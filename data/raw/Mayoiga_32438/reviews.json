            "content": "In the midst of all of the decent shows that have come out this season, a peculiar one has piqued my interest. This is of course a very special show, often described as being \"intentionally unintentionally funny\" by the people who know fuckall about what they are talking about. So why is this show so intentionally unintentionally funny? It isn't. Mayoiga is a show that had some of the worst writing I've ever seen and it seems to have picked up on that fact, albeit a little bit too late. What people seem to be missing is that when a show makes itself looks ridiculousand ends up being a mess, its' genres do not change by default as well. \"Erased was never a mystery hurr durr\". Enter: Teenage Angst, the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't actually that bad on paper. It's clich\u00e9 as hell but doesn't seem like something that can ruin a series all on its own. The most important factor here is the execution and you can probably guess that it's not so great. Mayoiga is a story about 30 social misfits and takes place in Nanakimura village, a village rumored to be a safe haven from society, where people who want  to escape from reality go to. So being the bright little crew they are, our cast makes an ingenious idea to organize a bus tour in order to leave their previous lives behind and start anew!\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, who thought it would be a good idea to have a cast of 30 characters within a 12 episode anime? That is literally spelling out disaster, no matter the execution. Short series usually have trouble with fleshing out the handful of people that make the main cast, but Mayoiga decided to take it to an entire new level like it was no big deal. You can only imagine how much the story as well as the characters suffer from this. 90% of them don't even get a backstory, and those who do get a 5 minute exaggeration of something terrible that happened in their lives.\\n\\n\r\nWith the premise and setting giving out so many horror vibes, as well as it having the same production crew that worked on Another, I had obviously jumped to the conclusion that this is a horror series. At least that's an efficient way to cut down a considerable portion of the cast, right? To my great disappointment, I was completely wrong. There is a single \"death\" to start the show off but other than that, it fails to deliver. I was at least going in with expectations that it'll be a fun and stupid ride like Another was, but ended up being thoroughly disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a good psychological series is practically impossible when every single character in your cast is borderline insane and / or delusional with very few exceptions. None of them act like normal human beings to begin with and their stories are exaggerated in the worst ways possible, trying as hard as they can to victimize them and justify their insane mindset, which is frankly impossible. The mystery is nonsensical and completely relies on the supernatural, which is a flaw in itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe lowest of the low. This is easily some of the worst characterization that I have seen in my entire life. Not only are over half of the characters completely useless, but they also lack any sort of rationality and common sense to add onto it. They are as deep as a puddle to put it lightly. Needless to say, there is absolutely 0 chemistry between any of them and the drama feels so incredibly forced, as they are shown to argue over the most trivial of things imaginable. Like in one of the highlights of the show where a character randomly decides to want to STAB another character because he didn't like his name. Just your everyday stuff.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is the spinning image of a goody two shoes, as he wants to help everyone and everything around him. I'm not sure how he managed to maintain this overly-positive outlook on life but it makes him one of the most annoying protagonists in the entire medium and somewhere along the way you end up wanting him to die a horrible death. Not to mention how oblivious he is to virtually everything around him, which sometimes really made me question how he has retained being a functioning member of society for the past 17 years.\\n\\n\r\nMasaki: I need to go to the bathroom\\n\r\nMitsumune: Do you want me to go with you?\\n\\n\r\nNo one else is really worth mentioning, although I do briefly want to touch upon something that impressed me. This series managed to make the most stereotypical fat guy that I have ever seen in my life. I'm not even exaggerating, all he does during the entirety of the series is either eat potato chips, tell us that he's tired or he just falls asleep and that is all there is to his character. Hats off to you, Mayoiga. We have truly hit rock bottom with this one.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very subpar and lacking in a lot of instances. It is bland in the worst way possible which you can probably gather by looking at Mitsumune's face for a solid 3 seconds or so. If I had to compare the style to something, it would definitely be to Another. The only difference being in the fact that Another had very saturated backgrounds and visuals to help enhance the theme and atmosphere of the show, while Mayoiga doesn't really have anything. As for the animation, it definitely reaches its peak about halfway through when they start showing us these giant CGI monsters. My personal favorite was the one-eyed furby penguin. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't something I have ever payed much thought nor attention to before, but I feel like it needs to be addressed for this specific case. The utilization of the sound effects is legitimately some of the worst that I have ever witnessed in any sort of media. In particular, there is this sound effect that sounds like bones breaking and it is used way too often for things it shouldn't be. The opening is your typical J-pop kyaa uguu song and the ending isn't spectacular either. Mitsumune's seiyuu made me want to slit my throat multiple times during the duration of the series so I can at least vouch that it made an impression. OST is forgettable and misplaced in most instances, which makes me take it even less seriously than before, if that's even possible. Warui hippopotamusuuu, rururu ruru ru.\\n\\n\r\nTo quote a good friend, \"It will be performed as an opera on the holodecks of the ships that disperse us into the highest of heavens. It all began... here. In this place, in this time, NOW. We were really all just clothed monkeys until Mayoiga allowed us to transcend our animalism. I shall sing its praises to all that shall come forth and be enlightened.\" With all of that being said, from a critical standpoint Mayoiga is just a complete and utter turd, give or take. It starts off as a bad series and devolves into something so horrid that not even the worst of plebs would dare poke with a 5-meter stick. So with your health in mind, even if you have some kind of morbid curiosity or are just an extreme masochist, this title should be proceeded with the utmost caution.",

            "content": "Yes, I apologize, but I'm going to have to join the Mayoiga debate, since there are apparently a large number of individuals in the anime community who are convinced that this beautiful disaster is somehow entirely unaware of the fact that it's a comedy. Now, I've heard a lot of things said about the matter, and so I would firstly like to clarify that I am not a diehard fan of the show trying to justify it, nor am I attempting to tell anyone that they are somehow stupid or foolish for assuming that Mayoiga is actually just mind-numbingly stupid trash. I don't even considerthis some enlightened or critical interpretation: this review's main purpose is to tell people that yes, this show is worth watching, and that yes, it is only worth watching if you look at it from the standpoint of \"Mizushima and Okada have fun messing around with B horror tropes\", because while there are certainly a fair number of blatant giveaways, much of Mayoiga's humor comes from the small details.\\n\\n\r\nSo why is Mayoiga good again?\\n\\n\r\nMost anime comedies are bad. That's an opinion, obviously, but it's one that I'm fairly hard-set on. Anime comedy derives mostly from physical comedy, overreactions, making fun of anime tropes, stupid sex jokes/boob jokes/food jokes, and other versions of uncreative/broad-appeal humor that gets reused over and over. When anime does set up good jokes, it often ruins them by pointing to them aggressively to make sure you understood the fact that yes, this was in fact supposed to be humor.\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga never does this. Once. What makes the show work more than anything is that it's so absurdly self serious one-hundred percent of the time. More than anything, this is likely why there is so much debate surrounding it, because there is never a single moment in the show where Mayoiga acknowledges that anything that it's doing is a joke. On the other hand though, this is what makes it so entertaining. You have stuff like Nyanta and Jigoku wandering around with amunition belts and assault rifles or Lovepon ceaselessly screaming about her gradually-escalating need to execute someone, and no one pays this even a lick of attention. It's pretty much the anime equivalent of that comic with the dog in the middle of an inferno saying \"this is fine.\" In Mayoiga, nonsense passes as logic and no one questions it once. The names \"Hyouketsu no Judgeness\" and \"Jack\" are acknowledged to be 'similar'. A character claiming to be able to see dead people is accepted as a valid argument as to why another character is not in fact a ghost. Medieval forms of witch torture are used as practical assessments of guilt, with a council of thoughtful glasses-pushing intellectuals actually trying to stab a twelve-year-old girl just to check if she'll bleed or not. The offhand way in which Mayoiga spews utter nonsense without ever treating its story and world as anything other than absolutely intense and important makes what would be an absolutely attrocious plot into a phenomenal piece of entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nBut it goes past that. Mayoiga's dialogue and overblown character tropes may be fun, but what really makes the show special is that it assumes that the audience has seen at least a few B horror movies and murder-mystery plots in their day, and it uses that to violently thrash their expectations in the most viscerally unsatisfying ways imaginable. If Mayoiga was a violent gorefest it would quickly slip into the realm of incoherence, lose the appeal of its nonsense dialogue, and turn into another Another (heh). But instead, Mayoiga capitalizes on lethargy and apathy. It treats its plot twists and reveals like inqonsequential details to skim over. Instead of whipping its characters up into a frenzy, it makes the majority of them lazy, subdued, whiny, and complacent. It devotes ominous attention to cast member that are never remotely relevant. If ever there were a perfect backdrop against which to place a few under-the-radar psychos and sociopaths, it's the one that Mayoiga creates through its easily-distracted mob. When characters start going missing, large portions of the cast are more concerned with existential reasoning or even debating the spelling of said character's names than with worrying about their own or their comrade's safety. Beyond this, Mayoiga goes so far as to present some of the worst direction concievably possible, pace itself in ways that make no sense, and demonstrate a staggering penchant for anticlimax right through to the very end. It could be argued that the plot was technically 'resolved', because it was, but it is done is such a way that you're left confused and slightly baffled, wondering 'wait, what? that's it? this is a story, weren't there supposed to be dramatic stakes?' and then you can't help but chuckle at the fact that Mayoiga got you good one last time as you realize that it couldn't have been any other way.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, Mayoiga is hilarious. I laughed out loud at least two or three times an episode on average, with plenty of chuckles in between, and I'm talking about from the very first episode. This is funny stuff. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, even for what it is, it's by no means perfect. I enjoyed the show immensely, but I still wish that it had been just a little bit better at what it does. The final third of the show is noticeably less funny than the rest, with a reliance on anticlimax and executing big moments horribly taking away from some of the show's momentum. In addition, the show is composed by Okada, who has always loved her melodrama, and this becomes more and more apparent as the number of faux-emotional flashbacks intensifies until that joke has been overdone and it loses its charm. If these flashbacks and idiotic backstories had become increasingly more absurd and creative perhaps this would have worked better, but the show's best backstories are mostly the early ones so unforunately this wasn't the case. In addition, it's usually the case the truly successful comedies succeed the way they do because they manage to be engaging even when they aren't throwing out jokes simply through atmosphere/intesity/actual plot, and again unfortunately when Mayoiga isn't making you laugh, it isn't really doing anything of note. In my opinion, this is what sets something like the first season of Jojo apart from the rest of the fold--even Mayoiga--in that even when Jojo isn't being immediately absurd, it manages to breed an atmosphere of fun and excitement that keeps you interested because it feels like an adventure and not just one big joke. So yeah, this thing is flawed. But that doesn't change the fact that it's a great time, and that it's consistent enough to not give you that empty feeling of 'I want to laugh more, I'm in a humorous mood, but the show's just not quite getting there\". With the right attitude, Mayoiga delivers.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end it kinda just makes me sad to see the show getting so much hate, because it's a kind of unique and truly dedicated comedy that we see rarely-to-never in anime, and it would be cool if more people could appreciate it. After watching people explode over stuff like Konosuba (personally, I find Konosuba to be, well, kinda garbage, but to each his own) I was excited to have an airing comedy that I was also invested in and could laugh along with the rest of the community. At this point, it seems a little late for that, but it's not to late for all you smart people out there who spend your time wisely and wait until the end of the season to see reviews and decide what looks like it's worth watching. Despite what almost everyone is saying to the contrary, I firmly believe that if you go into Mayoiga expecting a comedy and a self-aware but deadpan parody that you will likely find yourself happily laughing for twelve delightful episodes. Every type of humor isn't for everyone, granted, but for what it does Mayoiga is pretty much one-of-a-kind among anime, and I think it's worth giving a shot, even if just to see if it's for you.\\n\\n\r\nIn Mayoiga-esque fashion, here's the score breakdown loaded ino the end of the review now that it's almost entirely irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\nStory-- Decidedly unique. Better than Trasformers: Dark of the Moon. No other information necessary.\\n\\n\r\nArt-- Totally fucking terrible, the CGI looks like a bad skyrim mod.\\n\\n\r\nSound-- Surprisingly competent, could even be counted against the show because it's too effective. Opening is catchy AF.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-- You either love them or you Lovepon them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-- Really the only thing worth mentioning, it's a good time, that's enough of that.\\n\\n\r\nFin.\\n\\n\r\nHail Lovepon.",

            "content": "Watching Mayoiga is like opening a surprise package and finding out it's something you so fiercely hate, thus transitioning your expectations into a decaying death. The premise itself is interesting, and there's a sense of an odd feeling of triumph at the beginning because as rarely as it comes, to see a pure original 'lost somewhere' flick is definitely something you can look forward to with excessive hype and such was the case with myself. As a matter of fact, before the spring season began, I had Mayoiga at the top of my most anticipated shows list. But Mayoiga, or rather Trainwre- I mean... TheLost Village, turns out as a complete disaster. \\n\\n\r\nMayoiga begins with a bunch of ragtags together inside a bus heading towards a peculiar place known only as the Nanaki Village. The similarity between all the people, thirty to be precise, is that each and every one of them had a traumatic past of which they were all desperate to escape from. Nanaki Village is a place that is not on the map and no one knows about it, and no one can pin-point the location of the place. Nanaki Village doesn't exist. That is until a mysterious group known as \"It's Super Genesis\" or \"ISG\" for short discovers the exact location of Nanaki Village.  Various online users who make it through layers of protection of the ISG website, take part in this tour which is branded as the \"Start Life Over\" tour where people are seeking a world free of hassle and trying to relive their lives, escaping the reality. The irony in the story lies in the fact that \"changing your lives\" is something the adults should be doing, not a group of teenagers who have barely lived.\\n\\n\r\nA whopping thirty characters could all be in theory, regarded as our protagonists. But we all know that's not bound to happen in a show which consists of just twelve episodes. And that brings us to Mitsumune, the main character in which the show mostly revolves around and has the spotlight. For one, there is nothing that separates Mitsumune from the other thousands of generic main guys there are. He is shy, pathetic and single-minded who has a positive outlook no matter what happens. He is also very disloyal, so much so that he gives up on his best friend, who also joins him on the tour by the way, for a girl he met in the tour! Looking at Mitsumune makes you wonder why would such a phony guy even join on this tour? There's a backstory to him which is just as miserly as the show itself. As I said before, the first episode starts off with the tour organizer, Dahara, stating that only the people with gifted talent could ever break through the layers of their website and join the tour, which also makes you think as to how someone as dense as Mitsumune could have done that all by himself? Mayoiga is full of contradictions such as this. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are up to no good as well. A majority of them merely exist for plot conveniences, and that includes Mitsumune at times too, and have little to no in-depth characterization. Probably a few of them worth mentioning are Masaki, the mysterious girl to whom Mitsumune falls for. She plays a big role as the show progresses, but there are little traits to her character worth explaining. She's basically used as the embodiment of the emotional trope and is a pretty one-dimensional character. Hayato who goes by the pseudonym Speedstar, is a good friend of Mitsumune's. He acts as the support for Mitsumune and helps him out whenever he is in need. Speedstar is more suited to be the show's protagonist in my opinion as he's displayed as someone who has a strong willpower and personality. He undergoes a terrible characterization later on however which was a waste. A few characters act as a sidekick like Valkana, who is shown as a very angry man. Koharun, who is the one responsible for locating the Nanaki Village and Lovepon, who is probably the craziest in my opinion. All she ever talks is about executing and is a good example of a literal cardboard-cut \"yandere\" trope character. However, there's a backstory on her which was quite captivating and displayed the struggles she goes through as a kid. It's depressing since the show doesn't do justice at all to the backstory as she's used for mere conveniences by taking on a more active role in the coming episodes saying the exact same thing over and over again. \\n\\n\r\nIt's such a shame because Mayoiga has well-designed characters for an original show. The art isn't anything significant and is nothing but generic, but it doesn't necessarily mean bad. The characters and the backgrounds are drawn simple and not too exaggerated which helps the viewers settle in very quickly. But for the most part, there is a visible decline in the art and a good example of this are the first two episodes. The pilot episode has nice visuals but there are times when it goes downhill from there in the coming episodes. The CGI effects used later on suck for the most part. One of the main reasons being the totally absurd \"Monsters\" but yet there are moments where the characters are shown alongside the CGI-designed creatures and it all feels very underwhelming. The visuals for the opening/ending songs respectively are kept very minimal where they focus on merely introducing the characters. The ending especially only uses the faces of the characters in them with different characters in the next episode ending than the previous. Overall I have to say the art is pretty mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound aspect of Mayoiga is once again a mixed bag. On one hand: Fantastic opening and ending song, A few good soundtracks in between which play by the mood and the atmosphere etc. And then there is this task of voicing over two dozens of characters. Honestly, many of the characters' voices are done terribly and seemingly by amateurs in the industry. And it comes as no surprise for an anime which was supported by crowdfunding, to have budget issues and made by a small time studio. Many of the characters are played by the newer personnel or ones with little experience in voice acting and that is so very evident in Mayoiga. \\n\\n\r\nMayoiga is at times so insane that it matches the contemporaries of those anime which are so bad that they're good. It's a common expectation that with such a huge amount of cast, many will be put off to death soon and that does seem to be happening until it takes a completely different route. It's tough to tell after a few episodes if this is truly a mystery show, psychological drama or a satirical comedy. Mayoiga doesn't rely on gore to put off the viewers and be 'edgy'. But instead it uses hysterically pretentious philosophical dialogues and awful plot twists which literally does the trick and puts off everyone watching it and can be deemed as cringe-worthy. At this point I'm just gonna say avoid Mayoiga at all costs. It's an utter waste of time and nothing good will ever come out watching it. I'd also like to mention that this is the worst anime I've ever seen.\\n",

            "content": "Mayoiga (The Lost Village) is a really strange series and to watch it, you\u2019ll really need to do it with some attention or an open mind. I can\u2019t remember the last time I watched a show with such amount of absurdity, to a point where I feel just as lost as the characters in the story. Directed by Tsutomu Mizushima (Shirobako, Girls und Panzer), the series takes the genre of mystery but what you expect isn\u2019t what you\u2019ll likely get. And in many ways, Mayoiga sends a wrong message that makes the show look like a borderline comedy.\r\nAs an original series, the premise itself soundsinteresting. Think about it. You have a group of characters each with their own personalities but all end up in the same place, a village named Nanakimura. It invites a lot of questions about what takes place and the discoveries they\u2019ll make. Those who have seen series such as Another, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, and Ghost Hound may be in for a treat. On paper, the show looks intriguing. However, the first episode gave me a mixed impression especially when it introduces 30 characters. What goes on my mind is: how on Earth do they plan to give characterization with this many people? The show is also only 1 cour so my expectations was rather dense about how much they can focus on the story as well.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially, the show is pretty much about a group of characters being lost in a remote location after being dropped off by the bus driver. The setting (Lost Village) invites a lot of attention because by plot formulaic standards, there\u2019s bound for a lot to happen. It\u2019s not strange in the sense that everyone on this trip gets lost but why they are there. And it also sets up developments related to survival, trust issues, and possibly even death. The show already establishes a few given ideas though \u2013 being that no one really knows why they\u2019re there, what\u2019s at the village, or how to get back. There\u2019s a lot of diverse personalities all mixed in at once if we take at the characters individually. Their common goal of course is to get the hell away from there as fast as possible.\\n\\n\r\nOn paper, there\u2019s 30 characters but the series does manage to show some background stories for some of the more prominent individuals. Besides Mitsumune, we also get some storytelling about Hayato (Mitsumune\u2019s best friend), Valkana (a man that is trying to build a new life from his previous job), Lovepon (a girl obsessed with execution), Nyanta (a kid with fondness with guns), the mysterious Masaki with connections with the bus driver, and among others. While their background stories doesn\u2019t have direct connections to the main story, it does identify their characteristics. And that\u2019s an important part of the show. The characters in this series needs to know who each other are to build trust. In a place of unknown, the last thing they need is betrayal or turmoil between each other. The show only does a moderate job at crafting relationships because quite honestly, there\u2019s just too many characters to work around with. In retrospect, most of the character relationships are based more on how much they want to know about each other.\\n\\n\r\nAfter seeing a fair amount of episodes, I find it hard to understand the purpose of the show. Yes, it\u2019s supposed to be a thriller but a lot of times, I find it rather amusing with the amount of superstitious events that occurs in the series. Perhaps it\u2019s surreal comedy? Who knows but some of events going on are rather unbelievable. In addition, the story feels more like a skit where the characters are there for entertainment. Their established personalities become more and more evident as each episodes ventures on. At some point, I have to wonder if it series is trying to be unintentionally funny or not. For instance, the show at one point decided to actually make Lovepon into a prominent character for the viewers to take seriously despite her behavior being borderline insane. It\u2019s definitely not scary if that\u2019s the original purpose because just how ridiculous it has been. The first two episodes actually makes the series somewhat compelling because of the way it sets everything up. However, the amount of absurdity that builds up more and more and later feels just like popcorn comedy.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the artwork isn\u2019t great, it isn\u2019t bad either. It\u2019s more like somewhere between the middle where it\u2019s acceptable. The setting does have a genuine feeling of horror with its eerie atmosphere. Character designs aren\u2019t impressive but they are fresh enough to show that each individual has some unique trait. The fun part about the show is the character expressions as we see how they react to certain situations. Lovepon is the gold standard for this while there are times when see others behave in ways that are laughable.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack on most part works for the show. It works in the way that it portrays the atmospheric setting well. The OP and ED theme songs aren\u2019t very impressive but the OST has the general idea of giving mystery vibes. Character voice mannerism actually deserves some praise especially with the female characters because of how they react. Meanwhile, the show also crafts some dramatic scenery accompanied by the choreography of intense music at times. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhat did I just watch?\u201d You\u2019ll probably ask yourself that question more times than you can count by the time this show is over. Make no mistake, Mayoiga is more about entertainment than an intriguing mystery or horror story. It has the general premise but it hardly delivers at what it tries to do. There\u2019s also a lack of sorrow felt during the show despite some key staff involved and writing. So what is Mayoiga really? Is it a show that is \u201cso bad, it\u2019s good\u201d? Well to me, it\u2019s more of a \u201cI\u2019m so lost\u201d.\\n",

            "content": "It was like watching a train wreck, so bad, however so appealing to watch that you can't look away.\r\nEscapism is a major part of the story. Each of the 30 characters want to start their lives over again because of a troubling past. Now don't get me wrong, Mayoiga had, has a very interesting concept, plot, and story however I felt like it wasn't able to execute (get the pun) important things like dramatic scenes and capturing realistic emotions very well. The story and plot felt a bit too cliche, predictable, and badly written to the point where I don't even want to go backand re-watch it. The plot for each episode undoubtedly displayed more faults than corrections. Now ordinarily when I'm watching a show, it doesn't have to be too good nor too bad. As long as a show is unique, promising, and delivers great things then I'm okay with it. Unfortunately this was just not the case with The lost village. An entire episode of Mayoiga can be slow and very unbalanced in terms of what elements to the story are being used. So at the beginning of an episode I'll notice that drama will start, then some sort of action, later horror, then back to drama, the direction certain episodes would go in were just too complex. The so called \u201chorror\u201d is unfortunately not Mayoiga's strength. If anything dramatic and bizarre conclusions to an episode would be.\\n\r\nSome episodes you expect to see certain issues & concerns resolved however they are not looked into further. Yeah, they'll show a character who drowned and another who fell off a mountain or cliff however none of that is explained any further. The other characters quickly forget about those people who appeared to have met some sort of grim fate. I understand that there was an attempt made to keep a mystery flow to the lost village however for the most Part I didn't feel like it was working out properly. \\n\\n\r\nHow the producers tried to go about it made it look & feel unnatural, as if they were trying a bit too hard... well maybe not with the setting. I'll admit fog and the woods does make for an overused, yet satisfy place for events like these to occur. With regard to the characters back stories, I really disliked how long it took for me to get a proper introduction to each of their traumatic pasts. I felt like if back-stories were introduced during the earlier episodes and not midway maybe I could establish some sort of personal connection and really get to like the characters, I'll explain further down below. Out of the very few things that I did admire about the show was that every time an episode was ending it would always end with something completely insane or bizarre that would get me excited to watch the next episode.\\n\r\nIn fact, the #1 reason why I continued to go on with this show is because of that! I love the build up! I would say that it is in fact very intense. So intense that I would just be questions to myself and with others what could we see happen on the next episode. Dialogue was another issue I had however I think I'll discuss more about this a bit later. I thought the story was alright, not the best, however it was still tolerable and decent enough to be engaging. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest disappointment with the show had to be the cast of characters. In my opinion, all the characters were too plain. Their back stories, personalities, actions, I just could not establish a connection to any of the characters and that really made tension and other moments pleasurable to me. I'm not going to get exciting when some homosexual shooting arrows at people arrives. I'm not going to freak out when every character thinks that the adorable Masaki is a ghost. 30 characters, Thirty! Each with different personalities and trauma, after the show was finished I had no favorites, no characters that I really liked, none that I could really understand it was such an unpleasant experience seeing the characters interact. A majority of the time it was like watching a bunch of clueless children. I honestly, and for the first time in quite a long time and I mean almost 2 years times, I've watched a show where I didn't like any of the characters. Moving on, I felt like a majority of the characters were effortlessly written. By that I mean it was as if the team working on each episode didn't take their time to give most characters interesting characteristics. It was like all the group did was put a bunch of index cards with personalities written in a bag, shook it, pulled one out and said \u201cOkay, we have drawn crazy\u201d lets add a crazy personality to Love-pon, that's all. Each character acts according to certain archetype like dandere for Lion, or Nanko, nadeshiko for Masaki, genki for Nyanta etc. Characters did have the potential to be greater however. From what I saw, their actions, interactions, developments, I was not too impressed. I do not think it is possible for me to come back to this show just to see certain characters or relive special moments.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was really good. The special effects used to represent some characters fears or traumatizing life experiences looked both hilarious and amazing to a certain degree. I did notice that there were some animation problems, in particular I mean the moment in one episode where there are two Koharun's visible. Character designs were certainly interesting too. I admired the fact that no two characters looked alike. The animators made great use of CGI and 3D for silicone boob monster and other various things (I actually couldn't tell because that sort of animation was used during night settings.) Background settings looked pretty nice. I mentioned earlier that the main setting, fog, woods, mountains, etc(although cliche) works well with the stories plot because what better place to get away from all your troubles and start over again than an abandoned village out in the middle of boonies.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part I liked the soundtrack. The background music, the dramatic music worked pretty well when something strange, dramatic, or supernatural was occurring. The sound sort of helped add fear to the already hilarious joke of a \u201chorror\u201d show however, as stated earlier, they tried too hard. Music was quickly drowned out by the exaggerated screams and yells of characters in fear. Rule opening & ED songs were pretty great! I had no issues with Em' Sound effects held up pretty well, and everything else in general was good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAt times however the biggest enjoyment comes from the well executed (PUNS PUNS PUNS!!!) plot twist/bizarre endings of each episode. In all honesty, that was the biggest reason I had to finish this show. The directors knew, they knew that they were going to have a difficult time keeping things interesting for fans, so they purposely added the bizarre endings and twist just to keep fans like me coming back every week, Clever bastards. That aside, I don't really don't think this was Mari Okada best work compared to other projects she's worked on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Mayoiga has its issues and it just didn't have the lasting appealing for me. I won't think to myself a year later \u201cHmmm what was the name of that show where a bunch of people go on a crazy start life all over again trip?\u201d",

            "content": "The Lost Village is a rather unique show. Featuring a large cast of thirty named characters, acclaimed director Tsumotu Mizushima (Shirobako, Girls und Panzer, Dai Mahou Touge) and a similarly acclaimed writer Mari Okada (Ano Hana, Toradora, Nagi no Asakura); to call The Lost Village ambitious would be an understatement. In this review I intend to explain what makes The Lost Village brilliant whilst also explaining what makes this show as polarizing as it appears to be.\r\nThe Lost Village presents itself as a horror show. A bunch of kids and young adults board a bus to a mysterious village in order to rebuild their lives.On the way large there are constant references to suicide, cannibalism, and torture. An incredibly generic thriller horror opening. Typically this kind of show with a large initial cast fall into that brand of horror where most of the cast is 'spent' in either a gorey or a psychologically unnerving manner. That would normally be what draws people to the show initially, for example Higurashi. At the start of the season that is very much what I expected from The Lost Village: an over the top horror show with some incredibly silly deaths, basically Another. I couldn't have been more wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe Lost Village is a comedy show. It is a comedy show set in an amateur studentish horror show. Most anime comedy revolves around overt gags. You have a show, be it a comedy show or merely a show that utilizes a comedy, and in it a joke is presented to you. The joke is then commented on by the cast, usually a 'straight-man character'. Obviously this varies, from Key adaptation's very single skit focussed approaches to comedy, to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's approach of having ridiculous things be ridiculous but playing it entirely straight within the show itself. However, none of these is how The Lost Village approaches comedy. The humour in The Lost Village is instead more meta-structural. Playing with genre or anime-in-general expectations by 'looking' at the 'correct way' of doing things and then doing the opposite. \\n\\n\r\nAll thirty-something characters are all one dimensional flat characters with maybe one or two traits to each of them. You have the meowing gun fan, the earnest execution lover, that incredibly thirsty boy, and that's a joke. In a lesser show this would be atrocious. An entire cast of unlikable bland characters.  Yet the show constantly draws attention to not only how ridiculous the cast is, but also how genuine the cast is. That meowing gun lover will always be meowing, always will be in love with guns, and that is just their character. No tragic backstory, even when brought up, will explain that away like a traditional horror thriller would. The meowing gun fan isn't meowing because she was bullied as a kid, nor is the execution lover into execution as some form of vengeance over abuse.  Instead, The Lost Village's tragic backstories exist merely to poke fun at tragic backstories. To poke fun at itself, and to bring genuine laughter to it's audience.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost everything in the show revolves around taking it's horror thrilling premise and ruining it. Any tense moment will be butchered by traditionally bad shot composition. All movement in a scene being off camera, the focus of a scene being completely absent and the 180 degree rule being ignored, or just putting props in the way of the character talking for the sheer purpose of taking all tension that 'should' be in the scene away. Or perhaps, instead of using bad shot composition, what will ruin a scene is the cast just getting bored. Rather than grouping together, or splitting up in order to find the plot the vast majority of the time the cast state that they should be doing that and then immediately get bored and distracted. The show is completely consistent in it's contrivances. It's running jokes continue running and even reach climactic highs as the cast accidentally run across and have Plot happen to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe Plot in The Lost Village is a Plot of nothingness. Since it takes so long for the cast to actually 'get' anywhere what could typically have been a hamfisted appreciation of trauma instead takes an entire season to get going and then get's 'resolved' in bored characters speaking verbal shitposts at each other. These conversations about nothing, or about something important before getting distracted account for around half of all that happens in the show. It's ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nYet, even with all this ridiculous nothingness going on, The Lost Village has some genuine moments. These genuine moments, whilst laughed at in some form of another most, but not all, of the time, are well done. A character dealing with or coming to terms with their trauma is not laughed at. The traumas that the Plot of the show explores are not the jokes in and of themselves. The Lost Village cares deeply for it's cast of sometimes absurd archetypes, and sometimes oddly genuine people. In caring for them it cares deeply for it's audience. Genuine struggles are treated genuinely. There's no gratuitous abuse, and the only violence that's a joke in and of itself tends to revolve around The Big Bads being CG and terrible.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be easy to look at what The Lost Village does and compare it to check lists of good and bad writing and decide it is definitely of the former. But to consider the show bad because of this would be doing it a disservice. The Lost Village takes traditionally bad writing and direction and instead makes it good. The Lost Village uses the implicit 'joke' in stuff like The Room or Birdemic and makes it explicit. If you buy into the inconsistent consistency of it's premise The Lost Village is a precious show. An unmissable and unique experience. However, such an experience may be hard to get into, for by using traditionally bad techniques can be a major turn off making it impossible for one to get immersed in the fun.",

Most of them are fucking annoying, make me want to punch my computer's screen hoping my fist would break through dimension knock them the fuck out. God, fucking Lovepon and her EXECUTION! \r\nThis anime do a poor making me care about any of the characters. These characters are all losers who want to escape their lives because they fucking suck. We slowly learn how lamethey are and then we got their weird fucking trauma manifest as creepy fucking shit. One of them got silicon as his trauma monster because he got one implant inside his head to make him taller, fucking lol. I kid you not.\\n\\n\r\nEach episodes make you question the characters capability to use their brains because nothing they do make fucking sense. If you expect any good explaination for everything that's going in the series, you won't. I mean they explains it but its garbage. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I regret watching this anime. I never give an anime such a low score but this anime deserve all of it. Fucking garbage.",

            "content": "Anime may not be able to walk on your behalf but can make someone surprised by something unexpected. Yes, this is Mayoiga. I was quite excited to make a review about this anime, please read slowly and this is my view objectively. WARNING : MAY CONTAIN SPOILER.\r\nWhat's the first time I say? It can\u2019t be believed! Well, it may sound like an exaggeration but this is the real situation. When you see this anime, you look, you see the synopsis or watch the preview. Moreover with mystery, predictable, nor may you and me, must have been quite challenged and put it into your watch list.With Another or Higurashi who\u2019s capable of attracting the attention of many people. You put this anime with very high expectations.\\n\\n\r\nI'll first start of the story, the story is the main problem of this anime. Telling about the village are missing, we could see some early episodes was the introduction stage about situations and characters. My first assumption is development is quite slow, probably rather too wordy. But increasingly there began to emerge a variety of issues and a few episodes, I still wondering about my confusion on this anime. Will be brought where the story? Very boring. That's wrong here, me, and (perhaps) we were all wrong with expecting a creepy story, tense or foster a sense of excitement, as we watch anime \"Another\". So my first assumption didn\u2019t last long, when I tried to watch closely and be careful. My second assumption is \u201cmy decision was wrong\u201d. This anime wants to make the audience follow their progress slowly, not rush. I realize that this anime producer successfully twist my mind and finally presented things that \u201csped away\u201d from my estimation. It turns out the story is not that simple packaging.\\n\\n\r\nBut I can\u2019t dismiss that progress is slow, I was a bit annoyed they\u2019re always debating things that are not necessary. But instead of all the events that happened, there is a debate and misunderstanding that leads us to understand their characters. Very obvious, with the disappearance of their friend, they don\u2019t understand each other and the things they didn\u2019t expect to happen, it makes them depressed and inner conflict begins. Finally, we can understand their character. And their characters were, unwittingly, is key to the root of the problems they face and the secret behind the Nanaki village. Honestly, I was a little regret not trying to enjoy the plot. Because my mind might have considered ugly about this anime. But I take that back. Merger of drama-mystery is very nice! Remember the first time they\u2019re in the bus and do a self-introduction? They reason aren\u2019t much different, essentially those who follow the tour wasn\u2019t just avid fans of mystery, but they really try to live a new life and escape from their past. This reminds me of Aoi Bungaku, from taking place setting, story and atmosphere are different. But the point is the same, telling us about the issues facing them and when they tried to escape and live a new life. Fear and regret haunt wherever they go. Curiosity will be answered little by little in each episode, the lost village, traditional songs, this is the mystery. Not a ghost or anything physical shock. Story : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNext, there is no need comment about the art, coloring or effect. The characters is described very cute, and quite creepy monster! Especially of monsters who\u2019s attacking lovepyon, if I pay attention, movement feels real. Well, I actually really like, and I think there is no problem about this. Because, basically every anime has a different style. Picture: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThird, talk about sound, I think the opening and closing songs are good. Instrumental and lyrics are very supportive. The opening song reminds me a little bit with Subete F ga ni naru, compared to show something creepy, but the depiction of the characters themselves. Real despair. Sound : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, is bad? No. They played very well at all. Because so many of the characters in this anime, initially quite hard to remember their names apart before they call each other names. Can be seen, so many characters with diverse characters. There are like prostitutes, taciturn, grumpy, and so forth. But perhaps of all the characters are quite caught my attention was lovepyon and not the protagonist, mitsumune. She is very sweet, but with a different physical nature,she is creepy and autism. Always talk about the execution, execution and execution. Fortunately their acting and actions unsatisfactory, if not, I would feel bored with the progress of the story is fairly slow. This is the appeal of this anime, their character. Their characters feel real and make it more alive. Characters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs of my exposition above, my view of this anime is not bad, but I\u2019m quite satisfied. Progress was slow, made sense of curiosity, and others. Let me emphasize here that try to enjoy and feel the sensation. Although the mystery was not outstanding but still make us curious. Enjoyment : 9/10",

            "content": "Welcome to \"so bad it's actually funny\" \u2013 the anime. Sort of.\r\nIt's hard to explain just how bad Mayoiga actually is without seeing it with your own eyes, but if I were to use one word to describe it then it'd be \"amateurish\". It feels like both the scriptwriting and the directing were done by a group of 14-year-olds for some school film project or something. It's like one of those second-rate western horror flicks that you solely watch for shits and giggles, except put in an anime format for even greater effect. You might be familiar with the 2012 anime \"Another\": it was ananime which was supposed to be a horror/mystery show yet it became more known for being an unintentional comedy due to how hilariously bad it was at creating suspense and because of how stupid its death scenes were. Guess what; Mayoiga and Another share the same director... and as a result Mayoiga is basically the same deal all over again, though with a lot less casualties in it this time. Actually that's not entirely fair; Mayoiga is even worse.\\n\\n\r\nWithin the first 5 minutes of the very first episode, we're introduced to *30* new characters, all with their own self-introductions. I have seriously never seen an anime before which overwhelms you to such an extent right from the start with so many new names to learn. How is anyone supposed to remember them all? Long story short, you won't. Don't even try. And besides, as you'll find out, the characters are all terrible anyway so spare yourself the effort.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the story starts out with a bus filled with 30 unfamiliar people bound for a mysterious rural settlement called \"Nanaki Village\", a place which supposedly cannot be found on any map for unknown reasons. The purpose of the trip is supposedly for all the passengers to start over with new lives for themselves due to their respective personal circumstances. After some troubles, they arrive at the village only to find out that it's abandoned, and soon enough strange things start happening around them. Some people disappear whilst exploring the village, and mysterious claw marks dripping with blood are found in the forest. This all has the setup for an obvious horror story where people will get killed from the shadows or something along those lines, which would have been the obvious solution to the problem of the overwhelming size of the character cast: I.E: by killing off the majority of them. But strangely enough that's not what happens.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, Mayoiga descends down a spiral of \"wtf am I watching\" as the characters first turn on each other only to then keep changing their minds on who's guilty of what every 2 minutes, and absurd supernatural events seemingly start to occur with \"monsters\" straight out of Disneyland appearing everywhere. It's one big scrambled mess which barely makes any sense, but above all it's completely impossible to take seriously. I find it hard to believe that you're really supposed to be scared or intrigued by this, because the only thing it ever makes you do is laugh out loud at how unbelievably stupid and nonsensical the things that are happening are. And while the story admittedly does start to make sense towards the end, at that point you don't even care anymore.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes Mayoiga stand out though is the character cast itself. I don't really know how to put this other than that it's absolutely *horrible*. Like record levels of awful. I've already mentioned the huge problem of it being impossible to remember the names of more than a handful of them, but on top of that not a single one of them is likable. At all. They all behave like complete and utter retards from start to finish, blatantly changing their opinions whenever someone else brings up any new piece of information, they all have needlessly clich\u00e9 and bland backstories which you don't even want to hear in the first place, and they're just plain annoying to watch. They're completely incapable of handling the situation they find themselves in and they act paranoid beyond belief for almost no reason. I guess you could argue that a group of people who think that running away from society by joining some shady bus trip to a rural village probably aren't the smartest people to begin with, but still. That sounds more like a bad excuse than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC is a weak, gullible boy called Mitsumune who feels like the most unsuitable person imaginable to be the protagonist of a horror/mystery show, and he just ends up coming off as annoying more often than not. Worst of all though, there's this one psychopathic girl called Lovepon who does nothing but desperately yell the word \"Execute!\" at any given moment, and is one of the most obnoxious characters I've ever seen. She reminds me of Nina Einstein from Code Geass a lot (protip: that's not a good thing). She wants to kill everyone for the slightest suspicious move, yet everyone else seems to trust her instincts completely above anyone else who says otherwise. Like really? Can't you like\u2026 see that this girl is completely mentally unstable? Why are you going along with her as if she's reliable or something? I seriously don't get it. Who's more stupid: the idiot or the people who actually believe in her? In any case the entire cast are basically cardboard cutouts of various common anime tropes, with their specific traits cranked up to the max but their IQ dragged down to under 50. There is absolutely nothing to make the viewers feel any sympathy or connection to them, and as a result you just end up not caring about what happens to them. There is basically no depth or character development at all. Yes, we get a lot of tragic backstories from them spoon-fed to us, but those are all so incredibly bland and generic that it doesn't actually help their cause much to speak of. Rather it just ends up feeling like a waste of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nSo as far as being a horror/mystery goes, Mayoiga is in my mind one of the worst anime ever made. However, there is one saving grace for this show, albeit an unintentional one. And that is quite simply that it's actually pretty funny. Sure it's for all the wrong reasons, but either way the sheer amount of stupidity in the scriptwriting results in some comedic genius. The characters consistently do the most idiotic things that will catch you off guard and just make you laugh at how dumb they are. And don't even get me started on the so-called \"horror\" elements of this show. Just... just see for yourselves and you'll see what I mean; they look so ridiculously dumb it's hilarious. And because of that, the actual entertainment value of this anime is actually decent despite it being awful in basically all other categories, hence why I'm still generous enough to give it a 4 in the end. As for whether being \"so bad it's funny\" is enough of a motivation to actually watch the show though... well that probably just comes down to your sense of humor. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. Only one way to find out. Mayoiga is not an anime you laugh with. It's an anime you laugh at.",

This anime was tagged as Mystery and for the entirety of it I was just left wondering at awe in every episode. Even though the flow of the story was bad and it could've gone way better, I was able to enjoy this anime because of how crazy it is and how people are getting frustrated over it.\r\nStory(6)\r\nYeah the story is pretty bland and the flow is abit horrible but it's certainly not mediocre because it is pretty damn unique.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8)\\n\r\nThe visuals were great and the monsters/Nanaki were just awesomely creepy.\\n\\n\r\nSound(8)\\n\r\nThe audio was pretty great actually.

The story about being lost at a certain village with bunch of people who has psychological scars piqued my interest. Most people had dropped this because there are quite a few who had written some bad comments about this particular anime (DON'T JUST JUMP INTO THE BANDWAGON). But why won't you give this a shot. It's only worth 12 episodes, the art is not bad and the music is outstanding. This is not everyone'scup of tea but why don't you give this a watch and judge this for yourself. My only issue about this anime is that it contains a lot of characters and because of that, some characters were not executed properly and the ending could have been better. This should've been longer because the theme was really good and the characters were really interesting. This should've been longer to execute the plot more properly. This should've been longer for the characters to develop more. This anime should've been a bit longer. It's very promising, the art is great, the soundtrack is great, and the characters are interesting. All I see is an anime full of potential and it should've been a bit longer.",

            "content": "Remember when \"Lost\" (American Live Action Series) became an omelette of horrible ideas? \"Bus Show\" creators must have thought that was good writing and made a show out of it.\r\n*Spoiler Alert*\r\nThe cast is one of many assaults on one's sanity. The characters as I recall are listed like this: Harem Gay, Harem Gay's Best Friend, Love Interest (sometimes Bow Girl), Pikachu, Uzi Chick, Military Guy, Pirate Jack, Other Jack, Larry (refer to Phoenix Wright), Execute Girl, Soy Latte (actual name), Small Beard, and Black Dude. There are a ton of other people, but no one cares. This show damned itself by having such a largecast in such a small show. There were attempts to make us relate to and like this enormous cast. Unfortunately, you cannot have character development or character-viewer relations built between so many people as quickly as they tried to make this happen. They failed at both jobs. \\n\\n\r\nHow are all these interesting people together in the same place? They took the bus to a village where they wanted to make a commune of dysfunctional kids. This village is something something Nanaki something something ghosts from your past something something giant tit. Yes, a literal giant tit haunted Military Guy. He is not the only guy with a stupid background and a stupid spirit/inner demon. Our resident hard-ass Small Beard is terrified of Thomas the Tank Engine with googly eyes because he was laughed during work because his failed plans. The giant penguin and Horde mount are debatably the most legitimate inner fears. The sheer amount of stupid ideas made me feel like a brain surgeon was giving me a noogie with grip tape. It hurts. \\n\\n\r\nThe only hope for the show after episode 2/3 was to go full slasher flick. Cheesy slasher flicks are easy to execute and no one expects a good twist at the end. Instead Black Dude isn't actually dead. He was talking to a guy he called God who was a researcher on the village because he was interested in bullshit. He could have studied manure and accomplish more than what he did. \\n\\n\r\nIn the very end after everyone made peace with their inner demons and after one of the kids have to say that it is some random chick that was the bad guy all along, because they didn't specify that well enough, they sang a song called the Unlucky Hippopotamus. That is what every unfortunate viewer of the show is. An Unlucky Hippopotamus. Congrats.\\n",

If MAL offered negative scores, I may have spitefully given it a -2 rather than a positive one.\r\nI trudged through all twelve episodes, wasting 22 minutes of my life every week hoping that somehow, the plot would actually slowly turn good, and the characters wouldn't be so goddamn obnoxious. Didn't happen. I'm asking God for a refund of those minutes after I die one day.\r\nFirst off: Why the everloving frick would you have 30 characters in a show that's only twelve episodes?! With so little time to develop anyone as a character, it'sa wonder that they even thought that that was a good idea. Honestly, over 2/3 the cast could've been tossed away and nothing from the show would've changed. It was an unnecessary waste and barely anyone was given decent character development. In so-called horror/mystery shows such as this, it is crucial to have characters that the audience can root for or relate to. No such thing here. By the time episode 2-3 finished  practically everyone watching was hoping that the whole cast would just die. Not to mention, the characters who are presented more often are meh at best and fucking annoying at worst. They're all one-trick ponies who have one defining trait and nothing else explored about them. They have \"\"backstories\"\", but those are just another bad attempt at trying to get the viewer to sympathize for them (one was bullied, one tried to get into the military and failed, one did something wrong on a business deal, one was abused by a stepfather, etc.) and though you may feel bad for them a bit, it doesn't change the fact that most of them are useless and annoying characters. There are points where you may think that certain people got character development, and then, BAM! They reverted back to the way they were. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \\n\\n\r\nI'd talk about a story if there actually was one. Every time there's a mystery, there's always a crappy, half-assed explanation, followed by another mystery that is inevitably going to end up with the same crappy half-assed explanation by the next episode. At the series' end, there were still many questions left unanswered. The characters themselves are so annoying that it's actually hard to focus on the story (or on whether the story is actually there or not). \\n\\n\r\nThe art is the best part of the series. It's not too bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP/ED were nice to listen to, but they're easily skippable. I didn't really pay attention to the sound in the series otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: unless you are fond of subjecting yourself to torture in all sorts of forms, don't watch this show. it's a waste of your time.",

Though I always try to view anime in a positive light, I can't deny that Mayoiga is a great example of this. I mean it was so mediocre and pretentious and it just fell into an eternal abyss of dissapointment. \r\nThe lost village is the type of show that tries several ideas and concepts but fails miserably at several of these endeavors. It desperately attempts to incorporate deep themes but can hardly get down dynamic characterization and development, not to mention a completely muddled narrative.\r\n The story ofMayoiga follows thirty young individuals who are going to a village to escape all of their problems. This is an incredibly promising concept which could have been amazing if it was handled and developed properly. However a main issue is that a core story doesn't really appear until midway through the entire series. This leads to much confusion throughout the entire series because even after a narrative is established it doesn't take long for it to completely fall apart. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters of Mayoiga had great potential. The character of mitsumune had an interesting backstory and some valid motivation. However he is a really annoying and bland character and he hardly grows throughout the story. Masaki is kind of the standard timid quiet innocent girl that is very generic. Koharun was also pretty bland but there was a good plot twist involving her. Hayato was probably the best and most interesting character and his motives were very relatable. \\n\\n\r\nThe other side characters in Mayoiga is the perfect example of a large amount of characters who don't mean crap to the viewer. Honestly just info dumping their backstories at random is not a good way to develop a character. Their were a couple of semi-interesting side characters but the rest were just hit garbage. The cast was way too big and it really hindered the potential of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes of accepting your psychological scars is explored through characters I can hard,y care about. This makes the anime very pretentious due to it trying to be deep but failing miserably. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of Mayoiga is actually good. There is a feel of modern polish and I had no problem with it. The voice acting was also good and the actors portrayed their respective characters accurately. The music was excellent with a great opening and ending themes. The ost also built good atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Mayoiga is a series that had an amazing amount of potential in its premise but just completely flopped. It has some redeemable aspects but there are much better less pretentious mystery anime out there so I can't reccomened this anime.",

            "content": "Hey, are you looking for a well made mystery anime that boasts a suspenseful plot with intriguing characters? Then DON'T watch Mayoiga! This show failed miserably to be the good mystery anime that it tried so hard to be. Mayoiga got consistently worse and more agrivating to watch as each episode passed by. In fact, it almost drove me to take a bus tour to an abandoned town divode of life and technology myself just so that I wouldn't have to watch this disgrace on my PC every week.\r\nPlot: 1/10\r\nWith an intriguing (albeit kinda stupid) premise, I figured that the overall story would at leastbe somewhat interesting. However, since episode one the plot practically disappeared in a similar way to how some of the characters in this show vanished. And by that I mean in a vague and unexplained manner. The writers just seemed to disregard whatever plot elements they had in mind to specifically focus on the stupidity of the characters. The story doesn't go anywhere due to the singular focus on the idiotic decisions made by the anime's cast. Mayoiga unintentionally transferred from a mystery to a comedy. I won't go into detail on this point, but if you watch the anime, you'll understand where I'm coming from. The writing in this show is absolutely horrid.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite basic. The majority of the characters each have their own original design, although they're animated in a rather simplistic manner. There's not much to say about the scenery, which is also kind of underwhelming. My main issue has to be the cgi monsters that appear. They're so poorly designed that I couldn't help but chuckle a bit when I first saw them. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme song is rather average and isn't anything special. The ending is mediocre and skippable. The background soundtrack helps keep the mood tense and edgy during suspenseful scenes- oh wait, there aren't any in this anime! The voice acting is average and bland, and I really don't like the main characters voice. It's rather annoying. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you ever decide to create a twelve episode long anime, never, under any circumstances, have a cast of over thirty characters. That's right, the geniuses who created Mayoiga thought that they'd be able to effectively develop OVER THIRTY CHARACTERS in just TWELVE EPISODES. As you can imagine, the majority of the characters don't even have a personality, much less any development. Practically all of the characters are so stupid that I almost want to smash my head through a concrete tablet when I watch them. They're so disorganized, paranoid, and have no idea how to deal with the undesirable situations that they find themselves in. Then again, what else can you expect from a bunch of ignoramuses who want to escape society by taking a sketchy bus tour to an uncharted town that has a very probable chance of not even existing. Oh, and instead of developing as characters as the anime progressed, the doofuses in this show somehow manage to get even stupider and more annoying with each passing episode. Now that's an accomplishment!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I had hopes that Mayorga would be able to keep me entertained, my expectations were shattered almost immediately. By the latter half of the anime I even started cringing every time a character said something stupid, which was approximately every time they opened their mouths. While I was initially intrigued with this show due to the mysterious aspects of Mayoiga, I later found myself laughing at scenes that I assume were meant to be \"unnerving\" or \"scary\" due to Mayoiga's poor execution mixed with its abysmal cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was very clear from the beginning that Mayoiga had the makings of a flawed anime. Nonetheless, I held on to the hope that it would be able to find some success. Unfortunately, the show just got worse and worse with each passing episode until it reached a point where it actually became painful to watch. Overall, Mayoiga is simply a very poorly constructed show that failed to deliver.",

            "content": "I went into this anime with the expectation that it would have a very Danganronpa-esque feel, minus the hope versus despair struggle. As it turns out, I was wrong because I kept hoping it would get better as the show went on and was met instead with disappointment and despair that a show as bland as Mayoiga wasn't canceled by the third episode.\r\nAll this poorly structured show has to offer is four and a half hours of content so boring that it will make watching paint dry a thrill by comparison.\r\nIronically, despite not killing even one of the thirty characters first introduced, this anime managedto be lifeless all the way to the very end. I couldn't bring myself to care about a single person introduced except the bus driver. I could barely remember more than three of the characters' names, and most of that is only due to the fact that they were being constantly shouted throughout the episodes. Because Mayoiga failed to point out just one or two protagonists, much of the screentime that could've helped develop stronger viewer connections was wasted on scenes with minor characters that truly didn't contribute to the story whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this is certainly not the first anime to have characters that suffer from same-face syndrome, it didn't help that everyone also reacted to every situation in one of two ways: unnecessary anger or complete calm. Occasionally, they would act finnicky and contradict themselves to progress the story. Eventually, these responses were so predictable that I found myself struggling to keep my eyes open, even as the characters faced perilous situations because, morality considered, I simply didn't care what happened to them. This apathy towards the enormous cast is mainly attributed to having way too many characters thrown at the viewer within the first few minutes and on top of that, attaching meaningless nicknames to every single one and switching between those and their real names for most of the series. Two's company, three's a crowd, and Mayoiga is a trainwreck. I wish it were a bus wreck so that maybe half of the cast could've been taken out and this anime would have a chance of being kind of okay.\\n\\n\r\nWhile mysteries can be criticized for many things, the one thing they ought not be lacking in is intrigue. Viewers should be captivated by the story and anticipate answers to the questions posed by a mystery show and yet, each of the alluring ideas posed in the first episode were met with pretty understimulating explanations. These unsatisfying shortcomings sprinkled into the disorganized plotline were widely responsible for the decline of interest in the engimas that remained. There were far too many useless diversions to the main mystery at inopportune times which may have intended to build suspense but backfired horribly. A few of the characters' tragic backstories were developed which, one would hope, usually helps viewers relate. (Spoiler alert: it didn't work.) The others were thrown under the bus (not literally, but I crossed my fingers for this a lot) although perhaps this is a blessing because I would likely find the insides of my eyelids more interesting. Ultimately, if I don't care about a character, I'm not going to care about their past, no matter how traumatic you attempt to convince me it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe final episode left me just as disillusioned as I always am after staring at Mayoiga for 24-ish minutes and asking myself when I became such a masochist. The conclusion fell flat and truly, I'm not mad... I'm just disappointed. The unveiling of the antagonist's motive for pulling the strings behind the scenes was sketchy at best, as it didn't really explain most of their actions or how they could've pulled off what they did. A lot of loose ends were left untied and surprise, surprise, the climax of the story was so underwhelming I think I'll never have to take Zzzquil to go to sleep again. \\n\\n\r\nTldr; \"The Lost Village\" should be changed to \"The Lost Interest.\" I've yawned so much watching this series that I'm going to join Evanescence so someone can wake me up inside.

            "content": "I have seen bad anime and good anime come and go, but whenever a good anime is presented I am either disappointed or frustrated with the bandwagons attached to it. Luckily, Mayoiga is not one of these anime. Originally I gave Mayoiga a 1, but after removing parts of my ego there are some parts that make Mayoiga a bit more than a pathetic anime. This review will have no spoilers and the purpose is to convince you to rewatch or begin to watch Mayoiga.\r\nStory: \r\nMayoiga is about a group of isolationists that decide to move into a village so that they can restart theirlives. Immediately we understand that this anime is about exiles and we discover why they are exiles exactly because none of them are memorable. The main hook of this anime is the mystery of the village. The romance isn't the strong suit and when the mystery is revealed I have a hard time understanding what is real and what is not real. Story is not the strong suit by far, but what makes it better than dreadful (2) is that it has a narrative in mind and does not forget important plot points to our main character's trauma. Despite this, you will often find that a large cast of characters would be difficult to work with in 12 episodes. (3)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt is always a debatable category. I thought it was fine because it shows the defining characteristic of each character. When the art does not do this, it portrays average characters in a less than average story. Does this sound familiar? Mayoiga fits the horror-genre archetype! Since I do not want to reveal and spoilers, I will say that the CG at this time was terrifying and it fits perfectly with the mystery of the village. (6)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI liked the opening and ending... only if they were for a different show. I find that the upbeat and sad nature of these songs do not define the show and although it serves to hype me for the next episode it does not hype me for the story or characters. The overall soundtrack has a bunch of ambiance that seems offsetting, yet it somehow fits when understanding what a train wreck this anime really is. The best song you will hear, however, is the hippopotamus song. (3)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime are generic and flat. I wasn't rooting for any of the characters except 2 of them: the female tour guide and the bus driver. The only thing to keep in mind is that literally all of these people are isolationists. We often define each of these characters for a trait that society deems immoral like we have a character that enjoys executions and another that enjoys killing. Those are the extreme examples, but some other examples are also beauty and unemployment. There are so many different people here that I could not tell what the point of Mayogia really was. (1)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI don't count my enjoyment to the overall score but I will say that I was enjoyed enough to finish the 12 episode run. I never felt like sleeping through the show at any given point and I think its best to treat this show as a comedy rather than an actual mystery. (5)\\n\\n\r\nIf you have time in your hands before the next season starts than I recommend checking out Mayoiga to pass the time. Just know that you will gain minor enjoyment and a loss of time.",

            "content": "In the midst of all of the decent shows that have come out this season, a peculiar one has piqued my interest. This is of course a very special show, often described as being \"intentionally unintentionally funny\" by the people who know fuckall about what they are talking about. So why is this show so intentionally unintentionally funny? It isn't. Mayoiga is a show that had some of the worst writing I've ever seen and it seems to have picked up on that fact, albeit a little bit too late. What people seem to be missing is that when a show makes itself looks ridiculousand ends up being a mess, its' genres do not change by default as well. \"Erased was never a mystery hurr durr\". Enter: Teenage Angst, the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't actually that bad on paper. It's clich\u00e9 as hell but doesn't seem like something that can ruin a series all on its own. The most important factor here is the execution and you can probably guess that it's not so great. Mayoiga is a story about 30 social misfits and takes place in Nanakimura village, a village rumored to be a safe haven from society, where people who want  to escape from reality go to. So being the bright little crew they are, our cast makes an ingenious idea to organize a bus tour in order to leave their previous lives behind and start anew!\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, who thought it would be a good idea to have a cast of 30 characters within a 12 episode anime? That is literally spelling out disaster, no matter the execution. Short series usually have trouble with fleshing out the handful of people that make the main cast, but Mayoiga decided to take it to an entire new level like it was no big deal. You can only imagine how much the story as well as the characters suffer from this. 90% of them don't even get a backstory, and those who do get a 5 minute exaggeration of something terrible that happened in their lives.\\n\\n\r\nWith the premise and setting giving out so many horror vibes, as well as it having the same production crew that worked on Another, I had obviously jumped to the conclusion that this is a horror series. At least that's an efficient way to cut down a considerable portion of the cast, right? To my great disappointment, I was completely wrong. There is a single \"death\" to start the show off but other than that, it fails to deliver. I was at least going in with expectations that it'll be a fun and stupid ride like Another was, but ended up being thoroughly disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a good psychological series is practically impossible when every single character in your cast is borderline insane and / or delusional with very few exceptions. None of them act like normal human beings to begin with and their stories are exaggerated in the worst ways possible, trying as hard as they can to victimize them and justify their insane mindset, which is frankly impossible. The mystery is nonsensical and completely relies on the supernatural, which is a flaw in itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe lowest of the low. This is easily some of the worst characterization that I have seen in my entire life. Not only are over half of the characters completely useless, but they also lack any sort of rationality and common sense to add onto it. They are as deep as a puddle to put it lightly. Needless to say, there is absolutely 0 chemistry between any of them and the drama feels so incredibly forced, as they are shown to argue over the most trivial of things imaginable. Like in one of the highlights of the show where a character randomly decides to want to STAB another character because he didn't like his name. Just your everyday stuff.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is the spinning image of a goody two shoes, as he wants to help everyone and everything around him. I'm not sure how he managed to maintain this overly-positive outlook on life but it makes him one of the most annoying protagonists in the entire medium and somewhere along the way you end up wanting him to die a horrible death. Not to mention how oblivious he is to virtually everything around him, which sometimes really made me question how he has retained being a functioning member of society for the past 17 years.\\n\\n\r\nMasaki: I need to go to the bathroom\\n\r\nMitsumune: Do you want me to go with you?\\n\\n\r\nNo one else is really worth mentioning, although I do briefly want to touch upon something that impressed me. This series managed to make the most stereotypical fat guy that I have ever seen in my life. I'm not even exaggerating, all he does during the entirety of the series is either eat potato chips, tell us that he's tired or he just falls asleep and that is all there is to his character. Hats off to you, Mayoiga. We have truly hit rock bottom with this one.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very subpar and lacking in a lot of instances. It is bland in the worst way possible which you can probably gather by looking at Mitsumune's face for a solid 3 seconds or so. If I had to compare the style to something, it would definitely be to Another. The only difference being in the fact that Another had very saturated backgrounds and visuals to help enhance the theme and atmosphere of the show, while Mayoiga doesn't really have anything. As for the animation, it definitely reaches its peak about halfway through when they start showing us these giant CGI monsters. My personal favorite was the one-eyed furby penguin. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't something I have ever payed much thought nor attention to before, but I feel like it needs to be addressed for this specific case. The utilization of the sound effects is legitimately some of the worst that I have ever witnessed in any sort of media. In particular, there is this sound effect that sounds like bones breaking and it is used way too often for things it shouldn't be. The opening is your typical J-pop kyaa uguu song and the ending isn't spectacular either. Mitsumune's seiyuu made me want to slit my throat multiple times during the duration of the series so I can at least vouch that it made an impression. OST is forgettable and misplaced in most instances, which makes me take it even less seriously than before, if that's even possible. Warui hippopotamusuuu, rururu ruru ru.\\n\\n\r\nTo quote a good friend, \"It will be performed as an opera on the holodecks of the ships that disperse us into the highest of heavens. It all began... here. In this place, in this time, NOW. We were really all just clothed monkeys until Mayoiga allowed us to transcend our animalism. I shall sing its praises to all that shall come forth and be enlightened.\" With all of that being said, from a critical standpoint Mayoiga is just a complete and utter turd, give or take. It starts off as a bad series and devolves into something so horrid that not even the worst of plebs would dare poke with a 5-meter stick. So with your health in mind, even if you have some kind of morbid curiosity or are just an extreme masochist, this title should be proceeded with the utmost caution.",

Now, I've heard a lot of things said about the matter, and so I would firstly like to clarify that I am not a diehard fan of the show trying to justify it, nor am I attempting to tell anyone that they are somehow stupid or foolish for assuming that Mayoiga is actually just mind-numbingly stupid trash. I don't even considerthis some enlightened or critical interpretation: this review's main purpose is to tell people that yes, this show is worth watching, and that yes, it is only worth watching if you look at it from the standpoint of \"Mizushima and Okada have fun messing around with B horror tropes\", because while there are certainly a fair number of blatant giveaways, much of Mayoiga's humor comes from the small details.\\n\\n\r\nSo why is Mayoiga good again?\\n\\n\r\nMost anime comedies are bad. That's an opinion, obviously, but it's one that I'm fairly hard-set on. Anime comedy derives mostly from physical comedy, overreactions, making fun of anime tropes, stupid sex jokes/boob jokes/food jokes, and other versions of uncreative/broad-appeal humor that gets reused over and over. When anime does set up good jokes, it often ruins them by pointing to them aggressively to make sure you understood the fact that yes, this was in fact supposed to be humor.\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga never does this. Once. What makes the show work more than anything is that it's so absurdly self serious one-hundred percent of the time. More than anything, this is likely why there is so much debate surrounding it, because there is never a single moment in the show where Mayoiga acknowledges that anything that it's doing is a joke. On the other hand though, this is what makes it so entertaining. You have stuff like Nyanta and Jigoku wandering around with amunition belts and assault rifles or Lovepon ceaselessly screaming about her gradually-escalating need to execute someone, and no one pays this even a lick of attention. It's pretty much the anime equivalent of that comic with the dog in the middle of an inferno saying \"this is fine.\" In Mayoiga, nonsense passes as logic and no one questions it once. The names \"Hyouketsu no Judgeness\" and \"Jack\" are acknowledged to be 'similar'. A character claiming to be able to see dead people is accepted as a valid argument as to why another character is not in fact a ghost. Medieval forms of witch torture are used as practical assessments of guilt, with a council of thoughtful glasses-pushing intellectuals actually trying to stab a twelve-year-old girl just to check if she'll bleed or not. The offhand way in which Mayoiga spews utter nonsense without ever treating its story and world as anything other than absolutely intense and important makes what would be an absolutely attrocious plot into a phenomenal piece of entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nBut it goes past that. Mayoiga's dialogue and overblown character tropes may be fun, but what really makes the show special is that it assumes that the audience has seen at least a few B horror movies and murder-mystery plots in their day, and it uses that to violently thrash their expectations in the most viscerally unsatisfying ways imaginable. If Mayoiga was a violent gorefest it would quickly slip into the realm of incoherence, lose the appeal of its nonsense dialogue, and turn into another Another (heh). But instead, Mayoiga capitalizes on lethargy and apathy. It treats its plot twists and reveals like inqonsequential details to skim over. Instead of whipping its characters up into a frenzy, it makes the majority of them lazy, subdued, whiny, and complacent. It devotes ominous attention to cast member that are never remotely relevant. If ever there were a perfect backdrop against which to place a few under-the-radar psychos and sociopaths, it's the one that Mayoiga creates through its easily-distracted mob. When characters start going missing, large portions of the cast are more concerned with existential reasoning or even debating the spelling of said character's names than with worrying about their own or their comrade's safety. Beyond this, Mayoiga goes so far as to present some of the worst direction concievably possible, pace itself in ways that make no sense, and demonstrate a staggering penchant for anticlimax right through to the very end. It could be argued that the plot was technically 'resolved', because it was, but it is done is such a way that you're left confused and slightly baffled, wondering 'wait, what? that's it? this is a story, weren't there supposed to be dramatic stakes?' and then you can't help but chuckle at the fact that Mayoiga got you good one last time as you realize that it couldn't have been any other way.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, Mayoiga is hilarious. I laughed out loud at least two or three times an episode on average, with plenty of chuckles in between, and I'm talking about from the very first episode. This is funny stuff. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, even for what it is, it's by no means perfect. I enjoyed the show immensely, but I still wish that it had been just a little bit better at what it does. The final third of the show is noticeably less funny than the rest, with a reliance on anticlimax and executing big moments horribly taking away from some of the show's momentum. In addition, the show is composed by Okada, who has always loved her melodrama, and this becomes more and more apparent as the number of faux-emotional flashbacks intensifies until that joke has been overdone and it loses its charm. If these flashbacks and idiotic backstories had become increasingly more absurd and creative perhaps this would have worked better, but the show's best backstories are mostly the early ones so unforunately this wasn't the case. In addition, it's usually the case the truly successful comedies succeed the way they do because they manage to be engaging even when they aren't throwing out jokes simply through atmosphere/intesity/actual plot, and again unfortunately when Mayoiga isn't making you laugh, it isn't really doing anything of note. In my opinion, this is what sets something like the first season of Jojo apart from the rest of the fold--even Mayoiga--in that even when Jojo isn't being immediately absurd, it manages to breed an atmosphere of fun and excitement that keeps you interested because it feels like an adventure and not just one big joke. So yeah, this thing is flawed. But that doesn't change the fact that it's a great time, and that it's consistent enough to not give you that empty feeling of 'I want to laugh more, I'm in a humorous mood, but the show's just not quite getting there\". With the right attitude, Mayoiga delivers.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end it kinda just makes me sad to see the show getting so much hate, because it's a kind of unique and truly dedicated comedy that we see rarely-to-never in anime, and it would be cool if more people could appreciate it. After watching people explode over stuff like Konosuba (personally, I find Konosuba to be, well, kinda garbage, but to each his own) I was excited to have an airing comedy that I was also invested in and could laugh along with the rest of the community. At this point, it seems a little late for that, but it's not to late for all you smart people out there who spend your time wisely and wait until the end of the season to see reviews and decide what looks like it's worth watching. Despite what almost everyone is saying to the contrary, I firmly believe that if you go into Mayoiga expecting a comedy and a self-aware but deadpan parody that you will likely find yourself happily laughing for twelve delightful episodes. Every type of humor isn't for everyone, granted, but for what it does Mayoiga is pretty much one-of-a-kind among anime, and I think it's worth giving a shot, even if just to see if it's for you.\\n\\n\r\nIn Mayoiga-esque fashion, here's the score breakdown loaded ino the end of the review now that it's almost entirely irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\nStory-- Decidedly unique. Better than Trasformers: Dark of the Moon. No other information necessary.\\n\\n\r\nArt-- Totally fucking terrible, the CGI looks like a bad skyrim mod.\\n\\n\r\nSound-- Surprisingly competent, could even be counted against the show because it's too effective. Opening is catchy AF.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-- You either love them or you Lovepon them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-- Really the only thing worth mentioning, it's a good time, that's enough of that.\\n\\n\r\nFin.\\n\\n\r\nHail Lovepon.",

            "content": "Watching Mayoiga is like opening a surprise package and finding out it's something you so fiercely hate, thus transitioning your expectations into a decaying death. The premise itself is interesting, and there's a sense of an odd feeling of triumph at the beginning because as rarely as it comes, to see a pure original 'lost somewhere' flick is definitely something you can look forward to with excessive hype and such was the case with myself. As a matter of fact, before the spring season began, I had Mayoiga at the top of my most anticipated shows list. But Mayoiga, or rather Trainwre- I mean... TheLost Village, turns out as a complete disaster. \\n\\n\r\nMayoiga begins with a bunch of ragtags together inside a bus heading towards a peculiar place known only as the Nanaki Village. The similarity between all the people, thirty to be precise, is that each and every one of them had a traumatic past of which they were all desperate to escape from. Nanaki Village is a place that is not on the map and no one knows about it, and no one can pin-point the location of the place. Nanaki Village doesn't exist. That is until a mysterious group known as \"It's Super Genesis\" or \"ISG\" for short discovers the exact location of Nanaki Village.  Various online users who make it through layers of protection of the ISG website, take part in this tour which is branded as the \"Start Life Over\" tour where people are seeking a world free of hassle and trying to relive their lives, escaping the reality. The irony in the story lies in the fact that \"changing your lives\" is something the adults should be doing, not a group of teenagers who have barely lived.\\n\\n\r\nA whopping thirty characters could all be in theory, regarded as our protagonists. But we all know that's not bound to happen in a show which consists of just twelve episodes. And that brings us to Mitsumune, the main character in which the show mostly revolves around and has the spotlight. For one, there is nothing that separates Mitsumune from the other thousands of generic main guys there are. He is shy, pathetic and single-minded who has a positive outlook no matter what happens. He is also very disloyal, so much so that he gives up on his best friend, who also joins him on the tour by the way, for a girl he met in the tour! Looking at Mitsumune makes you wonder why would such a phony guy even join on this tour? There's a backstory to him which is just as miserly as the show itself. As I said before, the first episode starts off with the tour organizer, Dahara, stating that only the people with gifted talent could ever break through the layers of their website and join the tour, which also makes you think as to how someone as dense as Mitsumune could have done that all by himself? Mayoiga is full of contradictions such as this. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are up to no good as well. A majority of them merely exist for plot conveniences, and that includes Mitsumune at times too, and have little to no in-depth characterization. Probably a few of them worth mentioning are Masaki, the mysterious girl to whom Mitsumune falls for. She plays a big role as the show progresses, but there are little traits to her character worth explaining. She's basically used as the embodiment of the emotional trope and is a pretty one-dimensional character. Hayato who goes by the pseudonym Speedstar, is a good friend of Mitsumune's. He acts as the support for Mitsumune and helps him out whenever he is in need. Speedstar is more suited to be the show's protagonist in my opinion as he's displayed as someone who has a strong willpower and personality. He undergoes a terrible characterization later on however which was a waste. A few characters act as a sidekick like Valkana, who is shown as a very angry man. Koharun, who is the one responsible for locating the Nanaki Village and Lovepon, who is probably the craziest in my opinion. All she ever talks is about executing and is a good example of a literal cardboard-cut \"yandere\" trope character. However, there's a backstory on her which was quite captivating and displayed the struggles she goes through as a kid. It's depressing since the show doesn't do justice at all to the backstory as she's used for mere conveniences by taking on a more active role in the coming episodes saying the exact same thing over and over again. \\n\\n\r\nIt's such a shame because Mayoiga has well-designed characters for an original show. The art isn't anything significant and is nothing but generic, but it doesn't necessarily mean bad. The characters and the backgrounds are drawn simple and not too exaggerated which helps the viewers settle in very quickly. But for the most part, there is a visible decline in the art and a good example of this are the first two episodes. The pilot episode has nice visuals but there are times when it goes downhill from there in the coming episodes. The CGI effects used later on suck for the most part. One of the main reasons being the totally absurd \"Monsters\" but yet there are moments where the characters are shown alongside the CGI-designed creatures and it all feels very underwhelming. The visuals for the opening/ending songs respectively are kept very minimal where they focus on merely introducing the characters. The ending especially only uses the faces of the characters in them with different characters in the next episode ending than the previous. Overall I have to say the art is pretty mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound aspect of Mayoiga is once again a mixed bag. On one hand: Fantastic opening and ending song, A few good soundtracks in between which play by the mood and the atmosphere etc. And then there is this task of voicing over two dozens of characters. Honestly, many of the characters' voices are done terribly and seemingly by amateurs in the industry. And it comes as no surprise for an anime which was supported by crowdfunding, to have budget issues and made by a small time studio. Many of the characters are played by the newer personnel or ones with little experience in voice acting and that is so very evident in Mayoiga. \\n\\n\r\nMayoiga is at times so insane that it matches the contemporaries of those anime which are so bad that they're good. It's a common expectation that with such a huge amount of cast, many will be put off to death soon and that does seem to be happening until it takes a completely different route. It's tough to tell after a few episodes if this is truly a mystery show, psychological drama or a satirical comedy. Mayoiga doesn't rely on gore to put off the viewers and be 'edgy'. But instead it uses hysterically pretentious philosophical dialogues and awful plot twists which literally does the trick and puts off everyone watching it and can be deemed as cringe-worthy. At this point I'm just gonna say avoid Mayoiga at all costs. It's an utter waste of time and nothing good will ever come out watching it. I'd also like to mention that this is the worst anime I've ever seen.\\n",

            "content": "Mayoiga (The Lost Village) is a really strange series and to watch it, you\u2019ll really need to do it with some attention or an open mind. I can\u2019t remember the last time I watched a show with such amount of absurdity, to a point where I feel just as lost as the characters in the story. Directed by Tsutomu Mizushima (Shirobako, Girls und Panzer), the series takes the genre of mystery but what you expect isn\u2019t what you\u2019ll likely get. And in many ways, Mayoiga sends a wrong message that makes the show look like a borderline comedy.\r\nAs an original series, the premise itself soundsinteresting. Think about it. You have a group of characters each with their own personalities but all end up in the same place, a village named Nanakimura. It invites a lot of questions about what takes place and the discoveries they\u2019ll make. Those who have seen series such as Another, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, and Ghost Hound may be in for a treat. On paper, the show looks intriguing. However, the first episode gave me a mixed impression especially when it introduces 30 characters. What goes on my mind is: how on Earth do they plan to give characterization with this many people? The show is also only 1 cour so my expectations was rather dense about how much they can focus on the story as well.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially, the show is pretty much about a group of characters being lost in a remote location after being dropped off by the bus driver. The setting (Lost Village) invites a lot of attention because by plot formulaic standards, there\u2019s bound for a lot to happen. It\u2019s not strange in the sense that everyone on this trip gets lost but why they are there. And it also sets up developments related to survival, trust issues, and possibly even death. The show already establishes a few given ideas though \u2013 being that no one really knows why they\u2019re there, what\u2019s at the village, or how to get back. There\u2019s a lot of diverse personalities all mixed in at once if we take at the characters individually. Their common goal of course is to get the hell away from there as fast as possible.\\n\\n\r\nOn paper, there\u2019s 30 characters but the series does manage to show some background stories for some of the more prominent individuals. Besides Mitsumune, we also get some storytelling about Hayato (Mitsumune\u2019s best friend), Valkana (a man that is trying to build a new life from his previous job), Lovepon (a girl obsessed with execution), Nyanta (a kid with fondness with guns), the mysterious Masaki with connections with the bus driver, and among others. While their background stories doesn\u2019t have direct connections to the main story, it does identify their characteristics. And that\u2019s an important part of the show. The characters in this series needs to know who each other are to build trust. In a place of unknown, the last thing they need is betrayal or turmoil between each other. The show only does a moderate job at crafting relationships because quite honestly, there\u2019s just too many characters to work around with. In retrospect, most of the character relationships are based more on how much they want to know about each other.\\n\\n\r\nAfter seeing a fair amount of episodes, I find it hard to understand the purpose of the show. Yes, it\u2019s supposed to be a thriller but a lot of times, I find it rather amusing with the amount of superstitious events that occurs in the series. Perhaps it\u2019s surreal comedy? Who knows but some of events going on are rather unbelievable. In addition, the story feels more like a skit where the characters are there for entertainment. Their established personalities become more and more evident as each episodes ventures on. At some point, I have to wonder if it series is trying to be unintentionally funny or not. For instance, the show at one point decided to actually make Lovepon into a prominent character for the viewers to take seriously despite her behavior being borderline insane. It\u2019s definitely not scary if that\u2019s the original purpose because just how ridiculous it has been. The first two episodes actually makes the series somewhat compelling because of the way it sets everything up. However, the amount of absurdity that builds up more and more and later feels just like popcorn comedy.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the artwork isn\u2019t great, it isn\u2019t bad either. It\u2019s more like somewhere between the middle where it\u2019s acceptable. The setting does have a genuine feeling of horror with its eerie atmosphere. Character designs aren\u2019t impressive but they are fresh enough to show that each individual has some unique trait. The fun part about the show is the character expressions as we see how they react to certain situations. Lovepon is the gold standard for this while there are times when see others behave in ways that are laughable.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack on most part works for the show. It works in the way that it portrays the atmospheric setting well. The OP and ED theme songs aren\u2019t very impressive but the OST has the general idea of giving mystery vibes. Character voice mannerism actually deserves some praise especially with the female characters because of how they react. Meanwhile, the show also crafts some dramatic scenery accompanied by the choreography of intense music at times. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhat did I just watch?\u201d You\u2019ll probably ask yourself that question more times than you can count by the time this show is over. Make no mistake, Mayoiga is more about entertainment than an intriguing mystery or horror story. It has the general premise but it hardly delivers at what it tries to do. There\u2019s also a lack of sorrow felt during the show despite some key staff involved and writing. So what is Mayoiga really? Is it a show that is \u201cso bad, it\u2019s good\u201d? Well to me, it\u2019s more of a \u201cI\u2019m so lost\u201d.\\n",

            "content": "It was like watching a train wreck, so bad, however so appealing to watch that you can't look away.\r\nEscapism is a major part of the story. Each of the 30 characters want to start their lives over again because of a troubling past. Now don't get me wrong, Mayoiga had, has a very interesting concept, plot, and story however I felt like it wasn't able to execute (get the pun) important things like dramatic scenes and capturing realistic emotions very well. The story and plot felt a bit too cliche, predictable, and badly written to the point where I don't even want to go backand re-watch it. The plot for each episode undoubtedly displayed more faults than corrections. Now ordinarily when I'm watching a show, it doesn't have to be too good nor too bad. As long as a show is unique, promising, and delivers great things then I'm okay with it. Unfortunately this was just not the case with The lost village. An entire episode of Mayoiga can be slow and very unbalanced in terms of what elements to the story are being used. So at the beginning of an episode I'll notice that drama will start, then some sort of action, later horror, then back to drama, the direction certain episodes would go in were just too complex. The so called \u201chorror\u201d is unfortunately not Mayoiga's strength. If anything dramatic and bizarre conclusions to an episode would be.\\n\r\nSome episodes you expect to see certain issues & concerns resolved however they are not looked into further. Yeah, they'll show a character who drowned and another who fell off a mountain or cliff however none of that is explained any further. The other characters quickly forget about those people who appeared to have met some sort of grim fate. I understand that there was an attempt made to keep a mystery flow to the lost village however for the most Part I didn't feel like it was working out properly. \\n\\n\r\nHow the producers tried to go about it made it look & feel unnatural, as if they were trying a bit too hard... well maybe not with the setting. I'll admit fog and the woods does make for an overused, yet satisfy place for events like these to occur. With regard to the characters back stories, I really disliked how long it took for me to get a proper introduction to each of their traumatic pasts. I felt like if back-stories were introduced during the earlier episodes and not midway maybe I could establish some sort of personal connection and really get to like the characters, I'll explain further down below. Out of the very few things that I did admire about the show was that every time an episode was ending it would always end with something completely insane or bizarre that would get me excited to watch the next episode.\\n\r\nIn fact, the #1 reason why I continued to go on with this show is because of that! I love the build up! I would say that it is in fact very intense. So intense that I would just be questions to myself and with others what could we see happen on the next episode. Dialogue was another issue I had however I think I'll discuss more about this a bit later. I thought the story was alright, not the best, however it was still tolerable and decent enough to be engaging. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest disappointment with the show had to be the cast of characters. In my opinion, all the characters were too plain. Their back stories, personalities, actions, I just could not establish a connection to any of the characters and that really made tension and other moments pleasurable to me. I'm not going to get exciting when some homosexual shooting arrows at people arrives. I'm not going to freak out when every character thinks that the adorable Masaki is a ghost. 30 characters, Thirty! Each with different personalities and trauma, after the show was finished I had no favorites, no characters that I really liked, none that I could really understand it was such an unpleasant experience seeing the characters interact. A majority of the time it was like watching a bunch of clueless children. I honestly, and for the first time in quite a long time and I mean almost 2 years times, I've watched a show where I didn't like any of the characters. Moving on, I felt like a majority of the characters were effortlessly written. By that I mean it was as if the team working on each episode didn't take their time to give most characters interesting characteristics. It was like all the group did was put a bunch of index cards with personalities written in a bag, shook it, pulled one out and said \u201cOkay, we have drawn crazy\u201d lets add a crazy personality to Love-pon, that's all. Each character acts according to certain archetype like dandere for Lion, or Nanko, nadeshiko for Masaki, genki for Nyanta etc. Characters did have the potential to be greater however. From what I saw, their actions, interactions, developments, I was not too impressed. I do not think it is possible for me to come back to this show just to see certain characters or relive special moments.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was really good. The special effects used to represent some characters fears or traumatizing life experiences looked both hilarious and amazing to a certain degree. I did notice that there were some animation problems, in particular I mean the moment in one episode where there are two Koharun's visible. Character designs were certainly interesting too. I admired the fact that no two characters looked alike. The animators made great use of CGI and 3D for silicone boob monster and other various things (I actually couldn't tell because that sort of animation was used during night settings.) Background settings looked pretty nice. I mentioned earlier that the main setting, fog, woods, mountains, etc(although cliche) works well with the stories plot because what better place to get away from all your troubles and start over again than an abandoned village out in the middle of boonies.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part I liked the soundtrack. The background music, the dramatic music worked pretty well when something strange, dramatic, or supernatural was occurring. The sound sort of helped add fear to the already hilarious joke of a \u201chorror\u201d show however, as stated earlier, they tried too hard. Music was quickly drowned out by the exaggerated screams and yells of characters in fear. Rule opening & ED songs were pretty great! I had no issues with Em' Sound effects held up pretty well, and everything else in general was good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAt times however the biggest enjoyment comes from the well executed (PUNS PUNS PUNS!!!) plot twist/bizarre endings of each episode. In all honesty, that was the biggest reason I had to finish this show. The directors knew, they knew that they were going to have a difficult time keeping things interesting for fans, so they purposely added the bizarre endings and twist just to keep fans like me coming back every week, Clever bastards. That aside, I don't really don't think this was Mari Okada best work compared to other projects she's worked on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Mayoiga has its issues and it just didn't have the lasting appealing for me. I won't think to myself a year later \u201cHmmm what was the name of that show where a bunch of people go on a crazy start life all over again trip?\u201d",

            "content": "The Lost Village is a rather unique show. Featuring a large cast of thirty named characters, acclaimed director Tsumotu Mizushima (Shirobako, Girls und Panzer, Dai Mahou Touge) and a similarly acclaimed writer Mari Okada (Ano Hana, Toradora, Nagi no Asakura); to call The Lost Village ambitious would be an understatement. In this review I intend to explain what makes The Lost Village brilliant whilst also explaining what makes this show as polarizing as it appears to be.\r\nThe Lost Village presents itself as a horror show. A bunch of kids and young adults board a bus to a mysterious village in order to rebuild their lives.On the way large there are constant references to suicide, cannibalism, and torture. An incredibly generic thriller horror opening. Typically this kind of show with a large initial cast fall into that brand of horror where most of the cast is 'spent' in either a gorey or a psychologically unnerving manner. That would normally be what draws people to the show initially, for example Higurashi. At the start of the season that is very much what I expected from The Lost Village: an over the top horror show with some incredibly silly deaths, basically Another. I couldn't have been more wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe Lost Village is a comedy show. It is a comedy show set in an amateur studentish horror show. Most anime comedy revolves around overt gags. You have a show, be it a comedy show or merely a show that utilizes a comedy, and in it a joke is presented to you. The joke is then commented on by the cast, usually a 'straight-man character'. Obviously this varies, from Key adaptation's very single skit focussed approaches to comedy, to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's approach of having ridiculous things be ridiculous but playing it entirely straight within the show itself. However, none of these is how The Lost Village approaches comedy. The humour in The Lost Village is instead more meta-structural. Playing with genre or anime-in-general expectations by 'looking' at the 'correct way' of doing things and then doing the opposite. \\n\\n\r\nAll thirty-something characters are all one dimensional flat characters with maybe one or two traits to each of them. You have the meowing gun fan, the earnest execution lover, that incredibly thirsty boy, and that's a joke. In a lesser show this would be atrocious. An entire cast of unlikable bland characters.  Yet the show constantly draws attention to not only how ridiculous the cast is, but also how genuine the cast is. That meowing gun lover will always be meowing, always will be in love with guns, and that is just their character. No tragic backstory, even when brought up, will explain that away like a traditional horror thriller would. The meowing gun fan isn't meowing because she was bullied as a kid, nor is the execution lover into execution as some form of vengeance over abuse.  Instead, The Lost Village's tragic backstories exist merely to poke fun at tragic backstories. To poke fun at itself, and to bring genuine laughter to it's audience.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost everything in the show revolves around taking it's horror thrilling premise and ruining it. Any tense moment will be butchered by traditionally bad shot composition. All movement in a scene being off camera, the focus of a scene being completely absent and the 180 degree rule being ignored, or just putting props in the way of the character talking for the sheer purpose of taking all tension that 'should' be in the scene away. Or perhaps, instead of using bad shot composition, what will ruin a scene is the cast just getting bored. Rather than grouping together, or splitting up in order to find the plot the vast majority of the time the cast state that they should be doing that and then immediately get bored and distracted. The show is completely consistent in it's contrivances. It's running jokes continue running and even reach climactic highs as the cast accidentally run across and have Plot happen to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe Plot in The Lost Village is a Plot of nothingness. Since it takes so long for the cast to actually 'get' anywhere what could typically have been a hamfisted appreciation of trauma instead takes an entire season to get going and then get's 'resolved' in bored characters speaking verbal shitposts at each other. These conversations about nothing, or about something important before getting distracted account for around half of all that happens in the show. It's ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nYet, even with all this ridiculous nothingness going on, The Lost Village has some genuine moments. These genuine moments, whilst laughed at in some form of another most, but not all, of the time, are well done. A character dealing with or coming to terms with their trauma is not laughed at. The traumas that the Plot of the show explores are not the jokes in and of themselves. The Lost Village cares deeply for it's cast of sometimes absurd archetypes, and sometimes oddly genuine people. In caring for them it cares deeply for it's audience. Genuine struggles are treated genuinely. There's no gratuitous abuse, and the only violence that's a joke in and of itself tends to revolve around The Big Bads being CG and terrible.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be easy to look at what The Lost Village does and compare it to check lists of good and bad writing and decide it is definitely of the former. But to consider the show bad because of this would be doing it a disservice. The Lost Village takes traditionally bad writing and direction and instead makes it good. The Lost Village uses the implicit 'joke' in stuff like The Room or Birdemic and makes it explicit. If you buy into the inconsistent consistency of it's premise The Lost Village is a precious show. An unmissable and unique experience. However, such an experience may be hard to get into, for by using traditionally bad techniques can be a major turn off making it impossible for one to get immersed in the fun.",

Most of them are fucking annoying, make me want to punch my computer's screen hoping my fist would break through dimension knock them the fuck out. God, fucking Lovepon and her EXECUTION! \r\nThis anime do a poor making me care about any of the characters. These characters are all losers who want to escape their lives because they fucking suck. We slowly learn how lamethey are and then we got their weird fucking trauma manifest as creepy fucking shit. One of them got silicon as his trauma monster because he got one implant inside his head to make him taller, fucking lol. I kid you not.\\n\\n\r\nEach episodes make you question the characters capability to use their brains because nothing they do make fucking sense. If you expect any good explaination for everything that's going in the series, you won't. I mean they explains it but its garbage. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I regret watching this anime. I never give an anime such a low score but this anime deserve all of it. Fucking garbage.",

            "content": "Anime may not be able to walk on your behalf but can make someone surprised by something unexpected. Yes, this is Mayoiga. I was quite excited to make a review about this anime, please read slowly and this is my view objectively. WARNING : MAY CONTAIN SPOILER.\r\nWhat's the first time I say? It can\u2019t be believed! Well, it may sound like an exaggeration but this is the real situation. When you see this anime, you look, you see the synopsis or watch the preview. Moreover with mystery, predictable, nor may you and me, must have been quite challenged and put it into your watch list.With Another or Higurashi who\u2019s capable of attracting the attention of many people. You put this anime with very high expectations.\\n\\n\r\nI'll first start of the story, the story is the main problem of this anime. Telling about the village are missing, we could see some early episodes was the introduction stage about situations and characters. My first assumption is development is quite slow, probably rather too wordy. But increasingly there began to emerge a variety of issues and a few episodes, I still wondering about my confusion on this anime. Will be brought where the story? Very boring. That's wrong here, me, and (perhaps) we were all wrong with expecting a creepy story, tense or foster a sense of excitement, as we watch anime \"Another\". So my first assumption didn\u2019t last long, when I tried to watch closely and be careful. My second assumption is \u201cmy decision was wrong\u201d. This anime wants to make the audience follow their progress slowly, not rush. I realize that this anime producer successfully twist my mind and finally presented things that \u201csped away\u201d from my estimation. It turns out the story is not that simple packaging.\\n\\n\r\nBut I can\u2019t dismiss that progress is slow, I was a bit annoyed they\u2019re always debating things that are not necessary. But instead of all the events that happened, there is a debate and misunderstanding that leads us to understand their characters. Very obvious, with the disappearance of their friend, they don\u2019t understand each other and the things they didn\u2019t expect to happen, it makes them depressed and inner conflict begins. Finally, we can understand their character. And their characters were, unwittingly, is key to the root of the problems they face and the secret behind the Nanaki village. Honestly, I was a little regret not trying to enjoy the plot. Because my mind might have considered ugly about this anime. But I take that back. Merger of drama-mystery is very nice! Remember the first time they\u2019re in the bus and do a self-introduction? They reason aren\u2019t much different, essentially those who follow the tour wasn\u2019t just avid fans of mystery, but they really try to live a new life and escape from their past. This reminds me of Aoi Bungaku, from taking place setting, story and atmosphere are different. But the point is the same, telling us about the issues facing them and when they tried to escape and live a new life. Fear and regret haunt wherever they go. Curiosity will be answered little by little in each episode, the lost village, traditional songs, this is the mystery. Not a ghost or anything physical shock. Story : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNext, there is no need comment about the art, coloring or effect. The characters is described very cute, and quite creepy monster! Especially of monsters who\u2019s attacking lovepyon, if I pay attention, movement feels real. Well, I actually really like, and I think there is no problem about this. Because, basically every anime has a different style. Picture: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThird, talk about sound, I think the opening and closing songs are good. Instrumental and lyrics are very supportive. The opening song reminds me a little bit with Subete F ga ni naru, compared to show something creepy, but the depiction of the characters themselves. Real despair. Sound : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, is bad? No. They played very well at all. Because so many of the characters in this anime, initially quite hard to remember their names apart before they call each other names. Can be seen, so many characters with diverse characters. There are like prostitutes, taciturn, grumpy, and so forth. But perhaps of all the characters are quite caught my attention was lovepyon and not the protagonist, mitsumune. She is very sweet, but with a different physical nature,she is creepy and autism. Always talk about the execution, execution and execution. Fortunately their acting and actions unsatisfactory, if not, I would feel bored with the progress of the story is fairly slow. This is the appeal of this anime, their character. Their characters feel real and make it more alive. Characters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs of my exposition above, my view of this anime is not bad, but I\u2019m quite satisfied. Progress was slow, made sense of curiosity, and others. Let me emphasize here that try to enjoy and feel the sensation. Although the mystery was not outstanding but still make us curious. Enjoyment : 9/10",

            "content": "Welcome to \"so bad it's actually funny\" \u2013 the anime. Sort of.\r\nIt's hard to explain just how bad Mayoiga actually is without seeing it with your own eyes, but if I were to use one word to describe it then it'd be \"amateurish\". It feels like both the scriptwriting and the directing were done by a group of 14-year-olds for some school film project or something. It's like one of those second-rate western horror flicks that you solely watch for shits and giggles, except put in an anime format for even greater effect. You might be familiar with the 2012 anime \"Another\": it was ananime which was supposed to be a horror/mystery show yet it became more known for being an unintentional comedy due to how hilariously bad it was at creating suspense and because of how stupid its death scenes were. Guess what; Mayoiga and Another share the same director... and as a result Mayoiga is basically the same deal all over again, though with a lot less casualties in it this time. Actually that's not entirely fair; Mayoiga is even worse.\\n\\n\r\nWithin the first 5 minutes of the very first episode, we're introduced to *30* new characters, all with their own self-introductions. I have seriously never seen an anime before which overwhelms you to such an extent right from the start with so many new names to learn. How is anyone supposed to remember them all? Long story short, you won't. Don't even try. And besides, as you'll find out, the characters are all terrible anyway so spare yourself the effort.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the story starts out with a bus filled with 30 unfamiliar people bound for a mysterious rural settlement called \"Nanaki Village\", a place which supposedly cannot be found on any map for unknown reasons. The purpose of the trip is supposedly for all the passengers to start over with new lives for themselves due to their respective personal circumstances. After some troubles, they arrive at the village only to find out that it's abandoned, and soon enough strange things start happening around them. Some people disappear whilst exploring the village, and mysterious claw marks dripping with blood are found in the forest. This all has the setup for an obvious horror story where people will get killed from the shadows or something along those lines, which would have been the obvious solution to the problem of the overwhelming size of the character cast: I.E: by killing off the majority of them. But strangely enough that's not what happens.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, Mayoiga descends down a spiral of \"wtf am I watching\" as the characters first turn on each other only to then keep changing their minds on who's guilty of what every 2 minutes, and absurd supernatural events seemingly start to occur with \"monsters\" straight out of Disneyland appearing everywhere. It's one big scrambled mess which barely makes any sense, but above all it's completely impossible to take seriously. I find it hard to believe that you're really supposed to be scared or intrigued by this, because the only thing it ever makes you do is laugh out loud at how unbelievably stupid and nonsensical the things that are happening are. And while the story admittedly does start to make sense towards the end, at that point you don't even care anymore.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes Mayoiga stand out though is the character cast itself. I don't really know how to put this other than that it's absolutely *horrible*. Like record levels of awful. I've already mentioned the huge problem of it being impossible to remember the names of more than a handful of them, but on top of that not a single one of them is likable. At all. They all behave like complete and utter retards from start to finish, blatantly changing their opinions whenever someone else brings up any new piece of information, they all have needlessly clich\u00e9 and bland backstories which you don't even want to hear in the first place, and they're just plain annoying to watch. They're completely incapable of handling the situation they find themselves in and they act paranoid beyond belief for almost no reason. I guess you could argue that a group of people who think that running away from society by joining some shady bus trip to a rural village probably aren't the smartest people to begin with, but still. That sounds more like a bad excuse than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC is a weak, gullible boy called Mitsumune who feels like the most unsuitable person imaginable to be the protagonist of a horror/mystery show, and he just ends up coming off as annoying more often than not. Worst of all though, there's this one psychopathic girl called Lovepon who does nothing but desperately yell the word \"Execute!\" at any given moment, and is one of the most obnoxious characters I've ever seen. She reminds me of Nina Einstein from Code Geass a lot (protip: that's not a good thing). She wants to kill everyone for the slightest suspicious move, yet everyone else seems to trust her instincts completely above anyone else who says otherwise. Like really? Can't you like\u2026 see that this girl is completely mentally unstable? Why are you going along with her as if she's reliable or something? I seriously don't get it. Who's more stupid: the idiot or the people who actually believe in her? In any case the entire cast are basically cardboard cutouts of various common anime tropes, with their specific traits cranked up to the max but their IQ dragged down to under 50. There is absolutely nothing to make the viewers feel any sympathy or connection to them, and as a result you just end up not caring about what happens to them. There is basically no depth or character development at all. Yes, we get a lot of tragic backstories from them spoon-fed to us, but those are all so incredibly bland and generic that it doesn't actually help their cause much to speak of. Rather it just ends up feeling like a waste of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nSo as far as being a horror/mystery goes, Mayoiga is in my mind one of the worst anime ever made. However, there is one saving grace for this show, albeit an unintentional one. And that is quite simply that it's actually pretty funny. Sure it's for all the wrong reasons, but either way the sheer amount of stupidity in the scriptwriting results in some comedic genius. The characters consistently do the most idiotic things that will catch you off guard and just make you laugh at how dumb they are. And don't even get me started on the so-called \"horror\" elements of this show. Just... just see for yourselves and you'll see what I mean; they look so ridiculously dumb it's hilarious. And because of that, the actual entertainment value of this anime is actually decent despite it being awful in basically all other categories, hence why I'm still generous enough to give it a 4 in the end. As for whether being \"so bad it's funny\" is enough of a motivation to actually watch the show though... well that probably just comes down to your sense of humor. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. Only one way to find out. Mayoiga is not an anime you laugh with. It's an anime you laugh at.",

This anime obviously made a lot of people disappointed, but just because it was able to do that was I able to enjoy it even more than I already had. This anime was tagged as Mystery and for the entirety of it I was just left wondering at awe in every episode. Even though the flow of the story was bad and it could've gone way better, I was able to enjoy this anime because of how crazy it is and how people are getting frustrated over it.\r\nStory(6)\r\nYeah the story is pretty bland and the flow is abit horrible but it's certainly not mediocre because it is pretty damn unique.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8)\\n\r\nThe visuals were great and the monsters/Nanaki were just awesomely creepy.\\n\\n\r\nSound(8)\\n\r\nThe audio was pretty great actually. I really like the ED song. Oh, and of course how could I forget Koharun's eerie song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(7)\\n\r\nIt's good. Not great, but good. Each had their own unique crazy personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10)\\n\r\nIt was like riding a roller-coaster 'nuff said.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(8)\\n\r\nI don't understand why people are giving it a lot of hate. It's certainly cut from a different cloth, that much I can say. I won't be able to see an anime as crazy as this one for a long while and I'm glad because I myself might also become even crazier if I keep watching more anime like this. It's a pretty great anime and it's definitely not for sane people.",

The story about being lost at a certain village with bunch of people who has psychological scars piqued my interest. Most people had dropped this because there are quite a few who had written some bad comments about this particular anime (DON'T JUST JUMP INTO THE BANDWAGON). But why won't you give this a shot. It's only worth 12 episodes, the art is not bad and the music is outstanding. This is not everyone'scup of tea but why don't you give this a watch and judge this for yourself. My only issue about this anime is that it contains a lot of characters and because of that, some characters were not executed properly and the ending could have been better. This should've been longer because the theme was really good and the characters were really interesting. This should've been longer to execute the plot more properly. This should've been longer for the characters to develop more. This anime should've been a bit longer. It's very promising, the art is great, the soundtrack is great, and the characters are interesting. All I see is an anime full of potential and it should've been a bit longer.",

The characters as I recall are listed like this: Harem Gay, Harem Gay's Best Friend, Love Interest (sometimes Bow Girl), Pikachu, Uzi Chick, Military Guy, Pirate Jack, Other Jack, Larry (refer to Phoenix Wright), Execute Girl, Soy Latte (actual name), Small Beard, and Black Dude. There are a ton of other people, but no one cares. This show damned itself by having such a largecast in such a small show. There were attempts to make us relate to and like this enormous cast. Unfortunately, you cannot have character development or character-viewer relations built between so many people as quickly as they tried to make this happen. They failed at both jobs. \\n\\n\r\nHow are all these interesting people together in the same place? They took the bus to a village where they wanted to make a commune of dysfunctional kids. This village is something something Nanaki something something ghosts from your past something something giant tit. Yes, a literal giant tit haunted Military Guy. He is not the only guy with a stupid background and a stupid spirit/inner demon. Our resident hard-ass Small Beard is terrified of Thomas the Tank Engine with googly eyes because he was laughed during work because his failed plans. The giant penguin and Horde mount are debatably the most legitimate inner fears. The sheer amount of stupid ideas made me feel like a brain surgeon was giving me a noogie with grip tape. It hurts. \\n\\n\r\nThe only hope for the show after episode 2/3 was to go full slasher flick. Cheesy slasher flicks are easy to execute and no one expects a good twist at the end. Instead Black Dude isn't actually dead. He was talking to a guy he called God who was a researcher on the village because he was interested in bullshit. He could have studied manure and accomplish more than what he did. \\n\\n\r\nIn the very end after everyone made peace with their inner demons and after one of the kids have to say that it is some random chick that was the bad guy all along, because they didn't specify that well enough, they sang a song called the Unlucky Hippopotamus. That is what every unfortunate viewer of the show is. An Unlucky Hippopotamus. Congrats.\\n",

If MAL offered negative scores, I may have spitefully given it a -2 rather than a positive one.\r\nI trudged through all twelve episodes, wasting 22 minutes of my life every week hoping that somehow, the plot would actually slowly turn good, and the characters wouldn't be so goddamn obnoxious. Didn't happen. I'm asking God for a refund of those minutes after I die one day.\r\nFirst off: Why the everloving frick would you have 30 characters in a show that's only twelve episodes?! With so little time to develop anyone as a character, it'sa wonder that they even thought that that was a good idea. Honestly, over 2/3 the cast could've been tossed away and nothing from the show would've changed. It was an unnecessary waste and barely anyone was given decent character development. In so-called horror/mystery shows such as this, it is crucial to have characters that the audience can root for or relate to. No such thing here. By the time episode 2-3 finished  practically everyone watching was hoping that the whole cast would just die. Not to mention, the characters who are presented more often are meh at best and fucking annoying at worst. They're all one-trick ponies who have one defining trait and nothing else explored about them. They have \"\"backstories\"\", but those are just another bad attempt at trying to get the viewer to sympathize for them (one was bullied, one tried to get into the military and failed, one did something wrong on a business deal, one was abused by a stepfather, etc.) and though you may feel bad for them a bit, it doesn't change the fact that most of them are useless and annoying characters. There are points where you may think that certain people got character development, and then, BAM! They reverted back to the way they were. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \\n\\n\r\nI'd talk about a story if there actually was one. Every time there's a mystery, there's always a crappy, half-assed explanation, followed by another mystery that is inevitably going to end up with the same crappy half-assed explanation by the next episode. At the series' end, there were still many questions left unanswered. The characters themselves are so annoying that it's actually hard to focus on the story (or on whether the story is actually there or not). \\n\\n\r\nThe art is the best part of the series. It's not too bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP/ED were nice to listen to, but they're easily skippable. I didn't really pay attention to the sound in the series otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: unless you are fond of subjecting yourself to torture in all sorts of forms, don't watch this show. it's a waste of your time.",

            "content": "Many people within the anime community complain about the degrading quality of modern anime works.  Though I always try to view anime in a positive light, I can't deny that Mayoiga is a great example of this. I mean it was so mediocre and pretentious and it just fell into an eternal abyss of dissapointment. \r\nThe lost village is the type of show that tries several ideas and concepts but fails miserably at several of these endeavors. It desperately attempts to incorporate deep themes but can hardly get down dynamic characterization and development, not to mention a completely muddled narrative.\r\n The story ofMayoiga follows thirty young individuals who are going to a village to escape all of their problems. This is an incredibly promising concept which could have been amazing if it was handled and developed properly. However a main issue is that a core story doesn't really appear until midway through the entire series. This leads to much confusion throughout the entire series because even after a narrative is established it doesn't take long for it to completely fall apart. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters of Mayoiga had great potential. The character of mitsumune had an interesting backstory and some valid motivation. However he is a really annoying and bland character and he hardly grows throughout the story. Masaki is kind of the standard timid quiet innocent girl that is very generic. Koharun was also pretty bland but there was a good plot twist involving her. Hayato was probably the best and most interesting character and his motives were very relatable. \\n\\n\r\nThe other side characters in Mayoiga is the perfect example of a large amount of characters who don't mean crap to the viewer. Honestly just info dumping their backstories at random is not a good way to develop a character. Their were a couple of semi-interesting side characters but the rest were just hit garbage. The cast was way too big and it really hindered the potential of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes of accepting your psychological scars is explored through characters I can hard,y care about. This makes the anime very pretentious due to it trying to be deep but failing miserably. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of Mayoiga is actually good. There is a feel of modern polish and I had no problem with it. The voice acting was also good and the actors portrayed their respective characters accurately. The music was excellent with a great opening and ending themes. The ost also built good atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Mayoiga is a series that had an amazing amount of potential in its premise but just completely flopped. It has some redeemable aspects but there are much better less pretentious mystery anime out there so I can't reccomened this anime.",

            "content": "Hey, are you looking for a well made mystery anime that boasts a suspenseful plot with intriguing characters? Then DON'T watch Mayoiga! This show failed miserably to be the good mystery anime that it tried so hard to be. Mayoiga got consistently worse and more agrivating to watch as each episode passed by. In fact, it almost drove me to take a bus tour to an abandoned town divode of life and technology myself just so that I wouldn't have to watch this disgrace on my PC every week.\r\nPlot: 1/10\r\nWith an intriguing (albeit kinda stupid) premise, I figured that the overall story would at leastbe somewhat interesting. However, since episode one the plot practically disappeared in a similar way to how some of the characters in this show vanished. And by that I mean in a vague and unexplained manner. The writers just seemed to disregard whatever plot elements they had in mind to specifically focus on the stupidity of the characters. The story doesn't go anywhere due to the singular focus on the idiotic decisions made by the anime's cast. Mayoiga unintentionally transferred from a mystery to a comedy. I won't go into detail on this point, but if you watch the anime, you'll understand where I'm coming from. The writing in this show is absolutely horrid.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite basic. The majority of the characters each have their own original design, although they're animated in a rather simplistic manner. There's not much to say about the scenery, which is also kind of underwhelming. My main issue has to be the cgi monsters that appear. They're so poorly designed that I couldn't help but chuckle a bit when I first saw them. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme song is rather average and isn't anything special. The ending is mediocre and skippable. The background soundtrack helps keep the mood tense and edgy during suspenseful scenes- oh wait, there aren't any in this anime! The voice acting is average and bland, and I really don't like the main characters voice. It's rather annoying. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you ever decide to create a twelve episode long anime, never, under any circumstances, have a cast of over thirty characters. That's right, the geniuses who created Mayoiga thought that they'd be able to effectively develop OVER THIRTY CHARACTERS in just TWELVE EPISODES. As you can imagine, the majority of the characters don't even have a personality, much less any development. Practically all of the characters are so stupid that I almost want to smash my head through a concrete tablet when I watch them. They're so disorganized, paranoid, and have no idea how to deal with the undesirable situations that they find themselves in. Then again, what else can you expect from a bunch of ignoramuses who want to escape society by taking a sketchy bus tour to an uncharted town that has a very probable chance of not even existing. Oh, and instead of developing as characters as the anime progressed, the doofuses in this show somehow manage to get even stupider and more annoying with each passing episode. Now that's an accomplishment!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I had hopes that Mayorga would be able to keep me entertained, my expectations were shattered almost immediately. By the latter half of the anime I even started cringing every time a character said something stupid, which was approximately every time they opened their mouths. While I was initially intrigued with this show due to the mysterious aspects of Mayoiga, I later found myself laughing at scenes that I assume were meant to be \"unnerving\" or \"scary\" due to Mayoiga's poor execution mixed with its abysmal cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was very clear from the beginning that Mayoiga had the makings of a flawed anime. Nonetheless, I held on to the hope that it would be able to find some success. Unfortunately, the show just got worse and worse with each passing episode until it reached a point where it actually became painful to watch. Overall, Mayoiga is simply a very poorly constructed show that failed to deliver.",

            "content": "I went into this anime with the expectation that it would have a very Danganronpa-esque feel, minus the hope versus despair struggle. As it turns out, I was wrong because I kept hoping it would get better as the show went on and was met instead with disappointment and despair that a show as bland as Mayoiga wasn't canceled by the third episode.\r\nAll this poorly structured show has to offer is four and a half hours of content so boring that it will make watching paint dry a thrill by comparison.\r\nIronically, despite not killing even one of the thirty characters first introduced, this anime managedto be lifeless all the way to the very end. I couldn't bring myself to care about a single person introduced except the bus driver. I could barely remember more than three of the characters' names, and most of that is only due to the fact that they were being constantly shouted throughout the episodes. Because Mayoiga failed to point out just one or two protagonists, much of the screentime that could've helped develop stronger viewer connections was wasted on scenes with minor characters that truly didn't contribute to the story whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this is certainly not the first anime to have characters that suffer from same-face syndrome, it didn't help that everyone also reacted to every situation in one of two ways: unnecessary anger or complete calm. Occasionally, they would act finnicky and contradict themselves to progress the story. Eventually, these responses were so predictable that I found myself struggling to keep my eyes open, even as the characters faced perilous situations because, morality considered, I simply didn't care what happened to them. This apathy towards the enormous cast is mainly attributed to having way too many characters thrown at the viewer within the first few minutes and on top of that, attaching meaningless nicknames to every single one and switching between those and their real names for most of the series. Two's company, three's a crowd, and Mayoiga is a trainwreck. I wish it were a bus wreck so that maybe half of the cast could've been taken out and this anime would have a chance of being kind of okay.\\n\\n\r\nWhile mysteries can be criticized for many things, the one thing they ought not be lacking in is intrigue. Viewers should be captivated by the story and anticipate answers to the questions posed by a mystery show and yet, each of the alluring ideas posed in the first episode were met with pretty understimulating explanations. These unsatisfying shortcomings sprinkled into the disorganized plotline were widely responsible for the decline of interest in the engimas that remained. There were far too many useless diversions to the main mystery at inopportune times which may have intended to build suspense but backfired horribly. A few of the characters' tragic backstories were developed which, one would hope, usually helps viewers relate. (Spoiler alert: it didn't work.) The others were thrown under the bus (not literally, but I crossed my fingers for this a lot) although perhaps this is a blessing because I would likely find the insides of my eyelids more interesting. Ultimately, if I don't care about a character, I'm not going to care about their past, no matter how traumatic you attempt to convince me it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe final episode left me just as disillusioned as I always am after staring at Mayoiga for 24-ish minutes and asking myself when I became such a masochist. The conclusion fell flat and truly, I'm not mad... I'm just disappointed. The unveiling of the antagonist's motive for pulling the strings behind the scenes was sketchy at best, as it didn't really explain most of their actions or how they could've pulled off what they did. A lot of loose ends were left untied and surprise, surprise, the climax of the story was so underwhelming I think I'll never have to take Zzzquil to go to sleep again. \\n\\n\r\nTldr; \"The Lost Village\" should be changed to \"The Lost Interest.\" I've yawned so much watching this series that I'm going to join Evanescence so someone can wake me up inside. Don't waste your time.",

            "content": "I have seen bad anime and good anime come and go, but whenever a good anime is presented I am either disappointed or frustrated with the bandwagons attached to it. Luckily, Mayoiga is not one of these anime. Originally I gave Mayoiga a 1, but after removing parts of my ego there are some parts that make Mayoiga a bit more than a pathetic anime. This review will have no spoilers and the purpose is to convince you to rewatch or begin to watch Mayoiga.\r\nStory: \r\nMayoiga is about a group of isolationists that decide to move into a village so that they can restart theirlives. Immediately we understand that this anime is about exiles and we discover why they are exiles exactly because none of them are memorable. The main hook of this anime is the mystery of the village. The romance isn't the strong suit and when the mystery is revealed I have a hard time understanding what is real and what is not real. Story is not the strong suit by far, but what makes it better than dreadful (2) is that it has a narrative in mind and does not forget important plot points to our main character's trauma. Despite this, you will often find that a large cast of characters would be difficult to work with in 12 episodes. (3)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt is always a debatable category. I thought it was fine because it shows the defining characteristic of each character. When the art does not do this, it portrays average characters in a less than average story. Does this sound familiar? Mayoiga fits the horror-genre archetype! Since I do not want to reveal and spoilers, I will say that the CG at this time was terrifying and it fits perfectly with the mystery of the village. (6)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI liked the opening and ending... only if they were for a different show. I find that the upbeat and sad nature of these songs do not define the show and although it serves to hype me for the next episode it does not hype me for the story or characters. The overall soundtrack has a bunch of ambiance that seems offsetting, yet it somehow fits when understanding what a train wreck this anime really is. The best song you will hear, however, is the hippopotamus song. (3)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime are generic and flat. I wasn't rooting for any of the characters except 2 of them: the female tour guide and the bus driver. The only thing to keep in mind is that literally all of these people are isolationists. We often define each of these characters for a trait that society deems immoral like we have a character that enjoys executions and another that enjoys killing. Those are the extreme examples, but some other examples are also beauty and unemployment. There are so many different people here that I could not tell what the point of Mayogia really was. (1)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI don't count my enjoyment to the overall score but I will say that I was enjoyed enough to finish the 12 episode run. I never felt like sleeping through the show at any given point and I think its best to treat this show as a comedy rather than an actual mystery. (5)\\n\\n\r\nIf you have time in your hands before the next season starts than I recommend checking out Mayoiga to pass the time. Just know that you will gain minor enjoyment and a loss of time.",

There is no gore, no murders, no blood, ghosts or epic battle scenes. What this anime does deliver though is monsters, mysteries and cliffhanger moments by the bucket load.\r\nStory in a nutshell: A large group of unrelated & dysfunctional people disenchanted with society run away together to start their lives anew in a mysterious village which exists on no mainstream maps. The village is full of mysteries and it isnot long before people start to get tormented by monsters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI found this anime challenging to rate because while petty bad, it is not awful at everything it does. And the thing it does best is mystery. That even as dysfunctional as the anime is (poor pacing, a myriad of useless characters etc), it often keeps you just hooked enough to continue baring with it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Good story with so much potential and creativity but very let down by poor pacing, illogical character interaction and poor character design (and too many characters in general). \\n\r\nMysteries abound in this anime but unfortunately so too does disappointment.  \\n",

            "content": "There is a TL;DR at the end. Just a little intro to my review, I have to say I really enjoyed this series. I was not expecting much from it since it was original content and nothing had been said about it before. I think that as an anime series it did a great job and was also completely different from everything else we have been seeing for the past few season. Also if you are a little lazy you can just read the Overall.\r\nStory: The story is about 30 men and women, some younger and some older, who go to an unmarked village toescape reality. It's very vague. And the show likes to keep it's entire story vague. For the mystery genre it works quite well since we are always second guessing ourselves and trying to play detective, but it also does have some faults. Until the very last episodes you don't have a clue what is going on, at least not for sure. And as you desperately search for answers you get more questions. While this can be also a strong point, it retains a sense of mystery to everything, I think that it to many viewers can be a weakness. People may not understand what is going on in terms of plot so they just label it as bad and move on. While I think that the bigger story of what happens in this village is quite good, I think that it would have been better if it could have been a 13 or 24 episode series as I feel that it needed more time to bring the story justice. That being said most of the characters had their own stories. In many episodes you see glimpses to the past that show how they got to this point and why they ran away. I wish that we could have seen it with more characters and I think that it being a longer series would have helped with that.\\n\r\nStory: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt: Each of the characters in the series had their own unique look, so even if you didn't remember their name (although some of them were quite memorable such as  Assbound, I mean Hyouketsu no Judgeness,) you will remember them by how they look. The setting was an abandoned village in the middle of a forest, so there was plenty of opportunity for beautiful artwork. In my opinion, they took it. The building had a great look that combined the old and abandoned with still usable. SOMEWHAT SPOILERS AHEAD: The \"monsters\" (because I don't want to spoil too much) also have a weird and interesting art style devoted to them. And yes scary. Some of them are just not as scary by nature, but one of them... I couldn't sleep after them. (Spoiler: It's the boob monster.) SOMEWHAT SPOILERS ENDED. Also a particular scene in with the starry sky was just done so beautifully, you could see each little star, and even though nighttime in the series is usually dark and dangerous, in this scene if was a serene setting that really let it become something touching.\\n\r\nArt: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound: I think that both the opening and ending were very good songs that complimented the series, but that's not all the sounds that the anime had to offer. Throughout the series music was used, whether it be from the hippopotamus song to the gentle theme that reoccurs. In both cases I think that the music added to the series instead of distracting or taking away from it. I have to admit though sometime's when Koharun sings it seemed a little sudden, although it did have a very creepy vibe, I'll give it that.\\n\r\nSound: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This show has thirty characters. I repeat this show has thirty characters. Every single one of them has a personality. While other characters are introduced throughout the series, I'm focusing on just the thirty that come into the village. Many times there is an anime that has a couple main characters and then several supporting characters, the supporting characters are shoved to the side and receive no personality. Even if the amount of screen time for the characters can sometimes be small, each one of them has a different personality and way they act. Even in the background these characters remain consistent. That being said there is character development and growth. The most obvious one being Mitsumune, even though he still has that naivety and weakness to him, he becomes much more than that. I thought that he was a wimp at the beginning of the series but by the end he had my respect. The other characters have their moments as well, but I feel like too much details would give away spoilers.\\n\r\nCharacters: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I'm giving this a ten for enjoyment, because I enjoyed this series so much. I came expecting a good series, but had no clue really what it would be. Horror mystery murder? I wasn't sure. This series made me want to find out though, I waited, not so patiently, to be able to watch each episode and each time I did I was rewarded with something that I loved and was curious about. I wish that the anime had more than twelve episodes for this reason, at first it developed very slowly, giving you things to question and to wonder about, but never giving you enough answers to be able to fully grasp what was actually happening. I think that was a strength of the show. If anyone checked out the reddit thread for Mayoiga you will see countless confused people making theories, believing the more implausible ones because the nature of this show says regular logic won't work. The show makes the viewer curious, want more, and really wonder what the show is about. I think that made the show great, and for me enjoyable.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I liked this series so much, and while I don't know if I can really recommend this to others, if you happen upon this series and are curious about it I highly recommend it. If it were just up to my personal opinion I would have given it a 9/10, but I'm not. I'm doing this because I'm trying to see it a little more objectively than I just love it. There were definitely some flaws to the series, but I think they can be overlooked once you factor everything else in. Especially if you follow the Reddit thread I think this will be a good watch. While this show can be a miss with some people, I think a majority people if they just give it a chance and watch it all the way through would like it more than they think. With all the theories and second guessing, it was actually a mystery, despite the plot not being a traditional mystery. I'm one of the people who watched this show genuinely, although I am able to see from the eyes of those watching it as an unintentional comedy. It does have a WTF factor. Either way you watch it, I think Mayoiga is a series that can be easily enjoy and does a good job at what it does.\\n\r\nOverall: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: While Mayoiga is an anime which right now is highly contested as good vs. bad, I think that it completes it's duties as an anime and is very entertaining. While some consider it bad they have still watched the anime and been hooked, which makes me question if that just means it is good. It at times can be confusing or WTF inducing, but all the other factors of the show along with how addicting it is makes it a good show. Whether you are watching it as a joke or genuinely I believe you will be able to enjoy the series.",

One of the most talked about anime of Spring \u201816, Mayoiga deceived whatever target audiences it was trying to lure in; at first it seemed like a group of weirdos assimilating into an uncharted society, then it seemed to be a murder mystery, but really it was\u2026 a psychological \u201chorror\u201d involving freaky CG monsters.\r\nOh.\r\nMayo-egg starts off with thirty Redditors getting on a bus headed for the middle of nowhere, so they can start newlives in an uncharted village. Fucking millennials these days. And I almost wanted to drop the show after the first five minutes, because they were spent on introducing each character, one by one, as if anyone\u2019s expected to remember them. And they\u2019re ALL tropes. I get that only a fucking crazy idiot would get on this magic school bus to hell, but very few are actually insane\u2026 everyone else is just an anime trope. The guy who raps all the time. The guy who eats food all the time. The potential serial murderer who doesn\u2019t talk. Is this supposed to be some big joke?\\n\\n\r\nApparently it is, actually. A lot of people have concluded that Mayoiga\u2019s general lack of seriousness and incredibly trope-y characters make this a comedy series rather than some horrific drama.

Anything else? \u2018Cuz people taking silly situations really seriously\u2026 isn\u2019t a very uncommon thing in anime, specifically bad anime. Maybe I just don\u2019t enjoy subtle humor in general, because I was only interested when the really crazy shit was happening. All hail Lovepon. But otherwise, I wasn\u2019t amused by the mob mentality of the villagers or their dumb conversations and theories.\\n\\n\r\nI do believe this could\u2019ve at least been improved easily, though. They should\u2019ve reduced the headcount significantly. This statement is a small spoiler, but only one person dies. With the amount of characters, it\u2019s no surprise that most people expected a weekly massacre. (RIP to the guy on /r/anime who made a status chart for this exact reason.) But no, everyone sticks around and pops up every now and then (\u201cthen\u201d being \u201cmaybe once every three episodes if they\u2019re lucky\u201d) to give their amazing (read: fucking annoying) one-liner, then back to filler hell they go. Keep the characters that actually have presence. No one cares about the guy who talks about eating, or Yuuna, or Yuuna, or Yuuna. Having less characters would at least give an excuse to have more CG monsters. \\n\\n\r\nIf anything, violence would\u2019ve made the show more entertaining. Or maybe if this turned into a huge game of Town of Salem. Ever played that? It\u2019s a game where the townspeople have to find everyone evil and hang them, or the evil people have to kill all the townspeople. Watching everyone point fingers furiously and falsely killing off each other would\u2019ve been a fun time for the whole family. But instead of a simple, entertaining show to watch while getting shit-faced drunk with your friends, Shirobako\u2019s director goes with\u2026 people getting attacked by monsters created by their mental stress. You know, the classic.\\n\\n\r\nI guess it\u2019s one thing to be surprising, and Mayoiga is pretty interesting and creative with its concept, but it\u2019s like mixing peanut butter with mac and cheese. They\u2019re both awesome on their own, but putting them together is strange and not very fun. We\u2019ll be right back after this public service announcement.\\n\\n\r\n[The author of this review recommends that you do not mix peanut butter with mac and cheese. It does not taste good. Thank you for your attention.]\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I\u2019m not really sure what this anime was supposed to be. If it was a drama, it was too wacky to take seriously. If it was a mystery, it didn\u2019t leave people guessing, just in a state of confusion. If it was a comedy, it simply wasn\u2019t funny enough. And if it was supposed to be all of them at once\u2026 well, it sucked.\\n\\n\r\nThe art just kinda sucks. That\u2019s it. Nothing is specifically bad about it, it\u2019s just kinda mediocre because most of it is people standing or sitting around, talking. Facial expressions and camera angles don\u2019t do anything to help or harm it, but the lighting is pretty decent, as much of the show takes place during the night, so expect a lot of dimly lit rooms and\u2026 campfires. Yeah, campfires. For roasting marshmallows, and sometimes witches. The CG is beyond jarring, it\u2019s fucking hyper-realistic like we\u2019re in a shitty creepypasta. But that\u2019s kinda the point and they\u2019re consistent with it, so it\u2019s good in a strange way? Quite an oddity, it is.\\n\\n\r\nIf this show had music, let me know. \u2018Cuz I sure as hell didn\u2019t notice anything. The OP is about average; the song has some heart but sounds cheaply produced; the mixing doesn\u2019t sound very even, and the instrumentation sounds lacking, somehow. But it has a good vocal melody, at least. The ED is a strange, but fitting song to close each episode with; it\u2019s a soft acoustic ballad and it\u2019s quite nice. I don\u2019t have anything to say about the voiceovers because of the sheer number, but whoever played the based goddess Lovepon is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy Mayoiga? Eh. I didn\u2019t not enjoy it, save for the extremely slow start. But with a general lack of focus, I don\u2019t think it was a matter of not enjoying it, it\u2019s just that there wasn\u2019t much to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3/10\\n\r\nArt - 4/10\\n\r\nSound - 3/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4/10\\n\r\nCraziness - EXECUTE!!!!/10\\n\r\nOverall - 4/10\\n\r\nFavorite character - Lovepon\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 6\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Low",

            "content": "I haven't written an anime review in a LONG time (the shorts I've reviewed lately don't really count) but this show really got me thinking. So, time to share:\r\nStory:\r\nFirst off, this narrative is complex. That is not to say it is hard to understand. Complex merely means there are many facets at work, and there really is a whole lot going on. A good writer tailors a multitude of facets together to tell a strong, tight-knit narrative. However, while there's great ambition to this project, it ultimately fails. The more someone puts into a story, the less wiggle room one has for mistakes. As theshow starts, you're never quite sure what exactly is going on, and the benefit of the doubt is that choices for the show are merely stylistic. Because of that, it's easy to forgive. However, as the episodes continue, there comes a point when things simply aren't consistent anymore. That's when one recognizes it isn't stylistic, they're mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't helped by the amount of absurd, unrealistic, unrelatable characters in Mayoiga. I think the more anime I watch, the more I have to realize that I am not the demographic being targeted. Ever. The target for so many shows seems to be those who enjoy characters who repeat the same word over and over, stereotypical glasses-wearing know-it-alls, and repetitive quirks that just don't exist in the real world. These are stupid tropes to have in an arguably serious work. There's no argument against this. A serious work needs serious characters.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the above is more limited to supporting roles, main characters have unengaging character arcs as well. They seem to start and end abruptly from time to time. It's like whiplash to the nth degree the way the pacing is with these arcs.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't really spoiler territory but if you what I'm comparing to, then ultimately you're gonna find it easier to infer what's going on in the show after reading this part of the review. Basically, this show feels a lot like Angel Beats!. 1-dimensional characters in an absurd premise that has a potentially engaging story surrounding it ultimately soiled by poor pacing with overly dramatic scenes just aren't my thing, and Mayoiga seems to emulate what some people thought was great with the former. From where I stand as someone who didn't like Angel Beats!, I just can't understand why someone would want to emulate such a premise.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, something about Mayoiga remained way more engaging to me than Angel Beats!. Despite the cancer that plagues Mayoiga's entire story, the show seems to have this odd 'it-factor' to it for me that simply kept me waiting for the next episode. Perhaps it's the seemingly well-timed cliffhangers, or maybe it's simply because I hopelessly want to enjoy a horror anime despite knowing how bad horror anime is. All I know is this, I couldn't stop watching the show. I just had to watch the next one. There's this draw that I simply can't explain, especially when there's so much NOT GOOD about the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to briefly try and engage this conundrum, it's that Mayoiga's complexity sells you to the end. Then, once it's over, everything comes rushing back and you go, \"I knew that didn't make sense then and excused it to continue, but now I really have to admit how absurd those choices were.\" And I'll admit, I recognized the absurdity of some choices but only near the end of the series did it really click how bad some narrative choices are.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI'll be the first to admit that moe art is NOT my style. And while this show is not 100% moe, it's that cutesy artistic theme that's plaguing anime right now and boy-howdy do I hate it. To compare: each character has relatively the same body-type and their only differences are hair and clothing. I think it's hilarious that there's actually a character designer in the anime industry nowadays. Just have some sort of algorithm churn out these suckers and save you a buck. There's clearly no inspiration for these things anymore.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also important to note that the scenery of the entire show is largely the same. It's also pretty dang dark and because of this, you're lead even more to focus on the character in frame rather than anything surrounding them. Also, the show takes place in an abandoned village but it might as well take place in a cabin.\\n\\n\r\nSome people might really disagree with me here but I liked the creature renderings for the first few bits of the show. I think it's important to recognize that in horror, to make something scary is to make it other-worldly. One of the most effective ways to do this in animation is to change the type of animation style you're using for your creature. This was used well for 1 creature and so-so for a few others. However, it doesn't last long as the final creature is laughably bad. Which leads us into:\\n\\n\r\nAnimation! While the show flows well, there were a few times where proportions threw me off. However, I think this was due to emulating certain camera effects. However, the most pitiful were 2 creatures, one in the middle and the one at the end. I'm talking horrid. There's other-worldly animation and then there's hiring an otherworldly creature to work on a worldly program without giving him a translation book for the Japanese language to read your program. *heavy breathing*\\n\\n\r\n//Sidenote: I know, this is getting long-winded. Bear with me!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI found some of the soundtrack compositions to be pretty good. I wasn't totally choked up with emotion by any of the tracks, nor did any of them necessarily get me pumped during any intense scenes, but I will say that they are unfortunately used in a forgettable anime. It's a shame that we'll never get to hear them used in something better.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, poor timing on a few tracks and I remember hearing one legitimately replay after a short delay. Like, it was so jarring and distracting. The song came to an end, (like a 1 minute long loop) and then pause, then restart and it was so strange.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, that final creature had such a dumb sound. It was only made worse when it repeated like 4 times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI find myself wanting to copy/paste the story section for this one. I genuinly shook my head because I was about to.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to add anything new about the characters, it's that this sort of thing happens to a lot of anime. I'm talking a LOT of anime. Seeing 1-dimensional characters is not uncommon and the problem is that people eat this stuff up like it's fresh lobster at a 5-star restaurant. I recognize that this anime has a <6 scoring and that's great because this show does not deserve anything higher than a 6, but the problem is I see things like this all the time in popular anime. Remember how I mentioned Angel Beats!? These 2 shows are so-totally similar it's maddening to see how Angel Beats! remains so popular. But I digress. I'm not talking about characters, I'm talking about the concept of Mayoiga as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, writers think this stuff is okay because of so many shows LIKE Angel Beats! sell figures, BD's, posters, extra memorabilia that nowadays runs the market due to rampant torrenting. However, this issue isn't all the consumers fault, as people wouldn't torrent shows if producers wouldn't churn out 12-episode advertisements for their mobile games every season (I'm doing it again, aren't I lol). It's so much easier for companies to simply BS their way with writing than it is to spend a week one one character arc, then melding it with anothers.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the sad thing is with Mayoiga is that we have a work that's stuck in the middle, where part of it wants to be Angel Beats! with 1-dimensional absurd characters and the other wants to have a complex narrative. It's like 2 scripts were forcefully prostitued to produce some frankenstein monster of a narrative. It's a shame. But the biggest shame of all is that I spent the entire character section talking about the concept of bad anime and not about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nBut what is there to say? They're all bad. Lol.\\n\\n\r\nJK I liked Lion. She was underused. =3\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nSo do I regret the show? Not necessarily. I think there's a lot wrong here but I also think there's a lot right? Like I said, there's an 'it-factor' at play for me and I know this is purely opinion based. But, even after thinking it through, I can't think of any reason to HATE this anime other than what I suspect it may represent (see: Character section lol).\\n\\n\r\nIdk, watch it I guess. you might dig it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n((I might start doing more reviews again so watch out!

            "content": "Mayoiga is a perfect example of a third-rate anime that takes itself too seriously with its cardboard characters and creates few unintended pitying chuckles.\r\nA group of people travels to a hidden village to start life anew. Character introductions start immediately, with the worst possible way, letting each one stand up and talk. They are all eccentric and therefore typical in anime, each you might have seen in any other average show. \r\nThe anime relies heavily on the mystery aspect to grab attention. It is all good and nice, but for a mystery to work, one needs to connect with characters. Otherwise, who cares about anuninteresting nobody experiencing problems? Another part of the mystery is the character backgrounds, which for obvious reasons are revealed slowly, and unsurprisingly, we discover that many characters have some tragic past. The creators don\u2019t fail to use the easiest way of characterization. They make them victimized. To create the villains, they make them despicable caricatures. \\n\\n\r\nYou can spot the main character the instant you see his ordinariness among others on the bus. He is our hero, weak-looking, a coward now and then, but defending others selflessly, kind, bland, nice, wimp, boring. In short, a face you\u2019re already familiar with. After a person is lost our wise hero asks, \u201cIs it really a good idea to call the police?\u201d If it isn\u2019t, then only in an event of genocide people should call the police. There is an aloof character, a shy one, a cute one, a potential murderer one, a silent one, a tsundere one, a psycho girl, an adventure-seeking one, an aspiring detective, a middle-aged bus driver who acts like a whiny child, a bossing type, a messing-around potential rapist one. The list goes on. They are slightly crazy, illogical and violent. All for the shock factor.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters take themselves too seriously. They are like children playing adult. They can make you chuckle and cringe few times with their overacting. The anime tries clumsily to add some plot twists but fails embarrassingly. Great plot twists come with characters we love, they aren\u2019t just unexpected turn of events.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is ordinary, too ordinary. It could be made a decade ago and nobody could tell the difference. The sound is as unimpressive as the animation, with a forgettable opening and ending. There are many anime out there which heavily rely on great visuals and sound, effectively redeeming poor plot. Mayoiga isn\u2019t one of them. Low budget is apparent from the very beginning.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s painful to write a negative review of any anime. Long working hours and low wages in the industry make everyone hesitate. Yet, every year watching dozens of generic works that will be soon forgotten isn\u2019t helping. Wishing to see something extraordinary, solid, awesome demands fans to be harsh in their criticism. A genuine art piece is visceral, stays with us, inspires us, and sometimes makes us better or worse persons. Mayoiga, a below mediocre work, delivers not much enjoyment. It isn\u2019t worth it, but you can force yourself to over-think or lower your expectation to get some pleasure. For me, Mayoiga is a passing memory. It will be forgotten and lost in few seasons, thrown into the dustbin of anime history.\\n",

            "content": "There's this 2015 movie called Tag that's on Youtube as of this moment. It's by my favorite present-day foreign film director, Sion Sono, and it's easily one of the best modern-day horror movies I've seen in a long time. It was creepy. It was funny. Its take on puberty was pretty cool. And even if you don't agree with me on the film's quality, I think most of you would be hard-pressed to deny that it was better than watching Diomedea's attempt at scaring the living daylights out of people with their shitty horror comedy about a bunch of faceless rejects whining about personal problemsno one gives a shit about.\\n\\n\r\nOkay okay, I know I'm setting a low bar when bringing up the name, Diomedea - a studio so faceless and forgettable that I'll bet most of you fans of the magical boy high school show aren't aware that they're the ones behind it. And it's true, my reaction to most horror anime is about as positive as a baby fry's when they instantly wake up to their mother about to celebrate their birth by swallowing them whole. So to say I was shocked that Mayoiga ended up being crap is like saying the majority of the U.K.'s intelligent population was surprised that Boris Johnson didn't keep the majority of his manifesto promises when it came time to deliver on them.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the only thing that was shocking about this show was the cult fanbase that erupted in its wake. I wasn't sure what they were seeing at first until I realized that the director was Tsutomu Mizushima - the guy who gave us critically acclaimed shows like Shirobako and unintentionally funny trash like Another - and that everybody who went into this show knew he was the guy behind the anime beforehand. No seriously. Name me one guy who loved this anime's atrociousness that didn't look up who the director was. Apparently, in order to enjoy this anime and that godawful Hippopotamus song, you'd have to know the director, have watched Another, have found that show hilarious, and make constant comparisons to that show whilst using other people who think similarly to back you up. Those are not acceptable conditions for liking a show! That's ten levels below needing to read the original source material in order to appreciate an adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's talk about the anime itself. It's focused on a group of thirty boys and girls...guys, if you want to make Battle Royale, just make Battle Royale. Lord knows we could use an actual animated adaptation of that rather than another goddamn copycat that only barely acknowledges the original inspiration. Anyways, it's about a group of thirty on a tour to a mysterious village so they can start over their lives or something. I dunno. The details of the tour were so loosely defined that apparently one person joined just so she could shoot things without anyone complaining. When they get to the village, they discover it's been abandoned and certain members of their tour start mysteriously disappearing, so they start looking for...bwahahaha! Actually, they just mostly ignore the people who disappear in favor of discovering the secrets of the village itself. And trust me when I say that Nanaki Village ain't exactly Gravity Falls.\\n\\n\r\nThe series basically goes through its story by having each episode consist of one section of the main cast searching for answers, another section revealing their pathetic sob story that will in no way affect the plot other than influencing whatever CG monster ends up chasing them, and a section where the characters just act crazy for no reason other than they can. Oh yeah, I should probably explain those CG monsters. They're basically supposed to be physical manifestations of the characters' deepest fears, so they take the form of giant bees or penguins or whatever the fuck you call Hayato's thing that looks like a cross between a homeless woman, a malformed spider, and a giant turd. And to be fair, the fears do have potential on paper like parental abuse and dead family. But it also matters how you convey those fears, and Mayoiga seems to think that the best way to do that is to say the children have them. Well tough, but so do a lot of people in real life. What makes these fictional characters special?\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the solutions these characters come up with to resolve their issues are pathetic. Nothing but power of friendship and yelling their feelings, which is the fucking white noise of teen drama resolution at this point. Not saying that that can't be an effective way to resolve a conflict, but Haibane Renmei's finale earned it through its strong usage of religious metaphors supplementing a sin that's vaguely defined on purpose towards a character that was more than just a cliche. Mayoiga has nothing of the sort to elevate the drama but camp, and really shitty camp to boot. There's a scene where the characters are threatened by fire arrows (fucking rolling in creativity right here) and all they can do is react to getting shot the same way most people react to watching The Neon Demon after ingesting sleeping pills. Granted they were under a spell that made them lethargic, but when someone flat-out states that a fire arrow isn't effective as a lethal weapon to justify their drowsiness whilst another person states you need to bring a matchlock gun to get them scared, I start rolling my eyes. Even if they look lame and you can't cause a fire with them, a fire arrow will still kill you if it hits you in the fucking neck.\\n\\n\r\nMind you, I would have done less eye-rolling if that had actually happened. Or if anyone had actually died in this show. Yeah, despite the fact that it's marketed as a horror story and borrows heavily from works that feature creative ways to kill people, every single character is alive by the time the series ends. Not a single one is beheaded or set on fire or even given as much as a scar in this show despite multiple opportunities to do so. And no, I'm not for torture and brutal deaths even if it's done to characters I don't like, but you might as well have gone that route and entertained someone in the audience if you weren't going to give us anything other than this half-assed attempt at a redemption story. I was talking about this show with a bunch of friends at Expo and we all agreed at being super disappointed that nothing even approaching a bloodbath ever occurred. When we expect a setup similar to Battle Royale, we expect an ending similar to Battle Royale as well.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on complaining about everything else this show does wrong (Hayato's possessive nature towards the main dude, anyone?), but I've got limited time this weekend and most of you guys have already moved on from the show by now, so let's just get to the important questions.\\n\\n\r\nIs it scary? No. The monsters look worse than the CG alien from Howard the Duck, they move so slow that they couldn't catch up to a bus dragging the Statue of Liberty behind it, the tonal shifts ruin any sense of dread, and you cannot seriously expect me to believe that a penguin whose only method of attack is to punch you with its flipper could possibly threaten my life any more than I could threaten his with a kick to the stomach.\\n\\n\r\nIs it funny? No. There's way too much expository dialogue, the imagination in these scenarios is bog-standard, and I have it on good authority that anticlimaxes that halt plot progression (and more importantly, seeing these unlikable characters fall into a grinder) have never in the history of mankind been humorous.\\n\\n\r\nIs the psychology interesting? For a first draft maybe. This entire show feels like it got animated because the final script burnt up in an accident and all the production team had to meet the deadline was something they had previously thrown away once they were done choosing a compelling direction to take these elements. Nothing about this show feels like the creators were giving it their all, like they realized what sort of crap they were dealing with it and proceeded to just not care. The animation and cinematography are incredibly flat, the character designs clash badly with the setting like putting the cast of Dragonball Z into Shin Sekai Yori, and the ending feels like something M. Night Shyamalan's malfunctioning robot clone would come up with before getting thrown into the trash heap.\\n\\n\r\nIs my review of this show over? Yes it is. I've got better things to do than wasting anymore of my time on this pig shit. Like reviewing Big Order...oh wait.",

            "content": "Mayoiga isn't as bad as some people say it is. It's really just an average show with lots of wasted potential. It belongs in the solid 6.5 range. Watch it if you are a fan of anime psychological thrillers like \"Another\" by P.A. Works, otherwise you should pass. If you are curious to know why, read on.\r\nWhat we have here is an example of how a show can be interesting and original but not necessarily well done. We start with a bunch of shady characters riding a tour bus into a mysterious supernatural town where they intend to restart their lives. If there is onething Mayoiga does right, it's a premise that gets you hooked and interested in what is going to happen next. Unfortunately, what happens next is somewhat of a let down.\\n\\n\r\nThe first issue is the characters themselves. Only a small handful of them are ever really fleshed out in detail. The majority of them are one dimensional, with hardly any backstory given. This is a case where Mayoiga would have actually been better with fewer characters. It goes the \"Quantity over quality\" route, where instead of a good story with a few well done individuals we get a massive cast of random people with most of them doomed to sit in the backseat throughout the show. The characters that it does focus on are fun enough to be entertaining, but it still feels like something is missing.\\n\\n\r\n*Note: The rest of this review contains minor spoilers as it is difficult to explain the further problems of Mayoiga without doing so.*\\n\\n\r\nThe second and bigger issue is Mayoiga isn't exactly sure what kind of anime it wants to be. Is it a comedy? Is it a horror? Is it a serious psychological drama? Mayoiga tries to be a little bit of each without really showing mastery of any one of them. Again, the same mistake of quantity over quality is made. For the first few episodes it seems like Mayoiga wants to be a horror comedy, leading the viewer into expecting that the minor background characters will start being killed one by one in a wonderful trainwreck of gore and madness. The sad thing is, Mayoiga would have actually been a better show if that happened. At least then it could have became a cult classic among fans of the macabre. The reality is ...no one dies. This is not a gore flick. Mayoiga comes close to pushing itself in that direction but then never does. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of forming a coherent plot and sticking with it, Mayoiga stumbles from genre to genre and then suddenly decides it wants to have a serious story about psychological trauma in the end. The result is that nothing Mayoiga does is particularly good. It never really goes anywhere and in the final scene as the characters hop back into their tour bus to ride home it's hard to really care about what you just watched.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I am obligated to warn you that Mayoiga is incredibly flawed. Not a single aspect of it, be its story, art, or characters, was without its problems. However, I would argue that Mayoiga scrapes a pass based purely on the positively valiant (if ultimately unsuccessful) effort expended by its producers to create something ambitious and different.\r\nStory\r\nMayoiga\u2019s premise was extremely interesting. It almost seemed to pay tribute to Silent Hill \u2013 both featuring an abandoned town full of monsters representing your deepest, darkest fears. And whilst Mayoiga had a promising start, leaving me wondering what had happened to the village\u2019s inhabitants and what could be makingthat horrific noise, the following issues soon became clear: the plot twists bordered on the ridiculous (wait\u2026 was that a giant penguin?), very little actually happened within the show\u2019s course, the rules by which the town operated were too vague, and the show ended too abruptly with no real sense of resolution (as many of its cast were not shown battling their demons). In other words, Mayoiga lacked all of Silent Hill\u2019s masterful storytelling and subtlety.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nMayoiga also struggled in terms of its characters. It was far too ambitious, cramming 30+ characters into just 12 episodes. And whilst Mayoiga did \u2013 bravely \u2013 try and give as many characters as possible backstory, these characters had it shoe-horned in with no prior build-up and seemed to be bestowed the privilege randomly. Some of the most unimportant characters were given backstory, whereas more important ones were not. This show also wasted no time emphasising what a cast of unhinged weirdoes it had, making that plain during the very first scene. This made it painfully clear that things were not going to go to plan for the group right from the beginning, leaving no room for a gradual increase of tension. Finally, Mitsumune, the main character, was too agreeable, wanting to believe in everybody, no matter how implausible their story. This meant that he often lightened a scene\u2019s tone where I would have preferred to see it become darker. Mitsumune would have felt better placed in a light-hearted shounen rather than a horror story.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Music\\n\r\nWhat distinguishes Mayoiga\u2019s art from that of other shows is its hideous CGI. It would cram horrific CGI monsters, the likes of which wouldn\u2019t be out of place in low budget Syfy films, into scenes with otherwise attractive art. This dramatic contrast is likely to produce one of three responses: amusement, derision, or revulsion. I like to think Mayoiga was aiming for the third response. The CGI was so unnatural-looking and sometimes so deep within the uncanny valley that I often found myself saying \u201cOh, God, what the hell is that!?\u201d And shuddering with disgust. Given that these monsters were manifestations of the characters\u2019 deepest, darkest fears, this was a good response to have. You, however, may respond to it differently.\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga\u2019s music was alright, but I felt that the choice to use techno during fast-paced, tense scenes was out-of-sorts with its rural setting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment\\n\r\nMayoiga\u2019s plot twists were laughable, it bit off more than it could chew in terms of the number of its characters and their development, and dished up some of the worst CGI I\u2019ve ever seen, but I couldn\u2019t help but find myself endeared to and entertained by it. It was like a child giving you a shit crayon drawing, it was hard to tell what I was looking at at times, it wanted to be so many different things, and there was absolutely no rhyme or reason to it, but, boy, did the producers try their best to create something. Would I recommend it? Hmm\u2026 Probably, but try not to take it too seriously.",

            "content": "Mayoiga is something that I can only describe as the closest anime will ever get to achieving M.Night Shamalamadingdong status. It\u2019s got it all, awkward as heck dialogue, absurd characters, and of course surreal plot twists that just make us go \u201cWHOA, that\u2019s kinda dumb\u201d. What can I say, I loved it for all the wrong reasons. \r\nWhat It Does Right: \r\n+A Weird, Trolling Take on the Horror/Psychological Genre\r\nMayoiga like a good old Shyamalan film has that weird feeling that kicks in as soon as you start watching. Who are these characters, Why are they here, What the heck are they doing? These questions justpop up and as soon as you want to leave you just can't help, but be entranced by the surrealism that keep you in through the end as seen by the many people who watched this through to the end knowing it was trash. This show is the embodiment of a troll if I ever saw one. By just reading the synopsis and looking at pictures and PVs, you would come to your own conclusions that people are gonna die left and right or Lord of the Flies-esque conflicts or just Another 2.0. Mayoiga knows this and gives us the revelations that would have your hand glued to your face while the creators are laughing in their studio.\\n\\n\r\n+Soundtrack Fits I Guess?\\n\r\nTo fit in with the weird tone with the show is a soundtrack that offers equal absurdity, mystery, and tension. It doesn\u2019t sound exactly serious, but it\u2019s one that seems to embrace the show\u2019s constant love for wacky moments and cliffhangers. I can\u2019t help, but get invested into the show no matter how much I tried to pull back cause the soundtrack keeps trolling me into thinking that the show might pull something serious (only to be replaced by absurdity once again). The opening does a similar job by giving us a catchy opening to remind us that this show might actually be trying and that these characters have names. The ending theme is actually a nice soothing track that reminds me of camping trips. Congrats for the voice actors for keeping up with their crazy characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat It Does Wrong (aka Everything Else):\\n\\n\r\n-30 Characters, All Bizarrely Dreadful\\n\r\n30 characters in a 12 episode show is astounding. Mayoiga doesn\u2019t bother to make any of them break beyond 1 dimensional. Instead of adding any semblance of depth, the show gives each character a cookie cutter-personality and multiplies that to unbearable levels and have each talk to one another with the effort of a low-level fanfiction. The result making every character hilariously horrendous. The main lead is the most irritatingly generic lead you can think of. Another character is so obsessed with executions to a point that she can\u2019t go a sentence without mentioning \u201cEXECUTE\u201d and yet somehow she is one of the most trusted characters in the show\u2026 yeah you get the point.\\n\\n\r\n-\u201cDevelopment\u201d is Bizarrely Dreadful\\n\r\nNot even a third of the cast get a backstory, which goes to show how useful they are to the story. When a character does get their backstory revealed, it feels as if it has nothing to do with the why the characters act the way they do. They only serve to add more absurdity in a show that is already overflowing with it. In the case that character development might happen, it happens way too fast and is brushed off as an afterthought. The theme of the show is accepting your past, but Mayoiga didn\u2019t seem too interested in fleshing that out at all.\\n\\n\r\n-Dialogue is Bizarrely Dreadful\\n\r\nWhat the heck are these people blabbering about? Why are they saying that now? Do you know what situation you\u2019re in? These are questions you\u2019ll constantly be wondering every time someone in Mayoiga opens their mouth. The interactions between the characters are quite fascinating. The delivery feels so awkward when it tries to be serious and the rest of the lines seem devoted to calling its own crap out. One of the more used gags being self-aware enough to know that 30 characters is way too much and forgetting each other\u2019s names is just one of the many jabs to break the ice.\\n\\n\r\n-Generic Designs Except a Bizarrely Dreadful CGI\\n\r\nEvery character design is painfully generic and the animation to support that is equally bleh. There is nothing else to say. The backgrounds are okay and kind of give off a feeling of a lost village, but even then it still feels derivative and lacks the atmosphere to be taken even slightly seriously. Mayoiga doesn\u2019t try anything special to catch your eye with the exception of a certain use of CGI. When this CGI contraption was put to use, it was beyond jarring, beyond ugly, and just laugh out loud bad. Oh yeah CGI jumpscares, ew.\\n\\n\r\n-When it\u2019s not Bizarrely Dreadful, it\u2019s Boring\\n\r\nMayoiga can\u2019t even seem to maintain its stupidity and when it doesn\u2019t, it devolves to just bad and boring which is the worst combination. The characters just spout off random gibberish with no connection because it\u2019s \u201cpart\u201d of their personality and it leads to a good while of disengaging banter going nowhere. This happens quite a few times throughout the show and it reveals the Mayoiga\u2019s true colors as a trainwreck that just keeps on moving. You know a show is bottom of the barrel when you want it to just stop trying and embrace it\u2019s idiocy.\\n\\n\r\n-Being So Bad it\u2019s Good Still Makes You Bad\\n\r\nMasterpieces like Sharknado, Birdemic, or The Room are loved for just how much of a disaster they are even if the intent was serious. Even then, people label those as 1-3/10, and Mayoiga in my opinion should be no exception. Even if the show supplied me with laughs every episode that does not equate to the show being any better in quality. Maybe this show will be a cult classic, but the unmemorable characters will stay unmemorable and the attempts at being mysterious will stay ridiculous. But what if the show was intentionally bad? Mayoiga\u2019s over-the-top characters, seemingly self-aware dialogue, and love for ruining expectations make it seem bad on purpose. If this was the case, that makes Mayoiga even worse since that implies that the makers are intentionally okay with showing us terrible shows and that is not okay.\\n\\n\r\nMy Pointless Enjoyment:\\n\r\nOut of all the shows in the Spring 2016 season, I enjoyed Mayoiga the most. It was just too funny. I was sucked into the awfulness and I looked forward to every week to see if the show could top itself in it\u2019s foolishness and it never failed to amaze me. I popped out my seat in pure awe with each infuriating cliffhanger and every idiotic revelation. This is the perfect show to group watch with your buddies in your dorm, anime club, or just anywhere. Something about Mayoiga has a special charm and if that charm gets to you, you\u2019ll be in for a wild ride.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIn the end, I gotta give the show props for pulling all the crap it did while painting it with a nice coat of absurdity. For other anime recommendations I got nothing, you\u2019ll likely never get an experience like Mayoiga ever again. So you know what, give it a try. Maybe you\u2019ll have a blast like I did, or maybe you\u2019ll drop it in half an episode and I won\u2019t blame you. I give Mayoiga a 2/10.\\n\\n\r\nPS: Feel free to comment on my review. I'm always up for advice so I can improve my reviewing skills. Thanks for reading!",

You see, it can't work from the beginning, there is too little time. Everything feels constructed and all people are boring. The characters act absurd to fit the plot and instead of developing empathy with the characters to feel for them we just start hating them. I don't care about them. The solution at the end seems false and plastic. After ~6 episodes I thought 'Awww man! Just die already altogether!' I wish I had aborted the show.  It's awaste of time. Just don't watch it, please!",

            "content": "This anime failed at pretty much everything. Instead of writing a long ass review, I'm just going to write it in points. \r\n- This show failed as a Horror because there was nothing remotely scary about this show. The only scary part about this show is how badly paranoid these characters are and how they seriously need to go to a therapist. There's also a bunch of monsters in this show but they're not scary because some them of looked ridiculous like a giant penguin monster and a giant breast-cup monster. Yes, \"Breast-cup\"...I kid you not. Haha, you think they're going to use ghosts totry and scare you? Nope.  \\n\\n\r\n- This show failed as a Drama because there was nothing good about the show's drama. It took itself too seriously and instead of grabbing my heart to show how much I feel bad for the characters, I grabbed my face to show I much I face palmed throughout this series. I can barely focus on one \"sad\" flashback because there's a lot of them jam-packed into 2-3 episodes or probably more and you expect me to feel bad for 5, 6, 7, 8 characters just because their \"tragic\" flashbacks were shown? That's not enough. \\n\\n\r\n- This show failed as a Mystery. The show might seem mysterious at first but you'll realize that it's not because of its stupid plot. It's also filled with stupid ass writing and at the end, you're going to be asking more questions than getting your questions answered. Like, why in the mother of god did some of the character suddenly become lazy and sleepy while the other half were completely active? \\n\\n\r\n- This show failed developing it's characters properly. Who in their right fucking mind thought that it was ok to have 30 characters in a 12 episode series? At the early 2nd half, they decided to fill 2-3 or so episodes with flashbacks of almost every major characters. The episodes felt like a steaming pile of mess while I was watching it because there were too many flashbacks. I did say almost every major characters right?....Some of the characters were just ignored and never to be seen again in the 2nd half. Hell, I don't even know 65% of the character's names. \\n\\n\r\n- Speaking of not developing its characters properly, the show also failed on the characters as a whole. Most of the characters were annoying and just plain stupid. Like cmon, you guys are in this weird village and you guys claimed that you're going to live in said village for the rest of your life yet you can't even fucking get along with each fucking other?!\\n\\n\r\n- This show failed as a Psychological because there was nothing psychological about this show. Most of the characters were just paranoid and screaming at each other because they have goddamn trust issues. Especially that \"Execute\" girl and Shouting Glasses-kun who have some serious trust issues against Masaki and they just wave off whatever she tries to fucking say even though all the things she said were true. \\n\\n\r\n- This show failed at Organization because everything in the show was all over the place and it was a mess. The story wasn't told properly and there was a lot of unanswered questions, especially the ending. The characters..Well, you already know what I'm going to say since I already said it 2 times. You can barely focus on one character in this series and a lot of characters were just forgotten in the late 2nd half of the series.  \\n\\n\r\n- This show failed as an Entertainment because there was nothing amusing about this show. Not the plot, not the characters, Nothing! Once the Summer Season comes, this show will be forgotten by almost everyone. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm ashamed that this show turned out to be one of the worst shows I've ever seen. This anime had the potential to become one of the best horror/mystery show because the premise was pretty cool. A bunch of people visited a Lost Village and something bad happened to them one by one. How awesome would that have been? They could have gone the \"Corpse Party\" route except less gorey and this show would have turned out good. Except what we got is a pile of horseshit anime filled with non-nonsensical writing, stupid plot, unlikable characters, too much characters in a 12 episode series and an ending that makes no fucking sense.",

            "content": "Like the majority of people, I had decent expectations when I started Mayoiga. Did these expectations follow through? They most certainly did not. \r\nPlot/Story (3/10):\r\nThe interesting premise as a ghost story/mystery was eye-catching, but this premise was quickly discarded and turned into a confusing, boring monster story formed from psychological scars. \r\nYou could tell throughout watching this anime that the team behind Mayoiga couldn't make up their minds about what they wanted it to be. If they had stuck to the idea about Nanaki Village being a mysterious ghost town, then perhaps this anime would have been slightly better, although there were many things wrongwith it other than the plot.\\n\r\nAnyway, I stuck with Mayoiga until the end with a few shreds of hope left. I really hoped that the ending would save it. Did it? \\n\r\nNo. And what's worse, the ending stole elements from Angel Beats!, but it did it badly. I think it was supposed to be emotional, but I ended up laughing at it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2/10):\\n\r\nIt's never good if the viewer would rather see all the characters dead rather than alive. This is true in my case, as I quickly came to dislike the majority of the characters. Their archetypal personalities were unfitting in some situations, for example, Lovepon's obsession with execution and torture was unnecessary in their situation, and even though this obsession was present from Episode 1 - 11, it seemingly disappeared in Episode 12 despite her psychological scar not being cured or accepted.\\n\r\nMitsumune was a pathetic excuse of a main character from the start, taking on a personality trait of that likening to Makoto Itou from School Days, the very first memorable thing he does in this anime is decide which girls he's attracted to and openly talk about it. This gets the attention of a tsundere I can't even remember the name of and Masaki. In the first few episodes there's an unstable love triangle between Mitsumune, the tsundere and Masaki, but it's quickly dropped when other situations arise. \\n\r\nThe only characters I liked in this anime were Nanko, Lion and Valkana. That's it. So, your anime has only three likable characters, you have a problem. \\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10):\\n\r\nThe art is mediocre at best, but 5/10 is the highest number anything in this anime is gonna get. The animation is nothing to admire, and the CG monsters are absolutely grotesque. No, not in their appearance, but just their designs and quality. I wouldn't expect very highly of CG in anime, but my god the monsters were probably the worst CG creations I've ever seen. \\n\r\nThe character designs are nice, I'll admit that. They were all pretty creative, especially Nyanta and Lion with their cat-like appearances.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music (4/10):\\n\r\nMeh. The soundtrack was definitely extremely repetitive, with the same guitar track playing over and over again in any mysterious moments or in moments where the characters come to some sort of realisation. Is this one guitar track any good? No. No it's not. I could tell from the start that the budget in the music department of this anime was low. When I discovered that Masaru Yokoyama was in charge of the music, I got very excited because he has a history of producing beautiful anime soundtracks, such as Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. However, he definitely fell flat here, because the music was definitely lacking.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3/10):\\n\r\nI was bored and it's a damn shame too. I had pretty good expectations at the start that sunk after Episode 3, and by the time Episode 5 came around, I was continuously asking myself \"Why did I even bother?\" \\n\r\nI constantly debated with myself whether or not I should drop Mayoiga during it's run, but I stuck around to see if it would become more enjoyable. The episodes featuring the characters' backstories were one of the best, and by the end of them I was hoping Mayoiga was getting better, but after the backstories came the appearance of the CG monsters, and from there Mayoiga sunk into another pit of disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10):\\n\r\nMayoiga is a show that will disappoint just about anyone watching it. If you're thinking about starting it, tread carefully and go in with the lowest expectations possible. It's a bad show, to put simply. \\n\r\nI'm just glad that most of the other Spring 2016 anime are good, or else it would be a very disappointing season indeed. Mayoiga can be thrown on the pile of boring and bland anime and can be quickly forgotten about the anime community in the coming months.",

Anyone who says that this is supposed to be a comedy is just trying to justify Mayoiga's horribleness for some sick reason. This show is not supposed to be funny, and it isn't. Despite its lighthearted moments, it is not enjoyable. \r\nThe story starts off very intriguing. The different characters who we see on the bus in the very beginning of the show seem like they could be unique. The story seems strange, but I think anyone would want to know where it is going.\r\nThis intrigue very quickly dies off as we see that the storymakes no absolutely no sense even though it tries really hard to do so. So many of the characters have horrible backstories or backstories that seem extremely half-assed. I waited the entire season to see what Lion's backstory was, and let's just say I was very let down. Why I kept watching is another question honestly. This is the kind of show that you keep hoping will get better but somehow manages to get worse with each episode.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems like the writers for this show just threw in random events and called it a show. So many things that happen in this show seem forced and obnoxious. \\n\\n\r\nPLEASE do yourself a favor and do not think to yourself, \"it can't be that bad,\" because I promise you it is that bad and worse.\\n\\n\r\nJust to clear something up, I really did have high hopes for this show and it was on the top of my list for its season. It was a real let down for me, and I wish I did not have to say all of these bad things about it. The characters might visibly look nice and the animation is decent, but the story and character development are just a sad mess.",

            "content": "Warning:  The following review contains mild spoilers to Mayoiga and Higurashi no naku koro ni (used as reference)\r\nThe Idea of the Show sounded Genius.   It actually also started out very well, keeping me interested if not glued to the screen the first ~3-4 episodes. After that it gradually lost quality so hard that i am stuck at 11 of 12 episodes and i dont even want to watch the last one because i could watch better anime in that time.\r\nWhen it started out, not only the show sounded genius,  but actually the first episode in a whole is basically insanely good.After Watching and playing the Higurashi saga, i wanted something suspenseful, basically horrifying which is not just some splatter shit (im looking at you corpse party).   In Higurashi for example, before the splatter begins, there is much suspense and excitement because the protagonist (and the viewer) has a growing feeling that something is wrong. A growing feeling of danger although there is no real threat at first.   The beginning of Mayoiga also had that feeling,   i also dare to say the potential was enormous. Few episodes later (about ep 3 or 4 i think) there are two things that you (as the viewer) think:   1. \"Maaan, i hate the protagonist. Hes such a wimpy crybaby b*tch\"    aaaand 2. \"the ever growing suspense came to a halt and nothing happens.  is this all?\"\\n\\n\r\nand well... after that it went downwards.    It of course got worse in a curve,  meaning that some very interesting and thrilling bits popped up here and then,  but in the end it got worse.         In Higurashi,  one of the factors that made it very thrilling was also that the viewer gets the impression of a supernatural force killing the people (season 1 beginning), but its not obvious meaning it COULD also be actual people with no supernatural shit whatsoever.         BUT IN MAYOIGA,   it becomes clear very fast that some supernatural shit is happening.\\n\\n\r\nAlso Mayoiga had some strangely annoying things (at least for me)...:\\n\r\n1. the couple always being lovey dovey while being in actual danger\\n\r\n2. every scene where someone runs away from someone/something (there were so many... something like 20 scenes of separate ppl running away from separate dangers)  and while i understand that this has to do with the positive message of the anime (never run away from your fears or something like that)   it was overused A F \\n\r\n3. The positive message.   Positive messages are a good thing-    IF they wouldnt be slapped in the face of the viewer about every 3 seconds by some obvious metapher.\\n\r\nIts like-   a moral of a story,     a positive message:  at the end of the anime you should be like \"i guess it had a positive message all the time brabrabra\"   but in this anime its more like: \"OK IM IN EPISODE 8 AND I GET F*STED BY A OBVIOUS SHALLOW \"DEEP\" MESSAGE WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE SOLE REASON EVERY CHARACTER IS IN THE SITUATION THEY ARE AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS HAPPENS.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that its a decent anime.",

            "content": "Maiyoga is like school camp trip, cluttered, fun and rife with misconceptions. It's this odd package that blurs the line between serious and nonsensical. At first the mystery will intrigue you but it soon becomes apparent that the main appeal stems from the sheer wackiness caused by the urban legend plaguing hysteria among our addled escapees.     \r\nCharacters will often not make sense and for the most part consist of cardboard cutout characters. To describe them all would be pointless, seeing as the very first episode executes this in a jarring introduction segment of which 20+ characters explain why they are leavingthere old lives behind. Execute is something that you will hear often, as Lovepon declares it every opportunity she gets. The sheer amount of characters over a twelve episode series did cause copious amounts of underdevelopment. Characters do grow, well at least a handful do but the plot decides that for them, rather it feeling like a natural progression. This did make the ending more interesting, which felt like what would realistically happen to our not so realistic and often divided cast.  \\n\\n\r\nMakeshift decisions make the outline of the story as factions dispute for the course of action. There could have been more back stabbing and turmoil but for the most part the way the story progressed was entertaining, the same way it is to be an outsider of a feud that continues to grow increasingly imaginative might be. It is hard to take anything too seriously given the reactions, imagery and atmosphere. At times it feels like there's these absurd things that are happening and the characters act nonchalant about it much like the humor in a David Lynch film. Then there are other times where the exact opposite happens enhancing the aforementioned effect. \\n\\n\r\nNothing in the art or sound departments where particularly memorable. Character designs were varied and well done with the exception of Mitsumune who had the stereotypical look of a protagonist with the brown hair and small framed combo. The monsters where entertainingly freaky and weird with the seemingly fit usage of CGI. The OST fails at making any source of credible suspense but otherwise fits the tone suitably. VA\u2019s give solid performances, special credits go to Lovepon whose outbursts capture the perfect amounts of insanity.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a well written, thriller with survival horror elements look elsewhere. Maiyoga is a fun albeit brief supernatural mystery that focuses on building conflict rather then tension. It's straight forward message of being able to accept tribulations from your past is perhaps overly simple but one which is worth experiencing if you can accept the bus load of flaws that come with it.",

Oh, no. It's because this show has been such absolute, raw, unfiltered shaite I feel the need to repeatedly clock a hammer over my little toe until the bone is all splinters as punishment for being masochistic enough to actually soldier through the entirety of it.\r\nThus, with a deep-rooted sigh, allow me to get downto it and tell you why this thing sucked donkey balls.\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga is a twelve-episode anime produced by Diomed\u00e9a, written by Mari Okada (and some two other dudes under her supervision) and directed by Tsutomu Mizushima. Both people who can actually be quite decent at their respective jobs, but I suppose a lot of booze and / or metaphysical prostitution (\u201cMoney, dear boy!\u201d) was involved, otherwise I can't fathom how anyone thought this thing was a good idea. Sure, the concept itself has potential, but the execution of it...not so much. Without being too spoilerific:\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY & CHARACTERS [ 1 / 10 ]\\n\\n\r\nThe premise: thirty people (generously described as being \u201ceccentric\u201d, which couldn't be a bigger lie even if Donald Trump were to head the marketing team \u2013 in actuality a bunch of social rejects running away from their \u201cproblems\u201d \u2013 Freudian excuses abound!) are gathered on a bus whose destination is a semi-mythical, urban-legend-status village, where \u201cdark things\u201d await them. Like I said, it has potential, provided it is executed well; such a setting gives leeway for a lot of contemplation on the nature of humanity, perhaps a la Lord of the Flies or Robinson Crusoe. \\n\\n\r\nThere's one tiny problem, you see. It wasn't executed well. \\n\r\nBy god, it wasn't executed well at all.\\n\\n\r\nFor a premise of this type to work, you need good characters, because they are responsible for driving everything and making you care. Unfortunately for Mayoiga, this is not the case. The characters are constructed as plot devices to forcefully hammer down the story as desired by the creators, regardless of whether or not their actions make sense, and on top of that (or perhaps as a result of it) I couldn't care less about any of them even if I tried. Hell, I couldn't care less even if somebody paid me.\\n\\n\r\nI could forgive the secondary characters being flat and underdeveloped \u2013 there is only so much you can do with such a short run, after all \u2013 but its' primary characters are just as plain. Since they all act in whatever way happens to suit the plot best, so there isn't much characterization to speak of, aside from the aforementioned Freudian excuses they are given for their behavior; they are simple archetypes, and crudely drawn ones at that. You have the Dark and Troubled Past pair of male protagonists, the zany girl who is really there more to be the love interest and get in trouble as a way to drive the story forwards than anything, the adult characters with a hidden motive, and the loads and loads of characters you forget about almost as soon as they've passed by on the screen. \\n\\n\r\nThere is not an ounce or trace of credibility to anything, and that's the root and bulk of the problem. Everything the characters do and say comes across as forced, and the plot they are made to carry out is one that is flimsy, predictable, and worst of all, ultimately uninteresting. \\n\\n\\n\r\nART [ 5 / 10 ]\\n\\n\r\nWhile not overly awkward or outright bad, it's simply plain. The character designs and backgrounds are as generic as everything else, and there is not even one shot that stands out in your memory.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND [ 5 / 10 ]\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I can't remember much about the sound, such as the background music \u2013 I can't even remember if there was any. I ended up skipping the opening and ending songs. As far as voice acting goes (I watched this with subs), it was as plain and soulless (and in some cases annoying) as the character the voice belonged to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT [ 1 / 10 ]\\n\\n\r\nAll I got out of this was a headache and an urge to write Hayao Miyazaki a letter and tell him that he was right when he said anime was a mistake. If everything I've said so far hasn't tipped you off just yet \u2013 I thoroughly disliked this. And it didn't even manage to make me dislike it in a passionate way; it has only managed to make me...apathetic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL [ 2 / 10 ]\\n\\n\r\nI reserve such low ratings for series that have truly and deeply wasted my time. The only reason I did watch all of this was out of a personal sense of pride, as I refuse to drop something once I've started it. Had I been anyone else, I would have backed out around the midpoint of the first episode; you can actually notice how cringe-worthy this show promises to be within the first fifteen minutes, and that promise is the only thing Mayoiga will not disappoint you on.\\n\\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and spare your brain from this mess.",

            "content": "There are two kinds of people: those who watch mystery as comedy, and those who watch comedy as mystery.\r\nMayoiga is the one responsible for it.\r\n-------- Story (3/10):\r\nWhat would happen if a bunch of troubled people who want to run away from their life come together just to be lost and trapped in a mysterious village? \r\nApparently, Mayoiga gives you two answers:\r\n1: The Mystery and Drama\r\nIt's quite good mystery to be honest, it makes you really curious about what actually happens there. Each episodes often ended with cliffhangers, and through out the series you will find yourself wtf-ing your screen. What actually happens next are oftenpretty shocking. However, don't expect any foreshadowing. This is the kind of mystery where you don't find any foreshadowing but the revelations keep on surprising you.\\n\r\nThe Drama is... Well, some are cliche, some are rather interesting.\\n\r\nThen, at the end of the series, it tries to convey a kind of messages to the audience through the psychological drama, although a crappy one. \\n\r\nRegardless, I personally like the ending, it's not the boring optimistic happy ending, neither it is a completely bad ending. \\n\\n\r\nAll of those mentioned aspects would make a pretty good anime, if only you can ignore the other face of Mayoiga...\\n\\n\r\n2: The Laughs.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a good chance you will look at Mayoiga as the \"it's so bad that it's good\" kind of anime.\\n\r\nThere's some reasons you would laugh from this anime: \\n\r\nFirst, because those people are a group of not so logical people, how the characters react with some incident and interact with each other are often so weird and funny that you can't hold your laughs. \\n\r\nSecond, is development that doesn't make sense, or just plain forced that it seems so funny.\\n\r\nThird, is awkward things which the show tries to tell in a serious way, but turns out to be so hilarious. Or, trying too hard to be unique, but ended up being awkward.\\n\r\nFor example (minor spoiler) : A monster that ended up remind you of 'Digimon' and 'Thomas and friends', the monster should be scary but looks hilarious instead. Example for the later is a detective who constantly and literally check extra fat in her stomach whenever she think. Like, why?\\n\r\nForth - is the plus, and actually related to the first point - is that some characters gives you rather catchy lines (in a hilarious way) frequently, like a constant buzzkill, which is very quotable or really worth for meme. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm not even sure myself anymore if the show coincidentally making it so hilarious or the creator actually trying to put some funny aspect in it.\\n\\n\r\nSo is this 'laughs' part makes the show worse or better? Personally, I found it adds the enjoyment. lol.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Story:\\n\\n\r\nLet's check the whole story from the start. The first episode gives a solid feels of mystery and horror, perhaps you will expect some gore. Knowing the background idea, this series could easily promise a crazy and chaotic anime (in a good way). Which is why people has such expectation: A mysterious chaotic bloody massacre, or at least a kind of like Danganronpa.\\n\r\nBut unfortunately, that's a wrong expectation.\\n\r\nInstead, it started as mystery and tried to graduate more toward psychological drama at the end.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering the background idea which it started and the final idea which it tries to graduate (which both are actually great ideas), Mayoiga is a perfect example of an anime with great idea but very poor execution - ended up somewhat hilarious.\\n\\n\r\n-------- Characters (4/10):\\n\r\n- 20 characters. I'm not even sure if I can remember everyone correctly. \\n\\n\r\n- The big number of characters create awkward-paced dialogues.\\n\\n\r\n- The character development feels rushed and forced. \\n\\n\r\n- Most are stereotypical, few are quite original.\\n\\n\r\n- Wrong expectation is: They all have the same amount of role. The truth is: Some has major role, some has minor role, some just being there to make some laughs aspect in the series, some are just addition to the number - perhaps so that it feels realistic enough to have enough member (20 person) which make that fishy trip seems less fishy. \\n\\n\r\n- There's around 5-8 characters that has no depth nor has any purpose to exist in the story. Perhaps their sole purpose are just to be the normal character that doesn't stand out, But the fact that they looks kind of unique, make us think that they're wasted. What's really wasted is when we think they're interesting but they actually don't have any role and we never get to know more about them. \\n\\n\r\n- There's a lot of characters that until the end, we never know their dark past and why they're there trying to start over their life. Some people might say that the series clearly doesn't have enough time to do the right thing for the characters. Heck, even some pretty important characters doesn't have clear background story, meanwhile some random characters has clear back story. Regardless, at least we want to know everyone's story, no matter how short. But we never get it from this show. \\n\\n\r\n- As mentioned before, the characters often make some weird/stupid actions and comments. Don't blame them for being illogical/retarded or accuse it as a bad writing. After all, that's exactly what the story is. They're troubled people whose soul/psyche hurt by their own life that they want to start over a new life as a new person, but unfortunately they are trapped in that panic anxious situation (albeit the anime show it with kind of awkward slow-paced mystery). Thus, It would be more irrational if they all are rational in their positions. \\n\\n\r\n- The good thing is: the characters cast serve a fairly good mystery. The one you think is suspicious is actually just a red herring. The one you think doesn't have important role is actually a very important character toward the end - sort of like that.\\n\\n\r\n-------- Music (4/10): \\n\r\nOpening is catchy and has a kind of dark feels.\\n\r\nEnding gives you the mood of hopelessness, \\n\r\nand the \"unlucky hippopotamus\" song is rather funny but disturbing. \\n\r\nThere's this eerie soundtrack that reminds me a lot to a soundtrack in RPG that always there whenever I'm in a dungeon and near the boss room, which is nice especially when it plays in the last episode near the end of this anime.  \\n\r\nthe rest is... well, they don't catch my attention, to be precise, they're boring and bland. \\n\r\nThe worse thing is, there's this part where it's showing a dangerous panic scene, and I'm pretty much sure I hear a music that sounds like soundtrack for comedic drama. I laughed despite what I see in the screen.  \\n\r\nThe thing is, sometimes this show will give you weird experience, since there's a chance you will be laughing while an eerie soundtrack plays in the background. Weird.\\n\\n\r\n-------- Art (4/10):\\n\r\nI can't really give any comment here. Everything is average, but nothing is really boring or plain. \\n\r\nThe character has diverse design and good. \\n\r\nBut some of the monster looks strangely laughable.  \\n\\n\r\n-------- Conclusions: \\n\r\nMayoiga is a strange anime - in a funny way. It's hard to find something as strange as this.\\n\r\nA fairly good mystery with hilarious things, the characters are done wrongly, and graduate as crappy psychological drama.\\n\r\nTry it if you still not sure, you will definitely know if you're interested to see it until the end through all the strangeness or just can't stand it. \\n",

Though a large amount of these characters are intentionally generic and bland being used entirely for comedic purposes some of them receive so little screen time and are so flat thatyou wonder why they're even there (though in a way that could be the sheer genius of it). Episodes 10 and 11 are largely exposition heavy and end up bringing up more questions than answers and in general being very stupid. The whole \"Boss\" thing with the Jack's, the becoming tired, lazy and unfiltered shit, it is all very stupid and poorly explained but at the same time hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is a big joke and I enjoyed it as such.

            "content": "I don't often watch series which end up giving me a final impression which is miles apart from the initial one. Mayoiga,  however, did just that. To say it caught me by surprise could well be an understatement. \r\n[STORY: 7/10]\r\nBefore this series aired, there were lots of expectations piling on it. No surprise there, as its director is very same one who gave us Another, Blood-C and Shirobako, while the script supervisor boasted works such as AnoHana and G-Tekketsu. \r\nIt was probably due to that heap of expectations, which was why most people were left disappointed at the first few episodes. This series startedoff pretty slow and, if I were to put it bluntly, there was literally no clue at the start as to what this series would actually exactly be about. But alas, that was to be its success. First, they left us confused and frustrated at the excessive conversations among the horde of characters and abrupt cliffhangers at the end of each episode. But then they threw at us unexpected revelations and some (attempted) plot twists which we never thought would happen because we had all concluded beforehand that this would be a 'bad series'.\\n\\n\r\nAmidst the eerie cloud of mystery and attempted horror they planted in the course of the series, it served to and did teach us a very simple principle of everyday life. What this principle is, I'll leave you to find out for yourself!\\n\\n\r\n[ART: 7/10]\\n\\n\r\nNot much qualms on this aspect. \\n\\n\r\nBrought to us by a rather experienced studio in Diomedea, the art would've been expected to be rather decent, which was what it is. There was no excessive use of scenery visuals, and the character designs were good enough to make them look cool or cute if they need to be. \\n\\n\r\n[SOUND: 7/10]\\n\\n\r\nOP was upbeat and catchy, ED was calm and soothing... Just what you'd need at the beginning and end of a suspense/mystery series, don't you? Apart from that, there is not much in the soundtrack, with the background music being mostly the same and consistent throughout. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTERS: 6/10]\\n\\n\r\nThis is where it's tough to actually give an accurate score. \\n\\n\r\nGiving a small group of characters some sort of character development within a one-cour (11-13 episodes) series is hard. This is evident in most harems, where the girls usually get their own arcs consisting of a few episodes at most. Now, if the aforementioned is difficult enough, just think about how you're going to give character development to 30 characters within that same amount of time. Simply mission impossible. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I'm going to give a fair bit of credit to Mayoiga for this because sure it was hard, but they gave it their best shot. Some of the characters had backstories revealed, which did allow us to understand why they were there in the first place and the reason for their behaviors. The happenings were rushed, but good enough to make me forgive them for it. In other words, they did all they could to give the characters some sort of development, most apparently seen in the main guy (Mitsumune). \\n\\n\r\nI actually kinda started off hating every single character in the series, but as I watched on my hate for them decreased. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT: 7/10]\\n\\n\r\nNot thoroughly enjoyed, but it kept my eyes glued to the screen, particularly towards the end of the series. Conversations between characters can be pretty funny and enjoyable to watch at times, while the intrigue and mysteriousness of the series made me want to know more and find out what the living hell was actually going on. Props to the series for being able to make me do that. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL: 7/10]\\n\\n\r\nWell, what more can I say? The series looked good before it aired, looked bad after it aired for a few weeks, but ended up being a rather decent anime I actually didn't regret spending time on. The brilliance of this series served as a grim reminder to me never to judge a book by its cover. \\n\\n\r\nTo all those who are even thinking about starting this, I suggest you ignore all the negative reviews and try it for yourself. And if you do try it, remember to try your best not to drop the series halfway. Because you never know, you might just grow to like it, like me.",

            "content": "Mayoiga is one of those anime I just had to review. I\u2019ve never had something intrigue me to this extent.\r\nThis show has one of the lowest ratings I have ever come across on this website, sitting at approximately a 5.6 as of reviewing this. That wouldn\u2019t be low by my standards but MAL in general has an inflated average rating due to various factors. People who only rate things 10, people who cannot look at anime unbiasedly and will rate everything they watch highly, and people with extremely skewed rating systems who treat a 7 as average, are some bad rating habits I see inabundance on this site. But I digress.\\n\\n\r\nThe point is, I was specifically searching for an anime with a score below 6 for my 2019 Anime Watching Challenge, and it was surprisingly really difficult. This was the only anime in the top 600 most popular on the site with a score under a 6. That\u2019s pretty astounding to me.\\n\\n\r\nNow the question is, is this show really that bad?\\n\\n\r\nMy answer is, it\u2019s not good at all, in fact it\u2019s pretty bad, but I\u2019ve seen much worse things with significantly higher ratings.\\n\\n\r\nIn premise, this show is interesting and had potential to be really good. The premise was pretty similar to Another, which is a show I absolutely hated, but I feel it wanted to take Another\u2019s ideas and do something more creative with them. One of my main complaints about Another is that it relied on being gory and having shock value rather than telling a good narrative, and I found the narrative it did try to tell was something I\u2019d heard a million times before. Mayoiga avoids doing this, and had potential for a much more compelling narrative and be one of anime\u2019s most captivating horrors/mysteries, but my god, the writing is some of the worst I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nYou have a tour bus filled with people who want to escape their real lives and start over in the mysterious Nanaki village. It wouldn\u2019t be too far-fetched to call this group of people a cult. They all refer to each other by online pseudonyms and have the same obsession with this village being a sort of saviour to them, and a desire to figuratively kill their past selves. They\u2019re essentially outcasts from society, and most behaving in ways that are frankly not appropriate, with some of them having more of a reason to feel and be that way than others. Their idea is dumb, but they\u2019re so caught up in the fantasy of it that the logistics don\u2019t really matter to them. So that\u2019s the first major thing I really liked about this show. The cultish aspect of it. I love reading real life stories about cults doing ridiculous things like this \u2013 it happens. I mean look at Heaven\u2019s Gate, Charles Manson, etc. People do terrible and dangerous things when it\u2019s treated almost as a religion to do so.\\n\\n\r\nThen you have the village itself. GPSs and compasses don\u2019t work there, and there\u2019s said to be some kind of paranormal or mythical element to the village that causes this. This isn\u2019t too far off from the real life Bermuda Triangle which has similar supernatural explanations for its occurrences, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other places similar that I don\u2019t know about. The fact that the village never been recorded on a map is pretty far-fetched however, but that\u2019s a stupid nitpick for a show with a fantasy/folklore basis. This is the other element I really liked, because I love paranormal theories for weird occurrences, whilst fully acknowledging that in real life, most of it is disproven pseudoscience. That doesn\u2019t make it any less of a fun concept to explore, especially in fictitious media.\\n\\n\r\nNow to add to what I already liked about the village, you then have how the paranormality materialises, which is the thing I absolutely love and had potential to be really damn scary and creative. Your own innermost fears or psychological scars manifest themselves in physical form, called Nanaki, and it only haunts you specifically. You have to conquer your own fear to leave the village. In leaving behind your Nanaki, however, you lose part of yourself, as it\u2019s made up of your own memories and emotions. You have to accept it to fully get rid of it. It\u2019s a really great idea on paper.\\n\\n\r\nBut\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen a show take a concept and a basis so solid, that has so much to work with and potential to be absolutely phenomenal, and write it as badly as Mayoiga does. Most badly written shows I\u2019ve seen were doomed from the start because they were either clich\u00e9, boring or there was something inherently about the plot that didn\u2019t work. Given this is original, therefore had no source material to work from, I\u2019m not sure how the team outlined a bunch of ideas that could\u2019ve been used so well, then went into script writing and made an absolute mockery of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe first major problem this show has is the sheer amount of characters it introduces from the very start. Writing 101 is to start with and centre the story around as few characters as possible and add in more as you go along as necessary. This show throws all of the characters at you at once, and tries to develop all of them, to varying degrees of success. The show would\u2019ve been better with less than half of the characters, giving them all chance to be explored properly. This issue then leads into the next major one.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is this show\u2019s dialogue? At times it comes across as satire because it\u2019s so badly written. Honestly, it\u2019s basically unintentional humour. It\u2019s not quite as bad as something like Citrus, but it\u2019s up there. There\u2019s too many characters, all trying to engage in a conversation, who each have unique quirks and traits, and the show focuses way more on trying to make these personalities noteworthy and distinctive than having actual impactful dialogue that conveys a meaningful message to the viewers. Most scenes that are supposed to come across as tense or climatic, come across as melodramatic and silly because of this. It seems like a complete lack of tonal awareness on the writers\u2019 part.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue also leads probably my biggest issue with the show. There\u2019s way too much dialogue. Everything is exposition. You do not need your entire cast of 30 characters to explain what\u2019s going on at all time. Giving everyone a chance to speak means these exposition scenes go on for minutes at a time, which led to the majority of the anime being people standing around talking to one another. The already addressed bad dialogue makes this problem even worse than it should be.\\n\\n\r\nI do think the characters, story and dialogue improve a bit as the show goes on, but not enough to make it good. It was still a step in the right direction, nonetheless, as I only expected the show to get worse as it progressed. It gave us a glimpse into what the show could\u2019ve been if the writing was better. The issue of too much exposition never alleviated however. Unfortunately, the writing dips again in the last couple of episodes, and it\u2019s mostly nonsense from there on out.\\n\\n\r\nThe last major issue this show had was the way the animators chose to animate certain scenes. I\u2019m usually not a huge critic of animation. I\u2019ve watched and enjoyed some shows with pretty average or even unimpressive visuals; it usually doesn\u2019t have a huge impact on my enjoyment. Here, however, it did. It wasn\u2019t the style of animation, as I think that\u2019s fine. It was choices in how to stage certain scenes, mainly the scenes that were supposed to be frightening or shocking. Things that should in theory be horrifying like the plush penguin amalgamation and the weird silicone spider, looked goofy and honestly pretty funny because of the animation choices. The Penguin felt like it was going for something similar to Photoshop Flowey from Undertale, and that scared the shit out of me the first time I played that game. I find weird mangled body horror eldritch abominations absolutely terrifying personally, but there was something off about the penguin and pretty much every monster in this show that made it not scary in spite of that, and a lot of it seemed to do with the choice of framing, music to go along with these scenes and the way these things were chosen to be animated, including bad use of CGI for some. I can\u2019t really pin-point it other than that, it was just missing something.\\n\\n\r\nSpeedstar\u2019s grandma was the only monster that I found actually creepy, and in episode 9  when she slams her hand against the bus, it actually managed to make me jump as it completely threw me off guard. The whole backstory with regards to his grandma in the attic was pretty dumb however, but honestly, that\u2019s one of the least of this anime\u2019s issues in terms of writing. Let\u2019s not talk about the direction the animation ends up taking for that one though, it\u2019s laughable\u2026. Honestly, the ultimate form or whatever you want to call it of Speedstar\u2019s Nanaki is one of the goofiest looking things I\u2019ve ever seen. It looks like something my 12 year old self would\u2019ve made on the Bamzooki creator.\\n\\n\r\nI've heard this show several times referred to as intentionally campy or satire and I'd buy that if we were talking about the first 3-5 episodes. Everything after that takes itself too seriously for me to believe that, and therefore if it is satire, it performs the job very ineffectively. When satire becomes indistinguishable from that its trying to critique, it just contributes to the problem. In Mayoiga's case, it doesn't do anything different to other horror anime to make it seem like an effective parody. There's so many campy western horror movies who do the job so much better, and if this was Mayoiga intention, it really should've taken its inspiration from somewhere other than just anime.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarise, Mayoiga had a great premise and terrible execution, but in my opinion, it\u2019s still better than all the shows I\u2019ve seen that managed to be awful on both fronts. It\u2019s a show I really wanted to like, had it have been in the hands of a more capable writer. Despite this, I still actually enjoyed Mayoiga a lot, and to me, this show emphasises the idea that you don\u2019t need to think something is good to get enjoyment out of it. It didn\u2019t feel like a total slog to get through unlike most other shows I rated under a 5, and I think that in itself is worthy of merit.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry you had to suffer this fate, Mayoiga. You deserved better.",

In fact, I wasn't remotely aware of anything about this anime or I wouldn't have watched it. Consider this a warning.\r\nThe Lost Village starts with an enormous cast and some serious Lost (the famous TV series) vibes. It ends abruptly, with very few answers and everyone alive*. Between these two points, the character basically argue and manipulate each other in childish ways, instead of actually paying attention to their surroundings and wondering how come this place had anything they could possibly need to survive, besides someserious infrastructure, which implies it was accessible by train and bus, which means it was, at some point, on a map.\\n\r\nI point out this nitpicky bit of information because it is the least spoilery thing I can use in order to say the obvious thing about this series: everyone in it is dumb. Some are dumber than others, but you couldn't make a single smart person by pooling all 30 of them together. And do you know what kind of stories have a large cast of dumb people? B horror movies.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is how you should treat this anime, if you intend to watch it at all. As a B horror movie filled with dumb people, unintended humor and moments in which said people make The Worse Decision. Sadly, unlike B horror movie people, the cast's bad decisions hardly ever hurt them or anyone near them. It just makes them argue some more. \\n\\n\\n\r\n* Is it wrong that I longed for the death of half the cast?",

            "content": "I've been watching a lot of anime lately, and stumbled upon Myoiga somehow. It was sitting in my \"Plan to watch\" list for a while. The ratings/reviews seemed  daunting, but I took a gamble, and I'm glad I did. Right from the beginning, I was impressed with animation and sound work. The music was very complimenting to the scenes. As it progressed, I liked the physiological aspects quite a bit. The story was fresh, and kept me interested until the end. The feeling of never knowing what might happen next was quite inviting. You also get an emotionalunderstanding of some of the characters. I was really able to empathize, and  shed a few tears in the process ! \\n\\n\r\n       Now, a good review has to include the negative aspects. To avoid spoilers for the first one, I'll just say \"The Secret of Nanaki village.\" Some of these \"Secrets\" were animated in a cheesy manner, and didn't accomplish what their intended purpose was. The story also had some issues. More could have been done to explain setting, but more importantly, the ending seemed rushed. It didn't include much resolution, and definitely was not as satisfying as it could have been.  \\n\\n\r\n       All and all, Myoiga isn't for everyone, but I definitely enjoyed it. If you want a mystery style anime with a little romance, action, and emotional character stories, it is a good short watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 7.5/10. Not quite an 8, but that .5 is well deserved.",

            "content": "I think when a lot of people, myself included, started watching this show they expected it to be a lot more like Another. Another being a show where, spoiler alert, practically everyone dies at the end except for a couple of the main characters. This was due to the large cast, the ominous atmosphere presented in the first couple episodes and the fact that it was actually directed by the same guy as Another. I mean the obvious direction for this show would be to slowly kill off side characters until a couple were remaining.\r\nHowever this is not the direction Mayoiga took. Instead it startedto delve into themes of trauma and psychological scars. It slowly became apparent that this was not going to be horror, it was turning into a drama.\\n\\n\r\nAnd did this direction work?\\n\\n\r\nWell yes and no.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the problems with this anime was that it tried to do way too much in such a short period of time. There were far too many characters and simply not enough time to develop them properly. Backstories were presented and then never brought up again. We learn the stories behind Nyanta, Mikage and Lovepon and these stories are never brought up again. These characters do not change and don\u2019t get any closure. \\n\\n\r\nNow this isn\u2019t true for everyone. Mitsumune, Hayato, Masaki and the bus driver (who really needed a name by the way, what was up with that?) all developed as characters and this was done well. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself also left a lot to be desired. I mean it made no sense at some points. The Koharun twist at the end came out of nowhere. The pacing was horrendous, I mean it took forever to get to point and a lot of information was presented within the last three episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall when you really look at it this show was pretty terrible. \\n\\n\r\n However it had its moments. There were some pretty funny moments with a lot of the side characters like Lovepon and Nyanta. The puns were great. There were some genuinely touching moments like with the bus driver and his daughter. I personally found Hayato\u2019s development to be interesting. Even Masaki, who I didn\u2019t like at all when I started this show, ended up being kind of interesting. Even the main character, Misumune, turned out to be good.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s definitely not a bad concept. The idea of facing psychological scars and acknowledging trauma and not just running away from problems is a great theme. The execution wasn\u2019t the best but it was a good theme.\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga may not hold up from a critical standpoint but it definitely was fun to watch and I\u2019m glad I stuck with it.",

            "content": "Okay, where do I start with Mayoiga? For many it was a disappointment as they were expecting a suspenseful and thrilling anime, for others who went in with little expectations weren\u2019t surprised with its content. The series manages to make people laugh more then be intrigued, which isn\u2019t a good thing for any anime labeled as a \u201cmystery\u201d and \u201chorror\u201d, because the only thing I found a mystery was the fact that someone actually greenlit this anime and the only thing that\u2019s horrific is its poor writing and characterization. But hey, you might get a couple of good laughs from this series, because unintentional comedyis better than nothing.\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nWell, Mayoiga has a pretty good premise. The story starts off with a large cast of characters all in a bus that are on a journey to find a lost village that they\u2019ve heard about. The group finds the village, but can\u2019t find a way out. It\u2019s a pretty cool premise for what seemed to be a horror series. Little did I know that there was no horror\u2026 or suspense\u2026 or thrills\u2026 or anything that is remotely enjoyable. Mayoiga turns into a mess fairly early, as it\u2019s really hard to know what\u2019s going on. I mean, the story is fairly straightforward, but it\u2019s just so absurd that you can\u2019t comprehend its stupidity. Characters have the logic of a two-year old and supernatural aspect of the series becomes so abysmal that it\u2019s hard not to be irritated by this series. That being said, the series did have potential. The premise was interesting enough, and maybe if they lore of the village was done well, and maybe if the backstories were alright, it wouldn\u2019t have been so bad. And talking about the backstories, there are some in the series, and they are so bad and so atrocious that it\u2019s hard not to laugh when something really \u201ctragic\u201d is happening. I never thought that I would laugh at traumatized characters, but some of them are traumatized by the most stupid things. By the end of the series, I just wanted to see a massacre and see all the characters dead. At least the series would become more interesting. But the ending is so anticlimactic and so disappointing, that it only made the series look worse. \\n\r\nStory: 1.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nProbably the worst thing about Mayoiga is that it doesn\u2019t do what you would\u2019ve wanted it to do. One would expect the series to be suspenseful and frightening, or at least try to do so. Instead the only entertainment found in the series is its unintentional comedy. The storyline and the characters are so washed out and ridiculous that it\u2019s really hard to take things seriously. The tone is never really stable, with the reason being that nothing gets completely accomplished. The atmosphere feels lacking, the characters don\u2019t react properly to certain situations, and there\u2019s not much to the plot. Therefore, the ominous tone they were trying to create was never created at all. And the pacing of the series didn\u2019t help either. The plot doesn\u2019t really go anywhere till the very end, and by the time it actually moves, you couldn\u2019t care less about it. But that\u2019s not the worst part of Mayoiga. \\n\r\nPresentation: 1/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nThe worst part of this series is its characters. My god, they\u2019re so, so stupid and dumbed-down. They can make the most stupid choices for the most stupid reasons. In the unintentional comedy is what makes this series enjoyable, it\u2019s the characters that take the enjoyment away from this series. Mayoiga features a large cast of characters, a really large cast. It was compared to Baccano and Durarara before it started, due to a large number of people on its key visual. Some worried that not all characters will be properly developed or will be fully explored. The problem is that none of the characters get any development at all. Instead they all get negative development (is that even a term) as they only become more and more unlikable and they were better off the way they were at the beginning of this series. Our protagonist, Mitsumune is such a by-the-book protagonist. He\u2019s that nice and kind main character who wants the best of everyone. He lacks the intelligence of choosing sides and he lacks the courage to stop other people from picking on him. Though his backstory isn\u2019t too bad, especially when compared to the other characters. Since it\u2019ll be inefficient of me of listing all of the characters in the series and explaining what\u2019s wrong with them, I\u2019ll summarize them all by one phrase: they\u2019re stupid, irritating, lack common logic and makes choices that are cringe-worthy. Also, screw Love-pon\u2026\\n\r\nCharacter: 0.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe art in Mayoiga is fairly neat and clean, but nothing too special. The backgrounds are strictly okay and the detailing is good enough. The use of lighting in the series is fairly good as the night scenes look quite good. Most of the series does take place in the dark. Though the character designs in the series is mediocre to say the least. They look clean and neat, but they lack key features in their designs that can make them memorable. The characters look simplistic in design. Although that may not necessarily be a bad thing, but it\u2019s just that the characters a so zero-dimensional (not even one) that at least the character designs could have done something.to make the characters feel something more. And also, some of the characters look similar to one another. But luckily the characters never change their clothes so it\u2019s not too bad in differentiating them. \\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nMayoiga\u2019s animation quality is fairly good for the most part. It\u2019s quite fluid and clean and there\u2019s not many moments when the studio cut corners. The production values are quite high for this series and the studio did a good job in making the series look good. That being said, the CGI used in some moments of the series is quite awful. CGI is normally used more \u201cmonster-looking\u201d things and it doesn\u2019t look good. They\u2019re supposed to look hideous by its design, not by its CGI. The CGI looked messy and didn\u2019t properly merge with the hand drawn work in the series. Other than that, the animations in the series stays fairly consistent. \\n\r\nAnimation: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Mayoiga is quite average as nothing really stands out from this series. Most of the seiyuu feel like they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re told to do and none of them go beyond the script. Though I can\u2019t really blame them for not doing more than what the script tells them to do, because it\u2019s hard to be enthusiastic while working on Mayoiga. But hey, at least they managed to make follow the script\u2026 by making the characters as irritating as possible. The cast of seiyuu is pretty unknown as I haven\u2019t heard about many of them until I watched this series. But it\u2019s not like Mayoiga will boost their career. Although, Love-pon\u2019s seiyuu did a fairly decent job in making her character irritating as hell (I\u2019ll give her props for that). \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music of Mayoiga is a mixed bag, as the OP and ED manages to be fairly good, but the background music is lacking in every way. The OP, \u201cGensou Drive\u201d is pretty good and catchy too. The vocals are really well done, though the music is average. The ED, \u201cKetsuro\u201d is probably better than the OP as the vocals and the music managed to grab my attention. At least I had something to look forward to whenever I watched an episode of Mayoiga. The backgrounf music on the other hand isn\u2019t very good. For a horror/mystery, the music plays a key factor in creating thrills and frills. When to add music and when to keep it silent is a key factor for these genres. Unfortunately, Mayoiga lacks these skill, but then again, was the anime a horror-mystery to begin with?\\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nWell, I can\u2019t say that I completely hated Mayoiga. There is some entertainment to be found in this mess. The unintentional comedy, at times, can really make you laugh. The situations the characters go through are so absurd and so abysmal that you can\u2019t help but laugh at their tragedy. However, there moments where the series just feels plain irritating, particularly because of its characters. Watching them making stupid decisions for stupid reasons gets irritating fast, and it makes the series hard to watch at times. And the fact that the series lacked real suspense and horror made this anime a grind to watch. Maybe it would\u2019ve been more enjoyable if the entire cast died in a massacre. That would\u2019ve been great actually!\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Mayoiga is recommended to the strongest masochists who can stand the stupidity of this anime. The characters are so irritating and so dumb, that it\u2019s painful to see them interact with one another. And their backstories feel like big jokes. It\u2019s hard to sympathize with any of the characters, and that ruins the purpose of this series. Don\u2019t go into this thinking that you\u2019ll get a horror or a suspense anime, because you will no. You won\u2019t get anything that is remotely close to that. The anime was disappointing enough for me to put this studio in my \u201cbeware-of-their-work\u201d list (and I\u2019m scared to see how Handa-kun turns out to be). Maybe Mayoiga can turn into a meme so at least it would have a reason for its existence. \\n\\n\r\n+ Production values are good enough. \\n\r\n- Some of the most poorly written and irritating characters you\u2019ll ever see.\\n\r\n- Never feels like a mystery or a horror, but rather creates unintentional comedy.\\n\r\n- Premise is wasted by an uninteresting plot and poor execution. \\n\r\n- Haphazard pacing and slow plot progression only makes it worse. \\n\r\n- Ending feels anticlimactic and underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3.1/10",

MITSUMUNE, seriously if he can drop his friend that easily over a girl hes only just met then he really shouldnt have hayato let alone anybody as a friend, hayato did genuinely care about mitsumune and that was made clear by the ending when he accepted his nanaki and admitted that mitsumune gave him confidence and freedom which is how this should of went from the start instead of making him appear selfish and manipulative\\n\\n\r\n30 ppl in a 12 episode anime...needless to say over half of them didnt get a single bit of development and the ones that did were absolutely dreadful minus mitsumunes and the rest were bland and just oh well that sucks\\n\\n\r\nthe ending was pointlessly dragged out and by the end more then half stayed behind for the most bullcrap reasons and less then half left with some common sense, your in a place where your deepest fears manifest as monsters that is still very unknown and still needs alot of research to be done about it and trust the lady who was manipulating you this whole time, yea makes total sense\\n\\n\r\non a side note jack was another wasted character, he was my favorite simply because he didnt take anyones crap and was willing to kill a bastard for trying to bully him, yes a bit of an over reaction but if you been bullied your entire life and finally snap you have nobody to blame but the ppl that pushed them to it, i understood jacks situation from being bullied and snapping in such a way myself however they went on to portray him as a serial killer and villain, basically portraying a victim of extreme bullying who retaliates will go on to be a serial killer and betray everybody, seriously wtf?\\n\\n\r\nwhat should have happened was jack was simply fed up and defending himself, when he got out instead of becoming a psycho killer he just simply went into hiding and was even secretly protecting them this whole time or just hiding out scared, later on when hes found they eventually prove hes a good person and innocent and he re joins the group but nope they had to make him evil and stupidly make him actually work with the other jack who he previously was trying to kill because he messed with him, like wtf? seriously WASTE of a good character and horrible portrayal of what victims of bullying are really like, their not crazy serial killers, they are FED UP with being a punching bag and striking back which others see it as an act of an insane person its really an act of self defense, when ppl snap their not thinking rationally their acting out of fear and pent up anger from being bullied so long, but enough of that i just really their portrayal of that\\n\\n\r\noverall enjoyment was really 1 but i rate it 2/10 simply cuz the art and animation wasnt terrible and a few likeable characters\\n\\n\r\ni actually did like a few characters even though they ruined the potentially good ones if you ignored their bs portrayal you can still see where the characters were good at and if i had to choose a different main character it would be hayato hands down and cut the yandere bullcrap, story had promise but was executed as absolute garbage, characters had potential that was wasted and others just simply served no purpose at all, art was decent and had variety atleast, music isnt bad but easily forgettable, enjoyment started off high then ended in an all time low, want my advice? DONT WATCH IT unless just to laugh at how bad it is, seriously just skip it and go to corpse party or something\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mayoiga is a show with a rocky start that continues down the path of mediocrity.\r\nStory (5) - Perhaps the only thing Mayoiga had going for it was the story, and only for the first few episodes. The idea of a group trying to restart their lives in a new place is intriguing, and if it continued as slice of life, perhaps it would've stayed good. Unfortunately, it decided to take a 'mysterious, supernatural' turn for the worst. Thus spawning forced drama, boring and unfocused conversations between lifeless characters, and extreme absurdity.\r\nCharacters (4) - It tries to have a psychological element that just ends up fallingflat on it's face. In order to have a successful psychological story, there needs to be characters that are fleshed out enough for the audience to understand their thoughts and feelings. Here, we have nothing but stereotypical sob stories for not one, but multiple characters that create no actual emotions.\\n\\n\r\nOut of a cast of about 30 characters, half of which are forgotten shortly after the first few minutes of the first episode, only about 10 or so of them get proper backstories. And even then, they are crammed into short spouts of the show. For the majority of them, the backstory never even resurfaces! The main character is the only one fleshed out, and that's after getting half way through the show. He is perhaps the only one that gets the proper treatment, and even then the ending isn't conclusive. There is not closure, making the show feel even more of a waste than before.\\n\\n\r\nArt (3) - Nothing extravagant. There is use of CG in parts that look trite and, quite honestly, ruin any possible immersion.\\n\\n\r\nSound (4) - Four is for Forgettable. Not a single track worth mentioning, not even the opening or ending.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6) - Perhaps I'm being too kind, but there's a part of me that was entertained. After deciding not to take it too seriously, the show became something to laugh at. It should be watched with a drinking game attached. For instance, a shot every time a character goes crazy/says something irrational for no reason. Every time a CG blob appears. Every time there's a backstory. That's the only possible way to enjoy this garbage.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5) - This is not something to watch seriously. It's something to have fun with. Something to laugh at. Something that highlights all the things anime shouldn't be. There are too many characters, a poorly executed and dumb story, and a disappointing ending. The way to said ending is dull. There's no suspense or horror, and the psychological elements are anything but. It's a waste of time.",

A promising premise that could have gone into any direction, from relationship drama to Battle Royale bloodbath. Sadly, it took no route at all and kept screwing around with developments and plot twists that don't really make any sense. It also has the problem of being only 12 episodes but still trying to show stuff that could easily fill out 50 or more. In the end, itis just an incoherent mess, that barely makes sense.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt's not bad in general, but t's clearly visible that this wasn't blessed with a high budget. Which is surprising, seeing how this was Diomedeas only anime this season. Really bad however is the term I would choose for the CGI effects. Those monsters looked laughable at best, not only because of their weird nature, but also because they looked like they belong anywhere but this very anime.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOpening and Ending were pretty good, voice acting ranged from solid to good, sound effects were absolutely okay. But seriously, have you ever seen an anime with bad sound?\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI don't know what kind of characters I expected, but certainly not THIS. Besides the fact that at least half of them could have easily been left out, the ones who get some screentime are horrible. Nothing they do makes sense, the conclusions they come up with are ridiculous and the two main characters are the personifications of bland. At best, they are unintentionally funny, but this isn't supposed to be a comedy.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWatching Mayoiga did not physically hurt me...but it came dangerously close. The only way to slightly enjoy this anime is to take it as a comedy. You know, the same way some people think the Twilight movies are great comedies. I prefer actual comedies though, so this does nothing for me. I highly recommend you DON'T watch Mayoiga, that's 4 hours you'll never get back.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n2.6/10",

            "content": "I made a heavy edited video review of Mayoiga with comedic parody elements, which I spend a lot of time and effort on:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-dKqbGyv5k&list=FLy_MSrnWbF86dVyi7JZj-zw\r\nBut if you prefer reading\u2026here you go:\r\nLost Village, or Mayoiga is about what would happen, if you put 30 people from Tumblr on a deserted island and watch them argue about wether link should have a vagina or not, instead of finding food, or a way out and then watch them slowly die, because of their mental disorders\u2026woooow, everybody calm down.\r\n30 people, men and woman, kids and adults, go on a bus tour, promised to get them to a secret village, that noone knows about. Not even popos can get there. Every person has their non sensical reasons for leaving home such as, \u201cmy onii-chan doesn\u2019t like me and doesn\u2019t suck my niples every night\u201d and \u201coh no, the 8th season of my little pony has ended and I have nothing to do\u201d. Everyone is basically like, if you would take the commenters of any anime list websites. (they even introduce themselves by the internet names) You got the annoying nya, nya fuck me in the neko guy, the loli everyone will make rule 34 of and so on\u2026\\n\\n\r\nLost village actually starts of pretty decent. Despite not knowing much about the characters, which you don\u2019t care about, because you assume they will all die by the end the show anyway, it focuses more on building mystery. What does this place look like and what is it all about? What are those character going to find at the end of the road and what will happen to them? Does this village even exist? Sadly, nothing ever goes anywhere. Oh look, this guy is going to get stung in the ass by this giant bee. Just kidding, absolutely nothing happens. For the most part, you are going to watch these idiots argue among themselves, trying to decide who has the smallest dick, while some hysterical Jersey shore reject is panicking about her broken nail or something.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone comes of so stupid and there was not a single likeable character. Of course you can\u2019t expect them to give personality to all 30 individuals. But at least one acceptable character? Is that too much? They of course \u00bbTRY\u00ab to flesh out certain characters, as their try to face of their fears and being chased by bad CGI, resembling their traumas from the past, but their backstories are the most ridiculous shit I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nAlso there\u2019s a girl named Lovepon. Ohhhhh she\u2019s a special little coconut. By the true Mayoiga fashion of course, they flushed her personality down the toilet, but they did bother to make her at least one dimensional. See, she has a fetish for execution and won\u2019t shut up about it. Like ok, it\u2019s fine when she says it the first couple of times, but then she proceeds to say it again, and again, execution, execution\u2026yes please, end my life!\\n\\n\r\nAside from the CGI abominations, I actually like the art style and how some of the characters were designed. Some looked very similar and I couldn\u2019t tell them apart, although that might also be due to poor characters But I thought a few of them actually looked pretty. I can\u2019t comment too much on the animation, as it didn\u2019t strike me as anything too special, so it\u2019s all right. Also, there\u2019s isn\u2019t much to say about the soundtrack, because nothing was too memorable, but what I can comment on is the opening song. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me but besides me thinking that the song is uninspired and boring and a must skip in each viewing and that\u2019s just my personal taste, I don\u2019t mind if you like the song. I found the singing in the opening to be bad. Poor performance.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might have noticed, I don\u2019t recommend watching this show. You might be fooled for half of the show, into thinking that this might turn out ok, like I was, but trust me, it goes nowhere. I was looking forward to watching all these unlikeable characters die, I wouldn\u2019t usually say this stuff without warning, but I really think I might save you the time. No one actually dies in the entire span of 12 episodes! So what you\u2019re left with, is a cast of 30 dipshits with no personality and a bad conclusion. I feel bad for ripping on this show so badly, because people put a lot of effort into animating this, but I can\u2019t find it in me to like it. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about it. I\u2019m done. Please stay away from this shit and go watch better anime, like Ben 10 or something.\\n",

Cu'z if we're to focus on the characters individually, then we the audience would be pulled in such dark psych of being disgusted with the anime itself, don't forget the anime has a psychological genre and it doesn't play within the characters it also pulls us into as well, so, I have no problems of rating this line a 8 over 10.   \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, well just like everybody else, we expect someone to die, but that didn't occurred, nevertheless, its a 7 over 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall, was that this anime is something that one should look deep into and not someone who has a shallow mind, so if your looking for an entertaining anime were blood would be spilled, then this isn't for you......BTW, its a 8 over 10 for this anime.

            "content": "The director Tsutomu Mizushima's Another was a decent show, entertaining to watch if nothing else. Even providing the audience a good chunk of mystery and such deliciously dramatic death scenes. The problem with Another was that the mystery died when there was still a half of the season left and no one really had any idea how to spend the rest of the time. A good old beach episode? I'm in! \r\nThe problem with Mayoiga is that there is no mystery.\r\nThat's a quite peculiar premise for a mystery anime, isn't it. Of course a show doesn't exactly have to invest that much to the story,instead it can pursue developing human relationships and studying its characters. Nothing like that here. It's a wonderful thing how it's possible to pump these 12 episodes of an anime full of cliches and idiotism no one could have come up with without laughing at such ludicrous ideas. Some people, spooky surroundings, a supernatural threat, hidden scars from the past. These lost people end up in... THE LOST VILLAGE! A touching masterpiece with a great sense of delicasy. \\n\\n\r\nObviously the first thing that a seasoned watcher would consider would be the following: The creators need to be joking. Even more seasoned watcher would consider the option \u201dnot this goddamn toxic waste again\u201d. A good amount of blank characters made out of the most used and generic molds taken to a creepy village while out of nowhere people start dying? Only a few characters receive any kind of background? Such a funny way to play with us... if there were anything to support that. The first episode indeed seemed like a parody made so obvious that people would actually take it seriously. Epic and corny introductions for the crew! Singing! Gloomy omens! I tend to expect the worst from anime nowadays, so while I toyed with the thought that the terrifying monsters behind this all weren't doing it with a straight face, the answer would be the usual one. As it got more and more embarassing to watch, I still wanted and sincerely hoped that in the final episode everyone would just wake up and discard the whole thing with a \u201das if that all could have happened, it was only a dream\u201d. Mayoiga ended with no dignity at all. The joke wasn't a joke.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end Mayoiga isn't even entertaining, it's a complete bore. The opening song is not too bad and it's quite catchy, gives one bonus point to the final score because I'm nice like that. At least there's no need to mourn for the lost potential, it becomes evident that this anime was rotten to the core from the beginning. I would have rather spent the time cleaning the house, now it will never get clean and my poor soul will be lost in the dusty whirpool of awful anime.",

            "content": "[MAJOR SPOILER WARNING]\r\nHave you ever been forced to listen to an argument that you aren't a part of? That's what Mayoiga is like. \r\nMayoiga (The Lost Village) is a 12-episodes series that aired during the Spring 2016 season, and is essentially an exercise in making an audience as irritated and miserable as possible. As I said earlier, Mayoiga is a lot like listening to an argument that you aren't a part of. You aren't personally invested, you don't want to listen to them, and in that moment you probably hate everyone involved with the fighting. Due to the countless number of fuck-ups in Mayoiga, allof these also apply to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe audience at large isn't invested in the characters of Mayoiga because simply put, they're all assholes. The only thing the characters are good at doing are: 1. bitching at each other, and 2. telling the audience how they feel. The former is a problem because after about 3 episodes you've had just about enough of all of them. This script is honestly so mean-spirited that it's seriously impossible to like anyone. Did I mention Mari Okada was involved in the production? The latter is a problem because your characters are not supposed to tell the audience how they feel. You're supposed to SHOW the audience. If you're telling instead of showing when it comes to emotions you are failing as a storyteller. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of storytelling failure, the actual story of Mayoiga is garbage too. It's about a bunch of assholes who want to escape society by taking a bus to Nanaki Village, a mysterious place where they begin their lives anew. Nanaki Village itself is plagued by giant monsters called Nanaki, that are physical manifestations of the various fears and regrets of the people there. Now you might be thinking that sounds interesting, but I can assure you it is not. All of their fears boil down to stupid stuff like bees (a girl gets attacked by bees when she was little, so her greatest fear is apparently bees) or cliche crap like one character's dead daughter. Ugh. Oh, and you know why our main character, Mitsumune, left to go on the tour? Because his brother died and his mom was calling him his brother's name instead of his real name. Yeah, seriously. His mother was in a state of shock and emotional upheaval after Mitsumune's death and as a result, calls him his brother's name. Apparently dealing with this is just too much for our little Mitsumune, so he runs away from home, increasing his mother's anxiety tenfold and probably destroying her emotionally for her remaining years. This is exactly why I hate all of the characters. Their actions are very questionable, and in many instances such as this downright despicable. All Mitsumune had to do was suck it up and wait until he graduates high school and it would have been fine. Yes, he and his mother clearly needed to come to a reconciliation regarding the whole name thing, but Mitsumune needed to TALK TO HER instead of running away and making everything worse!\\n\\n\r\nAs far as visuals and music goes, well...the Nanaki themselves did look neato and the music wasn't the worst thing I've ever heard. So there's that...?\\n\\n\r\nIf you can't tell, Mayoiga is garbage. This gets my award for the worst anime of Spring 2016, which is actually quite a feat considering Big Order was airing at the same time. There is nothing here that redeems the series. The characters are annoying and unlikable, the story is mean-spirited and half-hearted, the visuals are uninspired outside of the Nanaki themselves, and the music is repetitive and terrible. \\n\\n\r\nDo not watch Mayoiga. \\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 1/10",

This show mostly involved the psychological issues of the characters, in terms of emotions and thoughts, and the troublesome beings that they have created as a result of those issues. The character with the most psychological issues, emotional and thoughtful confusion, and probably my favorite character while watching this show, was myself. Honestly, dafuq did I watch?\\n\\n\r\nWhat did surprise me though was seeing a mixture of Toshio from the grudge and a Mawaru Penguindrum penguin. The show also surprised me with some Yugioh and Angel Beats vibes in the end.\\n\\n\r\nI might have not enjoyed this for the reason that I was expecting either a Texas Chainsaw Massacre or a full-on ghost mystery or even something like Scooby-Doo with a definite culprit but less childish.\\n\\n\r\nIf u read this review, I will reccommend watching it but don't expect much. Maybe u will enjoy it better than I did.\\n\\n\r\nIma be generous and give this a 5/10",

The thing about nanaki is confusing, like  how the people at Nanaki village could all see Reiji even if he wasn't their nanaki. The conclusion was much worse than I expected. The last few episodes were a little boring and the last episode was rushed.\r\nArt 7/10\r\nThe art was decent. I liked the fog effects but most of the nanaki were not very \"anime like\" compared to the monsters in other animes. The characters were pretty good.\r\nSound 7/10\r\nThe audio of the last episodewas out of sync and messed up. Opening and ending like typical anime openings and endings, nothing really special. The best audio part probably the hippo song kyaaa~\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\r\nMitsume seems way too gullible. There are too many characters and most of them aren't really necessary. Many of them lack common sense. For example, Nettaiya brought high heels because she said the only shoes she had were high heel. Seriously, can't she just go buy some shoes that are more fit for walking? \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nThe cliffhangers were really exciting. The whole anime itself could have been much better. Koharun's motive behind bringing all these people into Nanaki Village was pretty interesting. It was also pretty interesting how Lion said she knows when people are about to die, except that the anime didn't really go into that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\nMayoiga was pretty confusing overall.

            "content": "I was kind of looking forward to Mayoiga, I love horror/suspense and anime from my past experience has been able to do the genre some justice. Shows like Another and Death Note have always been some of my favorite animes and I really wanted more anime's like them to be released. So I was happy to welcome a new Horror/Suspense anime into the line up. But from the first episode Mayoiga showed that it was definitely not going to be anything like I thought...\r\nMayoiga has to be one of the BIGGEST disappointments in anime for me, I was doing some research before the anime airedand saw the plot was about a group of people seeking a place to start over and live their life again. That sounded pretty interesting to me and for the first 2 episodes it was. However once they got there and they started revealing the \"secrets\" behind this place I started laughing. I'm not gonna spoil the secrets incase you still (for some strange reason) want to give this anime a shot) but the plot had to be one of the most random and unorganized plots i've ever seen. The plot kept jumping back and forth between what their goals were and by the end of it all it was one giant mess. I honestly want to know what was going through their minds when they made the plot for this cause it made no sense whatsoever, it starts off good and quickly turns into a burning pile of trash.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the most uninteresting characters I have ever seen. NONE of them actually felt like humans, especially the main 2. You know they're boring when I had to search up both their names while writing this because I forgot. Mitsumune was one of the dullest and generic anime characters i've ever seen. The kid did not even seem human he had the exact reaction to everything and was so boring. The only reason I remember anything about his past is because it made me laugh so hard when we meet his \"fear.\" (more on that later.) I honestly remember nothing about Masaki, she had importance in like one episode and besides that just kind of followed Mitsumune around like a puppy until the last few episodes. These characters were so boring and only played a role in the plot near the end of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"Horror\" of this anime was the best part of this anime. Not because it was scary or thrilling, but because it was so bad, it makes you laugh. These \"beasts\" we're suppose to be scared of are ridiculous and laughable. They're suppose to resemble something from their pasts that they're running from but nothing, not even the back stories, was scary or suspenseful. It was just a bunch of failures who failed once in life and decided \"I want to start over instead of making an continuing on with their lives\". Mitsumune had the saddest back story of them all, but the \"monster\" ruined it for me. It was so goofy looking that everytime I saw it instead of feeling sad about his past I could only laugh at how ridiculous it was.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, Don't watch Mayoiga. If you want horror / suspense you wont find it here. Don't watch it if you want intersting characters, because you wont find it here. However, You want a good laugh at how poorly made an anime can be? You've come to the right place. The only reason i'd recommend this is just to sit down with your buddies and have a good chuckle at how bad this anime is.",

            "content": "This is a hard one to write about without giving spoilers so expect them later on in the review (don't worry I'll tell you when they are coming). The reason it is so hard not to write spoilers when reviewing Mayoiga is that the main reason I like this anime so much is that it is awesomely weird and if I explain anything of significance about it I will be spoiling the fun of experiencing this weirdness 'cold'. Weirdness is mainly appealing because it shocks you. It isn't as fun when the weirdness is explained away right? So watch it if you like to besurprised by an anime...and now onto the\\n\\n\r\nSPOLIERS...You still don't know if you want to watch it? Well let me try and sell you on it, this anime had an elephant sized silicon boob monster...See I told you this was an awesome anime. Argument over. The end. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAhem, ok but come on what is not to like about an elephant sized silicon boob monster? Anyway apart from that weirdness the anime has a huge cast of 30 plus characters most of who introduce themselves and list their reason for being there no matter how inane or crazy in the first episode. I watched this episode without knowing anything about it and at first was diligently paying close attention, by the tenth person I was getting a bit lost wondering who had said what and if any of it was vitally important and by the 20th or so I was laughing and letting the whole thing wash over me. I had left my eidetic memory in my other pants that day so yeah keeping track of what everyone had said and their motivations was a little impossible. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole anime is filled with tropes and with completely illogical actions by the characters. So yeah it is like pretty much every other anime...but seriously Mayoiga takes it to a whole other level and makes it funny. These characters are super pumped about uncovering a witch then forget about it completely and go to sleep. They lock up people then just leave them there to rot and forget about them. There is a character who calls herself Love-pon who wants to kill anyone and everyone and will scream at the top of her lungs to \"execute\" anyone who looks at her funny at roughly 5 second intervals whenever she is on screen.\\n\\n\r\nI can understand the confusion that occurs when discussing this anime. The volatile nature of the scores mostly seem to be either very low or very high with few in between. Is this thing a misunderstood masterpiece or a steaming pile? Probably the first thing but not sure...anyway it was extremely entertaining. I can't even say that it was so bad it was good because there is some story here, it is not a complete farce (well mostly it is but there is a story in there which is actually kind of heartfelt and sweet). \\n\\n\r\nSo uh in summary this is a Lord of the Flies with coolly weird monster ghost things that has a warm and fuzzy story (eventually) that made me laugh a lot and was quite clever and subtle in places (not the boob monster part) and was completely stupid (still not the boob monster part) in other places. I enjoyed the roller coaster ride.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I very rarely give \"10\"s, but after completing all 12 episodes of Mayoiga, I felt it deserved both the rating and a review. I was hooked from first reading the plot description and thus was confused by the poor rating and mixed reviews. I still do not understand why the rating is so low. Mayoiga had me constantly guessing the entire time--it took all 12 episodes to wrap up the mystery, which I found to be quite compelling and thrilling. The premise initially seemed fairly original to me, but developed into something more complex and much more enjoyable. I found myself on the edge ofmy seat during the entire duration of the show due to the pacing and unpredictability. I would have loved to have seen the backstories of all 30 characters, as the ones shown added to the characters' complexity and made me more sympathetic to some particularly annoying characters. While the main characters occasionally lacked depth and seemed rather annoying at points, the relationships of the side characters and unpredictability of the show's direction drove me to keep watching. The music gave the show the right mood and added to the unsettling vibe. I don't usually like creepy shows, but the innocent animation style and comical actions of the characters made the occasional gruesome monsters and creepy soundtrack digestible. If you're looking for a thrilling mystery that you won't see coming (you really will not anticipate the direction of this show at all, but unlike other reviewers, I really enjoyed it) I highly recommend Mayoiga!",

Things look like they get a little crazy for them. Maybe, this will be good mindtrip. So I started to watch and it drew me in, but then it ended, one or two episodes early IMO. I even backed out to double check, there weren't anymore. Then, I realized,I didn't really care anyways. That's how I felt after this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show was just BLAND on all aspects.

The large cast helped to add believable environments, especially one of the first sequences when introducing themselves on the bus ride to the Lost Village; it`s a bit nerve-racking but it`s alive like group settings with strangers in an ice-breaker.\r\nMusic\r\nThe ED Theme \"Condensation (Ketsuro \u7d50\u9732)\" by Rina Katahira is a quiet sad tune that plays over some boring stills in the EDVisuals, it was nice to relax to, however not special enough to purchase.\\n\\n\r\nCONS - \\n\\n\r\nWriting\\n\\n\r\nThere are way too many characters and many of them are used to add more specialty to the main cast when everyone turns for or against them. A bit of a spoiler but it`s funny how a few characters want to rip the others' guts out, towards the end, then suddenly become friendly in a second. \\n\\n\r\nNobody here is exactly special either, except for a few such as the Detective and the background of our lead character (forgot their names already, haha).\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, BGM mixes in the back so well (good and bad) that I can hardly appreciate it in a film, anime, and etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is a predictable J-Rock tune that made me think, \"Oh it`s probably gonna get bloody like Shiki, (Mayoiga is nothing like that)\" when hearing Shiki`s Faylan OP 2.\\n\\n\r\nDirecting\\n\\n\r\nThere is some disgusting 3D CGI.\\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga is a bit sad, it`s relatable to life, though, it didn`t do the best job at it.\\n\\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nEssential Watching?: No, but it provides a relatable experience. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The story is enough to engage your curiosity but it is underdeveloped, the aftermath is unrealistic and the show overall fails at creating build-up. They are way too many cut scenes and by the last few episodes you'll find yourself getting seriously annoyed. \r\nCharacter- 1: The main problem with this show is that it introduces AT LEAST 30 characters which is insanely stupid considering that the shows is only 12 episodes. It's virtually impossible to become emotionally attached to anyof them considering the amount of screen time each character gets. I can guarantee 70% of the characters will piss you off. Oh and it also took me ten minutes to confirm who the main character is. \\n\\n\r\nArt- Decent. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 0.5: Huh? What sound? If you're like me and you love a good soundtrack at the more intense moments or if music is really what touches your emotions during an anime, then don't watch this show. Run while you still can. It's practically non-existent. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 2: Hey, I watched it to the end, didn't I? For twelve episodes, the plot went mind-numbingly slow. And if you thought anime logic couldn't get any worse then guess what- it totally can! As I'm writing this review I'm regretting continuing with this show. I'm questioning why I finished it... \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 2: In conclusion.... Try it for yourselves. If you dislike the first episode, then I can assure you will will dislike the entire series.",

From the first 1-2 episodes, I (or you) can easily tell the show has quite amount of psychological aspect in it. So I recommend this anime to those who are into this genre. BUT do not expect an anime like those of Evangelion, Lain, Technolyze, or the other similar. The psychology theme here is rather simple, easy to swallow,(and perhaps shallow), but still quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has so many characters in it, some say 30, thirty? I don't know for sure, I didn't count. Why bother? Yes indeed it is indecisive to have too many, way too many characters and with only 12 eps available. But then again, why bother? The main idea here is, \"When you put a group of people in one place, put them all in one same situation, you will get various reactions from them, it shows differences in people personalities. This is basic knowledge in psychology study (I think :p).\"\\n\\n\r\nYes, I have read some people says the characters were not made well enough. Their actions/behavior were stupid, ridiculous, etc. Well, if you read the previous paragraph, this should have been answered already. Maybe some of the characters act really stupid, but I am not sure myself, if I were put in similar situation, will I have reacted any better?\\n\\n\r\nSome also say about half of the characters were useless, has no function at all whatsoever. I don't particularly give much care about that. Because what I really enjoy about here is seeing how the characters deal with their situations. And with so many characters in it you get to see so many different reactions. It is almost like sitting on Izaya's chair watching people dancing in the palm of his hand, if you know what I mean. (Maybe that's exaggerating)\\n\\n\r\nAnd I don't care about anything else. The drama was not there, (there was if you like cheap drama). Yes, it has some mystery atmosphere in it, but for me the main dish was the psychological aspect. And that's how I see it, why should I see it in any other ways? I look at what I like to see, and I overlook what I do not like to see. (Unwise, I know :p)\\n\\n\r\nThat's all then, I hope it provide enough justification for my score.\\n\\n\r\nI would've given it a 9 if not for that schizophrenia shit at the end of the show, really.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review were helpful.\\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n\r\nCheers.",

Mayoiga in all honesty wasn't a bad anime but I think people were disappointed because the tags are misleading and the ending was sort of anticlimactic.\r\nThis anime isn't really a \"horror\" anime like the tags say, but more along the lines of a supernatural mystery.\r\nThe story is about people who have experienced trouble in their past and banded together online to take a trip to a rumored hidden village where they can \"start over.\" This of course doesn't go as planned and they started seeing mysterious things. \r\ni can't really say muchor I'll be spoiling the whole thing, but basically the kids have to reopen old wounds and face their past.\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good and a certain grandma in the story was so well drawn it had me wondering how they could draw it so detailed.\\n\r\nSound wasn't that bad\\n\r\nCharacters development was okay. You don't really see much going on except with the protagonist Mitsumune and the characters he interacts with most like Masaki and Hayato.\\n\r\nI enjoyed Mayoiga even though I was originally looking for an actual horror anime (I've seen so many I just can't find any anymore).\\n\r\nIt's a good watch but it's not something that will have you hyped up and talking about it for weeks to come.",

I wait every season for brand new horror and with the same team that worked on Another working on Mayoiga I went into this with high expectations. Plot wise it sounded like something of a cross between Silent Hill and Higurashi. The large cast in addition to this leads you to believe that an impressive body count is inevitable.  Abandon any and all hope of this. Mayoiga is light fare.\r\n My experience with this show  was something like playing Apples to Apples junior after being used toCards Against Humanity. As horror it fails abysmally unless you happen to be frightened by the cute penguins from Mawaru Penguin Drum. At this point one might expect it to deliver as a suspense/mystery show. Mayoiga also fails to achieve this. The plot ends up feeling confused, meandering, and aimless; uncertain as to what plot point, themes, and characters to focus on. World building might have saved it but there wasn't any. Any explanations offered at the end of the show concerning any \"mysteries\" feel half assed and are unsatisfactory.\\n\r\nThe characters are all unoriginal and forgettable.Same goes for the setting of the show. I can't recall any part of the soundtrack either. The animation is average but any attempt at being new and unique it makes just ends up being laughable.\\n\r\nGive this show a pass. There are 0 redeemable qualities to it. I promise that you are not missing out on anything.",

            "content": "This actually looked really promising, at least when I read the description, but quickly after the first episode I become skeptical. It is an enormous task to make a well written original work anime with this many characters, and sadly the staff wasn\u2019t up to par, because they even failed when it comes to the few main characters. And the final product is one of biggest messes of this year, a total clusterfuck.\r\n- The main story isn\u2019t half bad, it at least got me interested in watching this, but with each passing episode, you see that the writers are making this stuff on the go,there is no way this was structured beforehand. There are also a few stupid plot twists thrown in, most of them with no actual weight behind them, there is a little to no explanation behind things going on, beyond a few lines of exposition. (2/10)\\n\\n\r\n- The animation is decent at best, with a lot of low points. Characters have mostly very bland facial expressions, a those who actually are expressing emotion(s) a lot, they still lack a lot of dynamics. There are also some bad uses of CGI used later in the series, painfully out of place looking, paired together with mostly bad design. But the biggest flaw is that the anime fails to build any kind of atmosphere with the visuals, it is completely incompetent to portray any kind of creepiness or mysteriousness and given that most of the anime should feel that way, I just cannot give it a pass. (3/10)\\n\\n\r\n- On the other hand, I actually liked both the opening and ending. Sadly everything in between sucked. The voice actors failed on most characters (however I would guess that bad script and poor story didn\u2019t really help them) and the voice of Mitsumune is a bit obnoxious. And just as animation, the sound design was so bad that it also failed to build any kind of atmosphere, and by this point I think that this anime was made by a bunch of amateurs for their first bigger project. (2/5)\\n\\n\r\n- Oh my god, where to begin. Bland characters with no development. Majority of them are one dimensional at best, some of them are even less than that, like they never change how they act or think, no matter the situation. A few of them get a short, sad backstory, but again, with no real weight behind it and it\u2019s just there to check off character development of the to do list. There is no, not even a little, chemistry between the characters, no feeling of love or friendship or even trust, absolutely nothing. For all I care, they could all die at any point in the anime and I would feel nothing for them. (1/10)\\n\\n\r\n- And despite all of the absolutely atrocious scores I just gave, I must admit, I actually enjoyed it a bit and I wanted to see more. Maybe not so because it was good, more because I wanted to see it they can make it even more stupid or if by a miracle, the show would actually get better. Spoiler alert, I guess, it didn\u2019t. However, that means it had enough entertainment value that it kept me going to the very end, a very low key end, but I do hope this is the end of this series as a whole. Edit: Apparently not, there is manga coming out right now and I actually hope it will be much better than the anime. (5/15)",

Had the producers and writers commited to an idea it may have turned into something a bit more special, but unfortunately it became a lethargic mess. \r\nMayoiga is about a group of 30 some odd people who want to escape their current lives by essentially running away to a hidden village and start life anew. With that in mind the show isn't about all 30 characters. The reality is that the core cast revolves around a group of around 5 or so. With the key characters being Mitsumune andMasaki. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is more or less stereotyped cardboard cut out character types. For the most part it isn't a bad thing here because there simply is no way they could've properly conveyed all the characters motives and backgrounds with out using such a method. \\n\\n\r\nThe real shame here is that that large casts potential is never used. \\n\\n\r\nThe show initially begins as a fairly dark, brooding, and moody fair. People are clearly putting on facades to their new co-habitors and there is something more sinister lying beneath the surface. It doesn't take long before characters are butting heads and they are already starting to distrust each other. A fact made worse once they find and enter the lost village. \\n\\n\r\nEverything until this point is fairly interesting and engaging, and this is what kept me watching all the way through. It was like watching an elaborate chess game where each type of piece interacted with other pieces on the board. The only problem is that were a chess game involves characters being taken out and removed (killed off) Mayoiga ends up being incredibly tame. \\n\\n\r\nWith it's mystery, drama, supernatural elements, and large cast you would've thought you have the perfect opportunity to push the show into a mystery genre who done it or even better all out survival horror show down with the characters slowly killing each other off, all while a monster is loose in the surrounding village. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately this is where the show absolutely falls apart. It simply isn't daring enough to do something exciting with these characters, and ultimately we get a very fluffy and tame resolution to all the issues the characters bring to the table, and half realized ideas. It doesn't commit to anything and the large casts potential is completely wasted. In the end there are some characters that felt like they were going to end up being important, but in the end never did (one such character is Lion, but oh well). \\n\\n\r\nAside from all of that it also looked like the animation dipped off half way through as well. Early episodes were visually more interesting and engaging, and later episodes also introduced some pretty poor CGI monster things. It just becomes a sloppy mess as it goes on. \\n\\n\r\nIt's certainly not the worst thing you can watch, I've watched a lot worse (Glasslip ... oh dear God, why were you so terrible). Still it's not a show I could ever properly recommend to any sort of genre fan.",

As someone who watched and loved Another, a brilliant horror anime directed by the same guy, the first few episodes of this show truly intrigued me.\r\nIntros are always cheesy, and almost all anime, especially those with large casts, present their characters as \"types\" in the beginning. This show is no different. I looked over this common convention and hoped that most of the characters would die off in a dead sprint of horribly awesome plot development and the others would be flushed out. This never happened. In fact, characters only seemed to be further pigeonholed into their respective stockinspirations as the show continued. After episode 4, each episode takes away from the show in a terrible way, leading to the lamest endings that ever lamed.\\n\\n\r\nSo the characters suck, but maybe there's a cool plot to this mystery here? Not really. All the intrigue is resolved pretty quickly and all the answers are given to you deadpan. Right when I was on the edge of my seat picking out details to figure out what was really going on, it was just explicitly told to me.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that it's just the methodical resolution of a whole bunch of crudely connected character arcs that you haven't been made to care too terribly about, as if the director started with a whole bunch of cool ideas and then had to figure out someway to tie them all together. That being said, there are some cool subplots ironically. Figuring out who the bad guy is for example.\\n\\n\r\nOk. So characters suck. Plot sucks. Mystery sucks. Was it at least scary? No. Never. Creepy at times, I guess, but Corpse Party makes this look like a little girls tea party. Pass the crumpets and pass on this show. Trust me, it's not worth it. Maybe watch Death Parade?

I read the plot of the anime and it's said there that there are 30 peoples who went to a village to escape from reality blah blah blah. I thought it would be a death game where only few people will be left at the end. But it was not.\r\nThe first episode was interesting because we can see the excitement among the people inside the bus and they all just know the mere fact that the village can beinhabited in order to run away from their miserable life, not knowing the consequences waiting for them when they arrived at the village. \\n\\n\r\nI was so eager and hyped to see what will happen on the next episode because the more that they kept the audience from waiting on what will happen to them inside the village, the more the excitement we can get. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\\n\r\nI was really disappointed when the anime revealed the mystery of its story to the viewers. It became a \"frustrated horror\" series wherein supernatural beings suddenly joined the plot of the story. Yes, I think they are not trying to impose a terrifying demeanor to the audience but they just want to show the tragic past of the characters using those supernatural creatures. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nThough the story was so dreadful, I can say that the art was good but not so amazing. There's a unique design for each character so you can easily distinguish a character from another one. The problem is, some of these designs were common and were somewhat similar from another anime series. The illustration of the setting was also fine and you can notice the mysterious ambiance exhibited by the village. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nI really like the soundtrack of this anime and each scene has a suitable background music. I also commend the opening song used in this anime (Gensou Drive) because I can sense the misery content of the song which perfectly suits the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\\n\r\nOnly a few characters were emphasized and the remaining people were just a mere background characters who did nothing to make the anime series electrifying. Although some characters has an interesting past and personal story, I guess it would be better if all the characters had given the same weight or the creator had decided to diminished their number before starting to air the anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the first part of the show because I was always looking forward to see the next episode until the main story of the anime happened. There are so many unessential chitchat between the characters so I got bored when I further watched this anime series. But I guess that the ending of this anime was fine but not that totally satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga is the same as other animes that was pretty good on the beginning but became stupid on the latter parts. My expectations on this anime flopped because I thought that it will have a very good story and it will be included on my favorite anime this season.",

It amazes with it's strangeness and the most interesting thing about it is the underlying idea about a place that manifests your trauma. \r\nWhen I started to watch the show, I felt compelled by the mystery. With every new episode I kept wondering what was going on. Why do those things happen? What does it all mean? \r\nYet, as many others already wrote, the rather interesting story was carried out in the most boring way possible. It could have been way more. \r\nWatching the one-dimensional characters act like total imbeciles really ruins any emotional attachment one might havehad. In my opinion, everything about this show kinda fits together and paints a really shallow picture.\\n\r\nThe characters would have been really bad in any other show, but they kind of fit here, as they each represent certain aspects. They are not so much meant to be human than ideas which could have turned out really well if only the show were to evoke some questions.\\n\r\nSome interesting main characters aren't discussed in the slightest (e.g. Nanka, the detective).\\n\r\nBut through all of it's weak ponts, it somehow fits. Mayoiga manages to form a Scenery out of it's music, characters and plot. It isn't a bad anime. It would have been rather good, if it just asked some questions instead of answering everything. Make the viewers think!\\n\\n\r\nI did not waste my time on this, but I probably wouldn't suggest it to anyone either.\\n\r\nBy the way: am I the only one who thinks of Mayoiga as some darker and stranger version of Angel Beats? :)",

The main reason it faltered was the characters and story while everything else namely the sound and art being pretty standard.\r\nStory was a killing point of this anime, which for the first few episodes felt completely different from the rest portraying itself in more of a mystery type genre which does not continue up to the point I have watched through. \r\nOtherwise the story feels well slow.\r\nThe art and story are what you would expect nothing to far out of the ordinary in either,besides some hiccups in the cg at points, most of which were likely played for uncanny and instead end up laughable. Music while actually quite well done was repetitive and had very few different leitmotifs and themes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are flat out abysmal. Mayoiga has many of the same troubles as many of other anime that have loads and loads of characters; being that they are all under-developed, relatively flat, go through minimal, if any, change in their character and some feel like decoration and inconsequential besides being named and given backstory. One pitfall unique to mayoiga is the fact that the main cast feel cardboard and cliched while some background characters are left in the dark besides feeling unique or interesting in comparison to the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nI had a very hard time enjoying this anime at all, the beginning was just interesting enough to keep me going, but for the reason above I had trouble and was fed up of watching characters I hated going through a boring world.\\n\\n\r\nIn eight deadly words: I don't care what happens to these people. 4/10",

            "content": "This is one of the anime which I had high hopes for after watching the trailer prior to the start of the season. The trailer portrayed the series as a realistic survival-mystery series (no super power or nothing supernatural) where a group of people strive to survive in an unfamiliar environment, which is something I greatly enjoy in a series. Spoiler alert, I am utterly disappointed with the series\r\nStory: 3/10 \u2013 clich\u00e9 and extremely disappointing\r\nBefore diving into the flaws, the premise of the story is actually pretty unique (as compared to the rest of the series for the past few seasons) and is seemingly promisingat first glance. This series could have done so much better in many ways given its premise.\\n\r\nThroughout the 12 episode run, it felt as though the series accomplished close to nothing. Clich\u00e9 characters coupled with overwhelmingly clich\u00e9 and unnecessary conversations and, superficial and cheesy \u201cproblems\u201d and \u201cresolutions\u201d. Many times, it felt as though the writers were mainly focusing on the characters and seriously neglected the progression and delivery of the story. Viewers were presented with too many underdeveloped backstories of the supporting characters, so much so that it failed to create any form of emotional connections with any of the characters, supporting or main alike. Additionally, too much time were spent on unnecessary conversations that accomplished nothing. At times, the overwhelming amount of conversation made it feel as though the story was going in circles. For example, whenever there is a group discussion, supporting characters tend to make small and forceful comments which feels as though the writers were trying their very best to falsely provide a unique identity via certain characteristics of their speech. All in all, the story development is poor and there is a poor flow of story progression.  \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 5/10 \u2013 average and nothing impressive\\n\r\nAnimation and sound effects wise, there is nothing to praise or complain about. Personally enjoyed the opening and ending track.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10 \u2013 generic anime tropes, poorly developed and too many\\n\r\nCharacters in the series feels blend and generic Many, if not all of the characters as though they were created by new writers who are constantly referring to their \u2018How to Create Anime Characters for Dummies\u2019 handbook. Of all the characters, the main character in particular annoyed me the most. So, let me start with the main character, Mitsumune.\\n\r\nPersonally, I am largely annoyed by the wimpy main character whom showers everyone with kindness and is pretty much oblivious to everything else. The character archetype was clear as day from the get-go. Still, I gave him another chance in hope of some character development which might potentially turn him into some badness (yes Kaneki, yes you). Unfortunately, nothing much happened. Yes, he might have sort of overcome his past which in the first place did not connect much with me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I AM capable of feeling empathy but just not with him. In retrospective, I do sympathise with Mitsumune and what he has to go through. However, the execution of his backstory was poorly done which resulted in the failure of any emotional connection between the viewer and the character himself. \\n\r\nAs for the supporting characters, 2 words to describe \u2013 too many. There were simply too many supporting characters for a 12-episode series. As a result, the writers probably struggled when they tried to give enough air time, focus and unique characteristics to distinguish every character. The final product of this futile struggle was multiple forceful and unnecessary comments throughout the series. As much as they could, the writers tried and failed to create distinctions between many of the supporting characters. Imagine this, the writers tried to create some sort of balance between the 20-odd supporting characters in a 12-episode anime while giving enough show time to 2 main characters and 2 other \u2018main\u2019 characters. Nope, I\u2019m sorry but this is quite an impossible feat. Due to the sheer numbers of characters and very limited air time, this then result in poorly developed characters where their backstories are touch-and-go and are forcefully showcased. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10 \u2013 (almost) every episode left me disappointed\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier in the article, I had high hopes for the series. The first 3 to 5 episodes managed to keep me interested as the characters journeyed and explored Nanaki Village despite some red flags such as the excessive conversations and blend characters. From there on, it became a nightmare for me as I came to realisation that this anime isn\u2019t what I had expected it to be. At times, I ended up alt tab-ing between the anime and other stuffs as I was honestly too uninterested with the story while still carrying some hope for the series. At some point of time, I see no glimpse of hope and prayed for the series to end so that I do not have to waste any more time. Ironically, I became interested for a whole other reason. I was curious to see how the series would end and how the writers would \u2018resolve\u2019 certain \u2018problems\u2019. If not for this and the first few episodes, I probably would have given \u20181/10\u2019 for \u2018Enjoyment\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10 \u2013 promising series and huge disappointment\\n\r\nBased on the initial trailer, the anime seems to tick all the right boxes for me. Survival? Check! Mystery? Check! Dark and realistic? Check to an extend! Survival as a group? Super check that! Sadly, the series differed greatly from what I have imagined, hoped and prayed for it to be. Survival? Check but the execution was so damn bad. Mystery? Check but mostly uninteresting once they reach Nanaki Village and it suffered a similar fate as the \u2018Survival\u2019 element. Dark and realistic? That\u2019s a big \u2018nope\u2019. Survival as a group? Super disappointed; poorly designed and developed supporting characters and it felt more like survival of the main character eventually as the supporting characters fades into darkness. \\n\r\nIn my opinion, I feel that the writers were trying to do too much in too little time span. The series could have delivered a lot better if they were to cut down the number of supporting characters and spend more time developing each character. Pay more attention to the main characters and pick better \u2018problems\u2019 or backstories for the characters. And please, the \u2018resolution\u2019 and ending was so clich\u00e9 and cheesy that I can\u2019t even anymore. In short, a great premise that got utterly destroyed by the writing.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation:\\n\r\nIf you have just gotten into anime, this series may still be passable for you as you might have not been exposed to too much of the generic anime trope characters. Even so, there are so much more quality animes available (with well-executed generic anime trope characters) that is much more deserving of your time and devotion. \\n\r\nFor veterans, this is not worth your time. Maybe if you have nothing left to watch. But still, no.\\n\\n\r\nTL; DR:\\n\r\n1.\tPromising premise but failed to live up to expectations\\n\r\n2.\tToo many characters which resulted in poor development\\n\r\n3.\tToo much talking as writers tried to give distinctive traits to each character\\n\r\n4.\tCheesy and clich\u00e9 plot and conversations\\n\r\n5.\tCompleting the series became a drag\\n\r\n6.\tDo not waste your time\\n",

            "content": "This review has no spoilers.\r\nIn reality, this is not really a review, but more my initial reflections about the show. You see, I tend use the Tag section as an outlet for thoughts about the anime I\u2019ve finished, but in the case of Mayoiga, that is not enough space. There is simply too much I want to say about it. So, let\u2019s begin.\r\nEssentially all of the characters adhere to a single trope of character type. In the beginning of the show, everyone introduced themselves to each other, every time a new character came on screen, I know who and what they would be. Now, I\u2019mnot one to hate tropes. There\u2019s a reason they exist, which is simply that they work. But when your entire cast can be neatly put into these boxes, you have an issue.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that really stood out to me in a positive way, however, was how the show built the trauma of many of the characters.  Many of the reasons the characters where trying to flee from the world seemed realistic, and to a point relatable.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is fairly straight forward, to be honest, and there\u2019s not much to say. This show attempts to be a character driven show, so I can pretty much forgive it for that. I do want to rant a bit about the ending, and how anticlimactic and horrible it was.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it well and truly was. The last few episodes had been pretty hectic, with big events and revelations happening all around. But then, instead of actually resolving the issues, it sticks in a romantic couple and calls it a day. It basically just forgives and forgets everyone, and acts like nothing happened throughout the span of the 12 episodes. It\u2019s like the author didn\u2019t know how to properly end it, and decided to just add a \u201cthey lived happily ever after\u201d ending.   \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I feel I must give this show a 4. Even though there were some positives, they were far outweighed by the negatives.\\n",

For a 12 episode to eventually familiarize everyone with all the characters, one-dimensional that some may be, is in itself a feat.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show, laughing with it, laughing at it, etc etc.  You won't have a masterpiece here.  Expect that going in, and it might be worth your while.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nMayoiga attempts a lot in its short time.  Don't watch this as your hype anime of the week.  Watch it between.  It may be a semi-amusing part of your day.  Don't go in expecting a horror. Instead join for the character and the light mystery if they amuse you.",

However, I must face some disappointments when progress with the story. The biggest one is due to my expectation to see complex mystery or intense thriller. And what I get is pretty lame supernatural phenomena. Well, the Psychological aspect is good though, I even learn something from this show. \r\nStory: pretty good, but slow paced with a lot of unnecessary events to slap your curiousness\r\nArt: The setting of village and surrounding are good, give you the right atmosphere, but I dislikethose things designs (what are the things? see it for yourself by watching)\\n\\n\r\nSound: no problem with VA, soundtracks are good, and the best thing is the music. I really love the OP and ED \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: a lot of annoying, weird, stupid or illogical characters, but those kind of people are whose supposed to join that shady trip, right?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Enjoyable with intriguing story and mystery, I recommend to watch it once you have full episode and enough time to watch it all at one go, to save you from cliff hanger and wild guessing",

            "content": "Mayoiga in one phrase: waste of time. I only got interested in this anime because it had the same art and feel as Another. It just goes to show that not all similar elements in 2 anime are the same.\r\nFirst, let me explain why the plot is a waste of time. At the beginning of the episode, we get an introduction of the characters. Typical, right? But After the conflict had been introduced, it turns out it wasn't the real conflict after all. They kept changing the story to the point that the sequence of events no longer made sense. It was full of plotholes and rushed events that it makes me wonder if the whole anime was just rushed or something.\\n\\n\r\nNext, let's look at the characters. Again, the introduction at the beginning was just for show. Heck, I don't even remember most of the cast. There were too many characters of no importance and those who do serve for the plot only do so for the sake of it. Yes, there were many memorable characters, but they'll only be mascots to this anime to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy myself? Absolutely not. Actually, I didn't even know why I bothered to watch it all the way to the end. Little to no character developments, duplication of personalities, use of tropes, and many more are the reasons why I don't recommend it to those looking for interesting anime. But if you wanna watch it, go ahead, I'm not stopping you. Just don't get lost in the plot of Mayoiga.\\n\\n\r\n(Still gave it a 5/10 because I looked at the anime as a whole, from beginning to end, episode to episode, etc.)",

            "content": "Oh what wasted potential on a show that seemed so promising. It had an interesting premise, it had the director, but this series just fell apart from the first episode. I thought it would be promising but oh how wrong could I be. This series just gives you many what the hell moments and stuff like why the heck would this happen and also jumps into the Anime Garden of Sinners. I feel like if this series was around 25 episodes, given a Fate/Zero type of character development, and had more time to develop the overall story, it would have been way more enjoyable. \r\nStory:1/10\\n\\n\r\n\tMayoiga\u2019s story is wasted potential everywhere. The basic plot is really a bunch of people on a bus go to a lost village since they want to escape their horrible reality. They go to a village that seems that it was abandoned not too long ago and try to live there. Little do they know that monsters are in the forest outside of the village. That\u2019s basically the plot of this series and boy does it really shit on the plot a lot. First of all, this anime literally explains next to nothing.  There are so many plot holes and wtf moments that leave so many questions unanswered that it\u2019s even worse than SAO in that respect and practically every single other anime out there. Hell, even Chaos Dragon has less plot holes than this. It really deteriorates the viewing experience and the overall feel and investment you have into the story. The ending of this story is also very abrupt and not an ending that I would like. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n\tOkay so Mayoiga\u2019s art isn\u2019t that bad except for the CGI monsters at some points. There really isn\u2019t too much to talk about the art other than it looks decent and looks like something from 2015 and 2016. The CG looks like absolute shit sometimes, and is so ugly. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThe sound is okay. It heightens the tone sometimes but also just feels out of place in others.  The Op is a good op for once but the Ed is something that I don\u2019t really like too much. Overall, the sound is okay, it\u2019s at least better than some anime in this season. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThe characters are the worst part of this series. I immediately realized that the series\u2019 cast was doomed to fail since there are so many characters. There must have been at least 20 or something on the bus and it would have been impossible to develop all the characters thoroughly. I don\u2019t even remember half the characters names. The show literally just forgets about pretty much all the characters halfway through and most of them don\u2019t get any development at all. Only a select few get some development and they are the characters you hate. This series doesn\u2019t know how to develop characters properly and has such a large cast of characters that even if it tried, it couldn\u2019t develop them in the time frame given. All the characters are easily forgettable and development would have been better if the story had a sort of Fate/Zero type of development where every character at least gets some development. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\\n\r\n\tI really hated watching this series. It was the story and poor characters that really dragged my enjoyment. The sound and animation sort of brought up my enjoyment but it was not enough to bring my enjoyment of this show from a 1 to a 2. It\u2019s bad, cringe-worthy, and not worth watching at all. The fact that this show could have just been so much better really brought down my enjoyment too. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThis show is bad. It\u2019s has bad story, characters, and is un-enjoyable overall. It also has decent animation and sound but that can\u2019t save this show. It had so much potential, all wasted in my opinion. You should never watch this show at all. It\u2019s one of the worst shows of this season and should not be watched at all. The only reason you would watch this is because you want to watch something made by the director of Another and that\u2019s about it. \\n",

            "content": "This will be my first review for a series on this site. Despite having seen a fair share of anime, and in many different styles; I've been very hesitant to write a review because I've been afraid of being biased and simply giving out a score because I enjoyed something. Enjoyment is a very subjective term, as I may have personally found something interesting, while others may have loathed it. But today, I set that all aside: and announce that I will attempt to approach all reviews from an objective standpoint. Noting on a few things a title did well, as well as areas whereit is lacking. \\n\\n\r\n(I.E. I want to review things critically, instead of whining about something I disliked, or mindlessly praising things that happen to catch my fancy)\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to note, I feel every category, or rating for a particular show: starts out at a 5/10. This is NOT a bad thing: for reviews 5/10 = MEDIOCRE and for a series as a whole 5/10  = AVERAGE from then on they gain and lose points from there. This keeps one from being too biased, and giving high scores based on one's enjoyment, which is flawed reasoning in my mind. You can enjoy a terrible show or movie, while still recognizing it was a failure on a critical level.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: (3/10 = Poor)\\n\\n\r\nThe concept seemed interesting at first. A bunch of characters with pasts they would like to forget, as they start over in a new place. Key phrase here: AT FIRST. For a twelve episode title, juggling the development of so many characters (there are at least 6) leads to rushed pacing, nonsensical reasoning, unanswered questions, and not surprisingly: info dump sessions where exposition is told to the viewer as opposed to being shown. And for a mystery series, this makes one's overall enjoyment take a dive towards the middle of the series. \\n\\n\r\nPositive: Some of the past \"traumas\" of characters are sympathetic, and the initial discovery of The Village and its state, sets itself up for at least a somewhat interesting take on the horror and mystery genre within anime.\\n\\n\r\nNegative: The writing is a complete mess. The script for characters is filled with plenty of vague comments, ambiguous questions, and sometimes characters will outright dodge a question with a meek and timid response. It also goes nowhere, as there too many characters to develop. The pacing is very slow, despite its few episodes, nothing of note related to the central premise is explored or mentioned in any meaningful way. The ending of the series is also very cliche to say the least. Everyone's problems are solved, Hooray! And felt more like an info-dump and plot convenience hack than anything meaningful. It's very forgetful because they do not try to innovate on the genre, but merely seem to go for a \"safe\" ending. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: (1/10 = Pathetic)\\n\\n\r\nI don't feel the animation is of any note quality for this series. The art style is very mediocre for a title in 2016, and I feel as time goes on: this will age terribly. The character designs were quite bland, and for there to be a plethora of characters, this is bad thing. The only unique design worth noting is Lion-san. The males that serve as background characters, all look somewhat alike, and the same goes for the females. The \"monster\" if you would call it, is also comprised of CG animation: which wasn't a bad thing at first, as CG animation in anime is often off-putting and jarring to the eyes, so it fits the genre in an ironic sense. However, I don't feel there was any real effort going into the design of the \"monster\" after seeing it in its full state, (which is dependent on the character) it's a bland sight to see. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: (1/10 = Pathetic)\\n\\n\r\nI will mention the opening in ending theme here after briefly discussing the OST. Regarding that last topic, there is nothing of note here. They use about three generic sounding songs with bland instruments for the soundtrack, and always at the same places. Mystery intensifies: Insert mysterious song. Horror begins: insert this scary song. Conflict arises: insert this conflict song. Not to mention none of these are very good. They don't serve to pull the viewer into the scene, they feel more like a distraction, as they do not know when to exactly input the song. Sometimes, an OST track will begin while characters are saying something meaningful to the plot, which is distracting and annoying. Or other times, no sound can add a \"creepy\" effect, and they ruin it by inputting a generic sounding song to add to the affect, which ironically takes away from it.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is nothing special. Generic faces of the characters, with a very uninspired credits sequence beside their faces. Watching it makes me feel it was rushed, as the particular song they chose has nothing to do with the anime in my opinion. It should be an off-putting song to get us into the feel for this anime, not a pretty melody. The ending was also lacking for the same reason. I did like the instrument they used for it, but again: the ending sequence is the same lazy material as the opening.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: (2/10 = Dreadful)\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, there are quite a few characters (introduced via the first episode on the bus) and we get an introduction to all of them, including a glimpse at their personality through the name they have chosen to go by. As the series goes on: a majority of them become background characters, or simply serve the purpose of creating cheap conflict through misunderstandings. If you are new to the mystery genre, you will find the main character quite frustrating. AS they are usually the most idiotic in the series, to give the mystery and drama an added affect. With that being said, the main character is a simple and weak character. Just as the rest of the cast that are relevant. The thing I found odd about these characters is that they say that they want to start life over, but come packaged with the same attitudes and terrible personalities that made them leave reality in the first place. None of them display any actual growth by the end of the series, it's really just more of the same. And as the series goes on: the plot and run-time sadly focuses on the main character, and a female he's latched onto for no reason whatsoever other than a vague impression he had on her. Hardly any of the other characters are explored, aside from a brief flashback of a few individual traumatic pasts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: (2/10 = Dreadful)\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy this anime. I felt the obligation to finish it purely because I started it. I also felt the need to write this review because I care enough to do so. I did not go into this series hating it, I felt it was average (5/10) after the first three episodes. But the consistent issues involving plot, characters, sound, and overall feel drove my anticipation for this anime to drop week by week, episode by episode. I dislike when there is hardly anything happening. And for a mystery and horror themed anime: this dislike is magnified as the story is the most important aspect in such a series.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: (1/10 = Pathetic or Appalling)\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a mystery series to pass the time, look elsewhere. You will find nothing but frustration and info dumps in this title. Aside from that, I would like to restate the above: this series started out as a 5/10 = AVERAGE and from then on as the episodes continued, it lost points from me on a critical level. This show also failed to entertain me. I've been reading reviews on this site for awhile now before viewing a show, and I find myself never ACTUALLY getting an answer as to whether or not I should watch something. I am telling you now, this is a terrible anime. It does nothing to innovate on the genre it is in, and avoids exploring its mystery through compelling dialogue and scenes, and instead relies on simply telling the viewer how things are, with a \"Because I said so\" attitude. That with poor artwork, characters, and sound, makes this title very unworthy of a re-watch in my case, or your time, my dear reader. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this, if you found it helpful and didn't do a TL;DR\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mayoiga is one of the most indecisive anime for Spring of 2016 for LA and with good reason.\r\nSo with the first thing LA would say is that Mayoiga has tons of characters 31 to be exact and the majority of the cast hardly get any development and are more satellite characters to the characters who DO get the focus. For the characters who do get the focus, like Masaki, Mitsumune, Hayato, the bus driver, Love-pon, Valkana, Yura Mikage and Koharun at best gets \"character backstory\" and some intention of focus. Oddly enough most of the character backstories is almost meaningless to the overall narrative, thenarrative being the Lost Village's mystery of the anime's title namesake.\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga definitely has that B-movie grade levels of horror and it's even composited like one too and because of it's B grade horror, it gives vibes of beings an unintentional comedy and mindfuck. However once the \"mystery\" is told about this anime, almost all the amount of tension and \"horror\" gets thrown out the window to the point of just being too convenient or just really stupid on the characters part, the only times the tensions work is during the annoyingly cut cliffhangers of many of the episodes. The huge cast of characters is really hard to bring depth to the cast and it shows when we get sloppy character backstory just for the \"gimmick\" to \"make sense\" and really on speaking of the gimmick it becomes extremely apparent what the gimmick/mystery is, anyways because of it, lots of the characters become mean spirited or just an asshole or stupid or both. The only character LA liked were Lion voiced by ''Hiromi Igarashi'' as she was the only character to both have a backstory and not be an asshole.\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga's animation done by Diomedea is actually pretty good as from the character designs being crisp and well animated, background work was decent and made the paranoia let alone the paranoia of the main cast even better. However there is some eerie animation used for the *ahem* mystery of Mayoiga using something like CGI but crudely animated, it's unique but weird at best and really LA can give grace to the CGi as on context it works in both animation and plot-wise. Mayoiga's animation if the plot or characters to the people who watched this \"sucked\" then the animation is at least a bright spark to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, well LA won't say much due to the large cast of members, the ONLY voice actor LA liked was the psychotic \"execution execution\" ranting Love-pon voiced by Ai Kakuma, her lunacy vocals helped this anime's unintentional hilarity even better. Even then it felt like Ai Kakuma's psychotic ranting rubbed off on the other characters later on, HAMMINESS ABOUND IN MAYOIGA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. On the other hand the voice acting is as contrasting to Ai Kakuma's, it's dull and lifeless to most of the satellite characters. Voice acting in Mayoiga is either \"blithering batshit crazy\" or \"the voice actor is self-aware of the script and not taking it seriously\" and there is no inbetween. \\n\\n\r\nMayoiga's ending culminates in...a huge anti-climax, something like a shady therapist session (which is also said word by word by one of the character by the way, self-awareness?...or they just did \"just because?\") using supernatural means, it's just like they rushed it to no end to the satellite characters but especially the \"main cast members\" of Mitsumune, Masaki and Hayato and really although the ending \"wrapped up\" the character plotlines and the \"mystery\" of the anime, but really LA just couldn't take this ending seriously to the point of making the central focus of this anime into a pitiful joke. WOW.\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga is a curious case where this anime tries to disguise itself like a B-grade horror but really it's a weird character analysis piece anime really it it it just gets worse from there. Mayoiga isn't meant to be taken seriously and it really does show it pretty quickly. LA said that Mayoiga was an indecisive anime but when Mayoiga really \"shows\" itself, LA would say two things about it. Mayoiga is a crazy horror parody with Tsutomu Mizushima's directing and is utterly hilariously serious about it. YET, LA will say this is one of the weirdest, horribly tacky anime LA saw in Spring of 2016. Take it if you will if LA is saying this sarcastically or honestly or not.",

The basic problem I had with the story is that it never really leaved up to the hype of the first few episodes, some episodes who although were kind of vague they also were the ideal prologue to the series. A prologue who made youwatch the series until the final episode due to the fact that it made you believe that something great would follow something worth your time and exactly that mysterious aura is the one thing that made the story good although as time went by it became clear that this wasn't the case. \\n\\n\r\nArt7/10\\n\r\nThe art is good nothing more nothing less, just plain good.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack is in the same level as the art nothing special but alright,\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nThe characterization is the thing that made the show really anooying at some moment.\\n\r\nFirst of all by the time that Mayoiga ended i caught my self knowing just 6 out of nearly 20 characters names, that mainly happened because in just 12 episodes there were presented so many people who in fact  were not that different to each other to begin with.\\n\r\nSecondly all the characters seem to be completely dumb to an extent in which most of the time you want to punch them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nThe Enjoiment overall was good although for an anime pf the mystery genre it turned out being more of a slice of life thing.And mainly the enjoyment came from some great and special backstories that were presented, we should give them at least some credit. \\n\\n\r\nOveral 6/10\\n\r\nPromising anime that did not leave up to its expectations.\\n\r\nNothing more nothing less...",

            "content": "A bunch of people are fed up with the latest elections... er... state of things and decide to just leave it all behind. This group of odd misfits is destined for Nanaki Village, a place that supposedly is sort of an urban legend like the Bermuda Triangle. Is it really the utopia that everyone thinks? Or is something more sinister lurking in the shadows.\r\nWell if you're looking for something out of the ordinary, then perhaps Mayoiga might be an option. The show probably best falls under the category of a mystery, though a rather slow one. It's full of rather unusual characters and a settingthat really doesn't make sense until the very end, and even then, things don't always add up. Overall, Mayoiga is a bumpy and meandering bus ride that doesn't end up where you'd think it would.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty solid in Mayoiga. The show is drawn in a relatively strong color palette with saturated colors and pretty detailed backgrounds. A lot of scenes are appropriately dark with eerie shadows and shading. There is a fair amount of ugly 3D CGI, most notably towards the end of the show. There are many characters, like way more than I can remember the names of. Luckily, it isn't terribly important as only half of the characters really play any significant role in the story. Character expressions are average overall, definitely not as convincing as those in Another.\\n\\n\r\nThere is occasional action in the show, though honestly as a mystery the main action is purposely hidden from the viewer. There is a bit of suggestive language but this is not really an ecchi show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe unlucky hippopotamus song. I know I usually ramble about the OP/ED, but it's all about the hippo song here- it plays near the very beginning of the show and at the very end of the show. It's an unfortunately catchy tune that serves as a metaphor for the show as a whole, as well as cementing the fact that the characters are all a tad weird to be singing along to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is a rather fast-paced piece, considering the pacing of the show, though it has a pretty decent main melody. The ED is a more fitting cool down piece that probably will be skipped due to the endless cliffhangers in the show. The BGM is fittingly tense with lots of ambient noises that make you feel like something bad will happen at any moment. Unlike most shows these days, a central melody will continue to \"haunt\" you throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA cast consists primarily of relatively junior members. The more senior VAs have fairly minor roles; Ak Kakuma is relegated to voicing a crazed sadist who yells \"execute\" all the time. Ayaka Shimizu probably lucked out with one of the more normal roles, thus earning her my top performance vote. There is a ton of conversation in this show, expect to have to deal with very fast lines and a lot of background commotion.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nGiven that this is a mystery, I can't really go into detail with plot specifics. The atmosphere is less bloody though somewhat similar to that in Another. It is also similar to Another in the sense that Masaki always seems to know more than she lets on about, a strikingly similar parallel to Misaki. Given the sheer number of characters, I was honestly expecting this to be something along the lines of Mirai Nikki or Danganronpa- believe me it's quite different.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of story composition, there is one central plot that drives the entire show. Despite the rather slow pacing within each episode, a lot takes place and thus skimming/skipping is strongly discouraged. The show does feature a lot of chaos; there's a lot of fake foreshadowing, making you think things are going to happen a certain way before surprising you and going a completely different direction. Nonetheless, there is a solid, continual build up to a final climax in the last episode. Yes, the mystery is explained and there is a semblance of a resolution, but it does feel rather rushed and leaves many questions/plot holes. I can't really go into the plot holes without spoiling too much, but let's just say that the show leaves a lot to the viewer's imagination.\\n\\n\r\nThe execution is fair overall, but the story progression is rather bumpy; they purposely engineered for all the major events to be at the beginning and end of episodes. This means that practically every single episode ends on a wild cliff hanger, yet one may doze off in the middle of the episode where everyone spends minutes talking and scratching their heads.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is a seriously messed up group of characters, in both a good and bad way. These are people who would rather die than continue to live in society, and yet they are forced to band together to create their own community with their own rules. This is rather challenging as they all escaped reality for very different reasons; the only thing holding them together is their disgust with the world outside the village.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, that's about all the good words I can spare for this section. This show has excessively many characters for its own good. Because of this, there isn't any focus as over half a dozen of the characters get the full exposition treatment. I get that this group isn't normal, but the decision and rationale (or lack thereof) shown throughout the show is appalling. Our main protagonist Mitsumune is supposedly sixteen, yet behaves with the mental age of a preteen. I guess I should be happy that the story even bothered to explain why some of the characters are here, but really some of their reasons are just so stupid that perhaps it really is better that they aren't part of the greater society.\\n\\n\r\nPitiful character interactions aside, the character development as a whole is rough. I guess the entire premise revolves around the characters being dynamic, but it feels very artificial, especially when things are rushed near the end of the show. Don't expect much in the form of romance in the show as well.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis is a difficult show to review. There are definitely some good elements in the show, and if you're anything like me, you'll finish the show in a jiffy due to the cliffhangers. However, despite the entertainment value, the story lacks serious polish and there is just too much to hate with the cast of characters. Those looking for a serious mystery or horror will probably find this show unfulfilling. Those looking for strong characters or relationships likewise won't find much here. Ultimately, it seems what's really lost in this show is the target audience.",

            "content": "I've never written a review before, but I felt like I needed to say some words about Mayoiga, or in English \"The Lost Village.\" I suppose I'll get right into it then.\r\nI initially decided to watch Mayoiga because it was advertised on the site as a horror anime, and after watching the first episode I was curious if it might be similar to Another, one of my favorite horror animes because of the large cast of characters and the strange mystery of Nanaki Village that reminded me of Yomiyama North. I was sorely mistaken, but I stayed nonetheless, with hopes that the story might redeemitself. I suppose it could be considered family-friendly horror, if there is such a thing. The story had a lot of potential, and some would say if the anime had been longer the writers would have had more room to expand on that potential. I both agree and disagree for the fact that, much of what happened story-wise was unnecessary in my opinion. If the writers dropped out the unnecessary bits and instead expanded on the points that people actually cared about, you could still have a satisfying anime in only 12 episodes. From the beginning there's a mystery to the story, which is what is part of the charm at first. However, as developments are made, some new out of place mystery pops up. This happens over and over again to the point the mystery is just exhausting. As someone who writes and enjoys mystery, there are better ways to keep the audience hooked. The sense of urgency and panic seemed to escalate far too quickly, showing just how poorly written the story was. The writers almost make it obvious they were grasping at straws by making the characters do exactly the same.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't anything I would write home to my parents about, in fact certain scenes the animation was downright cringe worthy. For the most part though it was just average. It didn't really look much different from the average modern animation style. I wasn't really expecting much from it as far as art and animation goes, although it's always disappointing in a way when things don't exceed expectations. One scene in particular toward the end of the anime really makes it look cheap, because of the obvious use of poorly done CG. It's possible the CG had been used prior to that point, but I don't recall noticing it. The points where the art really could have been made much more eye-catching, well \\n\\n\r\nAlmost none of the soundtrack left enough of an impression on me to really even remember what it sounded like. In my opinion music is a major part of setting the mood, and I while I feel the music did follow the mood, it didn't set it if you get what I'm saying. In anything horror-esque the background music or lack thereof is what really turns my blood cold, sends chills down my spine, and gets me jumpy, any good soundtrack horror or not should invoke some kind of emotion. The soundtrack for Mayoiga didn't really do that for me. As far as the OP and ED go, well I suppose the OP should have been my first hint this wasn't really going to be a horror anime. Now, I'm writing this having never seen the English translations or listened to the full tracks for both songs. I'm not entirely sure I can express what my impression was from the OP without actually spoiling the true premise of the anime that you don't learn until later in the story, so I'll say is it just sounded out of place from the start. The ED is not really any different from a lot of other EDs from various genres of anime, slow paced and melancholy, nothing to brag about. Really the OP is the only thing that stands out as far as the soundtrack of this anime, only because it sets a different mood from the majority of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga sets up a vary large cast in the first few minutes of the first episode, introducing us to everyone and making them all seem at least a little important because of the seemingly diverse archetypes, and well they all have names so that makes them important too right? Ah, yet again hopeful me was wrong. Without giving spoilers I will say over half of the cast doesn't even matter, they are a bucket of poorly written fillers so that it's not just a story about a handful of equally as mediocre characters. The main character is barely tolerable in most moments, but then again I can say the same for most of the characters. A good deal of the characters are written to be so outrageous and extreme it makes me want to claw out my own eyes. We're led to believe everyone has a heart wrenching backstory that led them to leave their pasts behind, yet we don't even get to find out what half of those pasts are. I wish I could say that only occurred for the part of the cast that was basically irrelevant, but a few of the characters that had quite a bit of screen time or seemed the most developed that I was wondering about the entire series never got a backstory. I feel though, had the characters that actually mattered to the story been written better, I wouldn't have felt the need to bore you with talk about fillers.\\n\\n\r\nI had high hopes for Mayoiga right up until the very end, but each episode left me either feeling disappointed or unsatisfied right up to the very end. From trying to come off as a horror when it's not really a horror, to the mediocre at best characters, I'm amazed to say I still enjoyed it to some extent. And, I believe the reason for that is Mayoiga had so much potential, that had it been met it would have been an excellent story. It took me several months for finally finish the anime because of the poor writing, but I still found myself wanting to finish just to find out what would happen in the end. I also can't say I wasn't happy with the ending, just not satisfied with the amount of information I was left with. I won't try to sway you from watching Mayoiga, because it's not the worst of animes, and if you're like me the potential alone makes it worth the shot.",

If you asked me, i'd say its pretty difficult, but I'd like to explain why Mayoiga was so unsatisfying.\r\nFor this review Ill disregard what its about as MAL provides a description, but express the issue with it. The story line establishes itself as a \"death flag\" style show. The scenes are set up to be eerie and uncomfortable, but ironically, they fail to do so. The show builds itself to be scary and uncomfortable, but instead became laughably bad. Each character felt stale, irrational overdone, the way the behave is oddif not hard to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot line starts ok, but spirals out of control till its basically doesn't follow any progression or story line. It jumps and skips around to eventually explain its goal, which doesn't fit the show well to begin with. Music and artwork is fine, but not memorable, and with the characters distasteful feels flat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show just was poorly executed. Characters were mehh, many scenes felt wildly inconsistent and out of place,  and the ending was stale due to  no connectivity with the cast or setting. In short, if your looking for a dark show, this is not the place to start. Shows like Another, or shiki do a far better job.",

            "content": "Mayoiga wasn't that bad. Hear me out.\r\nWhen I read the synopsis EVERYTHING appealed to me. \r\nPeople like me going somewhere to start a new life? yes.\r\nSetting is in an abandoned rural village? yes!\r\nHorror to ensue?? YES!\r\nSOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT THIS WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE?! YE- wait, what?\r\nOh boy, was it a ride. Not a good one, but a ride indeed.\r\nI gave this anime a 5 out of 10. The plot, on paper/in theory, is one of the most refreshing I've seen in a while. It's different and it tackles something people in real life deal with on a near daily basis- their inner turmoiland the fact that they want to escape it.\\n\r\nNow, I'm not sure why they did this, but execution (lol) was subpar at best. If I leave out their flawed attempt at giving their million characters depth, this could have been something worth more than 5/10. But their feeble attempt at doing so made this into an at most times almost unbearable watch.\\n\r\nWe're then left with characters you can't help but hate because all we know about them is  a 2 minute-3 frame backstory that makes you think its alright to pick on them because they're being whiny imps. I'm left with no sympathy, nothing to help me grasp on to when there was suspense building during the show and between the characters. Basically I'm just left confused and wondering why they even bothered doing it.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the plot a fair amount, though. Like I said, the idea behind it was pretty good. Especially when things started to shape up to what it was supposed to be. The beginning of the series was just sloppy and a slight annoyance, however, and had it not been for the fact that I started this show when it was complete I probably would have dropped it by episode 2 or 3.\\n\\n\r\nIn hindsight, if I'm honest I couldn't see this series get any better if there were more episodes- rather I think most people, myself included, would enjoy it more had it had less characters to focus on, perhaps 7 tops. This would give writers more than enough time to flesh out their main characters while sticking to their main objective- supposedly scaring the hell out of us while teaching us a valuable lesson (don't run away from your past blaah...).\\n\\n\r\nwhich leads me to genre. If you think you're getting into something akin to \"Another\" or \"Higurashi\" you've got another thing coming to you. While I silently applaud their attempt at trying to scare us, it's not really horror. Mystery, definitely. Comedy? Perhaps under the \"it's so bad it's good\" genre.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in short, good plot ideas, horribad execution. Overall not the worst I've seen. Definitely not something I want to see again, either.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThe needle struck me once. Twice. Thrice.\r\nBy the fourth time, I was ready to scream, to run out of the room because I couldn\u2019t endure the pain any longer.\r\nIt was my first time being administered anesthesia, but the nurse had continually missed my vein. Now, to this day, whenever I go into the doctor\u2019s office for a shot, I tend to close my eyes and look away because of the mini ordeal I went through.\r\nI wouldn\u2019t call it a phobia, but this experience from my past certainly affected me. Mayoiga scares me slightly, too, butfor unintended reasons.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga starts off with a bus, a rainy night, and a crew bent on ditching their old lives. The goal? Make it to the fabled Nanaki Village, a place known for its mystery and seclusion. However, when the group gets there, not all is as it seems\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nIn the same way that Mayoiga goes the metaphorical route, the best way to understand the anime is through an extended metaphor.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a puzzle-piece set put together by a toddler: Everything is there but not in the right places, so the bigger picture is lost.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the bigger picture since it can be seen in full on the front of the box this puzzle comes in. The anime is about facing one\u2019s past. More specifically, it is about facing the past and embracing it.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s a nice theme. Mostly because it\u2019s one that the audience can relate to. Arguably everybody has gone through a tough time at one point or another. Yes, such events may not be as vile as bee torture or as cruel as an abusive debtor, but nearly everyone has a demon, a part of their past that they would rather just forget.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the box is unwrapped and the cover lifted, what pieces lie inside? In other words, what elements go towards creating this bigger picture?\\n\\n\r\nThe most obvious (arguably the most important) are the Nanaki. According to Mayoiga, the Nanaki are the demons of Mitsumine\u2019s, Hayato\u2019s, and everyone else\u2019s pasts. But it\u2019s more than that. These Nanaki are physical manifestations of the psychological turmoil the cast have experienced before.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of power exists in simply making them actual entities. For instance, \u201crunning away from one\u2019s fears\u201d is no longer a figurative phrase but a literal action the characters take. There\u2019s also the personalized nature of the Nanaki. I.e., rather than having it be one, evil monster the group must defeat, they each have an individualized issue that must be confronted.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on but still related, the effects of foregoing one\u2019s Nanaki are another puzzle piece. The show first alludes to the notion with sleepy characters, later confirmed by the researcher, and finally witnessed as the cast find themselves severely fatigued. It stems from those that don\u2019t face their Nanaki \u2013 they slowly vanish away into nothingness. Meaning, like life, one must conquer those demons lest he or she find himself or herself ruled by them.\\n\\n\r\nThe village itself is also a puzzle piece. Those who stayed behind hold the implication that this same set of events has happened before. That\u2019s why it appeared that the village was used until just recently; the people back then vanished from not accepting their Nanaki. That is, this theme has repeated itself with multiple groups, across multiple generations.\\n\\n\r\nMore puzzle pieces: foreshadowing of death, a ringleader among them causing havoc, the misinformation surrounding the village, the pitch-black tunnel, and the hive-mind mentality leading to atypical violence.\\n\\n\r\nThe pieces are all there, out on the table, ready to form that bigger picture.\\n\\n\r\nThen the toddler arrives.\\n\\n\r\nThe first misplaced piece is confronting the Nanaki. Yes, some of the characters, like Hayato and Masaki, do face their fears. But, as the ending depicts, the large majority of the characters simply leave the village without any trouble whatsoever. Despite how perilous their situation was throughout the entire season, despite how much importance the Nanaki gain, the anime throws this puzzle piece away.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, that majority magically appear on the bus alongside the main cast with everyone singing the song they sung at the beginning \u2013 an off-putting tonal shift considering they just left many potential friends behind.\\n\\n\r\nThe fatigue puzzle piece also gets misplaced. The characters were already pretty useless, so this direction made them even more so. Furthermore, it was not a plot point until much later in the anime. While the explanation makes sense, it comes off as convenient rather than established.\\n\\n\r\nNanaki Village\u2019s puzzle piece is mishandled, too. Despite all of the warnings about staying behind and ignoring one\u2019s Nanaki, it doesn\u2019t seem to matter. Those who choose to stay say they will figure out more about the Nanaki, but all evidence points to that just not being possible. Again, the idea was not to live alongside or battle with one\u2019s Nanaki. The idea was to embrace them.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, the anime chooses to ignore its death foreshadowing \u2013 Lion\u2019s ability to predict the fate of others and literally bringing back a character presumed perished being chief examples.\\n\\n\r\nEverybody just forgives Koharun for not only manipulating them but also nearly getting many of them killed. The same can be said of Jack and Hyouketsu no Judgness but to a lesser extent.\\n\\n\r\nNobody apparently checked books, newspaper articles, or even just the Internet that would contain the research conducted by the researcher. Plus, he is a living testament of what happens in that village. DNA records, a social security number, or any other piece of identification make it hard to believe that absolutely nobody would listen to what he had to say.\\n\\n\r\nThe emphasis placed on the tunnel and what lies beyond does not matter since very many of the crew never actually go through it, and one\u2019s Nanaki can seemingly be confronted anywhere. Worse still, going through the tunnel doesn\u2019t immediately help, and the ominous feelings surrounding the tunnel are moot when the other side is simply more village.\\n\\n\r\nStone-tipped arrows, getting slammed into a wall, and outrunning behemoths matter not to these people who seem to have skeletons made of steel.\\n\\n\r\nThe toddler plays with all of these puzzles pieces. And when he is done playing, the pieces are strewn about every which way. Some are mashed into spots they don\u2019t belong. Some are connected to the wrong connectors. Some even fell off the table in the process.\\n\\n\r\nSo when the audience comes in, they do not see a bigger picture about embracing one\u2019s past.\\n\\n\r\nWhat they do see is one giant mess.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nMost of Mayoiga\u2019s art is not too impressive. The village itself lacks detail, the cast find themselves in a dense forest half the time, and the visuals rarely take advantage of nuance or cinematography.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the CG work is no better. Namely, the silicone-implant hermit crab and the giant, fused-fish grandma were more silly looking than scary looking, defeating the purpose of those Nanaki.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the anime did well in creating a horror-esque atmosphere. For example, the constant nighttime setting, the moonlit sky, and the blanketing fog turn Nanaki Village into an unsettling domain. Furthermore, some of the Nanaki can be pretty scary. The massive, malformed bee and the undead grandmother (before becoming a fish monster) receive threatening or spooky designs that let the audience feel the fear that the characters do.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of designs, those of the characters are at least passable. They are different from one another without treading into overly eccentric territory. Nettaiya\u2019s sexy dress fits her promiscuous personality, Dozaemon is pudgier due to his eating habits, Yura\u2019s thin glasses give him a sense of intelligence, Narna\u2019s beanie makes her out to be more of a tomboy, and Lion\u2019s yellow hoodie fits both her name and her relative estrangement.\\n\\n\r\nNothing outstanding, but they are at least realistic and varied.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Mayoiga\u2019s actual animation, it can go either way. The characters run around a lot, and they have various reactions of shock, terror, happiness, and sadness that shake up the festivities. But they also sit around a lot, too, merely talking to one another without moving or doing too much.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga is an anime with an absurdly large cast. Enough people to fill a big bus. Thus, the anime encounters an inherent dilemma: not enough time to properly flesh them all out.\\n\\n\r\nIgnoring the main cast for now, and to the anime\u2019s credit, it does investigate some of its characters. Most notably, Love-pon, Nyanta, Jigoku no Gouka, and Yura each receive backstories that help to center where their central fears originate.\\n\\n\r\nFor Love-pon, it was an abusive \u201cmonk\u201d who took advantage of her mother. For Nyanta, it was bullying at the hands of both girls and bees. For Jigoku, it was trying his hardest, taking a risk, and still coming up short. For Yura, it was extreme humiliation after a failed promise.\\n\\n\r\nOther side characters also get backstory. Not as much as these four, but it\u2019s still important to point out. Lion\u2019s prediction powers used by her mother for scamming, Yottsun\u2019s classical-instrument-playing parents, Valkana\u2019s workplace problems, and Untensha\u2019s deceased daughter give them, however slightly, more to their respective characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to be as absolutely fair as possible, some side characters have their pasts alluded to without outright delving into them. Nettaiya\u2019s stalker, Pii-tan and Manbe\u2019s disallowed relationship, and Maimai\u2019s boyfriend issue and loss of friends are minimal in detail but details all the same.\\n\\n\r\nTaken together, one big question needs answering: Did Mayoiga do \u201cenough\u201d with its supporting cast?\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s difficult to say.\\n\\n\r\nOn the one hand, the show makes the right call in expounding only on a handful of its side characters and their Nanaki because, realistically, it should be obvious what is going on after witnessing it four or so different times.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Nanaki are the entire point of the show, so not providing their backstory and not revealing their Nanaki ultimately weakens their collective foundation.\\n\\n\r\nBut they also don\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d the most time; the main cast (Mitsumune, Masaki, and Hayato) do. In other words, the anime simply does not have enough attention to give to roughly thirty separate side characters.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, since the supporting cast impact the anime to such a minimal degree, and since very many of the characters receive next to no attention whatsoever, it\u2019s difficult to argue that Mayoiga did, in fact, do \u201cenough\u201d with them.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily for the anime, its main cast fair better. Not a whole lot better, but they\u2019re an improvement all the same.\\n\\n\r\nMitsumune is the main protagonist. He\u2019s a na\u00efve teen, but he\u2019s a nice guy who is willing to help out those who need it. His best friend is Hayato, his newfound crush is Masaki, and he believes that his time in Nanaki Village will be worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nHis nice-guy persona, however, gets him into trouble when he gets pinned for killing Yottsun, releasing Jack from prison, and being friendly towards Masaki, the most suspicious person in the whole group. The culmination leads to him getting kidnapped and subsequently saved by his crush.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, the anime finally reveals his demon. Growing up, he had a brother named Tokimune. Where Mitsumune behaved like a good kid, Tokimune did not. As a result, Tokimune always received their mother\u2019s love.\\n\\n\r\nOne day, however, Tokimune accidentally dies in a freak accident, causing the mother to break and believe that Mitsumune is actually Tokimune. In order to help his mother and please his father, Mitsumune chooses to \u201cbecome\u201d his brother, forgoing his own identity in the process.\\n\\n\r\nHis whole life, Mitsumune has been \u201csomebody else.\u201d For this reason, he goes to Nanaki Village to simply be himself.\\n\\n\r\nWhile his background is given all at once, it\u2019s an interesting development since it falls in line with Masaki complimenting his name early on and his general good-guy behavior (because that\u2019s simply who he is).\\n\\n\r\nShortly after, Hayato pulls a Mitsumune by unveiling his entire past in a minutes-long speech to Mitsumune. Again, this gross exposition comes off as rather lame, but, given how Hayato\u2019s control of Mitsumune mirrored Hayato\u2019s parents\u2019 control of him, it makes sense why he had acted in such a manner.\\n\\n\r\nTheir argument allows Mitsumune to confront his Nanaki, speak with his father, and learn about what he has left to do. Namely, save Masaki.\\n\\n\r\nFor while everyone believed her to be the culprit, she likewise had problems all her own. Her wanting to go on the trip was to find Reiji, a boy who had essentially looked after her as she grew up.\\n\\n\r\nIt gets revealed (through yet more exposition) that Reiji is not real. That he is, in fact, Masaki\u2019s Nanaki. Thus, for her, she is not supposed to embrace her Nanaki but let it go.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is odd. Nanaki, up until now, had been these monstrous, evil incarnations that needed to be confronted. But Masaki\u2019s is an imaginary friend who not only helped her out her whole life but also needs to be given up. It\u2019s practically a contradiction of the show\u2019s established rules.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, this direction once again aids Mitsumune. Having confronted his own Nanaki, he was forced to leave the village. Yet he wanted to go back in to help out both Hayato and, most importantly, Masaki. So he does just that \u2013 albeit without a bus license and with a bit of convenience.\\n\\n\r\nMitsumune\u2019s actions save Hayato from death, and his kindness towards Masaki allows her to realize that, finally, she does not need Reiji any longer. The show ends with all three leaving the village as stronger people. Both on an individual basis and in the relationships they share with Mitsumune.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, the characters hearken back to that puzzle metaphor. Mayoiga has the pieces there: explanation of Nanaki through its side cast, potential in Mitsumune\u2019s character arc, and the relationships he shares with the two people he cares about most. The problem, however, is that they don\u2019t have the execution necessary to appear worthwhile. The biggest issues being not enough is given about the supporting characters and the delivery of the main cast\u2019s backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track has a nice vocalist and a catchy part in the \u201cdaijoubu\u201d lyric. The piano, guitar, and drums create a strangely optimistic tone, considering the mood of the anime. Like most of the art, it\u2019s not a memorable piece, but it\u2019s still a cool addition to the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track slows it all down. The acoustic guitar and steady drums keep the ED following a methodical pace that carries the audience out of each episode. The singer likewise aids in this endeavor while also adding just a twinge of a bittersweet feeling. One that can only be felt (appropriately enough) at the end of the anime itself. Overall, it\u2019s stronger than the OP but still not all that memorable.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the sound-work, it is very much par for the course. Voice acting sees no notable performances, but the original soundtrack performs better with its surprising amount of compositional variety. Its atmospheric in \u201cKeshi Tai\u201d with its low ambient effects and higher piano notes, happy in \u201cSukkiri\u201d for those (rare) happier moments, and creepy in \u201cNarihibiku Warabe Uta\u201d with its lullaby music box. They may not be very strong tracks, but the OST is at least fitting for the anime\u2019s horror motif.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIs it morbid of me that I wanted to see some death and chaos? Probably somewhat.\\n\\n\r\nBut I won\u2019t lie; that\u2019s what I wanted. Or at least what I was led to believe was going to happen. Shows like that, where people in the cast are systematically picked off one by one, can be quite entertaining. Are my \u201cfavorites\u201d going to make it? In what way will he meet his demise? Did she just trip a flag of some kind?\\n\\n\r\nPart of that belief came from the show\u2019s huge cast. It seemed more than likely that the show was gearing itself up to downsize it, but, alas, that never came to pass.\\n\\n\r\nSo, unfortunately, I didn\u2019t get to really answer those questions.\\n\\n\r\nPutting aside this misplaced expectation of mine, I can\u2019t say I liked any other part of the anime. The cast were more than forgettable \u2013 including the mains. The overall plot was not engaging and not dramatic. The inklings of romance were nice but not fully incorporated.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, one small bit of happiness creeped into the show: Mitsumune\u2019s second Nanaki. The little fur-ball, with its big eyes, pink ribbon, and silly sounds, made the creature a cute addition that I didn\u2019t anticipate. Suffice it to say, if my own Nanaki ever showed up, I hope it would be even half as adorable as this one.\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga, despite the events it depicts, never makes it to where it truly wishes to go. The story is a mess, the art is lacking, and the characters needed more focus than what they were given. The elements are there, and the music is even passable. But it is still not enough to save it from itself. It\u2019s at least better than being jabbed with a needle \u2013 but that\u2019s not saying a whole lot.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, a puzzle-piece set arranged by a toddler\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, okay artistic direction, shoddy CG, okay character designs, and slightly below average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, while the vast majority of the side characters have no impact, and Mitsumune, Masaki, and Hayato\u2019s characters are not handled carefully, traces of competence can be found\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, okay OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, severely uninteresting yet saved by a cute Nanaki\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "Spring is long gone. Some shows are still ongoing and are gr8 (rezero), some shows were breathers (flying witch), and of course, some just pure fanservice (you know which show). One of the most controversial shows of this season, The Lost Village, left people with mixed opinions. Some hated how unlikeable the cast was, while others loved it for that reason. What are my feelings on this show? Well, find out right now. Letsa go ona bus and see for ourselves:\r\nThe story is about 30 people traveling to a place called nanaki village, where they can erase their previous lives and start a new one.However, things are not as they seem. Its a very dumb story, but that just makes it all the more fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing particularly amazing. The character designs get a bit repetitive, but there are some well done scenes. The animation is a little stiff, the cgi could be better, but again, its not bad. Just kinda average.\\n\\n\r\nNothing particular for sound. The soundtrack has nothing worth mention, but the opening is good, though a little lazy since its mostly still pictures. The song is good tho. The ED is relaxing. The voice acting is pretty much average, except for mitsumunes AWFUL voice. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a mixed bag for me. 30 entire characters, yet only like 6 or 7 get any focus. The other billion don't do much, and get no development at all. But, the few that do get focus develop, and have a backstory. In the beginning, I hated mitsumune, but by the end of the series, I liked his character. Becas he has development. \\n\\n\r\nSo, with all of these flaws, why am I giving the show such a high score? Because of how much I enjoy it. Yes, enjoyment plays the biggest factor in anime. If you don't enjoy an anime at least a little, why are you watching? But this series, something about it I just loved. Each episode got better. The plot, while dumb, kept me on the edge of my seat. I enjoyed watching the characters interact with their environment and each other. The ending could've been better though, and theres plenty of room for a season 2. \\n\\n\r\nNow for categorys for the final score crap.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nAnimation: 6\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 7\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.29\\n\r\nMy Score: 8.23\\n\\n\r\nNot for everyone, but those who enjoy it will love it!!!!",

            "content": "A journey of some young people with hard experiences and pasts seeking to find a place where they could start a fresh new start and lead a better life. when I first read the synopsis of this anime I was expecting a great story full of suspense and thrill, unfortunately I was quite disappointed in the end.\r\nThis review might contain some spoilers, or something that could hind to a spoiler, so be alert!\r\nAt first it was quite exciting, people arriving at a mysterious place with a bizarre atmosphere and incidences, later on those people starting to lose they temper when they found themselves confronting thesame thing that were trying desperately to run away from. It was indeed quite thrilling for me in the beginning, but a good beginning doesn't necessarily mean a good anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the main thing that made a letdown impression on me was the characters of this story, first of all; they were too many of them, about 30 or more, so-without a doubt-it was a struggle to keep up with their names, attitudes, personalities and so on, especially since there's only 12 episodes for this anime, secondly; most of the characters were quite annoying, I know this is a matter of perspective, but I can't help but to have a bad impression on the anime when it's full of annoying characters. \\n\\n\r\nI believe it's fair to say that the main theme of this anime was the psychological part, talking about the psychology of mankind is quite hard since even the greatest scientist have a great deal of problems dealings with this aspect, I'm saying this to be clear that I don't quite understand what a \"psychological scar\" is, here almost every character has this scar, and they find themselves confronting something like an embodiment of these scars, and for that they give in for fear and horror... even though they realize that what they're seeing isn't actually real. Here I want to point out my point; personally I don't believe that the human psychic can be frail to this extent, but then again, humans' psychic is quite hard to understand, and my positive opinion about this anime is that they are trying to view the psychic of normal persons, not of some serial killers and psychopath, which the general populace is more concerned about. \\n\\n\r\nContinuing talking about the story, like I said before, it was quite thrilling and interesting in the beginning with high suspense, later on they try some plot twist to make things more interesting (or at least make it interesting again)... which I think they failed at, with the progression of the story I just keep thinking it's getting more and more lame, especially with the characters acting more and more childish for their ages, in the ending it seems like they want us to have some feelings and emotions about some incidents we don't know the first thing about, something I would consider to be too forced. At least the conclusion of this series had a deep message for the viewers so I guess it wasn't a total waste of time after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good, I believe it could've been better if they made it more dark of gloomy, but it's not a horror anime after all, the audio work was good too but nothing special about it, at least there's nothing special I can point out.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment; well I think it was clear from what I previously said, from high suspense to big disappointment in the end, I was expecting this anime to be a hit for the spring season but expectations aren't always met conveniently.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end here's my rating for this anime:-\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

What I could understand watching this is that no matter what happenned in your past, it's still a part of you that you can't just get rid of it. The message of the anime is: \"You can't just get rid of your past. To continue progressing in life, accept your past and get over it. Otherwise, you will stop in time and live a life without being really you.Your past (traumas, regrets, pendences...) is a part of who you are\".",

            "content": "Oh boy, where do I even start with this anime...? \r\nOkay, so let's lay out the basics here. Mayoiga, or The Lost Village, is a Psychological Thriller Anime Directed by Tsutomu Mizushiha. The reason I say that is because that director's name is synonymous with lots of other anime that i consider GREAT, Another, Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan, and Crayon Shin-chan, among others. It's an original series which means they get to play a little fast and loose with the composition and storylines, though I feel like they should not have. But more on that later.\r\nSTORY: 4\r\nThe Premise is pretty simple. It's about the villagers beingattacked by horrific creatures that only they can see. I can accept that as a premise because it's vague enough to take a lot of different places, especially when you address that this is a Horror series. That said, why don't they? this series is filled with bad exposition dumps. they spend so much time building character backdrops and backstory mid-event (one particular event is explaining why a certain character loves guns as she's being chased by a giant hornet) and in VERY LATE (as late as episode 11 of 12) episodes, that at times, I just kind of felt like i was jarred and ripped straight out of the story. Let's not forget that exposition dumps are a supremely bad idea when you have 12 episodes and 30 characters. Let's hit that after the next part, which is:\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 7\\n\r\nThe Art is fine. It's not beautifully animated, but it's not as though the staff worked like they were underpaid. it's about your standard par-for-the-course animation. that is, until we get to the 3D animation. i don't know what it is about studios nowadays, but i feel like most anime viewers unilaterally agree that most 3D rendered animation just looks... bad. The sound however, was great. The voice acting was pretty all over the place, but the audio mixing and use of really good pieces to set the background tone was excellent. Coming from a sound engineer and a Foley artist standpoint, it was immersive enough that nothing broke the story or pulled me out of the experience. hence, both of these receive a 7.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 3\\n\r\nThere were too many of them. Flat-out. Full stop. This anime was 12 episodes long. there are 30 characters. there were so many, and the plot was so all over the place, that upwards of ten characters could have their entire story summarized in one sentence, e.g; \"the fat guy eats, sleeps and is lazy\" \"the couple that elope act like any other lovey-dovey couple\" \"the one bitchy girl and her extremely unremarkable friends\", to name a few. there wasn't even a  real reason for half of them to be there, and some characters that seemed like their stories would be extremely interesting get almost no scree-time at all. The most frustrating bit of it is that some of these backstories were positively fascinating, but were completely arbitrary in that they flesh out the character but don't even lead to any real satisfactory conclusions.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 6\\n\r\nDespite the anime's many pratfalls, when they pulled off explosive events, or revealed twists in the story, it did them incredibly right. Certain storyline twists felt truly unexpected (save for one) and I appreciated that the direction was ballsy enough to lay its cards on the table early in terms of leaving a suspicion available for the viewer to take, and then revealing the suspicion to be completely correct, which I found refreshing, seeing as horror very often presents misdirection as a main selling point. It's not a masterfully crafted chain of events, but the parts it does get right, it pulls off very well.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 5\\n\r\nFor every one thing I liked about this series, I seemed to find two to dislike. I'm not even saying this wasn't entertaining or that I didn't enjoy it overall. I'm simply saying that from a standpoint of what anyone should expect from a good Horror or a well-crafted Psychological Thriller, This anime met you with confusing narrative, an overly ambitious character cast that ended up becoming mostly background decoration after a while, and a truly, truly confusing story line with terrible pacing that seemed to give you the relevant information far past the mark of when you asked for it. It was a very strange experience to see an anime that could have been so good just be so... not.",

I really did try to give this anime a chance, hoping that it only starts out slow and becomes a masterpiece at the end, but I was definitely disappointed by episode 7. The first two episodes definitely had my attention, Mayoiga displays certain hints of mystery, but it's not enough to keep the audience watching. The story itself mid-point was poorly written, there wasn't much mystery or suspense incorporated into the story line, and those that were included were meaningless tothe plot, or just plain out predictable. The artwork was alright in certain episodes, but it just wasn't eye-candy or anything compared to other mystery animes. To sum up this anime, it's not worth watching if you're expecting a masterpiece of a jaw dropping mystery anime.",

I do think that there were too many characters as some of them did gets pushed to the side and were just there, I think it would  have been better if there were a few more episodes so they could develop some of the other charactersmore but overall I really enjoyed it. I was a little disappointed when no one died as I thought that it was going to be a horror in some way but by the ending I had forgotten about that tbh. Overall a decent anime and one I would watch again :) 8/10 from me :) Also love the intro song sooo much!! Also like how they brought the hippopotamus song back at the end, thought that was a nice touch, kind of like it was ending right back at were it began almost like its not over and that its all going to happen again....",

I kept waiting for the death count to happen. Theres more characters then you can count, and its just weird. But oddly enough i kept watching the series for some reason. You want to find out what the hell is happeneing and who's screwing with everyone. Basically the cast have to fight against their fears and their fears manifest into some weird crap. Seriously the monsters here are screwed. Some monsters you just spent 5 minutes tryingto figure out what they are. Like did Picasso do the designs for them?? And a lot of characters didnt get tragic back stories so you wonder ''what the hell are they doing there?\". This was dissapointing, no gorey deaths and no fan service. The only good trait is some scenes are oddly funny, and the idea that everyone has some type of suffering, and the proper thing to do is accept them and move on and not run from it. But theres no reason to see this if you haven't already.",

horror,mystery,psychological and drama genres and It manages to fuck up every one of them,later on I'll further in that claim when I start talking about the story,and it's sad,since I love those genres and those combained could create masterpieces,but since you've guessed it,that's not the case of Mayoiga.\r\nMayoiga's story is pathetic.\r\nAnime original story are really rare on modern anime,it's really weird to watch shows that are not based on a manga,light novel or porn novel,butthey're really ambitious.They try to present new and original stories with can be executed out brilliantly ot can became a flop and Mayoiga falls on the later category.\\n\r\nWe have a really unique premise of a group of people travelling to a village,which according to legends doesn't exist,to start a new life.It's really interesting and very uncommon in anime,since there are not teenagers in a highschool.Moreover,you expect some metaphysical thing like it's the afterlife.The premise is really good,but unfortunatly,the rest is really crappy.\\n\r\nThe pacing is atrocious,we start very slow,like a good mystery does and then it sinks,in favour of showing you crazy people being crazy doing crazy things and the story gets forgotten,then it starts going on circles on the same point \"That character is a witch!1!!!\",\"We must kill her\" getting focused in showing you over the top things,eventually,it becomes a clustterfuck of asspulls and revelations with no point at all.\\n\r\nBut these elements aren't the worst thing that the story has to show you,the worst aspect is the story itself.\\n\r\nI've commented about the originalty of the premise,and the story doesn't have secudary highschools with mobiles phones and rainbow haired characters,unfortunatly,these are its only good aspects.Trying to describe all the atrocites it does to storytelling but let's try it.\\n\r\nThe story starts with our cast going on to a lost village by bus,on the first episode they introduce all the cast and because they're like 25,you won't remember any name,they sing creepy songs and there is a creepy atmosphere going on.On the next episode,the cast reach to the village and there is a mystery about its abandonment because there are some furniture and recient things on the houses,they go to investigate it and someone disappears because he split apart from the group with a gril that he liked,so she gest blamed.From this point the show starts to go downhill so fast and so hard that it hurted.We have a witchhunt,supernatural things that are supposed to be the mental scars,and the idea of fighting your own fears but this concept is made badly since the you can create super mega mosters just because.These beings,also,don't let them go away,but some have,some don't have anmd it's crazy how the work.In addition,the story is full of shock factor and victimazing,showing you the past of some characters \"how the parents hit you while laughing\",\"the world doesn't understand me\",etc.\\n\r\nAt the end of the day,we have a story,that is a dynamic show with the same thriller and pyschological weight like Mirai Nikki,because it tries to be a serious and mature show but it never becomes that it wants to introduce the biggest number of supernatural and over the top elements as it can.\\n\r\nFinally,I want to talk about the ending since it was the final nail on a dead show.They asspull a final boss that turns out to be the researcher of the guy that wanted to stop all the nonsense and rescue everyone,since according to him,you start to lose feelings after staying on the village for to long,and she wanted to create a big moster to help him to regain his feeling,then the monster of the girl that everyone hated appears to help her to make her,the people that you though they were dead,appeared out of nowhere,and some of them united to the final boss that is a cute girl,yes,in the end,some people stayed because they were afraid of coming back to real world and some went to the real world,eventhough,some of them wanted to go away,but don't ask cuestion.\\n\r\nAt the end of the day,we have a show that promised you to be a survival mystery or an unintentional comedy in the likes of Another but ended being a clustterfuck of nonsense and a insult to logic or storytelling\\n\\n\r\nThe art & animation is mediocre\\n\r\nThe animation was handled by Diomedea known for Campione,Noucome,KanColle or Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?\\n\r\nThe art is as bland as you ever hope to be,there is no life in it,they seem to be made on an assembly line without any passion or vision.It's nice to the eye,since it isn't ugly and is indeed kind of moe and cute but there isn't any personality or anything,so,the art is generic and bland but nice to the eye,but to be fair,the monsters are really original and something to stick out of the art,they combine live-action and animation making it really experimental and unique.\\n\r\nThe animation is nothing spectacular,the movements are fluid and the cgi is bad.\\n\r\nThe character designs are bland are really generic,they have nothing special that defins them,the same goes to the backgrounds.\\n\r\nTo sum it up,the art & animation is bland\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nice and is the best aspect of the show\\n\r\nThe OST is really good,on a horror show the OST is not for showing how amazing it's or making epic moments,is there to help to the atmosphere,making it creepy and this soundtrack does it wonderfully,but there's a silly track that ruins the atmosphere with dramatic sounds.\\n\r\nThe OP is really amazing,the visuals are really good,they help to reflect all the psychological conflicts and backdrops of the characters with good metaphores like butterflies.Moreover,the song is really good,so we have here one of the best opening of the spring and you only wish that show would be the same.\\n\r\nThe ED is forgettable,it shows you the characters and it's accompanied by a guitar song which is really relaxing but there is nothing special about it.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is correct.\\n\\n\r\nThe charcters are the worst aspect by far,they are so generic that it's really hard to talk abou them,they fairly one-note and they can be describe in one sentece.\\n\r\nMitsumune is the main character,he has a pure heart and loves Masaki\\n\r\nMasaki is a shy girl that likes Mitsumune,she's messed up.\\n\r\nHayato is a yandere.he loves his best friend,Mitsumune.\\n\r\nKoharun is the \"final boss\",she likes Valkana and she plans to save her dad,most of the show,she's a mystery\\n\r\nDahara is the guide and likes Koharun\\n\r\nValkana is an angry guy,but to be fair,he's the most likeable one and his backdrop has some sense.He's the best character in the show.\\n\r\nLion is your Rei Ayanami clone with some supernatural powers.\\n\r\nLove-pon is crazy as shit,she's really hateable,and you want to punch her on the face.\\n\r\nNanko is a detective,she's really interesting,since he has got some character but she doesn't get fleshed out in any way,so she ends being a likebale supporting character that would be better if she wasn't on this show,like Valkana\\n\r\nMaimai is a tsundere and she like the MC\\n\r\nJack is psycho.\\n\r\nHyouketsu no Judgness is pathetic,he tries to be funny or something but it's annoying\\n\r\nMikage is frustated business man.\\n\r\nNyanta is cat girl that loves guns and the same goes to Jigoku no Gouka (but he is not a cat boy)\\n\r\nManabe and Pii-tan are the \"cute\" couple that is really cheesy.\\n\r\nDozaemon likes to eat and is a NEET\\n\r\nNettaiya is hot blonde girl,so as you expected is dumb as well,because of clich\u00e9s.\\n\r\nThe rest don't have any a clich\u00e9 to define them.\\n\r\nMoreover,the character don't have any development or got flesh out in any way.The maximum amount of care they have is a flashback showing how sad is their life.\\n\r\nIn the end,we have a boring and generic cast with no charm or carisma or anything.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion,Mayoiga is a boring show with a stupid story,bland art,nice soundtrack and a boring and generic cast.It's not even the case of Big Orderi,where is so bad that is funny,is really bad,being funny in stupidness but unfortunatly is not the case,so we have a boring and bad show that's not good even in dumb entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall,I give Mayoiga a 2 out of 10\\n\\n",

Just poof!No problems whatsoever while the MCs had to struggle all the way to accept who they are.It doesn't even show what happens after.\\n\\n\r\nArt(7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was okay most of the time.There were some moments were it was transparent but it was alright.In my opinion the characters looked a bit to young and cute for this genre.The monsters really creeped me out though,they looked realistic sometimes and more to say...disgusting?In some ways I'm surprised made by the same people who worked on Another and sometimes I'm not...\\n\\n\r\nSound(7/10)\\n\\n\r\nIt was average too,I liked the opening but the other sound aspects didn't really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(6/10)\\n\\n\r\nAlthough some of the characters developed quite nicely,most others weren't given too much attention.Like Lion and Nanko,I wanted to know their stories!Part of characters were relatable and I liked how it turned out for Mitsumune and Masaki and the bus driver's story moved me a bit.Heck,Lovepon was annoying and loud but she was captivating the attention of viewers!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(6/10)\\n\\n\r\nI would've given it a 7 if it had a better conclusion but the ending felt very rushed. I couldn't even remember half of the characters' faces,much less their names.As I said,some moments were indeed catchy but a big part of it was so-so.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(6/10)\\n\\n\r\nMy apologies,Mayoiga,but you will probably leave my memory as fast as those guys catched the train.\\n\r\nIf you don't have anything to do,it's a acceptable watch but it's better to leave it at the bottom of the list.(Although good to fall asleep to when you want nightmares)",

            "content": "Mayoiga has probably been the strangest ride of my life, and no, I'm not making a pun here on how it literally starts with a bus ride. Before I begin my review, I'll say this. Mayoiga is the type of anime which is great when you have other people to discuss it with, but not if you're watching this alone. It's best to go into this blind without any spoilers. And don't try to take it seriously. While I'll try hard to not spoil anything, I'd recommend that you go watch the anime before reading the review, and don't do it alone. If you're simplycurious about it, but not enough to go watch it due to the low rating, then read on.\\n\\n\r\nI won't waste time here with the summary. Frankly speaking, I believe that Mayoiga is intentionally bad. Otherwise, I'll be unable to comprehend why anyone managed to make a mess like this. Especially considering the fact that the director of Mayoiga also directed one of my favorite anime, Shirobako.\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga's plot doesn't really make much sense. It's a mystery anime at heart, with the craziest characters and situations. You'll literally go what the heck many times while watching this. As I've already said, it's not meant to be taken very seriously, but enough to make you pay attention to everything. I swear, the amount of wild theories people came up with while it was airing would be enough to make an entire book. \\n\\n\r\nWith a cast as large as 30, it's not really hard to see that it's impossible for Mayoiga to develop them all within 12. The two main characters would probably be Mitsumune and Masaki, but you could also make an argument here that the others were equally important, but let's just consider those two as the main ones here. Despite what I say, Masaki herself is a mysterious and shady character in the beginning, and Mitsumune's the type you'll most likely hate, with his nice guy and naive attitude. There are quite a few other important characters as well, Speedstar, Valkana, Koharun, Lion, Lovepon (miss execution), and a few others whose names I can't remember. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Mayoiga is quite decent. Nothing noticeable, but it did help to set the mood, so it served its purpose well. The animation is average, nothing great, and could've been better, but it was good enough.\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga is probably at its best when you just sit there wondering what the heck happened, and try to come up with theories as to explain what exactly took place, and share it with others, only for it to be blown away next episode. While I certainly enjoyed it, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, except for the reason I've mentioned above. It's unpredictable to the point where you'll have no idea what will it come up with next, and it fills with a weird feeling of wanting to find out. An 8 is probably too generous of a score for this anime, but hey, I believe the main purpose of anime is to entertain, and Mayoiga certainly managed to do that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I think this was a good idea.... a mysterious village where your worst fears are manifested....but it was not well executed... it was not well written..at times it just felt chaotic and at the closing episodes it was rushed and had a not so exciting end. I felt disappointed.. I was tugged along desiring for questionsto be answered...but the answer felt insignificant and unimportant. The story was so bad...it felt like the writers were writing and making additions every week lol. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was good for the most part....except when they used CG....like why....why do that... it was horrible.\\n\\n\r\nThe only part of the show i really looked forward to was the opening theme song and animation.

            "content": "Mayoiga was probably one of the few anime that stood out to me in the Spring 2016 season. And I don't mean that in a positive way. Looking back at the show now, I think Mayoiga was the worst anime I have ever completed. What started off as a intriguing mystery show ended as a clusterf*ck of \"wtf\"s and \"omg\"s.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story follows a cast of 30 (i think?) individuals as they travel to the mythical Nanaki Village on a bus tour. Each of the 30 individual all want to escape their previous lives and start fresh in Nanaki. When they eventually arrive at Nanaki Villagethey find it completely abandoned. As they stay longer in this village, strange things start to happen. People start going missing, mysterious creatures start appearing aaaaaand..... I won't spoil anymore than that. But from that little synopsis I wrote up, Mayoiga seems pretty interesting, right?\\n\\n\r\nThat's what I thought as well but I never thought I would've been so disappointed by this show. The main problem I had with the story was that too many things were happening at once and these things were practically left unexplained or just touched upon. This made the story quite hard to understand at times and made the show seem a lot more confusing than it really was. \\n\\n\r\nThe mystery aspect of the show really bugged me as well. This show made me think that there was going to be a big plot twist sooner or later because of the slow build up. And to be honest, half-way through the show, that was the only thing that made me keep watching Mayoiga. In the end, did I get my big plot twist or story climax after all that suspense and building up? \\n\r\nNope.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of Mayoiga was actually somewhat good. Character designs were decent (Lion tho <3), background scenery helped add to the mysterious atmosphere of the show and the animation was okay. The only thing that I had a problem with was the 3D animation. It just felt so out of place and just looked bad in general.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, the OP and ED were good but weren't really anything special. The OST helped give the show suspense but again it wasn't anything special and was easily forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nNow this is where Mayoiga really messes up. As I mentioned before, this show had 30 characters, this was a really dumb choice on the writers' part, in my opinion. 30 characters in a 12 episode series? Seriously? None of the characters in the show had any significant development because of the short screen time they had to share amongst the large cast. None of the characters had anytime to the shine and eventually they get become so boring and forgettable that you just don't care about them anymore.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the ridiculously large and undeveloped cast, these characters' personalities are just soooo unlikeable. And on top of unlikeable personalities, these characters did and said some of the dumbest things I could've imagined. I was so close the dropping this show, like EXTREMELY close. I could not handle the stupidity and ridiculousness of some of these characters. Honestly, it was like these characters were inept at using any form of logic.\\n\\n\r\nHere's an example:\\n\\n\r\nEveryone: MISAKI IS A GHOST BCZ IDK !!!!!11!!TIE HER UP!!11!bdwbfbBYUVUY EXECUTEHERRRRRR\\n\r\nSpeedstar: *cuts Misaki*\\n\r\nMisaki: *bleeds*\\n\r\nEveryone: Well i guess she's not a ghost since she's bleeding\\n\r\nHiyato (or whatever his name is): JFC MISAKI IS OBVIOUSLY A GHOST AND SHE'S BEHIND EVERYTHIINNGGG!!!1! WHY DOES NO ONE UNDERSTAND ME kyuUkvUK I HATE EVERYONE blah blah blah\\n\r\nMitsumune: Leave Misaki alone! She's not the type of person to do all this!\\n\r\n*Bus guy almost runs over everyone with the bus and kidnaps Misaki*\\n\r\nBus dude: WHERE TF IS MY DAUGHTER?!?!\\n\r\n*starts crying*\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nTo say the least, I did not enjoy this show. More specifically, I didn't like the characters of this show. Though the show was able to build the suspense to the supposed plot climax, in the end it didn't deliver and it felt very anti-climatic.\\n\r\nBuuut to an extent, I did slightly enjoy Mayoiga. I enjoyed it in a way that it was so bad that it was good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5 (below average)\\n\r\nArt - 7 (good)\\n\r\nSound - 7 (good)\\n\r\nCharacter - 1 (garbage)\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2 (still garbage)\\n\r\nOverall - 4.4/10 - Would not recommend \\n\\n\r\nUgh it's 5AM, I'm tired. Why am i still awake... \\n\r\nAnyways...\\n\r\nThank you for putting up with this rant/review.\\n\r\nPeace (\u0e51\u02c3\u0335\u1d17\u02c2\u0335)\u0648\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mayoiga is a somewhat schizophrenic anime. Sometimes it try's to be a Psychodrama. Other times it tries to be a Perma-Death Mystery/Horror. Both times it fails, Sometimes literally. I feel if it had stuck to one concept, it could have been amazing either way. As other reviewers have said, this anime is the epitome of wasted potential.\r\nA big issue with this anime was its huge caste of characters and how their characterization was handled. \r\nThe show follows just two of the thirty characters closely, half-way develops 13 more, and leaves the rest as a bunch of mooks that no one cares about. This would befine if the show stuck to it's initial Mystery/Horror Presentation. The partially developed characters could be used to create and maintain tension. But they aren't used. They get introduced and then are just kinda... there. This is particularly annoying when random characters become interesting or sympathetic, only to then be ignored for the rest of the show. \\n\r\nHalf way through the show takes a 180 and tosses out any mystery elements it had, and goes full psychodrama. By then though, we don't have enough well defined characters to make a psychodrama work. The Half-Defined characters who are still just glorified paper cut-outs take center stage and it stops making sense and falls apart. It's disappointing here because the show touches on some of the most terrifying features of human psychology, but is never able to explore them. Had the show spent more time with the 4-6 arguably most important characters and left the rest as background fluff, this psychological approach could have worked gloriously even without the mystery bits left in-tact.\\n\\n\r\nTo touch on art and sound, as far as art was concerned it was good, but didn't particularly impress me or add a whole lot. I think I would give it a somewhat better score if the story it was supposed to be complementing was more focused on mystery and horror, but it lacks the meaningful symbolism needed to really bring the psychological aspects of the story to life, despite ample and obvious opportunity.\\n\r\nI was disappointed in the sound department. Granted, The Voice actors were clear and believable, and soundtrack wasn't terrible, maybe even a little catchy at times...\\n\r\nIt was the sound of the monster...\\n\r\nJust... Such an important part of the story... and the sounds that it made were just aweful. They Were Generic. Uninspired, and at times didn't fit. It just smacked me in te face every time I heard it.\\n\\n\r\nStrangely, despite the issues with the story, characters, and sound, I still enjoyed watching this. There's some decent humor, gloriously bad puns, and genuinely tense moments. Sure, said moments don't generally resolve in a satisfying way, but at times the way the devolve can be outright absurd can be considered comically bad, if you're into that kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I don't regret watching this. It's a mess of an anime, but I enjoyed the ride at least.\\n\r\nI don't know if I'm completely comfortable recommending it, but if you literally have nothing better to do, and have appreciation for bad, cheesy entertainment, go for it. You just might enjoy yourself.",

            "content": "Summary in short: Mayoiga is a prime example of a series that COULD'VE been interesting, COULD'VE been engaging, and COULD'VE gotten a much better reception.  This series became, however, a prime example of a series worthy of four cours of episodes shoved into one.  As a result, the story felt contrived, the mystery elements existed purely in ultimately pointless shock attempts and being unable to connect with characters, the viewer could care less about more than half of the cast, and the entire package just felt flat.\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nTL;DR: With too few episodes, you can't relate to the cast members, the end of thestory comes off as random and contrived, and you can't logically deduce what's going on.  The series tries to advertise itself through various weak techniques to be something it's not, resulting in a sour resolution that leaves the viewer unsatisfied.\\n\\n\r\nLong Version:\\n\r\nI knew from the start that I was watching a story by Okada Mari (writer of Another).  As Another is an infamous animated example of a horror//mystery/thriller series gone comedy, my expectations were lower than usual for a series of the genre.  Even so, the premise of Mayoiga interested me greatly: a bunch of screwed up people stuck together in a village that no one can find.  It's the perfect setting for a massacre!  Unfortunately, horror wasn't a tag for this series, so I'd just have to live with the suspense of people possibly getting killed off screen.  Even more unfortunately, I didn't get that either.\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga's story suffered from two primary aspects: lack of time and improper presentation.  With the series introducing a cast where (almost) everyone has some type of psychological scar that resulted in them literally running from the real world, the series automatically set itself up for over 30 episodes assuming you dedicated an episode per character.  With such a huge cast, it takes a lot of time and episodes to get the reader to sympathize or empathize with them.  Apparently this was an understood problem, since the series basically ignored most of the characters and combined them as an angry and paranoid mob for most of the story.  It would have been smarter to NOT introduce most of the characters at that rate.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the presentation was completely awry.  After watching the first episode, I was honestly confused how it WOULDN'T be a horror series.  We have a bunch of crazies stuck in a village with apparently a monster, and one character has already possibly been knocked out.  With only 12 episodes, how could this NOT be horror when half the cast needs to be killed off to make time for the main characters?  As the series goes on, we encounter creepy camera angles, spontaneous sound effects, cliche lines, and facial expression shots that attempt to make us wary of the \"dark side\" of the series.  At the climax of each point of tension, however, the series just lays out a character backstory, shift in character relations, or a pat on the head telling us everything's okay.  The final three episodes attempted to wrap up the series in a sort of moral that I honestly enjoyed.  It was just done so poorly so randomly that it's completely off-putting.  Had I had 60+ episodes to really learn about each of the characters as they attempt to live within the confines of this abandoned village while avoiding the monster that won't enter it, I could actually buy the end of the series and say I felt something from this series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR: Everything was placed where it should be.  CG had it's decent moments and it's horrible moments.  Other than CG, the art probably won't stand out either in a good or bad way.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art was nothing fantastic, it wasn't horrible either.  Some people may dislike the radical character designs, but I appreciated how each character was so easy to identify; I knew every character's name by the end of the first episode, a rare feat for me with a cast of over 30 characters.  While the color palette and overall design made the series feel a bit dated, characters rarely if ever had anatomical issues and no character was so extreme it was off-putting.  I appreciated the CG at times, I hated it at others.  The biggest issue with the CG is that it was almost completely limited to the Nanaki and the bus, resulting in a weird effect that could possibly be intentional but feels for the most part uncomfortable.  I very much enjoyed the range of facial expressions throughout the series, something about which I was expecting greatly due to the psychological nature of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR: OP didn't fit the mood of the series, ED was hindered greatly by its accompanying visuals, and OST was generally unnoticeable.  Love the voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nI'm the type of person who hates skipping the OP and ED of a series.  I only lasted two episodes before I starting skipping both for this series.  Mayoiga's OP is upbeat, emotional, and driving; an exact contrast to the mood of the series.  I plan to acquire the OP, as I enjoyed it.  When watching the series, however, it only made me realize just how slow and uneventful Mayoiya was even at its \"high tension\" points.  The ED fits the series much more, as it was quiet, simple, and slow.  Unfortunately, the visuals were even more quiet, simple, and slow.  Providing only still images of around three characters per episode, there is nothing to engage the viewer to watch the ending unless they really like the song.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST gave me a better impression than the title songs, but still had little impact.  Only one particular soundtrack, the track played in the most tense parts of the series, comes to memory.  On the other hand, I never felt annoyed or distracted by any of the tracks.  Overall, the soundtrack did its job to keep away the awkwardness of a silent background while failing to provide any significant influence to the mood of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe great part of the sound and my favorite part of the series was the voice acting.  While I have had issues really being able to enjoy the characters themselves, the voice actors did a great job amplifying the \"template\" provided to them.  From the fantastic one-liners from Nanko to the vomit-inducing lovey-dovey talk of Manbe and Piitan, I think the seiyuu did the show a great service with their performances.  I can't blame them for the poor use and development of characters, especially since the only thing making those flat and static characters enjoyable for me really were the voices.  Good work, seiyuu!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Cast size was significantly over-capacity for a single cour series, and the series' usage of said cast was poor as expected.\\n\\n\r\nOne glance at the Characters tab in MAL's page for Mayoiga shows the sad state of the cast in this series.  In the first episode, we're introduced to almost every single character in the series in addition to some type of quirk or personality trait they have due to the nature of the introduction.  But despite this, you only need to care about less than a third of them.  Around 5 have true significance to the story, growth, or deeper character, another 10 only serve as motors for plot or directors for the remaining 15 or so that are literally driven by the plot to be taken out of the spotlight more.  When I look at this series aside Durarara!!, a series that managed a large cast and gave them characters that meant something to the viewer with mastery, it's easy to see that those in charge of the series knew they needed to throw aside most of them to get anywhere with the plot.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the tactic of creating centralized characters around which the others would function is a standard and practical option, Mayoiga failed to do it well.  The fundamental design of each character in the cast is a very bland, stereotyped, and predictable.  Anyone with some anime on their belt can use the physical appearance, lines, and behavior toward others to figure out the \"template\" of each character.  The series tried to emphasize those traits by inserting as many random lines and camera shots on individual characters as possible, resulting in a stale appearance for all of them.  With the quick creation of factions in the plot, the cast should have been generalized by their combined modus operandi rather than given continued individual moments in the spotlight.  The best way I can explain how this series treated its cast was by trying to give them all participation trophies.  Durarara!! had a total of 5 cours, and it still had to mitigate many characters to the sidelines for long periods of time.  By attempting to highlight every character for half the series, a great amount of time was wasted and the viewer came to hate most of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nOn the better side, the characters that were highlighted had some good points.  The psychological scars we were shown are mostly general issues, ones with which viewers could quite easily relate.  If the series gave more time to the overall plot and to explaining each character's issues, I think the cast could have been quite loveable.  Unfortunately, most characters are given more time yelling angrily than providing backstory, resulting in most of the cast being little more than cardboard walls who have petty issues.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: I hoped for the full potential of the series, held severely low expectations, and enjoyed the little things.\\n\\n\r\nI came into the series both with hope for a great time and understanding of its likely failure.  Because of this, I wasn't bothered that much by the poor plot or character abuse.  I look to the characters much more than a plot for enjoyment, and, with such a huge cast, it was impossible I wouldn't enjoy the series.  Despite how bland most of the cast ended up, I found enjoyment in the small quips and one-liners many of the characters popped out, no matter how predictable or cliche they were.  I fundamentally held on to the plot only because I was legitimately curious what was happening.  While I expected the answers to be contrived, I wanted to know them nonetheless.  As the art and music were around average, they didn't improve or hinder the experience.  Half the time, I'm pretty sure I enjoyed making fun of bad characters while the other half I spent enjoying watching a character I hated run in fear or have a temper tantrum.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: While the plot was horribly executed and the characters poorly managed, Mayoiga completed its production with average art, animation, and sound quality.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I don't think I could easily recommend Mayoiga to a friend, I do not think the series as a whole is terrible.  The only real complaints I can make with this series are its contrived plot and poor usage of characters.  For some people, that may be the death of the a series.  I personally can respect that the series finished without production issues: the art, animation, and sound quality remained consistent, episodes were released on time, and they gave an actual resolution to the series.  Yes, I don't like how the series ended, but it did, and that's more than can be said about most one cour series that have come out in the last 10 years.  If you can sit down with friends, have a few too many drinks, and enjoy a fun time watching crazies be crazy, give Mayoiga a watch.",

            "content": "Well, this anime was an absolute trainwreck. Honestly, i've never expected so much of a series and have it so completely fail to meet even my lowest expectations. \r\nStory (5/10) The premise really drew me in, as it stood out from all the other anime airing in its season. Wide range of eccentric characters? Lots of room for character development? Mysterious abandoned village? Sign me the fuck up!\r\nUnfortunately, it completely missed the mark. The plot points were all of a sudden just slapped in our faces, along with weird sudden flashbacks and shitty development. Literally every scene in this goddamn anime was just the charactersarguing with each other then PLOT POINT and then the character arguing about the plot point like??? okay\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10) Unremarkable. The art did it's job, it didn't really impress me that much, however I added a few points just for the animation of the Nanakis. It did a pretty good job of portraying the horrific grandma, and even made the toy penguin look pretty terrifying. \\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10) The sound kind of reminded me of Another, which I personally didn't like. It ramped up the drama sometimes, but it kind of got stale for me after a few episodes (however I know quite a few people liked the soundtrack, this is just my subjective opinion)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (2/10) Oh man. This is where they fucked up BIG TIME. I have NEVER seen such a huge collection of annoying characters in my history of watching anime. They possessed no fucking common sense, instead of sitting down and talking about how to deal with things in a reasonable manner, they all panic and argue. The main character Mitsumune was incredibly annoying (although he did become more interesting after his backstory was revealed, HOWEVER considering his backstory I thought he'd be a lot more messed up? Not going to spoil but he's got to have some major identity-related issues which i hoped they'd explore in the anime but they didn't. There was absolutely no/minimal character development involved - everyone stayed idiotic until the very end. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3/10) God knows how I stayed watching until the very end. The only parts of the anime I enjoyed were the scenes where the characters experienced suffering. I held out hope that at least half of the cast would die a horrible death befitting their incredible stupidity, however alas, it was in vain. How dare they build up such a cast of annoying characters and not even give us the satisfaction of them dying slowly and painfully. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10) This anime drew us all in with an interesting premise, however completely shat on it's own potential. How they fucked up such a promising series, I'll never know.",

            "content": "So, I'm writing this without reading a single comment made by anyone else or any reviews so far (might update it later to sort of 'reply' to statements that I think might need to be 'replied' to in the actual review, but for now...) - I do this since I realize that due to a variety of factors including, perhaps, bad moods, people's comments can truly ruin enjoyment for others (for some reason discovered this in sports anime, wonder if that reason has anything to do with a certain hormone...)  - but, inevitably, I did notice the score, which I now resolve to somehowblock for all other series, at least until I finish them; reading comments and reviews could still be useful, but only after IMO so as to not mar one's raw perception of a series. So, let's begin...\\n\\n\r\nNo, I've literally no idea why it's rated so low (and this, remember, even lower than that gore personified 'Corpse Party' (literally in the title), sure, not 7, but not as low as this either, and that hasn't 1/10 of the narrative), let's get this out in the open... then again, no idea why Another, its most 'recced', is rated so high either, see my rec for more about the comparison, this will focus on 'Mayo' itself mostly...\\n\\n\r\nSo, I was wondering throughout, maybe the twitchy characters annoyed some people? (Other series have them, personalities are best diversified.) The bus driver 'tsking' perhaps?! (Hey, it did annoy one character from the anime)... the songs? But I thought it was cute-creepy at best, and the latter at least is the point of the 'horror' genre (also, the combination can be done excellently as shown in Paranoia Agent).\\n\\n\r\nIt's not like I think this is the best series ever, or even the best horror (apparently Parasyte impressed me quite a bit years ago, I think for reasons similar to Shiki, but kind of forgotten now, and more recently the latter was a marvel of moral subtlety), I'm not sure I ever felt compelled to review anything I gave a 7 to, but I can't fathom (until I read and reply to others anyway, but for now it's raw perception evaluation time)... why, I wonder yet again? Oh, a more likely candidate perhaps, since people tend to be finicky when it comes to CGI even in other series... so maybe they didn't like the bus? Well, no, perhaps more likely the designs of the 'monsters'...\\n\\n\r\nBut... it was entirely the point. And here's where it might get into spoiler territory, so don't read this paragraph perhaps if you haven't finished... it was entirely appropriate that the 'monsters' (the ' is relevant considering their ethereal status) were designed like hellish aberrations... they were, almost literally, nightmares from people's minds. What do you see when you have a nightmare? Or any dream at all... amalgamations of whatever... right? And so it was in this anime. Why, how is it irrelevant that the prof's Nanaki had papers overflowing above it? (Haven't read any comment saying this so far but lately I try to imagine what's highly 'upvoted' among comments based on previous ones I read, and hey, if people highly upvote something on Kuroko's 'expressing' a desire for a 100% win rate (due to, of all things in context, misogyny), people agreeing that \"papers have nothing to do with researchers!\" would probably still make sense in their minds.) It's entirely the point! Colleagues made fun of his research and so externalized his own fear... now, sure, that one specifically wasn't designed to be aesthetically as perhaps 'unpleasant' as the others, but it only appeared for a few seconds, and barely moved its limbs, whereas Hayato's granny had quite a chase (and a horrid past to reflect the monstrous outer manifestation)... you also saw how the protagonist at first had an ugly, deformed penguin that had half its face as if blown off... but at the end it became more the size of the original toy, and then some fuzzball reflecting the person's feelings towards the female protagonist... it's the point, and not bad CGI at all. If they all looked cute from the beginning would this series have a higher rating?\\n\\n\r\nBut... it did also, admittedly, not explore its full potential, but that is natural when one has this number of episodes. What it did explore, though, primarily sociology and psychology, I thought it did well... it was almost as sociologically 'advanced' as Shiki (with the amount of characters and their group's dynamics)... their fast back-and-forth exchanges were quite entertaining, the first episode particularly highlighting their personalities. With regards to psychology, for someone with an active interest in the subject, I thought it animated various concepts well, and while other series also address such topics often while not even mentioning the overall area of study, in this case it made sense to be explicit due to the narrative. Also, why would anyone dislike a song about hippopotamii?!\\n\\n\r\nWell, ultimately, art is subjective, and scores come after the series is completed, so in the future people can still watch it... ideally by not knowing any average indexes, but at least I haven't personally read reviews for a long time before ending something, since there is no point in someone else describing it for someone who hasn't watched it (even my review is clearly more suited to those who completed it, but apart from one paragraph I'm trying to argue, still, that this series is more than worth watching even for someone undecided) and if all they go on is a number then, I guess, this anime is never seen by those except for people who do not care for mere numbers, words, or even hide everything until the end.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately... I've certainly enjoyed this way, far more than the 'other' series it's compared to mostly... and 'Mayo' not only has better escapist fantasies, but they make sense too as opposed to 'uh, just happens'... but, oh, it might have been too complex perhaps for the 'average' viewer? Not absolutely perfect even narratively, once again, but certainly better than some Final Destination clone...",

            "content": "So I think I just watched a 12 episode fan fiction or something called Mayoiga. Seriously guys this show was less unintentionally funny and less interesting then Ousama Game (Kings Game) and that was already bad. The most memorable part of this series for me is the opening song. It is catchy and has a completely different vibe from the show which isn't surprising since this show is one huge mess.        The premise is 30 young people take a bus trip to a mysterious village to start their lives over. Ok not the most original idea ever butI can work with it sure. It devolves into omg she's a ghost so let's have a witch hunt into why won't you be my puppet boy main character oh why. Then it just kind of ends....like a character says let's leave and the credits roll....I seriously thought I missed something multiple times while watching this series of it gives you an idea how sloppy this was put together. The biggest sin of them all is a HUGE SPOILER SO LOOK AWAY NOW..............................................no one dies. Not a single character. No satisfying gore and mayhem to make up for the lunacy. It's pure psychological comedy.  You got me good Mayoiga.",

            "content": "Mayoiga. A anime where there is so much things that I can criticize about this anime. First off, the main character. He is definitely the most annoying character I ever saw in a anime. He literally tries to help everyone he see and always tries to get close to his crush. Like, I get it. You want to get closer to your crush. But he do it in a way that make us viewers cringe. When his crush said she wanted to go to bathroom he responded \"Do you want me to go with you?\"\r\nI see that he's trying to be kind but it justmake him look like a complete pervert. Because of him, I changed one of the condition for a good anime to \"It has to have a good main character.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing I can say about this anime is the characters. There's literally like forty characters! And you don't even get a proper flashback about their past! Only like two through five minutes flashback for three or five characters! Pathetic.  By the way, almost all of them is weird! A psychopath crazy over execution, a chuunibyou, a girl who says she can tell who is gonna die, etc. I can only see one person who had a proper reason to come to the Lost Village. She was trying to save her father! Now that's a proper reason to come to a place like that.\\n\\n\r\nThird thing that I can say about this anime is the plot and the main idea of this story. To be honest, I actually like the plot. Although the main character kinda ruins it, I still like it. (I would've like it more if the main character was better.) The plot is about forty young people going to a undiscovered village based on a urban legend to start a new life. Although we didn't get to see everyones trauma but, I'm pretty sure all of them carries a dark past so because of that past they decided to start a new life in a undiscovered village. Once they reach the village they learned that it was not like what the urban legend says and they learn a terrifying truth about that village. And I like it because it's misterius. When I saw the monster or the nanaki I was like \"What the heck is that?\" And it left me confusing for the rest of the episode until it got explained.\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth thing I can say about this anime is how the story keep up with all forty characters.\\n\r\nThere's literally a character who doesn't do anything but rest and eat. I wonder why the author of this story made so many characters? Its obvious that it's gonna be hard to keep up with all forty characters. It gets to a point where two character goes missing and they don't come back until the last part. For me, these kind of actions shows that it was hard for the author to keep track of all forty characters so he had to eliminate some.\\n\\n\r\nAnd last but not least, conclusion. To be honest this anime had the worst characters I have seen. But it has a really good plot for me. But, I think there is too much cliffhanger in this anime. AND these crappy characters didn't even fix the problems that some of the characters got in the last part of the story! Um, MITSUMUNE WHERE ARE YOU? WHY ARE YOU NOT HELPING THEM? I THOUGHT YOU ARE A KIND OF A GUY WHO WOULD HELP EVERYONE. \\n\r\nAnyways, its fine. At least they tried to help. Based on this paragraph this anime earns a four out of ten for me.",

This theme could be improved and create a really good story.\r\nAt first, Mayoiga is really good. How they survive, the challenges and things that happens. But, the story reveal the 'villain' too easily. I don't know if it just me, but I could tell who set everything up in few firsts episodes.\r\nThe ending is themost disappointing part. It has no impact at all. Like when you're in the middle of writing an essay or story, then got bored or tired or lost on track in what you're writing, then you just quickly sum everything up in few paragraphs which there should be a lot more going on.

            "content": "This review contains no major spoilers, and probably not even minor spoilers, everyone's definition on a minor spoiler is debatable. \r\nI am writing this review because I feel bad for this anime. My ratings and opinion are not raised because of the hate this anime gets, just to be clear.\r\nWhen this anime finished on all anime forums and websites people were hating on it. Saying it's the worst anime they've seen. It eventually turned into a \"bandwagon\" of hate. While this of course is not the best anime in the world, it is far from worst.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story is good, I really like the ideaand concept of it, that's what drove me to watch it in the first place. I am usually not big on psychological anime, but the idea of it was enough to buy me into it. I rate it a 7/10 because I feel the story was not at it's maximum potential. Many spots it is hard to follow, but makes it clear later. Some people may like that, I'm not big on it. But I still think the story is an overall 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI usually dislike seeing CGI/3D in anime, with cars and such, but I felt it worked well enough in this anime. There are also other CGI things in it that I feel stood out a bit but maybe it was too much for them to draw it or something. The style is pretty generic/normal, which is 100% fine with  me. The backgrounds are full of detail and atmosphere which is what boosted it to a 9 for me\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nNot too much to say about the sound, I don't remember any music from the anime, to be honest. I do remember the sound design in certain areas(don't want to spoil) was top notch and was done very very well. This area doesn't need to be extremely high for an enjoyable anime though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nIn my opinion, a set of characters is usually what makes or break an anime to me. This anime did OK with characters, although I let it slide because it has a good excuse. There is 30 characters. There is not enough time to develop them. Even if it focused on just a few, it would feel like the others are pointless. I know that's still not a good excuse to not try harder on the characters but I think this time it doesn't hit the overall score as hard for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI got a lot of enjoyment out of this anime. My unwritten motto is basically something like \"Nothing else matters in an anime as long as you enjoy it. The characters could be drawn like garbage, the music could be someone screaming in a kazoo for all I care, my enjoyment overthrows all other ratings\". I expected a bit more from this anime as far as enjoyment, but I was not 'disappointed'.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nI do not regret watching this anime at all. I think it is worth the time to, especially since it's different and a good story idea. I think most of the hate is undeserved, and while I may have rated this anime a bit too high overall, I stick by it. I only recommend if the story interests you. But it most certainly doesn't deserve the hate it has gotten and is still getting.\\n\\n\r\nGive it a shot and see for yourself before dismissing it so quickly because of the hate.\\n",

Starting this anime without knowing the genre surprised me, as I thought this would be a light-hearted plot, but it got deeper and deeper as the characters' stories unfolded. Indeed there needed to be a huge character-flaw for this to work, because after all they are trying to escape from the world that's different from them. (People who haven't been through the sense of rejection from society, or had been hurt emotionally or physically wouldn't want to seek refuge in an unknown place, at least not for me.)And that kept me sticking close my screen, opening one episode after another, hoping to understand what actually was going on and why they were experiencing different things. The more I watched, the more I thought that the plot was pretty clever. I hope people don't depend fully on the ratings but give this anime a chance. I'm glad I did.",

            "content": "For as far as i've seen not many people liked Mayoiga , also the score isn't very high which was why I dropped this anime two times before actually giving it a chance. I think that it is very underrated, and of course not many people liked it because it is so different than other animes and gives off a sort of bad not intentional comedy feeling, but you should give it a chance and look at it with an open mind. It should have a bigger score than 5.8 . I decided to watch it because I ran out of horror animes to watch.I'd like to say that this in fact is NOT a horror anime, it's not scary, it's not creepy, it's not bloody, so it was kind of a huge let down. Story is all over the place. I liked the first idea, group of people who don't know each other are going to a place where they can start a new life, when they arrive no one is there, strange things start to happen etc. It excels in creating an eerie mood through audiovisuals. Settings are mysterious and gives off bad vibes, I enjoyed that mysterious feeling. That was cool, that could've been a good  story. I strongly connect this anime with a popular show \"Lost\" , and these two are very similar, which is why I liked this anime. The main character is pretty small and weak, filled with bright hope and hero feelings, which is very familiar to us because it's so cliche. You could say that the whole group are bunch of complete idiots who have so many shit crazy ideas and jump to conclusions so fast it makes you question humanity. The ending, the whole thing about \"monsters\" was so bad I planned on dropping it for the third time. But despite that I found this anime really interesting, it's that kind of anime that you can't just leave when you start watching, so you finish it in one sitting because you just have to see what happens next. It definitely doesn't deserve all the hate. But you should watch it ,see for yourselves and decide how you liked it. I give it overall score 8.",

On MAL as well this anime is pretty hated which is pretty weird cause if an anime has a low rating on MAL I almost never like it but for this anime, I found that I didn\u2019t hate it. In fact, I was looking for things to hate while watching the show because I thought I was missing something. \r\nA huge trope of the survival anime is the Lord of The Flies, building factions type of thing and in this one, near the end, the factionswere very interesting. Not to do with persecution or anything to do with sadism/wanting to kill others but in  two factions of people that were willing to deal with their fears to get out of the place they were stuck in and people that succumbed to sloth and fear. In the beginning it was more like a normal survival anime but they switched it up, which is pretty brave. Most survival animes have very few people that actually survive because a lot of the point is to introduce unlikeable characters and get rid of them, which is one strategy to focus on a select few characters. In here there is less of that waste of characters. If you don\u2019t like a character or set of characters, most likely they aren\u2019t going to disappear anytime soon. \\n\\n\r\nThe main reason I found this anime to be good, however, is the backstory of the Lost Village. A lot of events made more sense, including the reason why people even come to the Lost Village and why its called that. It created depth to the story and looking at the situation logically, there might be a solution to getting out of the Village that depends on the characters themselves, which really led to exploring and testing characters in non-trivial way. By the end, I ended up not really hating anyone, and in fact feeling bad for some which I think is the mark of a good show. \\n",

This time however, I was extremely disappointed in the lack of bashing. Mayoiga, has proven to be the reason I'm almost bald from questioning the logic and horrible decision making. The concept seemed  extremly promising, and i was looking forward to being scared here and there. But that was as good as it got. The show itself is the biggest piece of trash i've ever had the ill faith to see, even sharknado had a better story.Mayoiga gave me the chills thinking that someone actually took the time to write and animate it. 100/10 do not recommend, wish i could rate this negative.",

            "content": "Well...I already reviewed one of the Spring Anime Bombs might as well review the other.\r\nHello People I am Josh and today I am reviewing the anime Mayoiga (Lost Village) brought to us by Diomedia who....I am definently not familiar with at all....Let's jump into it.\r\nStory- The story is brought to us by the same man responsible for Another, a decent to good horror anime (fuck the last episode though). Because of that people immediately went into to this anime thinking there would be some horrifying things and blood being spilled everywhere. But I am here to tell you that that is wrong. It is nota horror mystery anime. It is a Psycholgical Surreal...Comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe story sounds good on paper. The story being about 30 people going to a lost village to 'start over' in life for a variety of reasons. But when they get to the village strange things start to happen and they will have to face there Nanaki or Psycholgical scars. Going by that alone people might of thought it might be horror but it is really just a psychological surreal comedy. First 3-4 episodes are okay for the most part but then it goes down hill from there especially with the last episode having a stupid anti-climatic ending. Won't spoil that though.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art is good, characters designs are fine. But then there are the inner monsters of these people....dear god. The CGI used in this anime is just....Wow. Wow! I swear I laughed my ass off every time one of these monsters appear just because of how stupid they looked or how they moved. This is what makes the show a comedy for the most part. The way these CGI monsters look will make you laugh your ass off. I swear I almost thought the people responsible for the CGI in Skeltar Heaven and the Guy who made Utsu Musume Sayuri were paid to do it (For all I know they could have somehow been involved.) \\n\\n\r\nSound- The sound oaky to me but it fits the anime well and the voice actors are good. I got no major complaints with this one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- This anime has way to many characters. 30 characters in a 12 episode show will not work the main reason being half to about the majority of the characters will be pushed to the side. I did not like one single character in this anime. Not the MC, not the love interest, Mr. Driver (Dude seriously didn't get a name. He is just called Driver....Yet they can give some of these characters funny names.) The Lion girl interested me a little but I didn't care for her in the end. To there credit they do atleast develop the MC, Hayato, The Driver and the Love interest but the rest...Ha! They are all just saying \"Whatever is this thing called character development. We have never heard of it.\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- It was pretty average. The only thing mainly keeping this score average was the laughable CGI and how I laughed my ass off every freaking time it came up. Especially with one of the monsters being Thomas the Tank Engines brother who only comes to Sodor when they need to scare some kids.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- People say Big Order was the bad but that was just boring to me. This is just something I have deemed something that I'll go back to if I feel like laughing at crappy CGI monsters. The plot is bad and goes down hill after atleast the first 3-4 episodes, there are way to many characters for an anime this short. A majority if not all the characters are forgettable and they even try to develop some but fail miserably. If you ask me...Go into this as a comedy. Think of it as a comedy. But overall this anime is pretty bad as the genere that it is listed.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, peace people",

            "content": "I would like to personally thank all who have decided to read this review. It is my first one posted to My Anime List; and, coming from a lifelong anime fan, you can be sure that this series had a very *special* impact on me, such that it served as a personal summons to this forum that I- for some reason- had not yet registered to after all this time. For that, Mayoiga, I thank you. A well-established anime fan should not go his whole life without becoming a part of the MAL community, and I am truly grateful to this trainwreck of a seriesfor bringing me here. \\n\\n\r\nI started watching Mayoiga on Crunchyroll after watching this week's episode of Evil or Live. I had also finished School Live! the previous week and, not really being in the mood to break away from my seinen spree to start on something like a romance, I picked this series out of 3 or 4 I bookmarked from Crunchyroll's Seinen category. I saw the 3 out of 5 star rating and was quite skeptical (as I've found that, in most cases, Crunchyroll users are pretty reliable on their ratings, especially in regards to its Seinen selection), and I rarely bother with anything with less than four stars. Alas, it seems that fewer and fewer horror series are being released every year, and with some extra time off work, I decided to give this a shot.\\n\\n\r\nI soon came to regret it, thoroughly. I actually started to fall asleep on the first episode, and after seeing the 20th or so character's introduction, I had my doubts over whether or not any particular character would get a thorough backstory, given the series' short length (12 episodes). As a rule of thumb, any notable character should receive at least half an episode dedicated to depth, with main characters deserving a full episode for this, along with gradual development over the series in its entirety. In my eyes, a cast of 30 or so characters sharing 12 episodes meant many characters were gonna get killed off or, in the worst case scenario, a few characters getting mary-sued with the rest pitifully neglected. \\n\\n\r\nI wasn't wrong about this; the main character is the most obnoxious example of a gary-stu I've probably ever seen in an anime, and I've seen many gary-stu's in all mediums of entertainment! He's overwhelmingly kind, dumb as a nail, bland in design and personality, and couldn't work comedy out of a run-of-the-mill ecchi scene if his face actually got buried ribcage-deep in breasts. He gravitates towards an equally stereotypical mary-sue heroine, who, comes complete with the whole blush-cry-and-run eccentricity every time said gary-stu says anything nice to her. I've been sober for 3 months now and just watching any conversation between the two had me thinking about scotch or, at the very least, a flathead screwdriver buried 2 inches deep in my left eye socket. \\n\\n\r\nNone of the characters are actually enjoyable; besides maybe the fat guy, because he fits the fat-guy trope to a capital T. Like one reviewer before me described, all he does the whole series is eat chips, whine, and sleep. Every character fits a common anime trope in some obnoxious fashion. Mayoiga's cast includes the overly-serious glasses-wearing male, the boy-crazy highschool girl, the annoying romantic couple, the quiet borderline-murderous male, the yandere, the middle-aged slutty woman with big boobs, the misunderstood social butterfly, the older male with a dead child and regrets, and- the one I personally despised the most- the moe-fanged action girl with a brainwrenchingly annoying habit of using cat-related puns (i.e., \"Let's wait for meow\"). \\n\\n\r\nThe plot jumps around so fast that you will probably miss something important if you look away for a few seconds to respond to a text. I remember needing to rewind on numerous occasions to catch details which were actually somewhat important to the plot. I tend to take forever watching series because I rewind a lot in order to catch the details, and in most cases I find that I never really miss anything important by doing this. This wasn't the case for Mayoiga; most times I rewinded, I found that I would have, indeed, missed important details if I simply pressed on. Very few series call for this level of attention, and a haphazard series like Mayoiga certainly shouldn't require a laser focus to take in. What's worse, none of the characters were really ever developed. There was an episode right in the middle of the series that crammed several characters' backstories together before abruptly dropping back into the climax of the plot.  \\n\\n\r\nThe series is also complete with numerous utterly pointless scenes confusingly mixed into ones that are actually critical to the plot. You can tell when the animators are trying to fill screentime; it's obvious. There is a scene where my favorite moe action girl after stares at the trunk of a tree and has a mental breakdown as the camera slowly zooms in on its bark, before she goes flying in terror through the woods behind her. It is finally explained after a few scenes that she saw a giant hornet coming out of the tree. I didn't know whether or not to laugh hysterically or facepalm at the sight of this. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're thinking of watching this series for some fanservice, given some of the characters actually being kinda cute (the one thing going for this series is the few non-vanilla characters actually being aesthetically pleasing), you'll be disappointed. For a seinen series there actually isn't much fanservice at all. There's a random instance of this early on where, when the yandere is just as randomly assaulting the protagonist male in the river, you can see her bra through her shirt for a second and literally nothing comes of it. The protagonist blushes and she kinda just rolls off of him; no funny exhange, no awkward scramble, nothing. It was like the animators decided to toss in a tidbit to better match the series up with its rating without really planning it through. \\n\\n\r\nIf you really sit down and focus on the series, you'll get a migraine and probably wind up very confused by the end of most episodes. If you watch it with about 70% attention span, you might be mildly amused by the series chaotically pingpong-balling around as the protagonist finds himself repeatedly torn between being taken advantage of by one of the other characters or being scolded by his best friend who might just be gay for him. Just an hour ago I was watching the central backstory episode, I walked away for 15 or so minutes to clean my cat's litterbox, and I returned to the forest burning down (or something) and the main female telling the main male that he should have more confidence in himself as she prepared to face a giant furby-like monster. Everything is crazy and it all moves so fast. It wasn't until after I finished that episode that I realized the terrors in the woods were probably giant yokai projecting themselves as the subjects of each character's fears, as actually following the series yielded no coherent explanation for what was going on. \\n\\n\r\nWatch this series at you peril if you are seeking a scary seinen series! However, if you watch it with expectations of it being funny due to how bad it is, you'll probably leave the experience satisfied and with a giggle or two. When I let go and started watching the absurdity of everything happening rather than trying to make sense of it, I actually had a pretty good time.",

            "content": "*spoilers ahead*\r\nThis is a bad anime. Plain and simple. And that is somewhat surprising, considering that most of its elements usually would make it good. Take a second to look at the scores i gave to its different elements - decent story and characters, good animation and sound.. So why does it turn out so bad? Pacing, execution and the lack of impact after arising interest.\r\nAfter having everything - as in the budget, characters and the story, i think the error of the creators of this show was to leave it and produce it as is. The anime does a good job at starting, grabbingthe viewers interest, and keeping it up until the very end... And then it suddenly ends. That is not to say that i think that the ending was the best episode in the anime, and that I actually would have given it 5/10 instead of a 6, if not for the ending. Aside of the ending though, the anime didn't deliver that much resolution and impact at any point. There are too many characters, and surprisingly they are almost all pretty well written, but the anime simply had no space for them all to fit in with just 12 episodes, so it kept keeping its sense of mystery while switching from one to the other and explaining all those characters, only to run out of time and give its half baked impact, while leaving a lot of things unresolved and unaddressed.\\n\\n\r\nSo then, what could have made this anime from the half finished, lighthearted product that it is into a proper, and possibly even really good title? A few things, but things that are pretty easy to do so i'm kind of at a loss why they didn't do it. \\n\r\n1- cut out about half of the characters. Now again, i did say that most of them are pretty interesting and well made, but that doesn't change the fact that they simply do not get enough air time at all, to the point where not including the most insignificant of them would actually help resolve more issues and make the show better by focusing more on the rest.\\n\r\n2- lack of action. There is not a lot of it in the show, and a vast majority of action scenes that ARE present is about the main, or less significant characters seeing, and running from their nanaki. I mean that IS kind of an important thing in the show, but to have so many of those scenes is pretty pointless since they are more or less structurally similar and to get the idea that they are supposed to present, just two or three are more than enough, and repeating them so much, especially for characters that later get thrown away until the show ends is simply a waste of time. So what is the solution? Cut about half of them (goes well with point 1)\\n\r\n3- Lack of tension, fear and actual danger. The tension and fear in the show, while present, feel forced, stupid and out of place, as a lot of people pointed out in different discussions about the anime. The reasons for all of those are usually because of lack of trust, coordination, some suspicion and finally the mental problems of some of the characters (a good example would be everyone's \"favorite\" Lovepon). Instead, the show should have actually genuinely killed off a character or two, and that goes back to point 2, as in that it would help add action and it would solve the problem of the current point as well, adding fear and tension that would feel more organic.\\n\\n\r\nSo then, with all of those changes, the anime would probably be structured like this instead - a bit over half for introduction of the new world and characters  as well as the understanding of what's going on, and a bit less than half for the reveal of everything that got shown only at the show's end, and resolving of the problems of all those who wished to leave, along with some aftermath of what happened when they got back, finishing the show with a slight mention of those who stayed behind and how they are coping.\\n\\n\r\nThat's enough dreaming though, the show may have been much, much better if made like that, but since it isn't, i'll give a final verdict on what i think of it as it is- its definitely worth a watch, but getting into it the viewer should have no expectations from it according to its tags, but rather expect an interesting world, set of characters and story.",

Yeah, it's not the most COMPELLING way to do things, but it's not like you'd watch a show that's awful expecting anything good.\r\nOf course, I might sound like I'm turning in circles, but it's hard to put into words the absolutely amazing phenomenon that is Mayoiga. This show isn't just awful, it's awful on purpose and bathes in said awfulness, and the result is nothing short of absolutely hilarious.\r\nYou know all those side-characters in everyanime ever that don't and won't ever amount to something? That's the characters in this show. And they're on a bus. To a village cut out from society. Trust me, it's amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is...well, there is no story.

I ain't against innovation, if you know what I'm saying, and this show sure has some.\\n\\n\r\nYou might respond by saying, \"Well, Sushi, even if the story is complete and utter garbage, but maybe the characters are OK\".

The hippo is apparently very sad. And went to school, got married and was born to fanfare.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then one character asks his best bud how does he know the lyrics, then sings along everyone else for no real reason. Yeah, it's this kind of show.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the madness doesn't stop there; there's a girl who screams bloody murder every time she talks, a pack of rapists including a racist stereotype of a black person and the list goes on.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is standard PA Works material, but character designs are ultimately very forgettable. Animation quality is the weakest from any PA Works show to date, being very random in terms of consistency and having a lot of really ugly looking CGI, as well as the fact that it feels like this show was also shaded in some kind of dark filter everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is completely forgettable, though special credit needs to go to the absolutely amazing (read: hilarious) voice acting, which manages to add a whole new layer to just how utterly stupid the show is. Seriously, these folks were having the time of their lives yelling out and making their lines sound as dumb as possible, it's AMAZING.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short; just watch it. It's so utterly bad it's bloody hilarious, and my god do I hope there's more of this some day.",

The settings fits in with the concept that reminds me of a horror movie. There tends to be a lot of intensity, jump scares and cliff hangers (so you will constantly be up on your feet).\r\nCHARACTERS (5/10): There is a lot of characters who have different personalities and circumstances that they had went through prior to disappearing. (Which in this case, they do explore it during the episodes). For example: There's one who has dealt with an abusive pastwhich causes her to have a mental illness. Plus, There are some who are shy and have a hidden agenda. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL ENJOYMENT (6/10): I'm not a big fan of this anime. Sometimes it's hard to tell which character is which. But their personalities and backstories help me remember some of them. Sometimes, I get upset at the characters because I hate it when some of them had to quickly judge others without proof. Whenever they to reach to end of each episode\u2026 I just want to continue watching it just to see what will they do next during their time in the village.",

In the beginning this show just threw 20 different characters at you and had no idea what it wanted to do. The story was so confusing at first, but made sense at the end of the show. Most of the 20 some characters were mainly just background and had no use other then to just be there. I  think only half of them were actually used in the plot. The rest were just a bunch of characters that were just there to make the show lookfull. As for character development its kinda of hard to tell if there was any. But for at least one or two of the characters there was minimal development. Anyway if you want a quick mystery with some confusing plot that eventually makes sense this is for you.",

Think of all the things they could've done with that in terms of the mystery, horror, and psychological aspect. \r\nArt: 6/10\r\nI'm not going to lie, the art was actually really good, but the reason I have to give it a 6 is because the Nanaki looked like 3D models and I hate when anime do that. Although, I will admit, I did like the designs of the Nanaki because they looked really freaky and scary.\r\nSound: 5/10\r\nThe sound was really lazy. Yes, the opening songwas good, but they only used like 5 soundtracks throughout the entire anime and at least 2 of them sounded like a variation/remix of the same song. \\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nOh God, where do I even begin? The characters basically ruined the series. You would think that out of 30 characters, there would be at least one that I liked, right? Right?? Wrong! There wasn't a single likable character in the entire series! The only person who I kind of liked was Hayato, but only because he was the only person that constantly thought rationally. Then his backstory happened and all my respect for him went out the window. You could immediately tell Mitsumune was the main character just by looking at the cover of the anime. I hated him in the 1st episode! As soon as he made his introduction, my 1st thought was, \"Oh no, you're gonna be the bland main character that nobody likes and is gonna be taken advantage of, aren't you?\" And I was right. Everyone else was so 1 dimensional and retarded. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nIt was a chore to get through this anime. \\n\r\nFinal score: 1/10\\n\r\nThey did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a mystery/horror/psychological anime. The mystery made absolutely no sense. I swear to God, every episode, I was thinking, \"WHAT IS GOING ON?! I JUST WANNA KNOW WHAT THE MYSTERY IS!!\" The horror elements were stupid because although I said the Nanakis looked scary, they were just a figment of people's imaginations, so it's not like they were ever a threat. And the worst thing about this anime is that NOBODY DIED!! There were 30 characters! Did they seriously expect us to remember and like every single character to the point that we would want all of them alive??(By the way, I call bullcrap on the fact that everyone could remember each other's names.) Honestly, I'm more disappointed than angry at this anime. I'm not joking when I said it had a lot of potential. The 1st 2 episodes were really good because they did an excellent job of setting the atmosphere. But that's it. It's a shame because this was an original work, but they're going to have to mark this as a failure. I don't recommend this anime.",

            "content": "With a pretty decent idea in mind, but done in the wrong way, The Lost Village (Mayoiga) was probably the weakest of the Spring 2016 season shows I watched.\r\nI will admit, the first episode got me interested enough to want to see what happened next. But, as the story finally began to unfold, so did my lack of interest. The last few episodes felt like the writers didn't know how to progress the story and decided to wing it. The final episode didn't even feel like it was the end; things happened and it was over. While I don't mind the concept itself, it wasmostly its execution that spoiled it. This is also a story that, I believe, should have gone on for maybe another season.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems would have to be the characters. Right away, we're introduced to all 30 of our characters. That's right, 30. Now, I'm all for an ensemble cast, but I should at least find some of them interesting. I found none of them interesting at all. People's pasts play a crucial part to the story, yet we only get a handful of them while the rest are just there to pad out episodes by going around, letting them have their two cents in the matter, be it important or not. I cannot even care about the ones we get more in depth with because, in the end, they're uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't anything grand, and I'm pretty sure that was the intention. There was moderate consistency with movement and the character models, so there's not really a whole lot to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nI've always been a sucker for any show that has an original concept and not an adaptation of a preexisting source. I don't get a chance to look at the story beforehand; it feels like I'm going in blind, which is a feeling I like. With that notion, I end up giving these type of shows a chance. Of course, like how not all adaptations will be that great, not all original ideas will be great either. The Lost Village is not an exception. Sometimes lack of information can be fun because you don't know what to expect, but can be excruciating when all that hype leads to nothing.",

            "content": "Have you ever watched a show all the way through just to see if it pulls through in the end but it was all just one big joke? This is one of those shows. The story could have been very good. I actually expected it to be 5-8 minute long episodes but to be very interesting. This was not at all the case.\r\nSTORY\r\nThere was a good premise here. They could have done something really interesting. I was half expecting something like Another's story to either be referenced or have a huge influence on this one. I was so very disappointed with how everything was executed.The story starts off nice and easy for the first 1-2 episodes then just jumps into the fire and doesn't stop for a moment. This is why it gets boring. The stories rhythm is completely off. You expect this nice slow horror film to build up with tension and suspense given the feeling of the first two episodes just to have it take you off that haunted house ride and throw you on that rollercoaster down devils ally. After the second episode it felt more like an action scifi story.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nI can't complain because the art is just my type. That's what hurts most about this is that despite being one of my favorite styles the story is so bad I can't stand it.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nI didn't have much of an issue here except on certain parts. When the show starts to take off the sound quality fluctuates depending on the scene which moves quickly and is sometimes hard to follow. I had to go back a couple times just to hear what some people are saying because I didn't want it up to high when the sound got loud.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - The longest One\\n\r\nThis is where the show really takes the cake. I have never seen a more poorly written cast of characters without it having been done on purpose. One of my biggest problems is the survivalist duo. The cat girl and the ranger boy. If they had a single ounce of survivalist in them, they didn't show it once in this show. Ranger boy didn't make it into the military because of his height alone, trust me. From my personal experiences, every time the survivalists cat girl and ranger boy were on the screen I had to stop myself from shouting profanities at my monitor. One of the biggest offences this entire show made was that they were quick to lock up this Jack fellow which he had coming for attempting to assault another person, but let Lovepon, who nearly tortured a young man, the same person who she had blatantly openly admitted to nearly killing earlier, walk around the entire show without repercussion; Yet, the second someone hints that Masaki might be a \"ghost\", everyone loses their shit. Another unforgivable phenomenon is when things started to go bad, everyone and I mean everyone all of a sudden is Sherlock Holmes' long lost cousin. The most hilarious part about that is, I would rate all of them at best a 3 out of 100 in deductive reasoning. Who the hell just starts throwing blame and making up accusations day one of being in an isolated area? LITERALLY ONE PERSON WAS MISSING. He hadn't even been missing for more than an hour and people were flipping out. It felt like a lot of the time I was watching psychotic apes screaming at each other. If they were so worried about one person going missing, no one should have split up and been on their own. They all should have remained in the same building, even the same room that night.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nThe first and second episode are the only episodes I enjoyed from this show. Should have have scrapped every episode after those 2 and redid the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nHonestly, it is the worst show I've ever watched. However, I hate gurren Lagann just a little bit more than this one, but that's for personal reasons. Watch this show if you think it's worth watching over just about any other one out there. Except Gurren Lagann...",

Well following a classic stuck in the middle of nowhere with no way to get home and mysterious monsters plot everyone is always fighting and suspecting other people of being evil. I'm sort of over that whole thing but it was tolerable because I  really wanted to know what was the monster and were they reallyall going to get out of the village. It was really good and kept me on the edge until the last episode. Seriously. The last episode SUCKED. you have been warned.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that was wrong was the ending!!! I get it is hard to end stuff, but seriously!!!! But the rest of it was good. Very light romance which I liked because there was no reason for that to be the main focus. Another thing is that they go into a few of the character's traumas which is very important for the plot but they don't show EVERYONE's. I wanted to know about everyone but they only showed a few. The only way to leave is to accept the emotional scar and they didn't show everyone's emotional scar that they got over. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that really good.",

The questions of why each person was heading towards the village, plus how they grow over time and come to terms with those reasons and the mysteries of the village is a big driving part of this anime and something that I thoroughly enjoyed.\r\nThe biggest problem I found with the anime is the characters, yes I loved most of the main ones, and everyone had their own reasons for coming to the village.  The problemis that many of them didn't seem to develop much beyond that, and it wouldn't be a huge problem normally, you have anime with a lot of side characters and it's no big deal. Here though you have around thirty characters that are supposed to feel part of the story, but for big chunks of time are ignored, or are just there to show whats going on, it just felt a bit odd to me.  \\n\\n\r\nThankfully the ones they do focus on are interesting and I think make for the best parts of the anime, their story is what it focuses upon and gives you a reason to invest in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part I would say is the entire mystery behind the village, what is happening there and so on, it's one your learning about right up till near the end of the series and keeps you guessing about things.  This definitely works for me as you learn at the same time as some of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nI felt that over all you get a satisfying and enjoyable anime, it's not perfect with a few problems, but I definitely enjoyed it over all and recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 7 out of 10",

            "content": "Mayoiga shows a minor problem within the anime community: all of the expectations from previous anime and other mediums of entertainment, in general, have piled up and destroyed the enjoyment of many.\r\nI'm sure many of us were expecting Mayoiga to be similar to a show such as Battle Royale.  It's setting is creepy and mysterious.  A group of people are being sent there to survive.  This sounds like a solid premise for some epic bloody violence, but entertainment has conditioned us to think and expect in that certain manner.  Is that an issue on our part or theirs?  Is ittheir fault for setting up the story in such a way that we tunnel our vision into a certain plot?  Either way, Mayoiga surprised me for how it turned out, especially near its end.\\n\\n\r\nI respect Mayoiga for what it did.  The anime dared to be different and I think it's great that we continue to have risky projects such as Mayoiga.  They tend to be a lot more compelling and intriguing to add to every season, which has given this show plenty of hype coming into the season.  The only problem with this pre-airing hype is its execution and this is where Mayoiga falls off.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Mayoiga is very entertaining, something just feels off.  The characters are sometimes so stupid that it hurts and there are so many WTF moments that are taken the wrong way.  Good shows create moments of \"WOW I didn't expect that!\", while Mayoiga has reactions of \"I don't even know what's happening, this is some acid trip level train wreckage\".  Mayoiga has plot twists that feel so out of place and out of proportion that it just seems really messy and distorted.  They also feel out of place because especially near the end, this anime just lacks an identity.  The viewer anticipates plenty of buildup near its beginning episodes for an epic finale.  However, its last 3-4 episodes take a completely different path to break the cohesion and the flow of its premise and foundation.  This creates the huge trainwreck that Mayoiga becomes.  It was like a high school student taking 5 AP classes and joining 5 sport teams.  With the extensive workload on either side, the schedule is too difficult to balance accordingly.\\n\\n\r\nOn a positive note, Mayoiga's art generally looks kinda good?  The characters are very pretty and stand out easily from the plain backgrounds.  After the characters, everything else looks mediocre.  Some of the enemies look atrocious and out of place because of the contrasting visual style.  This is only an issue near the end, where a certain obstacle appears that is so ugly and gross in the wrong ways.  \\n\\n\r\nSound was alright.  I really like the opening.  It is one of the top 3 this season and brings a lot of hype into the episode.  The ending is decent, but there are better out there.  When it comes to the actual soundtrack, I didn't really notice anything, so I guess the OST is mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were very mixed.  The cast is huge, so at the beginning, the viewer won't know the names of anyone except maybe five characters?  Even near the end, I barely know half of the cast's names.  The half I do notice receive some very interesting backstories.  They were actually very entertaining to my surprise.  Even though the backstories were very compelling, the actual characters were so annoying for a majority of the anime.  I can see why they act in certain ways, but their reasoning does not impact the likability of a character.  The protagonist is a huge wuss.  Some side characters end up being alright, such as Speedstar and Jack.  Overall, the characters are annoying, but decently written.  \\n\\n\r\nMayoiga's main selling point is its enjoyment factor which was pretty high for me.  I did find a few episodes boring, but the abnormal pace didn't stop me from continually watching episodes.  The character interactions are both mindnumbingly stupid and entertaining.  Also, the way the drama unfolds is such a gorgeous trainwreck that you just want to keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, even with all of the problems like the unlikable characters, inconsistent art, and god awful story, I would still recommend Mayoiga.  It's so good at getting out weird reactions at its awfulness and there are even some comedic moments where you may not expect it.  There is also an ending that really sums up this anime very well.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's garbage.",

Honestly i both recommend it and don't Like there were some reallyyy goood moments especially with the driver and each character who had a backstory, the backstories were well done..but it needed more episode to be complete. definitely has nothing to do with another.. of you wanna watch causethe guy is the same that made another welll you're gonna be super disappointed.

I can't even rememberhalf their names. usually I have a favorite character in every show I watch but after having watched 11/12 episodes I can safely say that nobody in mayoiga will make it to that spot. They're all completely unlikeable and two-dimensional. strong characters can carry a weak plot but strong these characters were not.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say anything else about this show is more than mediocre. It's not even 'so-bad-it's-good'; unless you enjoy, in some manner, watching groups of people whose names you can hardly remember arguing with each other for half-hour stretches, this show is honestly a huge waste of time. I only kept watching because I don't like to leave series unfinished - but I really don't feel like coming back for the finale.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I want to start my review by saying that this anime had a lot of potential.\r\nIt had a very interesting psychological concept at its core, but it's biggest mistakes were its lack of character and story development.\r\nI think the biggest problem in terms of character development was that they had too many characters to develop. By the end of the anime, only 3 characters out of the many established went through true character development and growth. Others were somewhat developed as well, but it seemed like it was only done as a way of explanation for another part of the story and was never revisitedagain. \\n\r\nThroughout the anime, you're given very little reason to connect with or care about the characters and whatever trouble they may be going through.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, its development seemed to take a bit of a backseat for a good part of the anime. The anime tried so hard to be mysterious that it dragged on the mystery for too long and was forced to rush to explain everything near the end. This leaves it with a lot of plot holes and senseless resolutions to several plot elements.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Mayoiga is an anime with great potential that was very badly executed.",

I knew I had to write a review so people don't pass on this. \r\n*MINOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD*\r\nOverall the anime doesn't jump out as awesome and I'm sure an anime veteran will be able to identify more things that are wrong. However, while I'm new to anime, I'm still very picky. \r\nThe story is what really elevates this anime. The plot starts of simple, with folks leaving their reallife behind to start over in this off the grid village. What this anime does is, take everything you think is going to happen and turn the other away. I remember mid season I was like, oh I get it. They do this because of that blah blah, but then the anime takes a complete opposite turn. I'm just like whooaaa.. That's what I like about anime, they have a way to M. Night Shyamalan everything. It's what kept me glued whole season. I kept getting it wrong and I wanted to know what happens next. The twists are great and somehow has a way to keep you guessing. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST in the anime is not bad, the main theme that is played often sets the mood of the anime. The voice acting is fine and the art is nice, normal. I dislike over exaggerated art, this is more human like. The character development is a little lacking given it's 12 episodes and it's got like 15 characters or something. There is a plus side which is the lack of filler episodes. I hate fillers and this anime takes a few minutes here and there to explore that which also works as character development. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend it if you're into mystery anime. I don't really see anything wrong with this anime because even with the things I've mentioned that are lacking, it doesn't get in the way or reduce the anime in any way. It flows well and ends perfectly.",

            "content": "I felt obligated to write this review to correct a wrong I\u2019ve seen.  Mayoiga, also known as The Lost Village, drew my attention because it\u2019s a member of an endangered species called horror/thriller anime.  With so few members in the club, you\u2019d think people would use a comb of objective discernment before jumping off the edge of a conclusions mat when examining a new acolyte, but I didn\u2019t find such a review on this site.  I don\u2019t know whether the anime had a School Days Effect because it wasn\u2019t what people expected, but I\u2019m confident if you\u2019re a fan of horror/thriller animewho\u2019s looking for something subverting most of the common, structural tropes of the genre, you won\u2019t be disappointed, even though I\u2019ll admit you\u2019ll wish the project was executed better.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10:  The anime begins with a bus ride of around 30 characters all leaving their disappointing lives to start anew in a hidden village named Nanaki.  They all enter said village, find it abandoned, and then weird stuff starts happening, the people disappearing and bloody claw marks on trees type of weird stuff.  \\n\\n\r\nThis sounds like a genius setup for a horror anime, and I believe the plot presents itself well within the confines of the genre.  It\u2019s the way the plot progresses that bumps it down to a 7.  Usually in a story-driven anime where conversation replaces Michael Bay explosions the general population loves to drool over (The reason why superhero movies, despite using the same, tired formula, are popular yet hidden gems like Box of Goblins and Shin Sekai Yori stay underground), you\u2019d expect most of the conversation to be effective in moving the plot along, but Mayoiga annoyingly has a plot point brought up, then every character giving their two cents, oftentimes a penny, into their thoughts on the situation.  Where in other anime you\u2019d have an intelligent conversation on, \u201cHow the hell do we solve this mess?\u201d here you\u2019ll have two or three characters trying to solve things constantly interrupted by ten or fifteen idiots rambling worse than Shonen side-characters providing combat commentary.  Having the useless third-nipples shut-up, or giving them their own time in mini-arcs would have been a better decision than turning a four man show into fifteen person party.  Nevertheless, The Lost Village stays serviceable by not derailing from the central mystery plaguing the cast, and by keeping its primary cast (You know, those few people moving things along) tied to the mystery.  Speaking of characters:\\n\\n\r\nCharacters  8/10:  Seems like a high score with such a large cast missing in translation, huh?  The show\u2019s characterization is also the primary selling point behind the show being labeled as a comedy (And I think THAT analysis of the show is comedic), but I\u2019d argue the main characters in the story serve their vital functions well, get a decent amount of backstory, and play off each other well, given their past and idiosyncrasies.  Of course you have your tropes (like you\u2019ll find in most anime\u2026), like the overoptimistic protagonist (I congratulated myself on effortlessly winning spot the protag in their 30-person-band), the bantam loli, the normal girl who knows more than she\u2019s letting on (I\u2026 hated her for most of the show), the detective, the take-charge jerk (two of these, actually), the best friend, the modern culture guy, the big-eater, the PDA couple, the crazy one (two of these), the sexy one\u2026 basically the cast of Battle Royale going to a lost village.  Even though most of the cast members are just as useless as sacks of corn as scarecrows, the way the main ones invested in the mystery and interacted added a layer to the ridiculously large cast.  And even though most consider the cast\u2019s antics laughable, I remembered no one on that bus was a normal person.  Everyone was an outcast of society, who felt so ostracized by the lives they led (as their backstories indicate), they felt joining a group of strangers and going to a village in the middle of nowhere the best option to find peace.  Therefore, I expected the weird, sometimes ludicrous actions from the cast, because none of them were well-adjusted individuals.  \\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10:  Nothing I\u2019d put beside Van Gogh, but it served its function well.  The mist added a creepy effect to the town, reminding me of its effect in the Silent Hill series.  I also thought the 3D effects could have been better integrated, but at least it wasn\u2019t as jarring as Ookamikakushi or Berserk\u2019s attempt.  \\n\\n\r\nMusic  6/10:  Nothing I\u2019d put beside Mozart, but the opening\u2019s combination with its music and images made me barely desire to skip it.  The ending theme\u2026  I didn\u2019t care much for.  The somber music that hangs during most of the soundtrack added to the show\u2019s atmosphere, even though there was one time when they tried amplifying a frightening moment with a speedy tempo that fell flat, it overall served its function.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:  No, you\u2019re not going to find a superpowered guy killing people in one punch or growing silver hair and fighting aliens able to destroy planets with a sneeze.  You\u2019re also not going to find a stereotypical gorefest like with Corpse Party or Another.  What we have here is a poor-man\u2019s Shin Sekai Yori or Box of Goblins, but that doesn\u2019t make this a horrible anime (looking at you Ookamikakushi).  This is what Sword Art Online would have become if it was a horror anime, another show that tried to hit the stars but instead\u2026 hits the clouds (With SAO you had too many genres; here you have too many characters).  The biggest victory for The Lost Village, however, isn\u2019t how it almost becomes a deconstruction by trying to subvert some common tropes in horror anime, but in how it proves we shouldn\u2019t judge an anime by what people collectively think about it.  Take a look at it yourselves, and you might find that gem speaking to your unique soul (If you watch the series, you\u2019ll get that pun.) \\n\\n\r\nLook at all these bias scores to a decent anime!  How horrifying!  But I\u2019m going to punch that fear in the face, after it knocked the wind out of me, and give it an:\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  7 out of 10.  \\n\\n\r\nPS:  There is a general theory that this anime is somehow a comedy\u2026  Seriously?  I guess if you find child abuse, adult and school-grade bullying, attempted group lynching, grieving over dead children, and overly strict societal pressures comedic, considering Japan\u2019s high suicide rate among young adults and teenagers, then I GUESS you could find something funny here...  A victim of work-place bullying and abuse myself, though, I found NOTHING comedic about this anime\u2019s overall plot.  Yes, it had funny moments to lighten tension, but that\u2019s it.  A few of the character\u2019s plights even touched a personal note with me.  If the writer/manga writer comes out and says, \u201cYes, I meant this to actually be a comedy!\u201d  I guess I\u2019ll have to eat a sheet of paper with my words on it, but until that day nothing I saw convinced me this is a comedy anime masquerading as a horror/thriller.      \\n",

As it progressed I found myself always wanting to watch the next episode. That was until the last couple of episodes. Character development takes a dive and the last few episodes just seem extremely rushed. Although much is explained that more or less makes sense, it just doesn't do a good job at wrapping it up. All in all, the characters start out strong, the story is intriguing, and the concept was pretty fresh. Making it all cometogether in a satisfying way is where this one fails.",
