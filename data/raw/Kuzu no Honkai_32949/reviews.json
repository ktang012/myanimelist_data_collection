            "content": "There aren't many anime as uncomfortable as Kuzu no Honkai. It introduces itself as a melancholic tale of unrequited love, and quickly transforms into something far more ugly. The characters are relentlessly trampled upon, until, indeed, as the title might suggest, they are reduced to human trash. \r\nIt isn't necessary for a story to make you feel happy. There exist a wealth of fiction that, while depressing, and perhaps never even enjoyable, are still valuable for the message they are trying to make. \r\nKuzu no Honkai doesn't have that message. It is misery for misery's sake, existing almost exclusively to make you feel like crap.If you found anime such as Aku no Hana and School Days difficult to watch, you might have yourself something of a challenge here, too. \\n\\n\r\nThere is seldom a character within Kuzu no Honkai who behaves sensibly or is capable of thinking with any other organ except their genitalia. Hanabi and Mugi are lonely because they cannot be united with their loved ones, and so they seek to find some solace in each other. They can't love each other because they love someone else. They use sexual intimacy as an escape. But they still can't give up on the one they love. And so the cycle, their tedious lives continue.\\n\\n\r\nIf that is where the series stood, all may have been fine. But it escalates, and they, and just about everyone else surrounding them, wants more, more, until nothing remains in their hollow lives but sex and sleaze. It becomes impossible to feel any empathy for them and the grief they are constantly plunging themselves into. They're beyond saving. They deserve everything that happens to them. And so I cannot bring myself to care when it tries to play Hanabi as the victim, the tragic heroine. The real victims are Norumi (the male teacher) and Noriko for being deceived by such deplorable people. Love is blind, as the cheesy proverb goes, but in this case they must also be blind in the literal sense. \\n\\n\r\nMost of Kuzu no Honkai's cast is comprised of hypocrites who get upset with their partner(s) for acts they have been committing themselves. They act nonsensically at times, and can change their attitude on a whim, giving up on their love at the end of one episode and then cheerfully encouraging each other to confess at the beginning of the next. They haven't the slightest idea of what they want. Maybe that is to be expected. Love is a tricky thing, after all, and teenagers are at their most confused stage in life. But it becomes a question if what they felt was ever love in the first place when they can so readily find someone else as a replacement, sleeping with anyone who shows them even the slightest affection. It's entirely possible that Hanabi and Mugi only fell in love with their respective partner because they were the first ones to give them that affection. And so how am I to feel bad for the two when their crushes end in disappointment? \\n\\n\r\nWhile women like Akane undoubtedly exist in the real world (having unfortunately encountered someone similar myself), she is possessed by such an intensely twisted and ugly worldview that it becomes a wonder how she is even able to fulfil her duties as a teacher. She eventually comes to a point of redemption, but makes it quite clear that she is there only to see, to try, potentially ruining a man's entire life merely for the chance of relieving her boredom. I didn't find that heartwarming as it was intended to be - I found it disgusting of her, and that's in the face of all the detestable things she had already done. \\n\\n\r\nThe main theme of each episode is who is going to make out with or bang whom. It's an endless rotation, much like a hentai, the characters seemingly unaware of or passive to the concept of cheating, and incapable of guilt. Everyone loves someone else, and seemingly nobody in the world is capable of a happy, fulfilling relationship-- even Hanabi's friends (who are never otherwise shown) are revealed as having their partner cheating on them. Maybe it's a good thing I detest all the characters, as I don't think I would want a character I actually like to be in a story like this. Any time Noriko appeared, the one I disliked the least, I was dreading to see the mess she might be dragged into. And Narumi, while naive to painful extents, is never really deserving of the awful situation Akane puts him through. The only joy you could possibly extract from something like this is some sadomasochistic desire to see everyone in pain and despair. I can't say I possess that desire.\\n\\n\r\nThe main rebuttal, I would imagine, is that the characters are meant to be human trash, and so it is okay that they are trash. I could concede to that point, as stories do not require respectable characters. But even trash are human, and so it is expected that they still behave like humans, a detail that Kuzu no Honkai seems so ready to forget. \\n\\n\r\nSanae, for instance, has such an intense (and frankly creepy) attachment to her loved one that it almost seems a crime for her to not be locked away in some mental hospital. There can at times be a desire to stay with someone you love even when you know you cannot have them or that they are bad for you, but she long crosses the boundary of how real people would react in her situation. There is a difference between being a confused teenager who seeks sexual gratification, and being a psychotic almost-rapist who believes people are their property. If they have done as she does, then they've probably gotten to know prison life pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nIt's also questionable why the author decided to complicate things further by giving Sanae someone who one-sidedly loves her as well, considering how little is ever done with them. You could write them out completely and it wouldn't affect much of anything. They exist solely, I would assume, to create more despair, as if the show hadn't enough of that already. \\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai's detestable cast is, if nothing else, well-realised, thanks to the frequent monologuing and backstories. Each of the main six get their turn to narrate on numerous occasions, which does well to explain their motivations and feelings and to make them feel like proper protagonists rather than mere accessories to the carnage, even if some (namely Sanae) receive significantly less characterisation than others. To merely show two characters having sex or making out with each other is not nearly as meaningful as when it is accompanied by narration. It leaves less to the imagination, but, unlike other intensely uncomfortable and cringe-filled anime such as School Days, gives substance to the scene and makes sense in the context of the characters. When timed with the anime's emotional soundtrack, some of the dialogue can almost feel captivating, and a kiss can carry power, even if it is between two people who really have no business kissing each other in the first place. It's nice to have an anime courageous enough to portray sex in an honest manner, as most use it purely for pornographic purposes, or seem afraid of touching upon it altogether, as if humans are somehow sexless creatures. I just don't think that real people are nearly as defined by it as they are in Kuzu no Honkai. \\n\\n\r\nI'll fully admit that I hated every second I spent watching Kuzu no Honkai, and felt relieved when it was over. This isn't because it is a particularly bad anime, but because it aims to say or do little else but make the viewer feel terrible. It pushes you, kicks you, and then throws another punch to your gut once that is over. It is filled with moments where you want to shout at the characters to stop, to not be stupid. There are times where you will have to pause and take a breather because of all the cringe and madness that is unfolding. Kuzu no Honkai is about as far from a pleasant anime as can possibly be, and it never really aims to fill that gap with much substance or meaning. Its starting and ending points are the same. It wants to say that people are stupid, that love hurts, and more than that, it wants you to hurt, too. \\n\\n\r\nSome people will be fine with that. Maybe they want to feel awful. Maybe they just want to feel emotion, any emotion.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give them that - it certainly makes you feel something.",

            "content": "Have you ever desired something that's not politically correct? Kuzu no Honkai is an anime about desire. The main characters want something that they cant have Hanabi Yasuraoka loves Narumi Kanai her teacher and \"brother\". Mugi Awaya loves his teacher Akane Minagawa. Unfortunately for Hanabi and Mugi their love is not reciprocal. \r\nForgive me for any grammar errors, i'm not used to write in english\r\nStory: 10\r\nThis is not an usual romance anime. This anime is very original, and in a certain way, unique. There are unforeseeable events and the story grows perfectly.\r\nArt: 10\r\nPerfect, detailed, stunning.\r\nSound: 10\r\nThe opening \"Uso no Hibana\" is a masterpiece, and theending \"Heikousen\" even better. Extremely competent voice actors and an above avarage sound-track.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nDeep characters at all, even with only 4 episodes until now (02/02/2017) is possible map their personalities and understand why they do what they do. The only thing that is bothering me is Akane, i cant understand her personalitie at all. However 4 episodes isn't a lot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI'm really enjoying this anime, as you probably noticed in the course of this review english is not my main language. Even so i'm watching this anime with english subtitles so i can watch this earlier (it takes time to translate into portuguese). This anime is very fun to watch, so absolutely recommend it if you enjoy a deeper and darker romance. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nIt really touched me in a personal level and caught my attention, characters look like real persons, original story and pretty enjoyable at all.\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\nEDIT 17/02/17 (Episode 6)\\n\r\n Pretty minor spoilers here\\n\\n\r\nArt: Same\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n Well, as i said before this is an unique anime romance story, if you have seen any romance anime with a similar story just let me know, because until now i know none. Two weeks ago i said that this story is full of unforseeable events, i was not wrong. I have seen much anime, maybe not as much as 50% of you but thruth be told 50 days IS a lot (and i cant remember the name of every single anime i saw), stay, i never saw anything like this in ANIME, you can find similar manga and pretty similar american TV series but there's not a single anime with this premisse, and if there is as i said before, just let me know, like, please.\\n\r\n Ok the story is original, but is it good? It is a well-developed story, you \\n\r\nprobably already had that feeling when the story is going to absolutely nowhere, you wont have that feeling watching this. And please, do not say that there is fanservice, if you see Kuzu No Honkai sex scenes as fanserive you are probably a sadistic. Sex in Kuzu no Honkai is DRAMA. Am i going to get horny? Yes you'll, but you wont feel good for this. Sounds strange? Yea that is why this is Story is fabolous IF you are mature enought to understand what is going on so i still with my 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Same\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8.75\\n\r\nI said before that Akane was bothering me, not anymore. She got humanized.\\n\r\nSome people might disagree me, and i cant explain why because it'd be spoiler so i'll explain why i do think she got \"humanized\". She got drunk and said shit. That's pretty normal for and adult, she is not an agel or a demon she is a person like you and me. \\n\r\nAnd we still have pretty complex characters like Mugi, Hanabi and Sanae. \\n\r\nWhy i cant give this a 10? \\n\r\nWell basically 2 reasons\\n\r\n1 I've seen better.\\n\r\n2 A character like Moca have only one purpose, to suffer. She worked hard her whole life in order to Mugi notice her, and what she gets? Nothing, well nothing actually would be better, she gets suffering. As i said before there's a uforeseeable story but still i cant imagine Moca being happy.\\n\\n\\n\r\n,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "My Opinion: \r\nDid \u201cSchool Days\u201d get a second season? Oh, no, it\u2019s Kuzu no Honkai, also known as one of the most popular and overrated anime series of winter 2017.\r\nKuzu no Honkai is an exaggeration of the love life experienced by high school students and watching it reminded me of a National Geographic documentary about mating rabbits I saw years ago.\r\nWhile the show had some very good ideas, it failed in executing them, fact which made the show look more like a trainwreck rather than the \u201cin-depth, mature\u201d series it intended to be. \r\nThe plot is inconsistent and poorly executed for the most part employingcliche ideas, cringe worthy scenes, predictable twists and unnatural actions. \\n\r\nThe character cast in itself is poorly constructed and consists mostly of generic tropes that are shallow and one-dimensional, but the inter-relations between them were surprisingly well-done.\\n\r\nNowadays, shows that feature adolescents thinking about and doing the dirty is considered to be mature and \u201cin-depth\u201d... To be honest, Kuzu no Honkay is your generic drama TV series that got animated, nothing more and nothing special.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nThe story revolves around the love life of two high school students, Hanabi Yasuraoka and Mugi Awaya.\\n\r\nHigh school students Mugi Awaya and Hanabi Yasuraoka appear to be the ideal couple, they are both pretty and popular, and they seem to suit each other well. However, outsiders don't know of the secret they share, both Mugi and Hanabi have hopeless crushes on someone else and they are only dating each other to soothe their loneliness. \\n\r\nHanabi has been in love for a long time with her older childhood friend Narumi Kanaiwho who is now her homeroom teacher, and Mugi is in love with his slightly older former tutor Akane Minagawa who is now a music teacher at his school.\\n\r\nIn each other, they find a place where they can grieve for the ones they cannot have and they share physical and emotional intimacy driven by loneliness. This begins their romantic relationship as both of them predictably fall for each other as the story unfolds.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is character-driven, linear and fairly unique but predictable, it progresses with the characters at a good pace, showing their inner thoughts and development as well as portraying their dilemmas and questions about love.\\n\r\nThemes such as \u201cforbidden love\u201d, \u201cfriendship\u201d, \u201cmaturity\u201d, \u201csex, lies and betrayal\u201d are approached by this show and some of them are fairly well executed while some of them are not. \\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai explores sexuality from the interesting yet juvenile perspective of high school students. Unfortunately, what could have been a great enlightening experience turned into a revolting experience consisting of watching people as they take some really dumb and weird sexual actions with no clear purpose other than satisfying their primitive needs.\\n\r\nThis anime touches the sensitive feelings and problems that most young people go through when they find real love/romance or fake love/romance that they don\u2019t know how to deal with and the problems those feelings can lead to. While I commend the show for taking such an unusual path I cannot ignore the poor manner in which it was executed.\\n\r\nI wish the show would have focused much more on the moral and emotional implications of these love acts, showing and thoroughly analyzing the psych of the characters rather than focusing on poor-taste sex scenes that seemed forced, but that\u2019s just my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai is the definition of a pretentious show because the main theme is \u201cI\u2019m 17 and I\u2019m deep\u201d and the show expects to be treated as a mature and profound romance series.\\n\r\nAlthough Kuzu no Honkai has those ambitions, it miserably fails at being mature and rather comes off as pseudo-mature. A bunch of junior high school students try to compensate for their desires, insecurities and unrequited sentiments through ludicrous acts like pointlessly having sex in order to \u201cfill their emptiness\u201d. Is that the best they could come up with? \\n\r\nAlso, recall the villainous slutty music teacher who screws around saying she \u201cexploits\u201d men, that is so profound.... I failed to see the \u201cmaturity\u201d and \u201cprofoundness\u201d of this show.\\n\\n\r\nScum\u2019s Wish tried so hard to be complex to the point the script became an utter mess.\\n\r\nWhy I say that?\\n\r\nHanabi loves Kanai, Mugi loves Akane but Hanabi and Mugi are together, and Akane and Kanai are together, Moca loves Mugi and Ecchan loves Hanabi and now Hanabi starts to fall for Mugi. \\n\r\nI say it is too complex for its own good, it seems like a clusterfuck of a situation more than anything else and to be honest, it\u2019s dumb and pathetic to see a show try so hard and fail just as hard.\\n\\n\r\nThe \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d scenario is as cliche as it can get and makes the plot so much more predictable. This scenario consists of the generic course of action where two people decide to have sex on a regular basis and promise to never fall in love with each other and later on they always end up falling in love with each other. \\n\r\nAs predicted, after Hanabi and Mugi started having sex they started developing feelings for each other and later on in the show, Hanabi decides to \u201ctry to love Mugi\u201d, predictable.\\n\r\nI guess the creator watched one of those cliche movies like \u201cFriends With Benefits\u201d or \u201cNo Strings Attached\u201d and decided to do a perverted and twisted animated version of them.\\n\\n\r\nIn a sense, Kuzu no Honkai is a jumble of realistic scenarios and life problems which I really enjoyed. It portrays questions and situations some people  faced in their youth and could relate to, such as:\\n\r\n\u201cIf I could have things work out with him\u2026 I\u2019d do it in a heartbeat\u201d - which is very much true, the only thing you want when you are in love is to be with the one you love but sometimes you don\u2019t have the \u201ccourage\u201d to take the first step towards that goal and that is unfortunate.\\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I should choose the older man or the athletic student\u201d - also a problem that a lot of women face when they have the option of choosing between money and social security represented by the \u201dolder man\u201d or looks represented by the \u201cathletic student\u201d, in the end, neither choice is based on the feeling of \u201clove\u201d but it is rather based on the feeling of lust or the need to feel secure. \\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what is the diffrence between love and lust anymore\u201d - a question that confuses many teenagers but has a rather simple answer.\\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I like them both so much it hurts but making the choice is a pain\u201d - also a real problem many people face before entering a relationship just for the sake of doing it because they had nothing better in mind. \\n\r\n\u201cIt was love at first sight\u201d - as the line says, this \u201clove\u201d can only be based on physical appearances therefore it is superficial and should be called lust.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like is that Kuzu no Honkai is an open-minded show in which love has no bounds. Be it student-teacher, lesbianism, incest or childhood friends, nothing will stop the characters from having sexual intercourse based on a moment\u2019s decision.\\n\r\nThe idea of exploring same-gender love was actually great, after all, that is what Kuzu no Honkai is supposed to do, but the execution of it was terrible and resulted in a girl-to-girl scenario that was wrong, out of place and furthermore damaged the show.\\n\r\nAfter seeing Hanabi willingly have \u201csex\u201d with a female friend after being rejected, I was left pondering that course of action and questioned the creator\u2019s knowledge of the female mind, therefore I proceeded in asking multiple young female friends if they would have sex with a person of the same gender, given the context of being \u201cheartbroken\u201d. The answer was an unanimous \u201cno\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters seem damaged on a fundamental level, desperately wanting the attention of their loved ones, fact which I could not understand.\\n\r\nHanabi is obsessed over her \u201conii-chan\u201d to the point that what she feels is not called \u201clove\u201d but \u201clust\u201d. It is not normal to fantasize about your crush to the point where you have sex with another person while pretending that person is your crush. \\n\\n\r\nI find this \u201cunrequited\u201d love situation grossly exaggerated and forced because it doesn\u2019t follow a natural flow and it is very far from being realistic. \\n\r\nFor the sake of the plot, these characters have no common sense, instead of confessing their \u201clove\u201d or silently await the right moment to take the initiative, they decide to screw around and play house with no worries about the consequences of their actions or their future.\\n\r\nWhen I was in highschool my first and foremost priority was studying in order to pass the university entrance exam, not fooling around and whining about being lonely. \\n\r\nI know I shouldn\u2019t compare anime to real life, but they made the show in a high school setting because they wanted people to relate to it and how am I supposed to relate to such exaggerated, unnatural and hard to believe love problems?\\n\\n\r\nAnother important writing screw-up made by the creator was changing the fundamental traits of the characters in very short periods of time, referring to Noriko and Akane.\\n\r\nNoriko is an innocent girl who has built her life around the idea that she is a princess and only thinks about marrying her \u201cprince\u201d and live happily ever after, an innocent girl who suddenly wants to have sex with the prince, basically a \u201cprincess\u201d turned into a lusty and deplorable girl in the matter of a few minutes\u2026\\n\r\nAkane, a despicable women who screws around seeking any man\u2019s attention and other women\u2019s jealousy. This woman that is damaged on a fundamental level suddenly changes as Narumi, the \u201cknight in shining armor\u201d touches her soul. It is not only cliche but also unreal, for a woman who only considers men as warm bodies, distractions from a mundane life and basically sleeps with anyone she meets to be changed so easily. Poor judgement on the writer\u2019s part. \\n\r\nThere was a saying, \u201cyou can\u2019t change a whore into a housewife\u201d and that perfectly applies to Akane\u2019s situation. From all the lack of judgement on the creator\u2019s part I was able to notice a life lesson: If you are pretty, everything is forgiven. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing that bothered me were the imbecilic lines such as: \u201cI want you to be filled with me\u201d; \u201cGetting a man to fall for you is easy\u201d, \u201cIt doesn't matter if we are cousins, I\u2019ll never give up\u201d; \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stop seeing other men\u201d, etc. and the forced, cringe-worthy scenes when Hanabi was giving a handjob to Mugi, a bunch of idiotic scenes about Akane, etc. \\n\r\nAt least I sometimes laughed at how stupid some of the lines and scenes were...\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThe characters on their own are nothing special, they are mostly self-centered tropes and quite despicable characters that are difficult to relate to or like, but when they are looked at as a whole, it\u2019s a different situation. Almost forgot, there is no character development except for Hanabi and Akane.\\n\r\nWhat I found interesting is the true strength of Kuzu no Honkai that lies in the character interactions, this show has some amazing relationship development.\\n\\n\r\nHanabi Yasuraoka, she is a high school student who is in love with her older childhood friend, Narumi who is her homeroom teacher. After finding out that Narumi is in love with another woman, Hanabi enters a \u201cfake\u201d relationship with Mugi to satisfy her loneliness but soon after she has physical relations with Mugi, she realizes her feelings towards him, and as the story unfolds her character undergoes multiple changes.\\n\r\nAt first, Hanabi is portrayed as a innocent girl but after she begins her relationship with Mugi she becomes confused and doesn\u2019t know what she is feeling and what she is supposed to feel, as she states, \u201cI can\u2019t even tell the difference between love and lust anymore\u201d. \\n\r\nAfter finding out that Narumi had sex with Akane, Hanabi decides to \u201csteal\u201d everyone that is under Akane\u2019s \u201cspell\u201d by having sex with them. Fortunately enough, after dating one of Akane\u2019s boytoys, Hanabi realizes that lowering herself to Akane\u2019s level is not the answer to her predicament and hateful emotions, therefore she stops deluding herself by thinking she can beat Akane at her own game. Soon after that, Hanabi begins to isolate herself from Mugi and starts thinking of herself as a \u201cweak\u201d person and a \u201ccoward\u201d, having no \u201cself-worth\u201d, this is a difficult time for Hanabi because she feels defeated and inferior to Akane. \\n\r\nAs the story progresses, Hanabi slowly recovers from that depressive state of mind and fulfilling a promise she made to Mugi, Hanabi confesses her love to Narumi and gets rejected, event that sets Hanabi free and makes her feel like she can have a fresh start at life.\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Hanabi goes from being a normal girl to lowering herself near to the level of a \u201cslut\u201d but she soon recovers from that downfall and starts to feel miserable about herself only to later regain a healthy way of thinking and decide to stop ignoring her feelings towards Mugi.\\n\r\nMy thoughts on her character: Hanabi just wants true love but doesn\u2019t know how to lover herself, yet.\\n\\n\r\nMugi Awaya, he is a high school student who is in love with his former tutor, Akane. He and Hanabi begin a fake \u201crelationship\u201d to satisfy each other's desires. In middle school, Mugi had already been in a \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d relationship with his senior, Mei Hayakawa, who took his virginity.\\n\r\nMugi is not a dense man but rather clever and observant, he is one of the only men who realized what type of woman Akane really was, he had always been aware of the kind of person Akane was, but loved her nevertheless. \\n\r\nMugi is reluctant to admit his true emotions towards Hanabi because he already had that kind of \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d relation, he fell in love with that person and ended up heartbroken because the relationship had to end. He is still afraid of being close to someone, point that is proved in the scenes where he asked for sexual favors then suddenly stopped as if it was a bad idea, which is synonymous with him wanting to try being in a relationship again but being scared of the rejection he once experienced.\\n\r\nAt the end of the series, after he had sex with Akane on multiple occasions, trying to change the way she was, he realizes he doesn\u2019t love Akane anymore so he bids goodbye to her.\\n\\n\r\nNarumi Kanai is Hanabi\u2019s homeroom teacher and older childhood friend.\\n\r\nNarumi is the generic and cliche type of man who is kind, shy, mellow, forgiving, etc. \\n\r\nHe is in a relationship with Akane even though he knows she is a \u201cslut\u201d and completely forgives her for it, telling her she \u201cdoesn\u2019t need to stop seeing other men\u201d because he loves her enough to accept that part of her.\\n\r\nEven after knowing Akane's true nature, Narumi does not seem to mind and asks her to marry him, which she accepts. Bleh, cliche.\\n\r\nMy opinion on his character: He is just an emasculated guy who plays the role of the knight in shining armor that saves Akane from herself. More and  I\u2019m gonna throw up.\\n\\n\r\nAkane Minagawa, on the outside, she is a nice, well-behaved woman who is adored by her students, but she actually loves the feeling of winning a man's heart while directly hurting someone else who is in love with that man. She can also be considered a lonely person and a nymphomaniac. \\n\r\nAkane attempts to seduce Narumi like her previous relationships, but she notices that Narumi refrains from touching her, unlike the men in her past, later realizing that he truly loves her. After Narumi asks her to marry him despite of knowing her true nature, Akane begins to take interest in him and suddenly decides to change her ways. Bleh, cliche.\\n\r\nMy opinion on her character: This depraved woman thinks she is \u201cexploiting\u201d men when she has sex with them but actually she is the one being used and \u201cexploited\u201d, what a pathetic and disgusting state she is in.\\n\r\nI have a saying that fits this like a glove: \u201cA key that can open many locks is called a master key, but a lock that can be opened by many keys is a shitty lock.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters that are just empty tropes, particularly Sanae Ebato who is the lesbian girl who forced herself on Hanabi, and Noriko Kamomebata who is a deluded \u201cloli\u201d girl that considers herself a princess and dreams of marrying her \u201cprince\u201d, Mugi. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the strong point of Kuzu no Honkai are the character interactions, which I\u2019ve basically described in the paragraphs above, no need in doing it again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful with surprisingly good character designs, working with a well-chosen color palette that gives a somber tone. The animation is fluid, nothing to complain about other than a few small flaws and the overuse of \u201chidden eyes\u201d, which are used when they want the characters to reflect a deep emotion.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme were well-suited for the show, not only being pleasant to hear but also having some symbolism and offering a drama tone. The OST was well-chosen as well, it offers an immersive experience and facilitates the potential flow of emotions coming from the show. The voice actors did a very good job interpreting the characters and their emotions but there were some exceptions to the rule.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI am inclined to say that I enjoyed the show despite its numerous flaws.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nThe show has failed in many categories but I think it does a fairly good job at showing how cruel love can be. If you are looking for a romance show that is slightly different form the generic \u201cboy meets girl\u201d scenario, give Kuzu no Honkai a shot.",

            "content": "When someone considers themselves or others to be connoisseurs of any storytelling media, there are specific prerequisites expected from that individual that's usually understood without the need to outright state it. These factors can include being well-versed with different genres within the medium in question, to more demanding things, like understanding the construct in which the medium expresses its ideas. But out of all these unspoken base requirements, I think the most important one is something that's usually acknowledged but often taken for granted. That something in question is a hands-on understanding of the subject matter itself. \r\nWithout that attribute, an exhausted catalog ofliterary knowledge and understanding of narrative tools is rendered almost pointless. Being book smart amounts to nothing without practical experience, or at the very least, first-hand encounters. Think of it this way, knowing about an archetype or trope is only as valuable as understanding what worldly influence caused it to exist, to begin with. Anyone can comprehend a creator's intent all day, but without an inkling of relation to it, all diegetic information could only be taken for what it is at face value. \\n\\n\r\nNow, with that in mind, it's time to take a quick litmus test; ladies and gentlemen, Kuzu no Honkai (Scum's Wish) is average.\\n\\n\r\nQuickly, what was your initial thought after reading that statement? Did you think that was an outlandish claim to make? That Scum's Wish is far from average and that the claim made was purposefully contrarian or, for the lack of a better word, attention-seeking? How can an anime that explore sexual decadents with such unfiltered restraint be considered \"average\" by any means? Most relationship anime don't even get past first base, so how can that claim be justified? \\n\\n\r\nIf you've already come to a similar conclusion regarding Scum's Wish before reading my statement, bear with me, as for everyone else that possibly rattled off something similar to the aforementioned thought process, time to explain why. \\n\\n\r\nOne Tree Hill, Gossip Girl, The O.C, Dawson's Creek, 90210, Pretty Little Liars, Gilmore Girls; what do these live-action TV shows have in common? Well, for one, they're centered around teens or young adults dealing with relationship drama in very exaggerated ways. And secondly, and perhaps more important as well, they're usually understood by most astute viewers to be conventional television programming. No critical thinker or demanding viewer worth their salt is singing high praises about these shows. The reason why is pretty simple, apart from being well-cultured in several different mediums that is. The discernment for shows of this ilk ties back to that essential requirement I mentioned: having hands-on experience. \\n\\n\r\nIf your firsthand encounter with the drama Scum's Wish wraps itself up in is close to none, praising it becomes easy to do. However, if you've ever been involved in any relationship, where you and the party in question were mutually in it for sexual gratification, then what Scum's Wish tries to depict gradually gets more juvenile and diluted with each passing episode. Anyone of the bottled off sexual/sensual encounters it indulges in can be believable on its own, but when meshed together to the degree in which every single character in immediate circles in the show is involved in a daisy chain of intimate depravity\u2014at that point, it becomes wholly unrealistic; almost approaching the point of midday soap opera levels of contrived. This is sensationalized TV drama 101; the quintessential reason for why the phrase \"sex sells\" remain relevant for mainstay media.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, Scum's Wish is an animated version of your typical live-action teen/young adult drama TV show.    \\n\\n\r\nNow, before we go on any further, let's make this clear, teen/young adult drama shows themselves aren't inherently devoid of substance. There are live-action TV shows like Friday Night Lights and My So-Called Life, and even animated titles such as Nana and Beck that receive widespread critical acclaim for the same kind of things depicted in Scum's Wish. But instead of sensationalizing the subject matter for the sake of capturing audience attention, those shows decide to represent the relationships of the characters in naturalistic ways. The key takeaway here is that those shows did NOT rely on sensationalizing its content. That's the difference between media that use sex in an exploitative manner, and those that incorporate it as just another facet of life in the narrative at hand. Having relatable scenarios don't amount to much if it's unrealistically presented in the confines of the story. The show takes itself seriously, but the situations themselves are vapid at best. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that isn't even to say that theatrically sensationalized programming doesn't have its place in storytelling media either.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no shortage of TV shows that use sensationalism to its advantage; such is the case with TV series like Shameless. A show that purposefully acknowledges the fact that it's all about sex, violence, drugs, and mayhem. And if the namesake didn't already make that clear enough, it \"shamelessly\" uses these aspects to tell its story. But that's the difference between something that's purposely sleazy like Shameless and the likes of Scum's Wish. One show is self-aware of its overblown content while the other operates with an aura of conceit and pretension.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough with the long-winded preamble, let's discuss what the show is all about. Short answer: yearning for others and sexual depravity. Long answer:\\n\\n\r\nFor as long as she could remember, Hanabi \"Hana\" Ysuraoka has been infatuated with her neighbor, Narumi Kanai. Due to their single parent upbringing, from a young age, they had quickly established a sort of family bond with each other, with Narumi becoming a frequent guest in Hanabi's household, to the point where she refers to him as her \"big brother.\" Eventually, this infatuation Hanabi shares for Narumi slowly turn into a romantic interest. And as is the case with any story scenario of this nature, that love goes unnoticed as Narumi has his eyes set on someone else. That someone being the alluring music teacher and predestined rival, Akane Minagawa. \\n\r\nBeing the object of affection to any guy that attends Hanabi's high school, Akane has no shortage of men fawning over her at any given time. With her strawberry blonde hair, alluring smile, and an aura that just permeates femininity, Narumi became yet another lovestruck male caught up in her presence. \\n\\n\r\nWith Akane and Narumi both being teachers, Hanabi's standing as a student further widens the gap between her and the one she loves, as she watches with each interaction they share slowly chipping away at her chances of ever having him to herself. Left in a state of emotional limbo, unable to do anything but watch as he gradually slips further out of reach; it's here, in this place of solitude that she finds out that she's not alone. A pair of eyes fixated with a familiar saddened gaze reflected in them stare at the cheerful adults as well. His name, Mugi Awaya. She may not know him personally, but that familiar bitter tinge of unrequited love that they mutually share leaves her a small glimmer of reassurance\u2014\"I don't have to suffer this alone.\" And so a pact is made by the pair, one signed with only physical comfort in mind. Sexual relief, mutual resentment, a promise of no strings attached; emotions left harbored off from each other for that promised day. Friends with benefits with only one intent in mind, to eventually gain the affection of the person they truly yearn for. \\n\\n\r\nA tragic, bittersweet, ill-fated romance. A setup that could take on so many avenues of exploration and be successful at all of them if done right. It doesn't have to do much, just simply show the consequence of that kind of entangled emotional dependence as it affects the characters involved. Anything that toxic and shortsighted is bound to cause psychological scarring to anyone that participates. A dangerous game that some of us may have personally felt the backlash for at some point in our lives, after foolishly thinking that we were above the consequences. That somehow the end-result that many faced before wouldn't apply to us. A foolhardy belief that we could handle it where others weren't capable. \\n\r\nA continuous physical/sexual dependence on others will always come with a steep price of admission, whether it's immediately realized or comes on later in life during a silent night laying in bed, as thoughts of it creep in, festering in your idle mind. The foolishness of our now bruised ego, as we reflect on the stupid decisions of our past selves. Hubris in its purest form, with humility being the bitter pill we're made to swallow.   \\n\\n\r\nAnd to the show's credit, it does a good enough job depicting that inevitability. The problem is that it doesn't just stop there, as it decides to go the whole nine yards, and then some. Instead of just settling with a believable depiction to carry this core message, Scum's Wish is too greedy to call it quits. It doesn't just want to depict that scenario; it wants to portray everything under the sun, exhausting every possible love/lust situation imaginable in an attempt to make every possible outcome into an attention-seeking circus act of sexual decadents. And it's because of this, what once started out as a reasonably believable scenario, has now been turned into a ludicrously overblown orgy fest.\\n\\n\r\nWithout getting into specific names or details, I'm going to describe the general plotting of this show. And no, I'm not exaggerating here, this is what truly happens:\\n\\n\r\nPerson A wants to be with person B, but person B wants to be with person C, and person C only desire attention, and person D wants to be with person C but settled for person A, while person E wants to be with person D, and person F wants to be with person A, and person G wants to be with person F, and person H wants to be with anyone who's willing, and person C uses person H, while person D uses person E, while person J and D use each other, and person A uses person F, and person H tries to use person A... and so on and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nAnd again, this isn't an exaggeration, this is what actually happens when you sit down to map out the plot for each episode. To say this story is insanely contrived would be an understatement. There are shows with fatalism in it that manage to feel less artificial. Any character that's recurring or has a name in this story is actively trying to bone each other.\\n\\n\r\nThere is absolutely nothing realistic about this toxic nonagonal love-web. And it's this web that actively defeats any victory laps the show achieves with any one of the individual stories stuck inside it. This show does have genuine character beats and arcs, but when all that's mired in content that's essentially one big exploitative fuck-fest, it's hard to take any of it seriously. \\n\\n\r\nBut to the show's credit, it does dedicate a decent amount of time framing the characters' mindsets so that the audience has an understanding as to what makes them tick, as well as why they carry themselves in the way they do. This is made all the more commendable given that a majority of them have despicable personalities. You don't necessarily have to like them, but you do understand how their thought process operates under certain circumstances. This is the definitive attribute it has over its much more cruddy sibling, School Days, where no time or effort was dedicated to any of the main lead's concubines. Scum's Wish, at the very least, gives the illusion that the characters presented are their own person, as with School Days, they were all just assembly-line fuck buddies. Not that it isn't the same case with Scum's Wish, in due time, they're all just reduced to sexual encounter cannon fodder as well. But with the time given beforehand to at least probe their psyche and reasoning behind their actions, they could still be considered to be \"characters\" by the end of it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of School Days, not surprising enough, this sleazy brainchild was also penned by the same scriptwriter as well, Makoto Uezu. The man tends to over exaggerate everything he writes, and where that proves successful with his efforts in comedy-centric shows, for dramas, they have the adverse effect, as demonstrated here, in Arslan Senki, Akame ga Kill and of course, everyone's favorite, School Days. Adequately written drama is not the man's forte. \\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of dramas that became unintentionally funny or embarrassing, Scum's Wish is also plagued with random \"comedic\" cutscenes that began and ended with no discernable reason or benefit for the tone of the series. This usually occurred after an emotionally heavy scene, having the same terrible effect in the way Akame ga Kill would randomly cut to comedic hijinks after someone gets brutally murdered. Whether we could pin this similarity as another fault of Uezu is unknown, as this might just be a result of what the manga does than what the adaptation might be responsible for. Either way, it's a lousy attempt at levity that comes across as awkward the first handful of times it's used. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the actual art and animation of the show demonstrated some thoughtful consideration of how it was constructed. By incorporating panel strips to make scenes flow together\u2014visually emulating manga image tiles\u2014Scum's Wish was able to convey more information by not only accounting for the character's reaction towards a situation but also drawing attention to certain critical moments as they pertain to the people involved within the frame. This allowed the audience to get a general sense of the mood or mindset that's being conveyed by placing a fixated point of interest with things boxed off within the manga panel tiles as it relates to the overall scene. The talented duo behind this thoughtful bit of storytelling was Yukie Oikawa and Masaomi Andou, who's past collaborative efforts together created the technical wizardry demonstrated in Gakkougurashi, where they both made their best Satoshi Kon impression. \\n\\n\r\nCapitalizing off that, the art department showed a keen eye for color placement as well, with cool and warm colors striking a delicate balance, bringing with it visual chemistry on screen. Nothing overpowers the other unless it's done to insinuate a particular mood. An example of which is when they purposely chose to plunge the entire palette in monochromatic blues and dark purples to help give a feeling of isolation, only to use that same coloring technique with soft touches and color highlights to be used for times of intimacy. It's this firm grasp the creators had over color theory that allowed for selective color choices to serve dual purposes under the right guidance.\\n\\n\r\nThey also used splodges of ink and watercolor paint during cutscenes to represent a myriad of emotions and ideas, like lustful desire and deflowerment. While done with no subtlety whatsoever, it was still a nice touch. And even when everything was more than likely digitally colored in, they didn't use that for shorthand around adding personal touches, often giving things soft pastel-like textures and occasional color-penciled-in still shots placed throughout for good measure. Even the character designs are an excellent standout, having anatomically believable body proportions that help the viewer buy into their placement as people within the story. \\n\\n\r\nWith sharp edits used to juxtapose certain situations and letterboxing being applied to convey certain pivotal moments, every idea here was given careful consideration. Yukie Oikawa's acquired abilities from early documented work on Noir up to now has made this a show with a steady hand for cinematics, even if only on a smaller, manageable scale. And to be honest with you, this overall care given for its presentation might be the most significant saving grace for this show. Without it, the show's gimmicky content would be way more apparent than it is now.   \\n\\n\r\nWell, at least for everything within the show, as for the opening and ending themes, however, things couldn't have been more ridiculous had it tried. Starting off with a goofily blaring vocal performance and a flurry of rose petals, the imagery and song throughout the opening were pretty overblown; especially when it hammered home symbolism that felt tacky in comparison to what was presented in the show. But to its credit, the tune wasn't bad on the ears if you just let it play out absent-mindedly. As bad as it may have gotten at times, it doesn't come close to touching the ending theme's issues. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme's visuals were so blatant and try-hard that they actively made me cringe. It reminded me of Zayn's \"Pillowtalk\" music video, which is never a good thing since that was basically the equivalent of someone screaming:\\n\r\n\"Get it BRUH? The FLOWERS represent VAGINAS and WOMEN'S WOMB... and like SEX and stuff, ain't I clever fam?!\"\u2014like no, just stop, you're embarrassing yourself and society. It's the kind of imagery a 15-year-old going through their \"emo phase\" would create, as they wear their Sid Vicious necklace and blast Linkin Park and Pierce the Veil in youthful revolt. By using a mixture of kaleidoscopic visuals to create phallic images, the whole thing aims for contemporary sex appeal along the lines of an FKA Twigs music video but ends up falling incredibly short. It had the tone of a former Nickelodeon child star trying desperately to break free of their kiddie image by being super raunchy. \\n\\n\r\nHaving \"mature themes\" and being \"maturely handled\" aren't the same thing. And when it comes to Scum's Wish, this is an applicable distinction to keep in mind, as the show crosses the line thinking they're one in the same on several occasions. And it's perhaps this issue that's the show's greatest downfall, as it relates to one of the bigger pending problems that need addressing; the character's awareness of themselves and each other. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have this uncanny ability to not only know the inner-workings of their own thought process but also that of everyone around them as well, like if they were all psychology majors. The internal reflection was appreciated, but knowing the mindset and framework of everyone else was a bit ridiculous. Realistically speaking, there should only be two characters in the entire show with that kind of mental capacity, and that were the adults. As a teen, one's ability to discern self and the disposition of others are only achievable on a superficial level. This isn't an \"opinion,\" this is a scientific fact. \\n\r\nI've been in similar situations before as a teen, acting on sexual impulse, but was I fully aware of my decisions to the point of self-reflection? No, because I was horny, not some man musing about life and his choices. This anime treats teens like adults. The phrase \"young, dumb and full of cum\" isn't just passed around to describe youths for a good laugh, it's an expression born from the fact that during that turbulent time of change in your life, teenagers are shortsighted and driven by impulse. You don't start truly thinking with your prefrontal cortex\u2014the rational part of your brain\u2014until you've hit your early to mid-20s when it has fully developed. \\n\\n\r\nWhenever the characters experience emotional woes regarding their actions, that's natural, and again, commendable for the show for trying to depict that. But it's the moment they all become Dr. Phil that it loses touch with itself and reality. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I think I've danced around this long enough.\\n\\n\r\nI'm trying my best not to state the obvious here, but fuck it, time to state the ugly truth of the matter. If your closest thing to intimacy is the love you received from your family, with little to no experience in an actual relationship, then what Scum's Wish depicts may come across more realistic to you than what is actually true. If you only watch anime and haven't ventured out to other mediums, then Scum's Wish offerings may also seem more novel than what it is. However, if sexual relationships\u2014especially in the form of \"fuck buddies\" that this title plays with\u2014are something you've had some passing experience with or hell, if you've seen/read enough other media centering around the subject, then chances are, what Scum's Wish offers to you may be nothing more than animated sleaze. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime's value could easily sway in either direction given the experience of the viewer that looks at it. As such, it's a show that's bound to cause contention among those that adore it and others that mock it. Of course, all of this doesn't even matter if you just want to be entertained, because if that's the case, there's nothing here worth reading that would dissuade you in the slightest. But if for some reason you happen to fall into that small camp that dissects and discuss the content they watch, this show would be met with coin toss results. \\n\\n\r\nYour level of acceptance for what the show depicts depends entirely on your tolerance or love for certain narrative decisions. As for me, I don't see any reason to get up in arms about it. If you see it for what it is, there's no reason to get upset. \\n\\n\r\nScum's Wish lives in a vacuum. Real life is never so perfectly contrived. So instead of focusing on what it mirrors from societal norms, what should be looked at is what it does within the confines of its narrative. And when seen for what it is and not what outside influence it is not, the answer derived is pretty clear; Scum's Wish in its rudimentary form is quite literally animated smut. Meaningful at times but smut nonetheless. That age-old adage \"sex sells\" that's expressed by everyone, from your critics to your everyday viewer, isn't one to easily shake off. It's a commonly known truth for a reason. Sex in and of itself is not a bad topic to center around. It's a natural act we partake in. The issue is when sex is reduced to nothing more than a meal ticket to get audiences through the front door. At that point, any kind of message the show may have had becomes null and void. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, what saved me from entirely dismissing Scum's Wish was the overall care given for its presentation, the extra time dedicated to at least exploring the characters involved, and the fact that content of this perverse nature is easily digestible on a basic entertainment level. As far as anything content-wise is concerned, it falls incredibly short of any meaningful passages in its narrative, save for the individual pockets of occurrences that get drowned out in all the clutter. When everything is said and done, Scum's Wish is a pretty porcelain vase; something beautiful to look at for a while but when peered into, just turns out to be a hollow shell.",

            "content": "Love is perhaps one of the most complicated feelings in the world. We may all have experienced sometimes in our lives. Whether it\u2019s platonic, romantic, or parental, it\u2019s something that humans feel because that\u2019s who we are. As part of growing up, people learn to understand these feelings. Yet, there are also people who make stories out of their lives from such feelings, in ways that become so twisted and disjointed that they become scum. Welcome to Kuzu no Honkai, a show that gives the characters a chance to grow up.\r\nAs a manga reader, I was already prepared although it\u2019s easy to judge by thepremise that the story itself will be saturated with drama. Ever heard of \u2018friends with benefits\u2019? That\u2019s pretty much how the premise sounds like. In the beginning of the story, we learn quickly that Hanabi and Mugi are engaged in a \u201crelationship\u201d that seems like those of a happy couple. Yet deep down, both suffers from pain because they are in love with someone else and are only using each other to ease their pain. It\u2019s not hormone that\u2019s driving these young folks into engaging in sex but that they simply want to feel something rather than pain. I have to admit, a show like this definitely takes on a more mature approach at romance than your typical high school rom-com. Make no mistake about it, Kuzu no Honkai is an emotional story that deconstructs romance in many ways more than one.\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast is small yet complex because almost every character has their own personal issues. Some are more complex than others as the show focuses on them in their own twisted stories. A primary example is Akane, the seemingly lovable teacher. Yet, as the story progresses, you\u2019ll quickly learn that she isn\u2019t exactly what appears to be. Fans could easily label her as a bitch in sheep clothing and hard to accept. It\u2019s also relatable too as Akane is a type of character that can easily be encountered in real life. That\u2019s what also makes this show more realistic than some others as Kuzu no Honkai demonstrates a lot of realism. Relationships draws a line between love and sex. Can sex lead to actual love? Or is it just sex?\\n\\n\r\nIn the meantime, character relationships in the show deconstructs what you\u2019ll find in most romance stories. Yes, there are love triangles but Kuzu no Honkai has characters that uses others to satisfy themselves. Hanabi and Mugi is one but many examples. We\u2019ll also learn in the show of how childhood friends will take the risk of being rejected and hurt. The fact is, no one is really safe of being happy in this series. Happiness is more like an illusionary word in the world of Kuzu no Honokai. Even when certain truths are realized and confessions are made, it is the stone cold truth that brings in even more pain. It doesn\u2019t fall for every circumstance in the show as some characters are more willing to accept reality. However, the truth is still there that makes character relationships in this series seem like a losing battle. That\u2019s a tough pill to swallow.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can imagine, the show is drama heavy with a lot of emotions. Jealousy, regret, greed, hopeful, mistrustful, fear, are just a few to name. Action has consequences and this show brings out the worst out of human behavior. Think about it really. Kuzu no Honokai translates to Scum\u2019s Wish as the title references to one\u2019s interest to satisfy their own desires. Most of the characters does this and is drawn by humans emotions. At the core of these emotions is love. However, this show deconstructs love and very few characters actually understands it. Or perhaps there is no real answer because everyone has different perceptions. Narumi (Hanabi\u2019s homeroom teacher) is a rare example in this show where he accepts certain people for who they are even after learning the truth. Still, the truth can hurt doesn\u2019t it?\\n\\n\r\nYes, don\u2019t expect much comedy or humor from Kuzu no Honkai. It occasionally throws in some comedy from time to time but the majority of the show retains its mature feel. Now, the anime portrays sex as what it is and believe me, there\u2019s a decent amount of it. The manga even has more explicit scenes to illustrate its point. So in essence, this show is not designed for a younger audience but suitable for those looking into a serious yet twisted story. The word \u2018love\u2019 doesn\u2019t fit in there as that word is more or less an illusion. Still, I am happy that the adaptation captured the general idea of the original manga. It sticks to its point without derailing from its coming of age feel while inserting human emotions.\\n\\n\r\nLerche surprisingly did a fairly decent job at crafting the artwork. Character designs look mature especially for the adults such as Akane and Narumi. Ebato has that pure nature lady look that makes her desirable. However, Moca\u2019s character design can be bothersome to get used to as she looks like a child being stuck in a mature world. Be aware that the show has a lot of fan service such as make out scenes, sex, and other suggestive innuendos. One thing I am impressed by the artwork is how there are certain scenes in the show that captures the characters\u2019 expressions at fullest. It accomplishes this with a more detailed visual of their feelings but importantly makes them look impactful.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and music retains a somber tone. It\u2019s a drama heavy story so what else did you expect? It has a feel of melancholy throughout the series along with light instrumental OST. Music director Masaru Yokoyama (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans) does a fantastic job at the directing as expected. The OP and ED theme songs have some symbolism along with a drama-like tone. But in terms of voice mannerisms, this is where it gets sort of mixed. Characters such as Akane and Ebato are really hard not to feel attracted to with their mature voices. In the meantime, I have to mention again that Moca is a source of annoyance whenever she opens her mouth.\\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honokai is like walking into a world of twisted desires. It\u2019s like going into a maze with endless doors and no way out. Behind every door is a truth or lie that brings anything but joy. However, I think the show does bring up a good point of showing the realism of love. Examples in this series can really happen to anyone and realistically, it does. It\u2019s part of us being human as there\u2019s no real answer to what love is. Or to put it simply\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nLove hurts.\\n",

            "content": "Kuzu no Honkai has finished airing and it's been a fun ride, so let's talk about the show.\r\nKuzu no Honkai is not your tipical romance anime, I've seen many people complaining about it and I understand them (especially after the last two episodes that destroyed my favourite character's personality), as a matter of fact this anime is not suited for everyone: as the title suggest the story revolves around scummy people and their desires, so there's nothing pleasurable to be seen. \r\nStory: 7\r\nKuzu no Honkai is the story of a girl who discovers her true feelings through sexual growth.\r\nThe story's intro is quite interesting: thetwo main characters try to find solace in each other because they actually love their teachers. After this some supporting characters are introduced and the story takes a twisted and fucked up turn. If you don't care about romantic relationships you'll enjoy the anime until the last episodes, where everything was rushed and hadn't a proper explanation. But I have to say that I really liked how the show ended, I didn't see that coming. Overall it's not bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 \\n\r\nThe art is beautiful and I love the animation: the VN like sequences were pretty good and fit the mood of the story. \\n\r\nHowever I found the character design a bit bland, the male characters looked very much alike, I swear I wouldn't have recognised them apart without checking their hair colour. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\r\nThis show has one of the best soundtracks among the animes of the winter season; the piano OSTs were soothing and relaxing. Also the voice acting was ok, nothing bothered me about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7 \\n\r\nThe characters aren't stereotyped and they undergo some development throughout the show (many of them are really worthy \"scum\" as the title suggests), but I didn't like the sudden and rushed change of some characters, these changes felt unrealistic and forced.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 \\n\r\nWhen I watched the first episode I couldn't handle my curiosity and I read the manga. The anime ended before the manga and I liked it, I was never bored when I was watching Kuzu no Honkai even though my expectations were maybe a little too high after reading the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 \\n\r\nThis show deserves a chance, it's not a conventional romance; if you're looking for something original and psychological and you don't care about ships give this show a try. It is very good in its horribility.",

            "content": "Kuzu no Honkai (Scum\u2019s Wish) portrays how we all have a desire, oftentimes bad or \u201cscum\u201d type of desires and how we act upon those desires. This anime is not for the lover of sweet romance because the story is a bit psychological and melancholic. Here\u2019s the reason why I keep watching and waiting for the next installment of the episodes.\r\nStory: 9\r\nI like the narration of the story here. You can see clearly in the story why the character or the story ended up that way because it was narrated very well. Aside from that, after every episode, there is a dialogue/monologue from a characterthat would leave you wanting to watch more.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe animation/art is very clean and easy to look at. I usually don\u2019t like fight scenes in an anime because of too much color in it. You could also see that there are times that the artwork will change, like how the expression or color of the eyes will change, suggesting or telling the audience what the character feels or thinks at that exact moment. The part where there is a word written in pink background that suddenly goes black is a very good indication of something psychological. The ending animation is also very well done, as if the stories of the characters where just a glimpse in a kaleidoscope; with just a simple turn, the image changes, so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe background sounds almost always fits the emotion, scenery, situation and animation. It\u2019s complimenting the story and the art. And about the soundtracks, the dialogue at every ending blended with the entry of the ending song is a total killer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe characters\u2019 development and personality is also very good. They\u2019re hopeless romantics, melancholic, and desperate and sees the world in only one direction which kind of make the characters more real.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nDid I enjoy the anime? I would not wait every Thursday for 9 hours just to watch the next installment if I didn\u2019t! Maybe we all just love to have a little drama in our lives, and Kuzu no Honkai surely satisfy those needs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI like how the characters were drawn, how the expression on their eyes changes which gives clues as to what the character is feeling or thinking at that moment. At first, I just like the animation, but I think the story is a bit hard to handle. But as I watched the episodes again, I started to like the story. The way the characters think, their being hopeless romantics, and their melancholy and desperation makes the story so real. The characters\u2019 dialogue at the end blended with the entry of the ending song is a total killer.\\n\\n\r\nThe only let down is that the story and animation are so mature, I can\u2019t watch it at the living room.\\n",

            "content": "Have you gotten sick of \"romance\" anime consisting of nothing but innocent teenagers blushing like tomatoes at the mere thought of holding hands yet? Are you sick of seeing \"relationships\" implying that there may or may not be a confession in the last minute of the final episode and nothing beyond that? Well then Kuzu no Honkai might be for you, because this anime has more romantic progression in its first five minutes than most romance anime do in their entire runtime, and it manages to break one, two, maybe even three taboos in the process as well.\r\nKuzu no Honkai at heart represents the uglinessof human emotions and carnal base desires. It looks into the darker side of romance and tackles matters which romance anime basically never does. This is not a story about how to woo your would-be waifu of choice, but rather it deals with issues such as how to emotionally cope with having an impossible unrequited love, reflecting on yourself as a human being and opening your eyes to your own flaws, and considering what it must be like for the target of your unrequited affection if you force your own feelings onto them. It showcases how love truly is blind and that you can end up falling for the wrong person against your better judgement, and you just cannot help but desire them anyway. It is a very depressive and heart-wrenching story throughout, but also psychological and packed to the brim with moral lessons to be learned. And it all culminates in one of the most unique, artistic and legitimately fascinating romance anime I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways, Kuzu no Honkai is effectively the polar opposite of most romance anime. Mind you, that does not mean that it is too much more realistic; in fact Kuzu no Honkai is just as exaggerated except in the opposite direction. While the characters are all (more or less) realistic individually, the fact that they all happen to be such emotionally broken wrecks and that they are somehow all connected in one big messy love polygon at the same time is a bit too implausible. However, realism is ultimately not the main purpose of this story, but rather to provide a significantly less glorified outlook on romance that showcases that love is not always easy and not always as beautiful as anime generally likes to make it out to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing I really like about Kuzu no Honkai is how it does not beat around the bush. Whilst most anime characters seem scared to even hold hands with their respective crush, in this anime we have Mugi and Hanabi willingly tongue-wrestling with each other within the first three minutes of the first episode. This then proves to be nothing more than a prelude of what is to come as the anime has a lot of actual sexual interaction between numerous different characters over the course of the story. However, it is also done in a way which makes it seem like it is not really a big deal to have sex, and that it is something merely a natural part of relationships or even done just for the sake of emotional comfort. You are never given the impression that the sex scenes in Kuzu no Honkai are anything perverted or something out of the ordinary enough to freak out about. This is also largely attributed to the very artistic directing of the anime. What might otherwise have been written off as nothing but smut ends up coming across as something poetic and emotional, albeit perhaps not straight-up beautiful due to the anime's rather questionable morals. The visuals make great usage of the original manga's design by actually showcasing a lot of screens with multiple manga style panels instead of normal full screen animation. It is a bit difficult to explain without seeing it with your own eyes, but I personally found it very effectual and artistic, and it greatly helped to set the rather melancholic tone of the anime as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nAt heart, the anime is mostly about hopeless affections. The two main characters Mugi and Hanabi are both in love with someone else who they know they can probably never have, and only utilize each other as replacements for their actual crushes. But they are not the only outcasts in this anime as amogst the other people involved in the love polygon we have a homosexual, a man-eating slut, and more. Everyone has some sort of deep-rooted emotional issue as for why their feelings are almost assuredly never going to transcend into mutual love along with their crush, and they all have different ways of trying to deal with it, such as self-denial, clouding of judgement, or just selfishly forcing their feelings upon their beloved regardless of the consequences. This all results in the whole situation becoming increasingly messy and entangled with each passing episode, which makes the story both unpredictable and dramatic, but it also fills you with some sort of sadistic pleasure by watching everyone's worlds continuously come crumbling down, solely to then be able to watch in fascination how the characters somehow try to climb out of the holes they themselves created. It is a pretty typical case of curiosity killed the cat.\\n\\n\r\nThe main question you have to ask yourself whilst watching this anime is \"what is the right thing to do?\" in the characters' respective circumstances. More often than not, the logical answer and the emotional answer stand in direct contradiction to one another. Their heads tell them that they should try to let go of their hopeless feelings of affection, but their hearts say that they have to keep pushing forward, no matter the cost. And really, you cannot say that one option is any more or less \"correct\" than the other. Is it acceptable to sacrifice someone else's happiness in pursuit of your own, and is it okay to keep feigning ignorance of reality just because the current lie you are living in \"feels good\"? There is not really a right answer here, as regardless of what you do, someone is guaranteed to end up miserable and unhappy in the end no matter what, and Kuzu no Honkai showcases this dilemma to great effect.\\n\\n\r\nOf course that is not to say that there are not a couple of times where I feel like the writers go a bit too far whilst trying to overplay the misery that Kuzu no Honkai has to offer. Especially Akane--who is arguably the real bad guy in this mess (if you can call her that)--sometimes feels a bit *too* malicious. The way she just casually tries to break Hanabi's heart in the most sickening ways possible time and time again feels like it goes a bit beyond what her own motivations seem to rationally justify that she should want to, and there is also one scene where you can see her sadistically licking her lips the way a second-rate villain from some B movie would do... which seems like they writers are trying to force on the image that \"this woman is evil\" a bit too directly. That is not to say that Akane does not function as a villain though because she is certainly a character you love to hate, but I cannot help but find the way they reached that goal to have been a bit forced at times.\\n\\n\r\nIn the grand scheme of things though, the hiccups of Kuzu no Honkai are rather sparse in comparison to how many good things there are about it. It is an unorthodox and exceptionally well-written show with very interesting characters. It also has some very artistic directing in general and even boasts with having some absolutely superb opening and ending themes. And while the story as a whole might still feel a bit implausible at times, it nonetheless gets its messages across in great fashion. Ultimately, what you are left with is one of the most memorable romance dramas in a very long time, and although it is certainly not an anime for everyone given its controversial themes, I think it is also one of those shows which if you manage to see it for what it truly is, then there really are not very many series quite like it. Overall, Kuzu no Honkai is probably the best romance anime I have seen in the last few years, and one I will eagerly recommend people for a long time to come as well.",

            "content": "Since episode 2 I'm waiting for this anime to just deliver the final blow so I can finally drop it in peace (and for good this time). Not because it's complete garbage\u2026 But the way it's going right now, I really don't know for how much longer I can sit through this. Good heavens. \u00d4_\u00d3\r\n\u201eScum's Wish\u201c, more like \u201eFriends With Benefits: The Anime\u201c is about people being each other's replacements for people they cannot have. Which is an interesting premise, that anime as a medium hasn't explored too often yet, I agree. Nonetheless it's also a premise that can be ruined spectacularly with so littleeffort, and I feel like it's already taking that route.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (5/10):\\n\r\n- up until now, nothing but wasted potential. The majority of episode 1 seemed so very interesting, but I feel my expectations shattering more and more with every new episode :'D What expectations? Well I certainly didn't expect a freaking jizzfest, which by now, it totally is. You may think I'm just oversensitive here, when I'm in fact all for anime showing and exploring sexuality more (and better) than it has until now, really. But guys... When an anime that's partially ABOUT physical intimacy makes me cringe whenever there's physical intimacy...it's doing something terribly wrong. I came here to watch characters cope with all the struggles and emotions that may come with screwing around- NOT to actually watch the characters screw around all the time.\\n\r\nMaybe anime's just really bad with sex scenes in general. Still, this one would definitely be a lot better if it reduced its amount of sex ever so slightly and would use that extra time to...idk, maybe handle its core themes a little better instead. For example by exploring the characters' complex emotions a little more deeply/detailed, but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (5/10):\\n\r\nThey're scum, hence the title LOL- No I'm not even kidding, they're all kinda slutty and really unlikable most of the time (especially the main girl and the \u201cantagonist\u201c), - Which isn't automatically a bad thing, I even think it's one of the show's strengths.\\n\r\nWhen a character isn't just unlikable though, but also starts making fucking dumb or utterly selfish decisions...then I don't want to root for them anymore, I'm sorry. For god's sake, I can't even empathize with the redhead anymore, they managed to ruin the one gay character within just 1-2 episodes. Basically just shortly after I'd even figured out she's gay, so at least I didn't have enough time to hope for a proper character arc in the first place. Joke's on you!\\n\r\nAnyway, onwards to the other (attention-) whores: \u2026 Do I even care enough at this point? Dear Kuzu no Honkai, if you want to make me care, you have to show me something more than characters being hopelessly infatuated with one another like, 24/7. Don't they like, do or think about anything else? If so, then show me. If not, they're the most unrealistic and unlikable bunch of twats I've seen in anime :'D I guess we'll just have to wait and see. And hope for lots, LOTS of character-development.\\n\\n\r\nART (8/10):\\n\r\nI like it, very much so. I think it's pulling off that novel-y style with the written words and floating images really well. Then there's this lack of outlines, which may look a little weird at first, but I find it very pretty and refreshing :) So luckily, however dumb the story might still get, the art is and will always be beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (7/10):\\n\r\nIt's funny how the opening's the one thing that made me come back after I had initially dropped the show. That's how insanely good it is...!!! I love that song, I love the visuals \u2026 so pretty. Why can't the show be more like its OP :') The background music and sound in general are alright as well. Oh, except the kissing sounds. They're horrible.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (4/10) ---> OVERALL (5,8/10):\\n\r\nI want to enjoy this show, I really do. Not least because its themes are so relatable and common (to a certain extent). But instead of teaching me stuff, I feel like Kuzu no Honkai is doing NOT A THING the way I'd EVER do it.\\n\r\nSo no, I can't get anything from this show (yet), wake me up when I care. Though I can't bring myself to rate it too low either, it's not that bad... Let's just hope it gets more...insightful, meaningful, deeper, whatever. Just make it better! And let's hope the plot isn't actually that predictable as it seems (cos it seems awfully predictable).",

            "content": "From the Writer of School Days comes SCHOOL DAYS 2 Electric Boogaloo. Every so often there's that one anime that the masses throw roses to that I just don't get, Higurashi, Elfen Lied, Sword Art Online, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. \r\nI'll have to let Scum's Wish (Kazu no Honkai) be a good reminder to really examine the premise of a show more closely before watching.  The genres were interesting enough to catch my eye in the first place, romantic drama, psychological and so on it sounded like good makings for a more serious romance after watching the more light hearted and bubbly romance shows thatI loved such as One Week Friends, Yona of the Dawn and Snow White With the Red Hair so the best I could hope for is something like Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (Kannazuki no Miko) but rather I ended up with was School Days redux that mysteriously is trending better than School Days for the supposed \"maturity\" it has.  \\n\\n\r\nThe basic concept of two teenagers forming a pact to quell their loneliness should sound and come as a heart breaking romance or the potential of a feel good story where they find the love with each other or learn to accept and move on from their first loves or just face the trials of young love in general, a multitude of ways but the first episode left such a sour taste in my mouth that I only hope for a miserable end to our two little losers who deserve what they get.  \\n\\n\r\nHanabi Yasuroka is in love with an older man who is her teacher but curiously refers to him as her older brother despite no relations and Mugi Awaya likewise is in love with a teacher that appears to be in love with the man who Hanabi is in love with but in reality is a sexual sadist who enjoys using men.  Then we're introduced to Noriko Kamomebata who is in love with Mugi and then to Sane Ebato who is in love with Hanabi! Can this awful love web become more convoluted and ridiculous?\\n\\n\r\nThough having no actual romantic ties our two main characters certainly love to get physical enough to have the most casual sex and try to write it off as nothing and love to deny being anything more than cheap friends with benefits.  Anime fans laud this show for the \"maturity\" but casual sex in an anime isn't maturity it's just fanservice that goes a little further than the usual bouncing boobs and panty shots we're usually treated to in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode by itself is a mess in structure jumping between time periods of past and present and the confusing referral of Hanabi's love interest as her brother leads a viewer to believe this may be an incest based anime.  In fact I'm convinced that's why is just to give it an incest angle for the incest fetish without having to do incest. The second episode began to narrow its focus but everything keeps jumping around it becomes hard to tell what is ever going on at any given time because of the massive story leaps but by later episodes it begins to take on more linear approaches and calms down long enough to focus on moments when our characters aren't doing tongue action every five minutes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very nice looking it is pretty with some interesting use of panel shots replicating the feel of a manga without overdoing it (see 3 Gatsu no Lion for that) but they have a real tendency to abuse the hidden eyes trope many anime do wherein a characters eyes will disappear either to reflect deep emotion or be scary and intimidating for a moment.  Many anime as I mention do this from time to time but I can't say I've seen an anime do it so much.\\n\\n\r\nAnd musically the show's melodic score does enrich the atmosphere it's just a shame it's wasted on such a terrible concept. I can't say any one piece really stands out or underscores moments so perfectly but it does feel suited for the moments at each hand.\\n\\n\r\nScum's Wish I feel is trying to go for a \"so uncomfortable\" vibe, which can be done well, one only need watch David Fincher films but the cast of deplorable characters added with the sappy, convoluted over the top writing make this show unbearable to sit through.",

            "content": "You can easily say that Kuzu no Honkai (Scum\u00b4s wish) without a doubt has been one of the big talks of the winter 2017 season. Either people praise this new angle on a romance story in anime, or are disturbed by the emo depressed characters that does one scummy thing after another. \r\nWell, Scum\u00b4s wish for shore manages to separate itself from its siblings in the genres, much do to with that it is including sex as one of the big factors. Because let\u00b4s be honest, most high school kids are exploring their sexuality and are not going out for months before they have theirfirst glowing wonderful kiss (which often is the case in many anime\u00b4s). It\u2019s often much less romantic than that. That at least Scum\u00b4s wish manage to portray very well \u2013 often you don\u00b4t need to have romantic feelings or care for the person in question, for physical and intimate contact. Even if Scum\u00b4s wish is labelled as a \u201cRomance\u201d anime, there is very little actual romance in it. Other themes such as rejection, unrequired feelings, loneliness, egotism, replacement, sexuality, naivety, desire, selfishness, and jealousy are explored much more than an actual two-sided romance.  As for the characters \u2013 they truly are scum driven by instincts most of the time, and therefore are very hard to like or understand. At least they are to me. \\n\\n\r\nBut the question you probably having, is it any good or worth watching? I will get down to that now.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Character: 3,5/10\\n\r\nThe first words that\u2019s comes in mind to me are \u201cSoap opera with an emo-soft porn touch\u201d. As in many anime of this kind, the plot is mostly, if not only character driven. The plot is the character\u2019s actions, thoughts and interactions, therefore I\u00b4m bundling the story aspect and character aspect here in one. \\n\r\nThat\u00b4s not necessarily making this kind of show good or bad, it just is what is. But then all the weight is on the characters and if they fail to do their job to make you feel and care about them... Well, then the whole experience can become much less enjoyable then it could have been. The thing is that most of the characters in Scum\u00b4s wish is unlikable and hard to relate to. *light spoiler* Is there a time that you felt so lonely that you slept with your friend of the same sex, even do you are straight, just to feel less lonely? If not, you see my point. *end light spoiler* The characters are very self-centred, lost, egoistic and outright scum most of the time. You have Hanabi (female MC), who is a cute lonely/empty high school girl with a big brother complex and crush on her male teacher, Mugi (male MC), the normal but slightly depressed handsome high school boy with a slut teacher complex and a crush on his female music teacher, Moca, Loli childhood friend with long time crush on mentioned male MC, Ecchan, lesbian friend with a crush on female MC, Akane, said female music teacher with a thing for sleeping with men that have other women loving them (just to get the kicks off their sadness and jealousy), and a Nerdy, clueless and naive male teacher that has a shy personality and a mother complex. And there you have the set-up for this \u201clove\u201d hexagon. Many times, I almost wished for that bad things would happen to them because they kind of deserved it. In the same time, I was kind of enjoying this new input in an anime, you aren\u00b4t meant to like the characters. They are deliberately written like that and that\u00b4s also what\u2019s makes Scum\u00b4s wish interesting in its own way. So even if I really disliked the characters (some much more than others \u2013 yes, looking at you Akane), they still managed to make me want to watch them and their drama. Who was going to get rejected/fucked/used/do something randomly humiliating next? This phenomenon made me want to know what weird thing was going to happen next, and to keep watching this emo-soft porn drama week after week. A large amount of the show focuses on the character\u2019s thoughts and reasoning\u2019s. Most of the time it\u00b4s kind of depressing emo-philosophical stuff about the unrequired love, loneliness, how a bad of a person he/she is and how they use people, and the wish to change oneself. As mentioned before, the romance/love aspect is almost absent \u2013 most of the time there\u00b4s about desire and filling an empty place (both literally and figural speaking). And about control and sooth one\u2019s boredom or loneliness. And by doing so getting involved with multiple people without give a shit about their feelings, to fill this empty place in one\u00b4s heart, soul, and\u2026 You get it. Other than emo-emotional/sexual stuff revolving the characters it isn\u00b4t much to the story. So, if you can put up with that, go ahead and watch it. If not, this is probably not for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation is pretty great \u2013 it has a certain quality about it. Mostly in form of shoujo beautiful backgrounds and scenery\u2019s. Much effort has also been put on more detailed parts, such as the character\u2019s eyes, with multi-layered colours and lights, or rain drops that\u2019s falls and causes ripples in a puddle. And the blushing and sweating of sexually aroused characters is\u2026 hum... very pronounced. The colour palette that is used is very aquarelle with a wide spanning of the colour spectrum. It has a softness to it that is quite a contrast to the characters/story. The character designs are nothing unique or special. They have a pretty common anime standard design. For the animation, it\u00b4s absolutely fine, but nothing outstanding either. It has few weird motions and angles, but didn\u2019t blow my mind either.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nFor the soundtrack a lot of piano/guitar combos are used, with a sadder/melancholic touch to it. Which I suppose matches the mental states of the characters. Vocal songs are used but not that frequently. All over decent in my opinion. The OP is actually pretty good, it\u00b4s an upbeat pop song that\u00b4s gives of more energy than anything in show itself. The ED\u00b4s is also pretty good, and which I think is supposed to reflect all the confusing and mixed emotions the characters are feeling.\\n\\n\r\nFor background sounds and such, it does its job but nothing especially memorable. Waring, a lot of slobby kissing sounds are present every episode. That could be a huge turn of for some viewers. For the VA\u00b4s (Japanese) I think they did their job pretty well. It would be exaggeration to say that they really brought life into their characters, because the characters themselves appeared pretty lifeless to me. But they did a good job with the character they had to work with.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nSo, was it any good? Not particularly for me, but Scum\u00b4s wish do have something that made me keep watching it and see if there is any progression of the characters and their wishes. Even if I didn\u00b4t really felt for the character\u2019s personalities, I still was somewhat entertained by this soft-porn emo drama anyway. Scum\u00b4s wish was something new I hadn\u00b4t watched 10 shows just like it before, and brought a new perspective to the genres. A little bit refreshing if nothing else. So, I enjoyed some of it, was disgusted by some of it, was irritated of some of it, and was pretty entertained of some of it. I would say, that for me it was worth the watch and I don\u00b4t want to charge anyone for my time back.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nThe unlikable characters both made this show to something new and interesting, and at the same time puts sticks in the wheel for its self. I became somewhat emotional invested in the characters but for the wrong reasons. I wanted bad stuff (some karma please) to happen to them because of their egoistic and often childish behaver. But I definitely can\u00b4t call Scum\u00b4s wish boring or particularly bad. It still manages to entertain me to the degree of me watching it to the end, and be curious about what was going to happen next. So, I would not recommend this show for everyone, especially if you are looking for a cosy romance story. You aren\u2019t going to find any of that in Scum\u00b4s wish. But if you like the genres and want to see something that hasn\u00b4t been done before and give a new perspective, go ahead and dig in to the scummy characters of Scum\u00b4s wish.  \\n\\n\r\nI hope you found this review somewhat helpful and informative. Cheers! \\n",

            "content": "\u201cWhy can\u2019t it be me?\u201d\r\nLove and lust are two terms synonymous with the young and naive but understood by those who\u2019ve experienced both. \u201cLovesick\u201d teenagers are often impressionable and irrational, driven by an overwhelming cesspool of hormones and emotions. Love is ambiguous at a young age, and can often be a stifling enigma. Lust is an enveloping, instinctive thirst for a partner\u2019s sexual freedom. Although these concepts can be weighty and complicated, experiencing them is part of what makes us human, and are as intense as any incident we\u2019re likely to encounter in our lives. Scum\u2019s Wish is a visceral, raw and uncomfortable approach tolove and lust, and even deeper, what makes our minds tick from a relationship perspective. Does it succeed in translating the equivocal nature of human sexuality or does it miss the mark?\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by the small scale Studio Lerche (Assassination Classroom), Scum\u2019s Wish takes the concept of a love triangle to unfathomable new heights by adding a dynamic and cunning twist, where love escapes the limelight. What we\u2019re left with is an askew pile of sexual hatred and numbness that is downright unsettling. One night stands, homosexuality, virginity and incest are all covered at some point in the anime\u2019s short 12 episode run, in an attempt to unearth the deepest and darkest fantasies of virtually everyone in the cast. The problem is, to achieve this level of promiscuity, the writers lose the credibility they attempt to obtain due to the dialogue and monologues drowning in a sea of melodrama. \\n\\n\r\nOur main character, Hanabi is in love with her life long \u201cbrother\u201d figure Mr. Kanai, who in turn is in love with a fellow teacher, who just happens to be the apple of her classmate Mugi\u2019s eye, so naturally Mugi and Hanabi start a facade of a relationship to help them cope with the unattainable \u201cunicorn\u201d they\u2019ll never be with. Honestly, the whole premise sounds like a joke. Add in an aggressive lesbian who falls for Hanabi within minutes of being saved from a pervert on a crowded subway, a goodie two-shoes lolli who is unfailingly devoted to Mugi\u2019s love and a creeper who\u2019s constantly trying to molest his cousin and the wheels start to fall off the believability. Almost every facet of Scum\u2019s Wish revolves around sex, causing the series to be rather unnerving.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s one thing to talk about sensitive subject matter like chastity or innocence in an anime, but when it becomes diluted to the point of omission, the initial argument is lost entirely. Scum\u2019s Wish attempted to bombard its audience with too many sexual themes in too little time, resulting in a desensitized viewership just aching to skip ahead to the \u201clove scenes\u201d. If the point was to shower us in copious amounts of fanservice, it could\u2019ve been done with a lot less effort and cash. If the point was to incite pondering and stimulating intellectual debate about love and its many intricacies, each theme should\u2019ve been handled with care. Instead, these taboo topics become nonchalant and shadows of their former selves. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the anime are a mix of plausible and irrational. Although I added in the beginning that love can make us do the dumbest things, some of the behavior exhibited by Scum\u2019s Wish\u2019s cast is unbelievable at best. A teacher sleeping with her students has happened before, hell it\u2019s even been in the news. But the way it\u2019s scripted here seems slightly schizophrenic\u2026 revenge taken on a girl half your age to shelter your own inadequacies? Highly unlikely. I think Hanabi sleeps with everyone in the show, except the person she wants the most\u2026 but you know what, it\u2019s okay because she never went \u201call the way\u201d with any of them. She\u2019s incredibly dense, despite having an overwhelming barrage of internal monologues throughout the series, describing who she should be with next and why. The real question is, \u201cwhy do I even care about this?\u201d Mugi may be even worse, but being a teenage dude, his testosterone is probably blinding his potentially intelligent decisions. Mugi and Hanabi\u2019s relationship never really made sense to me, from inception to the conclusion of the series. It felt as though it only existed as a plot crutch, and to allow the writers to slam a bunch of other themes in our face along the way. \\n\\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t care less for the other characters in Scum\u2019s wish. Their sexual struggles always seemed to be the lifejacket keeping them relevant, though I couldn\u2019t get onboard with any of their causes. The empathy just wasn\u2019t there for me. Even Kanai, who I initially perceived to be the sole intelligent, unblinded character in the show succumbed to his libido and broke his innocence eventually. Scum\u2019s Wish tries to shove down our throat that it\u2019s okay to be a slut, everyone\u2019s doing it! But in all actuality, these characters are just playing out the desires our meek and timid selves are too reserved to pursue. And why does every character need to whisper all the damn time? I felt like every line was so soft and overexaggerated.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Scum\u2019s Wish is top notch, and when incorporated into certain scenes, really made my heart race. If there\u2019s one thing that Studio Lerche nailed (pun intended), it would be the orchestration of the love scenes. Sweat dripping, pulse pounding, moaning and blushing all around make this anime one not to watch with a friend, unless you want some supremely awkward silences or dinner conversations. The character models are attractive and crisp, while the environments (if you even noticed them) are accurate and consistent. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also a high point for me, definitely a soundtrack that fit the atmosphere of the show. Each sexual encounter was brilliantly timed with an epic addition of strings, while the plotting and scheming soliloquies were laden with an equally devious accompaniment. Ironically enough, I didn\u2019t really care for the OP, as it didn\u2019t really flow with the anime at all. A fast-paced JPop song with a relatively melancholy vibe just irked me. The ED was more appropriate, and really captured the tarnished innocence that Habani exuded throughout the series. Slightly haunting, and stunningly accurate. The voice acting was decent, though nothing out of the ballpark necessarily. I did like the apathy echoing through Habani\u2019s voice during her monologues, a nice job for sure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Scum\u2019s Wish was a promising anime that became corrupted by the oversaturation of its sexual themes. The result was an uncomfortable, guilty pleasure that is best reserved for watching by yourself, on an introverted, quiet night alone. Those of you less intellectual might want to grab a tissue, though not necessarily for tears\u2026 I can assuredly say that this series pushed the envelope of what I might find appropriate to watch in anime, and I haven\u2019t really seen anything like it before. I\u2019d recommend it if you are really into hormonal, melodramatic sexual escapades, or are looking for a show with adult subject matter and want something completely different. I enjoyed it, but not enough to say it\u2019s a must watch\u2026 and definitely not the anime of the season. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out the rest of my Winter \u201817 reviews!",

            "content": "Unrequited love presents a tiny window of hope on the verge of shattered by crippling depression and anxiety. To not be able to share yourself with the person who brings color to your world, even worse watch them fall for someone perceived as better than you, is a feeling will that leave your emotions on the brink of suicide as your scum filled obsessions grow too loud to silence anymore. \r\nKuzu No Honkai is a study on the psychology of unrequited love, how adolescents will make the mistake of equating self worth with sexual desirability and how that can inspire one to make terrible choicesout of desperation. This is not an anime about frivolous sex from horny kids. Kuzu No Honkai offers a nuanced take on the pursuit of love as a group of teenagers attempt to solve a common question that has no answers. \\n\\n\r\nMugi and Hanabi are the antithesis to your average romance protagonist - acting on their every sexual desire and being honest with themselves at the expense of other people's feelings. Growing frustrated with their unrequited feelings, The 17 year olds decide to use one another as substitutes in order to fulfill their raging desires. Make no mistake about it - this is a narrowminded, lust filled decision that only serves to make their misery even worse, but it's also realistic. Making rash in the moment choices is a consequence of love, and Kuzu No Honkai uses it's characters as a vehicle to explore these mistakes and what can evolve from them.\\n\\n\r\nMugi struggles with his own self worth, contemplating if hes nothing more than a human pillow for the opposite sex based on his encounters that extended no further than the bedroom. Mugi is an intelligent person who understands exactly what he wants. Just not necessarily how to capture it - a recurring theme of his character arc. \\n\\n\r\nAbandoned by her father at an early age, Hanabi subconsciously looks to patch that void in her heart with sexual partners. She yearns to be desired. To be obsessed over and idolized. This vain personality adds to the authenticity of her character as it's normal for humans to seek confirmation. She is less experienced than Mugi, but a quick learner that changes dramatically episode to episode for better or worse.\\n\\n\r\nGiven their issues they could not have chosen worse people to fall in love with - a narcissistic man eater in who is the finest specimen of slutiness that anime has possibly ever seen, and an oblivious innocent sensei who sticks out like a sore thumb among all the other twisted personalities around him. They are the source, if not the antagonist, for the drama in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs if this tangled web wasn't complicated enough, Mugi and Hanabi are both loved by friends who they don't feel the same towards. Noriko wants her Prince Charming Mugi all for herself, in need of a reality check in the worst way. Sanae is is infatuated to the point of unhealthy obsession with Hanabi. Through her is a well told yuri tale that highlights how difficult it can be for the queer to let go of people that won't reciprocate their feelings. \\n\\n\r\nKuzu No Honkai offers a balanced perspective with each character being given the opportunity to narrate their experiences. This levels the moral playing field making it clear that no one is being judged for their transgressions, and gives the viewer a chance to dive into their minds to get a better understanding for their choices. By the end it truly feels as if you've lived through these characters decisions - especially if able to connect to any of them personally.\\n\\n\r\nWhile many will flock to this anime for the sexual innuendo, Kuzu No Honkai isn't explicit just for the sake of it. Attached to every moment of passion is a deep inner monologue on its significance. Rather than the act itself, the rationale and consequences thereafter are emphasized most.  There's a large segment of the anime community that took issue with the gratuitous amount of sexual content, seemingly not understanding that sex is the end goal of mutual attraction. If anything romantic works should have more intimacy scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is sublime, helping to accentuate the somber atmosphere and offer smooth transitions into important scenes. The opening \"Uso no Hibana\" has a frantic pace that meshes well with the nonstop drama and helps to narrate the story itself. The final lyrics \"I'm in so much pain, I love you so much it scares me\" is literally everything this anime stands for. The ending \"Heikosen\" offers a slower, more intense contrast filled with kaleidoscope visuals that fits seamlessly as the closing credits begin.\\n\\n\r\nI had concerns as to how this anime would translate the heaviness of the manga. Key word had, those concerns were laid to rest minutes into the first episode - Studio Lereche does an admirable job of molding attractive character designs and creating an inviting aesthetic that suits the tone of the story. Director Masaomi Ando uses dramatic pauses frequently in moments of high tension, flashing Kanji across the screen when there's a cut in the animation, and is an expert at using paneling techniques to create flow in scenes. From an design perspective the eyes of each character stood out most - they look soulless, aligning well with the overall theme of narrow minded obsession. The color design is dark, much of the anime takes place in a dim lit room, and the director does a good job of using manga panels to help scenes flow to perfection. Make no mistake about it - this is a gorgeous looking work of art that anyone should be able to appreciate whether you agree with the story or not.\\n\\n\r\nKuzu No Honkai is the most controversial anime of the Winter season by a mile. There's been loud criticism of the characters being too depressing, lacking realism and making poor decisions. To those critics I must ask - what world do you live in where teenagers aren't indecisive flakes unsure of what they want? Part of being an adolescent is the period of self discovery through arduous trial and error. Most adults aren't able to follow through with all of their promises, let alone high school students who have just entered the precipice of puberty. Rather than give us cookie cutter characters who feign knowledge of the world, Kuzu No Honkai is filled with young people who are actively seeking answers to their problems confused about just where to go next in life. This anime does not lack authenticity - it succeeds as a portrayal of its themes by offering an ample amount of discussion on the minds of each character\\n\\n\r\nKuzu No Honkai takes an open mind to enjoy. If you go into it with a preconceived notion on how romance should be explored, or how much intimacy should be allowed in anime, you won't like it. If you can appreciate an anime that is willing to go the extra mile in order to explore a topic rarely touched upon in the genre, it can be one of the greatest romantic works you've ever encountered - that was certainly the case for me. In a genre filled with beauty Kuzu No Honkai chooses to be ugly, detailing a love gone wrong from every which angle for the world to see.",

            "content": "It's been so long since a studio has dared to release an anime like \"Kuzu no Honkai\". Ever since the creators of Aku no Hana got death threats for their show, studios have been reluctant to include depressive moods and apathy mixed with romance into their anime. Kozu no Honkai takes this exact step, but presents it in a more cheerful fashion that can apply to broader audiences.\r\nIf you are a fan of manga such as \"Oyasumi Punpun\" or \"Umibe no Onnako\" like me, this is the closest you can get to the same mood and atmosphere in new anime. If you are not, andjust like love triangles, this is a great opportunity to take a dive into the world of unrequited love where people become so mentally tormented that they settle for anything to suppress their feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are mentally destroyed, the detail and art are amazing, story is good(4 episodes in so far) and the characters are great.\\n\\n\r\nI want to emphasise the last point. I am a fan of every single character in this show. If you have ever been in love, you know that the characters are doing exactly what is supposed to be expected when you are head over heels for someone in a realistic way. The anime doesn't make the characters go yandere from love but instead, it makes them weak and vulnerable when they are around their beloved ones.\\n\\n\r\nI hope that this shows popularity will at least spike a small change in the anime business and hopefully we can get more of this type of mature romance anime out in the coming year.\\n\\n\r\nI will probably add a conclusion to this review once the series is finished, but right now all I can do is to enjoy the show :]",

I want to sleep with someone.\"\r\nDISCLAIMER #1: All opinions expressed in this review are mine alone, and you are not obligated to agree/disagree with them at all.\r\nDISCLAIMER #2: Don't be deceived by the genres listed on the left. Proceed with caution if you see dislike any of the themes presented below:\r\n\t*\tForbidden love\r\n\t*\tNetorare\r\n\t*\tSex and betrayal\r\n\t*\tYuri\r\n\t*\tLolis\r\nTLDR; Overall rating:  2/10 OR 8/10\r\nI will try and explain, as clearly as possible, the rationale behind the rating above, everything that this anime does right and wrong, and why you should or shouldn't watch it.\r\nStory: \r\nKuzu no Honkai is abreath of fresh air, a new and unique romance-themed anime that will leave you speechless - just kidding. Kuzu no Honkai is a story about a group of kids playing house, featuring wishy-washy characters in that high school setting we all know and love. Apparently they're calling it seinen now. \\n\\n\r\nThe basic premise consists of an intricate love triangle featuring a perpetually depressed flake of a girl, an emo boy-toy, a standard issue onii-chan, a cougar, a lesbian, and a loli. In episode 1, Person-X decides to have sex with Person-Y. Repeat this for 12 episodes with different combinations of X and Y and congratulations, you've finished this amazing series.\\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai is pretty much a hate-it-or-love-it kind of anime. The problem with this series is mainly how pretentious it appears to be. \"I'm 17 and I'm deep\" is the theme of the day. When I was in high school, the first and foremost thing on my mind was passing the university entrance exams. Relationships were important but I never forgot my priorities. Of course, that's only me, and you can't compare an anime to real life, but they wouldn't have made it a high school setting if they didn't want people to relate to it. I'll take the liberty to allude to Golden Time here: a similar romantic-themed anime placed in a university setting. For all its flaws, they at least they got that part right, and that made things a lot more real. Perhaps the setting is an unfair point of criticism, but the incredulity of it all was a dampening factor on my enjoyment of this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does this anime do right with the story? For starters, I find its openmindedness towards love quite commendable. Love knows no bounds in this anime: (low-key) incest, lesbianism, lolicon, student-teacher love. Phew! Raunchy stuff. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAverage 2017 animu art. However, one interesting thing about the art is how closely it resembles that of a shoujo anime - the suffocating close-ups, the excessive blushing, the simplistic nature of the backgrounds, fluidity with transitions, etcetera. Unassuming at times, allowing the viewer to focus completely on the trainwreck unfolding in front of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOne redeeming quality of the anime is definitely its music. The one thing you'd expect from the music would be to compliment what you see on screen, as opposed to jarr/seem out of place, and that's what the music did here. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (Minor revelations/spoilers, proceed with caution.)\\n\r\nWith the exception of Ecchan, pretty much everyone is a flake. \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with Hanabi. Supposed \"honour student\", has a thing for her onii-chan. Is fooling around with three different people at the same time in order to numb the pain of unrequitted love. Enjoys playing the victim card, is easily hussled into sex, and doesn't know how she feels 99% of the time about anything.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the emo boy-toy, who has such a bland personality that you wonder what women see in him at all.\\n\\n\r\nThird, we have a piano teacher who loves sleeping with underrage boys. And yet, Mugi the boy-toy enjoys perpetually jerking his little ding-dong to her, despite knowing what a tramp she is. Attraction to someone's looks is apparently called \"true love\" and entitles you to mope around 24/7 and wonder at how deep your life is.   \\n\\n\r\nFourth, we have a loli who is actually just a stuck up little bitch. Also an osananijimi who you know will lose just based the trope she represents.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, there really is nothing likable about any of these characters and you can't really relate to any of them, owing to how bland and pretentious they are. There is no real character development either, apart from little revelations about each ones' true colours, which I don't really consider development.\\n\\n\r\nI can, however, appreciate that this anime has some stellar relationship development. The true strength of Kuzu no Honkai, for me, lies in its character interactions. I keep harping on this, but the roller-coster relationships that characters experience with each other is actually quite realistic, and would have felt a lot more relatable in a university/work life setting.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis anime does not provide an iota of feel-good enjoyability at all. You will feel discomfort, jealousy, cringe, and at times, even disgust. But you'll probably want to keep watching with a grotesque interest that you'd have watching a butcher cutting up a piece of meat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIn the end, Kuzu no Honkai has its good points, but is a painful pill to swallow. Vaguely resembling a B-rate drama, if you derive any more enjoyment out of this than what you'd get from a cheap soap opera, I commend you. \\n\\n\r\nDepending on what parts of this anime you love or hate, you might end up calling this a 2/10 OR an 8/10. I recommend you watch and find out.",

            "content": "\"Kuzu no Honkai\" is the most fucked up show I've seen since \"School days\". Honestly, this show could be a Hit or a miss for most people. For me, fortunately or unfortunately it was big miss. Although I do appreciate the boldness to create and put out something like this this, can't say I'm a fan of it. \r\nThere really isn't much I can appreciate about the anime. It is a cringe-fest of a show with a few okay moments. There isn't much to the story, it isn't very eventful or progressive, it relies heavily on the discovery and the development of the characters, whichin my opinion is it's biggest flaw. There is not a single character I like in this show, Everyone is annoying as fuck and in no way relatable, they're so bland and poorly written, they all just seem like they are different versions of themselves. They are all so fucked up and their actions are so forced and predictable. Their dialogues are so corny and wannabe-deep. When their thoughts are narrated in a first person narrative it is sooo exhausting to even listen to them. Their designs are however not bad and there are a few comic moments that stood out and made them likeable, even if it was for just a moment. \\n\\n\r\nAnother huge flaw are the sex scenes, I don't have any problems with sex scenes but here it's just so forced and over-saturated, like there is a mandatory sex scene in every episode which kinda halts whatever this show is going for and gives us a few minutes of just pure cringe. it is just so uncomfortable to watch their movements and listen to their dialogues. They don't even really have sex, it's just boring to watch. If you're reading this and want to watch this show for this kinda content, I would suggest putting your dick back inside and look for something else lol. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I've seen this show being praised for is it's \"maturity\". Which I strongly disagree, although this anime does seem to have that kind of ambitions, it's stray far away from it or rather comes off as very pseudo-mature. Really, how does a bunch of junior high kids who try to compensate their desires and insecurities through such fucked up pretentious acts come off as mature? It's doesn't, Oh! and don't get me started on the slutty teacher character who does a bunch of crazy things too. It's not mature at all.  \\n\\n\r\nThe three things that I do like very much about this show are the Animation, Soundtrack and Voice acting. I appreciate Lerche studio's effort to tell this mess of a story as cohesive as possible. There is good detail and clarity in the animation which truly deserves praise. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really great too. I really like the OP and ED, the BGM  switches up at times and can come off as very unpredictable, which played a major role in helping me sit through this mess. One of the BGMs has like a Piano tune  kinda similar to Kanye West's \"Runaway\". That was really good, overall, great job with the soundtrack. The voice acting was noticeably great as well. Like I mentioned before, the anime is dark but it does have some comic moments, the voice actors transition so well at times like these, it's so genuine. Props to the voice actors.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, to me it's a frustrating watch and I wouldn't seriously recommend this to anyone. But there is some hype around this show at the moment, and some people do seem to like it for whatever reason so maybe you will too. If you're confused whether to watch it or not, just check out the first episode and maybe the second one too, if it intrigues you then continue, if you feel like I how I did, then just drop it.  \\n\\n\r\nMy rating for this show 3/10.",

            "content": "We think about life as a story. The politician too \u2013 and the gangster. And I would like to believe that both adulterers and the faithful think the same way. Some, perhaps, will make it into a story of triumph. You think, for example, that this isn\u2019t your fate. You have ambitions \u2013 and yet you are being tied down to the Earth \u2013 to this marriage that you chose out of either some bad circumstance or because you were blind in early love. Either way, the adulterer, wishing to be the hero/heroine of the story, will view it as a conquest of the soul.I have to do this, because my life will not be narrowed into such a stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is passion such an old theme? Because love has always been messy \u2013 so they say. I have not touched the Tale of Genji yet \u2013 supposedly the first psychological novel out there \u2013 but I hear that it is a great book on love. From what I know from reading bits and pieces of that Ecchi manga \u2013 Minamoto-kun Monogatari \u2013 it also seems to be a great book on passion and lust (of course, this could be due to the manga\u2019s exaggerations). Love is one of those old themes that has been dealt with everywhere \u2013 in poetry & fiction.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Kuzu no Honkai falls into that tradition. I watched the first 4 episodes, the reactions \u2013 and I also skimmed the manga so I roughly know what happens next. I would say that it is a story about people who like to tell themselves that they are the hero or heroine in their story of love. Hanabi Yasuraoka (whose beautiful voice sends shivers down my spine thanks to the atmosphere combined with the work of Chika Anzai) \u2013 believes that her love is important to the point of self-destruction, and she wishes to escape this pain \u2013 either by achieving it or momentarily placing it in someone else. In this case, Awaya Mugi \u2013 a boy who also suffers from the same crisis.\\n\\n\r\nI think the animation is exquisite. And I\u2019m not just talking about the very very hot sex. The slow pacing mingles with the OST and voice to ensure that you don\u2019t just see the events as mere events \u2013 but you feel them as well. You understand that Hanabi is lovestruck because you see the world in her rose-tinted lenses. And when the bouts of depression or loneliness sinks in \u2013 the atmosphere is heavier and anguished.\\n\\n\r\nBut, as I said \u2013 this is the oldest theme. One of the great examinations of Love in any medium has been pulled off by Woody Allen in his film \u2013 Husbands & Wives. In that film \u2013 there are two couples. The first couple has decided they want to \u2018see separate people\u2019 for a while \u2013 the second couple, their friends \u2013 are shocked by the news. The first couple has been happily married for a long time. So, to the second couple, the fact that so many years still cannot guarantee a constant love \u2013 opens up a massive abyss inside them. They, too, find themselves thinking about seeing other people for once. How everything resolves is surprising, maybe even cynical \u2013 and yet completely naturalistic. And Allen\u2019s work is amazing because he never lets his characters find rest in their own story \u2013 but he always takes the observational point of view to make fun of them. To tell them how small their passions are. He uses his trademark comedy sometimes \u2013 or other times he uses very well-placed \u2018documentary footage\u2019 where various of the characters are \u2018interviewed\u2019 after the end of the story.\\n\\n\r\nGonensei is also a good exploration. It deals with the same theme. It is an extremely bitter manga, but at times it is also a romantic one. I have talked about it before in various places. One very good element is the fact that it hides the lead characters\u2019 flaws in the viewpoints and interactions of other characters. It also has some very good use of flashbacks, to show hints of these flaws.\\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai is beautiful \u2013 aesthetically \u2013 but where does it fall? It talks about the stories of these people. It talks about these stories as though they were the most important things in the world to them. But a dream is a dream to the extent that there is always a reality to return to. And although there may be women who, for example, are truly manipulative and find joy only in manipulation \u2013 and it may be \u2018realistic \u2013 there are larger larger things in the world. I am one of those who tries to keep a restraint on this word \u2013 Realistic \u2013 simply because a lot of things can be possible in real life, and to that extent there are many things that can take the moniker of Realism. But there are many people who will be quick to say that something is e.g. \u2018real as fuck\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019s goddamn real as hell\u2019 \u2013 when it is real in the sense that it parallels to the story that they have playing in their own heads. \\n\\n\r\nIn this world of stories \u2013 and in the world where pattern recognition is a constant thing \u2013 you may always have the urge to pull certain thing you see into yourself. This is one of humanity\u2019s oldest weapons. It is called Empathy. But a problem is that Empathy is born from perspective, which may sometimes be limited in its recognition. A happy person will find Hanabi\u2019s struggle to be less \u2018real as hell\u2019 than a person who has \u2018been through it\u2019. The world is large enough to accommodate both perspectives. Furthermore, a person who has \u2018been through it\u2019 and doesn\u2019t want to deal with it anymore may find Kuzu no Honkai \u2018real as hell\u2019 but they won\u2019t enjoy it because they don\u2019t want to deal with that shit anymore. And there are also those people who haven\u2019t been through it but they have pre-conceived angsty notions of people and think that this is how it all works.\\n\\n\r\nTo the extent that we can feel through these characters \u2013 is a limited place to ask questions. Questions like \u2013 is this a good story? Does it say anything powerfully human? There are some writers who are totally unreal in their writing \u2013 but they capture a kind of mood so well that they get to the essence of something human. Kafka is one of them.\\n\\n\r\nWhat are the questions that the characters of Kuzu no Honkai poses towards us? What is the meaning of violent passion? The primary worldview of Kuzu no Honkai seems to be that it is a beautiful net. You are dragged into it, and the world becomes brighter, but underneath \u2013 it is darker. And there are those who do not wish to be caught \u2013 so they become the catcher instead. This is a violent Darwinian kind of perspective where the primary theme is eat or be eaten. The only way to win is not to play. Later events in the ongoing manga seem to support this \u2018escape from passion\u2019 as the only way out. Is it Buddhist? I have no clue. But this violence of passion is the underlying worldview.\\n\\n\r\nBut, therein lies the problem. It is very easy to write of powerful emotions \u2013 and hard to write about an escape from them. To write about powerful emotions, all you have to do is to invoke emotional extremes. War is an emotional extreme. Backstabbing and adultery are emotional extremes. First love is an emotional extreme. Because they are so extreme \u2013 there are bound to be people who find them \u2018real as hell\u2019 \u2013 because we remember our extremes the clearest, while forgetting that our life is built from these extremes and a thousand other smaller thoughts. A writer with more restraint always finds a way to be gentler, subtler, and more analytical in their treatment of a theme. You can look to Woody Allen\u2019s Manhattan \u2013 for example \u2013 where all these passions and emotions play a part in the work, but it also serves to expand upon the theme of a single person\u2019s idealization of his own life. His idealization of a city and of romantic ambitions. The story he is trapped in and cannot escape from.\\n\\n\r\nTo that extent, Kuzu no Honkai is better as a whirlpool for you to be trapped in. It\u2019s a wave of emotion that just keeps on coming, and it uses all the power of Shoujo romantic art to maximize on the force. But, I think a good story has to show you the waves, and then provide you with a shore to stand on \u2013 to look at the sun.\\n",

            "content": "Love and the sexual feelings we have, lust, are complicated and confusing. Much like my overall thoughts on this anime...\r\nScum's Wish was the  break out hit this season with conflicting opinions all over the place from people praising the show as a masterpiece in which it conveys the themes of romance and love in a realistic manner and those who say that it is over glorified and unrealistic. If you were to ask me, I'd say this anime is pretty stupid, and for the longest time I couldn't decided what this anime was going for exactly nor of what to make of it! Ithonestly feels like, in a lot of places, it is the second coming of School Days!\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem I had with this show was its lack of any interesting characters at all, but before I get into that, let's discuss the plot for this show:\\n\r\nScum's Wish may seem like your typical romance show, but the two main characters who are in a relationship with each other, in fact, do not love each other at all, and lust for different people. Hanabi loves her Onii-chan and Mugi loves his sensei. As the show goes along the two characters begin to bond together, as they begin to form a real relationship whilst trying to come to grips with their unrequited love, while, at the same time, being horrible, scummy people sleeping around with others and using others to get closer to what they want. The characters constantly fuck each other other (no sexual pun intended.) And that's the main aim of this show; to highlight and showcase people at their absolute worst, who do nothing but sleep around and use people for their own agenda's and goals, but here lies my biggest gripe with the show. I find it so boring.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot does try to do something different, which is commendable in its own right, I found everything to be so lacklustre despite the numerous, and rather off-putting sex scenes in the show. I would go as far as to call this show a deconstruction but not a very good one since I don't care at all with what is happening with any of the characters since the anime hasn't given me any reason to care for any of them from the start. All of them are pretty much horrible, disgusting people, and I do get that this is the appeal of the show for some, to watch horrible bastards instead of your typical sugar coated anime girls, but at the same time, since the characters are so unlikable and boring, I found their struggles and problems to be entirely pointless! The characters go around in circles and often the scenarios feel forced and often rather trite at times as well! Not only that but this show is filled to the brim of emotional monologues which always came across as being pretentious in my eyes and a cheap way of sounding deep without trying to convey any themes or ideas in a convincing manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty stupid, and end up doing stupid things just to force drama and pad out the episodes. Now, I understand that teenagers do stupid things all of the time, so it would make sense for them to do stupid things, but the amount of times I became annoyed with this show, and face palmed is staggering since there is no catharsis pay off to make light of the dumb decisions they make, and again, I couldn't find investment since the cast was rather dull and one dimensional. The show does present lesbians and bisexuality as well and attempts to present these in a realistic manner, but since not enough time is invested in these ideas they instead feel rather lackluster and are pushed to the side, remaining stagnant with hardly any development. \\n\\n\r\nI've seen some people refer to this anime as being realistic, and while I can't speak for anyone, this, to me, it perhaps one of the most unrealistic romance shows to ever grace the Earth. All of the drama feels rather forced and thus the characters do too. Also, when in real life have you seen a girl lusting after her own brother so badly before? Not in my world anyway...\\n\r\nTo be perfectly fair, they do treat the incest subtext matter with some care and respect and it isn't just reduced to being just some fan service for all of the filthy weebs out there and hell, it even gets a decent amount of development to fuel her love, making it somewhat justified, although it isn't handled nowhere as good as something like Koi Kaze.\\n\\n\r\nEach character also makes it a habit of referring as themselves as awful people, which, while acknowledging the fact that they're, it doesn't change them at all, nor makes them inherently interesting because of this. The show really needed a likable character to latch onto, or someone to care for in order to have made the drama more hard hitting, but what we get is a rather dull, and confusing mess without any sense of direction to go in terms of its characters or story. The whole time while I was watching the show, I just felt uncomfortable and the whole show feels trashy, hiding behind the disguise of an emotional drama. It honestly does feel just like School Days in many regards. Now, I'm not someone who thinks School Days was the worst anime of all time, far from it in fact, but it attempts to do the same thing as Scum's Wish - that being a deconstruction of the harem/romance genre while presenting drama and dirt bag characters, and it suffers from the same problem. Since the characters are only presented as being such, it's hard to latch onto them and feel for anything they go through since the show is nothing more than a deconstruction and believes that is enough by itself to carry the show, which it isn't at all. At the very least we get to see all of the cunts die at the end of School Days...if only that would've happened here. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I have to say, Scum's Wish has a great visual aesthetic, with great character designs and even some experimental animation to convey the emotional instability the characters are feeling, and the sex scenes, while awkward to watch since they hardly add anything onto the characters, are well very well animated; as well as the music. The opening theme was great and there is a great variety of music in the show to fit the correct moods, definitely the strong points of the show. The voice actors also do a pretty great job at conveying the emotions of their characters and they do feel pretty convincing as well. I also liked the rectangular boxes that would appear on the screen that cut to close-ups of the characters faces which was a subtle touch at presenting their emotions without relying on forced exposition, and this was a nice addition in terms of visual appeal. \\n\\n\r\nBut, when it comes down to it, if we strip these elements all we have is a boring deconstruction with pretentious excuses for deep characters. I do appreciate that the show is trying to do something different, but sometimes, different is not always better. I honestly really wanted to like Scum's Wish, I really did, but the lack of any interesting characters combine that with the fact that I hated every second of it, makes me never want to touch this anime ever again.",

            "content": "There aren't many anime as uncomfortable as Kuzu no Honkai. It introduces itself as a melancholic tale of unrequited love, and quickly transforms into something far more ugly. The characters are relentlessly trampled upon, until, indeed, as the title might suggest, they are reduced to human trash. \r\nIt isn't necessary for a story to make you feel happy. There exist a wealth of fiction that, while depressing, and perhaps never even enjoyable, are still valuable for the message they are trying to make. \r\nKuzu no Honkai doesn't have that message. It is misery for misery's sake, existing almost exclusively to make you feel like crap.If you found anime such as Aku no Hana and School Days difficult to watch, you might have yourself something of a challenge here, too. \\n\\n\r\nThere is seldom a character within Kuzu no Honkai who behaves sensibly or is capable of thinking with any other organ except their genitalia. Hanabi and Mugi are lonely because they cannot be united with their loved ones, and so they seek to find some solace in each other. They can't love each other because they love someone else. They use sexual intimacy as an escape. But they still can't give up on the one they love. And so the cycle, their tedious lives continue.\\n\\n\r\nIf that is where the series stood, all may have been fine. But it escalates, and they, and just about everyone else surrounding them, wants more, more, until nothing remains in their hollow lives but sex and sleaze. It becomes impossible to feel any empathy for them and the grief they are constantly plunging themselves into. They're beyond saving. They deserve everything that happens to them. And so I cannot bring myself to care when it tries to play Hanabi as the victim, the tragic heroine. The real victims are Norumi (the male teacher) and Noriko for being deceived by such deplorable people. Love is blind, as the cheesy proverb goes, but in this case they must also be blind in the literal sense. \\n\\n\r\nMost of Kuzu no Honkai's cast is comprised of hypocrites who get upset with their partner(s) for acts they have been committing themselves. They act nonsensically at times, and can change their attitude on a whim, giving up on their love at the end of one episode and then cheerfully encouraging each other to confess at the beginning of the next. They haven't the slightest idea of what they want. Maybe that is to be expected. Love is a tricky thing, after all, and teenagers are at their most confused stage in life. But it becomes a question if what they felt was ever love in the first place when they can so readily find someone else as a replacement, sleeping with anyone who shows them even the slightest affection. It's entirely possible that Hanabi and Mugi only fell in love with their respective partner because they were the first ones to give them that affection. And so how am I to feel bad for the two when their crushes end in disappointment? \\n\\n\r\nWhile women like Akane undoubtedly exist in the real world (having unfortunately encountered someone similar myself), she is possessed by such an intensely twisted and ugly worldview that it becomes a wonder how she is even able to fulfil her duties as a teacher. She eventually comes to a point of redemption, but makes it quite clear that she is there only to see, to try, potentially ruining a man's entire life merely for the chance of relieving her boredom. I didn't find that heartwarming as it was intended to be - I found it disgusting of her, and that's in the face of all the detestable things she had already done. \\n\\n\r\nThe main theme of each episode is who is going to make out with or bang whom. It's an endless rotation, much like a hentai, the characters seemingly unaware of or passive to the concept of cheating, and incapable of guilt. Everyone loves someone else, and seemingly nobody in the world is capable of a happy, fulfilling relationship-- even Hanabi's friends (who are never otherwise shown) are revealed as having their partner cheating on them. Maybe it's a good thing I detest all the characters, as I don't think I would want a character I actually like to be in a story like this. Any time Noriko appeared, the one I disliked the least, I was dreading to see the mess she might be dragged into. And Narumi, while naive to painful extents, is never really deserving of the awful situation Akane puts him through. The only joy you could possibly extract from something like this is some sadomasochistic desire to see everyone in pain and despair. I can't say I possess that desire.\\n\\n\r\nThe main rebuttal, I would imagine, is that the characters are meant to be human trash, and so it is okay that they are trash. I could concede to that point, as stories do not require respectable characters. But even trash are human, and so it is expected that they still behave like humans, a detail that Kuzu no Honkai seems so ready to forget. \\n\\n\r\nSanae, for instance, has such an intense (and frankly creepy) attachment to her loved one that it almost seems a crime for her to not be locked away in some mental hospital. There can at times be a desire to stay with someone you love even when you know you cannot have them or that they are bad for you, but she long crosses the boundary of how real people would react in her situation. There is a difference between being a confused teenager who seeks sexual gratification, and being a psychotic almost-rapist who believes people are their property. If they have done as she does, then they've probably gotten to know prison life pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nIt's also questionable why the author decided to complicate things further by giving Sanae someone who one-sidedly loves her as well, considering how little is ever done with them. You could write them out completely and it wouldn't affect much of anything. They exist solely, I would assume, to create more despair, as if the show hadn't enough of that already. \\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai's detestable cast is, if nothing else, well-realised, thanks to the frequent monologuing and backstories. Each of the main six get their turn to narrate on numerous occasions, which does well to explain their motivations and feelings and to make them feel like proper protagonists rather than mere accessories to the carnage, even if some (namely Sanae) receive significantly less characterisation than others. To merely show two characters having sex or making out with each other is not nearly as meaningful as when it is accompanied by narration. It leaves less to the imagination, but, unlike other intensely uncomfortable and cringe-filled anime such as School Days, gives substance to the scene and makes sense in the context of the characters. When timed with the anime's emotional soundtrack, some of the dialogue can almost feel captivating, and a kiss can carry power, even if it is between two people who really have no business kissing each other in the first place. It's nice to have an anime courageous enough to portray sex in an honest manner, as most use it purely for pornographic purposes, or seem afraid of touching upon it altogether, as if humans are somehow sexless creatures. I just don't think that real people are nearly as defined by it as they are in Kuzu no Honkai. \\n\\n\r\nI'll fully admit that I hated every second I spent watching Kuzu no Honkai, and felt relieved when it was over. This isn't because it is a particularly bad anime, but because it aims to say or do little else but make the viewer feel terrible. It pushes you, kicks you, and then throws another punch to your gut once that is over. It is filled with moments where you want to shout at the characters to stop, to not be stupid. There are times where you will have to pause and take a breather because of all the cringe and madness that is unfolding. Kuzu no Honkai is about as far from a pleasant anime as can possibly be, and it never really aims to fill that gap with much substance or meaning. Its starting and ending points are the same. It wants to say that people are stupid, that love hurts, and more than that, it wants you to hurt, too. \\n\\n\r\nSome people will be fine with that. Maybe they want to feel awful. Maybe they just want to feel emotion, any emotion.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give them that - it certainly makes you feel something.",

Unfortunately for Hanabi and Mugi their love is not reciprocal. \r\nForgive me for any grammar errors, i'm not used to write in english\r\nStory: 10\r\nThis is not an usual romance anime. This anime is very original, and in a certain way, unique. There are unforeseeable events and the story grows perfectly.\r\nArt: 10\r\nPerfect, detailed, stunning.\r\nSound: 10\r\nThe opening \"Uso no Hibana\" is a masterpiece, and theending \"Heikousen\" even better.

However 4 episodes isn't a lot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI'm really enjoying this anime, as you probably noticed in the course of this review english is not my main language. Even so i'm watching this anime with english subtitles so i can watch this earlier (it takes time to translate into portuguese). This anime is very fun to watch, so absolutely recommend it if you enjoy a deeper and darker romance. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nIt really touched me in a personal level and caught my attention, characters look like real persons, original story and pretty enjoyable at all.\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\nEDIT 17/02/17 (Episode 6)\\n\r\n Pretty minor spoilers here\\n\\n\r\nArt: Same\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n Well, as i said before this is an unique anime romance story, if you have seen any romance anime with a similar story just let me know, because until now i know none. Two weeks ago i said that this story is full of unforseeable events, i was not wrong. I have seen much anime, maybe not as much as 50% of you but thruth be told 50 days IS a lot (and i cant remember the name of every single anime i saw), stay, i never saw anything like this in ANIME, you can find similar manga and pretty similar american TV series but there's not a single anime with this premisse, and if there is as i said before, just let me know, like, please.\\n\r\n Ok the story is original, but is it good? It is a well-developed story, you \\n\r\nprobably already had that feeling when the story is going to absolutely nowhere, you wont have that feeling watching this. And please, do not say that there is fanservice, if you see Kuzu No Honkai sex scenes as fanserive you are probably a sadistic. Sex in Kuzu no Honkai is DRAMA. Am i going to get horny? Yes you'll, but you wont feel good for this. Sounds strange? Yea that is why this is Story is fabolous IF you are mature enought to understand what is going on so i still with my 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Same\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8.75\\n\r\nI said before that Akane was bothering me, not anymore. She got humanized.\\n\r\nSome people might disagree me, and i cant explain why because it'd be spoiler so i'll explain why i do think she got \"humanized\". She got drunk and said shit. That's pretty normal for and adult, she is not an agel or a demon she is a person like you and me. \\n\r\nAnd we still have pretty complex characters like Mugi, Hanabi and Sanae. \\n\r\nWhy i cant give this a 10? \\n\r\nWell basically 2 reasons\\n\r\n1 I've seen better.\\n\r\n2 A character like Moca have only one purpose, to suffer. She worked hard her whole life in order to Mugi notice her, and what she gets? Nothing, well nothing actually would be better, she gets suffering. As i said before there's a uforeseeable story but still i cant imagine Moca being happy.\\n\\n\\n\r\n,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "My Opinion: \r\nDid \u201cSchool Days\u201d get a second season? Oh, no, it\u2019s Kuzu no Honkai, also known as one of the most popular and overrated anime series of winter 2017.\r\nKuzu no Honkai is an exaggeration of the love life experienced by high school students and watching it reminded me of a National Geographic documentary about mating rabbits I saw years ago.\r\nWhile the show had some very good ideas, it failed in executing them, fact which made the show look more like a trainwreck rather than the \u201cin-depth, mature\u201d series it intended to be. \r\nThe plot is inconsistent and poorly executed for the most part employingcliche ideas, cringe worthy scenes, predictable twists and unnatural actions. \\n\r\nThe character cast in itself is poorly constructed and consists mostly of generic tropes that are shallow and one-dimensional, but the inter-relations between them were surprisingly well-done.\\n\r\nNowadays, shows that feature adolescents thinking about and doing the dirty is considered to be mature and \u201cin-depth\u201d... To be honest, Kuzu no Honkay is your generic drama TV series that got animated, nothing more and nothing special.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nThe story revolves around the love life of two high school students, Hanabi Yasuraoka and Mugi Awaya.\\n\r\nHigh school students Mugi Awaya and Hanabi Yasuraoka appear to be the ideal couple, they are both pretty and popular, and they seem to suit each other well. However, outsiders don't know of the secret they share, both Mugi and Hanabi have hopeless crushes on someone else and they are only dating each other to soothe their loneliness. \\n\r\nHanabi has been in love for a long time with her older childhood friend Narumi Kanaiwho who is now her homeroom teacher, and Mugi is in love with his slightly older former tutor Akane Minagawa who is now a music teacher at his school.\\n\r\nIn each other, they find a place where they can grieve for the ones they cannot have and they share physical and emotional intimacy driven by loneliness. This begins their romantic relationship as both of them predictably fall for each other as the story unfolds.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is character-driven, linear and fairly unique but predictable, it progresses with the characters at a good pace, showing their inner thoughts and development as well as portraying their dilemmas and questions about love.\\n\r\nThemes such as \u201cforbidden love\u201d, \u201cfriendship\u201d, \u201cmaturity\u201d, \u201csex, lies and betrayal\u201d are approached by this show and some of them are fairly well executed while some of them are not. \\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai explores sexuality from the interesting yet juvenile perspective of high school students. Unfortunately, what could have been a great enlightening experience turned into a revolting experience consisting of watching people as they take some really dumb and weird sexual actions with no clear purpose other than satisfying their primitive needs.\\n\r\nThis anime touches the sensitive feelings and problems that most young people go through when they find real love/romance or fake love/romance that they don\u2019t know how to deal with and the problems those feelings can lead to. While I commend the show for taking such an unusual path I cannot ignore the poor manner in which it was executed.\\n\r\nI wish the show would have focused much more on the moral and emotional implications of these love acts, showing and thoroughly analyzing the psych of the characters rather than focusing on poor-taste sex scenes that seemed forced, but that\u2019s just my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai is the definition of a pretentious show because the main theme is \u201cI\u2019m 17 and I\u2019m deep\u201d and the show expects to be treated as a mature and profound romance series.\\n\r\nAlthough Kuzu no Honkai has those ambitions, it miserably fails at being mature and rather comes off as pseudo-mature. A bunch of junior high school students try to compensate for their desires, insecurities and unrequited sentiments through ludicrous acts like pointlessly having sex in order to \u201cfill their emptiness\u201d. Is that the best they could come up with? \\n\r\nAlso, recall the villainous slutty music teacher who screws around saying she \u201cexploits\u201d men, that is so profound.... I failed to see the \u201cmaturity\u201d and \u201cprofoundness\u201d of this show.\\n\\n\r\nScum\u2019s Wish tried so hard to be complex to the point the script became an utter mess.\\n\r\nWhy I say that?\\n\r\nHanabi loves Kanai, Mugi loves Akane but Hanabi and Mugi are together, and Akane and Kanai are together, Moca loves Mugi and Ecchan loves Hanabi and now Hanabi starts to fall for Mugi. \\n\r\nI say it is too complex for its own good, it seems like a clusterfuck of a situation more than anything else and to be honest, it\u2019s dumb and pathetic to see a show try so hard and fail just as hard.\\n\\n\r\nThe \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d scenario is as cliche as it can get and makes the plot so much more predictable. This scenario consists of the generic course of action where two people decide to have sex on a regular basis and promise to never fall in love with each other and later on they always end up falling in love with each other. \\n\r\nAs predicted, after Hanabi and Mugi started having sex they started developing feelings for each other and later on in the show, Hanabi decides to \u201ctry to love Mugi\u201d, predictable.\\n\r\nI guess the creator watched one of those cliche movies like \u201cFriends With Benefits\u201d or \u201cNo Strings Attached\u201d and decided to do a perverted and twisted animated version of them.\\n\\n\r\nIn a sense, Kuzu no Honkai is a jumble of realistic scenarios and life problems which I really enjoyed. It portrays questions and situations some people  faced in their youth and could relate to, such as:\\n\r\n\u201cIf I could have things work out with him\u2026 I\u2019d do it in a heartbeat\u201d - which is very much true, the only thing you want when you are in love is to be with the one you love but sometimes you don\u2019t have the \u201ccourage\u201d to take the first step towards that goal and that is unfortunate.\\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I should choose the older man or the athletic student\u201d - also a problem that a lot of women face when they have the option of choosing between money and social security represented by the \u201dolder man\u201d or looks represented by the \u201cathletic student\u201d, in the end, neither choice is based on the feeling of \u201clove\u201d but it is rather based on the feeling of lust or the need to feel secure. \\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what is the diffrence between love and lust anymore\u201d - a question that confuses many teenagers but has a rather simple answer.\\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I like them both so much it hurts but making the choice is a pain\u201d - also a real problem many people face before entering a relationship just for the sake of doing it because they had nothing better in mind. \\n\r\n\u201cIt was love at first sight\u201d - as the line says, this \u201clove\u201d can only be based on physical appearances therefore it is superficial and should be called lust.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like is that Kuzu no Honkai is an open-minded show in which love has no bounds. Be it student-teacher, lesbianism, incest or childhood friends, nothing will stop the characters from having sexual intercourse based on a moment\u2019s decision.\\n\r\nThe idea of exploring same-gender love was actually great, after all, that is what Kuzu no Honkai is supposed to do, but the execution of it was terrible and resulted in a girl-to-girl scenario that was wrong, out of place and furthermore damaged the show.\\n\r\nAfter seeing Hanabi willingly have \u201csex\u201d with a female friend after being rejected, I was left pondering that course of action and questioned the creator\u2019s knowledge of the female mind, therefore I proceeded in asking multiple young female friends if they would have sex with a person of the same gender, given the context of being \u201cheartbroken\u201d. The answer was an unanimous \u201cno\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters seem damaged on a fundamental level, desperately wanting the attention of their loved ones, fact which I could not understand.\\n\r\nHanabi is obsessed over her \u201conii-chan\u201d to the point that what she feels is not called \u201clove\u201d but \u201clust\u201d. It is not normal to fantasize about your crush to the point where you have sex with another person while pretending that person is your crush. \\n\\n\r\nI find this \u201cunrequited\u201d love situation grossly exaggerated and forced because it doesn\u2019t follow a natural flow and it is very far from being realistic. \\n\r\nFor the sake of the plot, these characters have no common sense, instead of confessing their \u201clove\u201d or silently await the right moment to take the initiative, they decide to screw around and play house with no worries about the consequences of their actions or their future.\\n\r\nWhen I was in highschool my first and foremost priority was studying in order to pass the university entrance exam, not fooling around and whining about being lonely. \\n\r\nI know I shouldn\u2019t compare anime to real life, but they made the show in a high school setting because they wanted people to relate to it and how am I supposed to relate to such exaggerated, unnatural and hard to believe love problems?\\n\\n\r\nAnother important writing screw-up made by the creator was changing the fundamental traits of the characters in very short periods of time, referring to Noriko and Akane.\\n\r\nNoriko is an innocent girl who has built her life around the idea that she is a princess and only thinks about marrying her \u201cprince\u201d and live happily ever after, an innocent girl who suddenly wants to have sex with the prince, basically a \u201cprincess\u201d turned into a lusty and deplorable girl in the matter of a few minutes\u2026\\n\r\nAkane, a despicable women who screws around seeking any man\u2019s attention and other women\u2019s jealousy. This woman that is damaged on a fundamental level suddenly changes as Narumi, the \u201cknight in shining armor\u201d touches her soul. It is not only cliche but also unreal, for a woman who only considers men as warm bodies, distractions from a mundane life and basically sleeps with anyone she meets to be changed so easily. Poor judgement on the writer\u2019s part. \\n\r\nThere was a saying, \u201cyou can\u2019t change a whore into a housewife\u201d and that perfectly applies to Akane\u2019s situation. From all the lack of judgement on the creator\u2019s part I was able to notice a life lesson: If you are pretty, everything is forgiven. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing that bothered me were the imbecilic lines such as: \u201cI want you to be filled with me\u201d; \u201cGetting a man to fall for you is easy\u201d, \u201cIt doesn't matter if we are cousins, I\u2019ll never give up\u201d; \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stop seeing other men\u201d, etc. and the forced, cringe-worthy scenes when Hanabi was giving a handjob to Mugi, a bunch of idiotic scenes about Akane, etc. \\n\r\nAt least I sometimes laughed at how stupid some of the lines and scenes were...\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThe characters on their own are nothing special, they are mostly self-centered tropes and quite despicable characters that are difficult to relate to or like, but when they are looked at as a whole, it\u2019s a different situation. Almost forgot, there is no character development except for Hanabi and Akane.\\n\r\nWhat I found interesting is the true strength of Kuzu no Honkai that lies in the character interactions, this show has some amazing relationship development.\\n\\n\r\nHanabi Yasuraoka, she is a high school student who is in love with her older childhood friend, Narumi who is her homeroom teacher. After finding out that Narumi is in love with another woman, Hanabi enters a \u201cfake\u201d relationship with Mugi to satisfy her loneliness but soon after she has physical relations with Mugi, she realizes her feelings towards him, and as the story unfolds her character undergoes multiple changes.\\n\r\nAt first, Hanabi is portrayed as a innocent girl but after she begins her relationship with Mugi she becomes confused and doesn\u2019t know what she is feeling and what she is supposed to feel, as she states, \u201cI can\u2019t even tell the difference between love and lust anymore\u201d. \\n\r\nAfter finding out that Narumi had sex with Akane, Hanabi decides to \u201csteal\u201d everyone that is under Akane\u2019s \u201cspell\u201d by having sex with them. Fortunately enough, after dating one of Akane\u2019s boytoys, Hanabi realizes that lowering herself to Akane\u2019s level is not the answer to her predicament and hateful emotions, therefore she stops deluding herself by thinking she can beat Akane at her own game. Soon after that, Hanabi begins to isolate herself from Mugi and starts thinking of herself as a \u201cweak\u201d person and a \u201ccoward\u201d, having no \u201cself-worth\u201d, this is a difficult time for Hanabi because she feels defeated and inferior to Akane. \\n\r\nAs the story progresses, Hanabi slowly recovers from that depressive state of mind and fulfilling a promise she made to Mugi, Hanabi confesses her love to Narumi and gets rejected, event that sets Hanabi free and makes her feel like she can have a fresh start at life.\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Hanabi goes from being a normal girl to lowering herself near to the level of a \u201cslut\u201d but she soon recovers from that downfall and starts to feel miserable about herself only to later regain a healthy way of thinking and decide to stop ignoring her feelings towards Mugi.\\n\r\nMy thoughts on her character: Hanabi just wants true love but doesn\u2019t know how to lover herself, yet.\\n\\n\r\nMugi Awaya, he is a high school student who is in love with his former tutor, Akane. He and Hanabi begin a fake \u201crelationship\u201d to satisfy each other's desires. In middle school, Mugi had already been in a \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d relationship with his senior, Mei Hayakawa, who took his virginity.\\n\r\nMugi is not a dense man but rather clever and observant, he is one of the only men who realized what type of woman Akane really was, he had always been aware of the kind of person Akane was, but loved her nevertheless. \\n\r\nMugi is reluctant to admit his true emotions towards Hanabi because he already had that kind of \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d relation, he fell in love with that person and ended up heartbroken because the relationship had to end. He is still afraid of being close to someone, point that is proved in the scenes where he asked for sexual favors then suddenly stopped as if it was a bad idea, which is synonymous with him wanting to try being in a relationship again but being scared of the rejection he once experienced.\\n\r\nAt the end of the series, after he had sex with Akane on multiple occasions, trying to change the way she was, he realizes he doesn\u2019t love Akane anymore so he bids goodbye to her.\\n\\n\r\nNarumi Kanai is Hanabi\u2019s homeroom teacher and older childhood friend.\\n\r\nNarumi is the generic and cliche type of man who is kind, shy, mellow, forgiving, etc. \\n\r\nHe is in a relationship with Akane even though he knows she is a \u201cslut\u201d and completely forgives her for it, telling her she \u201cdoesn\u2019t need to stop seeing other men\u201d because he loves her enough to accept that part of her.\\n\r\nEven after knowing Akane's true nature, Narumi does not seem to mind and asks her to marry him, which she accepts. Bleh, cliche.\\n\r\nMy opinion on his character: He is just an emasculated guy who plays the role of the knight in shining armor that saves Akane from herself. More and  I\u2019m gonna throw up.\\n\\n\r\nAkane Minagawa, on the outside, she is a nice, well-behaved woman who is adored by her students, but she actually loves the feeling of winning a man's heart while directly hurting someone else who is in love with that man. She can also be considered a lonely person and a nymphomaniac. \\n\r\nAkane attempts to seduce Narumi like her previous relationships, but she notices that Narumi refrains from touching her, unlike the men in her past, later realizing that he truly loves her. After Narumi asks her to marry him despite of knowing her true nature, Akane begins to take interest in him and suddenly decides to change her ways. Bleh, cliche.\\n\r\nMy opinion on her character: This depraved woman thinks she is \u201cexploiting\u201d men when she has sex with them but actually she is the one being used and \u201cexploited\u201d, what a pathetic and disgusting state she is in.\\n\r\nI have a saying that fits this like a glove: \u201cA key that can open many locks is called a master key, but a lock that can be opened by many keys is a shitty lock.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters that are just empty tropes, particularly Sanae Ebato who is the lesbian girl who forced herself on Hanabi, and Noriko Kamomebata who is a deluded \u201cloli\u201d girl that considers herself a princess and dreams of marrying her \u201cprince\u201d, Mugi. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the strong point of Kuzu no Honkai are the character interactions, which I\u2019ve basically described in the paragraphs above, no need in doing it again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful with surprisingly good character designs, working with a well-chosen color palette that gives a somber tone. The animation is fluid, nothing to complain about other than a few small flaws and the overuse of \u201chidden eyes\u201d, which are used when they want the characters to reflect a deep emotion.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme were well-suited for the show, not only being pleasant to hear but also having some symbolism and offering a drama tone. The OST was well-chosen as well, it offers an immersive experience and facilitates the potential flow of emotions coming from the show. The voice actors did a very good job interpreting the characters and their emotions but there were some exceptions to the rule.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI am inclined to say that I enjoyed the show despite its numerous flaws.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nThe show has failed in many categories but I think it does a fairly good job at showing how cruel love can be. If you are looking for a romance show that is slightly different form the generic \u201cboy meets girl\u201d scenario, give Kuzu no Honkai a shot.",

            "content": "When someone considers themselves or others to be connoisseurs of any storytelling media, there are specific prerequisites expected from that individual that's usually understood without the need to outright state it. These factors can include being well-versed with different genres within the medium in question, to more demanding things, like understanding the construct in which the medium expresses its ideas. But out of all these unspoken base requirements, I think the most important one is something that's usually acknowledged but often taken for granted. That something in question is a hands-on understanding of the subject matter itself. \r\nWithout that attribute, an exhausted catalog ofliterary knowledge and understanding of narrative tools is rendered almost pointless. Being book smart amounts to nothing without practical experience, or at the very least, first-hand encounters. Think of it this way, knowing about an archetype or trope is only as valuable as understanding what worldly influence caused it to exist, to begin with. Anyone can comprehend a creator's intent all day, but without an inkling of relation to it, all diegetic information could only be taken for what it is at face value. \\n\\n\r\nNow, with that in mind, it's time to take a quick litmus test; ladies and gentlemen, Kuzu no Honkai (Scum's Wish) is average.\\n\\n\r\nQuickly, what was your initial thought after reading that statement? Did you think that was an outlandish claim to make? That Scum's Wish is far from average and that the claim made was purposefully contrarian or, for the lack of a better word, attention-seeking? How can an anime that explore sexual decadents with such unfiltered restraint be considered \"average\" by any means? Most relationship anime don't even get past first base, so how can that claim be justified? \\n\\n\r\nIf you've already come to a similar conclusion regarding Scum's Wish before reading my statement, bear with me, as for everyone else that possibly rattled off something similar to the aforementioned thought process, time to explain why. \\n\\n\r\nOne Tree Hill, Gossip Girl, The O.C, Dawson's Creek, 90210, Pretty Little Liars, Gilmore Girls; what do these live-action TV shows have in common? Well, for one, they're centered around teens or young adults dealing with relationship drama in very exaggerated ways. And secondly, and perhaps more important as well, they're usually understood by most astute viewers to be conventional television programming. No critical thinker or demanding viewer worth their salt is singing high praises about these shows. The reason why is pretty simple, apart from being well-cultured in several different mediums that is. The discernment for shows of this ilk ties back to that essential requirement I mentioned: having hands-on experience. \\n\\n\r\nIf your firsthand encounter with the drama Scum's Wish wraps itself up in is close to none, praising it becomes easy to do. However, if you've ever been involved in any relationship, where you and the party in question were mutually in it for sexual gratification, then what Scum's Wish tries to depict gradually gets more juvenile and diluted with each passing episode. Anyone of the bottled off sexual/sensual encounters it indulges in can be believable on its own, but when meshed together to the degree in which every single character in immediate circles in the show is involved in a daisy chain of intimate depravity\u2014at that point, it becomes wholly unrealistic; almost approaching the point of midday soap opera levels of contrived. This is sensationalized TV drama 101; the quintessential reason for why the phrase \"sex sells\" remain relevant for mainstay media.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, Scum's Wish is an animated version of your typical live-action teen/young adult drama TV show.    \\n\\n\r\nNow, before we go on any further, let's make this clear, teen/young adult drama shows themselves aren't inherently devoid of substance. There are live-action TV shows like Friday Night Lights and My So-Called Life, and even animated titles such as Nana and Beck that receive widespread critical acclaim for the same kind of things depicted in Scum's Wish. But instead of sensationalizing the subject matter for the sake of capturing audience attention, those shows decide to represent the relationships of the characters in naturalistic ways. The key takeaway here is that those shows did NOT rely on sensationalizing its content. That's the difference between media that use sex in an exploitative manner, and those that incorporate it as just another facet of life in the narrative at hand. Having relatable scenarios don't amount to much if it's unrealistically presented in the confines of the story. The show takes itself seriously, but the situations themselves are vapid at best. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that isn't even to say that theatrically sensationalized programming doesn't have its place in storytelling media either.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no shortage of TV shows that use sensationalism to its advantage; such is the case with TV series like Shameless. A show that purposefully acknowledges the fact that it's all about sex, violence, drugs, and mayhem. And if the namesake didn't already make that clear enough, it \"shamelessly\" uses these aspects to tell its story. But that's the difference between something that's purposely sleazy like Shameless and the likes of Scum's Wish. One show is self-aware of its overblown content while the other operates with an aura of conceit and pretension.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough with the long-winded preamble, let's discuss what the show is all about. Short answer: yearning for others and sexual depravity. Long answer:\\n\\n\r\nFor as long as she could remember, Hanabi \"Hana\" Ysuraoka has been infatuated with her neighbor, Narumi Kanai. Due to their single parent upbringing, from a young age, they had quickly established a sort of family bond with each other, with Narumi becoming a frequent guest in Hanabi's household, to the point where she refers to him as her \"big brother.\" Eventually, this infatuation Hanabi shares for Narumi slowly turn into a romantic interest. And as is the case with any story scenario of this nature, that love goes unnoticed as Narumi has his eyes set on someone else. That someone being the alluring music teacher and predestined rival, Akane Minagawa. \\n\r\nBeing the object of affection to any guy that attends Hanabi's high school, Akane has no shortage of men fawning over her at any given time. With her strawberry blonde hair, alluring smile, and an aura that just permeates femininity, Narumi became yet another lovestruck male caught up in her presence. \\n\\n\r\nWith Akane and Narumi both being teachers, Hanabi's standing as a student further widens the gap between her and the one she loves, as she watches with each interaction they share slowly chipping away at her chances of ever having him to herself. Left in a state of emotional limbo, unable to do anything but watch as he gradually slips further out of reach; it's here, in this place of solitude that she finds out that she's not alone. A pair of eyes fixated with a familiar saddened gaze reflected in them stare at the cheerful adults as well. His name, Mugi Awaya. She may not know him personally, but that familiar bitter tinge of unrequited love that they mutually share leaves her a small glimmer of reassurance\u2014\"I don't have to suffer this alone.\" And so a pact is made by the pair, one signed with only physical comfort in mind. Sexual relief, mutual resentment, a promise of no strings attached; emotions left harbored off from each other for that promised day. Friends with benefits with only one intent in mind, to eventually gain the affection of the person they truly yearn for. \\n\\n\r\nA tragic, bittersweet, ill-fated romance. A setup that could take on so many avenues of exploration and be successful at all of them if done right. It doesn't have to do much, just simply show the consequence of that kind of entangled emotional dependence as it affects the characters involved. Anything that toxic and shortsighted is bound to cause psychological scarring to anyone that participates. A dangerous game that some of us may have personally felt the backlash for at some point in our lives, after foolishly thinking that we were above the consequences. That somehow the end-result that many faced before wouldn't apply to us. A foolhardy belief that we could handle it where others weren't capable. \\n\r\nA continuous physical/sexual dependence on others will always come with a steep price of admission, whether it's immediately realized or comes on later in life during a silent night laying in bed, as thoughts of it creep in, festering in your idle mind. The foolishness of our now bruised ego, as we reflect on the stupid decisions of our past selves. Hubris in its purest form, with humility being the bitter pill we're made to swallow.   \\n\\n\r\nAnd to the show's credit, it does a good enough job depicting that inevitability. The problem is that it doesn't just stop there, as it decides to go the whole nine yards, and then some. Instead of just settling with a believable depiction to carry this core message, Scum's Wish is too greedy to call it quits. It doesn't just want to depict that scenario; it wants to portray everything under the sun, exhausting every possible love/lust situation imaginable in an attempt to make every possible outcome into an attention-seeking circus act of sexual decadents. And it's because of this, what once started out as a reasonably believable scenario, has now been turned into a ludicrously overblown orgy fest.\\n\\n\r\nWithout getting into specific names or details, I'm going to describe the general plotting of this show. And no, I'm not exaggerating here, this is what truly happens:\\n\\n\r\nPerson A wants to be with person B, but person B wants to be with person C, and person C only desire attention, and person D wants to be with person C but settled for person A, while person E wants to be with person D, and person F wants to be with person A, and person G wants to be with person F, and person H wants to be with anyone who's willing, and person C uses person H, while person D uses person E, while person J and D use each other, and person A uses person F, and person H tries to use person A... and so on and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nAnd again, this isn't an exaggeration, this is what actually happens when you sit down to map out the plot for each episode. To say this story is insanely contrived would be an understatement. There are shows with fatalism in it that manage to feel less artificial. Any character that's recurring or has a name in this story is actively trying to bone each other.\\n\\n\r\nThere is absolutely nothing realistic about this toxic nonagonal love-web. And it's this web that actively defeats any victory laps the show achieves with any one of the individual stories stuck inside it. This show does have genuine character beats and arcs, but when all that's mired in content that's essentially one big exploitative fuck-fest, it's hard to take any of it seriously. \\n\\n\r\nBut to the show's credit, it does dedicate a decent amount of time framing the characters' mindsets so that the audience has an understanding as to what makes them tick, as well as why they carry themselves in the way they do. This is made all the more commendable given that a majority of them have despicable personalities. You don't necessarily have to like them, but you do understand how their thought process operates under certain circumstances. This is the definitive attribute it has over its much more cruddy sibling, School Days, where no time or effort was dedicated to any of the main lead's concubines. Scum's Wish, at the very least, gives the illusion that the characters presented are their own person, as with School Days, they were all just assembly-line fuck buddies. Not that it isn't the same case with Scum's Wish, in due time, they're all just reduced to sexual encounter cannon fodder as well. But with the time given beforehand to at least probe their psyche and reasoning behind their actions, they could still be considered to be \"characters\" by the end of it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of School Days, not surprising enough, this sleazy brainchild was also penned by the same scriptwriter as well, Makoto Uezu. The man tends to over exaggerate everything he writes, and where that proves successful with his efforts in comedy-centric shows, for dramas, they have the adverse effect, as demonstrated here, in Arslan Senki, Akame ga Kill and of course, everyone's favorite, School Days. Adequately written drama is not the man's forte. \\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of dramas that became unintentionally funny or embarrassing, Scum's Wish is also plagued with random \"comedic\" cutscenes that began and ended with no discernable reason or benefit for the tone of the series. This usually occurred after an emotionally heavy scene, having the same terrible effect in the way Akame ga Kill would randomly cut to comedic hijinks after someone gets brutally murdered. Whether we could pin this similarity as another fault of Uezu is unknown, as this might just be a result of what the manga does than what the adaptation might be responsible for. Either way, it's a lousy attempt at levity that comes across as awkward the first handful of times it's used. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the actual art and animation of the show demonstrated some thoughtful consideration of how it was constructed. By incorporating panel strips to make scenes flow together\u2014visually emulating manga image tiles\u2014Scum's Wish was able to convey more information by not only accounting for the character's reaction towards a situation but also drawing attention to certain critical moments as they pertain to the people involved within the frame. This allowed the audience to get a general sense of the mood or mindset that's being conveyed by placing a fixated point of interest with things boxed off within the manga panel tiles as it relates to the overall scene. The talented duo behind this thoughtful bit of storytelling was Yukie Oikawa and Masaomi Andou, who's past collaborative efforts together created the technical wizardry demonstrated in Gakkougurashi, where they both made their best Satoshi Kon impression. \\n\\n\r\nCapitalizing off that, the art department showed a keen eye for color placement as well, with cool and warm colors striking a delicate balance, bringing with it visual chemistry on screen. Nothing overpowers the other unless it's done to insinuate a particular mood. An example of which is when they purposely chose to plunge the entire palette in monochromatic blues and dark purples to help give a feeling of isolation, only to use that same coloring technique with soft touches and color highlights to be used for times of intimacy. It's this firm grasp the creators had over color theory that allowed for selective color choices to serve dual purposes under the right guidance.\\n\\n\r\nThey also used splodges of ink and watercolor paint during cutscenes to represent a myriad of emotions and ideas, like lustful desire and deflowerment. While done with no subtlety whatsoever, it was still a nice touch. And even when everything was more than likely digitally colored in, they didn't use that for shorthand around adding personal touches, often giving things soft pastel-like textures and occasional color-penciled-in still shots placed throughout for good measure. Even the character designs are an excellent standout, having anatomically believable body proportions that help the viewer buy into their placement as people within the story. \\n\\n\r\nWith sharp edits used to juxtapose certain situations and letterboxing being applied to convey certain pivotal moments, every idea here was given careful consideration. Yukie Oikawa's acquired abilities from early documented work on Noir up to now has made this a show with a steady hand for cinematics, even if only on a smaller, manageable scale. And to be honest with you, this overall care given for its presentation might be the most significant saving grace for this show. Without it, the show's gimmicky content would be way more apparent than it is now.   \\n\\n\r\nWell, at least for everything within the show, as for the opening and ending themes, however, things couldn't have been more ridiculous had it tried. Starting off with a goofily blaring vocal performance and a flurry of rose petals, the imagery and song throughout the opening were pretty overblown; especially when it hammered home symbolism that felt tacky in comparison to what was presented in the show. But to its credit, the tune wasn't bad on the ears if you just let it play out absent-mindedly. As bad as it may have gotten at times, it doesn't come close to touching the ending theme's issues. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme's visuals were so blatant and try-hard that they actively made me cringe. It reminded me of Zayn's \"Pillowtalk\" music video, which is never a good thing since that was basically the equivalent of someone screaming:\\n\r\n\"Get it BRUH? The FLOWERS represent VAGINAS and WOMEN'S WOMB... and like SEX and stuff, ain't I clever fam?!\"\u2014like no, just stop, you're embarrassing yourself and society. It's the kind of imagery a 15-year-old going through their \"emo phase\" would create, as they wear their Sid Vicious necklace and blast Linkin Park and Pierce the Veil in youthful revolt. By using a mixture of kaleidoscopic visuals to create phallic images, the whole thing aims for contemporary sex appeal along the lines of an FKA Twigs music video but ends up falling incredibly short. It had the tone of a former Nickelodeon child star trying desperately to break free of their kiddie image by being super raunchy. \\n\\n\r\nHaving \"mature themes\" and being \"maturely handled\" aren't the same thing. And when it comes to Scum's Wish, this is an applicable distinction to keep in mind, as the show crosses the line thinking they're one in the same on several occasions. And it's perhaps this issue that's the show's greatest downfall, as it relates to one of the bigger pending problems that need addressing; the character's awareness of themselves and each other. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have this uncanny ability to not only know the inner-workings of their own thought process but also that of everyone around them as well, like if they were all psychology majors. The internal reflection was appreciated, but knowing the mindset and framework of everyone else was a bit ridiculous. Realistically speaking, there should only be two characters in the entire show with that kind of mental capacity, and that were the adults. As a teen, one's ability to discern self and the disposition of others are only achievable on a superficial level. This isn't an \"opinion,\" this is a scientific fact. \\n\r\nI've been in similar situations before as a teen, acting on sexual impulse, but was I fully aware of my decisions to the point of self-reflection? No, because I was horny, not some man musing about life and his choices. This anime treats teens like adults. The phrase \"young, dumb and full of cum\" isn't just passed around to describe youths for a good laugh, it's an expression born from the fact that during that turbulent time of change in your life, teenagers are shortsighted and driven by impulse. You don't start truly thinking with your prefrontal cortex\u2014the rational part of your brain\u2014until you've hit your early to mid-20s when it has fully developed. \\n\\n\r\nWhenever the characters experience emotional woes regarding their actions, that's natural, and again, commendable for the show for trying to depict that. But it's the moment they all become Dr. Phil that it loses touch with itself and reality. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I think I've danced around this long enough.\\n\\n\r\nI'm trying my best not to state the obvious here, but fuck it, time to state the ugly truth of the matter. If your closest thing to intimacy is the love you received from your family, with little to no experience in an actual relationship, then what Scum's Wish depicts may come across more realistic to you than what is actually true. If you only watch anime and haven't ventured out to other mediums, then Scum's Wish offerings may also seem more novel than what it is. However, if sexual relationships\u2014especially in the form of \"fuck buddies\" that this title plays with\u2014are something you've had some passing experience with or hell, if you've seen/read enough other media centering around the subject, then chances are, what Scum's Wish offers to you may be nothing more than animated sleaze. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime's value could easily sway in either direction given the experience of the viewer that looks at it. As such, it's a show that's bound to cause contention among those that adore it and others that mock it. Of course, all of this doesn't even matter if you just want to be entertained, because if that's the case, there's nothing here worth reading that would dissuade you in the slightest. But if for some reason you happen to fall into that small camp that dissects and discuss the content they watch, this show would be met with coin toss results. \\n\\n\r\nYour level of acceptance for what the show depicts depends entirely on your tolerance or love for certain narrative decisions. As for me, I don't see any reason to get up in arms about it. If you see it for what it is, there's no reason to get upset. \\n\\n\r\nScum's Wish lives in a vacuum. Real life is never so perfectly contrived. So instead of focusing on what it mirrors from societal norms, what should be looked at is what it does within the confines of its narrative. And when seen for what it is and not what outside influence it is not, the answer derived is pretty clear; Scum's Wish in its rudimentary form is quite literally animated smut. Meaningful at times but smut nonetheless. That age-old adage \"sex sells\" that's expressed by everyone, from your critics to your everyday viewer, isn't one to easily shake off. It's a commonly known truth for a reason. Sex in and of itself is not a bad topic to center around. It's a natural act we partake in. The issue is when sex is reduced to nothing more than a meal ticket to get audiences through the front door. At that point, any kind of message the show may have had becomes null and void. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, what saved me from entirely dismissing Scum's Wish was the overall care given for its presentation, the extra time dedicated to at least exploring the characters involved, and the fact that content of this perverse nature is easily digestible on a basic entertainment level. As far as anything content-wise is concerned, it falls incredibly short of any meaningful passages in its narrative, save for the individual pockets of occurrences that get drowned out in all the clutter. When everything is said and done, Scum's Wish is a pretty porcelain vase; something beautiful to look at for a while but when peered into, just turns out to be a hollow shell.",

            "content": "Love is perhaps one of the most complicated feelings in the world. We may all have experienced sometimes in our lives. Whether it\u2019s platonic, romantic, or parental, it\u2019s something that humans feel because that\u2019s who we are. As part of growing up, people learn to understand these feelings. Yet, there are also people who make stories out of their lives from such feelings, in ways that become so twisted and disjointed that they become scum. Welcome to Kuzu no Honkai, a show that gives the characters a chance to grow up.\r\nAs a manga reader, I was already prepared although it\u2019s easy to judge by thepremise that the story itself will be saturated with drama. Ever heard of \u2018friends with benefits\u2019? That\u2019s pretty much how the premise sounds like. In the beginning of the story, we learn quickly that Hanabi and Mugi are engaged in a \u201crelationship\u201d that seems like those of a happy couple. Yet deep down, both suffers from pain because they are in love with someone else and are only using each other to ease their pain. It\u2019s not hormone that\u2019s driving these young folks into engaging in sex but that they simply want to feel something rather than pain. I have to admit, a show like this definitely takes on a more mature approach at romance than your typical high school rom-com. Make no mistake about it, Kuzu no Honkai is an emotional story that deconstructs romance in many ways more than one.\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast is small yet complex because almost every character has their own personal issues. Some are more complex than others as the show focuses on them in their own twisted stories. A primary example is Akane, the seemingly lovable teacher. Yet, as the story progresses, you\u2019ll quickly learn that she isn\u2019t exactly what appears to be. Fans could easily label her as a bitch in sheep clothing and hard to accept. It\u2019s also relatable too as Akane is a type of character that can easily be encountered in real life. That\u2019s what also makes this show more realistic than some others as Kuzu no Honkai demonstrates a lot of realism. Relationships draws a line between love and sex. Can sex lead to actual love? Or is it just sex?\\n\\n\r\nIn the meantime, character relationships in the show deconstructs what you\u2019ll find in most romance stories. Yes, there are love triangles but Kuzu no Honkai has characters that uses others to satisfy themselves. Hanabi and Mugi is one but many examples. We\u2019ll also learn in the show of how childhood friends will take the risk of being rejected and hurt. The fact is, no one is really safe of being happy in this series. Happiness is more like an illusionary word in the world of Kuzu no Honokai. Even when certain truths are realized and confessions are made, it is the stone cold truth that brings in even more pain. It doesn\u2019t fall for every circumstance in the show as some characters are more willing to accept reality. However, the truth is still there that makes character relationships in this series seem like a losing battle. That\u2019s a tough pill to swallow.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can imagine, the show is drama heavy with a lot of emotions. Jealousy, regret, greed, hopeful, mistrustful, fear, are just a few to name. Action has consequences and this show brings out the worst out of human behavior. Think about it really. Kuzu no Honokai translates to Scum\u2019s Wish as the title references to one\u2019s interest to satisfy their own desires. Most of the characters does this and is drawn by humans emotions. At the core of these emotions is love. However, this show deconstructs love and very few characters actually understands it. Or perhaps there is no real answer because everyone has different perceptions. Narumi (Hanabi\u2019s homeroom teacher) is a rare example in this show where he accepts certain people for who they are even after learning the truth. Still, the truth can hurt doesn\u2019t it?\\n\\n\r\nYes, don\u2019t expect much comedy or humor from Kuzu no Honkai. It occasionally throws in some comedy from time to time but the majority of the show retains its mature feel. Now, the anime portrays sex as what it is and believe me, there\u2019s a decent amount of it. The manga even has more explicit scenes to illustrate its point. So in essence, this show is not designed for a younger audience but suitable for those looking into a serious yet twisted story. The word \u2018love\u2019 doesn\u2019t fit in there as that word is more or less an illusion. Still, I am happy that the adaptation captured the general idea of the original manga. It sticks to its point without derailing from its coming of age feel while inserting human emotions.\\n\\n\r\nLerche surprisingly did a fairly decent job at crafting the artwork. Character designs look mature especially for the adults such as Akane and Narumi. Ebato has that pure nature lady look that makes her desirable. However, Moca\u2019s character design can be bothersome to get used to as she looks like a child being stuck in a mature world. Be aware that the show has a lot of fan service such as make out scenes, sex, and other suggestive innuendos. One thing I am impressed by the artwork is how there are certain scenes in the show that captures the characters\u2019 expressions at fullest. It accomplishes this with a more detailed visual of their feelings but importantly makes them look impactful.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and music retains a somber tone. It\u2019s a drama heavy story so what else did you expect? It has a feel of melancholy throughout the series along with light instrumental OST. Music director Masaru Yokoyama (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans) does a fantastic job at the directing as expected. The OP and ED theme songs have some symbolism along with a drama-like tone. But in terms of voice mannerisms, this is where it gets sort of mixed. Characters such as Akane and Ebato are really hard not to feel attracted to with their mature voices. In the meantime, I have to mention again that Moca is a source of annoyance whenever she opens her mouth.\\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honokai is like walking into a world of twisted desires. It\u2019s like going into a maze with endless doors and no way out. Behind every door is a truth or lie that brings anything but joy. However, I think the show does bring up a good point of showing the realism of love. Examples in this series can really happen to anyone and realistically, it does. It\u2019s part of us being human as there\u2019s no real answer to what love is. Or to put it simply\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nLove hurts.\\n",

            "content": "Kuzu no Honkai has finished airing and it's been a fun ride, so let's talk about the show.\r\nKuzu no Honkai is not your tipical romance anime, I've seen many people complaining about it and I understand them (especially after the last two episodes that destroyed my favourite character's personality), as a matter of fact this anime is not suited for everyone: as the title suggest the story revolves around scummy people and their desires, so there's nothing pleasurable to be seen. \r\nStory: 7\r\nKuzu no Honkai is the story of a girl who discovers her true feelings through sexual growth.\r\nThe story's intro is quite interesting: thetwo main characters try to find solace in each other because they actually love their teachers. After this some supporting characters are introduced and the story takes a twisted and fucked up turn. If you don't care about romantic relationships you'll enjoy the anime until the last episodes, where everything was rushed and hadn't a proper explanation. But I have to say that I really liked how the show ended, I didn't see that coming. Overall it's not bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 \\n\r\nThe art is beautiful and I love the animation: the VN like sequences were pretty good and fit the mood of the story. \\n\r\nHowever I found the character design a bit bland, the male characters looked very much alike, I swear I wouldn't have recognised them apart without checking their hair colour. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\r\nThis show has one of the best soundtracks among the animes of the winter season; the piano OSTs were soothing and relaxing. Also the voice acting was ok, nothing bothered me about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7 \\n\r\nThe characters aren't stereotyped and they undergo some development throughout the show (many of them are really worthy \"scum\" as the title suggests), but I didn't like the sudden and rushed change of some characters, these changes felt unrealistic and forced.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 \\n\r\nWhen I watched the first episode I couldn't handle my curiosity and I read the manga. The anime ended before the manga and I liked it, I was never bored when I was watching Kuzu no Honkai even though my expectations were maybe a little too high after reading the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 \\n\r\nThis show deserves a chance, it's not a conventional romance; if you're looking for something original and psychological and you don't care about ships give this show a try. It is very good in its horribility.",

            "content": "Kuzu no Honkai (Scum\u2019s Wish) portrays how we all have a desire, oftentimes bad or \u201cscum\u201d type of desires and how we act upon those desires. This anime is not for the lover of sweet romance because the story is a bit psychological and melancholic. Here\u2019s the reason why I keep watching and waiting for the next installment of the episodes.\r\nStory: 9\r\nI like the narration of the story here. You can see clearly in the story why the character or the story ended up that way because it was narrated very well. Aside from that, after every episode, there is a dialogue/monologue from a characterthat would leave you wanting to watch more.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe animation/art is very clean and easy to look at. I usually don\u2019t like fight scenes in an anime because of too much color in it. You could also see that there are times that the artwork will change, like how the expression or color of the eyes will change, suggesting or telling the audience what the character feels or thinks at that exact moment. The part where there is a word written in pink background that suddenly goes black is a very good indication of something psychological. The ending animation is also very well done, as if the stories of the characters where just a glimpse in a kaleidoscope; with just a simple turn, the image changes, so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe background sounds almost always fits the emotion, scenery, situation and animation. It\u2019s complimenting the story and the art. And about the soundtracks, the dialogue at every ending blended with the entry of the ending song is a total killer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe characters\u2019 development and personality is also very good. They\u2019re hopeless romantics, melancholic, and desperate and sees the world in only one direction which kind of make the characters more real.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nDid I enjoy the anime? I would not wait every Thursday for 9 hours just to watch the next installment if I didn\u2019t! Maybe we all just love to have a little drama in our lives, and Kuzu no Honkai surely satisfy those needs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI like how the characters were drawn, how the expression on their eyes changes which gives clues as to what the character is feeling or thinking at that moment. At first, I just like the animation, but I think the story is a bit hard to handle. But as I watched the episodes again, I started to like the story. The way the characters think, their being hopeless romantics, and their melancholy and desperation makes the story so real. The characters\u2019 dialogue at the end blended with the entry of the ending song is a total killer.\\n\\n\r\nThe only let down is that the story and animation are so mature, I can\u2019t watch it at the living room.\\n",

            "content": "Have you gotten sick of \"romance\" anime consisting of nothing but innocent teenagers blushing like tomatoes at the mere thought of holding hands yet? Are you sick of seeing \"relationships\" implying that there may or may not be a confession in the last minute of the final episode and nothing beyond that? Well then Kuzu no Honkai might be for you, because this anime has more romantic progression in its first five minutes than most romance anime do in their entire runtime, and it manages to break one, two, maybe even three taboos in the process as well.\r\nKuzu no Honkai at heart represents the uglinessof human emotions and carnal base desires. It looks into the darker side of romance and tackles matters which romance anime basically never does. This is not a story about how to woo your would-be waifu of choice, but rather it deals with issues such as how to emotionally cope with having an impossible unrequited love, reflecting on yourself as a human being and opening your eyes to your own flaws, and considering what it must be like for the target of your unrequited affection if you force your own feelings onto them. It showcases how love truly is blind and that you can end up falling for the wrong person against your better judgement, and you just cannot help but desire them anyway. It is a very depressive and heart-wrenching story throughout, but also psychological and packed to the brim with moral lessons to be learned. And it all culminates in one of the most unique, artistic and legitimately fascinating romance anime I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways, Kuzu no Honkai is effectively the polar opposite of most romance anime. Mind you, that does not mean that it is too much more realistic; in fact Kuzu no Honkai is just as exaggerated except in the opposite direction. While the characters are all (more or less) realistic individually, the fact that they all happen to be such emotionally broken wrecks and that they are somehow all connected in one big messy love polygon at the same time is a bit too implausible. However, realism is ultimately not the main purpose of this story, but rather to provide a significantly less glorified outlook on romance that showcases that love is not always easy and not always as beautiful as anime generally likes to make it out to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing I really like about Kuzu no Honkai is how it does not beat around the bush. Whilst most anime characters seem scared to even hold hands with their respective crush, in this anime we have Mugi and Hanabi willingly tongue-wrestling with each other within the first three minutes of the first episode. This then proves to be nothing more than a prelude of what is to come as the anime has a lot of actual sexual interaction between numerous different characters over the course of the story. However, it is also done in a way which makes it seem like it is not really a big deal to have sex, and that it is something merely a natural part of relationships or even done just for the sake of emotional comfort. You are never given the impression that the sex scenes in Kuzu no Honkai are anything perverted or something out of the ordinary enough to freak out about. This is also largely attributed to the very artistic directing of the anime. What might otherwise have been written off as nothing but smut ends up coming across as something poetic and emotional, albeit perhaps not straight-up beautiful due to the anime's rather questionable morals. The visuals make great usage of the original manga's design by actually showcasing a lot of screens with multiple manga style panels instead of normal full screen animation. It is a bit difficult to explain without seeing it with your own eyes, but I personally found it very effectual and artistic, and it greatly helped to set the rather melancholic tone of the anime as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nAt heart, the anime is mostly about hopeless affections. The two main characters Mugi and Hanabi are both in love with someone else who they know they can probably never have, and only utilize each other as replacements for their actual crushes. But they are not the only outcasts in this anime as amogst the other people involved in the love polygon we have a homosexual, a man-eating slut, and more. Everyone has some sort of deep-rooted emotional issue as for why their feelings are almost assuredly never going to transcend into mutual love along with their crush, and they all have different ways of trying to deal with it, such as self-denial, clouding of judgement, or just selfishly forcing their feelings upon their beloved regardless of the consequences. This all results in the whole situation becoming increasingly messy and entangled with each passing episode, which makes the story both unpredictable and dramatic, but it also fills you with some sort of sadistic pleasure by watching everyone's worlds continuously come crumbling down, solely to then be able to watch in fascination how the characters somehow try to climb out of the holes they themselves created. It is a pretty typical case of curiosity killed the cat.\\n\\n\r\nThe main question you have to ask yourself whilst watching this anime is \"what is the right thing to do?\" in the characters' respective circumstances. More often than not, the logical answer and the emotional answer stand in direct contradiction to one another. Their heads tell them that they should try to let go of their hopeless feelings of affection, but their hearts say that they have to keep pushing forward, no matter the cost. And really, you cannot say that one option is any more or less \"correct\" than the other. Is it acceptable to sacrifice someone else's happiness in pursuit of your own, and is it okay to keep feigning ignorance of reality just because the current lie you are living in \"feels good\"? There is not really a right answer here, as regardless of what you do, someone is guaranteed to end up miserable and unhappy in the end no matter what, and Kuzu no Honkai showcases this dilemma to great effect.\\n\\n\r\nOf course that is not to say that there are not a couple of times where I feel like the writers go a bit too far whilst trying to overplay the misery that Kuzu no Honkai has to offer. Especially Akane--who is arguably the real bad guy in this mess (if you can call her that)--sometimes feels a bit *too* malicious. The way she just casually tries to break Hanabi's heart in the most sickening ways possible time and time again feels like it goes a bit beyond what her own motivations seem to rationally justify that she should want to, and there is also one scene where you can see her sadistically licking her lips the way a second-rate villain from some B movie would do... which seems like they writers are trying to force on the image that \"this woman is evil\" a bit too directly. That is not to say that Akane does not function as a villain though because she is certainly a character you love to hate, but I cannot help but find the way they reached that goal to have been a bit forced at times.\\n\\n\r\nIn the grand scheme of things though, the hiccups of Kuzu no Honkai are rather sparse in comparison to how many good things there are about it. It is an unorthodox and exceptionally well-written show with very interesting characters. It also has some very artistic directing in general and even boasts with having some absolutely superb opening and ending themes. And while the story as a whole might still feel a bit implausible at times, it nonetheless gets its messages across in great fashion. Ultimately, what you are left with is one of the most memorable romance dramas in a very long time, and although it is certainly not an anime for everyone given its controversial themes, I think it is also one of those shows which if you manage to see it for what it truly is, then there really are not very many series quite like it. Overall, Kuzu no Honkai is probably the best romance anime I have seen in the last few years, and one I will eagerly recommend people for a long time to come as well.",

            "content": "Since episode 2 I'm waiting for this anime to just deliver the final blow so I can finally drop it in peace (and for good this time). Not because it's complete garbage\u2026 But the way it's going right now, I really don't know for how much longer I can sit through this. Good heavens. \u00d4_\u00d3\r\n\u201eScum's Wish\u201c, more like \u201eFriends With Benefits: The Anime\u201c is about people being each other's replacements for people they cannot have. Which is an interesting premise, that anime as a medium hasn't explored too often yet, I agree. Nonetheless it's also a premise that can be ruined spectacularly with so littleeffort, and I feel like it's already taking that route.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (5/10):\\n\r\n- up until now, nothing but wasted potential. The majority of episode 1 seemed so very interesting, but I feel my expectations shattering more and more with every new episode :'D What expectations? Well I certainly didn't expect a freaking jizzfest, which by now, it totally is. You may think I'm just oversensitive here, when I'm in fact all for anime showing and exploring sexuality more (and better) than it has until now, really. But guys... When an anime that's partially ABOUT physical intimacy makes me cringe whenever there's physical intimacy...it's doing something terribly wrong. I came here to watch characters cope with all the struggles and emotions that may come with screwing around- NOT to actually watch the characters screw around all the time.\\n\r\nMaybe anime's just really bad with sex scenes in general. Still, this one would definitely be a lot better if it reduced its amount of sex ever so slightly and would use that extra time to...idk, maybe handle its core themes a little better instead. For example by exploring the characters' complex emotions a little more deeply/detailed, but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (5/10):\\n\r\nThey're scum, hence the title LOL- No I'm not even kidding, they're all kinda slutty and really unlikable most of the time (especially the main girl and the \u201cantagonist\u201c), - Which isn't automatically a bad thing, I even think it's one of the show's strengths.\\n\r\nWhen a character isn't just unlikable though, but also starts making fucking dumb or utterly selfish decisions...then I don't want to root for them anymore, I'm sorry. For god's sake, I can't even empathize with the redhead anymore, they managed to ruin the one gay character within just 1-2 episodes. Basically just shortly after I'd even figured out she's gay, so at least I didn't have enough time to hope for a proper character arc in the first place. Joke's on you!\\n\r\nAnyway, onwards to the other (attention-) whores: \u2026 Do I even care enough at this point? Dear Kuzu no Honkai, if you want to make me care, you have to show me something more than characters being hopelessly infatuated with one another like, 24/7. Don't they like, do or think about anything else? If so, then show me. If not, they're the most unrealistic and unlikable bunch of twats I've seen in anime :'D I guess we'll just have to wait and see. And hope for lots, LOTS of character-development.\\n\\n\r\nART (8/10):\\n\r\nI like it, very much so. I think it's pulling off that novel-y style with the written words and floating images really well. Then there's this lack of outlines, which may look a little weird at first, but I find it very pretty and refreshing :) So luckily, however dumb the story might still get, the art is and will always be beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (7/10):\\n\r\nIt's funny how the opening's the one thing that made me come back after I had initially dropped the show. That's how insanely good it is...!!! I love that song, I love the visuals \u2026 so pretty. Why can't the show be more like its OP :') The background music and sound in general are alright as well. Oh, except the kissing sounds. They're horrible.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (4/10) ---> OVERALL (5,8/10):\\n\r\nI want to enjoy this show, I really do. Not least because its themes are so relatable and common (to a certain extent). But instead of teaching me stuff, I feel like Kuzu no Honkai is doing NOT A THING the way I'd EVER do it.\\n\r\nSo no, I can't get anything from this show (yet), wake me up when I care. Though I can't bring myself to rate it too low either, it's not that bad... Let's just hope it gets more...insightful, meaningful, deeper, whatever. Just make it better! And let's hope the plot isn't actually that predictable as it seems (cos it seems awfully predictable).",

            "content": "From the Writer of School Days comes SCHOOL DAYS 2 Electric Boogaloo. Every so often there's that one anime that the masses throw roses to that I just don't get, Higurashi, Elfen Lied, Sword Art Online, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. \r\nI'll have to let Scum's Wish (Kazu no Honkai) be a good reminder to really examine the premise of a show more closely before watching.  The genres were interesting enough to catch my eye in the first place, romantic drama, psychological and so on it sounded like good makings for a more serious romance after watching the more light hearted and bubbly romance shows thatI loved such as One Week Friends, Yona of the Dawn and Snow White With the Red Hair so the best I could hope for is something like Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (Kannazuki no Miko) but rather I ended up with was School Days redux that mysteriously is trending better than School Days for the supposed \"maturity\" it has.  \\n\\n\r\nThe basic concept of two teenagers forming a pact to quell their loneliness should sound and come as a heart breaking romance or the potential of a feel good story where they find the love with each other or learn to accept and move on from their first loves or just face the trials of young love in general, a multitude of ways but the first episode left such a sour taste in my mouth that I only hope for a miserable end to our two little losers who deserve what they get.  \\n\\n\r\nHanabi Yasuroka is in love with an older man who is her teacher but curiously refers to him as her older brother despite no relations and Mugi Awaya likewise is in love with a teacher that appears to be in love with the man who Hanabi is in love with but in reality is a sexual sadist who enjoys using men.  Then we're introduced to Noriko Kamomebata who is in love with Mugi and then to Sane Ebato who is in love with Hanabi! Can this awful love web become more convoluted and ridiculous?\\n\\n\r\nThough having no actual romantic ties our two main characters certainly love to get physical enough to have the most casual sex and try to write it off as nothing and love to deny being anything more than cheap friends with benefits.  Anime fans laud this show for the \"maturity\" but casual sex in an anime isn't maturity it's just fanservice that goes a little further than the usual bouncing boobs and panty shots we're usually treated to in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode by itself is a mess in structure jumping between time periods of past and present and the confusing referral of Hanabi's love interest as her brother leads a viewer to believe this may be an incest based anime.  In fact I'm convinced that's why is just to give it an incest angle for the incest fetish without having to do incest. The second episode began to narrow its focus but everything keeps jumping around it becomes hard to tell what is ever going on at any given time because of the massive story leaps but by later episodes it begins to take on more linear approaches and calms down long enough to focus on moments when our characters aren't doing tongue action every five minutes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very nice looking it is pretty with some interesting use of panel shots replicating the feel of a manga without overdoing it (see 3 Gatsu no Lion for that) but they have a real tendency to abuse the hidden eyes trope many anime do wherein a characters eyes will disappear either to reflect deep emotion or be scary and intimidating for a moment.  Many anime as I mention do this from time to time but I can't say I've seen an anime do it so much.\\n\\n\r\nAnd musically the show's melodic score does enrich the atmosphere it's just a shame it's wasted on such a terrible concept. I can't say any one piece really stands out or underscores moments so perfectly but it does feel suited for the moments at each hand.\\n\\n\r\nScum's Wish I feel is trying to go for a \"so uncomfortable\" vibe, which can be done well, one only need watch David Fincher films but the cast of deplorable characters added with the sappy, convoluted over the top writing make this show unbearable to sit through.",

            "content": "You can easily say that Kuzu no Honkai (Scum\u00b4s wish) without a doubt has been one of the big talks of the winter 2017 season. Either people praise this new angle on a romance story in anime, or are disturbed by the emo depressed characters that does one scummy thing after another. \r\nWell, Scum\u00b4s wish for shore manages to separate itself from its siblings in the genres, much do to with that it is including sex as one of the big factors. Because let\u00b4s be honest, most high school kids are exploring their sexuality and are not going out for months before they have theirfirst glowing wonderful kiss (which often is the case in many anime\u00b4s). It\u2019s often much less romantic than that. That at least Scum\u00b4s wish manage to portray very well \u2013 often you don\u00b4t need to have romantic feelings or care for the person in question, for physical and intimate contact. Even if Scum\u00b4s wish is labelled as a \u201cRomance\u201d anime, there is very little actual romance in it. Other themes such as rejection, unrequired feelings, loneliness, egotism, replacement, sexuality, naivety, desire, selfishness, and jealousy are explored much more than an actual two-sided romance.  As for the characters \u2013 they truly are scum driven by instincts most of the time, and therefore are very hard to like or understand. At least they are to me. \\n\\n\r\nBut the question you probably having, is it any good or worth watching? I will get down to that now.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Character: 3,5/10\\n\r\nThe first words that\u2019s comes in mind to me are \u201cSoap opera with an emo-soft porn touch\u201d. As in many anime of this kind, the plot is mostly, if not only character driven. The plot is the character\u2019s actions, thoughts and interactions, therefore I\u00b4m bundling the story aspect and character aspect here in one. \\n\r\nThat\u00b4s not necessarily making this kind of show good or bad, it just is what is. But then all the weight is on the characters and if they fail to do their job to make you feel and care about them... Well, then the whole experience can become much less enjoyable then it could have been. The thing is that most of the characters in Scum\u00b4s wish is unlikable and hard to relate to. *light spoiler* Is there a time that you felt so lonely that you slept with your friend of the same sex, even do you are straight, just to feel less lonely? If not, you see my point. *end light spoiler* The characters are very self-centred, lost, egoistic and outright scum most of the time. You have Hanabi (female MC), who is a cute lonely/empty high school girl with a big brother complex and crush on her male teacher, Mugi (male MC), the normal but slightly depressed handsome high school boy with a slut teacher complex and a crush on his female music teacher, Moca, Loli childhood friend with long time crush on mentioned male MC, Ecchan, lesbian friend with a crush on female MC, Akane, said female music teacher with a thing for sleeping with men that have other women loving them (just to get the kicks off their sadness and jealousy), and a Nerdy, clueless and naive male teacher that has a shy personality and a mother complex. And there you have the set-up for this \u201clove\u201d hexagon. Many times, I almost wished for that bad things would happen to them because they kind of deserved it. In the same time, I was kind of enjoying this new input in an anime, you aren\u00b4t meant to like the characters. They are deliberately written like that and that\u00b4s also what\u2019s makes Scum\u00b4s wish interesting in its own way. So even if I really disliked the characters (some much more than others \u2013 yes, looking at you Akane), they still managed to make me want to watch them and their drama. Who was going to get rejected/fucked/used/do something randomly humiliating next? This phenomenon made me want to know what weird thing was going to happen next, and to keep watching this emo-soft porn drama week after week. A large amount of the show focuses on the character\u2019s thoughts and reasoning\u2019s. Most of the time it\u00b4s kind of depressing emo-philosophical stuff about the unrequired love, loneliness, how a bad of a person he/she is and how they use people, and the wish to change oneself. As mentioned before, the romance/love aspect is almost absent \u2013 most of the time there\u00b4s about desire and filling an empty place (both literally and figural speaking). And about control and sooth one\u2019s boredom or loneliness. And by doing so getting involved with multiple people without give a shit about their feelings, to fill this empty place in one\u00b4s heart, soul, and\u2026 You get it. Other than emo-emotional/sexual stuff revolving the characters it isn\u00b4t much to the story. So, if you can put up with that, go ahead and watch it. If not, this is probably not for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation is pretty great \u2013 it has a certain quality about it. Mostly in form of shoujo beautiful backgrounds and scenery\u2019s. Much effort has also been put on more detailed parts, such as the character\u2019s eyes, with multi-layered colours and lights, or rain drops that\u2019s falls and causes ripples in a puddle. And the blushing and sweating of sexually aroused characters is\u2026 hum... very pronounced. The colour palette that is used is very aquarelle with a wide spanning of the colour spectrum. It has a softness to it that is quite a contrast to the characters/story. The character designs are nothing unique or special. They have a pretty common anime standard design. For the animation, it\u00b4s absolutely fine, but nothing outstanding either. It has few weird motions and angles, but didn\u2019t blow my mind either.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nFor the soundtrack a lot of piano/guitar combos are used, with a sadder/melancholic touch to it. Which I suppose matches the mental states of the characters. Vocal songs are used but not that frequently. All over decent in my opinion. The OP is actually pretty good, it\u00b4s an upbeat pop song that\u00b4s gives of more energy than anything in show itself. The ED\u00b4s is also pretty good, and which I think is supposed to reflect all the confusing and mixed emotions the characters are feeling.\\n\\n\r\nFor background sounds and such, it does its job but nothing especially memorable. Waring, a lot of slobby kissing sounds are present every episode. That could be a huge turn of for some viewers. For the VA\u00b4s (Japanese) I think they did their job pretty well. It would be exaggeration to say that they really brought life into their characters, because the characters themselves appeared pretty lifeless to me. But they did a good job with the character they had to work with.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nSo, was it any good? Not particularly for me, but Scum\u00b4s wish do have something that made me keep watching it and see if there is any progression of the characters and their wishes. Even if I didn\u00b4t really felt for the character\u2019s personalities, I still was somewhat entertained by this soft-porn emo drama anyway. Scum\u00b4s wish was something new I hadn\u00b4t watched 10 shows just like it before, and brought a new perspective to the genres. A little bit refreshing if nothing else. So, I enjoyed some of it, was disgusted by some of it, was irritated of some of it, and was pretty entertained of some of it. I would say, that for me it was worth the watch and I don\u00b4t want to charge anyone for my time back.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nThe unlikable characters both made this show to something new and interesting, and at the same time puts sticks in the wheel for its self. I became somewhat emotional invested in the characters but for the wrong reasons. I wanted bad stuff (some karma please) to happen to them because of their egoistic and often childish behaver. But I definitely can\u00b4t call Scum\u00b4s wish boring or particularly bad. It still manages to entertain me to the degree of me watching it to the end, and be curious about what was going to happen next. So, I would not recommend this show for everyone, especially if you are looking for a cosy romance story. You aren\u2019t going to find any of that in Scum\u00b4s wish. But if you like the genres and want to see something that hasn\u00b4t been done before and give a new perspective, go ahead and dig in to the scummy characters of Scum\u00b4s wish.  \\n\\n\r\nI hope you found this review somewhat helpful and informative. Cheers! \\n",

            "content": "\u201cWhy can\u2019t it be me?\u201d\r\nLove and lust are two terms synonymous with the young and naive but understood by those who\u2019ve experienced both. \u201cLovesick\u201d teenagers are often impressionable and irrational, driven by an overwhelming cesspool of hormones and emotions. Love is ambiguous at a young age, and can often be a stifling enigma. Lust is an enveloping, instinctive thirst for a partner\u2019s sexual freedom. Although these concepts can be weighty and complicated, experiencing them is part of what makes us human, and are as intense as any incident we\u2019re likely to encounter in our lives. Scum\u2019s Wish is a visceral, raw and uncomfortable approach tolove and lust, and even deeper, what makes our minds tick from a relationship perspective. Does it succeed in translating the equivocal nature of human sexuality or does it miss the mark?\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by the small scale Studio Lerche (Assassination Classroom), Scum\u2019s Wish takes the concept of a love triangle to unfathomable new heights by adding a dynamic and cunning twist, where love escapes the limelight. What we\u2019re left with is an askew pile of sexual hatred and numbness that is downright unsettling. One night stands, homosexuality, virginity and incest are all covered at some point in the anime\u2019s short 12 episode run, in an attempt to unearth the deepest and darkest fantasies of virtually everyone in the cast. The problem is, to achieve this level of promiscuity, the writers lose the credibility they attempt to obtain due to the dialogue and monologues drowning in a sea of melodrama. \\n\\n\r\nOur main character, Hanabi is in love with her life long \u201cbrother\u201d figure Mr. Kanai, who in turn is in love with a fellow teacher, who just happens to be the apple of her classmate Mugi\u2019s eye, so naturally Mugi and Hanabi start a facade of a relationship to help them cope with the unattainable \u201cunicorn\u201d they\u2019ll never be with. Honestly, the whole premise sounds like a joke. Add in an aggressive lesbian who falls for Hanabi within minutes of being saved from a pervert on a crowded subway, a goodie two-shoes lolli who is unfailingly devoted to Mugi\u2019s love and a creeper who\u2019s constantly trying to molest his cousin and the wheels start to fall off the believability. Almost every facet of Scum\u2019s Wish revolves around sex, causing the series to be rather unnerving.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s one thing to talk about sensitive subject matter like chastity or innocence in an anime, but when it becomes diluted to the point of omission, the initial argument is lost entirely. Scum\u2019s Wish attempted to bombard its audience with too many sexual themes in too little time, resulting in a desensitized viewership just aching to skip ahead to the \u201clove scenes\u201d. If the point was to shower us in copious amounts of fanservice, it could\u2019ve been done with a lot less effort and cash. If the point was to incite pondering and stimulating intellectual debate about love and its many intricacies, each theme should\u2019ve been handled with care. Instead, these taboo topics become nonchalant and shadows of their former selves. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the anime are a mix of plausible and irrational. Although I added in the beginning that love can make us do the dumbest things, some of the behavior exhibited by Scum\u2019s Wish\u2019s cast is unbelievable at best. A teacher sleeping with her students has happened before, hell it\u2019s even been in the news. But the way it\u2019s scripted here seems slightly schizophrenic\u2026 revenge taken on a girl half your age to shelter your own inadequacies? Highly unlikely. I think Hanabi sleeps with everyone in the show, except the person she wants the most\u2026 but you know what, it\u2019s okay because she never went \u201call the way\u201d with any of them. She\u2019s incredibly dense, despite having an overwhelming barrage of internal monologues throughout the series, describing who she should be with next and why. The real question is, \u201cwhy do I even care about this?\u201d Mugi may be even worse, but being a teenage dude, his testosterone is probably blinding his potentially intelligent decisions. Mugi and Hanabi\u2019s relationship never really made sense to me, from inception to the conclusion of the series. It felt as though it only existed as a plot crutch, and to allow the writers to slam a bunch of other themes in our face along the way. \\n\\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t care less for the other characters in Scum\u2019s wish. Their sexual struggles always seemed to be the lifejacket keeping them relevant, though I couldn\u2019t get onboard with any of their causes. The empathy just wasn\u2019t there for me. Even Kanai, who I initially perceived to be the sole intelligent, unblinded character in the show succumbed to his libido and broke his innocence eventually. Scum\u2019s Wish tries to shove down our throat that it\u2019s okay to be a slut, everyone\u2019s doing it! But in all actuality, these characters are just playing out the desires our meek and timid selves are too reserved to pursue. And why does every character need to whisper all the damn time? I felt like every line was so soft and overexaggerated.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Scum\u2019s Wish is top notch, and when incorporated into certain scenes, really made my heart race. If there\u2019s one thing that Studio Lerche nailed (pun intended), it would be the orchestration of the love scenes. Sweat dripping, pulse pounding, moaning and blushing all around make this anime one not to watch with a friend, unless you want some supremely awkward silences or dinner conversations. The character models are attractive and crisp, while the environments (if you even noticed them) are accurate and consistent. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also a high point for me, definitely a soundtrack that fit the atmosphere of the show. Each sexual encounter was brilliantly timed with an epic addition of strings, while the plotting and scheming soliloquies were laden with an equally devious accompaniment. Ironically enough, I didn\u2019t really care for the OP, as it didn\u2019t really flow with the anime at all. A fast-paced JPop song with a relatively melancholy vibe just irked me. The ED was more appropriate, and really captured the tarnished innocence that Habani exuded throughout the series. Slightly haunting, and stunningly accurate. The voice acting was decent, though nothing out of the ballpark necessarily. I did like the apathy echoing through Habani\u2019s voice during her monologues, a nice job for sure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Scum\u2019s Wish was a promising anime that became corrupted by the oversaturation of its sexual themes. The result was an uncomfortable, guilty pleasure that is best reserved for watching by yourself, on an introverted, quiet night alone. Those of you less intellectual might want to grab a tissue, though not necessarily for tears\u2026 I can assuredly say that this series pushed the envelope of what I might find appropriate to watch in anime, and I haven\u2019t really seen anything like it before. I\u2019d recommend it if you are really into hormonal, melodramatic sexual escapades, or are looking for a show with adult subject matter and want something completely different. I enjoyed it, but not enough to say it\u2019s a must watch\u2026 and definitely not the anime of the season. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out the rest of my Winter \u201817 reviews!",

            "content": "Unrequited love presents a tiny window of hope on the verge of shattered by crippling depression and anxiety. To not be able to share yourself with the person who brings color to your world, even worse watch them fall for someone perceived as better than you, is a feeling will that leave your emotions on the brink of suicide as your scum filled obsessions grow too loud to silence anymore. \r\nKuzu No Honkai is a study on the psychology of unrequited love, how adolescents will make the mistake of equating self worth with sexual desirability and how that can inspire one to make terrible choicesout of desperation. This is not an anime about frivolous sex from horny kids. Kuzu No Honkai offers a nuanced take on the pursuit of love as a group of teenagers attempt to solve a common question that has no answers. \\n\\n\r\nMugi and Hanabi are the antithesis to your average romance protagonist - acting on their every sexual desire and being honest with themselves at the expense of other people's feelings. Growing frustrated with their unrequited feelings, The 17 year olds decide to use one another as substitutes in order to fulfill their raging desires. Make no mistake about it - this is a narrowminded, lust filled decision that only serves to make their misery even worse, but it's also realistic. Making rash in the moment choices is a consequence of love, and Kuzu No Honkai uses it's characters as a vehicle to explore these mistakes and what can evolve from them.\\n\\n\r\nMugi struggles with his own self worth, contemplating if hes nothing more than a human pillow for the opposite sex based on his encounters that extended no further than the bedroom. Mugi is an intelligent person who understands exactly what he wants. Just not necessarily how to capture it - a recurring theme of his character arc. \\n\\n\r\nAbandoned by her father at an early age, Hanabi subconsciously looks to patch that void in her heart with sexual partners. She yearns to be desired. To be obsessed over and idolized. This vain personality adds to the authenticity of her character as it's normal for humans to seek confirmation. She is less experienced than Mugi, but a quick learner that changes dramatically episode to episode for better or worse.\\n\\n\r\nGiven their issues they could not have chosen worse people to fall in love with - a narcissistic man eater in who is the finest specimen of slutiness that anime has possibly ever seen, and an oblivious innocent sensei who sticks out like a sore thumb among all the other twisted personalities around him. They are the source, if not the antagonist, for the drama in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs if this tangled web wasn't complicated enough, Mugi and Hanabi are both loved by friends who they don't feel the same towards. Noriko wants her Prince Charming Mugi all for herself, in need of a reality check in the worst way. Sanae is is infatuated to the point of unhealthy obsession with Hanabi. Through her is a well told yuri tale that highlights how difficult it can be for the queer to let go of people that won't reciprocate their feelings. \\n\\n\r\nKuzu No Honkai offers a balanced perspective with each character being given the opportunity to narrate their experiences. This levels the moral playing field making it clear that no one is being judged for their transgressions, and gives the viewer a chance to dive into their minds to get a better understanding for their choices. By the end it truly feels as if you've lived through these characters decisions - especially if able to connect to any of them personally.\\n\\n\r\nWhile many will flock to this anime for the sexual innuendo, Kuzu No Honkai isn't explicit just for the sake of it. Attached to every moment of passion is a deep inner monologue on its significance. Rather than the act itself, the rationale and consequences thereafter are emphasized most.  There's a large segment of the anime community that took issue with the gratuitous amount of sexual content, seemingly not understanding that sex is the end goal of mutual attraction. If anything romantic works should have more intimacy scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is sublime, helping to accentuate the somber atmosphere and offer smooth transitions into important scenes. The opening \"Uso no Hibana\" has a frantic pace that meshes well with the nonstop drama and helps to narrate the story itself. The final lyrics \"I'm in so much pain, I love you so much it scares me\" is literally everything this anime stands for. The ending \"Heikosen\" offers a slower, more intense contrast filled with kaleidoscope visuals that fits seamlessly as the closing credits begin.\\n\\n\r\nI had concerns as to how this anime would translate the heaviness of the manga. Key word had, those concerns were laid to rest minutes into the first episode - Studio Lereche does an admirable job of molding attractive character designs and creating an inviting aesthetic that suits the tone of the story. Director Masaomi Ando uses dramatic pauses frequently in moments of high tension, flashing Kanji across the screen when there's a cut in the animation, and is an expert at using paneling techniques to create flow in scenes. From an design perspective the eyes of each character stood out most - they look soulless, aligning well with the overall theme of narrow minded obsession. The color design is dark, much of the anime takes place in a dim lit room, and the director does a good job of using manga panels to help scenes flow to perfection. Make no mistake about it - this is a gorgeous looking work of art that anyone should be able to appreciate whether you agree with the story or not.\\n\\n\r\nKuzu No Honkai is the most controversial anime of the Winter season by a mile. There's been loud criticism of the characters being too depressing, lacking realism and making poor decisions. To those critics I must ask - what world do you live in where teenagers aren't indecisive flakes unsure of what they want? Part of being an adolescent is the period of self discovery through arduous trial and error. Most adults aren't able to follow through with all of their promises, let alone high school students who have just entered the precipice of puberty. Rather than give us cookie cutter characters who feign knowledge of the world, Kuzu No Honkai is filled with young people who are actively seeking answers to their problems confused about just where to go next in life. This anime does not lack authenticity - it succeeds as a portrayal of its themes by offering an ample amount of discussion on the minds of each character\\n\\n\r\nKuzu No Honkai takes an open mind to enjoy. If you go into it with a preconceived notion on how romance should be explored, or how much intimacy should be allowed in anime, you won't like it. If you can appreciate an anime that is willing to go the extra mile in order to explore a topic rarely touched upon in the genre, it can be one of the greatest romantic works you've ever encountered - that was certainly the case for me. In a genre filled with beauty Kuzu No Honkai chooses to be ugly, detailing a love gone wrong from every which angle for the world to see.",

            "content": "It's been so long since a studio has dared to release an anime like \"Kuzu no Honkai\". Ever since the creators of Aku no Hana got death threats for their show, studios have been reluctant to include depressive moods and apathy mixed with romance into their anime. Kozu no Honkai takes this exact step, but presents it in a more cheerful fashion that can apply to broader audiences.\r\nIf you are a fan of manga such as \"Oyasumi Punpun\" or \"Umibe no Onnako\" like me, this is the closest you can get to the same mood and atmosphere in new anime. If you are not, andjust like love triangles, this is a great opportunity to take a dive into the world of unrequited love where people become so mentally tormented that they settle for anything to suppress their feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are mentally destroyed, the detail and art are amazing, story is good(4 episodes in so far) and the characters are great.\\n\\n\r\nI want to emphasise the last point. I am a fan of every single character in this show. If you have ever been in love, you know that the characters are doing exactly what is supposed to be expected when you are head over heels for someone in a realistic way. The anime doesn't make the characters go yandere from love but instead, it makes them weak and vulnerable when they are around their beloved ones.\\n\\n\r\nI hope that this shows popularity will at least spike a small change in the anime business and hopefully we can get more of this type of mature romance anime out in the coming year.\\n\\n\r\nI will probably add a conclusion to this review once the series is finished, but right now all I can do is to enjoy the show :]",

Repeat this for 12 episodes with different combinations of X and Y and congratulations, you've finished this amazing series.\\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai is pretty much a hate-it-or-love-it kind of anime. The problem with this series is mainly how pretentious it appears to be. \"I'm 17 and I'm deep\" is the theme of the day. When I was in high school, the first and foremost thing on my mind was passing the university entrance exams. Relationships were important but I never forgot my priorities. Of course, that's only me, and you can't compare an anime to real life, but they wouldn't have made it a high school setting if they didn't want people to relate to it. I'll take the liberty to allude to Golden Time here: a similar romantic-themed anime placed in a university setting. For all its flaws, they at least they got that part right, and that made things a lot more real. Perhaps the setting is an unfair point of criticism, but the incredulity of it all was a dampening factor on my enjoyment of this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does this anime do right with the story? For starters, I find its openmindedness towards love quite commendable. Love knows no bounds in this anime: (low-key) incest, lesbianism, lolicon, student-teacher love. Phew! Raunchy stuff. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAverage 2017 animu art. However, one interesting thing about the art is how closely it resembles that of a shoujo anime - the suffocating close-ups, the excessive blushing, the simplistic nature of the backgrounds, fluidity with transitions, etcetera. Unassuming at times, allowing the viewer to focus completely on the trainwreck unfolding in front of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOne redeeming quality of the anime is definitely its music. The one thing you'd expect from the music would be to compliment what you see on screen, as opposed to jarr/seem out of place, and that's what the music did here. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (Minor revelations/spoilers, proceed with caution.)\\n\r\nWith the exception of Ecchan, pretty much everyone is a flake. \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with Hanabi. Supposed \"honour student\", has a thing for her onii-chan. Is fooling around with three different people at the same time in order to numb the pain of unrequitted love. Enjoys playing the victim card, is easily hussled into sex, and doesn't know how she feels 99% of the time about anything.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the emo boy-toy, who has such a bland personality that you wonder what women see in him at all.\\n\\n\r\nThird, we have a piano teacher who loves sleeping with underrage boys. And yet, Mugi the boy-toy enjoys perpetually jerking his little ding-dong to her, despite knowing what a tramp she is. Attraction to someone's looks is apparently called \"true love\" and entitles you to mope around 24/7 and wonder at how deep your life is.   \\n\\n\r\nFourth, we have a loli who is actually just a stuck up little bitch. Also an osananijimi who you know will lose just based the trope she represents.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, there really is nothing likable about any of these characters and you can't really relate to any of them, owing to how bland and pretentious they are. There is no real character development either, apart from little revelations about each ones' true colours, which I don't really consider development.\\n\\n\r\nI can, however, appreciate that this anime has some stellar relationship development. The true strength of Kuzu no Honkai, for me, lies in its character interactions. I keep harping on this, but the roller-coster relationships that characters experience with each other is actually quite realistic, and would have felt a lot more relatable in a university/work life setting.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis anime does not provide an iota of feel-good enjoyability at all. You will feel discomfort, jealousy, cringe, and at times, even disgust. But you'll probably want to keep watching with a grotesque interest that you'd have watching a butcher cutting up a piece of meat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIn the end, Kuzu no Honkai has its good points, but is a painful pill to swallow. Vaguely resembling a B-rate drama, if you derive any more enjoyment out of this than what you'd get from a cheap soap opera, I commend you. \\n\\n\r\nDepending on what parts of this anime you love or hate, you might end up calling this a 2/10 OR an 8/10. I recommend you watch and find out.",

            "content": "\"Kuzu no Honkai\" is the most fucked up show I've seen since \"School days\". Honestly, this show could be a Hit or a miss for most people. For me, fortunately or unfortunately it was big miss. Although I do appreciate the boldness to create and put out something like this this, can't say I'm a fan of it. \r\nThere really isn't much I can appreciate about the anime. It is a cringe-fest of a show with a few okay moments. There isn't much to the story, it isn't very eventful or progressive, it relies heavily on the discovery and the development of the characters, whichin my opinion is it's biggest flaw. There is not a single character I like in this show, Everyone is annoying as fuck and in no way relatable, they're so bland and poorly written, they all just seem like they are different versions of themselves. They are all so fucked up and their actions are so forced and predictable. Their dialogues are so corny and wannabe-deep. When their thoughts are narrated in a first person narrative it is sooo exhausting to even listen to them. Their designs are however not bad and there are a few comic moments that stood out and made them likeable, even if it was for just a moment. \\n\\n\r\nAnother huge flaw are the sex scenes, I don't have any problems with sex scenes but here it's just so forced and over-saturated, like there is a mandatory sex scene in every episode which kinda halts whatever this show is going for and gives us a few minutes of just pure cringe. it is just so uncomfortable to watch their movements and listen to their dialogues. They don't even really have sex, it's just boring to watch. If you're reading this and want to watch this show for this kinda content, I would suggest putting your dick back inside and look for something else lol. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I've seen this show being praised for is it's \"maturity\". Which I strongly disagree, although this anime does seem to have that kind of ambitions, it's stray far away from it or rather comes off as very pseudo-mature. Really, how does a bunch of junior high kids who try to compensate their desires and insecurities through such fucked up pretentious acts come off as mature? It's doesn't, Oh! and don't get me started on the slutty teacher character who does a bunch of crazy things too. It's not mature at all.  \\n\\n\r\nThe three things that I do like very much about this show are the Animation, Soundtrack and Voice acting. I appreciate Lerche studio's effort to tell this mess of a story as cohesive as possible. There is good detail and clarity in the animation which truly deserves praise. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really great too. I really like the OP and ED, the BGM  switches up at times and can come off as very unpredictable, which played a major role in helping me sit through this mess. One of the BGMs has like a Piano tune  kinda similar to Kanye West's \"Runaway\". That was really good, overall, great job with the soundtrack. The voice acting was noticeably great as well. Like I mentioned before, the anime is dark but it does have some comic moments, the voice actors transition so well at times like these, it's so genuine. Props to the voice actors.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, to me it's a frustrating watch and I wouldn't seriously recommend this to anyone. But there is some hype around this show at the moment, and some people do seem to like it for whatever reason so maybe you will too. If you're confused whether to watch it or not, just check out the first episode and maybe the second one too, if it intrigues you then continue, if you feel like I how I did, then just drop it.  \\n\\n\r\nMy rating for this show 3/10.",

            "content": "We think about life as a story. The politician too \u2013 and the gangster. And I would like to believe that both adulterers and the faithful think the same way. Some, perhaps, will make it into a story of triumph. You think, for example, that this isn\u2019t your fate. You have ambitions \u2013 and yet you are being tied down to the Earth \u2013 to this marriage that you chose out of either some bad circumstance or because you were blind in early love. Either way, the adulterer, wishing to be the hero/heroine of the story, will view it as a conquest of the soul.I have to do this, because my life will not be narrowed into such a stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is passion such an old theme? Because love has always been messy \u2013 so they say. I have not touched the Tale of Genji yet \u2013 supposedly the first psychological novel out there \u2013 but I hear that it is a great book on love. From what I know from reading bits and pieces of that Ecchi manga \u2013 Minamoto-kun Monogatari \u2013 it also seems to be a great book on passion and lust (of course, this could be due to the manga\u2019s exaggerations). Love is one of those old themes that has been dealt with everywhere \u2013 in poetry & fiction.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Kuzu no Honkai falls into that tradition. I watched the first 4 episodes, the reactions \u2013 and I also skimmed the manga so I roughly know what happens next. I would say that it is a story about people who like to tell themselves that they are the hero or heroine in their story of love. Hanabi Yasuraoka (whose beautiful voice sends shivers down my spine thanks to the atmosphere combined with the work of Chika Anzai) \u2013 believes that her love is important to the point of self-destruction, and she wishes to escape this pain \u2013 either by achieving it or momentarily placing it in someone else. In this case, Awaya Mugi \u2013 a boy who also suffers from the same crisis.\\n\\n\r\nI think the animation is exquisite. And I\u2019m not just talking about the very very hot sex. The slow pacing mingles with the OST and voice to ensure that you don\u2019t just see the events as mere events \u2013 but you feel them as well. You understand that Hanabi is lovestruck because you see the world in her rose-tinted lenses. And when the bouts of depression or loneliness sinks in \u2013 the atmosphere is heavier and anguished.\\n\\n\r\nBut, as I said \u2013 this is the oldest theme. One of the great examinations of Love in any medium has been pulled off by Woody Allen in his film \u2013 Husbands & Wives. In that film \u2013 there are two couples. The first couple has decided they want to \u2018see separate people\u2019 for a while \u2013 the second couple, their friends \u2013 are shocked by the news. The first couple has been happily married for a long time. So, to the second couple, the fact that so many years still cannot guarantee a constant love \u2013 opens up a massive abyss inside them. They, too, find themselves thinking about seeing other people for once. How everything resolves is surprising, maybe even cynical \u2013 and yet completely naturalistic. And Allen\u2019s work is amazing because he never lets his characters find rest in their own story \u2013 but he always takes the observational point of view to make fun of them. To tell them how small their passions are. He uses his trademark comedy sometimes \u2013 or other times he uses very well-placed \u2018documentary footage\u2019 where various of the characters are \u2018interviewed\u2019 after the end of the story.\\n\\n\r\nGonensei is also a good exploration. It deals with the same theme. It is an extremely bitter manga, but at times it is also a romantic one. I have talked about it before in various places. One very good element is the fact that it hides the lead characters\u2019 flaws in the viewpoints and interactions of other characters. It also has some very good use of flashbacks, to show hints of these flaws.\\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai is beautiful \u2013 aesthetically \u2013 but where does it fall? It talks about the stories of these people. It talks about these stories as though they were the most important things in the world to them. But a dream is a dream to the extent that there is always a reality to return to. And although there may be women who, for example, are truly manipulative and find joy only in manipulation \u2013 and it may be \u2018realistic \u2013 there are larger larger things in the world. I am one of those who tries to keep a restraint on this word \u2013 Realistic \u2013 simply because a lot of things can be possible in real life, and to that extent there are many things that can take the moniker of Realism. But there are many people who will be quick to say that something is e.g. \u2018real as fuck\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019s goddamn real as hell\u2019 \u2013 when it is real in the sense that it parallels to the story that they have playing in their own heads. \\n\\n\r\nIn this world of stories \u2013 and in the world where pattern recognition is a constant thing \u2013 you may always have the urge to pull certain thing you see into yourself. This is one of humanity\u2019s oldest weapons. It is called Empathy. But a problem is that Empathy is born from perspective, which may sometimes be limited in its recognition. A happy person will find Hanabi\u2019s struggle to be less \u2018real as hell\u2019 than a person who has \u2018been through it\u2019. The world is large enough to accommodate both perspectives. Furthermore, a person who has \u2018been through it\u2019 and doesn\u2019t want to deal with it anymore may find Kuzu no Honkai \u2018real as hell\u2019 but they won\u2019t enjoy it because they don\u2019t want to deal with that shit anymore. And there are also those people who haven\u2019t been through it but they have pre-conceived angsty notions of people and think that this is how it all works.\\n\\n\r\nTo the extent that we can feel through these characters \u2013 is a limited place to ask questions. Questions like \u2013 is this a good story? Does it say anything powerfully human? There are some writers who are totally unreal in their writing \u2013 but they capture a kind of mood so well that they get to the essence of something human. Kafka is one of them.\\n\\n\r\nWhat are the questions that the characters of Kuzu no Honkai poses towards us? What is the meaning of violent passion? The primary worldview of Kuzu no Honkai seems to be that it is a beautiful net. You are dragged into it, and the world becomes brighter, but underneath \u2013 it is darker. And there are those who do not wish to be caught \u2013 so they become the catcher instead. This is a violent Darwinian kind of perspective where the primary theme is eat or be eaten. The only way to win is not to play. Later events in the ongoing manga seem to support this \u2018escape from passion\u2019 as the only way out. Is it Buddhist? I have no clue. But this violence of passion is the underlying worldview.\\n\\n\r\nBut, therein lies the problem. It is very easy to write of powerful emotions \u2013 and hard to write about an escape from them. To write about powerful emotions, all you have to do is to invoke emotional extremes. War is an emotional extreme. Backstabbing and adultery are emotional extremes. First love is an emotional extreme. Because they are so extreme \u2013 there are bound to be people who find them \u2018real as hell\u2019 \u2013 because we remember our extremes the clearest, while forgetting that our life is built from these extremes and a thousand other smaller thoughts. A writer with more restraint always finds a way to be gentler, subtler, and more analytical in their treatment of a theme. You can look to Woody Allen\u2019s Manhattan \u2013 for example \u2013 where all these passions and emotions play a part in the work, but it also serves to expand upon the theme of a single person\u2019s idealization of his own life. His idealization of a city and of romantic ambitions. The story he is trapped in and cannot escape from.\\n\\n\r\nTo that extent, Kuzu no Honkai is better as a whirlpool for you to be trapped in. It\u2019s a wave of emotion that just keeps on coming, and it uses all the power of Shoujo romantic art to maximize on the force. But, I think a good story has to show you the waves, and then provide you with a shore to stand on \u2013 to look at the sun.\\n",

            "content": "Love and the sexual feelings we have, lust, are complicated and confusing. Much like my overall thoughts on this anime...\r\nScum's Wish was the  break out hit this season with conflicting opinions all over the place from people praising the show as a masterpiece in which it conveys the themes of romance and love in a realistic manner and those who say that it is over glorified and unrealistic. If you were to ask me, I'd say this anime is pretty stupid, and for the longest time I couldn't decided what this anime was going for exactly nor of what to make of it! Ithonestly feels like, in a lot of places, it is the second coming of School Days!\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem I had with this show was its lack of any interesting characters at all, but before I get into that, let's discuss the plot for this show:\\n\r\nScum's Wish may seem like your typical romance show, but the two main characters who are in a relationship with each other, in fact, do not love each other at all, and lust for different people. Hanabi loves her Onii-chan and Mugi loves his sensei. As the show goes along the two characters begin to bond together, as they begin to form a real relationship whilst trying to come to grips with their unrequited love, while, at the same time, being horrible, scummy people sleeping around with others and using others to get closer to what they want. The characters constantly fuck each other other (no sexual pun intended.) And that's the main aim of this show; to highlight and showcase people at their absolute worst, who do nothing but sleep around and use people for their own agenda's and goals, but here lies my biggest gripe with the show. I find it so boring.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot does try to do something different, which is commendable in its own right, I found everything to be so lacklustre despite the numerous, and rather off-putting sex scenes in the show. I would go as far as to call this show a deconstruction but not a very good one since I don't care at all with what is happening with any of the characters since the anime hasn't given me any reason to care for any of them from the start. All of them are pretty much horrible, disgusting people, and I do get that this is the appeal of the show for some, to watch horrible bastards instead of your typical sugar coated anime girls, but at the same time, since the characters are so unlikable and boring, I found their struggles and problems to be entirely pointless! The characters go around in circles and often the scenarios feel forced and often rather trite at times as well! Not only that but this show is filled to the brim of emotional monologues which always came across as being pretentious in my eyes and a cheap way of sounding deep without trying to convey any themes or ideas in a convincing manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty stupid, and end up doing stupid things just to force drama and pad out the episodes. Now, I understand that teenagers do stupid things all of the time, so it would make sense for them to do stupid things, but the amount of times I became annoyed with this show, and face palmed is staggering since there is no catharsis pay off to make light of the dumb decisions they make, and again, I couldn't find investment since the cast was rather dull and one dimensional. The show does present lesbians and bisexuality as well and attempts to present these in a realistic manner, but since not enough time is invested in these ideas they instead feel rather lackluster and are pushed to the side, remaining stagnant with hardly any development. \\n\\n\r\nI've seen some people refer to this anime as being realistic, and while I can't speak for anyone, this, to me, it perhaps one of the most unrealistic romance shows to ever grace the Earth. All of the drama feels rather forced and thus the characters do too. Also, when in real life have you seen a girl lusting after her own brother so badly before? Not in my world anyway...\\n\r\nTo be perfectly fair, they do treat the incest subtext matter with some care and respect and it isn't just reduced to being just some fan service for all of the filthy weebs out there and hell, it even gets a decent amount of development to fuel her love, making it somewhat justified, although it isn't handled nowhere as good as something like Koi Kaze.\\n\\n\r\nEach character also makes it a habit of referring as themselves as awful people, which, while acknowledging the fact that they're, it doesn't change them at all, nor makes them inherently interesting because of this. The show really needed a likable character to latch onto, or someone to care for in order to have made the drama more hard hitting, but what we get is a rather dull, and confusing mess without any sense of direction to go in terms of its characters or story. The whole time while I was watching the show, I just felt uncomfortable and the whole show feels trashy, hiding behind the disguise of an emotional drama. It honestly does feel just like School Days in many regards. Now, I'm not someone who thinks School Days was the worst anime of all time, far from it in fact, but it attempts to do the same thing as Scum's Wish - that being a deconstruction of the harem/romance genre while presenting drama and dirt bag characters, and it suffers from the same problem. Since the characters are only presented as being such, it's hard to latch onto them and feel for anything they go through since the show is nothing more than a deconstruction and believes that is enough by itself to carry the show, which it isn't at all. At the very least we get to see all of the cunts die at the end of School Days...if only that would've happened here. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I have to say, Scum's Wish has a great visual aesthetic, with great character designs and even some experimental animation to convey the emotional instability the characters are feeling, and the sex scenes, while awkward to watch since they hardly add anything onto the characters, are well very well animated; as well as the music. The opening theme was great and there is a great variety of music in the show to fit the correct moods, definitely the strong points of the show. The voice actors also do a pretty great job at conveying the emotions of their characters and they do feel pretty convincing as well. I also liked the rectangular boxes that would appear on the screen that cut to close-ups of the characters faces which was a subtle touch at presenting their emotions without relying on forced exposition, and this was a nice addition in terms of visual appeal. \\n\\n\r\nBut, when it comes down to it, if we strip these elements all we have is a boring deconstruction with pretentious excuses for deep characters. I do appreciate that the show is trying to do something different, but sometimes, different is not always better. I honestly really wanted to like Scum's Wish, I really did, but the lack of any interesting characters combine that with the fact that I hated every second of it, makes me never want to touch this anime ever again.",

            "content": "Desire is the cause of misfortune in teenage relationships. After realizing that the love of her life has his eyes on another woman, Hanabi Yasuraoka resolves to fill the gaping hole in her heart. The desperate girl didn\u2019t know what to do, but fate is kind enough to grant her a chance encounter with Mugi Awaya, a boy from her school facing a similar romantic dilemma. Finally acknowledging the futility of her original goal, Hanabi decides to form a deal with Mugi: the two would enter a fake relationship, granting them the peace of mind they longingly seek under\u00a0the pretense of false love.\r\nThis is thestory of Scum\u2019s Wish, an emotional yet flawed romance drama that explores teenage carnal desires through multiple love triangles, artsy shots, and gratuitous amounts of erotic sequences.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s uncommon to begin a review with an assessment of the soundtrack, but not doing so would be a disservice to Scum\u2019s Wish excellent music. Comprising a variety of melancholy piano tracks, the soundtrack of Scum\u2019s Wish does wonders in heightening the emotional impact of the show. Masaru Yokoyama is no stranger to composing music for anime, but his work in Scum\u2019s Wish places him in a whole new level. To be frank, the countless love scenes sprinkled throughout the show would feel like clips of softcore porn without Yokoyama's passionate tunes to heighten their intensity. I dare say that the soundtrack of Scum\u2019s Wish rivals that of Masaomi Andou\u2019s earlier work, White Album 2, and that series was largely about the music.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals of Scum\u2019s Wish are simply gorgeous. The backdrops and lighting are great, but the real winner here is the commendable choice of color. Although the show harbors a dark tone, Studio Lerche didn\u2019t shy away from making Scum\u2019s Wish a surreal experience by filling it with beautiful colors. Another thing worth mentioning are the character designs\u2014the cast looks like your standard teenagers and young adults, but attentive viewers will notice that some characters have particularly bright irises which are most noticeable during the sex scenes. This could simply be an artistic choice, but it does heighten emotions whenever the characters experience romantic moments. After all, the eyes are windows to the soul, or so they say.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nNow onto something less than stellar\u2014the cast itself. Since Scum\u2019s Wish lacks a concrete storyline, the burden of its entertainment value falls almost entirely on its characters. Do they succeed in strengthening the narrative and giving the story a clear sense of direction? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Although the cast of Scum\u2019s Wish succeeds in that each person in the show bears a unique personality and backstory, there\u2019s also the problem where two of its characters are hardly needed.\\n\\n\r\nAs the protagonist of the show, Hanabi retains the strongest link with the rest of the cast. While most of the other characters are only relevant in their corresponding subplots, Hanabi plays a major role in shaping the development of everyone in the show. Because of this, many will likely identify Hanabi as their favorite character in Scum\u2019s Wish. Mugi might be the man of the relationship, but as the show goes on, his stoic fa\u00e7ade gradually fades away to reveal his more helpless side. Although he gives off the impression of a tough character at first, such is not the case whenever memories of his longtime crush come back to haunt him. Scum\u2019s Wish does a fine job in crossing the shackles of stereotypes and adding an extra layer of depth for its two main leads, making their development rather unpredictable.\\n\\n\r\nThe devious Akane and simpleminded Kanai will likely receive the ire of most viewers, but this too is a ploy executed brilliantly by the show. Akane\u2019s existence as a one-sided vamp is excessively infuriating at first, but think again: is it possible for a woman in real life to bear a personality like her? Certainly so, and they\u2019re not exactly uncommon either. Likewise, it\u2019s also possible for a man to be so blinded by love like Kanai that rational thinking seems to no longer exist within him. If anything, these two characters demonstrate to us well that falling in love can be a messy experience.\\n\\n\r\nThen come Sanae and Noriko. All the above-mentioned characters have their own set of faults, traits, and stories that make them entertaining and realistic, but unfortunately, the same can\u2019t be said for these two girls. Although Sanae isn\u2019t exactly unlikable, her lesbian relationship with Hanabi feels like a shoehorned attempt to stuff more plot threads into the show. I welcome the occasional yuri, but what\u2019s the point when all it does is introduce needless melodrama? Not only that, but the relationship between Sanae and Hanabi travels nowhere. With the show already facing difficulty in handling multiple love triangles, it seems quite cumbersome for a third unconventional relationship to be thrown in for the sake of expanding the story. Speaking of the second love triangle, the tension between Noriko, Mugi, and Hanabi is the weakest aspect of Scum\u2019s Wish, especially since Noriko is given measly screen time comparing to the rest of the cast.\u00a0Both Noriko and Sanae can be removed from the show and it wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of direction, Scum\u2019s Wish utilizes plenty of artistic shots that involve shading the screen and stressing quotes from the characters in a form of unique display. While some might find these a bit pretentious, I find them to complement the show\u2019s malevolent tone nicely. Another exaggerated trend is the copious amount of sex scenes between the characters. Sometimes I feel the writers stuffed in these sequences mainly for fanservice, but as the show progresses, I slowly accept them to be part of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSo is Scum\u2019s Wish a perfect romance drama? Not by a long stretch, but it\u2019s undoubtedly entertaining because of its distinctive characters. There are several areas that could use some improvement, and some of the superfluous relationships could be trimmed out. In the end, however, I admit that watching these characters trying to overcome their romantic ordeals was a time well-spent.",

As the show progresses you'll gain insights to all of the main characters history, back-stories and struggles but the spotlight would always be on Mugi and Hanabi. I think the show did a great job exploring each of the main characters as well as the supporting ones, and the story were fairly fleshed out. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, If the show is memorable then what is the secret behind it? Well, it's one of the worst kept secret but we often overlook - Soundtracks - The opening (96neko - Uso no Hibana) and the ending (Sayuri - Heikousen) left quite an overwhelming impression on me. Listening to the soundtrack on my HiFi Headphone is extremely satisfying as it invokes your emotion and gravitates you slowly into the story, especially at the end of each episode; the timely play of guitar plucking softly behind the background while the narration was wrapping up as it slowly transition to the epic OST.\\n\\n\r\nAh of course, do not forget the Art. Clean, appealing, colorful and contemporary. I admit, it exceeded my expectation that the anime's art would be equal or less than manga. For a normal bloke like me, I'm thankful they did not sacrifice the quality of the drawings which in a way, contributed to bringing the manga to life. Moreover, I'm satisfied with the voice actors & actresses performances that further heighten the enjoyability of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAt long last, the brilliant drawings & art, mesmerising soundtrack and sensible plot makes it one of the most memorable romance show that I had in recent memory. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it might not be a happy ending for all, but for those who appreciate a great drama and different perspective of 'Romance' makes the immersive experience worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\\n\r\nTL;Dr - Definitely a Must-Watch show for those who is a sucker for 'romance' tag like me and it lives up to its tag. The only thing is, it's not your every day romance kind of show, as it caters to the more mature audience.",

            "content": "Kuzu no Honkai and the praise it's receiving is an example of the weird idea that eroticism is only allowed as long as everyone is miserable. Read: 'realism.' \r\nThe main problem with the anime is that it's seemingly supposed to be a character driven story: we get quite a bit of internal monologue detailing the emotions, feeling and motives of the various characters. The problem is that the writing is suspect. Characters will often repeat the same thing over and over again in slightly different, or unnecessarily abstract ways. It's as if the writers have a large vocabulary but not enough, or any new, ideasto apply it to.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are pretty one-note. Hanabi is cute and all, but if you asked me what she was like I'd only to be able to repeat the synopsis of the anime back to you. This idea goes back to the 'realism' thing. Most people don't go throughout their daily lives only thinking of the one problem that's plaguing them. Even if there was one person that did that, I think it's highly unlikely that there's an entire group of people around them doing the exact same thing. 'Characters' and 'character development' are often used as a  free pass when someone likes something about a character but doesn't know exactly why or how to express it, which is why I'd rather talk about something else than focus on that. But in this case, where the show is being praised for its realism, I must say that characters that don't seem at all like living human persons doesn't strike me as realistic. Give Hanabi a hobby or something, I'm not asking for much. \\n\\n\r\n\"But they're unhappy so of course it's realistic.\" \\n\r\n\"But they're unhappy so it's mature.\"\\n\r\n\"But they're unhappy so it's deep.\" \\n\\n\r\nor\\n\\n\r\n\"But they had sex so it's realistic\"\\n\r\netc. \\n\\n\r\nI don't buy it. Making me care about these characters is like 'creating engaging drama 101.' If I don't care about them why should I be shocked by what is going on around them? This creates an emotional gulf where I kind of want to see what's going to happen, but I don't have to worry about any surprises along the way. In a way it's a good thing because it cuts down on stress, but that doesn't help make the anime engaging on any level that isn't superficial. \\n\\n\r\nI did like the visuals and the character designs however. I felt that the visual design and direction was consistent throughout: it was engaging and descriptive enough to keep my eyes happy. This may be the case of the studio dealing with a flawed source, because they got the mood right... but it's a story that wasn't interesting enough, or maybe even just poorly focused. \\n\\n\r\nThe last episode contained the most characterization and charm out of any of them. Hell, the ending was way more reasonable than it deserved to be.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the sex: novel at first, event that's a stretch, but got boring quick. Some people watching were too easily impressed by the 'they kissed in the first episode' thing and that's how they got hooked, I'm guessing. \\n",

            "content": "Beautifully melancholic, and deeply thought-provoking. \r\nKuzu no Honkai \u2013 most people will either love it or hate it, since it\u2019s definitely a polarizing anime to say the least. Personally, I\u2019m in love. Here\u2019s why:\r\n(Please note that this review only reflects my opinions of the show up till episode 4, as it is when I am writing it.) \r\nStory \u2013 (10)\r\nIf you\u2019re going into this anime expecting a straight-forward, innocent romance \u2013 don\u2019t. The premise is nothing special and is well summed by a few lines in the synopsis. However, the execution is what makes it really shine through amongst other \u201cromance\u201d anime\u2019s.  Most ofthe story is told through memories and thoughts of characters, and is specially written to invoke thought into the viewer. The story focuses heavily on the physical side of love rather than the emotional side which other anime\u2019s tend to do. Recurring themes throughout the anime are loneliness, emptiness and guilt, which are are used to contrast the story\u2019s dark portrayals of desires and lust to great effect. With that said, I really appreciate the more \u201cintimate\u201d scenes in this anime as they are not there just for the sake of being there . They effectively serve as a storytelling tool to provide us with more insight in the minds of the characters, and the unsettling side of human desires. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point, if you have not interested in the story whatsoever \u2013 I can confidently say you will not enjoy this series. But if you find this take on romance interesting, please read on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 (9)\\n\r\nGraciously monotone.  In general, the animation and style throughout is very consistent and always enhances the feelings the particular scene is trying to create. The heavy use of imagery and shifts in tones are also things that really stand out to me.  Another noteworthy feature is how the different types of framing (literally the diameter of the screen) and the use of comic panels, oddly enough; add to the dramatic effect of the scenes in a way that is elegantly done. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 (8)\\n\r\nWhat can I say? I am absolutely in love with the opening and closing of this anime \u2013 it sets the mood just right, before, and even after the anime. The repetitive use of silence is a clever move, as it helps to bring out the sense of loneliness and emptiness which greatly contrast the story. Due to this, when it needs to, even the slightest dramatic sound effect is amplified significantly due to the silence that trails it. However, the sound in some scenes are too typical and don\u2019t really add much to the scene. But in general, it was handled pretty well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 (7)\\n\r\nI\u2019m certain that this score will increase as the series goes on. We as the viewer gradually learn more about each character with every passing episode when their layers start to peel off. I hope the characters will be fully developed by the time this series comes to a close. But for now, most of the characters are decently well developed, and we more or less have acquired a glimpse of their past through through each one of their eyes by the end of Episode 4. The majority of the characters are interesting in their own way, and really have to be experienced rather than described by me. With that said, this series has solid characters, although some require more development to work. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 (10)\\n\r\nComing someone who appreciates darker themes in anime, I can say that this series really executes it to my liking; I enjoyed every second of this series so far and certainly hope it continues down this path. Although, I can see why others might not enjoy this anime too. For one, the characters aren\u2019t really the best people \u2013 sure they might be compelling, but they are far from innocent. Secondly, the dark themes of this anime might leave certain viewers in an uneasy state which would make it far from enjoyable if they were looking for a typical high school romance. Nonetheless, this is my type of anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 (9)\\n\r\nIt is a great pleasure watching a series that is so self-aware of its core message \u2013 and has proven to what extent it will go to convey it. Kuzu no Honkai is not a perfect anime, but is certainly worth taking a look at. \\n\\n\r\nI am patiently waiting for the next episode\u2026 :) \\n\\n",

            "content": "I just finished binge watching Kuzu no Honkai.  I watched the whole season in just under 24 hours.  Once I started watching it, I just found it nearly impossible to stop.  Considering that I work full time, I had to force myself to sleep at nearly 3 am and watch the rest of the season after work.  This show had been hailed by many as the best of the spring season, and I will admit, it is a shame that I put it off until now.  However, I also am glad that I did, because it would have killed meto watch it week by week and have to wait 6 or 7 days between episodes.  This is a very adult anime about relationships, which deals with the idea of putting on a mask for people which conceals the psychological inner turmoil going on beneath the surface.\\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai is about love in a way that no other anime I have ever seen has portrayed.  It is about desire, jealousy, trying to fill the inner void, and unrequited love.  The art is amazing, the same quality most of the time as anime movies.  The Intro and Ending songs are both really good and I will have them in my head for a while I'm sure.  The background music was also very good and never felt out of place for the emotions or story at hand.  The story was unique and captivating, it had me on the edge of my seat most of the time, wondering what would happen next.  Most anime have a love triangle or something else with a few character, but in this story, it's layer upon layer of love.  Some are reciprocated, others are left with only their desire.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters in Kuzu no Honkai are not flat.  Each one of them is far deeper than most characters in every anime I've ever seen.  It's one thing to say that you love someone, but are you truly willing to accept them for who they are, or are you only hoping for some ideal version of them which only exists in your mind.  In this story, there are characters who are willing to even accept the one they love being with other lovers, just so long as they can also be with them.  No one is perfect, and Kuzu no Honkai shows some good examples of characters who are willing to love and accept another character despite knowing how broken and fragile they are inside.\\n\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed the entire series from start to finish.  I feel like looking back, people will see this show as the best show of the year, in terms of being groundbreaking and setting a new standard for what a romance story not only can but should explore.  Instead of making a 1 dimensional story which repeats what other shows have done with the same anime tropes we see in every anime, we deserve more.  Kuzu no Honkai gives us truly fleshed out characters which seem almost real.  They have honest looks into their feelings and face their fears head on.  I highly suggest this show to any adult anime fan.  You will thank yourself for spending the time to complete it.  I rate all aspects of the show 10/10 and I look forward to more romances like this in the future.",

            "content": "I begin by apologizing because English is not my native language, so excuse the mistakes.\r\nKuzu no Honkai has a serious theme being addressed, the sentimental and sexual discovery of several characters. The big problem was being appealion and unrealistic. I believe that this was the author's intention, since it is normal for Westerners to have fetishes for characters of animes living in embarrassing situations but ... some situations border on ridicule. With the exclusion of the protagonist, all the characters are extremely extereotipados which makes very clear the reasons behind each action eliminating the chances of good twists.\r\nStory (3) : History has a rich themeto be addressed if it were not treated with so much exaggeration and unreality.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7) : Good Character Design and ambientation.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5) : Decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (1) :  Here I am going to do my editing. These are not just stereotypes. The protagonist is really empty. No matter how much the plot attempts to push feelings, she simply does not match. It becomes comic as every drama boils down to an ending in sex. There are no reasons, background or a simple explanation. She is sad and so will make sex with the first camel to appear.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters I have to say, the teacher (woman) is all that saves the plot. She has a background story infinitely better than the story told to the protagonist even being addressed in so few episodes. All other characters I keep what I said, are just stereotyped versions of other anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1) : Very painful to watch this work until the end. Still I believe that many watch waiting for the best, a clich\u00e9 ending where everything ends well. But I fear the turnaround will be even more disappointing than anything that has ever been shown.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI will check this review after the conclusion of the anime to see if I paid the language or hit the author's intentions.",

            "content": "Hating a character is quite an easy feat, loving a character is the same thing because their relatable or awesome. However HATING a character because their relatable is something entirely different.\r\nDue to how character-relational focused this kind of anime is, LA will be diving into the spiraling chaotic characters relationships and the characters themselves in much more detail. Let's start with one of our main protagonist, Hanabi Yasuraoka voiced by Chika Anzai, who has unrequited love towards Narumi Kanai voiced by Kenji Nojima, a childhood friend and teacher towards Hanabi, however because of that, she has a \"fake\" relationship with Mugi Awaya voiced by NobunagaShimazaki in order to fill her loneliness, also add in Sanae Ebato voiced by Haruka Tomatsu another friend of Hanabi who wants her friendship to be something even more \"special\". Mugi also has unrequited love towards Akane Minagawa voiced by Aki Toyosaki another teacher at their school who has a \"relationship with Narumi\" thus what caused Mugi and Hanabi to form their fake relationship, also add in Noriko Kamomebata voiced by Shiori Izawa a childhood friend who had a crush on Mugi. \\n\\n\r\nIf the relationships is anything to go by it's a VERY complicated love dodecahedron and it gets even more complicated in the web of chaos of relationships and the characters goes through love corrupt and some redeem in their exploits. Hanabi and Mugi if anything goes through the most change from their unrequited love and although they dive into the corruption and self-destruction of unrequited love they also goes through the ACCEPTANCE of unrequited love. (Albeit Hanabi goes through a more natural one, Mugi's however slipped into it). Yes, they are horrible hormonal characters, but for being a teenager, hasn't people ALSO done some dumb mistakes when it came to love?...let alone unrequited, because of this and why Hanabi and Mugi were relatable in the sense they go through the stages of unrequited love, because of that, Hanabi was LA's favourite character and probably LA's favourite character of Winter 2017. Mugi if anything goes through something similar albeit in the more corrupted and naive sense than what Hanabi went through and really by the end of the anime, LA still kinda wanted Hanabi and Mugi to be together, if love corrupts, why not do it towards the character who does the same thing?. Sanae's character development is bringing in something of a forbidden love towards Hanabi (as well as itching LA's yuri in the more extreme yet mature sense) and because of that, LA also kinda wanted Hanabi and Sanae to be together as well but seriously, their relationship development gives one of the more visceral take on the unrequited love let alone forbidden yuri one. Akane Minagawa is one of the more interesting character in the anime, mainly because she's the closest to the \"villain\" of this anime, this is because she is the more unemphatic, sadistic and fueled by greed of sex when coming to love and sure LA will say the obvious, she is portrayed as a bitch, but as LA said, she's one of the most interesting character of the series as she is very much relatable to Hanabi as she's what would of happened if Hanabi went down with her corruption of unrequited love, thus as much as she's a manipulative bitch, she is definitely one of the more unique characters in the anime and she quickly became LA's second favourite character of anime, yeah odd isn't it?. Finally we need to talk to Narumi Kanai and Noriko Kamomebata, these two characters are essentially the puppy naive love to their respective love interests. Noriko emphasizes what happens if your childhood friend crush and her moe tendencies were taken to it's more darker roots and she maybe pure like Akane Minagawa \"was\"...but she too is corrupt in some ways. Narumi is probably the ONLY pure one here in this anime and because of that...he's the most naive of the characters and he plays off the \"nice guy\" in a depressingly dark romance anime he's in.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this character-relational analysis LA is saying towards all this is, is that these characters are unique and the \"most\" are assholes or horrible towards one another but this anime is \"exotic\" in it's topic issues, not for everyone especially for those just wanting to see a typical romance anime, but it can strike to some people who can relate to these characters and see what happens when these characters goes to the depressingly extreme when it comes to unrequited love and seriously, the majority of people has experienced before, LA being one of them who been and LA could just relate to Hanabi and even more to Akane because even if Akane is unemphatic when it comes to love for the pleasure of it, LA is unemphatic about love due to being burned by rejection, slightly different circumstance sure, but LA can relate to her if anything.\\n\\n\r\nIs Kuzu no Honkai a deconstruction of the unrequited love genre?...no. It's a much more tainted, darker look at what happens with unrequited love and how people self-destruct or redeem themselves from their corruption of unrequited love. Hell the anime is called SCUM'S WISH, LA doesn't think it's trying to hide anything!, it is a dark and depressing anime and just because it IS, doesn't make it bad or anything but perspective if anything if you just want to see \"happy\" romance or to see something different and takes the risks especially in the darker direction of the romance genre.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Lerche is definitely an exotic stylistic choice. The character designs are polished and detailed all throughout the anime sure but they convey this light novel/manga feel to it and it's even portrayed in it's stylistic choice from it's split screen allowing for the more emotionally destructive expressions, sure the split screen it has times where it just uses is excessively but when it does use it correctly it does. The backgrounding and the detailed light novel/manga stills are just gorgeous to look at. The animation is detailed and very much have exotic animation and LA really liked the animation style choice....-sigh- yes even in some of the PG-13 sex scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOn speaking of which, the fanservice, yes the PG-13 sex scenes can be awkward in many ways and the fanservice is excessive in many ways from the nearly there boobs and ass to the explicit \"yes they are doing it\" but not showing it all the way kind of way. Ohh and this is gonna be obvious, but the characters has soo many times when they do it. Here's the thing, as much as the fanservice is excessive, the anime doesn't entirely focus on the fanservice as it's much more on the character's emotional expressions and their sexual implications to it.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice cast, this voice cast is astounding! Let's talk about Chika Anzai? There is just something about Chika Anzai's natural cadence that just makes her role as Hanabi much more natural than the other characters, sure the other voice cast does excellently here, but LA heavily thinks that Chika Anzai learned ALOT from her role as Reina from Hibike Euphonium (or through Tomoyo Kurosawa or Youta Tsuruoka the sound director for Hibike Euphonium what have you...) that just makes her sound more natural and \"real\" when she just speaks and it just resonates so much with LA. For obvious reasons Chika Anzai is LA's favourite voice actor in Scum's Wish AND favourite voice actor of Winter 2017 and rightfully so. LA will also give props to Aki Toyosaki in voicing such a visceral performance as Akane and again her voicing a playing against the type character and LA just loved Aki Toyosaki. The rest of the voice cast did great, giving off the same level of cadence as Aki and Chika did. This voice cast is just amazing there's not much else to say.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending, if anything brought on a rather depressing yet emotionally visceral ending especially in how many of the characters were brought on by their resolutions, the major focus going to Hanabi and Mugi as well as their \"fake\" relationship was brought up again. LA says depressing all due to their resolution of finding true love and how it affects Hanabi and Mugi and it can be visceral both character-wise and relatability to those STILL trying to find true love. Nonetheless as much as this ending has some charmingly happy notes, it ultimately ends in a sad state that the characters can't easily change.\\n\\n\r\nYes, LA is praising the hell out of this anime and this statement too is gonna be obvious but Kuzu no Honkai was LA's favourite anime of Winter 2017 being completely honest. (Kuzu no Honkai did have a HUGE competition with Youjo Senki in the earliest weeks of Winter 2017 for first place though). LA doesn't care if the characters are horrible and hormonal because they can be very relatable thus LA can't really fault these characters because seriously, hormonal teenagers makes dumb mistakes all the time especially from something as complicated and depressing as love let alone unrequited.\\n",

            "content": "Even after I've become more experienced with the medium, I do have na\u00efve expectations at times. Kuzu no Honkai comes with a promise of adolescent sexuality and a messed up affair web to present and explore. Only to become more and more overbearing with it to the point where it's a schlocky softcore porn soap opera. And it is a soap opera by all means. If that is refreshing in anime form, go right ahead and enjoy the show. But to me, this is an example of why a lot of teen dramas flop hard.  \r\nOne of the biggest praises Kuzu gets ishow \"realistic\" it feels. When in terms of presentation it is absolutely groundless. There isn't much one can discern in terms of context and situations, only how it matter to the character's current emotional state. The series is actually very stream of consciousness oriented, yet it sticks to a conventional slice of life setting, with schools and walkways. I have no idea what's going on outside the characters' love affairs, how they're lagging behind on school, how their parents try to communicate about their problems. How seemingly no one reports suspicious activities of our villain - a school teach going on dates and hotels with her students.  \\n\\n\r\nThe events are framed as shocking, but due to the lack of grit to the setting, it's like someone trying to bite you without any teeth. At times it feels like softcore porn, yet it's doing its damnedest to make you feel uncomfortable during the sexual scenes, instead of portraying lust, addiction. And then quickly dials down so we can go back to the painfully podcast long monologues of each character in the cast of 6. How the hell do 6 people get into such toxic affairs with each other is a logistical miracle. And each one feels the same, it's the exact same style of circular reasoning, just insert a motive and an emotion for the episode and call it \"character development\" which comes out of nowhere, isn't properly foreshadowed and only relevant for the current episode. The overarching theme of unrequited love is immensely diluted to where it's just emotional ranting, railroading itself into disasters for the sake of it. Flashbacks only provide emotional context, but not the situational one, how a character's behavior has come to be, who they are as a daily person. I ultimately don't know any of these people, and I don't care about what happens to them, or what they have to say.  \\n\r\nAny character at any any time can come up with any reason to do what the author decides for them to do. Because all you have is the raw emotional reasoning and nothing else. And suspiciously so, all of it is laid bare in such a clear fashion, you can follow the train of thought in a cohesive manner, it never devolves into rambling or just partial words. Leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination, to grasp for an an essence of thought that alludes to the mental impact of what the characters are experiencing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow to get a into a few details, the \"relatable\" characters.  \\n\r\nHanabi, the poster child of a teen making dumb romantic decisions. Only to be dragged or dragging herself into bad situations because she thought it would serve her best. The initial idea of her unrequited love was to explore what it's like, yet later on that falls flat and feels like stalled development. She is never truly faced with the hard realities of sexual encounters and how lust \"corrupts\" one's mind. She's a \"pure\" waifu from start to finish. She tries to emulate the villain in a half-hearted manner, yet nothing comes of it. The series never truly commits to its supposed scumminess.  \\n\\n\r\nMugi is the passive male deuteragonist. A rather passive person with sexual experience who also has unrequited love for the villain. But a lot of the time he's just that, non-reactive, he's merely there to add to the roster and doesn't do much by himself, yet we hear his emo thoughts regardless. He might as well not exists to my mind because he's just a crossroad for the love affair web.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd now we get to the villain, the sociopathic Akane. Her initial role as a foil to Hanabi falls flat with her own dedicated episodes of development, which gradually invalidates her entire character, role and concept.\\n\r\nEcchan is in a similar spot as another extension of the misery train. Her actions escalate without warning, and little reprehension. In a lot of ways, she could've served the show in a great thematic manner, but in the end her inclusion just extends the show needlessly.\\n\r\nMoca is a himedere (i.e has a princess complex) serving comic relief that was thankfully written out most of the anime.\\n\r\nAnd lastly Kanai. He's a plot device and the most shamelessly stereotypical character of the cast, and that's the point of his existence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art direction is on point though, as coming from a director who specializes in interpersonal romantic melodramas. The softer water color backgrounds, the soft character lines work well to bring some discomfort to the series, how surreal it is. And during monologues or dramatic scenes, the directing is up for color filters, shading the frame, tilting it. Heck, there are outright esoteric scenes during some monologues with rose petals, it's actually quite tasteful. The focus on the faces, even the panel framing works wonders. Though at times the panels feels cheap, the directing overall does its damnedest to elevate the fanfiction level melodrama into something sensational. And the sex scenes are handled as well as they could be for TV, a lot of cuts and implications, but kept rather \"safe\". This is what makes Kuzu passably enjoyable from a schlock soap opera perspective. Everything is so overbearing at all times that it's all ridiculous after a point, makes for a good laugh.\\n\\n\r\nSound direction follows suit with the cinematography. It's effectively overbearing, the signature sad piano works wonders for the emotionally heavy monologues. And a bit of lighter tracks for the less dramatic conversations. The OP sounds like generic j-pop to be, and while the ED has a godlike transition and initial emo solo, it also devolves into the same pop tact that bleaches away any memory I have of what I just watched.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd thus, with this rant. Kuzu has no redeemable qualities as the effective melodrama it aspires to be. It is utterly groundless, baseless for whatever it wants to show or share in terms of wisdom or perspective. Banking solely on the \"relatability\" of the characters' emotions, since that's all we have really, when it's utterly fruitless to do so. None of it has weight, or meaning to be gained out of it. It's a misery mood piece in a vacuum at best, and it's schlocky softcore porn in its most entertaining. Any allusions to humanity or drama are superficial and superfluous. As a piece of media about \"eroticism\", it is an utter failure. Too timid, never wanting to commit to the dark, disturbing depths of the human unconscious, instead alienating me with flawed, circular reasoning. The only Scum at the end of this road is me.",

            "content": "Kuzu no Honkai or Scum's Wish is a romance/drama anime described by many as the \"dark side of the romance genre\" due to how different it is from most conventional romances out there, given to how heavily focus around the concept of unrequited love and manipulation it is.\r\nSo is safe to say that i was rather interested, to say the least, in what this series had to offer. However as the story moved along i couldn\u2019t look pass how much of a huge mess this show turn out to be for reasons that will be specifying below.\r\nAs you would probably expect this review may containsome minor spoilers so bear that in mind while reading it.\\n\\n\r\n__________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nStory (3/10): The story revolves around two high school students that have hopeless crushes on people that they cannot have given the age gap, so they started dating each other to soothe their loneliness.\\n\r\nLike i stated previously the whole concept is indeed rather unique yes, but the ideas were not well crafted. Everything felt very exaggerated.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of building an actual romantic relationship most of the time is spent focus on either having a character monologue or the characters getting intimate with one another. There was never an actual moment where the interactions between the two main characters felt genuine, and the fact that they both suddenly started to grow feeling for each other about midway through the series when their relationship up until that point was solely nothing more than just physical seriously came out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nIt uses solitude as a cheap excuse for everything and tries build a romance under this notion, which ultimately fails miserably in that regard consequently making most of the characters to look like they have absolutely zero autonomy and self-esteem.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2/10): The worst part about this series has definitely to be the characters. All of them lack any sort of moral compasses and spend most of the time questioning their selfish actions rather than trying to improve themselves. Some people may say that this is one of Kuzu no Honkai biggest strengths however i completely disagree. Seeing the same group of people constantly making irrational decisions 24/7 just for the sake of drama becomes simply both annoying and frustrating to watch really fast.\\n\\n\r\nThis goes without even mentioning how badly written most of them all were. What do i necessarily mean by this? Well to give an example, let's talk about the so called \"antagonist\" of the story. In episode 4 we got a bit of an understatement behind the antagonist motives and sadistic nature, however by the end of the series all that is completely dismissed in a poor attempt to humanize the character and for the sake of creating, yes you guessed it, more forced drama\u2026 \\n\r\nAnd this is just the tip of the iceberg. We also have it where some characters got introduced for solely one purpose and sake of plot convenience. Since apparently the author must had run out of ideas so she had to bring some random character to resolve everything\u2026\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and Art (8/10): Okay i have to give credit where credit is due, the music and art style is great. The used of manga-style type panels was quite genius and it fitted quite well with the whole theme of the series.\\n\r\n___________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is a complete and utter mess. It lacked direction, the characters were poorly written, it had a predictable plot, the relationships were shallow, and was filled with forced drama.\\n\r\nWould i recommend anyone to go watch Kuzu no Honkai? Quite honestly no. Is no different from any other Teen Drama series out there and shouldn\u2019t be viewed any differently or in such a high standard just because is an anime. If you are into teen dramas that\u2019s fine, but just know you would be better off watching an actual hentai rather than this.\\n",

            "content": "*cracks knuckles* \r\nAlright, time for my first review on here. \r\nFirst off, i just wanna say, the reason i wanted to wait off on reviewing is simply pure laziness, but this one has motivated me. \r\nScum's wish lives up to it's name better than any anime I've seen yet. THEY'RE ALL SCUM AND I HATE EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER.  Now someone might ask, \"why would you watch it then?\"  Well, short answer: I don't really know.   Have you ever watched something or heard something that brought up a really painful memory yet you just couldn't look away?  Well this was thatscenario for me.  \\n\\n\r\n(A tiny bit of background for my case:  I was with a girl for about 3 months, and I was used by her through and through.)\\n\r\nWell good lord, the teacher might as well have been the spitting image of my ex.  A straight up psychotic whore.  (And the other characters are pretty up their in their \"whoryness\")  Every character has some for of sexual instance with (at least) one other character.  \\n\\n\r\nLet me put it this way. \\n\r\n1: They all shoulda just kept it in their pants and everything would have been fine.\\n\r\n2:Don't get into a relationship with someone you don't have feelings for.\\n\r\n3: Don't be in relationship with someone who you know is just gonna do things with others anyway.\\n\r\n4: Don't cheat.\\n\r\n5:Don't cheat.\\n\r\n6: see 4&5.\\n\\n\r\nAm i coming through clear now? One last way to put it. I would punch the guys straight in the face if i could, and, if i was a girl, the same for the girls. (and i'm a pacifist)  All of these characters just piss me off to no end. (and the ending sucked too)\\n\\n\r\nI don't remember where, but i remember someone saying how they loved this anime for it\"s \"realistic approach to love\" or something like that. OK, NEWS FLASH, THAT ISN'T NORMAL, and if it is? I'm sorry for the life that you've been living in honey, cause it shouldn't be remotely like that.  If this kind of thing is normal in your world, you need to get outta there cause that's not healthy, at all.  CHEATING IS NOT OK PERIOD.  If you've found someone else that you like, be a decent person, and end it with the one you're currently with immediately. I repeat, DO NOT CHEAT. DON'T. \\n\\n\r\nRant aside, as a drama, it does it's job. Romance? No. Ecchi? Kinda. Seinen? uhhh, no? if anything i could see this being aimed at girls. \\n\\n\r\nArt style was fine. Ton's of flowers used as backgrounds that landscape the background of the long winded overthinking thoughts scenes.   Nothing special really. \\n\\n\r\nMusic was okay?  It was almost always somber and depressing.  I did enjoy the intro and outro songs though.  (Did not care for the video parts of those. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, i wouldn't really recommend this. Again, I don't even know why i watched it all the way through.  Maybe i just wanted to see them all miserable? Who knows? \\n\r\n(oh, ending was crap too)",

The art,animation and music are standard of most anime today unfortunately that does not make up for the piss poor writing. Let's talk about the emotional ineptness of the characters which only serves to stereotype millennials from the two sixteen-year-oldswho begin to sleep with each other out of desperation to a teacher who actively decided she wants to have an affair with  a male student if it was just these three people having these problems I could believe it or at least suspend my disbelief but no that's not what happens  it devolves into a Spider Web of Lies and bullshit up to the point you find yourself not caring anymore due to the sheer Ridiculousness of the situation and you find yourself only watching to seeing how much farther the rabbit hole it goes down the proverbial sink. These are the reasons why I will not be recommending the show to anyone of course there's more I could talk about in this review such as the complete lack of Parental or employee supervision but I think I've said enough to say this show is awful and at its best is little more than emotional torture porn for teenagers.",

            "content": "Kuzu no Honkai is a show that caught my interest by reading its plot synopsis. However when I actually started watching it, I didn\u2019t expect it to be sexually explicit. From just the first episode, I was already welcomed by scenes that just flash that \u201clewd\u201d sign across the screen. Now, this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve encountered a show that uses this kind of approach in telling a romance story. However, this is my first time seeing a show use a more dark and perverse perspective of exploring love without being labeled as a hentai. It shows a lot of promise to become anactual mature romance story that is unafraid to touch taboo topics. Yet, it turned into a mess that is beyond saving.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with how the two main character\u2019s relationship started. Mugi is in love with his teacher Akane and likewise, Hanabi is in love with her brother-figure Narumi who is also a teacher. Now, the story presents both Mugi and Hanabi\u2019s situation as unrequited love. Since they feel conflicted with their feelings towards their love interest, they decide to form a relationship instead out of frustration. There\u2019s a feeling of void that they want to fill by being in each other\u2019s company and that\u2019s an interesting coping mechanism that I would\u2019ve liked the show to expound further on. Mugi attempts to imagine Hanabi as Akane and also Hanabi attempts to imagine Mugi as Narumi. Seeing this idea quite baffled me at first, as how in the world will they ever achieve that when they\u2019ve never experienced embracing the warmth of their special someone in the first place. However, I interpret this is merely a childish wishful thinking and it\u2019s a shame that the show only leaves it that way and never attempts to change that mindset.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progressed, things got more complicated. It was no longer only about the couple\u2019s dealings of sorting out their feelings by engaging in very sensual mouth play. You thought they were actually having sex? Nope, it got teased so much to a point that it became rather distasteful. So much for the friends with benefits type of story it was going for at the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nThe story started to introduce several subplots that couldn\u2019t be justified within twelve episodes. Akane is not what people think she is under that innocent aura and the show gives her a bit of time under the spotlight, unveiling who she really is. There are also hints of Narumi having feelings for her and the show also dedicates time on how they interact with each other, with a possible sense of development to arise from it. It would\u2019ve been fine if the story stopped at that point in introducing new things to the story, but it wasn\u2019t satisfied and proceeds to introduce more characters that struggle to be relevant within narrative. Here comes Hanabi\u2019s school friend Sanae and Mugi\u2019s childhood friend Moca who both have romantic feelings with their respective friend. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the sudden, the show became about a love web that lost focus on what it really wants to do with its story. Character decisions started to become more irrational as I kept scratching my head what in the hell do they want to achieve. What happened to that interesting premise at the beginning? It slowly sank into a boiling pot of smut ideas, only to be rendered indistinguishable among the rest. \\n\\n\r\nAnother observation I\u2019ve made that turned into something I can\u2019t ignore is that it has too much internal monologues. Yes, they help in expressing thoughts of characters when all actions fail but there must be a limit to how much you can tell without being excessive. It breaks any sense of intimacy the show attempts to emulate with its atmosphere. A sexually explicit story must be able to convey thoughts through body language as well, don\u2019t let all the talking do it. This is especially critical when it comes to foreplay. There has been instances where I can\u2019t get into a scene because the narration always clashes with the suggestive movements, simultaneously doing both of them just makes me lose focus and attention.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of that mess, the show tries to end things in a positive manner which kind of puts me off. If you\u2019re going to delve into the lowest depths of a human being, at least lower yourself all the way through and not ascend on the last minute like an emergency rope pulled you out all of the sudden. It immediately brings up a \u201cPeople can change\u201d clich\u00e9 that felt so out of place. The only explanation I see for doing this is because they are running out of time, leaving all those subplots it laid out unfinished. It\u2019s like everything went back to normal. Feelings were withheld once again and the main duo continues to move on with their lives without any sense of character development at all from those events that unfolded like it was no big deal.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kuzu no Honkai is just a bad case of an unorthodox idea being subjected to a clich\u00e9d yet inconsistent approach in story. I could\u2019ve hated it more, but a part of me tried to understand what it was going for. I could\u2019ve not cared for it at all, but it intrigued me enough to pay attention. I could\u2019ve loved it more if only it had a clearer direction in its story. Such wasted potential but it serves as a lesson that just because you are doing something that no one has dared to in recent memory, doesn\u2019t mean you are excused for butchering your own work and still come off as a good unique anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(Pulls out thesaurus to write an apparent intellectual review as if I am writing the Michelin Guide)...\r\nJust kidding. So working off the presumption that if you're looking at this page you must have at least a minor interest in anime with romantic flavor, let me give you a breakdown different from the dronings of everyone complaining how dark/dramatic/sad it is. I have seen quite a few romantic anime in my time and regardless of how you feel about the theme, this is a breath of fresh air. I will tell you right away that this isn't Ore Monogatari or Sukitte Ii na yo, and thankGod for that. Not that I didn't enjoy those stories, but the endless trope of clueless characters oblivious to their feelings and the feelings of others is exhausting. I'm pretty sure by the age of 7 everyone can fully comprehend things/people they do and do not like. Kuzu no Honkai is not a pleasant ride, and thats why it's so great.\\n\\n\r\nI'm honestly not sure if anyone who didn't to some degree enjoy this has actually ever been in a relationship. Feelings are complicated, and life doesn't just go 'happily ever after' as soon as your feelings are reciprocated. Even good relationships have their problems, and there are going to be significantly more heartbreaks in life than fairy tails. We often forget that in life we experience unrequited love more often that not, and at the end of the day just 'being happy that they're happy' often isn't how we truly feel. The story of Kuzu no Honkai is raw in regard to emotion, thats not to say that it doesn't have its plot holes or poor writing, but the fact that it tackles a side of the human psyche that most ignore is something to be commended. Selfishness and selflessness are often seen as antiparallel, but is that always the case? Is what you want truly what you need, and is what you need good for you? \\n\\n\r\nI won't bore you with recounting a synopsis, you can read that on your own. In regards to the characters, I personally love them. They are borderline despicable the majority of the time, but in truth if everyone could hear your actual thoughts throughout the day would every thought be something that isn't hurtful, rude, or insulting? These characters take the typical anime tropes (e.g. tsundere) and toss them into real life situations. They all have selfish motives, but find ways to redeem themselves through acts they they believe to be self sacrificing. This series depicts how what you want, and what you think your dreams incarnated would be like, may be your worst nightmare. \\n\\n\r\nIn regards to art, it's modern. In regards to sound, ask an audiophile. \\n\\n\r\nIf you couldn't tell I enjoyed it immensely, because it goes so much against the grain of typical romance anime, even if it utilizes cheap ploys to accomplish it. Honestly, my true rating would be somewhere around a 7.8/10, but I am really going to enjoy irritating all the anime 'connoisseurs' by giving it a 9/10.",

Remember that my scores are flipped up so that the trash gets the recognition it deserves.\r\nSo Kuzu no honkai which I renamed to kuzu no pain while watching it just for the amount of headache it gave me.\r\nLets start with the \"STORY\".\r\n First up the setting is fucking retarded and fucked up, if some claims that this is #Relatable I suggest to get some help. That aside the story was clumsy and shallow. It doesn't have a goal, meaning or direction it just shows u the cringy life of super edgy and horny teens. oh I almost forgot the slut rotationit was amazing (not really). Finally I give u one point for actually getting somewhere in the story even thou it was painful and clumsy the show actually stumbled (probably accidentally) into different point than it started from. (yes this is rare for trash anime)\\n\\n\r\nArt...\\n\r\nWell nothing special here the art was okayish in every sense for the budget which was probably already used up to make the story so \"emotional\".\\n\\n\r\nSounds. \\n\r\nFor Sounds I'm giving actually quite high rating compared to other stuff simply because the opening is so damn good. Even the regular soundtrack fits with the show and makes the supposed impact scenes atleast somewhat bearable. Too bad that the story fucked it up.\\n\r\nalso the ED sounds like it was done after taking little bit too much LSD hence the 2 and not 1.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. OWO\\n\r\nI'm amazed how they succeeded in making characters so shallow and unrealistic in romance anime like dafoq... the so said \"characters\" are completely retarded like no normal human would even dream of the things they can make without thinking for a second. Characters really fucked up on the story aswell, but it's about the complete product. I'll give it one good thing thou they tried at character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nNONE IT WAS ONLY PAIN, I literally had hard time to go 10 seconds without trying to jump out of my window.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nBelongs to the bottom of the garbage can.\\n\\n\r\nI suggest to watch this \\n\r\n1. If you wanna get motivation for suicide\\n\r\n2. If you are super edgy and horny teen\\n\\n",

All of the characters are superficial and unlikeable, the characters are just that -characters. They don't seem real and they aren't fleshed out enoughto understand. \\n\\n\r\nTheres little to no explanation about the feelings directed to characters, especially about the men/boys who like the female character. Its just portrayed as if they fall in love with her because of her vagina. \\n\\n\r\nThe female teacher is definitely the most interesting and she would have been a better antagonist, its interesting watching her perspective on a date compared to onlookers. \\n\\n\r\nBTW the ending to the manga is absolutely terrible WORST ENDING ive ever seen, really hoping that the ending is different in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nFor some reason the person voicing Mugi just doesn't fit with the character at all, and this is all I can think of when theres a scene with Mugi.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty nice to look at especially when it goes into manga style, all in all its nothing special though. And the white strands of hair in all the characters hair really annoys me. \\n\\n\r\nI've found this anime even less enjoyable than the manga with its strange and slow pacing, and HEAVY BREATHING.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason these 'psychological' partly themed anime keep falling flat, another example is Aku no Hana.\\n\\n\r\nJust my advice - Just because a youtube reviewer says this anime is good don't listen to them and change your thoughts because of their opinion.\\n\\n\r\nAm not finding this series enjoyable at all and have decided I will most properly drop it, unless someone tells me the anime ending is different to the mangas.",

            "content": "When i first started watching this anime I'll be honest, I found it almost repulsive.\r\nthe characters pissed me off and the story was unexpected and I guess threw me off guard and I found my self hating the anime as a defence mechanism. \r\nAnd yet...everything else is perfect the visuals, the sound the atmosphere even the voice actors seem perfect for their roles. \r\nI found myself conflicted like this for the next couple of episodes tugging between hating the show and somehow (in some sick twisted way) actually loving it.\r\nThe premise although somewhat unbelievable tends to focus heavily on sex and sexuality as it mainmotif. Having the characters as high school students is more of a generic anime plot setting which is unsurprising given that people need to make money and high school manga/anime sell well. However, I digress. the episodes are filled with heavy themes but never really goes ecchi something that is rare in anime nowadays and is to some extent admirable, the character are \"scum\" as the title describes. They are stupid teenagers trying to figure out who they are and what they desire, which although dramatised is not far from the truth. The anime takes what I expected to be literal trash \"kuzu\" and turned it into one of the only anime that I have watched that has dealt with sex in such a mature way and yet still manages to shock me.  \\n\r\nI doubt many will read this review as it rambles and is more of a marker for me to express my thoughts as the anime and manga continue. I am up to date with the manga and whether it is an actual appreciation of it or just morbid curiosity i will continue to do so.\\n\r\nAs for ratings i don't think I can really give an hones rating as even through all I've said I still don;t know if i can bring myself to like it.... so an 8 will do for now.\\n\r\nIf you've bothered reading this far in good job I guess someone has to right? \\n\r\nI hope that even though this review is more of a broad critic than a full blown review with detail on art sound etc. you'll still find some use and maybe even agree with some of what I have to say although if you completely disagree I couldn't and wouldn't blame you.",

            "content": "Words like 'enjoyed', 'loved', 'satisfied', 'happy' - none of these apply to Kuzu no Honkai / Scum's Wish at all. I'm used to heart warming romance anime, which sometimes cover the darker side of love and what that means, with some sad 'feels', but you usually get a satisfactory outcome. This anime is absolutely the opposite. If heart-warming is how you might describe your usual romance, this was heart-breaking, harrowing, discomforting and genuinely upsetting. It played on my mind for a full 48 hours after I finished it - a clear sign that the plot line, story and characters wormed their way into my skulland were due to stay there until I resolved or came to terms with whatever it was that made the series play on my mind.\\n\\n\r\nNow, putting all of the above on one side, I watched the whole series all at once - no breaks - literally the full anime-watching-binge-monster came out as soon as I started the first episode. Immediately, I was pulled into Hanabi's story, fully empathising, sympathising and living with her character from the get go. The art, animation style and split screens were partly responsible for pulling me in as well as the unusual premise. It was beautifully animated, each character extremely attractive if a bit similar, especially the guys. What I particularly loved about the animation though was that the beautiful soft art style directly contrasted to what is a particularly dark and disturbing story. The juxtaposition of warm spring/ summer scenery, soft lighting, and attractive high schoolers, with the ugly feelings of lust, unrequited love and infatuation, as well as pain, narcissism, and self-loathing just reaffirmed the stark reality of the plot for me.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I think this is what is so great about Kuzu no Honkai. There is nothing paranormal, supernatural or particularly violent about it which makes the anime so disturbing - it's how close to home and familiar it all feels. Those dark, deeply buried, adolescent thoughts that you had all but forgotten coming back and reminding you of times you would rather forget. \\n\\n\r\nI think we all rely on anime to escape sometimes, and a lot of series' will allow you to skip off into the blissful love stories and harems of unreality, leaving us feeling warm, fuzzy and the best sometimes replicate those wonderful feelings of love inside us as we follow the story. This series completely shatters that expectation to pieces and expects us to confront the pain and misery of feeling alone, unloved, jealous and unwanted with the force of a heavy cabinet suddenly crushing your chest under it's weight. \\n\\n\r\nOur main characters in this case, Hanabi and Mugi, mirror each others situations in almost all respects, both have unrequited love for their senseis, Hanabi's 'brother', childhood friend and neighbour Narumi Kanai, and Mugi for his middle school music teacher, now music teacher of their highschool, Akane Minagawa. And it's unfortunate for our main characters, that both of them, on the face of it, seem to be falling in love with each other. So Hanabi and Mugi strike up a relationship for show, and to most others around them, they look like the cliche, attractive popular couple in love, but in actuality using each other as the replacement for their unrequited feelings. They gain physical and emotional comfort from each other, but it increases the pain they actually feel as they cannot be with the ones they truly love. In the process, the two make a pact together: \"you can have everything but my feelings\" and so the twisted love story of scum's wish begins.\\n\\n\r\nI had a view after reading the synopsis and seeing the first episode or so as to how this would go. It wasn't until the serious twist a few episodes in with Akane's character where the story starts to move away from any romantic tropes typical to the genre. This is the first of many shocks that the series delivers, subverting the genre on its head to tell a serious story very much grounded in the reality of adolescent love. \\n\\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that as attractive as the animation is, the series is refreshingly free of fanservice. It manages to portray physical intimacy and sexual tension the characters have for each other without gratuitous nudity. That being said, as a viewer you are pulled into the characters' consciousness at these times so much so that it becomes uncomfortable as you are unwittingly made into a voyeur as the scene progresses. \\n\\n\r\nFor all these reasons I've rated this 9 overall because it's a fantastic interpretation of the true reality of what being in love can mean. I've not seen an anime do romance in this way before, effectively portraying how painful it can be, especially as a teenager taking their first steps into an adult world. I personally felt the ending was fitting considering the choices our protagonists make to get to that point in the story, although I was full of hatred for some of the characters in particular. It won't be for everyone, but if you've ever wondered what might have happened to those poor, underdeveloped and unfortunate side characters in every other romance you've seen, you might want to check this out.",

            "content": "Kuzu no Honkai: Of the best of 2017\r\nWhen I started reading Kuzu no Honkai manga, I loved how Mengo Yokoyari showed the characters and their relationships.\r\nThat's why I got excited when I knew it would have an anime; although then I was afraid thinking that it could be adapted following those nefarious clich\u00e9s that have taken over the industry in recent years. Which, in this case, would have been completely catastrophic.\r\nFor a manga that was not a hentai, showing intimacy in the way it is shown in Kuzu no Honkai was kind of weird. I will not say new, because in the 80s, 90s andbefore, that style was common; However, I will say that I had not seen something similar for a while.\\n\\n\r\nAnd coupled with that audacity, the plot was exquisitely developed with characters that either you loved or hated for their actions and attitudes. But beyond what you felt for them, it was undeniable to see them as real human beings, as people you could find anywhere.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nThere is another point to highlight in this series, his characters always gave the impression of being people who could find you in real life. Human beings that could be in your family, between your friendships or at work; that approach as realistic and raw as life itself was handled impeccably.\\n\\n\r\nAt a time when there are still plenty of series with flat characters, built on clich\u00e9s; see a series that gets so much out of that pattern is undoubtedly a breath of fresh air. Hanabi and Mugi are people with many problems, with many complexes and with difficulties to mature.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here is another key, yes, Hanabi and Mugi are immature high school kids; however, there is a huge difference between them and the average protagonist of the anime series set in high schools.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the common of these characters are presented with exaggerated gestures, shouts every time they speak, insecurity so big that borders on the surreal, and a shield of virginity in the boys that takes them completely out of reality. In Kuzu no Honkai, we are introduced to typical real-life teenagers; people eager to try things and stuck in the middle of an identity crisis, which includes sexual identity.\\n\\n\r\nBut in addition, this series gave us one of the best female characters in the anime of recent years. Yes, I mean nothing more and nothing less than Akane. This teacher at the end of the day was the nucleus and engine of the whole plot. Kuzu no Honkai managed to play with our minds by making us believe that we would see the love story of Hanabi and Mugi; However, in the end it was all about life and development as a person of Akane.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, towards the end of the series, it did not matter what happened with the \"protagonist\" couple; the real end of this anime was the penultimate episode. The rest was simply an extra; that although it could damage everything by forcing things, in the end it did not fall into temptations and the story closed brilliantly, as it developed.\\n\\n\r\nNot for nothing, the best dialogue of that final chapter, and perhaps of the whole series, was neither of Hanabi, nor of Mugi, it was obviously of Akane. Because she had one scene, and less than 1 minute, to steal the show even in the outcome of the story of the protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nI do not want to go deeper because that would imply giving spoilers and I prefer that each of you live the series. This is an anime that every fan of the genre, and every fan of a good story, should see; I assure you that you will not regret doing it. And it probably make you think about some things in life; and above all, on many of the positions that we assume or that we see others assume.\\n\\n\r\nA sublime series on a technical level\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the technical section I can not help but continue to write compliments. A design of first class characters joined a daring animation. That style of using panels as if we were reading a manga I loved it. Above all because we are facing an impeccable adaptation and very faithful  to the original material.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the soundtrack, I will say that one of the things that I will miss most about this series, besides Akane, will be the ending. The Heikousen theme will not be a masterpiece, but it is able to convey the feelings of the series; other is to say that in more than one episode, the end of it linked to the beginning of this song was something sublime to witness.\\n\\n\r\nSayuri did a great job in the interpretation, but it is the director's achievement to have created that powerful combination. Masaomi Ando made true art with this anime. It had been a long time since I fell in love with a management. The rhythm, the editing, the camera handling, everything was impressive; and see the compositions that Ando managed to create only makes me take my hat off his talent. I hope to see his next work soon.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, a brilliant series in all senses, daring in the way of showing the plot; and realistic in the way it presented to ourselves the characters. Totally recommended; 8.5/10.\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nMany years ago, I found myself chatting it up with an attractive woman at a mixer. In talking about our interests and hobbies, it seemed as if a tiny romantic spark existed between us. That is until our conversation went where I didn\u2019t want it to go.\r\n\u201cOh, yea, my boyfriend and I\u2026\u201d\r\nBoom. She dropped the dreaded B-word. That courage I worked up? The flirting I did? Gone in an instant. I didn\u2019t press my luck any further, and, as life would have it, that meet-up was the last time I ever saw her.\r\nIt reaffirmed asimple life lesson: sometimes things just don\u2019t work out. Love (apparently) included. For Kuzu no Honkai, it focuses on this unfortunate detail too. And, luckily, the anime itself doesn\u2019t succumb to this same lesson.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai quickly sets up the stage. Hanabi loves her \u201cbrother\u201d (really her childhood-older-neighbor friend) Narumi. Mugi loves his former tutor Akane. Unfortunately, these students cannot obtain the gazes of their respective loves for various, understandable reasons. So, in desperation, the two share their taboo feelings with one another \u2013 and it only gets more twisted from there.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the anime bends its relationship links into an odd shape. Noriko loves Mugi who loves Akane who faux loves Narumi. Ecchan loves Hanabi who loves Narumi who not-faux loves Akane. Then Hanabi \u201cloves\u201d Mugi and vice versa. Less a love triangle and more a love ladder with flimsy rungs, these connections form the basis of the plot and the subsequent disarray that their plentiful feelings generate.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough \u201cgenerate\u201d is too mechanical a term, for, in Kuzu no Honkai, the anime gives the community what the romance genre lacks all too often in this medium: actual physical intimacy. And not just hand holding. Make-out sessions. Caressing. Hand jobs. Implied sex. Legit sex. With messy love comes messier spit-swapping and fornication, allowing the audience to see a set of physically active, risqu\u00e9 events that translate into purposeful narrative moments.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the characters aren\u2019t on the cusp of knocking boots, they instead take part in a very singular act: mind masturbation. More formally known as the internal monologue, Hanabi and the others deliver their thoughts and their feelings directly to the audience with long-winded, detailed, and personal speeches. The characters do hold dialogues from time to time (especially Hanabi and Mugi), but that almost always comes with the expectation that sexual deviancy will shortly follow.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this structure goes both ways. On the one side, sandwiching the sex between these monologues follows the themes of Kuzu no Honkai itself. These characters experience a loneliness and longing where they don\u2019t share their feelings outright but rather think about them to themselves. As a result, they get across their points with each other through immediate physicality instead. \u201cActions speak louder than words\u201d as the clich\u00e9 goes, so the balance between their exposition and their actions makes for a worthwhile presentation.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other side, the structure remains quite rigid, leading to an uneventful plot. Monologue. Make-out session. Monologue. Almost sex. Monologue. More making out. Monologue. Sex. Monologue. While the audience gets to hear the minds and see the bodies of these characters over and over \u2013 watching them lay bare in every sense of the phrasing \u2013 the lack of experimentation creates this pattern where the anime loses itself to overt sameness.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at Kuzu no Honkai with a wider lens, the anime once again has net negatives and net positives.\\n\\n\r\nNegatively, the story has a tough time nailing down its tone. For instance, almost every comedy bit comes off as unnecessary. The show isn\u2019t meant to be happy or silly if the characters\u2019 struggles and their thoughts are anything to go off of. Yet, in contrast, it can also get way too dramatic. At the end of the day, it\u2019s (mainly) just a bunch of high-school kids going through failed romances. Their love does come from a meaningful place, but it\u2019s not this all-or-nothing catastrophe that everyone involved seems to blow out of proportion.\\n\\n\r\nPositively, the thematic exploration of love\u2019s dirtier edge cannot be denied. For, despite the repetitive structure and the unfocused tone, the characters\u2019 feelings go to dark places, and the words they relay from the recesses of their hearts hit hard. What it means to love. To be loved. Why we love. How we love.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps most importantly, they expound on how love in and of itself isn\u2019t always the answer. Not just because it\u2019s impossible for everyone to always win. But that being alone can give new opportunities or provide different perspectives. That the absence of love is as powerful as its constant presence.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Kuzu no Honkai\u2019s plot, it also misses and delivers on certain key moments.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Hanabi\u2019s reveal of her romantic love for Narumi was too anticlimactic despite the direction of her character and the narrative at large revolving around her unreciprocated feelings. Although, to be fair, that\u2019s somewhat intended as it proves how fruitless this love was from the very beginning and makes way for Mugi\u2019s successful tryst with Akane.\\n\\n\r\nThen, on the opposite end, the ending confidently walks away in bittersweet fashion. Extra emphasis on the \u201cbitter\u201d portion. Hanabi and Mugi bump into each other during the school festival after separating for some time, and, rather than getting back together. They simply talk to each other. No more mind masturbation, no more make-out sessions. Just sincere words between people important to one another. They part ways, possibly forever, leading to a rather morose conclusion. One that fits the story\u2019s intentions and aligns with its overall atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Kuzu no Honkai embodies a timeless proverb: \u201cIt\u2019s better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.\u201d People live to love. That\u2019s true in this story, that has been true in real life, and that will remain true for as long as love has a place in this world.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai puts a lot of effort into showcasing its characters and its key scenes. So much so, in fact, that strict animation often gets lost along the way. A byproduct of the fact that monologues occur left, right, and center throughout the entire season.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, to combat this loss of movement and to elevate its artistry, the anime makes heavy use out of a simple technique: paneling. Many of the show\u2019s shots involve rectangular panels that highlight a character\u2019s current reaction, provide two perspectives simultaneously, or otherwise draw the attention of the viewer to exactly what needs to be seen. While these panels may be relied on a bit too much throughout the season, they not only serve their purpose well but also metaphorically tie back to the characters\u2019 disjointed relationships.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also presents pretty backdrops and a clear affinity for fancier artistic choices. Shots of nature coincide with \u201cnatural\u201d love. Soft, purposeful lighting accentuates most of its scenes. Faded, white edges exist for certain flashback moments. Hyper-detailed profiles of the characters pop up from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, Kuzu no Honkai also incorporates many creative scenes that both express the characters\u2019 thoughts and allow for even more artistry. For instance, past encounters in picture-frame form populate Akane\u2019s mind. A black mirror reflects a deceptive Noriko. Color returns to Hanabi\u2019s memory during a dreary-then-dear moment with Narumi. Again, not a lot of actual animation but a whole lot of impressive artistry.\\n\\n\r\nIn similar fashion, the characters\u2019 designs are each attractive. Be it their simplicity or striking eyes, the anime makes it tough to deny their beauty or handsomeness. (Also, a small shout-out goes to Ecchan\u2019s meta-reference hat that reads \u201cScum\u2019s Wish.\u201d)\\n\\n\r\nAnd one would be remiss in ignoring Kuzu no Honkai\u2019s deliberate attention paid to its plethora of sex-related moments. It loves its up-close mouth shots whenever characters start to wrestle tongues, and, as for the sex, static images of Ecchan and Hanabi naked and caressing one another or Akane making several flushed facial expressions \u2013 in full- and panel-mode no less \u2013 as Mugi lays with her get the point across easy enough.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai\u2019s medium-sized cast each have their own take on and approach to love that ultimately defines their characters while simultaneously supporting the anime\u2019s goals.\\n\\n\r\nAs the main protagonist, Hanabi receives the most room in which to provide insight for the audience. Her friends-with-benefits-without-intercourse pact allows her (and Mugi) to relish in her fantasies and fuel her thoughts. Specifically speaking, she contemplates the love she holds and its importance to her through different ideas like unrequited feelings and pureness of heart.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, Hanabi is influenced greatly by many of the people around her. She spends a lot of time with Mugi, learning more about what she desires from this sincere love of hers. She doesn\u2019t deny Ecchan\u2019s advances out of a hypocritical sense of duty. She lets Akane\u2019s words and actions get to her, pushing her to try and use love as a weapon rather than as an emotion, only for her to succumb to the same attack. She even has the occasional out-of-body experiences where her consciousness berates her for her sometimes scummy behavior.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, she remains \u201cfamily\u201d with Narumi despite her feelings failing to connect and parts ways with Mugi per their original agreement. Most importantly, she comes to respect and appreciate love. She has seen how it hurts and seen how it helps, so she now views it as something worthwhile \u2013 no matter the outcome.\\n\\n\r\nMugi is different. As Kuzu no Honkai shows, he has conflicting thoughts due to a sense of adolescence and base instincts. As he describes it, \u201cEven I have things I want to keep closed off from the world.\u201d His childhood friend Noriko and his previous sexual relationship with an older classmate named Mei pull him in different directions. So, in contrast to Hanabi, he doesn\u2019t really know what he wants. He obviously loves Akane, but, as for what this love itself entails, he hasn\u2019t the faintest idea.\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of the season, though, he as well comes to realize what love means to him. He cares about Hanabi because she remains the same passionate person despite the similar situation she faces. He does not move forward with Noriko because he refuses to tarnish their relationship. He falls for Akane because he thought he could alter her into someone better.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, for Mugi, love is something that doesn\u2019t change. An emotion that persists through tears and time and toying. That\u2019s what makes it one of the most everlasting, most impactful feelings out there. And he witnesses this firsthand all over.\\n\\n\r\nNarumi is the only other (important) male character in Kuzu no Honkai, and, while he isn\u2019t involved or around to the same extent as the others, he serves his role well. He calls himself a boring guy, and he\u2019s quite right. For, unlike everyone else, he is meant to be the \u201cregular\u201d one of the whole bunch. Someone who is like any normal person out there in the audience looking for love.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, Akane sort of reminded him of his mother, and he chose to believe \u201cit was fate\u201d that brought a boring guy like him and a \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d girl like her near each other. Indeed, fate does follow through when his feelings reach the woman of his dreams. Granted, him not minding if Akane cheats while they are married and together is far from normal, but he does not want her to lose herself because of love. If nothing else, his heartfelt understanding makes him into an admirable man.\\n\\n\r\nAkane herself is arguably the most interesting character in the anime. Despite her beautiful and kind outward appearance, her heart harbors much darker feelings. She uses love to manipulate men and hurt women to the point that she practically gets off on her tactics. And, if she isn\u2019t having any fun fooling around, then she quickly loses interest and moves onto the next hapless set of people.\\n\\n\r\nComparing her to the rest of the cast, Akane is the odd one out because she isn\u2019t looking for love. She\u2019s never had those feelings before since her behavior prevents her from truly loving someone else. So, naturally, this issue becomes the central conflict for her character later in the season. And, once she and Narumi share a special connection, Akane demonstrates that love is something possible and available for anyone. That it can save someone from even the darkest of places.\\n\\n\r\nThat leaves Ecchan and Noriko. Ecchan loves Hanabi, and she knows that Hanabi does not reciprocate her feelings. Yet she does not care. So long as Ecchan can share herself with Hanabi, be there with her, then she ignores what goes on between them and around them.\\n\\n\r\nThus, Ecchan acts on her urges in a way that\u2019s uncomfortable to watch. She forces herself on Hanabi and pursues after her despite what Hanabi says. Yes, Hanabi is also in the wrong for at times accepting Ecchan\u2019s advances, but it\u2019s Ecchan\u2019s unhealthy mindset that causes their awkward situation to begin with. In fact, the anime introduces Atsuya, Ecchan\u2019s cousin, into the mix all the way in episode eight not only to include yet another off-kilter romantic relationship but also to get reality back into her brain.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Noriko, she literally gets screwed the least and figuratively gets screwed the most. Near the start of the season, she receives about as much attention as one would describe her stature. Then, she disappears for a large chunk in the middle of the season, making hardly any appearances whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime, realizing its mistake, has all of episode seven focusing on her character. Therein, it forms and completes her entire arc in a slipshod manner. Afterwards, she goes back to being nonexistent with only a scene or two in the final few episodes of the season featuring her newfound drive. Altogether, Noriko is the worst-handled cast member in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBoth Ecchan and Noriko argue for the same stance on love: It isn\u2019t a be-all, end-all part of life. Ecchan cuts her hair for that classic \u201cturning a new leaf\u201d look and rekindles her friendship with Hanabi. Similarly, Noriko has started to mature now that she\u2019s no longer constrained by a sense of romantic duty. The two lose big time in the game of love, but they have come out the better for it.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the main characters in Kuzu no Honkai clearly have a thematic connection to love. And, while their development as characters in this drama isn\u2019t anything remarkable, they each go through their own change and experiences over the course of the season. Considering the size of the cast, the anime does pretty well for a twelve-episode series.\\n\\n\r\nAny small nitpicks aside, the biggest writing problem here is one that some anime unfortunately encounter: very little interaction exists among the entire cast. Within this big romantic conglomerate, Ecchan interacts almost exclusively with Hanabi. Mugi never speaks with Narumi. Noriko doesn\u2019t confide in Akane ever. Even important connections like Hanabi and Narumi\u2019s don\u2019t really have that much going on. Theirs is mostly built through flashback rather than present-day events between the two. Indeed, the anime almost never has three of these characters simultaneously conversing let alone in the same area.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s strange to see them exist in their small number of duo bubbles because their relationships are intermingled, yet the full dynamic doesn\u2019t come to fruition. They also each have their own stances and thoughts on love, but, due to the lack of crossover, these differences rarely clash. Overall, it weakens the dimensionality of the characters, and it weakens the show\u2019s thematic exploration.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nWhile the anime\u2019s drama, romance, and visual techniques tend to take center stage, Kuzu no Honkai is not without notable musical choices throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nSpecifically, the opening track and the ending track are an interesting set of sounds that coincide well with the show\u2019s main ideas. The OP channels a catchy guitar riff, piano keys, and drum fills. They coalesce into a fast-paced, tone-changing piece whose flow reflects the characters own passionate emotions. The ED begins with melancholy in mind and, shortly thereafter, gives way to a charged section. The first part represents the sadness that sometimes follows love, and the second part represents the frustration. All as the vocalist sings her heart out.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack also deserves praise. It fills the air with weighty piano arrangements, acoustic guitar strings, and poignant crescendos that mold the mood into love and loss and languish. Arguably, the OST is the main contributor behind the anime\u2019s overly dramatic presentation since these orchestral compositions don\u2019t fit a scene like Hanabi and Mugi locking pinkies as they form their relationship pact. Even so, their ability to achieve such dramatization cannot be ignored.\\n\\n\r\nChika Anzai as Hanabi is the only strong voice acting performance thanks to her range of emotions (embarrassed, morose, happy, angry) and her cute inflection. However, the anime provides just enough lascivious sounds from the whole cast (and their actions) to redden the audience\u2019s ears (and make them wonder how awkward the recording booth sessions were) yet refrain from becoming a full-blown porno.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nAs many of my readers may know, I love romance. It\u2019s my favorite genre out there. The confessions, the blushing, the words, the happiness, the connection. Romance is sweet, plain and simple.\\n\\n\r\nBut I also like it when it gets messy.\\n\\n\r\nIn this anime, the juicy, yucky romance all over the place made for an entertaining time. They cheated. They pined. They forced. Dirty and rough, it\u2019s something that I don\u2019t normally get to see here in the medium. I constantly exclaimed \u201choly moly\u201d and \u201cwhoa\u201d as the characters made their moves and the story rarely let up on the sexual advances.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I am not too invested in most of the characters. Mugi is a pretty all right dude, but he\u2019s very uninteresting. Narumi and Noriko barely have any time on screen to make me care about them. Ecchan not minding her mistress role and her lesbian characterization in general puts her above those previously listed, but the show does not explore her angle enough.\\n\\n\r\nEven Hanabi isn\u2019t the most appealing. She is fun and cute at times, but I still didn\u2019t much care about her character\u2019s arc throughout the season. She is more a victim of circumstance than an active player, so her actions were not the most riveting.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character I liked (who, after process of elimination, can be easily guessed) is Akane. Yes, I find her physically attractive, but, more so than anyone else, she had an edge to her setup. She is selfish in her ways. She coerces men left and right. She keeps up a dual personality. Akane goes from a horrible person to a tolerable woman, and her course made her the most fun to watch out of the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nI do have to touch on the ending as well, for it made me slightly melancholic. The only people who win in the end are Akane the antagonist (who arguably didn\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d it) and Narumi the only regular character in the show (who arguably did \u201cdeserve\u201d it).\\n\\n\r\nThe other four lose hard. Noriko is denied, Ecchan moves on, and both Hanabi and Mugi part ways seemingly forever. I actually thought Hanabi and Mugi would have ended up together, but such fate did not occur. Combined with knowing that this adaptation is complete \u2013 meaning the story is done and told in its entirety \u2013 I could not help but frown (in a positive sense) at the fact that an all-around happy ending was just not meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai may feature scummy people but it is far from scum itself. The characters involved explore many sides to love, the art remains pretty throughout the season, and the majority of its musical choices fit quite well. Its story embraces a few questionable decisions, but, as a whole, it all still worked out when all is said and done.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, a promiscuous take on the proverb \u201cIt\u2019s better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all\u201d which explores love\u2019s multifaceted strengths and weaknesses while also succumbing to a rigid format and noticeable tonal issues\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Good, while very little movement actually occurs, the paneling techniques, the boosted artistry, and the different creative scenes clearly demonstrate that the visuals were not left forgotten\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Hanabi, Mugi, and the other important characters represent different forms and ideas about love, but the lack of intermingling among the whole cast weakens their overall impact\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Good, a passionate OP-and-ED combo back a poignant, crescendo-filled OST, and the VA performances, while nothing special, redden one\u2019s ears\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, juicy romance, Akane was the only interesting character overall, and the bittersweet ending got to me slightly\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "Kuzu no honkai is one of the few romance anime who mange to capture the full reality of love in real life. In most anime, they fall in love and all is well and everything is great. Not in kuzu no honkai.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nThis tale is so much more than two horny teenagers. They're heart broken at the hopelessness of them managing to make their dreams reality, and therefore use each other as replacements. They give each other everything, except for their feelings. But that's not it. More characters who genuinely love them come into play, making it all so much more exciting to watch. It'svery real and cruel, it perfectly illustrates the negative side of love, the fact you can't control your feelings and other people's feelings. So much I even cried at the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThe art isn't particularly AMAZING but it is rather nice to look at. The colors used are soft, not bright and brilliant, which suits the nature of the anime. The line art is a little rugged, which gives literal sense to the saying \" rough around the edges \". The animation is pretty smooth, nothing to say about that.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is absolutely beautiful. When I first heard the anime opening, I was captivated by the beautiful vocals. What I didn't know was that at the end, there was a even better ending. The singer's voice was amazing throughout the piece. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters in Kuzu no Honkai are complex and unpredictable, despite the fact it was only a 12 episode long anime. You couldn't sort them in categories or dere types, they acted with personalities that only suited them which is part of why this anime is so dear to me. They act out according to whatever they think they should do, not to whatever rules their certain type needs to abide by.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed Kuzu no Honkai thoroughly. Never was I bored, not for a second. It kept my attention all the way to the end, without fail, as most anime should strive to achieve.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai was for me a breeze of fresh air in the winter 2017 anime season. I tolerate the fact it's more of a hit-or-miss kind of anime; for most either you love it or you hate it. On my part, it was a great decision i took when I decided to watch, since it is now one of my favorites.",

Shame on you author!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 2/10\\n\r\nI never saw a show about romance with this kind of bland characters that have no connection to the story or plot in this anime.The way they work with each other it\u2019s a mess and they ruin the anime .\\n\\n\r\nHanabi is the heroine of this show , her character is the silent type and the one who watches from the side lines like a fool, she is egoist has a cold heart and the way she acts and interacts with others around her it\u2019s annoying.\\n\\n\r\nMugi this is the most useless character he is just a plot device and his only purpose is to have sex in all the anime.Sometimes he tries to act as a smartass but fails . \\n\\n\r\nAkane is the best girl and the only character who has development in the whole anime.Her character development is amazing and it\u2019s a fact from a person who is lonely and looks for affection and attention in the bed of different men to a lovely person who has found the warmth in her heart called \u201cfamily\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nMoka this character was presented in one episode and then tossed away from the rest of the series and why she was even present in this anime to begin with?\\n\\n\r\nEcchan was added as a spice character for those who love yuri stories and cringe festivals about how two girls who love each other and have sex and then  break up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 0/10\\n\r\nOnly masochists would enjoy this kind of show or fangirls who believe in stories about a prince on a white horse. It\u2019s annoying and forced drama all over the place plus the characters make the enjoyment worse. It\u2019s a waste of time watch better anime like Shouwa Rakugo.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8/10\\n\r\nThe use of panel manga and roses all over the show in a repetitive way makes it unique but brings no sense to the story tbh.\\n\\n\r\nSound 2/10\\n\r\nIts awful the soundtrack I don\u2019t know how the opening is good when it\u2019s the same as the anime filled with autistic characters and roses.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10\\n\r\nThe last episode did not resolve anything or have a conclusion like a ending is supposed to do for a series it was the same as first episode the only character development for the characters was the hair some of them cut their hair short.

How about, have you ever been at a low point of your life when you feel that nothing fits together anymore and you're isolated from the the world? This anime manages to make you feel dreadful while watching it just to bring you an unexpected twist which makes you feel worse. If you're expecting an anime that would make you feel elated and euphoric, this is the complete opposite of what you should watch.  \r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story takes place in a typical high school settingwhile is usually the case for anime with romance and drama. Throughout the anime, you are captivated into wanting to know what is next even though you know that someone's heart will be shattered and their feelings will be unrequited and trampled on for the selfishness. Kuzu no Honkai presents this interesting romance anime with a good story until the end where I believe it was quite rushed. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nAlthough the story was quite saddening, the art was absolutely beautiful. Every character had unique characteristics.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe opening \"Uso no Hibana\" was only decent in my opinion, but, the ending \"Heikousen\" was superb. Comparing the soundtracks and OSTs in this anime with other animes this season, Kuzu no Honkai was the best.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nEvery character had unique personalities however twisted. Most of them had a selfish trait that overshadowed all their good traits and many characters in the anime used others for the sake of themselves. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis anime made me hate all the characters, but no matter how much I wanted to stop, I just kept watching the next episode. I wouldn't call this feeling enjoyment, but rather curiosity. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nKuzu No Honkai was eye-opening in the fact that you realize that most people have an ulterior motive, all for the sake of love. Remember the feeling at the end of Re-Zero when you wanted to punch the screen because Subaru chose the wrong girl? That is my personal opinion, but it applies to this anime based off the fact that I believe Mugi liked the wrong person in the end and did not give me the ending I wanted.\\n\\n",

            "content": "If someone makes you a beautiful cake and you want to have it to keep looking at the decoration then you\u2019ll have to wait to eat it. If you want to eat your cake then you can\u2019t enjoy the appearance of having your cake to look at. This is Kuzu no Honkai (Scum\u2019s Wish) in a nutshell, its blatantly trying to have its cake and eat it too. You see too often where sex can be treated as mature, artful and important as long as it\u2019s terrible in being both physically and emotionally unsatisfying, or just having negative effects in the story. The characters andsexual content are presented as \u201csexy\u201d while reassuring the viewers at every turn that it\u2019s only doing so because it\u2019s important to the emotional arc of the narrative. The sex scenes are very detailed and titillating from they way they are drawn and animated along with the various camera angles used, but, none of them is straightforwardly gratifying for the characters. This is why it\u2019s hard to take Scum\u2019s Wish seriously.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of this, the show is constantly pounding away at your head to the point of swelling with excessive melodrama and shallow characters with endless internal monologuing that becomes quickly insufferable where they literally explain their emotions every time over displaying them. Do you like a messed-up love polygon? Scum's Wish follows Hanabi Yasuraoka, a high schooler who is in love with her teacher and childhood friend, Narumi Kanai. However, when the object of her affection begins to show interest in another woman, Akane Minagawa, Hanabi makes a deal with her classmate, Mugi Awaya (who is in love with Akane), that they dull each other's loneliness and pain. By platonically sating each other's desires and substituting those who they wish to be with using the other, Mugi and Hanabi hope to stave off their sadness and one day be with the ones they love. This is their \"scum's wish.\" Both Hanabi and Mugi have girls that have unrequited love for them in Sanae Ebato and Noriko Komomebata. They come across as characters meant to distract you from the shallowness of the main threads. It turns into this twisted eye-rolling orgy fest where each one\u2019s love isn\u2019t reciprocated and they all use each other, most times in the most nonsensical of ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is just messy. On its own, the various arcs could make for good stories, but because each arc is meant to fit into the grander story that the show is telling, the majority of it feels forced. Scum\u2019s Wish has this melodramatic and hyper-serious tone for the most part that makes the experience exhausting and hard to sit through an episode, and then, it randomly throws out these small segments of comedic relief, sometimes after a \"serious\" moment. It\u2019s very bizarre and confusing, not because they clash with the oppressively melodramatic tone, but because the transitions in between are so quick that they amount to nothing meaningful\u2014something similar to how Akame ga Kill would go from a brutal, dark scene and quickly cut in and out with these clich\u00e9 comedic scenes, which comes back to what I stated earlier, \u201ctrying to have its cake and eat it too.\u201d It\u2019s hard to care about any of the characters when there\u2019s just nothing going on with them whatsoever outside of their sexual desires. They have the personalities and charisma to that of a brick wall. When they\u2019re not moping around over relationship drama, they\u2019re literally just sitting around, bored, and this is where the endless internal monologuing becomes unbearably painful.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters bore you to death with their dialogue that everything else about the show becomes so nauseating and obnoxious. They all exist in a metaphorical box where they're forced to play the role the plot has laid out for them, they\u2019re given little room to grow and can only hope to break out of their small, melodramatic shackles. This series lacks emotional depth but it\u2019s presented in a pretentious way like its intentions are smutty, but it wants you to see them as fearless and important. Cheating, illicit relationships with teachers and students, a lesbian who has a cousin that is in love with her\u2014these taboos are crossed not because the show has something interesting to say about these kinds of relationships, but because taboos are considered hot, and this is smut. The kicker was when the veil was lifted off Akane\u2019s character. I could totally get that she gets satisfaction of being a calculating, manipulative and a bona fide bitch to those she sleeps with, but the fact that she goes out of her way to rub salt into her teenaged student\u2019s emotional wounds that she\u2019s sleeping with the man she loves, while also sleeping with another teenaged student on the side, just reaches a new high of absurdity. How much more cartoonish of a villain can you get? She has no care in the world that she\u2019s giving a Hanabi, who deeply resents her, a lot of ammo to get her into legal trouble\u2013a total lack of morality. Akane basically takes a dump on your suspension of disbelief, what reason would make sense for her to be like this? It\u2019s smutty melodrama for smutty melodrama\u2019s sake.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, studio Lechre did a great number adapting Mengo Yokoyari\u2019s manga, opting for a softer look to its characters, using very thin outlines, tonal shading, and a limited sombre colour palette. Combined with this, the show features quality detailed backgrounds and great use of panelling, shot composition and special effects\u2014like the splashes of ink and watercolour paint on certain scenes to portray the multiple facets of emotion from its characters. The animation is fine, as, for the most part, the show prefers shots that linger on still images over moving animation. The way that the sex scenes are presented just makes the phrase \u201csex sells\u201d more prominent here, and that just destroys any message the show tries to convey through it. While its mostly used to simply accent the more comedic and emotional moments, the soundtrack is forgettable. Both Opening and Ending is trying really hard with the symbolic imagery and song choices, especially the Ending, it becomes cringeworthy\u2014refer to the flowers as an example. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone\u2019s arcs resolve with the tension of that of a wet paper towel. Scum\u2019s Wish simultaneously puts its characters in cruel situations while treating them like fragile objects that can\u2019t suffer the slightest nudge, lest they break which weakens any emotional impact. The story has nothing to offer beyond the relationship drama, no one feels like a real person with a life, even if a miserable one. It\u2019s a story-driven show under the guise of being a character-driven one. As a result, when the group of one-dimensional characters that are defined by their issues are lumped in with an over-the-top character like Akane, the contrast is blindingly apparent that she seems almost alien for how much she stands out among them. A point to bring up again, and it\u2019s a jarring problem is there\u2019s not a single time throughout this entire series that a character will legitimately enjoy a sexual encounter. In the odd cases where they do, they feel some resentment, usually towards themselves. To be blunt, if you are looking for a show that looks at sex in a way that is mature or realistic, this is not the show for you because every time it wants to be mature about sex it devolves into immature melodrama that stretches reason beyond intrigue.\\n\\n\r\nWhat has become clear after re-watching this series while writing the review, is that the characters are far from the scum that they want to believe themselves to be. Majority of their problems are the result of having too pure of innocent true love. They all have sexual encounters, but it\u2019s always to heal their emotional wounds. The only character who actually acts kind of scummy is Sanae, who takes advantage of her friendship with Hanabi to knowingly overreach in her sexual advances. Instead of hating these characters, you just get bored, their journey doesn\u2019t really amount to anything when everything is solved by the natural force of time passing, and the characters are simply moving along whichever course is clear in front of them\u2014and you\u2019re just waiting and waiting for them to get to that point. You\u2019re not going to perfectly predict who was going to end up with whom in the or exactly how they\u2019d get there, but the journey doesn\u2019t take the viewer anywhere which isn\u2019t obvious. All in all, a Scum\u2019s Wish isn\u2019t scummier enough, and that\u2019s a big objective the show failed at, which in turn, transforms this tale of a darker side of adolescent romance and well-being into a disdainful sexual melodrama of terminally boring kids, waiting to be noticed.",

            "content": "I've seen people get holy-handed angry about this series, claiming it's nothing more than dialled-back netorare (i.e. a subgenre of hentai revolving around a female lead cuckolding the male lead) or that it's comparable to School Days, of all things. The lack of imagination and empathy towards these characters when it comes to understanding that this is not simply \"School Days 2017\" but actually much more mature, intelligent, and hard-hitting than School Days could ever hope to be. Other people say that it's an uncomfortable anime to watch, and there again I don't get why they seem to think so. If this had been rooteddeeply in the Seinen genre with despicable, lousy characters who possessed extremely cynical and cruel personalities and set against a painfully realistic storyline, I would understand. But no, this story doesn't. It's more interested in presenting the world through the eyes of Hanabi and Mugi, two teenagers who, despite their aching hearts, are still pretty well-adjusted teenagers that haven't completely and totally given themselves up to angst like Catcher in the Rye or the insanely annoying \"moral nihilism\" that pop up in series featuring Light Yagami expys.\\n\\n\r\n  Some people also claim this is basically soft-core porn, also like School Days. I for one do not feel like a voyeur when the implied sex scenes occur. Rather, I feel like they are handled elegantly and tastefully while still being realistic in the context that they're placed. Closeness and intimacy are what these characters desire, and sex is a vehicle for those desires to be found. Characters react realistically to each other, libidos are naturally strong in teenagers like Mugi and Hana and they've found reciprocating outlets to express those sexual desires of theirs.\\n\\n\r\nA compelling theme that also underlies the story is the question as to whether unrequited love can be compartmentalized in order to make room for other relationships, or if it truly \"doesn't matter\" if the love isn't reciprocated as long as the two are still in close proximity and on good terms. Is being in their presence \"enough\" for a person, or does it only serve as a constant reminder of what they don't, or can't, have? And at what point does unrequited love step graduate from private suffering to underhanded imposition on the uninterested object of affection? Are people obligated to recognize and return the feelings of those who feel so strongly for them, even if it's acknowledgement? More than that, does love breed love -- that is, can a person be swayed to develop similar feelings in turn after bearing witness to another's devotion to them?  \\n\\n\r\nThe balking at a story such as this is simply proof that people believe love to be a static and definable thing when in fact it is as ebbing and amorphous as water. It manifests itself in different shapes and types, filling and emptying, freezing and thawing endlessly in reaction to, in synergy with, and in anticipation of the actions of others. If exploring the entirely gray world of love is something that makes you feel uneasy, then watch something else  that saves you the pain of prompting you to re-evaluate your own personal relationships and what those relationships mean to you by just telling you \"These relationships = Good; Everything else = Bad\".",

Lots of people say that that character a bitch. She's a bitch\uff0cof course\uff0cbut not because she has sex with men\uff0cis because she built her happiness on other female characters' pain. That is shameless and WROSE than a bitch. I believe she is a typical bitch and does not need any excuses to defend herself\uff0cand she knows about that. The original creator of the manga series of this anime\uff0cMengo Yokoyari\uff0cher purpose is to let people know the thoughts of the scums\uff0cinstead of finding excuses for those scums.\\n\r\nBasically\uff0cthe anime is telling us\uff1aSuperiority and vanity appear through comparison between people\uff0conce a person's vanity is satisfied\uff0canother person would full of inferiority.\\n\r\nThat's why this tragedy would happen.",

You would be surprise how far Kuzu no Honkai went as a romance, drama anime as it does have some sexual content in it.\r\nThe greatness to the story is that it has great connections to each character and reflects on how they got in there position they are in now. The story keeps you wanting to know more about each character and drives you to continue to watch and learn more on the developingof each character.\\n\\n\r\nIt has its very dull moments where it does prevent you to continue it sometimes, in a situation where you don't mind missing the part your watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing no questions about it, the expressions on the characters to the scenery is breath taking.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is really outstanding from the op/ed to the ost that plays a part on emotional scenes. The downfall is that there was a lot of quietness in the anime like dull moments that should have a better sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The characters are outstanding how they each connect to each other and how they reflect on other characters behaviors. The expressions of the characters are my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Kuzu no Honkai it had made me cried and feel sad in a lot of situations. Its very emotional and wants you to connect to each character and build a greater connection. I really enjoyed this anime and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys romance and drama.

Let me start by attacking the criticism i've read upon. For one people are criticizing the story for the ecchi scenes that are in it, which I have to admit,are a bit over the top. I didn't find harm in these sex scenes because if you actually freaking watch and understand the STORY of the anime (aka plot) you would know that the sex scenesshould not be hot to you, it has deep meanings tied in with the plot which talks about a lot of the issues of some relationships and unrequited love.As you should know when they have sex or something they talk about a lot of stuff and at the end they never do it.In that time they advance the plot and makes you think more seariously about this anime.\\n\\n\r\n7 for Art. I have no idea why people liked the art of this anime.There's so many anime out there that has better art than this and it was in 720p all along. Like no even kidding this is the most clich\u00e9d art and really basic but it doesnt mean it's bad like hentai art with some colorful scenes.\\n\\n\r\n9 for sound cuz it sets up the mood pretty well but lacking sometimes.I really loved the opening and ending and as the weeb I am I played the opening and ending the whole way through the anime ;)\\n\\n\r\n10 character because of the constant character devellopement which is really well spread out.Some people criticize the character devellopement because there's way too many characters to worry about, but my opinion is that every single side character devellops the main characters background I mean that's what they're supposed to do as supporting characters...It is also very constant how they move back to the main characters instead of distancing from them like in to love ru.\\n\\n\r\n10 for enjoyement cuz I freaking loved the anime I mean the fact that I made it my first review because of the critisism people gave it should mean something...Also it made me look foward to every friday afternoon waiting for a kuzu no honkai episode which made my march go really fast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10, you might be here like \"Oh yea Jesse just wrote like a whole entire essay and he gives if a clich\u00e9d 10/10? Wow I just spent my time for nothing\" first off fuck you and secondly I told you I was just attacking the criticism and I dont think it's bad to give an anime that I was looking foward to every week a perfect score because I really think it was a masterpiece that deserves more love. Anyways like I said my name is Jesse if you're reading this well it's my first review and my true uncorrupted opinion of the show if ya liked my review I could make more in futur but for now thanks! Also I just discovered I can't attack other reviewers... whatever fuck them.",

Seeing someone you love loves the other person, and listening to their confessions to their loved ones are the one of the most painful things to experience.

            "content": "Note: This review was written a while ago when the show was over. Thus, it does not necessarily represent my current opinions, writing, scores or anything really. Still, I somewhat stand with the core ideas of the review.\r\nUnlike other anime that have aired during these past seasons, Kuzu no Honkai is a special one. Not because it has a high number of great qualities, but because it will survive the test of time. The test forgotten anime fail to pass. The test which determines whether people will still talk about you years after you have made your debut. It is a special feeling when yousee these series' as they grow to become popular. It's like seeing an immature child grow in front of your eyes, waiting for their inevitable breakthrough. This, is exactly the tale Kuzu no Honkai tells. The story of an immature child growing up. A child that has no idea what she's doing with her life. The child that falls so deeply in love for the person that sees her grow that it becomes toxic. A love that inspires the birth of an impure relationship. A mutual agreement between two people that do not love each other, just a replacement for the other person they cannot have. Sounds poetic doesn't it? Well, at least on paper. Kuzu no Honka is another example of how great premises do not equal a great product. Lets talk about Scum's Wish.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to know the reason Scum's Wish will stand the test of time, look no further than what it's trying to be. The themes of this series have been left rather unexplored in the anime medium. Calling Scum's Wish a romance is rather vague and misleading. This isn't your typical romance anime. I'm going to be honest here, this sh*t gets f*cked up (excuse my language, but profanity is the best way to communicate ideas). The first minutes seem rather normal for a highschool romance story. \"We get shots of the school campus, a girl having some fantasies about her crush which she calls \"Brother\" (it's anime, nothing new), then the main girl starts having an internal monolog about unrequited love. A random guy shows up, takes her to the back of the school and they start kissing. Nothing n--, wait, what? Kissing? On the first episode of a Shoujo-looking anime Drama? Something's not right here. These usually take an eternity to get something remotely close to confessing, don't even get me started on kissing. Some series never even reach this point\". It is at this moment (and the Opening which is somewhat \"dark\", graphic and has some nice symbolisms) the viewer is let to know this is not a typical anime Drama. First episode ends, you just witnessed a sex scene. The episode ends, the story of scum begins.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is a girl named Hanabi. As I said earlier, she is in love with a person much older than her (her teacher to be exact) named Narumi Kanai. Due to Hanabi's lack of a parental figure (I can already relate to this), she basically gets raised by Kanai. Told to the viewer by a series of ocasional flashbacks, she starts developing feelings for Kanai since she was a child because of his unconditional support and the love he demonstrates to her. Unfortunately for her, her \"Brother\" has no romantic interest in her because he sees Hanabi as a little sister that he raised himself. One day she meets Mugi, a popular guy in school that has the same dilemma as Hana. He likes a much older woman named Akane Minagawa which was his former tutor and is now working as a teacher in their school. When they find out both their crushes are growing interest towards each other, Mugi and Hana decide to fill their voids by dating one another. More importantly is their promise: \"You can have anything but my feelings\". They start sharing physical intimacy and gets really graphic for an anime aired on Japanese television.\\n\\n\r\nI am going to start by saying that the first episode is a beauty. Very slick and simplistic animation, beautiful OST, nice transitions, appealing voice acting, a great introduction of its themes and a very intimate, steamy sex scene. The following episodes follow the same lines exploring impurity and the main character's slow discovery to a world of lust, at some points with different characters to mix things up. It was all good and dandy the first couple of episodes. Being a frequent observer of online anime communities and seasonal conversations, most of the people who picked this up were very impressed with the show's start. Unfortunately (and I'm sad to say this), Kuzu no Honkai slowly starts going downhill pretty fast. It is around half of its run time (maybe earlier to some) when the viewer starts realizing the monotony and lack of substance this series has suffers.\\n\\n\r\nI think everyone can agree that the show's main appeal was the use of sex and teenage lust to tell a romance story. In a world of thousands series of boring and unimaginative romances (I'm looking at you Masamune-kun), it was really refreshing experiencing an anime that was clearly made with a mature audience in mind. EXCEPT, it really doesn't feel like it after a while.\\n\\n\r\nTo talk about the use of sex to convey emotions, I would like to give credit where credit is due. Even though there are sex scenes in every episode, not one felt the same. I'm not referring to how they bang, but the feeling each intimate moment conveys. The famous scene in episode one is by far the most erotic. If you feel like a pervert for feeling excited during the first sex scene, then don't because everyone felt the same. There are two reasons why this scene feels like the most erotic one: because it's new to the viewer, and because it is intentionally portrayed as such. This is as new to us as it is to the protagonist Hanabi. The scene were she is the most turned on is the one you should also be turned on. After episode one, the sex scenes get less and less exciting. The show goes from showing us almost everything to almost nothing at all. The scenes are reduced to a couple of seconds or even still images of the characters having sex or sleeping together, while the first was almost half of the episode. The later scenes can be exciting to some, but for me personally I just felt bad for everyone involved. The farther they go, the worst I felt because even though without context it looks like hot sex with characters that are having the time of their lives, these people are not happy at all. I am very disappointed that Scum's wish fell of track and lost some of its potential.\\n\\n\r\nThe main factors that contributed to the decline of Scum's Wish are two things: the overuse of sex and the melodrama. What first felt like it was meaningful and unique shifted to being monotonous, unnecessary and excessive. There's a point where the main characters start having sex with literally anyone and everyone. The creator(s) prioritized sex over story and while the story is told through these moments of intimacy (or lack there of), the excessive amount of f*cking starts feeling like fanservice. You know the sex and teen melodrama starts becoming a problem when extremely one dimensional characters are introduced just for the sake of having someone new to have foreplay and to further complicate the already hard to follow love polygon. When their arc is finished and their roles have been fulfilled, they disappear in thin air, never heard of again.\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated earlier, the awaiting success and popularity of Scum's Wish is because of what it's trying to be: A story about the endless battle between love and lust, the pure and the impure. There is no denying the appeal of Scum's Wish is its graphic nature. This anime obviously tries to appeal to a mature audience and its graphic intimate scenes are what ultimately will make this series a more discussed one and it will inevitably attract a growing, teenage audience full of hormones. It is one of those series that teenagers will see a clip of and they ask the name of it just to see some animated softcore porn. I'm not saying this is bad, but for that reason this anime will probably never be forgotten. The world is always pumping out new teens into the world and they will discover this anime one way or another. If not teenagers seeking for those scenes, it will be anime fans interested on the different take on the Romance genre. Either way, Scum's Wish will gain more popularity as timepasses and I would be shocked if it did not.\\n\\n\r\nWith a series that contains at least one sex scene in every episode, it is impossible to not raise some questions about the plot's morals. Is sex being used in the correct way? Is it really necessary to have a sex scene in every single episode? Does the use of sex really contribute anything to the plot, or is it simply used for the sake of attracting the viewer with fanservice? I'm by far the right guy to answer any of those questions in a credible way, but in my opinion the use of sex in this series is what makes this series unique from the rest. Everyone can agree that this show without the sex would just be a cheesy, boring anime and would be immediately forgotten when the season ends like the anime Orange a couple of months ago. Sure the concept of unrequited love and being with a person you don't love for the sake of not feeling lonely sounds great on paper, but I cannot see a way to make it interesting for a whole 12 episodes. There has to be something the other anime don't have, some sort of \"gimmick\" that attracts the viewer. The gimmick in this show is, well sex. In most of Kuzu no Honkai's case, it just feels like a gimmick and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I said this show would be like if it didn't have sex still sort of applies to what Kuzu no Honkai is. Something also bothered me is that the show tries to be too... what's the word? Poetic, I should say. Every single character gets at least one extensive monolog about how they feel or how scum they are. There are some scenes that are fantastically edited and have interesting symbolisms, but I could not shake the feeling that sometimes the story was trying to be too \"poetic\" for its own sake. I am a firm believer that there is nothing more poetic than human emotions, but the show sometimes tries to be too dramatic with its dialog and soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nThe last major criticism I have for Scum's Wish is regarding one specific character, Mugi's crush Akane. This woman is the only individual I could not stand and evoked hatred and displeasure on me every time she was on screen. Not even Noriko's extremely annoying voice was as annoying as Akane. This character was uninteresting, her personality sucked, her decisions sucked and her motivations to play with the emotions of everyone around her are nonsensical, foolish and clich\u00e9. She has the typical \"bad anime person\" personality and the fact that the shows gives her the spotlight for a good number of the already limited episodes is just a slap in the face. You don't shift the focus from the best and most interesting character in Hana to literally the worst character on the f*cking show. The development for Akane was needed for the route Scum's Wish decided to take, but when the payoff is as unsatisfactory and uninteresting as it was, you can say it was all for nothing.\\n\\n\r\nEven though it seems like I hate Scum's Wish with the way I talk about it and the problems I have with it, I did enjoy this series. This may sound sick, but to me it was very satisfying seeing these people's lives go downhill. As the title implies, they are all scum and the show's greatest quality is showing how much of a bad people they are. This was not the best anime of the season, but I can say it was the most entertaining to watch. I appreciate the approach it tries to take and even though it doesn't do anything exceptional with its ideas, they are there. Sure the last episodes lost my attention because of the lack of Hanabi and the monotonous events, but overall I do recommend this series for those who look for something new. Kuzu no Honkai is nothing special, but definitely worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nRating MAL's Attributes for Reviews:\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacters:6\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\nOverall: Do the math",

            "content": "Why is Scum's Wish such a terrifyingly good anime? \r\nA. It's better than the manga. I do not deny the mangaka's merit in creating the story, and the characters and the general flow of things. But the creators of the anime took that and gave it added value. The anime tells the same story, but with a huge attention to details, trying to always convey the characters' actual mood and emotions, removing some of the ambiguities inherent to the printed material and giving everything more depth and clarity.\r\nB. The story feels real. Not in the sense that this would happen to you, of course not,it is fiction and far-fetched at best. But the feelings and thoughts of the main characters feel real, they feel like what you would actually expect from 16-year olds, maybe what you feel or felt at that age. They are deeply involved in their passions, as youth would naturally dictate, but they are also imperfect, they make dubious decisions, they question themselves, then go back and forth between what is good or what is good for them a that moment. That's what adolescence is all about, knowing and defining one's imperfect self.\\n\\n\r\nC. It's different. The main reason why some would think that it's different is the more mature content, which I still think shocks some people, although we are all just being hypocritical about it. I don't know if any of the content could apply specifically to Japanese high-schoolers, but I do think it can apply to high-schoolers in general. It does not sell you an easy, sugary story that you want to see but will never actually live through. Up to know it also does not sell you an overblown drama. It just shows life, in its pure and inconvenient form, with people being people, and lets you play judge and jury if that's what you fancy. \\n\\n\r\nD. The art. In general. Not only how the characters are drawn or animated, which is good, but nothing unheard of. But the use of symbols, still-frames, music and other such props. It's beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not that I wanted to enjoy Scum's Wish, but I feel my self liking it more with every episode. I am not even crazy about the manga, when I read it, it felt like it had some poisonously addictive quality about it. But I do like the anime. I relate more to the characters, I like how it's made, I find it interesting. We'll see how it goes from here.",

Futhermore, my thoughts on this anime and specific scenes will not be shared as there are no spoilers.\r\n\"Love will make you blind.\" -Yasuraoka, Hanabi\r\nKuzu no Honkai adapted from the manga of the same name by Yokoyari Mengo, is a medley of darkness, love, despair, and change. As a disclaimer, assuming you haven't watched the anime yet, there is no nudity; however, there are implied sex scenes. Furthermore, it is not your happy-go-lucky romance, but more of a coming of age, realistic tragedy.\r\nStory: 9\r\nAs written in the synopsis here on MAL, the animestarts of with our two main characters, Mugi and Hanabi, who are introduced as substitutes for each others lovers in a physical relationship, otherwise known was \"friends with benefits\". Throughout the anime, Hanabi and Mugi rely on each other for both emotional and physical comfort, as they are unable to pursue their own loves. Kuzu no Honkai has a unique premise, immediately introducing the main characters to be not only intimate, but also uninterested in each other. Furthermore, later in the story, the dialogue portrays realistic representations of human nature, thoughts, and reasoning behind the actions.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of Kuzu no Honkai is excellent. During the anime, lighting is utilized to alter the mood, and transitions of scenes are mastered. The drawings of the characters fit the characterization perfectly, while also offering some eye candy from the attractiveness.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe opening, \"Uso no Hibana\" by 96neko fits the mood and direction of the anime. Tone used in the lyrics fits the dark mood whilst the lyrics represent the anime. Furthermore, the ending, \"Heikousen\" by Sayuri utilizes her voice to lyricize the message of the song. The rhythm and \"catchiness\" of both the opening and the ending also adds to the quality of the anime. The OSTs in Kuzu no Honkai fit the scenes and enhance the mood enough to make the scenes themselves memorable. Filled with a dark undertone, the message of the scenes are conveyed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nIn Kuzu no Honkai, we are presented with what I would say is a focus on six characters. Each character has their own story, and reasons for their love. As each character's story is revealed, and their actions watched, the realistic thought processes of the characters are unraveled. The characterization of said characters is arguably the best quality of Kuzu no Honkai, as realistic actions are utilized in such a way that the viewer feels it is a reality instead of a work of fiction. As some characters are seen as the dark side of human nature, others are seen as the brightest angel. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis section is a personal viewing/opinion. People's tastes vary by user, therefore you may not agree with any part of this review. The melding of the elements presented in Kuzu no Honkai (story, art, characterization, and sound) made for a wonderful experience. I enjoyed the dark themes in the story, mixed with the realistic attribute of modern day romance, and the explanations of the characters' actions. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the reason behind the 10/10 or masterpiece rating is because of the quality and impact that combining the elements of Kuzu no Honkai had on me as a person, and as a fellow viewer of Japanese anime. Thanks for reading my review until the end!\\n\\n\r\nDisclaimer: As a fan of the romance + drama combination, I may be a biased source...but who isn't biased, as \"Love will make you blind.\"",

But hey, at least it's pretty to look at, amirite?\r\nI'm not sure where this anime was trying to go with its story- is it a \"coming of age\" for one to relate to? Is it a visual commentary on society and our fickle desires for that which we cannot have? Is it the path of self-redemption for an A class bitch that slept her way through all 11 episodes, wreaking havoc in her wake? Is it a measly excuse for watching anime characters make out 50%of the show? (No wait, I take that back. Make it 70%.)\\n\\n\r\nBe it what it may, what it IS for certain is a waste of your time. \\n\r\nSeriously. Don't bother. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're a particular breed of masochist that enjoys watching shows filled with self-serving twats that make you want to claw your eyes out more with every passing minute, topped with each of said characters constantly cheating on and sleeping with each other, then by all means, go ahead. There's a difference between flawed, multidimensional, fleshed out characters and these shipwrecks. \\n\\n\r\nIf the plot served any purpose, then I might even be willing to look past that, but alas, there's only room for further disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nProps to some brilliant animation and a mature ending, at the very least.",

Now you ask, why would two pre-pubescent giggly-filled sparkly eyed girls would watch this? Well that's not the point.\r\nAny who, I applaud Kuzu no Honkai for daring to explore the dark sides of 'romance' and breaking away from your seasonal mushy Rom Com.\r\nIn all the drama and such, it probably actually executes its meaning pretty well,\r\nBUUUT\r\nThat doesn't mean it was enjoyable.\r\nMy biggest problem was thecharacters,\\n\\n\r\nI mean seriously at some points they had less sense than an empty piggy bank.\\n\\n\r\nBut then again, I don't expect much from characters from an anime called 'Scum's Wish'\\n\r\nPretty much to describe the relationships of everyone in this anime in one sentence is...\\n\\n\r\nEveryone loves some other person, but they will do anyone.\\n\\n\r\nNow with all the fun I had pointing out the flaws of this anime, I do personally think that it showed well just how empty procreation can be if its not with someone you love.\\n\\n\r\nThen Jersie, if it executed this topic well, why a 5 rating?\\n\\n\r\nLIKE I SAID BEFORE,\\n\\n\r\nIT'S NOT ENJOYABLE.\\n\\n\r\nI would say you are a strange person if you genuinely enjoy extremely over-dramatic teenage drama and seeing them mate like dogs without reason....\\n\\n\r\nI mean, Kuzu no Honkai like I said before executes meaningless procreation well, but\\n\\n\r\nIt's depressing, and uncomfortable and just overall,\\n\\n\r\nTHE LONGEST 12 EPISODES IN MY LIFE, they seriously felt like 2 hours per episode.\\n\\n\r\nBut at least at the end even with all the broken and trampled hearts of the characters, the raging and suffering of the viewers, it manages to tie the ending up...well better than I thought it would.\\n\\n\r\n(BTW I usually rate an anime on its enjoyment of the average viewer)\\n\\n\r\nBut some good things Kuzu no Honkai had going for it, was its good animation, but at least how my best friend would of called it\\n\\n\r\n'The beauty was wasted on it'\\n\\n\r\nIt also had good music, and well yeah that's my review.\\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai had good concepts, but it's still not enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "But before the op even starts, the main characters of Kuzu no Honkai kiss already. With tongue.\r\nThis gives the viewer of good idea the direction this anime is going. Not shoujo. At all. A girl and a boy, their love for two teachers unrequited, seek comfort from each other, fantasizing each other as their crush. Expect a lot of kissing, undressing, and gratuitous scenes. Not being a fan of very intimate actions, I was a little uncomfortable watching. Not to say that these scenes weren't done well. The art is what really distinguished this series for me. The slightly pale water-color palate feel and meticulouslydrawn and animated characters constantly astounds. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the same cannot be said of the story. At first, you get the idea that the characters are struggling with their unrequited feelings, and so let their true, ugly natures into the light. The two mcs admit their most base natures to each other, and there are no lies between each other. The tricky dynamic between the two mcs is actually pretty nuanced and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nUntil everything gets downright abusive. Maybe at the fifth episode or so. Until the anime decides to turn on it's heel right near the end. \\n\\n\r\nI'll not specify anything about the plot, but the sudden character personality changes are rather drastic. The two mcs were lonely, so they sought warmth from each other. The used each other, but it was a contract-like matter between them. \\n\\n\r\nSo where exactly did the mid-anime sudden abusive natures of both mcs come from?\\n\\n\r\nAnd how did these two suddenly get epiphanies, allowing the heretofore miserable and abusive anime to end in sunshine and flowers?\\n\\n\r\nIt was a shame. I thought Kuzu no Honkai began brilliantly, defying conventions and challenging social norms with a unique twist on oft-seen material. But the sudden mid-anime abusive content just made me dislike the mcs too much for me to wish to follow the story. I would have dropped this anime but for its amazing art, but fans of a darker take on love who do not mind abusive relationships and intimate action, this is surely worth a watch.",

            "content": "Overview\r\nKuzu no Honkai was a refreshing surprise, untainted by generic tropes and contemporary tendencies within the genres of drama and romance in \"Chinese cartoons\" ^^. Lets start with a disclaimer, to be honest, if you consider Kimi no Na wa to be the benchmark for drama anime or you consider garbage shows such as Shigatsu, Anohana or Tsuki ga Kirei to be proper romance shows, please for the love of god just dont bother and skip this show. You will just hurt the rating and your feelings in the process of watching (lol). On the other hand, if your tastes are more refined with appetitefor grim and you can appreciate a curveball here and there, go for it.  If you enjoyed Kimi ga Nozomu Eien or School days you will enjoy this show, I can guarantee that. In my humble opinion the show is targeting relatively mature male audiences and their fantasy. For any show to be good you do not necessarily have to like it, neither the show must be properly concluded or the plot must be progressive in the way its structured. I would like to stress the importance of actually watching the whole entirety of a show and making your opinion after. The show stays true to the premise as mentioned in its name and conveys intended message in the purest and clearest way possible. The ending is just great and believable. I stress the word \u201cbelievable\u201d unlike the standard childish drama, over the top feelings and na\u00efve feel-good pathos.\\n\\n\r\nPlot and Characters\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most of the contemporary shows that are based on love triangles and simpler romance structures, here we get something that might be described as an octahedron of romance plot, two main couples with extra cast of characters intervening within the plot and character development. The \"love\" segment is based on mainly very negative emotions such as regret, greed, lust, possessiveness, hatred, but also unconditional love. Indeed, very interesting and combustive mix of emotions. I must say, I would enjoy addition of violence, but that is just me. Do not expect dramatic plot twists and action, the show is very Japanese in the way of how the romance is portrayed via aspect to aspect approach. The reason I enjoyed the shows plot is due to the non-linear structure of the plot, simultaneous regress and progress in the plot via increase and decrease in the emotional tension/intensity that is  not exclusive and happening at the same time on different fronts. In simple terms, multilinear plot can stagnate or regress to be progressive. Every character is developed both externally within the grander narrative of the anime, but also internally by exploring the self and innermost desires. On top of that, this process is believable (rare in anime), due to the characters inability to understand themselves and others. The narration of the plot is multi-perspective and subjective as the story is told and narrated only through the limited view of respective character, therefore being impacted by their bias and limited personal experience. I like the inclusion of sex and basic sexual drive as factor affecting relationships. Despite the fact, that we have the typical retard good guy type MC kun character as part of the cast, other male characters are well written and save the day. The show is not about \"the story\" per say, the story is mediocre or good at best, but the enjoyability of the plot is achieved through the general approach and how it is being told. Same goes for the characters, they are just grim, twisted and realistic not revolutionary or over the top complex, their relatability and enjoyability comes from the small things such as their knowledge of their limited scope of emotional and cognitive capacity. Despite hating a character personally, you must be able to appreciate how the characters fits within the narrative or how the character is non-progressively developed.  Despite the presence of all the character archetypes such as main protagonists, childhood friend, older brother etc. they are developed and explored through unconventional ways. Same applies to the unique and nicely selected emotions that are driving them through the show and are exceptional within the genre.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound\\n\\n\r\nUnlike plot and characters, which can be qualitatively and objectively judged up to some point by some commonly recognised literally standards. Art and Sound is more subjective segment of this review. In such a short show consisting of only 12 episodes there is not much ground for commitment with regard to the quality and complexity of composed tracks or animated pieces. It is the grim drama and romance that carries the show, not epic scenes or shouting MC kun.  The music is fitting and does great job, no complain on that front. OP and ED are nice, but I did not appreciate the increase in tempo of the track that followed the slow start (30 sec in the ED). OP is generic, ED is slightly better. The animation and background were in contrast with the shows atmosphere, nice and vivid with clear definition and good spectrum of pastel colours. Interesting choice, ideal or not is debatable. I personally enjoyed that most of the scenes were grounded in reality without over-utilisation of abstract scenes trying to impact the emotion and intensity of the scene like was done in Ef tale of, series for example. To be clear this is not good or bad, just one of the possible approaches. Lastly, but not least, unless you were a part of anime production team, do not judge the quality of animation and music by the sound director and lead animator. It is just idiotic and retarded to do so, due to the simple reason that it is often just marketing and PR. Unless you have no internal knowledge of up to what extent were the production externalised or who really did what part of the animation process etc. you are just blabbering nonsense. Judge it just by the eye not by the names behind it. Yes they might be brand for the quality, but scene by scene, art by art approach is more logical.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\\n\r\nThe show is just lovely, the plot is being unveiled through fresh approaches and is non-linear, emotional intensity is progressive, regressive and stagnant variably throughout the show and evades common approaches within the genre. Unfortunately within the standard rating system we do not have proper rating tools to appreciate this gem (Such as telling, narration etc). If you disliked the show, wait a few years and watch it again. If the previous is not applicable and indeed you are mature member of the society you might just be sensitive human being with proper moral compass (I envy and pity you at the same time). Getting acquainted with western and eastern movie and cinema might come handy in dissecting controversial anime shows, in the end it is just another visual medium. Kuzu no Honkai is a more mature version of School Days without the unnecessary edge, thus not in need of the impact factor of respective show. Kuzu no Honkai was indeed pleasant surprise where drama and romance was nicely spread throughout the series.\\n",

            "content": "Kuzu no Honkai isn't an anime for everyone. It touches on the taboo, and stays true to its unique narrative. However, this was the first \"drama/romance\" anime to truly catch my eye with its synopsis, and the end product lived up to and exceeded my expectations.\r\n     This is a story filled with disgust, angst, and suffering. The way the story is told makes it your duty to feel everything the characters are meant to feel and then feel a surplus of shock and disbelief that comes from your own frenzied speculation.The characters are overly self-centered and are prone to behave in, seemingly, ridiculous ways. However, each character is built with their own narratives, and each is given a chance to portray their thoughts and emotions to the viewer. This creates the emotional investment that one normally has to a character after seeing them battle through tough opposition and heavy turmoil. Yet, at no point are you inspired to pity any of the people in the story. At no point are you asked to be understanding of their plight, and even so, at every point in the story you beg and plead for these damn kids to do what makes sense. You want the characters to do what you think is right, and in the end they don't.\\n\\n\r\n     At the end of every episode and at the start of a new one, one of the characters makes an entitled, selfish decision that shatters the plan you had created during the break between them. Each character seemingly disregards any external factors and simply gets swept up in their own grief or animosity. But that's what makes it as galvanizing as it is. After all, wouldn't we do the same? Although their actions can come off as hyperbolic, it is only so without the context of their narrative. No one has anything to hold them back from making rash decisions besides their very own conscience. There are countless times in everyday life we ignore our inner voice and do what we feel is right in that moment. Within Kuzu no Honkai, they simply take their unreleased grief and sorrow and channel it into poorly thought-out actions. However, it must be known that they are still too young to truly know better and haven't had any prior experience at dealing with these emotions in a reasonable manner.\\n\\n\r\n     Perhaps I hold Kuzu no Honkai in such high regard because I find its story relatable and its characters loosely justified, but even in its over the top delivery, the message it tries to get across is one that holds meaning. After watching the anime, you should come away with resolve along with all the sorrow. It truly is a bittersweet story from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\n     No matter how badly you want something, perhaps the best thing to do is to let it go and move on. In this tale of unrequited love, we follow the characters through their own unique hardships and their journey to mature and learn what they truly want. Although it seemingly takes ages for them to finally reach a conclusion, it holds true to the path a hurt lover may face. Stuck in an endless loop of suffering, seeing and wanting but never moving forwards, it takes many mistakes and pains for everyone to learn and move on.\\n\\n\r\n     Kuzu no Honkai isn't a story for everyone. But for those who are willing to, or have faced the pain these characters do, it's a wonderfully unfulfilling story that will render you speechless in a variety of ways. Its incredible art and animation, along with its expertly timed soundtrack, are simply more things to captivate you when placed throughout the story.",

            "content": "As you can see, the top reviews are not really praises for the anime/manga. More specifically the plot. Yes, they have an understable point. But for me, this might be one of my best anime I've watched. \r\nKuzu no Honkai captures attention through its dark and very emotional \"type\" of loving someone. You can say it sucks, but you can learn a thing or two. \r\nYou can say it's so exaggerating but that's one point of it, it shows how love can be so powerful to someone that most people think he/she is exaggerating or crazy or an emo creep. Okay? That's what the MugixHanabipairing forte is. \\n\\n\r\nIt shows 4 types of \"love\".\\n\\n\r\nFirst: Shows how not getting your desired love from someone can result loneliness and finding a replacement. Something like finding a rebound guy or girl after a break up, or finding someone in your league to date than to keep on longing for someone out of your league.\\n\\n\r\nTwo: Just for satisfaction,accessory,perks or sex and you got used to it. You lost hope or motivation finding something genuine about it \\n\\n\r\nThree: Because she looks like.. YOUR F%@$%NG MOM! (just kiddin)\\n\r\n          Desiring someone whom you can picture yourself with, doesn't care of flaws. (idk, Kanai PoV is kind of rare to encounter...........\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n UNLESS YOU HAVE A MOTHER COMPLEX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) just kiddin, might be serious because of her being deceased. He wants that love that he can picture as a lover's love as well as a mother's...still doesn't changes the fact that SHE ONLY LOOKS LIKE HER!( next time, if they look like you parents, go for it! Trust me)\\n\\n\r\nFour: Childhood friend cliche, it's very common. I got childhood-friendzoned too :'(\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTBH, you can't relate to it if you haven't felt it. Nowadays love is more of a game to play, you can play it seriously but also just for fun, trolling and etc. Kuzu no Honkai shows how serious feelings can be hurt or healed. You can't appreciate it if you don't dig it deeper (put it in ;)) You can say they're overreacting but it's reality. Try interviewing someone rejected or broken. You say it's exaggerated but that's because it's not as shallow as you typical romance show. \\n\\n\r\nDo you know how it takes gut to confess?\\n\\n\r\nStay strong and hoping to be accepted by your love even if she/he is taken or not ?(not crush, I think it's shallow)?\\n\\n\r\nTry to stay there and support your friend even if she/he rejected you? *moca*\\n\\n\r\nI admire these characters because of those. It didn't intend to show a soap opera, just showed some real life situations.\\n",

            "content": "It is hard to write a review for this anime putting aside my biases, so I wont. I am not even that good a critic, so I won't pretend otherwise. If you are wondering whether to watch the anime, certainly do. I think you owe yourself a very unique experience. There is much good in it and I will tell you what without spoiling anything. So, let's begin.\r\nSo, the premise is very misleading. When I first read it, I expected it to be mostly fanservice (Not that it is necessarily a bad thing. Fanservice can add character sometimes.) but I felt it wasn't my cupof tea. But I watched it because of the quiet hype surrounding it. The first episode certainly didn't disappoint and I must say I loved the show. I expected the show to be a drama that focused on the mental states and internal conflicts of its cast, and the show delivered. It handles its characters maturely, even the minor characters were given their share of development.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is very melancholic and kicks in only when needed. I think that is an art and it deserves to be praised. The OP and ED are not your run-of-the-mill stuff and fit the mood of the whole show to the T. I can't talk any more about the sound without bringing in the cinematography and how the two manage to make a series completely on monologue engaging. I found Death Note a litte annoying because there was nothing for my eyes to focus on besides the facial expressions of the characters. I like that Kuzu no Honkai has so much movement even if it something petty like multiple shots zipping across screen. It showed the thought that went into making the show. Hats off, Lerche!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is fairly pretty and the voice acting (no dub as of this review) is superb. Given the lack of action, Lerche went all out in trying to hold the viewers attention. There were episodes I didn't feel like paying attention but the anime engages you on a level that you can understand the overarching theme without effort. The more intricate details of the plot can be hard to grasp but that requires more dedication. I won't blame Lerche for keeping it so because of the nature of the show. It urges one to ponder over the characters and try to understand them better.\\n\\n\r\nI completely stand by my high rating for the show. I wanted to give it a 10 to offset all the negative reviews, but since this show has touched me so deeply, I wanted to keep it real. I look forward to watching other shows that Lerche makes. A big \"THANK YOU\" to the people who made this anime...I mean EVERYONE!",

            "content": "WARNING: spoilers for the first couple of episodes ahead. See the last paragraph for a short, non-spoiler mini review.\r\nTypically, in anime, they decide to look at the more loving side of a relationship. Whether there be happy times or sad time, they always tend to look at the love that the characters share. It's very rare for anime to step outside of this comfort zone and make something much darker. Something that follows a relationship without any love involved. Something that looks at the romance genre in a new angle. That, my friend, is the premise of Kuzu no Honkai.\r\nKuzu no Honkai follows the taleof Hanabi and Mugi as they decide to get in a relationship after their respective crushes (teachers) begin to show interest in each other. To everyone else, they seem like a normal, ideal couple, but, in reality, they do not love each other at all and are using each other as \"substitutes\". This means that they partake in activities that lovers would usually do together and, yes, that includes almost having sex in very awkward fan service sequences for all you perverts out there (I know you\u2019re there). As the story unfold, more and more characters get involved in this big mush of a relationship, until, inevitably, they all turn into walking pieces of human trash. Okay, maybe not all of them become that bad, but my point still stands.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are what\u2019ll either make you love this series, or hate it. Along with the previously mentioned Mugi and Hanabi, there is also Sanae, Akane, Narumi and Noriko. \\n\\n\r\nSanae is a girl that is very much in love with Hanabi, although she has accepted the fact that she cannot be in a romantic relationship with her... So, she decides loveless sex is fine instead. Makes sense. \\n\\n\r\nAkane is Mugi\u2019s crush and a music teacher at their school. She used to be Mugi\u2019s private teacher as a kid and is also the worst type of human being imaginable. She gets off on the fact that other people want her. She especially loves wooing men that someone else already has romantic feelings for. She\u2019s a slut that will sleep with one man on Tuesday and then another two on Wednesday. She\u2019s truly the worst of the worst.\\n\\n\r\nNarumi is Hanabi\u2019s crush and older childhood friend, whom she calls \u201conii-chan\u201d. He is currently working at the school and is Hanabi\u2019s homeroom teacher. Adding insult to injury, he is quite obviously in love with Akane and does not even bother trying to hide it. He is currently unaware of Hanabi\u2019s feelings.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, there is Noriko. She is Mugi\u2019s childhood friend and has been in love with him for years. She is a completely useless character that adds nothing to the story besides more heartbreak and despair. They could have gotten rid of her completely and almost nothing would have changed.\\n\\n\r\nEach character is unique and brings something interesting to the table, besides Noriko. although they may not always be the most likable of people, they are almost always fascinating to watch. You can\u2019t help but both root for them to live happy lives and wish that they just fuck off already at the same time. Maybe I\u2019m just a sadomasochist, but I absolutely loved this about Kuzu no Honkai.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is one of the prettiest art styles that I have seen in anime to this date. The soft water colours give off a melancholic vibe that I simply cannot describe. The way that the anime slowly turns into a picturesque painting of a scene during an emotional moment has a huge effect on how I\u2019m feeling during a specific moment, especially as it emphasises on a single way that it wants you to feel. It\u2019s truly a beauty to behold.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is phenomenal. The soundtrack perfectly fits the atmosphere of the anime and represents what it\u2019s all about. The opening song \u201cUso no Hibana\u201d is beautiful. Sang by 96Neko, it gets across the point of despair and rejection, whilst also showing the viewer the power of moving on and the substitutions throughout the series. Despite how amazing this OP is, the ED, \u201cHeikousen\u201d somehow manages to top it. Never before has an ending song had such an emotional impact on me than this one has. Hearing this song at the end of every episode is truly something special. Definitely one of the best ending songs out there in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nFun fact: If you reverse the kanji of the opening song's name (\u5618\u306e\u706b\u82b1), you will get Hanabi no Uso (\u82b1\u706b\u306e\u5618), which translates to Hanabi's Lies. It makes a lot of sense when you think about it.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m no expert in voice acting, so I\u2019ll keep this part short. The voice actors do an amazing job at portraying their respective characters and quite easily get across how they are feeling at that exact moment, without breaking out of character.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Kuzu no Honkai is a fantastic anime. It dares to do what a lot of other anime are too afraid to do. Explore the dark nature of love. The characters are amazing, being both entertaining and heart-breaking to watch, the art is absolutely beautiful, and the music Is a joy to the ears. To some, it may be a very uncomfortable show that\u2019s a pain to sit through to the end, but to others, it may just be a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nHope that helped.\\n",

Honestly for you all who say this is so realistic, TAG yourself and let me know.\\n\\n\r\nSubjectively, I can\u2019t relate since as a high school teen I have no life outside of trying to do my maths homework. Yes, love is a very complicated feeling and such but the anime results in sorting every problem by having sex, like, that\u2019s unhealthy yo\\n\\n\r\nObjectively, some of the sex scenes was just unnecessary, hey we need to throw in a sex scene for the sake of fan service so that the horny kids will keep watching. Sex scenes are fine when it\u2019s done correctly, certainly not in some case. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationships were a mess, the characters themselves lack communication, it annoyed me when Mugi thought to himself that he can\u2019t tell Moka that he isn\u2019t the prince she imagined he\u2019d be \u2013 WHICH HE TOTALLY COULD, DO YOU REALISE HOW MUCH EASIER THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN you just want to have sex with her stop with the bloody excuses.

The art is quite nice with the still frames every so often, the sakura scenes are pretty.\\n\\n\r\nThe synopsis of the show sounds a lot more interesting, it\u2019s a shame that it didn\u2019t do it justice and did not tackle the topic well. That said, it\u2019s not fully terrible, the end of the story [Spoiler] actually pulled the score up for me (not sure if I just wanted it over, nevertheless) the fact that the two part ways is like thank lord go find yourself get out of this horrible loop, but the process of the anime was a pain, the huge chaos and the ntr oh god I\u2019m ending it here before I spiral into the void bye.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: Back from ep1 of the live action, why did they make a live action of this, god it's awful",

            "content": "I've noticed the main reviews for Kuzu no Honkai mostly give it mediocre results, citing the fact that it appears to be mostly just 'scum for scum's sake'; i.e just to make the viewers feel bad for the sake of being bad. I'd like to rectify that.\r\nKuzu no Honkai/Scum's Wish is painful. There's no way around that. It's a show whose very premise is the pain of unrequited love and all the dregs and drama that come with that. Do I think that the painful nature of Scum's Wish is something that makes it quite a lot of the time relatively 'unenjoyable' to watch? Yes.Do I think that detracts from the value and 'good' of the show? Not at all. I'll attempt to explain why I think Scum's Wish is one of the best shows that deals with the nitty gritty pains of love, and why I think it deserves a lot more recognition than simply being branded 'depression porn' or 'popular for nothing'.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'll attempt to avoid the majority of spoilers here, but the essence of me giving this such a high rating is the fact that Scum's Wish does, in fact, resolve it's painful initial premise. Not only that, but the long, drawn out, and painful road to that resolution is supremely done in a way that makes the ending make 'sense'. \\n\\n\r\nI've noticed a lot of shows, for better or for worse, tend to simplify people in love by having them forget, or quickly move past past misgivings and the like. Scum's Wish takes a very human approach in that people don't forget. People hold grudges, especially when it comes to something as nebulous as love. The main characters sometimes come to grips with the fact that their desires or actions are wholly antipithal to what they previously said or wanted, and sometimes they don't. The arbitrary nature of people in desperate love is just that, arbitrary. Mugi, Hanabi, Ecchan, Moka, 'Onii-chan', and Akane-sensei don't need their actions to be logical in order to be real. \\n\\n\r\nI've heard people say, regarding to one of the characters, that they can't understand why they'd do X, Y, or Z. And I feel like this is one of the relative downfalls of Scum's Wish, and why I wouldn't rate it a perfect 10. It heavily depends on being relatable to the viewer. The entire story, with all of its contrivances, rely on the viewer being able to understand and empathize, rather than sympathize, with what some of the characters are going through. I won't lie, I heavily empathized with a lot of the characters and that probably aided in my own view of the show, and I understand at the same time that people who have been uh, lucky enough, to not 'understand', may not see the show in the same light.\\n\\n\r\nSo while I understand that many people may find the story of Scum's Wish incomprehensible and purely depressing material for depressive's sake, I would contend that it very capably addresses what some could call the 'darker side' of love and romance. The pain, the betrayal, the envy, the passion, the loneliness. \\n\\n\r\nDoes Scum's Wish's story play heavily on what are arguably the most depressing aspects of the human experience regarding love? Yes. Do I think that because of this, it's just depression porn? No, because it does in fact have quite a satisfying 'ending'. One that makes logical sense and shows quite a remarkable development on the part of the main characters if you look back on the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe only real reason I'm not giving the story a full 10 is because of this emphasis on empathy, and also because the 'resolution' felt slightly too quickly wrapped up.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here because it mostly relates to the manga, so I'll try to keep it succinct. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure if many other people pick up on this, but to me the main aspect of the show's design (reflected and picked up from the manga) are the main characters' eyes. I've joked with some friends who also watched the show that the eyes of the main characters always seem 'dead' in some way or another. There's something about the flat colouring of the eyes, mixed with the gradient colour shift towards black from whatever their normal eye colour is that makes each characters' eyes so charming. It's probably the most defining feature of Scum's Wish visually, from a character design point of view at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main thing to talk about are the scene transitions. Like the manga, Scum's Wish uses a transition of a fade to black using a variety of effects, most usually drops of black onto the screen that spread and eventually cover the whole screen. It's obvious that these are teardrops, spreading across a page of a part of the story. It's a really nice stylistic element that adds to each scene transition, no matter how it's used.\\n\\n\r\nJust a final note about the animation in general; Lerche did a good job in maintaining the style of the manga. A lot of the colouring is flat, and the character designs are basically the same as the manga, and as such are on point. Not much to elaborate here.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the few places I'll give Scum a full 10 score, is sound. The choices of OP and ED are utterly fantastic, especially in Sayuri's rendition of Heikousen, or Parallel Lines. The lyrics suit the show's story and characters so much that its practically a spoiler to talk about them, so I won't go into a lot of detail about that. But both OP and ED capture essential feelings to Scum's Wish, and pull it off really well to the point that hearing each song illicits a pang of \\n\r\nfeeling in your chest. Whatever that feeling is, is up to the viewer, but being so capable of heavily associating with the core essentials of Scum's Wish give it a perfect score in that department.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the sound and use of music throughout the show itself, again, it's pretty much perfect. It's usually orchestral to some degree, but there's some vocal pieces thrown in, and they're usually on point in portraying either what the scene is portraying, or what the underlying subtext of the scene is. That may sound confusing, but as a little spoilery example, the music that usually plays during some of the more 'explicit' scenes between Mugi and Hanabi, are not happy or passionate at all. The moderately somber, minor tone reflects the fact that this is still a relationship of convenience between the two. Long drawn out strings are practically perfect in conveying the combating emotions of loneliness, desire, passion, and pain.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the most contentious part about Scum's Wish. As I've mentioned in my scoring of the story, the experience of the characters all heavily depend on relatability to some degree or another; if you don't empathize with at least one or some of the characters and the situations they're in, you will despise each and every one of them for being ridiculous in the way they approach practically everything.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I would contend that from an empathetic point of view, each main character in Scum's wish is beautifully crafted and written. Each occupy different enough aspects of the phenomenon known as 'love' that likely someone could relate to at least one of the characters, and perhaps acknowledge the pain of a few others. \\n\\n\r\nI don't think its really fair to write off a character you don't necessarily like in Scum as just that, Scum. Or more importantly, Scum that deserve nothing. Whilst each character gets some form of 'redemption' by the end of the series, they're all motivated to do what they do throughout the series by very human emotions. Love, jealousy, hate, desire, loneliness, wanting. They're not glamorous emotions, certainly not portrayed as such in Scum's wish, but nobody's going to be perfect, at least not in Scum's Wish. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters all pursue their own goals for themselves, no matter how much they may be hurting themselves or others in the long run. If you watch Scum's Wish, you shouldn't be expecting a nice and happy turnaround in the likes of Toradora or other rom-coms that leave your heart aflutter with mushy pink-tinged joy. I'm not disparaging those shows or those that like them, I'm part of that crowd myself, but Scum's Wish's characters cut so deeply to the core that I'm obliged to regard them as some of the most 'realistic' in a lot of senses. Hence the perfect score.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nJust a short note here, but as I've stated numerous times in this review; Scum's Wish heavily depends on the relatability that the viewer has towards any one of the characters. If you relate to none of them, you may find the show very difficult to take seriously as anything other than a depression circle-jerk. If you relate to one of them, you may find yourself going \"God no, I don't need these memories. But it's done so well.\" Or you may be in the unenviable position like I am, of being able to relate to multiple characters. Hence, I 'enjoyed' the show to the fullest. 10/10 barely accounts for how much I deeply connect with the show. My liver may not be thanking me for the amount of times I've painfully had to indulge in alcohol to numb the pain of bad memories brought up by this show, but no other show has done that so I'm willing to give Scum's Wish significant sway in that regard. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSummary/Overall: 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nI've probably made clear why I think Scum's Wish deserves a far better reputation and review score than I've seen it get. Again, the only real thing preventing me from giving this a full 10/10 is the fact that it relies so heavily on the characters and their situations being relatable for a viewer to empathize. Do I think that should cause my rating to be dropped more because of it? Not at all. People have genres or themes that they will not watch because they can't get invested enough in it or simply don't find it 'interesting', and I think this applies to Scum's Wish. Someone may quickly find it unenjoyable, but someone else who can relate may find it immediately intriguing. I do not think a show should simply be written off because you may not be able to 'understand' the motivations of a character or characters. \\n\\n\r\nI'll reiterate, Scum's Wish is painful. It's a show that dredges up pretty much all the negative aspects of love, and all its undoings. But it does have a positive resolution. One that makes sense, and is a testament to how far the characters have come from their initial entry. I jokingly mentioned to some friends that Scum's Wish would end in a murder suicide because one of the characters couldn't take the frustrations and anger of their situation any more. I'm genuinely glad that the series resolved as it did, in quite a mature way considering how the first half dozen episodes went, and I would summarily consider it one of the greatest shows dealing with a 'real' sense of love, that is, one that isn't completely blotted out with rose-tint and deals heavily with the times that we, as people, feel shitty, lonely, and terrible about ourselves.\\n\\n\r\nScum may be scum, but they also have wishes too. And if they're capable of superseding that, who are we to judge if we cannot say the same?\\n\\n",

It's as if it conveys us all the Negative Feelings and seeks to find out the true message of Happiness.\r\nA thing should also be noted that we as audience fell in love with the characters such as Hanabi & Mugi without much effort given in the plot.The anime has a ring to it that the relations that wemake in society may not last forever thus even if we face a new beginning we should be ready to break ties to move forward.\\n\r\nThere is one word for this Anime \"MasterPiece\".\\n\r\nThe MOST SHOCKING OF ALL is that people who love watching High School DxD, Love Ru, Koi to Uso are back bitching about this anime(LOL). I mean com-mon Dude grow up and look around you. You can smell the roses such as High School DxD and avoid this anime as a \"PLAGUE\" but it wouldn't make you any wiser.If wanna be a critic then go after some other anime!!\\n\r\nAm I the only one who gets the anime or What?\\n\r\nIf you find this Review useful then Please Like it.",

The characters think if they do not have sex and sexual relationships their life is meaningless (let's just ignore making real friends because friends with benefits are cool)\r\n2.) Who the fuck in high school has that much time?? These kids are slackers and are probably going to live in a box after high school... \r\n3.) Why the fuck is that female teacher a teacher and not a leech off of some successful business man withher \"smarts\" in \"manipulating men\" to like her\\n\r\n4.) If you wanted to make a porno why not go all the way and cut away this fucking dumbass story??\\n\r\n5.) The mindset \"My life is so bad I have no friends and I keep on having sex all the time b/c that's what life is about\" makes me wanna kms that people like this exist (as other reviewers have said) (kinda similar to point 1 I guess, but the point is that the show is a cringefest for any intellectual who knows a thing or two about life and relationships) (shoutout to all the starving african children who would actually work hard)\\n\r\n6.) Why is trying to fuck underage girls a thing in Japan @ guy who knows nothing but sex who had sex with the female teacher who knows nothing but sex\\n\r\n7.)

The drama present in this anime deosn't appeal to everyone, alot of watchers will be mad and frustrated with the characters and their actions, but others will probably find a liking to it. I personally really loved this show and now I'm going to tell you why.\r\n~Story\r\nThe story of Scum's Wish is dark. It's filled with unrequited crushes, lonelyness, pain and other things of this sort. It shows us the dark side of love, but also gives us some comedy here and there. The pacing is good and the anime stayed close to the original manga.It also isn't afraid to show some expilcit scenes, which had a purpose and weren't bothering me atleast. I overall really liked the story ^^.\\n\\n\r\n~Art\\n\r\nArt and animation are really pretty and look great. I also really like the use of paneling in this show. It makes it stand out and is a really unique way, that haven't seen explored in other shows that much. Even though i have to admit, that i like the manga-artstyle a little more, they tried capturing the original style as much as possible.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound\\n\r\nI really liked the OST and after the show finished airing I listened to it multiple times and fell in love with alot of the tracks (for example the one from ep. 11).\\n\\n\r\n~Characters\\n\r\nAll of them have some sorts of unrequited and dark feelings in them (exept one or two), this allone makes them in many ways relateable. None of them are really good and nice people, but this makes them good written characters in a sense. All of them (exept one or two) go trough a developement and at the end of the series all of them (exept one or two) learn from their experience and grow because of it. The character designs are also really pretty, simple and good on the eye. (And Hanabi is super pretty. So pretty, that i already drew her alot lol)\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun watching this anime. There were times were i enjoyed the show more than at over times, but was it a really good experience nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\n~Overall\\n\r\nAs already said, this anime might not appeal to everyone and i already heard people say, that it was too much drama for them, but I really liked Scum's Wish. It is a show, that i won't forget that easily.\\n\r\nI give it a solid 9/10. I really loved this show and I can recommend it to some, but not to everyone.\\n",

As a girl, I enjoyed it critically just as much as the next person, even if the original reason I watched it was because I saw a cute guy and a clip of a kiss scene. \r\nThis show is very mature in terms of character development where we get characters from all walks of life facing their emotions in all the wrong ways. Itwas fascinating to watch them discover the true meaning behind the concept of lust and love, and the difference between the two emotions. The show reflects the worst archetypes of people in society and present them in a relatable way. Yes, the characters do scummy things, yes, the show will make you hate at times, but that is what will draw you into watching the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe aim of the show is to get you to see the negative aspects of the characters personalities and recognise then within yourself. When watching it I felt I could really relate to the female protagonist, as I had struggled in the past in discovering whether I was in love with a person, or the idea of them. What makes the show even better is the use of panels in the animation and the overall simplistic design, as this not only stayed true to the popular manga, but drew attention to the characters emotion. Even just a zoomed in panel of a character's eyes gave us as an audience enough information as to the doubts about the decisions that character was making. This is a marvel of a show that has presented mature themes in a mature way that I have never witnessed from a show before. I'm sure this show, and the lessons I learned from it about myself, will stay ingrained in my mind for many years to come. It's definitely worth watching.",

But as it progressed, things got hectic. The show turned into a shit show and I constantly found myself saying, ''Oh. Another new character we get to dedicate the entirety of the episode to.'' And in the end, they ended up just being really irrelevant. If the show cut off the unnecessary side character back stories, it would of been reduced to like 6 episodes. I shit you not. I feellike they only kept them in there because it's either sad or there's sex involved. I also get the vibe that the creator made all these characters with their traits and backstories and what not, but couldn't make up his mind as to who to pair them up with so he was like, ''Hey. Let's just make a super confusing love triangle and make everyone kiss each others asses for 12 episodes. Deal?'' I can't really say if I prefer the manga over the anime, for it might be the same confusing shit show. But I probably will spare my money the confusion and angry emotions. This show had a lot of potential but at the end, you feel nothing. No sadness or happiness or anything. There was no message or true point or climax in this story. My feelings for this anime was pretty mediocre because quite frankly, it was kind of bad. But it had a lot of potential if they buffed and cleaned it up a bit.",

            "content": "What if i told you there was a softcore porn anime with the inanity of School Days and all the \"artsy\" pompousness of Shigatsu?  If you have a modicum of taste, you may look at me in disbelief, wondering why anybody would birth that kind of abomination.  Yet here we are, Kuzu no Honkai is very much real, and every bit as dreadful as you can imagine.  But miraculously, KNH is entertaining, precisely because it is bad.  \r\nThe concept is simple : we have here a cast of characters who do nothing but have sex with each other in random andever changing permutations.  The catch is that none of them enjoy having sex or even yearn for it.  No, they just do it because the authors decided that it would have some sort of \"deep\", life-changing significance.  While it may fly for the 13 year old female viewers, those of us who are older and more jaded will realize it to be the pinnacle of pretentious stupidity.  And that's the story.  No really, that's it.  There is no real conflict, no accomplishment, and no progression.  Just a bunch of idiots having sex and getting petty and jealous for nearly 5 hours. \\n\\n\r\nUp to now it must still sound pretty awful and you must wonder how i could find any entertainment in this.  The key lies in the execution.  I'm not exaggerating at all when i say that 75% of the show is characters having inner, sappy, whispery monologues.   It's so annoying and bad, that i couldn't actually get annoyed by it.  Rather, i was amazed and bewildered, wondering how low it could get.  I was on the edge of my seat with a chronometer, seeing what is the longest shitty monologue, seeing if it would set a new record.  It's a bit like Poe's law.  But here it's somehow more organic than a pure parody, because it wasn't intended to be.  It's just one because i decided it to be, as the viewer.  \\n\\n\r\nPart of these monologues are what i call epiphanies.  You know, when character A says something really inane, but the writers decided that it would instead be a \"deep\" statement, then character B launches on a 5 minute tirade about how he finally realized \"something\".  Every character has at least 10 of these throughout the series, since they spend most of their time introspecting about themselves.  And it became a game for me to try to anticipate when would be the next epiphany, or to count how many they could cram in a single episode.  \\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, the characters.  In all likelihood, you will hate every single one of them.  I mean, what is more annoying than teenagers who do nothing but internally whine about their free-of-real-conflict lives?  But here the despicable characters are an asset.  I don't know about you, but i enjoy seeing people i hate suffer, and KNH really delivers that type of satisfaction.  Don't expect true pain though, just woe-is-me depression over yesterday's \"life-altering\" sexual encounter.  But it was enough for me, if i couldn't enjoy their sadness, i could at least laugh at them.  \\n\\n\r\nBut really the show's strongest point are the pretentious little artsy devices that are densely sprinkled throughout.  You know, like when a tear falls from a character's face and falls into an abstract background and creates water ripples.  Or when the screen cuts out to a black background with some very \"deep\" 2 words in the middle that some character then says after a long pause, with all the dramatic intent he can muster.  You know what i mean.  These were profoundly hilarious to me.  Just one cliche after another, and there is so many of them that it just adds to the humor.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother source of entertainment is the visuals.  The art is very good, with lots of details.  Eyelashes are meticulously drawn, not just a thick black line.  The hair actually looks like hair and not just a piece of hard, colored plastic.  At the beginning, there are also some top notch lewd scenes.  This isn't your 100$ budget hentai, and one of your only chances at seeing a properly detailed and animated kiss in an anime.  Unfortunately, as usually happens, they concentrate the explicit stuff in the first 1-2 episodes to reel you in, then barely include any in the later parts of the show.  \\n\\n\r\nSo to summarize, KNH is a true gem in the \"good because it's bad\" category.  The problem is that it gets old pretty quickly, due to, well, nothing happening or changing.  The lewdness tapering off also contributed to make this a test of patience to get to the end.  If you are able to put yourself on 3-4 layers of irony, i would recommend watching the first 2-3 episodes, and stopping there.  You will have seen all there is to see.",

It was uncomfortable to watch, really, but this factor subsided quickly. I, for one, skipped most of the scenes because they've lost their reason to even be shown. To be able to convey everything I mean with the least spoilers, I'll break the review down to 4 parts: the beginning, climax, end, and my overview of the series along with the characters.\r\nStarting from the beginning, the facial expressions really did add a lot to keep me entertained, especially giving viewers a quickbut not clear view of the problem our characters will face. Since the first few episodes are the most critical ones, Kuzu no Honkai executed things perfectly to show viewers what's wrong without letting it decay in such an early point.\\n\\n\r\nAt its peak, it somewhat felt lacking. Of course this isn't a review without anything bad said about it. In a show where sentiments basically kept it moving, I wondered where all of those went. During its final episodes, we see the show move on two different paths, not coinciding with each other. We see Hanabi's and Mugi's time alone in one episode but I wonder, where would the climax be? Could it be with Akane? Or with Sanae? You see, you can split a show in two but somehow, to achieve a peak, you have to tie them together. The climax is the quintessential part of a show, but would it be up to the viewers to decide where and who's path it would be? The problem here is that their actions don't affect the other. [SPOILERS] Hanabi's confession to Narumi did nothing to change anything about Akane's night with Mugi. And I'm not blaming the show for that, it's just that it was written in a way that didn't really matter to the other. And even so, where did Mugi's \"know-it-all\" senses go? I thought they agreed to get rejected? In my view, their failed confessions could've been a good peak, but somehow, the character development went one-sided.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the end, I would say, it's painful to watch, but it's the best for them both. The decision to go for a neutral route and not ride onto the momentum of [SPOILER] Narumi and Akane's engagement was not just a great idea but also a great closure. This also keeps the show bound to realism. Remember that even though they wanted to start an actual relationship after getting rejected, Mugi's disobedience to their agreement showed that their decisions were rather forced, or was meant to fill the hole that's about to be made from their rejections. In a deeper understanding, they knew that trying to be an actual couple would actually just be doing what they've done in the start of show: to be a replacement for the people they can't have. So that's why searching for \"true love\" was the best ending for them both and I couldn't've wanted it any other way.\\n\\n\r\nAs an overview of this sad, twisted tale of star-crossed lovers, I would say, it couldn't've been done any better (except for the inclusion of a peak). The frustration, deception, and feeling of being lost were accurate enough to be considered realism instead of the cliche this show's filled of. Kuzu no Honkai isn't a series where you'll see a lot of laughs, or high-schoolers acting stupidly. This show is as serious as it gets. It bathes in sadness so much that you develop empathy even for the characters that's barely looked at. The show explores metaphorical loss but can be felt just as \"emptening\" as \"Clannad\", \"AnoHana\", and other heavy drama shows.\\n\\n\r\nOn a final note, I can only hope to see more shows such as Kuzu no Honkai. Nowadays, those shows are a rare find as most studios focus on Action or Fantasy genres that you really can't see a \"down-to-earth\" show anywhere this season.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, hats off to Kuzu no Honkai. You've almost accurately portrayed the feelings and emotions etched with \"young love\" that a lot of people only despise as shallow and turbulent thoughts. This, is realism. And this is how failed romances should be.",

            "content": "This anime honestly made me more angry than i have been in years. My hands are literally shaking as I am writing this review out of pure and raw frusturation and disgust. This anime... sucks. It's not good. It was the most pretentious and boring thing i've ever had the displeasure of pirating off of some illegal websit-- i mean legally purchasing.\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nThis show does not understand the rule of, \"Show, don't tell\"\r\nI feel like, in a good show, everything that this show accomplishes in 12 episodes could be accomplished in maybe 4 or 5. But this show decides that audience enjoyment isn't really allthat important because it sports the slowest and most drawn out scenes I have ever scene. The show is like listening to an obnoxious teenage girl go on about her problems for hours and hou-- wait thats basically EXACTLY what this anime is. Characters go on and on about their thoughts and feelings so often that it becomes tiring VERY quickly. This show is all like, \"ooh ooh look at how interesting and deep all these characters are! Oh they dont even understand their own emotions! isnt that neat?\" I dont need an anime to spend 12 episodes explaining to me that human beings are complex. I know. I happen to be one. It almost seems like human beings werent even the target audience. Thats how bad it is. I literally cannot think of who this series was aimed towards.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show's single saving grace is that it is, at the very least, visually appealing. The backgrounds are very pretty, and I think the colors and lighting do a very good job in establishing the mood. The show also has an interesting editing style that does a decent job setting the tone for certain scenes and events. Some scenes also have a particular attention to detail in the art and animation, which is always nice to see. Unfortunately, those scenes often fail to have the intended emotional weight to them due to the lackluster story and pacing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music, while not bad, seems out of place. It's an overly emotional soundtrack that seems like its trying to evoke some sort of emotion out of the vewier. However, when the story and characters are so horribly uninteresting, the music just seems cheesy and pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the voice acting has this weird realistic sound to it. I get that this show is supposed to somewhat grounded in reality, but its just so boring. Maybe, if the characters were more interesting, I could have put up with the deadpan performances. However, it just makes the entire experience all the more bland.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nYou cannot have a successful drama without interesting characters. Without interesting characters, the themes and ideas that are explored will not have a lasting effect on the viewer. Characters serve as the bridge between ourselves and the fictional world of the story. Without that bridge, you end up with a confusing disconnect between the viewer and the story.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime does not have good characters. They all are so boring. so incredibly boring. NONE of the characters have any beleivable chemistry. NONE of them are interesting to watch. NONE of them make me interested in the story. There is ONE character that at least breaks the norm and isnt headachingly bland, but her character motivations are so completely over the top that it just seems way too out of place in an anime like this. The characters also are way too emotional to the point that they're just unlikable. No one in the world talks like they do. The characters are not believable at ALL and are just so uninteresting and out of place that the entire experience is just an absolute chore to sit through.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI didnt enjoy it. I'm honestly getting tired of writing this review. This series doesn't even deserve the time it takes to write one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat more is there to say, really? It was boring, pretentious, slow, overly-emotional to the point where its almost comical, and just a bad time overall. I do not recommend this show to anyone. I cannot believe this show was nominated for best drama of 2017.\\n\\n",

Oh boy, I ain't touching that\r\n-Normally that is how it would've gone for me but it's too late, I already crossed the Rubicon. Ahhh! Yarashi! I've awakened to the NTR fetish!\r\nOops I got carried away. And no it won't awaken your cuckoldry inside. Rather it'd make you hate it. The story was magnificently laid out, however it could've been better. If there is anything notably remarkable with this story, it's the character development, but that is also where it falls short. I think the author could've done such developments without delving into the NTRzone, but meh, that is what makes it Kuzu no Honkai.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting character in here is Hanabi, she is as human as she gets, weak and in need of warmth (or is it just my delusion that all girls want sex? i don't really know ._.). Selfish and egoistic, she wants what she wants, and the story pretty much tries to figure - how far would she go for her own - scum's wish.\\n\\n\r\nBeware, the bell toils for thee, this is not for the faint-hearted, but at the end of the road, you might discover something unknown before\\n\\n\r\n - NTR fetish???!!!! Nah, just kidding.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn't watch the last three episodes, why? The story wraps up in episode 9 and I lost all motivation to go further. Not because it was bad, but rather because it was already so good at that point. I felt that it had achieved its raison d'etre and perfection by this time. Yep that is another picture frame on my 'wall for perfect animes.' Teehee\\n\r\nOverall: 11/10 Idk for you, but this is the best romance anime for me, this would satisfy realists the best.\\n",

If you are someone who is going through relationships, don't know how to cope with unrequited love, or are even depressed to some extent. I highly suggest you watch it.

            "content": "Short as it is, the introduction of Kuzu no Honkai. It begins with the unrequited love and desire to be with someone that they can't have. It leads them to form a promise together as lover. By doing so, they can embrace each other as they imagine it's the person they love. Both are falling for the teachers in their school. Mugi loves Akane-sensei who exhibits the elegance (and quite his type). Hana loves Kanai-sensei who's so dear with her since she was a child. Of course, those problematic feelings are intercalated by other characters feelings (love) too. They are ironicallytrapped in scum's wish to be with the one that they can't be with...\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - CHARARACTERIZATION\\n\r\n    I'm not an enthusiast in drama & romance. In fact, I'm very selective when I do watch the genres. I picked this, put it into my must-watch list right after finishing the 1st ep. \"This anime is really heavy,\" what was I thought. From the intro in the 1st ep, it is very clear all ep won't be full of affection. It's indeed the story that will rip the smile apart (moreover if you like to pair one with each other, be prepared).\\n\r\n     The timing they use to bring things up is perfect. Like when the teacher meets with the main characters unexpectedly, the confession of Hanabi's friend, the yelling of Moka, accidental meeting with minor characters and many more. It goes smooth yet, once again, heavy. The story tries to make us understood how having such a dear feeling like love can be \u200bmentally sickening, reeling. It makes us think which side is right or wrong, what is more appropriate to do. Everyone here has their own basic reasoning in which supporting every deeds they do, nobody is wrong. They have different fears and kind of emotions to face, but it's all categorized the same \"to someone they love\". Weak mental stability can easily get stabbed every time the soliloquies appear, it's pretty distressing yet beautifully described.\\n\r\n     Those characters. both in major and minor characters categories, are round type. All of them change along the story progress. It's shown by how mentally wounded their soul in soliloquies and therefore it changes themselves, like their thoughts, opinions, perspective, decisions, not to mention, feelings. Their characters development is progressive, as well as the characterization from other characters to each other in the meantime. The characters development shows the beginning 'til the end of the time they face their own problems and priority to what path they are going to choose and do.\\n\r\n\u200b\\n\\n\r\nVISUALIZATION\\n\r\n     The visualization sync perfectly notable when it's the soliloquies when flow of the words describing the feeling and nuance really makes sense. It's logic from mind and it's understandable from heart. The words or thoughts itself are painful, killing. Almost every time the soliloquies fade away, it jumps to another scene or back to reality, the closure feels like we're drawn to sink with its somber ideas. The close-up characters faces are good, the male characters are plenty while parts of female characters face are graceful. Well, about the ecchi scenes itself, which are more than just enough ('till its get denouncement for its sexual content), is notable. It's great from the visualization and story. It's not in a rush to engage in intimate doing, slowly and in a logical way with clear reason why it puts there. I don't think there's no harm from this series from the beginning because it's already claimed that the genres would be ecchi and seinen too. I thought everyone should pay attention more to it and increase the awareness of it. Well, whatever tho' XD The surrounding visualization is ornamented well, soft yet resolute colouring with subtle contour. The slow motion is the best when they're getting contradiction within themselves.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC\\n\r\n      The meaningful lyrics from the theme songs are killing, it always burns up the feelings there and make it heavier. It can make you cry if you really into the story (or at least quite sensitive). \u200bThe insert songs (instruments) really play along, support well the tension when Hanabi and other characters are feeling themselves in The edge of frustration. The OP is sung by 96neko, one of my favorite because of her lower voice yet firm, \"Uso no Hibana (\u5618\u306e\u706b\u82b1)\". It's worth to say it's one of the best theme songs in WINTER 2017 season. Then, we have the ED by Sayuri \"Heikousen (\u5e73\u884c\u7dda)\". As the OP, it also has meaningful theme songs. Makes us feel that the characters can have everything but their feelings, like they signed the pact to make the person s/he likes happy, but wanted themselves to be saved pathetically.\\n\\n\\n\r\n     Kuzu no Honkai brings sudden revolution to drama & romance genres, even with R+ (mild nudity) scenes. It opens the possibility to understand more the basic reasoning of someone's doing regardless of how slut or weak s/he is in the name of love. The scums' wishes dreadfully about love and people existence, it rocks 9++!\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nThis is a one-in-a-million series. Never watched the same theme series with this kind of main idea. A real amazing example of romance, psychological, & drama that worth to watch in a series.\\n\r\nThe soliloquy is masterpiece. What an unthinkable thoughts and ideas occur, as well as its visualization in soliloquy parts. If other series using too much soliloquy that makes it boring, Kuzu no Honkai used soliloquy to craft the development of story.\\n\r\nWhat a fucking moment when they spite mockery, ridicule, nonsense thoughts. The usage of satire.\\n\r\nLove all of the elements in this psychological-romance-drama series, the characters are being self-righteous, superficial, inferior & superior. They feel so many emotions from the present, haunted future and treasured memories; emptiness, pure love, blind love, tainted wishes, guilty feelings, bitter reality, lust, malice, corrupted soul, fake happiness, as well as the representation of worst happiness.\\n\r\nFrom sound aspect, theme songs & seiyuu(s) are damn great.",

It\u2019s not just a naive \u201cI love the teacher\u201d romance, but something far more interesting. Hanabi has a crush on her childhood friend who is now her homeroom teacher. But, he only sees her as the little girl whom he took care of like a sister. Mugi fell in love with his former tutor, currently a music teacher. However, she pretends to not notice his stares and glances. Brought together by their mutual loneliness, Hanabi and Mugi are justusing each other as substitutes for their true feelings. It sounds like awful relationship, but for them it\u2019s much better than being alone.\\n\\n\r\nIf that sounds depressing, that\u2019s not all there is to it. They aren\u2019t lucky enough to live out their faux romance in peace. In their minds, they constantly agonize over their feelings and question if this is what they really want. Then at every turn, someone else wants to take over their already warped and distorted love lives. The people around them seem single-mindedly tunnel-visioned on their own ideal of love - willing to hurt others and sadly even themselves to get what they believe would make them happy.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a story filled to the brim with the dirty and smutty side of love. Unrequited love. Forbidden love. Love as a form of abusable power over others. It\u2019s safe to say this isn't a show for the average anime viewer. Instead of a normal plot of building up drama and suspense to get a payoff of warm, happy feelings at the end. We have a love story that repeatedly makes you feel worse - to the point that you as the viewer might feel abused. Characters do awful things that are meant to make you feel a mix of disgust and pity. Drama in the story develops like a slow throbbing pain with twists and turns stemming from selfishness and lust. You constantly fear everything will keep getting worse. To use the blanket term \"love story\" would be a bit disingenuous.\\n\\n\r\nBut for that reason, I believe Kuzu no Honkai is something special. If I didn\u2019t scare you away by telling you what the story is about, then you\u2019re in for a gorgeous anime. Everything from beautiful animation to distinctively crisp voice acting to scene directing makes it a great example of anime done right. The artistic style and character design were great but the sound editing and voice acting absolutely stood out of the most. What feels like half the show is done in internal thoughts and monologues, which really allows for the voice acting to shine. The characters seem like they are speaking directly into your ears. Directing for the animation is done with a clearly artistic direction to carry the concept as far as possible. Psychological and emotional scenarios are brought to life with gorgeous art and visual effects. Intimate scenes are crafted so well that you can\u2019t help but feel a bit awkward for prying into someone else\u2019s life.\\n\\n\r\nI really can\u2019t stop praising how well this anime handled such an ugly topic. For what it sets out to do, Kuzu no Honkai does an amazing job. It almost too ambitiously tackles all the ugly parts of romance. And it doesn\u2019t baby us with the naive approach of telling us how to deal with all of these problems - there\u2019s no pretending that they have the answers and no goal to make us feel good. As a viewer, don't take this show at face value - especially in real life, there isn't always a clear resolution. Love can make you feel terrible, but it\u2019s ultimately just part of regular human life.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone who wants to watch an anime that breaks the traditional romance mold in order to reach something more genuine, watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note, even though the characters weren\u2019t designed to be adored, I think Hanabi is just too precious for this world.",

            "content": "6.5/10. A masterpiece of a first half let down by an absolutely atrocious final third. [REVIEW CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS]\r\nI'll get why I loved the show in the first part out of the way. Kuzu no Honkai is to the teenage romance triangle genre what School Days was to the harem genre. While most other shows take a real life scenario to its most fantastical extreme, Kuzu no Honkai goes the complete opposite direction and takes it to its most logical extreme. I feel that my enjoyment of it is more due to the sad state of the industry rather than anything it did exceptionally well.It's main drawing point is that it is a rather realistic romance show, in an industry where romance is portrayed as anything but realistic.\\n\\n\r\nWhile most romance series go through its entire run without the characters ever confessing their feelings for each other, or if we are lucky, a kiss in the final episode, Kuzu no Honkai goes straight off the bat in the first episode to the characters making out with each other. In that sense, the potential for development in this series is already in an entire league than the conventional romance anime. Not to mention that saying that the show is a love triangle is a complete understatement. In fact, it is more of a love octogon. Everybody is in some sort of twisted relationship with a multitude of other characters. Of course, there are far worst scenarios in hentai, but in that case I view the characters as just fap material for someone\u2019s weird fetish. In this case, I approach anime seriously and view these characters as very real human beings with real personalities. Unless you are the type that is unable to separate porn from other forms of visual entertainment, it is impossible not to feel for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI felt the a sense of unbearable nausea when watching the show, something akin to the feeling I had when watching Aku no Hana or Shinsekai Yori. It is so much till the extent that when I watch the sex scenes, I don\u2019t feel turned on, but rather I am on the verge of crying and screaming at the screen for the characters to please just fucking stop. It was so emotionally exhausting to watch. I had originally intended to marathon the whole series in one or two days, but it was simply too depressing and painful that I couldn\u2019t watch more than one or two episodes in a day without needing to take a break to recover some of my emotional sanity. I spend hours upon hours after each episode ended thinking of each of the character\u2019s emotional state and motivations. The show succeeded brilliantly in this regard. Coupled with the phenomenal OP and ED, I truly felt that Kuzu no Honkai had the potential to be one of the most revolutionary genre-defining shows of the decade.\\n\\n\r\nI have to question how much of \u201ctrue love\u201d Hanabi\u2019s feelings for Kanai, and Mugi\u2019s feelings for Akane were. To the show\u2019s credit, they never force a definite viewpoint on the audience, and mainly just show the relationships through Hanabi\u2019s and Mugi\u2019s perception, leaving the viewers to make up their own minds about it.\\n\\n\r\nSince Hanabi has known Kanai from way back in her childhood, even before she had any sexual awareness, it is much easier to view her feelings as genuine. Yet, there is the sense that Kanai is just her idealization of the absent father figure in her life, which is poignant irony given that the entire reason why Kanai chooses Akane over Hanabi in the end is arguably because of his Oedipus complex (more on that later). Also, as much as I try to put myself in her shoes, there is no way that closing her eyes while making out with Mugi and imagining that Mugi is Kanai is an accurate reflection of \u201ctrue love\u201d. That is the very epitome of sexual desire. It would be interesting to have an analysis from a female viewer\u2019s point of view about it.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, I\u2019m a male, so I should be sympathetic of the male characters and spiteful of the female characters, but in fact I find it the other way around. While I can see why a lot of people would hate Akane, honestly it\u2019s not as if she forced anybody to have sex with her at gunpoint. Everybody willingly fucked with her completely of their own accord and their own sexual desire. You could say that she \u201cused\u201d them, but everybody knew they were being used and still chose to go along with it.\\n\\n\r\nI can give the females some benefit of the doubt, but I'm a guy and I know when Mugi is completely talking out of his ass. Bottom line is, he puts his sexual desire first and foremost. Which is nothing wrong, and you can put on a facade for the other characters as much as you want, but it's utterly disgusting how he even lies to himself in his internal monologues. At least Hanabi openly admits that she cannot tell the difference between love and lust anymore. Akane, while easily being the most morally empty character, has never pretended from the start that she was anything more than a slut that uses men. We never have any sort of moment like this from Mugi. Regarding Mugi\u2019s feelings for Akane, I have no doubt in my mind that it was almost completely sexual attraction. Their only previous interactions are that of student and tutor, and coming from someone that has gone through a lot of tuition classes in my life, I simply do not see how any kind of meaningful interaction can comes about from that. Just look at how many times Mugi had sex with Akane before even thinking to go on a date with her. And this is his behaviour towards a person he claims he has \u201ctrue love\u201d for. How much worst would his behaviour be towards a female he views only as a sex object? To see Mugi trying to explain away his sexual desires for Akane to himself as some kind of true love is particularly revolting, and it really makes me question how much of his internal psyche is reliable as a narrator. If he lies to himself about Akane, then how can the audience trust his internal monologues regarding Hanabi or Moka?\\n\\n\r\nI genuinely felt that Hanabi, while being addicted to sexual pleasure and massively confused regarding the boundaries between love and lust, was undeniably yearning for something more in her relationship with Mugi. Mugi on the other hand, had a dick in place of brains. He\u2019s not content with just fucking Hanabi, also goes out of his way to call his childhood friend to fuck and takes advantage of Moka\u2019s infatuation with him to make out with her. Again, sexual desire is a perfectly normal thing for a human being, but what repulses me is Mugi\u2019s complete pretentiousness about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe series arguably reached its high point midway through when Hanabi effectively becomes no different from Akane, trying to possess everyone who desires Akane. That is a very interesting direction I would loved the show to have taken. That everyone has the potential to become complete scum if pushed far enough. It would have been beautiful; a girl who has her \u201ctrue love\u201d taken away by a conniving slut incapable of love, eventually transforms into the very being which she hates, becoming yet another conniving slut incapable of love, and the whole cycle repeats once again.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the last third is when all previously established characterization flies out of the window. There was a huge tonal shift from that moment onwards and the whole show went downhill till the point that I couldn\u2019t even believe it was the same series I was watching before.\\n\\n\r\nThere was the extremely odd decision to suddenly ditch Hanabi as the main character and put the focus on Akane. If the ultimate aim of the series was to showcase some kind of transformation from the previously unredeemable Akane, then make her the main character in the first place! Maybe then they could have crafted enough justification for the viewers to swallow her so-called \u201ctransformation\u201d. Why do you spend 8 whole episodes developing Hanabi and Mugi\u2019s relationship only to shaft it to the side and focus on something else for the remaining 4 episodes?\\n\\n\r\nSo Akane, who has spent her whole life sleeping with countless men and using them for her own amusement, suddenly falls in love with Kanai because he does not mind being cucked? WTF? I think this could have been a really poignant development if only they took the time to really develop it, say gradually over the course of the entire series. Instead, we get a whole lifetime of characterisation undone in the space of a single episode. Hey, the power of love trumps all yeah? Completely out of left field.\\n\\n\r\nKanai is one of the biggest cucks I've ever seen in any medium. So he is fine with marrying Akane despite her, in her exact own words, being a slut and fine with her sleeping with other men despite their relationship? This works if he is in it just for the sex, but since the show chooses not to portray his motivations that way, then what is it? The show tries to portray his love as some kind of \u201cselfless unconditional love\u201d, but is it really like that? If he was even in love with her personality in the first place, then why would he still be in love with her given that her fa\u00e7ade has been exposed to be nothing but a fraud? And if he\u2019s not in it for the sexual aspect, what is he in it for? Why does he love Akane? The answer is then obviously because she is nothing but an idealization in his eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings about the disturbing implication is that Kanai is in love with Akane solely because she resembles his dead mother. Being \u201cin love\u201d for the sole sake of sexual gratification is tragic and all, but because of his Oedipus complex? Fucking hell. The fact that their relationship was the only one that, at least of a surface level, worked out in the end out of the many others that failed in the series is particularly horrific. Out of all the relationships in the show, this is ultimately the most hollow and superficial one. If the show could spend a ridiculous amount of screentime on the shallow Mugi, who\u2019s entire psyche can be summed up in three words \u201cI was horny\u201d, then why does it neglect the most important motivation begging to be explored; that of Kanai and his Oedipus complex? I think instead of casting their relationship as \u201cthe power of true love\u201d, it would be much more effective if the series had explored this particular disturbing aspect, that ultimately the only successful relationship in the whole show is the biggest sham of all.\\n\\n\r\nHanabi\u2019s \u201cdevelopment\u201d from sleeping around unable to control her sexual urges to suddenly deciding to wait for true love is again completely out of left field. If anything, I thought her rejection by Kanai, coupled together with Mugi sleeping together with Akane, would completely drive her off the deep end. She was already sleeping around with multiple people, why does she decide to stop all of a sudden? There is no logical explanation for this. So when the possibility of a relationship with Kanai still exists, she sleeps around with Mugi, with her lesbian friend, with some random guy she bumps into at the train station, but the moment Kanai has concretely rejected her, she stops doing so anymore? Why? The entire point of her sexual relationships in the first place was to try and fill a void that was left in her by Kanai. The void is still there. For a character that was crying and one step away from a complete emotional breakdown every single episode at the start, it is unnatural how she reverts back to relative normalcy in the closing episodes for no particular reason at all. Character\u2019s emotional states aren\u2019t something for the writers to conveniently use and change at the flick of a switch if the plot so happens to call for it. Emotional hurt is something long lasting and if there is a change in the psyche of a character, there better damn well be a good explanation for it, something this show completely fails to provide.\\n\\n\r\nEcchan\u2019s willingness to let go of Hanabi was a complete farce too. So when Hanabi was still in a relationship with Mugi, and still had the possibility of being accepted by Kanai, Ecchan had no problem with having sex with her (even touching her while in the school library for fuck\u2019s sake) and openly telling Mugi\u2019s about Hanabi\u2019s infidelity in a fit of possessiveness. But now that Hanabi has been rejected by Kanai, and is no longer seeing Mugi, Ecchan suddenly decides that she is not going to have sexual relations with Hanabi anymore? Utterly ridiculous. If anything, Ecchan\u2019s relationship with Hanabi was easily the most toxic and possessive of all, so for her to give it up with absolutely zero justification is all the more confusing.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing that the show to warrant the characters to make such changes. The show has the audacity to attempt to fool the viewers that these characters had developed in some way, namely that they were able to overcome their sexual desires in the pursuit of true love. Rubbish. In the final episode, if Mugi had tried to kiss Hanabi, or vice versa, or if Ecchan had tried to kiss Hanabi, or vice versa, it would have delved into a full blown make-out session, as has been the case throughout the entire series. It\u2019s fine not to have development over the course of a series, real life is like that, people don\u2019t change sometimes. But what I hate the most the forced fake development that is thrown in for the sake of it just because it is the finale.\\n\\n\r\nThe writers use multiple time skips covering entire months within the space of the final episode in an attempt to sell this \u201cdevelopment\u201d but it comes across as entirely artificial and contrived. Most series use time skips very carefully and at most once or twice during the entire course of the show. To have it multiple times in just one episode reeks of lazy writing, where they realize that they cannot possibly organically justify the characters\u2019 transformations, and thus just fast forward the show in a farcical attempt at development.\\n\\n\r\nAnother criticism I have for the series is that the writers takes the easy way out; rather than show that all characters are equally detestable, they very conveniently use the sociopathic Akane in order to get the viewers to feel some kind of sympathy to Hanabi and Mugi. Objectively, Hanabi and Mugi are both characters that are rotten to the core, but the writers try to paint them as some kind of sympathetic heroine/hero because there's a character with an even more deplorable moral compass. Akane becomes a scapegoat the viewers can blame all the emotional turmoil the other characters are experiencing on.\\n\\n\r\nThis is especially the case in how the show tries to portray Hanabi as some sort of victimised tragic character. She willingly sleeps with multiple people, but hey, she's still \"pure\" because she never went all the way with them. Oh come on. She\u2019s as filthy as all the other characters in the show. It is true that Ecchan\u2019s desire for Hanabi was bordering on forceful and rapey, but if Hanabi truly did not want to have sexual relations with her, she could simply have walked away. She gave in to her lust all the same despite feeling it was wrong. Frankly, there\u2019s nothing that the characters in the show does that I, or the majority of human being in their position would not do, but that\u2019s the whole point. Humans will hurt others and trample over others in order to fulfil their own selfish desires. Yes, Hanabi is indeed the victim, but at the same time she is also the aggressor, she also manipulates and toys with others, and it is important to keep that in mind while feeling sorry for her.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the series is terrible in the sense that internal monologues plague every single episode. Have the writers ever heard of \"show, not tell\"? The writers\u2019 idea of characterization is literally having whole minutes on characters babbling on inside their heads. It\u2019s flogging a dead horse. Why even bother to have proper characterization when you can just have some psycho-babble, right? And it\u2019s not like the show is trying to tell its viewers: \"hey, look at these pretentious fucks trying to rationalize their desire for sexual pleasure as something deeper\", the show tries to pass of these internal monologues are something legit. It\u2019s almost like the show is trying to scream: \"Look how deep I am! Look at my internal anguish and conflict!\" and beat the viewers over the head with it.\\n\\n\r\nI have seen people praising the ending as realistic. Were they even watching the same show as I was? Which particular relationship is realistically resolved? They point to the fact that Hanabi and Mugi don\u2019t end up together as some kind of proof that the show had such a \u201cdeep\u201d \u201cbittersweet\u201d ending. People praising the ending claim that they avoided the typical happy ending of romance anime. But if you ask me, the ending completely at odds with the tone and characterisation and themes brought up over the course of the series. Yes, it\u2019s a bittersweet ending if you compare with the endings of most other series, but comparing the series with itself, with the tone and emotional turmoil set in the first half, the ending is an unnaturally optimistic one.\\n\\n\r\nThe people that want to see Mugi and Hanabi together don\u2019t actually mean that they love each other. Well, I won\u2019t deny that there are some people that want some lovey-dovey ending with Hanabi and Mugi finding \u201ctrue love\u201d with each other, but those kind of people have missed the entire point of the show in the first place. The show has made it clear that frankly Mugi never saw Hanabi as anything but a sex object. Vice versa, I\u2019ll give Hanabi the benefit of the doubt, but it is undeniable that the vast majority of their so-called relationship was nothing but sexual pleasure.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I mean, and what I think a lot of other people mean when they say they want an ending with Mugi and Hanabi together is both of them being in a sham relationship, using each other for sexual pleasure and deluding themselves that they have feelings for each other. Which is effectively no different from the start. And that\u2019s the whole point. An utterly depressing ending, with each of the two leads making absolutely zero progress in finding true love, and in fact being even further away from it than ever because Kanai and Akane are married. For a show whose entire premise in the first place was to take the genre of teenage romance to its logical extreme, why doesn\u2019t it choose to go all the way? Why stop short?\\n\\n\r\nThe whole show was building up to a tipping point, but when the point came, there was no spectacular collapse, it just kind of fizzled out. They spent 8 whole episodes tearing down the characters only for it to amount to nothing in the end. What exactly are the consequences for the malicious hurtful actions all of the characters have inflicted on others and have been inflicted on themselves throughout the series? Nothing much to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s entire selling point was that it is not like all the other clich\u00e9 romance dramas, only to turn that on its head in the end, which is utterly disappointing. The series, which had initially prided itself on its realism, becomes an exercise in suspension of disbelief. It wants to do a different take on the romance genre, but instead of seeing it through to its logical extreme, does a complete 360. Instead of maintaining its direction all the way to the bitter ending, Kuzu no Honkai decides to pussy out and incorporate elements of a typical clich\u00e9 romance. And we\u2019re left wondering what could have been. Nonetheless, the phenomenal set-up in the first half and it\u2019s refreshing take on the teenage romance genre makes this a must-watch. It\u2019s such a pity the show did not have the vision and ambition to follow it through to the end.",

It delves into the darkness of the human soul, what people find the most uncomfortable(unless they have a NTR fetish). \r\nThis series touches me in a very unconventional manner: It dares to challenge and explore the depths of the human soul, how ugly one can get in romance. Throughout the entire series, we see how ugly the characters are: their personality, their attitude and also the selfish desire of possessiveness. As the series get by, we slowly see how the characters mature while handling thescars they had. The art and sound weren't particularly outstanding or noteworthy except the good choice of song used for the ED. Characters developed wonderfully, pacing was not too fast nor slow. In overall, I enjoy the series a lot and feel like we need more stuff that dares to go out of its comfort zone.\\n",

            "content": "!!!!SPOILER FREE!!!! (except a part which is marked) \r\nI am a pretty big drama fan, but boy this anime was something special. I heard mixed oppinions about this in winter, but I didn't wanted too many spoilers so I didn't read any reviews, and now I will tell you my experience with Kuzu no Honkai.\r\nI will start with the good parts: Both Art and Sound were amazing. I really loved the aesthetics. Unfortunately, that's all there is good in this anime.\r\nThe plot was decent, pretty standard for a drama, the biggest problem are the characters. Even though it's a story, I can't belive they areso unnatural, baisicaly stupid and inhuman. Starting from the main characters (Hanabi and Mugi), which are beyond lame, with their childish way of thinking (I won't say to much because I don't want to spoil), to the main interst points (Akane and Narumi). I can't even express in words how I feel about these two. Firstly, Akane's attitude is anything but a respectable woman's attitude which brings me to my next point, Narumi. How can this kind of guy even exist?! (Again I won't say more to not spoil)\\n\\n\r\n!!!Spoiler alert!!!\\n\\n\r\nFor those who managed to see it trough, I'm not satisfied with the ending. Personally, it could've been a much better story if the main focus was on CONFESSING then BEING REJECTED and GAINING AFFECTION FROM THE LOVED ONE rather then b******g around and getting laid; plus some yuri action.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion, I give Kuzu no Honaki a 5/10, only, JUST ONLY, for the art and sound. If you want to watch it, do it at your own risk, I almost punched through my monitor a few times.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this, and sorry for not making it more in-depth, I'm still unexperienced at writting reviews",

            "content": "Hopeless love. Painful love. Unrequited love. Are they really that beautiful?\r\nAhh, Kuzu no Honkai. After starting my anime experience with ecchi harems and then moving on to watching nothing but romantic comedies, this one was really a breath of fresh air. This is one of the realist most dramatic stories I've ever had the pleasure of watching unfold. At the times of watching this I felt anger, sadness and a deep sense of depression. This brought me very little happiness and it makes me wonder why I like it so much. Maybe it's just a sense of relation that I can feel towards the characters?\\n\\n\r\nStory - The story really is something else. I've never seen anything like it. I'm sure there are ones like it but most of the time the art style is a major turn off for me. The story follows the two main characters who are in the same situation, they love someone they cannot have. They mutually use each other, but not for the right reason. Instead of dating to get over the one they love, they engage in physical intimacy while only amplifying the feelings they have for those people. Actions happen, mistakes are made, and the consequences of their decisions are made quite apparent. It's not a happy story if that's what you're looking for, Kuzu no Honkai is painfully realistic and crosses a line which many others do not dare to cross.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art was phenomenal. Great character designs, beautiful scenery, really nice transitions which replicate and complement the manga. <- Never thought I'd say that before, this anime was the first ever to make me actually want to read the manga.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound - Not much for me to say here. Good OP, good ED, and good BGM. All of which greatly complement the show.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - As for sound, not much for me to say here either. The characters are complete trash. They really put the \"Scum\" in \"Scum's Wish,\" if that wasn't already obvious enough. Watching these idiots do the things they did only pissed me off and left me with no hope for a happy ending. Mugi and Akane are just complete and utter shit. Moca was okay for the most part. Hanabi was pretty much the only good character until Sanae corrupted her and pushed her into darkness. They all suck and that's just another reason why this anime is so good.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - As much as this anime hurt me I have to say I did truly enjoy it. That may just be my masochistic tendencies or just the need for something other than the basket full of generic shounen romcoms, I'll never know for sure. But this one really clicked with me and I don't regret it.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall - As a whole I rate Kuzu no Honkai a solid 10/10. It may not be the prettiest or the happiest anime out there, but that's just another reason I love it so much.",

            "content": "\"SPOILER WARNING\" \r\nKuzu no Honkai introduces itself as a rebellious new style of storytelling,       going against the norm of society and giving an insight into the \"unspoken\" parts of relationships, which many will often keep to themselves or behind closed doors. It is this in-depth portrayal of the lewd and scandalous that gains the show traction and has it being discussed constantly.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe plot and its decision to focus in on the more physical aspects of the relationship is a double-edged sword. This risqu\u00e9ness and the uncomfortable atmosphere it creates is the basis of why the show has receivedso much traction.  The energy that the show gained from its racy scenes carried the anime in its earlier episodes. The downside of this is that the show relied far too heavily on the physical, and its effect wore off by episode 4-5. This is partially why some of the relationships seemed to lack any emotional foundations as the show focused in on more of the physical aspects. (by these relationships I am referencing to those involving Sanae and Noriko) When their relationships wore down and broke apart, the show neglected to highlight the emotional turmoil and after effects which followed, almost as if the story didn't affect the main characters as a person and how they thought or viewed the world.\\n\r\nAn exception to this where the show focused in on the emotional consequences very well was with Akane and Narumi in the last few episodes, where the relationship developed who they were, and also showed how the relationship was changing them mentally as a person.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nBy \"art\"  I will also focus in on cinematography and visual effects. The art style and colour grade share resemblances to a palette of watercolors, which was a smart decision. The saturated and pale colours suit the somber and often depressing mood of the show well. The \"comic strip\" style of transitioning was also a nice touch, adding some energy in between the shots and an effective way of showing flashbacks and memories to the audience.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening \"Uso no Hibana\" by 96neko was a good song choice. Personally, it didn't fit the mood of the show as effectively as the ending, however it mare no noticeable difference to the enjoyment of the show. The ending song, \"Heikousen\" by Sayuri was an amazing pick and honestly my favourite ending of this season, the atmosphere it created couldn't have fit the show any better, and the slow transition into the ending song was really effective at emphasizing the last few words said in each episode and carrying along the message. The soundtrack, composed by Masaru Yokoyama, who also composed great pieces for other anime such as Your Lie in April, created a smooth-flowing score which suited the atmosphere and specific shots well. Although no specific piece stands out above the others, the score is still well-rounded and delivers where necessary.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10 \\n\r\nOverall most of the character don't fit into any stereotype or abide by the standard anime tropes, they are all interesting individuals to a certain extent nad all undergo reasonable development, thanks to monologuing and backstories. Hanabi's original portrayal as sweet and innocent is turned on its head after her relationship with Mugi, as she doesn't know how to react or feel anymore. The scenes of Hanabi debating with herself, although few in number, gave a good insight into her inner thoughts, especially when dealing with Narumi, and gave a fresh contrast to the typical monologue. One thing, however, which the anime failed in doing was getting the viewer attached to the characters, especially when it came to the characters of Noriko nad Sanae, who received little development, and so their relationships had little effect on the main characters. The ending of the relationship between Mugi and Akane also lacked any emotional backing, largely due to the lack of development we received for Mugi.\\n\r\nThe character of Noriko tended to annoy me at times, who often bordered on the tsundere loli trope, and was generally underdeveloped and had little driving force behind her feelings other than childhood fantasies.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI'm a cynical cold bastard who's favourite animes include most tragic romances, and who's preferred genres are anything that will bring me remotely close to feeling. It was unlikely that I would not enjoy the show. Although this does mean that my review would likely be slightly biased, I atempted to keep it rounded as much as possible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kuzu no Honkai did not fail to impress with its drastic contrast to the typical outlook on most relationships found in anime, and regardless of you preferred genre or type of show, this anime offers a unique view into character development, relationships, and the romance genre as a whole, which I believe everyone should experience .\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This ranges from the struggles of unrequited love, difference between love and lust, and how great and meaningful love is. \r\nSTORY:\r\nI love that the story is very unique. It juggles around the relationships of multiple characters, and does it well. Its doesn\u2019t make me think \u201domg just get back to Mugi\u2019s and Hana\u2019s relationship already!!(my main ship)\u201d Instead it makes me wonder what will happen between Hana and Sanae, Mugi and Akane etc.  It\u2019s actually very realistic, what are the chances of the person you love reciprocating it out of all the people inthe world? Especially when that love is not politically correct, a student and a teacher. The intimate scenes are executed well. You really can how that person is feeling, whether it is lust or pain. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nAll of the characters are original and unique. They all develop in terms of getting over someone or learning how to love. You really get attached to some of them and their relationships.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art was GORGEOUS. Animation was great too! :)\\n\r\nI could have gone without the saliva strings lol but it didn\u2019t affect my enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nGood voice acting. Outstanding music, the OP and ED songs were great!\\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\\n\r\nThis show is outstanding. Unrequited love is painful and this show definitely reflects that. You become invested in the characters and really start to root for their relationships. Overall it is a very good watch that I recommend for mature audiences (obviously, bc it's R+). The show is 9/10 for me!\\n\\n",

Just like going out of your home into a blizzard, stunned in wonder and beauty, or in shivers and frost, or if you are me: in both. I take that the author followed his own instincts, this is what makes this piece veryconfronting, and I especially like that about it. You will understand better why I say all of this when you read my review as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\nThis story is just so full of surprises. In every episode we discover something new, and in a very, very dramatic way. The way ideas are presented to us is simply bold and strongly linked to each characters deeper inner voice. The story builds on in the few first episodes with a suspenseful tranquility, to then make its rise into emotion with even more ferocity by having huge contrasts between episodes which all have their own turn and feel. The episodes seem to appear in a fashion of mini movies in the way that they come out as being very clear in their development within the story and in how much mind-challenge each one holds. I was personally really moved by the ideas that were suggested in Kuzu no Honkai, not only because of how novel they were to me, but especially because of the way in which they struck me.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is simply bliss. Each scenery just flows into the other without any struggle whatsoever. You just get trapped into the story. I really like it when this anime sometimes looms manga-like images into the video, it makes it even more authentic and inclines me to be more involved with such an art piece. The artwork on characters is just magnificent, it's an art so beautiful and yet very distinct to itself. I'm really into a manga/anime when the art is beautiful. I suppose it makes me feel like the thing is more real because my feelings cling easier to the beauty of characters, and in turn more importantly to their personality which may then make my experience even more emotionally tangible. What I especially liked was how the art worked subtly with sounds by combining with purpose, like a triggering tempo.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nIt speaks to me a whole lot on this level. The music and sound in this anime is incredible. I know I often introduce an idea by only giving adjectives, but the thing is I don't use words when I don't think them with real honesty and without keeping up my stance up to them. The character's voice choice is a pure delight. They represent the characters as in who they are with precision. The surrounding sounds make the experience more palpable. We can really feel how the creators choose carefully each and every sound that is being realized. The music in itself eludes so much into the art piece by allowing to flow at the right time, and by having been composed with intent. The smallest sounds really freak me out though, a finger touching wood, the kissing, the whispers, the flow of wind, the emotional tone...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nCharacters simply go beyond my own expectations. They are full of intrigue, even the one's that first appear as being really bland and dull, develop into their very own piece's of work. The way in which we are projected into their lifes ; an inception that works out emotions of your own as a release into the more concrete. I personally got caught up so tight with Noriko's impression of the world. The way in which the episode focused on her is brought into life is simply amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI can simply not express my enjoyment enough with such a short and simple review. I thought at the least, that I should give back the people who made this anime some of my gratitude. This is only the second review I have written so far on my anime list, and I won't write one unless tremendously moved.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nI guess when I think back of this anime, and of how I felt at that moment when the sound and images used to emerge in front of me, I can never really remake or rewrite the feel of my experience. It's as if I would get overwhelmed if I tried to do it. Taken into a push, mystic, every snow flake around, impossible for me to catch all at once, whether it be with my ears, eyes or hands.\\n\\n\r\nI wish to add as well that you might want to come back to read this review once you've experienced the piece on your own. In the hope that I can share my feelings.",

With a weird lore and development bunching up the whole series together like a paper ball with drugs inside. \r\nStory : 7/10\r\nAs confusingly bunched up as it is, there are so many plots and that made the anime posses my mind. Making me go crazy at times, it's like a complicated maze that is nearly impossible to exit. \r\nArt : 8/10 \r\nThe art's pretty good. The character's visual look, the background, and others looks brilliant. \r\nSound : 8/10\r\nThe opening is catchy as hell, while the ending is not-to-care-about-as-usual. The soundtracks are great, whether as abackground music or in scenes. The flaw is the fact that sometimes it sounds more like a background music in series scenes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 7/10 \\n\r\nOh, the character development of the main character was so good. She got better overtime not until THAT happened. The other characters also have good development, for an example Ecchan. However, the male main character does not receive enough character development as much as the female's. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8/10 I would've given this anime a low rating if I do not enjoy mixed emotions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8/10, an anime that messes with your mind. It's worth watching it to consume your time and have some fun complaining, crying, or feeling chill and happy.",

One of the teachers, Narumi is in love with the other teacher Akane, but Akane is not actually in love with him back and just toys with him. This then causes Mugi and Hanabi to \u2018date\u2019 in order to act as a substitute for the other.\r\nStory: Complicated, painful, sad and twisted af, yet it is refreshing and unique. At times you yearn for something, another you feel like burning a character... this show plays with your emotions.\r\nArt: The eyes are drawn soprettily, and the character design is nice (apart from Takuya looking kinda similar to Mugi at first glance)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is what I enjoy the most about this anime. It is absolutely fantastic, and makes you feel the mood. The opening, ending and OST are beautiful. They are full of emotions. I don't really like Noriko's voice, but it matches her character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: All the characters are despicable in one way, and can all be considered as scum. But that is what this show circles around. Mugi is a dog, Hana is a wannabe etc.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This show is frustrating, infuriating, and twisted, yet it makes you want to keep pressing the next episode button for more. Hey, I even got impatient enough to read the manga :P You just can't take your eyes off Kuzu no Honkai. The music is great. The art is beautiful. The characters are deep. The story is... an enigma ;)",

What stands out for someone who's watched several hundreds of anime series is the way the story is presented. It is done very tastefully and quite beautifully if you pay attention to the artwork's equivalent to \"dramatic pause\". We've seen this used in several other animes where there is a cut in the animation and words are on the screen in kanji to emphasize emotion. This is done as well as breaks using frames. The ending song is in my opinion a greatsoundbit and with the kaleidoscope visuals makes it perfect. I only put enjoyment as a 9 because many people might not be able to enjoy this kind of drama where things don't go the way you would like it. Lots of emotional pain in this one.",

Their feelings. Their desires.\\n\r\nIt's not one-sided at all.\\n\r\nThey do a great (TOO GREAT) job at building up the tragedy & making you more & more frustrated, while addicted at the same time.\\n\r\nVery unique way of telling a tragic love story. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[ART]: 6.7\\n\r\nIt's not bad.\\n\r\nIt's not fantastic.\\n\r\nI wouldn't call it great either, so I gave it an odd score.\\n\r\nI would consider great, like Kaberni.\\n\r\n(Although a lot of people have mixed feelings on Kabaneri, there's no denying how beautifully done the anime is. It's on a movie level.)\\n\r\nI think it's on the same animation lvl as Ao Haru Ride. \\n\r\nIt has its quirks, but it's still your basic level animation.\\n\r\nIt's the kind of animation that anime get when the studios don't expect it to be THAT big.\\n\r\nJust one step above those anime where they animate body movement as little as possible. Those anime (not this one) are the ones that are mainly for Otome or game fans, not so much others.\\n\\n\r\nTHE OPENING and ENDING... are SO interesting. \\n\r\nIt's so weird! It's based off of ink blots & basically forms vaginas lmao\\n\r\nThe first time you watch it makes you really mesmerized xD\\n\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND]: 6.5\\n\r\nIt's very fitting to the situations.\\n\r\nNot bad at all.\\n\r\nIt's fine, but I'm not about to give it a higher score if it's not fantastic lol\\n\\n\\n\r\n[CHAR]: ??\\n\r\nI have no idea how to rate the characters lmfao \\n\r\nI don't hate them, but I don't like them like that?? Not fond of anyone.\\n\r\nI just feel sorry for them all xD\\n\r\nThey're all living tragic lives in their own way.\\n\r\nNo matter how bitchy a character might be, the way they have to live with their unrequited love or the way that they are is just tragic lol \\n\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]: 9 \\n\r\nYou know what I'm gonna give it a 9 because this is a really unique anime & I'm SICK of what modern anime has turned into.\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: 8\\n\r\nModern anime, for the most part, is just copycat trash. And I'm not saying that as an OG Anime fan either.\\n\r\nIt's the literal truth.\\n\r\nI can't think of a single anime rn that loves to add on this much love tragedy in such a tasteful way as this one does lol\\n\r\nIt's not smut, but I wouldn't openly watch this with my parents around.\\n\r\nIt's a mid-way point between smut & normal anime.\\n\r\nSmormal lol \\n\r\nBUT YEAH.\\n\r\nENJOYING IT SO FAR (still watching as I write this review).\\n\r\nWOULD PROBS LOVE THE MANGA.\\n\r\n10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND GIVING IT A TRY. \\n\r\nWatch 2 EPs before you think about whether or not to continue. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "[Light spoilers ahead as of EP 7]\r\nKuzu no Honkai is a very mature (basicaly soft-core porn) romance anime set in high school (duh!). In very first episodes you can notice that this is not your average slice of life rom-com with very light and mostly only hinted actual romance.\r\nFirst impression that this show made on me was quite good, good enough to write my original 9 out of 10 review where I praised finally handling romance rom-com differently. It isn't most genious story out there, simply two high-schoolers having kinda weird crushes so they decided to be each other's substitutes. The way how together withfantastic art and music portlayed it was unique at least. The cast doesn't act as 12 year olds blushing and getting embarrased. Well, actually there is not a lot of anime having so much of intimacy as this.\\n\\n\r\nBut is this alone enough for a good anime ? Nope.\\n\\n\r\nAfter first episodes made you feel very excited about all the possibilities this anime could go, as each new episode, I got more bored and dissapointed. When I initially praised anime for it's way of handling romance, I don't know that this will be only thing handled here and how poorly when inital suprise of \"wow they actually kissing\" wear off.\\n\\n\r\nI mean seriously, you won't find anything else here. 100% of runtime consist of static characters just talking or thinking about who to f*ck, if they are not doing so. Super-clever looking monologue doesn't help making story deeper than this.\\n\\n\r\nIt also won't help that initial pretty innocent premmise of woman MC \"I like A but I can't be with A so I will seek banging in B\" became in the middle \"...So I will date B but I will meanwhile I go to bed with C because why not (yuri FTW!) and will try to f*ck D and make him fall for me and meanwhile A and B...\"\\n\\n\r\nIt's simply a nonsense. It's so artificial, so unnatural that you quickly stop care about them. Because they simply can not exist in our world. I can more identify with those generic rom-com situations that I was making fun of in my first review. Characters are simply the worst. Almost every one of them. Not just one antagonist, they all just morons thinking only screwing everybody around (literally and also metaphorically). No fun, no develompent, any plot that would hold up that romance. That's also the reason why I don't have much to talk about besides this.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end, I must give credits for trying something different, for very good first episodes and for unique art and sound. That's it. As a manga reader, I know that this will go even futher downhill. So if you like this premise and you are masochist, then this is for you, otherwise you are going for mediocre ride at best that won't give you anything that other soft core and hentai can't.",

I enjoyed it a lot, but it is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea. \r\nCharacters (10)\r\nWe tend to present ourselves in ways that make us look more socially acceptable than we are. Kuzu no Honkai is a good reflection of this. The characters look like ordinary, mild mannered individuals, and yet, they think ugly thoughts and behave in scummy ways. This might sound off-putting to some people, but it\u2019s both realistic and fascinating. Although they look like typical anime tropes (the aloof dark-haired girl, the generic bishounen), the characters are all startlingly human.  \r\nArt (10)\r\nThe artis beautiful, with clean lines and nice colours. What makes it really stand out is the symbolism hidden inside. For example, the inkblots in the ED depict sexual imagery in a surreal, artsy way, similar to what you would see in a Rorschach test. You can see Hanabe\u2019s side profile emerge from a splotch that looks suspiciously like a bright pink vagina, which is pretty... interesting. Everything is left open to interpretation, and these kinds of touches help add a whole new dimension of madness and perversion to the show. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7)\\n\r\nThe voice acting was good. OP and ED are both decent as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9)\\n\r\nHell, I liked it so much that I went ahead and finished the manga.

I can tell you dont expect some deep things when they have problems to deal with. They will literally just find a person which they can fuck. No joke this serie could be a hentai. You love somenone but he doesnt love you? Fuck your friend. You are afraid about your future? Fuck your goddamn teacher. You are afraid of spiders? Fuck another friend. This is like every solution the characters will find. Youhave the chance to see 6 people fucking each other because of stupid problems. You think you should fight for your love? Hahaha dont be stupid you have a friend next to you just fuck him. The story is very bad too like the characters. You could expect that there will be a point in this anime where they will tell there Feelings for each other but then the mangaka find some really legits ways how they handle it. For example you see how a character makes a decicion in his mind that he will take a girl because he loves her. Than they will be a dark screen and the next thing you will se is how the same guy fucks another girl. And I can tell you if you like any character oder find his decicions understandable than something is really wrong with you. So for which kind of people is this series? For the people who want to watch hentai but are too afraid to watch some",

            "content": "I want to preference that i have not completed this anime yet\r\nBut from what i seen I can tell this im going to love this regardless. \r\nAlso my first review\r\nStory \r\nIn my eyes this story hits close to home in the sense of unrequited love and wanting someone to be there for you. The story centers around Hanabi and Mugi and to cut it short their desire to get rid of sexual frustrations. It sounds very hentai like but the main idea is hey we cant have these people in our lives lets fuck. Hanabi at first seems to be a typical high school girlin love and naive to the world expect when it come to her \"brother/senpai\" She is fuul of joy when she sees him but is devastated to see him fond over a another teacher who Mugi just so happens to like. SO in short they make a promise you can have everything besides my heart and as the story goes on things change.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nCant say much im not really into art but is does look extremely pretty.\\n\r\nAlso they have some transitions where the anime does manga live panels and also this cool water pallet thing with subtitles of characters inner monologue. Found this unique haven't seen this in a anime   \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nHas great music for the mood of the show\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nNow this is where the show shines in my eyes the characters are truly scum.\\n\r\nHanabi seems like a character who simply needs to be held because she is crazy in love over her senpai. Which is cool until she starts being possessive of mugi and fools around with another character. She is also curious in bed and doesn't know what she wants and that becomes annoying while also being her charm and makes her cute in a way. Mugi on the other hand is pretty much your standard playboy at first until you get to see his character development and see he was a teen simply taken advantage of but not in a rape type way. I like this character better than hanabi cuzz he as well wanted to be loved by his crush but had his heart ripped out after finding out about the truth of his crush. while also being used and a sex toy for a girl that he seems to have feelings for.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nto be honest this show is not for teens seems like if i want bout 7 years younger(ie im 22) i would laugh at this call it hentai or a guilt pleasure. But how this story is brought up and executed seems to be a very mature anime bout unrequited love and the karma of using people for sex. P.S. do not watch this with other people its one of those shows you tell people bout but dont actually watch with them\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.5/10",

            "content": "SCUMMY. DISGUSTING. APPALLING. \r\nTurn away from this series if you have a weak heart, or stay and feast your eyes if you are brave and open, to question and view the trashy side of life.\r\nWhat can be more regrettable and despising than performing acts of love with another person that one has no feelings for; using the other party as a substitute for the one's own perverted and deep (innocent or not) desires? Make that feeling mutual and voila, you have the basic plot for Kuzu no Honkai.\r\n#STORY 9/10\r\nPlot in short (What you need to know):\r\nThe MCs Mugi and Hanabi both have unattainable and hopelessloves for the ones they love. Both lonely souls end up dating each other and doing ecchi    (\ufeff \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) acts to each other to fill that void created by their unattainable loves. Things don't get better from there, especially with more characters with their own desires and unique insecurities get thrown into the mix as the story unfolds.\\n\r\n//Note that there will be kissing and sexual(ly suggestive) scenes. (Heck, the first episode has a kiss scene in the first few minutes), if you're not comfortable with such stuff, please refrain from watching! \\n\\n\r\nWHATS GOOD ABOUT IT?\\n\r\nThis series carries very heavy, uncomfortable and mature themes with it. \\n\r\nIt's one of the few anime series that can (and will) disturb your soul.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is unique and will bring out the very dark and uncomfortable side of the lustful and selfish desires that humans have that no one wants to see. \\n\r\nThe story is crafted masterfully, such that you will likely experience conflicting feelings (mostly being turned on and disgusted. Additional feelings include being: confused, angry, empathetic, guilty, etc [add for flavouring] ). \\n\r\nCharacter development in the story is done well too, with each episode bringing out new contexts and motives of each character, changing the inter-character dynamics and advancing the slightly illogical narrative. (The narrative's momentum is crafted along the character's feelings which to me made the narrative/expository it was trying to portray slightly odd and illogical)\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing to me about the story is that it will open your eyes to an under-thought and under-looked range of topics, forcing you to think, or at the very least FEEL the pain and discomfort that the darker side of human desires can result in. If you love thinking and philosophy, this anime is really worth watching and understanding. \\n\\n\r\nReally not your typical romance anime. (Not the romcom that we're all familiar with)\\n\\n\r\n#ART 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story and characters are brought to life in a manga-like style of animation, and the way the anime is drawn is oddly satisfying and warm (not your crisp moe kyoani style). I love it, and you may very well love it too.\\n\\n\r\n#SOUND 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM and SFX are masterfully applied to each scene to really bring out many scenes' emotional weight. It really helps with enhancing and adding tension, uneasiness and melancholy just to add to your already thick mix of emotions from the story itself. The OP is also 10/10 <3. The sound from the anime is good enough to compete with NagiAsu and Amanchu's BGM (both I personally think the BGM is 10/10).\\n\r\nAlso, masterful voice acting that really bring out the emotions of the characters. \\n\\n\r\n#CHARACTER 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character development in Scum's wish is quite well done. As scummy and trashy the characters can be, you can still empathize and somewhat understand their emotional pain and baggage they carry.\\n\r\nI'm not sure about you, but I oddly despise yet love (and sympathize) the characters (most of them). This conflicting feeling towards characters can be hard to come by in most anime.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the slight beef I have with Kuzu no Honkai's characters is that at times I honestly cannot get a firm grip on how the characters think BUT, their motives and actions are largely based on their various needs and insecurities (be it a severely sadistic disorder or a simple need for affection and love). //Oh my, I'm droning on at this point\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I felt quite attached to one or two of these characters although I did despise parts of them.\\n\r\nIn particular, I would really want to have a heart to heart talk with Hanabi to straighten out her insecurities. They all need counselling and therapy.\\n\\n\\n\r\n#ENJOYMENT 7/10\\n\r\nThe enjoyment you get out of this anime is not like what you get from watching Yuru Yuri or Your Name. You may not enjoy its plot and/or characters, but there is just something so intriguing and addictive to this anime that makes you come back for more (even if you feel uncomfortable or distressed). \\n\\n\\n\r\n#CONCLUSION 9/10\\n\r\nAll in all, Kuzu no Honkai (as of ep5) is a masterfully done anime that brings to light the aspects of life (mainly the feelings related to love and lust) many try to suppress and/or hide. It is really worth watching if you're up for it, as it's a really rare gem in the flood of anime that comes out nowadays. Kuzu no Honkai will challenge and go beyond your moral compass and comfort zone. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not about NTR or mindless lust. It's an anime that can incite discussion and thought when it comes to uncomfortable but important feelings and desires we have, through the beautiful and stern presentation of how the characters in Kuzu no Honkai react to such intense feelings and desires in very very bad and impulsive ways.\\n\r\nWe all can learn and empathize with the characters' pains and emotions, and learn a lot from it. \\n\\n\r\nI IMPLORE those who are mature and brave to watch this anime. It's an anime you may not love, but you won't regret it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n//This is my first review on MAL so this review could be a taaaad bit boring or awkward, but I hope my review helped you understand and get you to watch this anime!",

            "content": "This anime is basically a drama revolving around immature horny teens n adults who fail to see the true meaning of love, confusing it with their carnal feeling of lust. The author heavily tramples upon his characters twisting them into pretty much human garbage to fit the anime title and because of that you\u2019ll never sympathize or feel sorry for any character in this anime. The only sane character (if any) in this anime would be the glasses guy. Even though I can\u2019t imagine a normal person making the decision he just made, his actions just emphasize the message of this anime. Yes, as muchas how uncomfortable this anime is and how disgusting the characters turn out to be, this anime indeed has a message. That is, true unconditional platonic love, love that doesn\u2019t demand anything in return from the person you love, love that is free from lust, is the only way to save people and it can bring about a change in even the scummiest of the bitches.\\n\\n\r\nWell, compared to many other drama anime I\u2019ve watched, the enjoyment level was almost zero. I more or less watched this to find how it\u2019d turn out in the end. Even though it ended on a good note I\u2019m not completely satisfied with the ending, but I\u2019d give this an overall 6/10 just for the message. Not really recommended to everyone, but the ones who like the drama genre should definitely give it a shot.",

            "content": "The biggest satisfaction is when a show knows what it wants to be and it fully shoots for it. There are no gimmicks, no distractions, and it keeps mostly the same tone throughout. Like in real life, you don't have a hand in intensity of happenings around you, that maybe accidentally also often keeps the show fresh. That seemingly arbitrary scene intensity attempts to attain the attention high, I felt because of this that the constant atmosphere was not exhausting.\r\nKuzu no honkai is a rather eccentric show. Firstly, i recommend watching this alone, it is fairly uncomfortable to watch with others as it contain scenesthat everyone would rather keep private. This will be a completely spoilerless review. Will be rather philosophical, and i will try not to hint anything.\\n\\n\r\nI was mostly fascinated by how the show was made around the characters. From start to finish, there is tons of inner monologue that completely goes into the thinking of the characters. It is done in a way to actually not feel like dumb info dumping, but has a nice tonal switch between thoughts left for interpretation, and thoughts that could easily be taken for granted. By keeping such structure you could say it goes deep. Having this form of character introductions by having more than enough material could mean that the characters are complex and have depth.\\n\\n\r\n While in those thoughts or carefully planned words between characters, you're being shown an interesting aesthetical trick which beautifully invokes their thoughts. It revolves around showing many shots in the same moment, all appearing usually connected to what is currently being said. It adds to the dynamic and further enhances the experience. The overall visuals are splendid, they're of painting art style, graced with many colors and fits well with the overall melancholic tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSome issues could be that the characters only have \"love\" and \"sexuality\" going for them. \"Could\" because it may not be a mistake to not give on distractions and only givin to fully exploring those two themes. However, if hobbies or such were nicely incorporated, it could make the show freshen. Next, some could be frustrated on the characters and by their unrealistically daring attitudes at times. That may be justified in order to make the drama at times more intense as having a border between ficion and reailty is okay to make the fiction better if intended. Lastly sometimes the depth and monologue could come as offplace or an overkill. Realistically, people don't want sometimes to think, and would rather give in to pleasure without having a need of anything else.\\n\\n\r\nVA was on point, tried not to be similar to generic anime voice acting. Ends up fitting since the show seems to try to go for TV drama like style. music just doesn't feel offplace, I haven't noticed much about it but it didn't ruin the atmosphere of any scene as I remember. \\n\\n\r\nTalking about anything else is rather useless since its subjective. The show is rather controversial. But what sold for me was the character exploring, I always wanted a show where every thought is heard. Whilst also being given to your interpretation of what their thoughts actually mean. I didn't give this a 10 because it is forgettable. Strong scenes feel like that when you watch it, but it hasn't left me wondering weeks later.",

            "content": "Simply put, Kuzu no Honkai was one of the hardest anime to rate in my recent memory. \r\nIt's over-dramatic. Character's actions are illogical and unrealistic. The dialogue can often come across as being too deep and pretentious for its own good. Basically, it has a lot of what I hate in an anime. So why is it that it hit me so hard when I'd finished it? Why could I not stop thinking about it for the rest of the day?\r\nIt was a case of head vs heart. When I'd finished it, my head immediately told me to put it down as a 5/10, whichI objectively did. However, throughout the day, all I was thinking about was how I loved the intimate and confrontational moments where the \"Scum's Wish\" OST grew louder until that final silent drop. How I missed some of the endearing and interesting conversations between characters, despite being in a setting full of irrationality. It wasn't relatable at all and isn't a good representation of love life for the most part, but it was convincingly real enough to spark strong emotions within me.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Kuzu no Honkai did a great job of tricking me into ignoring its big faults and remembering it for its stunning execution in regards to its frequent hard-hitting moments. It's a contradiction to say this considering the flaws I've pointed out, but the show somehow just felt very human. \\n\\n\r\n***I'll go into a bit more depth (spoiler free) on how I felt about each aspect to clarify my polarizing view a little more***\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the story isn't anything special at all. I really wish that it would have focused solely on the struggles of the two main characters Hanabi and Mugi, but instead we get a growing chain where others are dragged into the heart-break abyss. Very little growth can be seen in Hanabi and Mugi as the story progresses, but this is because they already seem somewhat headstrong from the start and completely aware of not only their own emotions, but others as well. Most of the growth comes from the side characters who are sucked into the situation, which feels a little misplaced. A lot of the story revolves around Hanabi and Mugi's quest for an individual to comfort them, and to prolong the closure they require to move on from the person that they truly love. In actual fact, there isn't much of a story at all -  Kuzu no Honkai relies more on the dialogue between characters.\\n\\n\r\nART: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is simple but effective. I don't have much to comment on it except that it's pleasing on the eye and portrays the emotion of the characters well. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was the real shining light of Kuzu no Honkai for me. A sign of a great soundtrack is when you hear it and instantly remember the scenarios it was paired with and how impactful they were because of it. In general, all of the music was good, but there is a particular song in it which I believe in English just translates to \"Scum's Wish.\" The sorrow and suspense in that song is what made a lot of the scenes in the anime feel real and believable to me, blinding me to the flaws I hate within it. Of course that isn't an objective view, but enjoyment is driven largely by emotion after all. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI really like Hanabi and Mugi so this aspect would be higher if not for the fact that I felt nothing for any of the other characters. There is a certain charisma with both of them that made it enjoyable to watch their interactions. I love how perceptive they are of other people, and how there's no beating around the bush when it comes to knowing how they feel. I love the brief moments of humour in them even though they're both in depressive states. I love how they don't awkwardly fumble around each other and their dialogue feels meaningful most of the time. I said it before and I'll say it again, it felt convincingly human, even though they're surrounded by illogical and unrealistic plot-lines and actions.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT & OVERALL: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a stretch to say that Hanabi and Mugi, along with the music, completely carried this anime for me. I think the potential in it was big, there was just too many other let downs. Although, these factors were still enough to make me really enjoy it and give it an overall of 7. Admittedly, it would be hard to recommend this to people, as it is so dependent on being able to extract enjoyment from areas that you really love to compensate for its issues. But there is no harm in giving it a go.",

            "content": "Love is a difficult topic, one where there is often no right answer amidst a whirlpool of emotions. Kuzu no Honkai is a cautionary tale about unrequited love and the lengths that some will go to make themselves feel \"whole\".  It is often difficult to quantify WHY you feel a certain way and even harder to justify the actions you take. The characters of Kuzu no Honkai perfectly exemplify the listlessness lack of direction that comes with depression. Kuzu no Honkai is certainly not a perfect anime, and it is incredibly hard to watch, even more so if you are able to relate tothe characters, yet that discomfort is precisely what makes Kuzu no Honkai special. The melodrama, while not realistic, spoke to me, evoking memories of worthlessness and unfulfilled wishes. I didn't enjoy a single moment of Kuzu no Honkai, yet I found myself unable to stop watching, pining for more after the final episode ended. KnH strives to make you feel absolutely horrible in the same way as the characters feel and is that regard, I feel KnH is truly exceptional. Kuzu no Honkai is certainly not for everyone, and I strongly advise against watching if you have depressive tendencies.\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10):\\n\r\nNothing terribly exceptional aside from the intent to wear down the viewer with depressing event after depressing event. Contains several contrivances that somewhat detract from the experience. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (10/10):\\n\r\nI'm not quite sure how to put it, but the art is gorgeous to me. In particular, the emotion that is conveyed through character's eyes is so incredibly powerful, most notable in Hanabi's eyes fluctuating between hope, sorrow, and melancholy. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10):\\n\r\nThe OST is fabulous, Masaru Yokoyama is exceptionally talented at conveying emotion through music, most notably in his work on Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso. Kuzu no Honkai is no different, and though occasionally repetitive, the soundtrack compliments the anime exceptionally. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10): \\n\r\nI feel this is where Kuzu no Honkai receives the most criticism, and rightfully so. The characters act irrationally and without communicating precisely because they ARE irrational and unable to communicate. None of Hanabi or Mugi's actions are out of character or even unreasonable for someone so young struggling with depression. The REAL issue lies with Minagawa and Narumi, the unrequited loves. They are both incredibly flat and incredibly over the top to serve as foils for each other. Without getting into spoilers, Minagawa is so incredibly over the top it often pulled me out of the experience and left me wondering if her character existed solely to generate conflict. Sanae and Moka, while annoying at times, are much more palatable, and offer somewhat compelling character arcs that develop Hanabi and Mugi quite well. Every last character could be the titular \"scum\", and it is those very flaws that make them unique characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3/10):\\n\r\nI hated every minute of Kuzu no Honkai, yet I watched it in one sitting without a break. I have not one fond memory of this anime, yet I can't help but go back and listen to the soundtrack. I despise Minagawa yet can't help but feel she is the character that makes KnH so memorable. It's difficult to quantify my enjoyment because of this, but I ultimately decided that KnH is not something you watch to enjoy but to experience. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10):\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai is not for everybody, but if you are able to empathize with the characters is offers a unique experience that not much other anime do.",

            "content": "Ok, I just finish Kuzu no Honkai and I just feel the urge of talking about it. \r\nSeriously, why didn\u2019t I hear of this anime earlier ? This is just so~ good!\r\nFirst, sure it\u2019s a romance thing but it\u2019s not about teenagers blushing because they\u2019re holding hands and don\u2019t know how love \u201cwork\u201d. Seriously, this is the main reason why I can\u2019t read or watch shojo anymore. Hey, and you know what appened in this anime ? They had sex without feelings! And that is sure a thing for japanese people, you don\u2019t see that often (expect on yaoi, but that\u2019s just strange rape fantasy,you know). \\n\\n\r\nSecond, all character are just so freaking strange ans so real at the same time. Sure they\u2019re still a bit cliche but have you ever see an anime with no cliche ? So the main character was a little chick and at first I just wanted to kick her ass screaming: \u201cMove you fucking ass, bitch!\u201d but then she became a real bitch and you need to know that I love this kind of chara. Then, my god comes: Minagawa Akane. I love antagonist and she was so perfect \u2026 until they mess up in the last episode with: \u201cOh no, I finally fall in love\u201d. Shit, we were so close to my perfect type of female chara. \\n\\n\r\nThird, Yuri. Just Yuri. It\u2019s the first time that I found a correct lesbian in an anime (even if they messed her up in the last episodes too (we were so~close to the perfection)). It\u2019s just so rare to see a lesbian that is not in a Yuri, and she is not that strange type of loli fetish. (+ a bit of lesbian sex bonus)\\n\\n\r\nFourth: the ending. Even if supporting characters\u2019s ending isn\u2019t that good for most of them (except for miss princess who is riding life like hell) the main\u2019s character ending is just perfect. If I don\u2019t want to spoil I\u2019ll say that it\u2019s just the type of ending that I love to see, even more when it\u2019s about love story. But I\u2019m not a kind person so SPOILERS: BAD ENDING! I was so proud of the protagonist when they decided not to come back together. That was so good, so much more realistic than: \u201cWe\u2019re alone? Let\u2019s date!\u201d When two people can\u2019t date, they just can\u2019t. I just see too much insane love story in shojo where people were dating without even having common points! It doesn\u2019t work like that, you can\u2019t only focus in the look (even if female chara in shojo didn\u2019t have a lot inside).\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you\u2019re bored with most shojo thing and that you just want something new and quite well done, go see Kuzu no Honkai. But I can\u2019t ensure that your mental health will stay still. \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\n(not english motherlanguage)",

            "content": "Kuzu no Honkai was a series that has really pretty visuals, but the story was a borefest. Scum\u2019s Wish, as it\u2019s called in English, is pretty much just a cacophony of mixed up kids, a cuck, and a sociopath that likes to toy with and NTR her students because\u30fcshe\u2019s an awful person who can only validate herself with proving that she\u2019s the most desirable. What?\r\n\t\u2022 The manga for this was created by an up-and-coming teenage mangaka, so the reason that the story falls on its face and the characters seem so shallow may be the folly of youth. I don\u2019t particularly understand why such astory got animated with such a lovely OST and visual direction, but I\u2019m not going to question the validity of what the public wants.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 NTR\u2019ing seems to have garnered fame in the anime world, because everyone is getting off to cheating or being cheated on, I guess? There\u2019s even an anime, that isn\u2019t a hentai, called NTR about a girl cucking her boyfriend with another girl, because I guess that if it\u2019s two girls its okay because it\u2019s hot, right? \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The awful teacher is hot, so she automatically gets the Fujiko Mine/Doranjo treatment (quoting Hoozuki no Reitetsu, if you didn\u2019t notice) because she\u2019s pretty. Would anyone truly like Akane if she wasn\u2019t the hot teacher? I don\u2019t think so. Many millennial shows go into internal monologues to try to make you sympathize with the most heinous characters, like Rei from 3-Gatsu and his perpetual feel-sorry-for-me attitude. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 There\u2019s an internal monologue with Akane from Scum\u2019s Wish, but it doesn\u2019t really justify her actions. She pretty much just rants about how she\u2019s empty and superficial, and the series expects you to suddenly think that she\u2019s better because she\u2019s self-aware. Frankly, that type of thing just doesn\u2019t do it for me.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The protagonist is forgettable, though probably the most likable character. The series pulls an Oyasumi Punpun, where things hit the fan and nothing really gets better, the characters just have to move on with their lives. And I like that, but unlike Goodnight Punpun, there\u2019s no real build-up to that conclusion. It\u2019s just cheating, cheating, and more cheating. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Overall, there were some scenes that got me on the edge of my seat. As well as things that made me very uncomfortable, such as a psycho, rape-y lesbian girl who tries to slither into main girl\u2019s panties every few episodes. If you want to feel uncomfortable, then you\u2019ll for sure like this show. If not, just pass. There are shows that have much better characterizations of people with questionable morals, such as Neon Genesis Evangelion. Because of the visuals and the presentation, I give it a 5/10, but everything else was very meh for me.",

So if you're into shoujo or shounen anime, don't try to watch this anime. No use in giving people the wrong idea.  \r\nKuzu no Honkai requires alot of patience to watch. The main reason you need patience is because you'll end up hating almost all the characters towards the end. But in the last two to three episodes, things turn upside down. \r\nI watched this anime with a lot of vigorous patience and I can tell you. It'sdark. There's not a single moment in this anime where I smiled cause it's just dark in a lot of places. You'll come to hate the characters one by one, even at one point I was disgusted with the main character herself but I wanted to keep watching just for it's sake, not hoping to be disappointed. And it didn't disappoint me. \\n\\n\r\nThe makers took a ballsy move of giving an ending which makes my head hurt from the emotions. This anime takes alot of patience to watch, but if you watch it carefully and try to understand the deep emotions of each character. You'll probably like this anime. Be warned, you will be disgusted in many parts at the character's behavior, and they do have very illogical reasons, but sometimes we just do things without thinking. \\n\\n\r\nWatching this anime, you might hate it, you might dislike it. That was my general overview of the anime and how it made me feel in particular. Overall I'm decently satisfied and I think people here are two critical thinking that they could produce much better anime. Don't hate me, I'm very open-minded and I think this anime suits those who are willing to understand irrational thinking. \\n\\n\r\nThere are pros and cons to this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime was visually very beautiful, the characters designs, the shading, the animating was all in all very beautiful. The music was well developed, the story was a great, took a downfall and then the brought it back somehow to a bittersweet ending which I can understand the sequence of events. Quite a well done anime.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this anime does lack a huge character charisma, and I mean it. It makes you hate the female teacher especially. At one point I hated nearly every character though I truly couldn't bring myself to really hate the MC herself. One thing I really did not like was the high amount of lewd profanity. The story shows pretty good character development and honestly I particularly enjoyed it. However, I wouldn't say this story deserves much of a better rating that it already has. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime could've been much better, the characters could've been alot more rational with their thinking and lots of the story was unrealistic. If they had made some of the characters more likeable as well, I think this anime could've done extremely well. \\n\\n\r\nI'd rate this anime something like a 7.5, so it just didn't get 8 on my scale cause I quite fond of the \"unorthodox\" approach to romance it had. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm not writing a full-length review on the series but I will review Kuzu no Honkai's main theme and why I think the show deserves a watch.\r\nThe main theme of the show is human connection, said another way, love. The show strays from the norms of traditional romance series as well as traditional romantic conceptions of love, giving a realistic portrayal to the misery that can be had from love. Not everyone gets prince charming, only one lucky princess. This show shines the spotlight onto those runner-ups. Those people who may have loved prince charming so much they could die but were not chosen inthe end. Kuzu no Honkai is the story of such people. The story of attraction, unrequited love, and loneliness. However the show is not all melancholy, and although I see people claiming it to be a celebration of pure misery, it is in fact, the opposite. Kuzu no Honkai has one of the most uplifting messages concerning love I have seen from an anime. The message is that the road to finding love is difficult and full of pain, but the desire to find real love, to find human connection, is why we keep on living. The desire to move forward and progress, overcoming any pain along the way. We may find places in life where we are complacent, where we are warm and there is no danger but is that really living? Kuzu no Honkai shows that leaving such purgatory in search of true love(happiness) is the only way we can fulfill ourselves. That is an exemplary message of hope and a portrayal of love and life not shown enough in anime.  \\n\\n\r\nWhy should you watch Kuzu no Honkai? Because the struggle experienced in the search for one's happiness, and the pain felt along the way, is our most human condition, which we all share.\\n\\n\r\n8.5/10",

            "content": "This is my very first review here. Regarding the numerous negative reviews, that I can understand, I wanted to point out the reasons why this anime is good in its own way.\r\nWhen regarding love, have you ever felt lost? Lost in despair to the point you don\u2019t even understand your own actions, your own desires and your own thoughts? Because this is what Kuzu no Honkai (Scum\u2019s Wish) is all about.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe story is about High School students that are in love with people they can\u2019t reasonably be dating, aka their teachers. Main girl, Hanabi, has a crush on the guy who was like herbrother (not siblings). Mugi has interest in the teacher that is loved by everyone. Incapable of fulfilling their love, they both agree to replace the beloved one with a substitute, and so Hanabi and Mugi started to date.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime will tell their feelings with the situation evolving and that is pretty much it. No incredible actions or evolutions, just relationships evolving with time. The focus will be put on one of the character\u2019s thoughts each episode, and you will have a panel of different personalities that are different and realistic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\r\nYou must remind that main characters are high schoolers, not the most experienced about love interests. Learning bit by bit about the characters made them more and more realistic, interesting and understandable. Their actions are not the smartest, but the most likely to happen in such a situation. They end up doing stupid things, I sometimes felt really bad for them, but it is a thing you do not realize immediately when you make a choice. They abase themselves through their decisions to a point they look like scums, and they realize it, but they cannot fight their own decisions and accept their fate. However, the adult characters do not seem lot more mature, maybe revealing they have not really evolved since high school? It would explain their poor decisions.\\n\\n\r\nI am not myself a man of letters, but I could deeply feel the sense of poetry that was put in this story. Even though the darkness there is within all the characters, this is always told with a light note.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 9/10 \\n\r\nSupporting this, the smooth and amazing visuals, featuring either realistic characters emotions you can understand in a simple glance, or the wallpaper-quality arts that pauses the story for a short while\u2026 Not to mention the color palette with aquarelle tones that are simply astonishing, at all points of the series. Character design, although very classical, is detailed enough to be pleasant to watch. I will add special reference to the ending, with psychedelic arts that totally fits the feeling of loneliness in a world you don\u2019t understand yet.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 8/10\\n\r\nMost of the story is supported by a peaceful soundtrack that reinforces the poetry aspect. Although in-episode soundtrack was good but not memorable, opening and ending themes were actually good, I rarely skipped them. Voices are well done, nothing exceptional was attempted though, but there is no mistake that I have seen, and they really suit their characters, the mood and everything, they do a good job. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 9/10\\n\r\nIt is not aimed for all audience, clearly. I didn\u2019t feel happy or moe or anything truly positive when watching this series. I just saw realistic behavior of students that could not get what their love dictated them. I am easily affected by visuals and soundtracks, so the deeply worked arts made up for a not-so-interesting plot at first. But the characters development and seeing that they reach a state where they can then bloom with future love is more than enough to make me satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai depicts with profound reality the high schoolers experiencing love delusions. Often putting themselves in a bad spot, the viewer will feel weird and sorry for the characters. Supported by very consistent arts and sound, the story\u2019s execution can recreate situations of debauchery with an astonishing light note. This anime is all about its character\u2019s feels and evolution, which is good but does not always provide a satisfying immersion. The first episode is enough to get the very specific feel that drives this series.\\n\r\nStory \u2013 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 8/10\\n\r\nArt \u2013 9/10 \\n\r\nSound \u2013 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 9/10\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10",

            "content": "Out of all the anime that began airing during the Winter 2017, one of the first to catch my eye was 'Kuzu no Honkai'. It garnered quite a large following as it was airing, and attracted my attention just before it came to an end. So, what did I think about it? Now, speaking for myself, that question isn't exactly easy to answer, because I have a hard time saying just what I got out of this show. Nevertheless, however 'amateur' my method may be, I feel that it will do me good to just let all of my thoughts out through a review.\r\n'Kuzu noHonkai' is a rather 'dark' romance that surrounds the lives of two high-school students, Hanabi Yasuraoka and Mugi Awaya, who find themselves in quite an unconventional relationship. You see, the only reason they decide to 'get together' is because the people that they actually love are 'out of their leagues'. I apologize for being vague, but I find it difficult to explain this any further without spoiling the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe predicament that these two find themselves in is, to us viewers, interesting to say the least, and likely a deviation from what we are used to seeing. Going through the minds of people who are stuck in such a strange situation makes for quite a lot of drama and tension. In fact, the other characters also find themselves entangled in a web of deceit, trickery and what-not. Depending on the viewer, they will either find themselves highly entertained or very bored. The interactions and relationships that the characters maintain with each other serves as the driving point of the story if you ask me, and if they do not hook you then I believe that you will be left unsatisfied by 'A Scum's Wish'.\\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the characters. It needs to be established that practically every character in the story is flawed and imperfect. Of course, this would seem quite normal . However, what I mean is that, these are conflicted people, often possessing dubious morals, and they are fascinating because of how conflicted or dubious they all are. They are not virtuous, and do not act as such, and that is what draws one to them. They are all 'morally grey' so to speak. I have to give a nod to all of the characters, whether they were 'good' or not, because they all drew me in, and were all compelling in their own rights.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, at the center, we have Hanabi, the protagonist of the show, if I were to give it one. If you ask me, she is arguably the most interesting character that we are presented with. Through her queer relationship with Mugi, to the long-standing love she has for Kanai, to her friendship with Ecchan, and to the way she develops through the course of the story, she comes across as perhaps the most intriguing character in the series. Watching and understanding how conflicted she is about her relationship with Ecchan and Mugi, as well as the struggle of her unrequited love for Kanai, and all the hardships she endures throughout the story, is quite a 'ride'.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack for the series was excellent. I can't really elaborate on that. It fit the show and it also stands individually. Not to mention, 'Kuzu no Honkai' sported an ending that suited it to a 'T' thematically, and had a very fun opening as well. I can say the same for the art. I personally thought that it was fantastic. The colors used in the show were great, and I want to give props to the staff for deciding on such a marvelous color palette. The animation was also great if you ask me, but I am no expert on animation.\\n\\n\r\nMany people here think that 'Kuzu no Honkai' was depressing for no particular reason, and that it needlessly pulled off unnecessary stunts. People knock on its story as well for being simplistic, and also may find its characters shallow and uninteresting. However, I am not someone who shares those opinions. However, they are as valid as mine, but I believe that if you want an honest opinion on the show, you should give it a try so you can formulate your own. Indeed, I do not believe that the show is perfect. I too feel that it has some flaws in the story department, and even in the character department that I showered with so much praise, but I hold that it is a solid anime worth your time if you are looking for a 'different' kind of romance. I hope I managed to hold your attention with this review. Thank you for your time.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers:\r\nScums Wish is definitely not your average Romance anime because it can get pretty dark at times which is definitely something I don't see often in Romance anime.\r\nThe story focused on Hanabi and Mugi who both liked someone who are their teachers so they decide to mess around with each other to satisfy their needs then suddenly a lot of bad stuff happens to the both of them, it was interesting seeing the events unfold between these two characters as other people who also had crushes on them either had their heart broken or saw that person in a new viewpoint which fora couple of characters surprised me and the way the show ended surprised me too.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters feelings would change a lot throughout the show going from guilty, confused, depressed to eventually being relieved and a lot of stuff happens between the characters as they couldn't make up their mind with who they want to be with which made the situation more difficult between them like at some points both Hanabi and Mugi break someone elses heart because they either didn't feel the same way or were just using them. The way i felt about the characters changed a lot throughout the show and by the end I felt like most of them deserved their outcome.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the artstyle it reminded me of another anime that I can't quite place my finger one, but the anime looked very nice at times. \\n\\n\r\nNow of course there is nudity in this anime along with a few sex scenes, but it doesn't reveal the full body or body parts that everyone loves to see, it feels very mature and is probably the reason why the Ecchi tag isn't in the genres that are shown \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a Romance that isn't all feel good type and actually want a Romance that is actually pretty messed up and is a bit convoluted then this is definitely a good watch \\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019m still not entirely sure whether I was supposed to fap to this or not.\r\nStory:\r\nHanabi loves her teacher Narumi, who loves another teacher, Akane. Mugi is also in love with Akane, despite being a student. Hanabi and Mugi decide to have a purely physical relationship. However, Ecchan is in love with Hanabi and Moka is in love with Mugi. Now you might wonder, who is Akane in love with? Nobody, she just likes to fuck and steal other girls\u2019 love interests. Does this sound like a good story to you? Probably, if you\u2019re a 13-15 year old girl. But all kidding aside, love triangles (orsquares or whatever) can be entertaining if done well. Some people praised Scum\u2019s Wish for its realistic portrayal of teenagers, which I agree on to a certain degree. Of course there are admissions that need to be made for a work of fiction to work, but in general I can say that yes, teenagers tend to overdramatize everything, especially when it comes to love and yes, they care about fucking. The way this anime tells its story can be considered lame and wrong, after all the general idea of a visual medium is \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d and that is a reasonable point of criticism here. For me, this way of storytelling was not a huge problem, most of what happens here happens inside the characters heads (or in bed), so it makes sense to do it this way. Then again, this makes it obvious that an anime may not have been the best possible medium for this story. As you can guess, there is no happy end for everybody, but to my surprise, it also wasn\u2019t a teenage drama bad end with everybody being miserable or committing sudoku. It still wasn\u2019t satisfying for reasons that I don\u2019t want to spoil too much, let\u2019s just say that the decisions that were made weren\u2019t decisions that a logical human being would make, which was the point this anime was trying to get across in the first place, making its realistic approach a little pointless.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai looks really, really good. There are a lot of warm colors all throughout this anime, which are very pleasant to the eye. In contrast, there are quite a few scene transitions that have a clouding effect, fading to black, fitting the tone of many of the inner monologues the characters have when depressed or angry or anything like that. Everything runs very smoothly. Some people have criticized the use of panels during the monologues. To me it feels necessary to pull little tricks like that to make the anime watchable, I mean, imagine the characters just standing there doing nothing while we hear their thoughts. This is more of a problem of the storytelling than it is a problem of the animation. The character design looks good to me, a little on the shoujo side if you know what I mean, but by far not as bad as other anime are. Maybe the characters are all a little too pretty, then again, they are so supposed to be, at least the main cast.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI loved the opening song. It\u2019s incredibly hectic and tense. Quite fitting for a show like this where everyone is somewhat torn apart on the inside and indecisive and unsure in their behaviour. It\u2019s also just a very good song. The ending is also quite good, sung by Sayuri who also did the very good ending for Erased. She\u2019s like an ending specialist or something. The rest of the soundtrack was pretty good as well, there seems to be a general tendency towards more orchestral work recently, something I highly approve of. The voice acting was mostly solid, no exceptional performances but no complete disasters either. Chika Anzai tries her hardest to sound exactly like Kana Hanazawa and she does a really good job with that. It\u2019s questionable though if that is a good thing or if it weren\u2019t better to try to find your own style.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nLet me be honest here. If you find any of these characters to be relatable, I would recommend visiting a psychiatrist. The English title of this anime is Scum\u2019s Wish for a reason. Every main character is a horrible person, some more, some less. Hanabi is a text book example of what people may consider an emo teen. Her love is unrequited, therefore her life is meaningless, or so she thinks. Due to her naivety she decides to give her body away to ease the pain, which obviously doesn\u2019t work. She is a very indecisive girl and has no idea what to do with herself, so she lets herself be used like a sex doll and only stops short of vaginal intercourse. Her fake boyfriend Mugi is a dick in every way. First he decides to have some sexy time with the emotionally vulnerable Hanabi (which some people might consider a form of sexual exploitation), then he tries to fuck everything in his path and finally he just completely ignores Hanabi in her darkest hour after gaining access to his teachers pussy. He doesn\u2019t even apologize later on, he just doesn\u2019t care the least bit. Akane is the worst of them all. As I mentioned before, she loves fucking around, as long as the dude she screws has a girl who is in love with him. She is an awful human being by any definition with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Her completely unbelievable character development doesn\u2019t even give her any, that\u2019s how big a piece of shit she is. She even mocks her students for fucking their boyfriends, I mean come on. That\u2019s a level of ridiculous villainy that only cartoon characters can reach. Oh\u2026touch\u00e9 I guess. Narumi has no character traits besides smiling all the time and being happy his love interest is a whore. Ecchan is an egotistical, aggressive sexual offender who thinks about herself first and herself second. She keeps on sexually assaulting Hanabi and tries to turn it around so that she somehow comes off as the victim. Worst of all, she never gets called out on all this. Oh, I think she also has a cousin who is in love with her, but that\u2019s never in any way relevant to the plot. Finally we have Moka, who is also hardly relevant to the series, but she gets her very own episode. Ironically, she, who appeared to be the most childish and innocent of the whole cast , turned out to be the most mature and the first to overcome her na\u00efve teenage dreams and accept reality into her life. Now, this all sounds like I really hate the cast of Scum\u2019s Wish, doesn\u2019t it? But that is the whole point, they are, after all, scum. What really hurts them are their illogical decisions and actions, those keep pulling on my suspension of disbelief a little to often.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEnjoyment is such a weird word for a series like this. Kuzu no Honkai isn\u2019t supposed to bring you joy and happiness. Entertainment yes, but enjoyment? But I digress. I\u2019d say the creators were trying to make the viewer uncomfortable with all the teenage sexuality thrown at us in a world were moe girls are blushing when thinking about holding hands. Well, they succeeded with that, though I\u2019m not sure if I cringed because of the sexual content or because of the way it was handled. It\u2019s certainly not entirely bad, but if the premise is a realistic portrayal of the sexuality of teenagers and adults with serious issues, I would have liked it to be less clich\u00e9d and illogical. Many of the behaviours were in fact not realistic and I somehow got the feeling that this show embraces its soft porn tendencies to market itself, which is contradicting the intended awkwardness of said scenes. It wasn\u2019t a bad show, but it failed in getting its point across and could have been better if it was handled more carefully.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n7.2/10",

            "content": "Hi,\r\nSo this is my first time writing a review about an anime I\u2019ve seen but once you\u2019ve seen Scum\u2019s Wish it\u2019s hard for me to not speak up about it. Spoilers below\r\nFirst the music is a 10/10. The intro song is fairly dark, which Scun\u2019s Wish is nothing but a dark romance. It\u2019s boardline ecchi to some, but I think that\u2019s also what make so different from so many other romance anime\u2019s.\r\nLet\u2019s move on to characters, Hanabi is a confused soul, who finds comfort in a man she begins to have feelings for because she can\u2019t be with the guy she truly wants to bewith. She continues throughout the anime to try to fill an empty void within herself through various relationships, while dreaming of the man she believes she\u2019s meant to be with. The other characters often tend to act on their own selfish desires, not one character in this anime is without flaws, it\u2019s beautiful!\\n\\n\r\nArt is very different and I think it draws me into the anime more because of this.\\n\\n\r\nEnding, is truly original, she realizes that she cannot continue a toxic relationship, in most romance anime\u2019s they always end up together. But Scum\u2019s Wish tells the truth about relationships and even though you may love someone they might not be the right person for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you can get past the ecchi scenes, you\u2019ll find the beauty behind the story and I think you will truly love the real ness that this anime has to it. While the ending is a bit sad, it tells the bitter truth of love.",

            "content": "No doubt \"mature\" shows are hard to get right, it's too easy to just put sex in a show because sex sells.  Kuzu no Honkai straddles that line.  Sometimes it seems only voyeuristic, at other times it shows real substance.  In the end it has enough substance to earn a recommendation.\r\nThis is a fresh look at love.  In Kuzu no Honkai, love is stripped of all its romance.  It's awkward, everyone has different desires, sometimes terrible desires, and people make real mistakes trying to get the love that they need.  And yet the show avoids devolving into pure fanservice and avoids taking the easy, cynical way out.  This isn't School Days.  In other words, the show avoids cliches but isn't just some deconstruction.\\n\\n\r\nThe good parts--the story and characters are fairly solid.  The show actually does leave you wondering what's going to happen next, right until the very last episode.  It always looks like the show is setting you up for some cliche character arc but the characters are a little too real to follow the cliches.  OP and ED are fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad parts--I'm not a fan of the way still images are cut into the show.  The second half of the show focuses on Akane, the music teacher, a bit excessively.  It's not that she's a bad character, it's just that her character can't carry the show, and she's subject to the navel-gazing that plagues anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway--if you're looking for something a bit different, and a bit more focused on adult issues, this is a solid choice.",

            "content": "Have you ever wondered what life would be like if we didn't listen to our moral compass? Have you ever wanted to bake your cake and eat it too? Have you ever tried to make out with your best friend even though you knew it would tear apart your relationship but you wanted to feel good for that one night? Well, Kuzu no Honkai is right up your alley.\r\nKuzu no Honkai is the beautifully tragic (slightly X-rated) coming-of-age story that pushes the boundaries of societies definitions of relationships and sexual conduct. This is one of those shows that feels so wrong but so good atthe same time. You struggle through young teen relationships and sexual exploration over and over again as you cry for your one true pair to make it through the despair. The only people who would absolutely love this show are the type of people who like to see characters struggle, fail, learn from themselves and act upon their discoveries. There will be a lot of struggling and a lot of mistakes but with that, a lot of self-satisfaction. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is truly refreshing, a lot of mellow watercolors that set the tone of the show to be pretty glum/anxious. The character designs are simple yet natural and believable. Usage of flashbacks and other screen caps/time skips are very well done and needed as the pacing of the story is pretty quick. The sound is absolutely incredible as the OP is pretty good but the ED is by far my favorite of the season. Key moments are highlighted very well with the OST and gave me chills almost every time. The only downside to the show is the pacing of the story is so quick that it's hard to follow the characters intentions or time very well. Every episode is jam packed with drama and immense characterization/development that the show loses some verisimilitude but that's what you get from a 12 episode series, and I think they still pulled off a great deal. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I absolutely adored the wild ride that was Kuzu no Honkai. It's ecchi, it's raw, it's dramatic, it's everything you're not supposed to do in a relationship, it's different and it's satisfying. I wouldn't recommend this to younger viewers, maybe high school age because the students are high schoolers but mostly to people who have experienced love and heartache and know that life still goes on when things don't work out, and that's the beauty of this all. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I typically write reviews that are spoiler free and don't go into much depth because of this fact, but I've been seeing a lot of other opinions that are very opposite of mine and would like to share why I feel so strongly about this show. In life, I feel like there are always at least 2 options to most social situations. The safe, easy route where you avoid as much conflict as possible and the route is considered the \"smart\" decision. And then the route less taken, seen more as a \"stupid\" decision and the one that will take more courage/effort to get out of. This show is about taking the \"stupid\" route, having the courage to face your wrongdoings and try to fix that. This would make a ton of people uncomfortable and is off-putting, but for me, it's very satisfying to see the \"wrong\" side of life and see that it's okay to mess up several times, as long as you have the strength and courage to continue on.",

            "content": "Kuzu no honkai, also known as, a scum\u2019s wish. \r\nFrom the moment they announced this anime, it had caught my interest. I was very intrigued by the concept of a tragic love story. A one-sided love, which caused so much emptiness you decide to fill it with someone else, who is also using you for the same reasons. Sounds interesting right? Well, it\u2019s a waste of time\u2026.\r\nThe whole concept of loneliness/emptiness or all those other depressed emotions is thrown out of the window as the sexual tension rises. \r\nIn the beginning, I liked it, but soon I was bothered by the overuse of sexual interactions.After a few episodes, they looked more like people who have too much sexual frustration instead of severe loneliness or emptiness. \\n\r\nIt took over the show for me. I was thinking every episode \u2018who\u2019s gonna take who this episode?\u2019 \u2018Who is going to cheat this time?\u2019 \\n\\n\r\nSo\u2026..The characters\u2026\\n\r\nThe main character is indeed quite the scum, but they overdid it a little. At one point you would ask yourself like \u2018what am I doing with my life?\u2019 \\n\r\nThe guy she fake dates reminded me of the guy from school days, which is a bad thing. \\n\r\nThe teacher she loves is exactly the most decent character in this show, but he has too little screen time to make a good character out of him.\\n\r\nThe female teacher is just a bad character and I mean not in a villain way, but just a terrible character. How could someone still love her after knowing her real personality? Everyone who she betrayed could have easily gotten her fired from her job, but that\u2019s not really important to the show\u2026\\n\\n\r\nEveryone in this show was just on too many hormones and this ruined it for me. \\n\\n\r\nTo say something positive, I liked the art style.\\n\\n\r\nSo, this was quite the disappointment. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Kuzu no Honkai is a story about love and the different forms that it comes in, and how it affects us as human beings. the story starts off already with a predicament concerning the love of our main characters Mugi and Hanabi.  two students who have in some sense unrequited love for two teachers in the school Akane and Narumi respectively. since both of them know that it is impossible to be with their teachers it seems the next logical step(for some reason) would be to date each other in the sense of licking/soothing each others wound and be the replacement for the onesthey love. however this just feels contrived as it just puts two characters together for the sake of the drama that will unfold in the later episodes. yes you can say that it's young dumb love, but that comes to head to how not dumb the show is trying to make these characters to be. since pretty much each main cast member has pretty long monologues that take up a large chunks of the show about them thinking about their action, what it means to love, and pretty much going around in circles were in the end most of it feels pointless.\\n\r\ntwo more characters are then introduced one to fill in the child-hood friend love, and the other to fill in the \"just friends\" love with and added lesbianism; with both thrown in to added more fuel to the drama in the show.confrontations, confessions, heartbreak, reconciliation and long winded internal monologue ensue all to lead to an ending that was lackluster, and had me thinking what was the point of this show? because in the end, it just felt like angsty teenage drama that was so forced it had more penetration than any of the sex scenes in this show put together. this also made me wonder what was so mature about this show? was it the sex scenes? because that just feels more like mature content. was it the internal monologues? because those just felt tiring and recitative.  was it the presentation? because this is the only thing i can think of, and even then it's not much. this just felt like a pointless and contrived story that i know was trying to do something \"different\", but completely failed upon witing and execution.\\n\r\nalso the comedic moments just felt out of place in this show\\n\\n\r\n looking at the characters there isn't much really going for them.the show mostly focuses on who each character likes rather than who each character is.  Mugi likes Akane, Hanabi likes Narumi, Mugi and Hanabi are soothing each other, Sanae like Hanabi, Noriko likes Mugi, Narumi likes Akane, and Akane just likes men. the most fleshing out that a character gets from the show mostly comes from the flashbacks that the characters have that made them the way they are, and/or why they like the person they like. you won't get much depth from them even the internal monologues add nothing new to the characters that we don't already know about. there's a lot to left to be desired from these characters that are just looked over for the sake of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis show really does set itself apart from other romance/drama anime with its art-style. several frames and most of the still frames look fantastic, and the color pallet, background, and character designs(however the younger males seem to suffer from same face syndrom) looks rather nice. however this is where the line ends. either be it artistic decision or not there is always this heavy usage of panel shots and the screen turning foggy black. yes this can be used to look at many different character perspectives at once, but that comes to question when at times those shots have in them just a glass of juice or a tree rather than anything important in the story they want to show the viewers. yes the black smoke is to show about the corruption of the characters, but they just relentlessly hammer it into you like you might not understand what's going on and this goes for any other sort of symbolism that they try to show since they're rather on the nose about it. however there's is kinda of a payoff at the end with the black smoke turning to white smoke, but by then it was pretty obvious it was to happen eventually. it just makes it feel like they just checked the boxes of having these in each episode instead of instilling any grand meaning into them. \\n\r\nthe animation is what it is for this kind of show\\n\\n\r\n the voice acting was ok, but i never found any of the voices appealing. a lot of the voice acting from the women sounded annoying especially from the childhood friend character. since most of the voice acting for the males was Mugi i found him to be rather bland. pretty much all the voices made the characters sound uninterested of what is going on. the Ost was decent to say the least, but not much to really stand out on itself.\\n\\n\r\nin terms of enjoyment i was bored, but i gotta see what this show was all about from beginning to end. OK time killer\\n\\n\r\noverall it tried so hard and went not that far, but in the end is doesn't really matter. the writing and characters are below average. it's aesthetic  and presentation are very good, but has several flaws. the sound was a big miss for me. nonetheless it was an OK experience that i would like to experience, but with better characters and writing.\\n",

Also the slice of life was also unique since in includes some unexpectedness that one would either understand it or be disgustby it.\\n\\n\r\nFair 6, Art.\\n\\n\r\nMAL has warn us about some mild nudity, but the only nudity you'll see was with Ecchan's panty shot and some angles were it kinda look like that Hanabi is going commando.

Characters\\n\\n\r\nOk let's go over each of them:\\n\\n\r\nHanabi Yasuraoka X Mugi Awaya, both were in loved with their teacher given that they already had a relationship when they were younger, the problem was, Hanabi juggles from having a yuri relationship with Ebato to a normal relationship with Mugi,  her character was simply too complicated to understand, since she has to paddle her way to three rivers where one is her goal to be in a relationship with  Narumi Kanai who was her teacher/ childhood friend/ onichan, the other river where she is having 2nd thoughts of being lovers with Mugi and the last river was being in a lesbian relationship with Ebato, what's annoying about her was her trying to have a relationship with one of Akane's man bitch,  Takuya Terauchi. The same goes for Mugi, he's having some conflict of whether he should be  in a relationship with Hanabi, continue to be Aakne's man bitch and being a lolicon with  Noriko Kamomebata, also I very much pissed that despite of Akane's infidelity, he still continues to love her and is even willing to be one of her man bitch. Frankly, just those two alone were simply pathetic to the bone.\\n\\n\r\nNarumi Kanai, who happens to be Hanabi older childhood friend is another reason for the low score was my disgust for him , in which he prefers to be Akane's man bitch instead of having to wait for Hanabi to turn 18 so that he can bang her and be his wife, in the end he's too foolish to even forgive Akane's sexual adventure with her man bitches and even choose to marry her.\\n\\n\r\nAkane Minagawa, everyone would agree with me that she was a character that everyone would love to hate, so much so, that we'd wish that Kanai and Mugi would despise her but no and they even become one of her man bitches.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSanae Ebato, basically she is the bokuko here and she forms a yuri element here, but she a double standard, she has the guts to hit her cousin whom obviously have some feelings for her, when she is annoyed, but she a pussy against a predator who was  sexually harassing her on the train, frankly she one character whom I like to see get raped by her cousin.... or that predator on the train for that matter.\\n\\n\r\n Noriko Kamomebata. she just a loli element here, whom I like getting owned by Hanabi.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFair 6, enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI do enjoy watching this 12 episode anime, the down side was the characters themselves whom were a disappointment, especially when the Hanabi X Mugi never transpire beyond just as replacements with each other, too bad it had to end on a sour note.\\n\\n\r\nFair 6. Overall.\\n\\n\r\nDo enjoy, but don't expect a good ending.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOUT!!!!!!   \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kuzu no Honkai is somewhat painful to watch. Some people find this anime uncomfortable, and I can see why, but that's the appeal. In Scum's Wish, the characters act like real people - and people can be scum. This is definitely a highlight of 2017.\r\nStory - 8\r\nAs with many romantic dramas, explaining who likes who and what goes on is quite difficult. But I will try my best to hit the notable points. Hanabi and Mugi are both in love with a teacher who they've known for a while but who like each other. The two high schoolers start dating and using each other asa placeholder. They both also have another girl who likes them too, and Mugi's crush Akane is actually a manipulative bitch. The ending may seem off for some but I thought it perfectly matched the show. Also, the sexual content is there but it's not gratuitous or intrusive.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\r\nThis is where Kuzu no Honkai shines brightest, simply because the cast acts like real, flawed people. We get jealous. We can be manipulative. We let our lust take over. We feel things and we don't know why. We're deeply flawed individuals in a world full of other people who are worse than garbage. The level of depressing humanity that this show is able to portray is frankly amazing. You don't see this often in anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Music - 7\\n\r\nI do like the art style, but the manga-esque direction was a bit jarring at times, and the OST did its job but was just there. The opening, though, is worth noting. It's honestly a perfect fit.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment - 9\\n\r\nI did a lot of binge-watching, and if I remember correctly, finished in a few days. All throughout, the outstanding characters and human drama kept me hooked. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nScum's Wish is only 12 episodes, and it's very good. I can't think of any reason for you to at least give it a try. It's definitely worth it, in my opinion. If you are tired of the idealized predictability of romantic fiction, you'll especially appreciate this.",

            "content": "Story: 10\r\nI would like to say this one captured my interest instantly. Kuzu no Honkai gave a very deep storyline on the struggles of one-sided loves. I was able to understand it well, especially because, even as an animated series, it was very realistic. While watching this I was thinking of how this situation actually comes up more often than I had imagined before. Is it really all that bad to create a relationship with an irrelevant person to save yourself from loneliness from being unable to be with the person you love? Is it really just physical intimacy that makes up for that? Isit really love? \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nBeautiful artwork. I enjoyed how clear the setting was while the characters looked like they were taken directly from the manga. Again, it felt very realistic with how natural the scenery looked in comparison to a bright and colorful one like in many shoujo/shounen. \\n\\n\r\nLOVED the voice actors. Because of how well it was put with their character, I felt like I was able to see the story through their eyes. \\n\r\nLOVED the opening and ending. It fit in almost perfectly with each episode's start and finish.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I am giving this a 10. \\n\r\nDoes seem a tad extreme, but I have no other choice. This anime was beautiful and the story was amazing and relatable. \\n\\n\r\nWatch it!!",

However even though the character interactions often feel forced and over the top (everybody sleeps with everybody else and everybody is hurt), as is typical for drama shows, the series can't be called bad. \r\nActually the drama in this show is often times reflected very intelligently. The topic of the teenager desperatly trying to find a place in a world that turned out to be far more cruel than ever expected is realized well inthis anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to rate this show.\\n\r\nIt is intelligent and self aware.\\n\r\nHowever it overtunes everything like any cheap drama show and this almost makes me hate it.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all: If some brutal, provocative drama is what you are looking for, watch this one, at least it is smart with the way it uses drama.\\n\r\nIf this is not your genre, this anime wont do anything good for you.",

            "content": "'Let's break free of the solar system and intersect our parallel lines \r\nParallel lines that stretch on like our shadows''\r\nStory (8)\r\nKuzu no Honkai or else Scum's wish , is  a very deep thought anime , with a plot twists and a lot of emotions portrait  in the characters. The anime start with our two protagonist (Migu and Hanabii) ,  two freshmen high schoolers that they find their first love,  and they want to make them theirs. And so we see them to try to express their feelings , their emotions ,  something so easy but also so hard .Ok, u can say now that this is typically romantic shoujo story ,with typical romantic relationships between the protagonists etc.But no it is not only that. As i said above, this anime has   deep thought , and will make you realize that sometimes, the love and friends is something very complicated . Everyone want their happy ending but the life play with us , and the things that we want  or we think that we want  don't always come true. Moreover  who said that  the real love is only one in our life, and only one type? \\n\\n\r\nArt(7)\\n\r\nThe art is fine, well it is not the powerful characteristic of the anime,  it is   kawai and at the same time beautiful. Particularly  when we see the characters in their  emotions stress etc.\\n\\n\r\nSound(8)\\n\r\nThe voice actors are also the perfect selection for the characters .The change in their tone , the broken voices in times of sadness, or when they are in pain, etc . Also, i fall in love with the ending song , it was a good choice for the anime, cause also portrait the emotions of our young protagonists, their emptiness, and their losses in the name of love.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(8)\\n\r\nAnd here we are\u2026 The reason that I liked so much this anime. In the start u will think that the characters are very immature , childish and spoiled. If you think about it , everyone they are immature childish and sometimes stupid when it comes to love. Relationships between the people they are hard and complicated. So we see our characters, to develop emotions that they can\u2019t explain , like the most real people. Kuzu no Honkai portrait psychology expressions in characters and succeed it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(7)\\n\r\nAnd finally , this anime made me realize more, that everyone they have a different way to express their feelings , and it is becomes more complicated , if you leave your chance to express them. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, i want to say that if you are looking for an anime light with comedy well this anime sure is not that ...   a lot of people they are don' t agree  with the ending (dont worry i wont spoil anything), but if you think it about it and analyze it a little is the most suitable for this story!!! :)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you  for reading my review , and i hope you enjoy this anime as well as i did. \\n\r\nP.S It is my first time writing a review , so sorry for my inexperienced mistakes !!:)\\n",

No, most of these characters are trash, but that is not all that there is to it.\r\nAs flaws I'd say you could question their actions or motivations at some points, while some are just hard to understand, and you might miss the underlines(I know I did a couple of times, till I thought about it and endedup watching episode analysis),some other ones are straight up forced/unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with people(not the anime), is that they don't relate to scum, they want scum to just stop being scum, \"just stop already, and do what I agree with doing\", thus hate on it.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime dares to be different(this is so rare), and at the end of the anime I ended up feeling like it was worth the watch, more than any of those romcom that have no real ending(Kuzu no Hokai does end), on the middle I was about to drop it tbh, in fact I felt dragged 1 or 2 episodes(not more), characters develop, not always as you expect, but they do evolve.\\n\\n\r\n So while it's def not for everyone, if you can be open-minded and you are not new into anime, I think Scum's Wish is worth the watch(aside from 1 or 2 episodes in the middle, just gotta hand in there).",

And I also do like Anime with school settings, so this seemed perfect. And at the beginning it seemed like a typicall highschool girl, highschool boy love thingy. The characters seemed decent and likeable. But they're not! And that's my biggest problem with this show. Music and art are pretty nice, but the characters and thus the story ruined it for me. \r\nThere should be just no way, that every single person involved in a love triangle, or should I say, love heptagon, iscompletely horrible. In this show, it's possible! They don't have any values, nor character traits that make them actually likable. In fact, they are all selfish and/or are completely lacking of backbone. No one is able to stand up for him- or herself and to make somewhat comprehensible decicions. Nobody seems to give a damn about their choices and how they affect others. \\n\\n\r\nThis show just doesn't offer decent and somewhat comprehensible storytelling whatsoever. When you make all your characters assholes, just give me one reason to like any of them! Don't get me wrong, normally I'm the kind of person, who really likes the \"bad guys\", the typical assholes, who just don't give a shit. But here you are expected to give a shit about those characters, when they offer you nothing to be able to do so. Characters so shallow and full of themselves are normally the grain of salt, that make shows like this interesting. But making a show only out of such characters, isn't working for me.",

Now just a warning this anime really fucks with your feelings its an NTR anime so you're in for some heart break, overall this story portrays what really happens in real life which we rarely ever see in anime these days.\r\nCharacters 9/10--- The character development is quite strong in this one, the two main characters became quite mature coming to end of theshow and they both accepted one another for who they are.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART 7/10-- The art style is quite beautiful I for one really like not much to be said here.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10--- This is how you do sounds in anime, the anime Op and ED was magnificent and wonderful I really enjoyed it and most of the sounds used fitted the genre this anime fell under.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10--- Although the anime didn't end the way I wanted it too, I really enjoyed this series as I can related to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall for me this was a really good anime and I really enjoyed I was left depressed but it was worth it I hope we can get a sequel or something one day.\\n",

The story is a set up for an easy run of the mill romantic drama but they take it in a beautiful and painfully real way.\r\n Dealing with heavy emotions feelings of loneliness and vulnerability alongside stunning visuals and a gorgeous soundtrack that is defiantly unique. I found many of these topics very relatable  and enthralling in a very creative and all to \"close to home\" way. LGBTQ representation was commendable as not a joke or \"silly and trivial\" way which is very muchappreciated. Perhaps not for everyone but personally I Loved this one would recommend to many.",

            "content": "How much will you sacrifice for the sake of love? How will you control your desires if it's an unrequited love? Will you go to the extent of giving up your ideals and morals just so you can quench the whimsical desires of your heart? Doesn't that make you no better than trash? A scum? Well, that's exactly what Kuzu no Honkai is about!\r\nThis is not your lovey-dovey romance tale. Everything here is dark, miserable, pathetic, insane and dangerously so. This is under the seinen tag for a reason after all. Though it revolves around high school students, I think teenagers might hardly be ableto grasp the core of the story line. Only those who've been through enough shit that the world has to offer, might be able to get the idea behind this.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't teach us a lesson by being sad and twisted. There's no retribution to be found here. It simply serves as a window into the complex love life of a few people, which is clumsy and messed up like hell, and then proceeds to end by closing the window just as easily as it opened, without letting us solve anything or find proper closure.\\n\\n\r\nThe first few things that made me like this series were 2 components - Art and Music. I love the character designs, though they seem like an imitation of each other only with a slight change in hair color or other physical attributes. Their eyes - they feel so numb and lifeless, and helps more in defining how lost these characters are. The color tone used is kept soft and mellow and it fits the story setting perfectly. The manga style frames makes the narrative interesting as well. The OP/ED songs fit like a glove and are pleasing to listen to, not to mention all the foreshadowing shown through visuals and that unique kaleidoscopic view. The OST is mesmerizing with the soft piano music adding to the already heavy air of endless misery. I loved it through and through.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the story line and the characterization.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that easily made me love this series is, it was daring to portray physical intimacy as it should be, without slipping into the hentai territory or being just a fanservice content. In all honestly, I've felt ten times more uncomfortable watching ecchi in so many popular anime than the scenes here. It shows as much as the story necessitates, and leaves it there. It's quite realistic in that sense, since humans crave for it one way or another, and there's no point being in denial about it like many other anime do. Rather than turning me on, all that these scenes did was help me find my way deep into darkness, as each of the characters kept ruining themselves splendidly. Each character keeps giving a piece of their mind in all of the NSFW scenes, and that narrative adds more depth to them, instead of being toned down pornographic content. \\n\\n\r\nAnd also it doesn't give a damn about your ideal couple. Loving someone who's your teacher. Loving someone who's of same gender. Loving someone whom you've considered your brother. Loving someone whom you've known since childhood. It just breaks through all those boundaries and gives you emotions as raw as they can be.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, it is very much plausible how fragile and twisted people can be as it is shown here. After all love and its related feelings are so complicated to begin with. There really is no single definition for it. And each of these people are given their own narrative to explain their way of thinking and their actions. Funnily, they all know how much of a scum they are, how much they are deluded, and still don't feel any remorse.  \\n\\n\r\nHanabi is this popular school kid who can get anyone if she wanted. But the one person she wants seems unreachable, just because she fears losing him by revealing her true feelings. Then she replaces him with Mugi, just so that her physical needs are met. When she realizes it's only about filling up the void, she doesn't care who it is, so ends up taking advantage of Sanae. If this wasn't enough she challenges herself to get the better of Akane by snatching up all those who love her. Atleast now does she realize that she's already gone too far?\\n\\n\r\nMugi is equally popular among girls, smart, good looking. But he got used to being toyed with sexually by someone and being thrown away, at a young age. So he doesn't mind doing the same with others. When the person he desires, Akane, seems unavailable, he replaces her with Hanabi. Then proceeds to use just about anyone to quench his lust. This is the one person who figured Akane's personality and attitude inside out, so much that he could predict her moves even. Still kept loving her no matter what. When finally Akane herself surprisingly comes to his side, he chooses to stay with her and change her. But can he? Is it really what he wants?\\n\\n\r\nNarumi is Hanabi's neighbour, who grew up with her like a brother. Completely naive, sweet and caring, the ideal fairy tale prince. Someone who was unlucky enough to be trapped in Akane's lust for destroying Hanabi's dreams. He loves Akane unconditionally, even after getting to know her true personality. Can his pure love melt down Akane's promiscuous heart? \\n\\n\r\nAkane is this standard slut in every way possible. I usually don't refer to anyone that way, just because a woman has a healthy sex drive, but this lady is an exception. She doesn't do it for lust alone. She does it so that she can see another woman cripple and crumble before her. She does it to ascertain her superiority. She does it to fill up her void, because that's the only thing she knows how to do - use other men's affections for her to feed her ego and narcissism. Does she find salvation in Narumi atleast?\\n\\n\r\nSanae is the only girl pal of Hanabi, but she ends up falling for Hanabi, and that complicates things. She wants to be with the person she loves no matter what, so she doesn't mind being used as a replacement. She has a cousin, Atsuya who loves her dearly, but will she return his affections or keep destroying herself?\\n\\n\r\nNoriko is Mugi's childhood friend. She's always had a crush on him. She knows he'll never be hers, so decides to spend as much time with him as possible, to her heart's content. Though she's flawed, I did find her interesting because she had the strength enough to realize her self worth a lot sooner than many others. Will it be enough to push her forward or will she be trapped in her dream eternally?\\n\\n\r\nHardly there's a character you'd like in here. They are all flawed to the core that you end up hating each of them. Maybe that's the whole point. You are supposed to hate them. We are only humans after all. Every character deserves the pain they are in, only because they consciously pursue that dark path knowing full well it's only going to give them more and more pain. The one character I really liked was Narumi. So pure and kind in every way. Somehow I felt Hanabi and Narumi would've made a nice couple since they seem to balance each other. Then there's Atsuya, though he has very less screen time seemed to be an interesting person. I found the scenes with Atsuya and Sanae to be really cute, and they made me smile now and then. \\n\\n\r\nThe moment you see a 'friends-with-benefits' kind of thing, you think everything seems predictable from then onwards. But is it really? The ending, the one thing that I desperately wanted for the sake of closure atleast, never materialized. That was the surprise right there. After all, life is like that. It doesn't always give us happy endings. It throws us unexpected twists and lets us deal with it silently. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the things though makes you question the validity of it. Like, when Narumi consciously says he's absolutely okay about Akane dating or sleeping with other men, it threw me off. I kept wondering how is it even possible. Sure, if I'm pining for someone's love so much so that I'm ready to ignore whether they already have a girlfriend or boyfriend, 'cause all that I desperately need is to be with them even if I have to share them with someone else, it's understandable. Love will make you twisted. But, once I get it though, somewhere in long run, I sure am gonna want that person all to myself. That possessiveness blooms naturally. Which is why I find it hard to believe. Then again, we live in a world where polygamy tends to exist, and one man is shared between 10 women legally, I guess anything is acceptable from that point of view.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say I enjoyed watching this show. There's nothing to derive joy from in here. Rather I found it very interesting and captivating to pursue till the end. A lot of people might call this show pointless and messed up. I respectfully disagree. Each person has there own opinion of course. The thing is, each person's connect with a character or story depends on their own personal experiences. Since our life stories differ from one another,  our opinion about an art medium varies in accordance with it. Maybe it's because I can relate with some of the twisted mindset of these characters, or maybe because I had my heartbroken just recently, and so that's why I find this interesting. In any way, this is certainly one of the best shows I've watched in romance genre, in terms of representing the darker side of love and human mind.\\n\\n\r\nGive it a try if you are adult enough to break out of the monotony of stereotypical love stories. 6 hours of unpolished insanity awaits you!\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10 (Sanae, Narumi, Atsuya needed more depth)\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10",

            "content": "Kuzu no Honkai was an unfortunate disappointment for me in the Winter 2017 season. For a show that started off with a somewhat interesting take on the generic high school romance genre, I had to force myself to finish the second half as it turned into what I can only describe as a \u201cshit show\u201d.\r\nStory: 3\r\nBuckle up kids : It\u2019s a bumpy ride. The story is what originally drew me into this show. I was happy to see unrequited love where not only are the protagonists fully aware that their feelings aren\u2019t returned, but they actually try to work around it. However, inthe first episode, I quickly learned that I wouldn\u2019t be able to take any plot developments seriously. I was surprised when the first erotic scene started. I\u2019m no stranger to ecchi and I\u2019m not at all surprised that it happened in a seinen, but rather that\u2019s all I remember. Each time something major happened to a character that would somehow change the narrative, it would be done through sex. This should only be used a few times and was really only effective for me with Hanabi and Sanae. The fact that this method was used as the only way to change the plot made it seem more like fanservice than development.\\n\\n\r\nThe constant near hentai on my screen I can ignore. It\u2019s how contrived the story became in a short amount of time that I couldn\u2019t. I genuinely liked Sanae\u2019s character and role at first. She was innocent but didn\u2019t act like a child. She liked Hanabi, but for believable reasons. The fact that it was yuri was just an added bonus. The fact that she was a girl had surprised me and I\u2019m disappointed to say that it didn\u2019t really matter in the end. The producers could have used her gender to really push Hanabi to new limits. I really wanted to see her question any potential feelings that she felt for Sanae since she too was a girl.\\n\\n\r\nSanae is the only character besides Hanabi whom I liked in the beginning, but I\u2019ll address that later. Once Noriko was introduced, I started to see this show\u2019s downward spiral coming into effect. I had started to get annoyed as more nonsensical drama was added due to Akane and I was very disappointed with the ending. In a sense, I can\u2019t blame them. By the 7th episode, I asked \u201cHow on Earth can they possibly end this show?\u201d . At this point, the ending was so meaningless that I actually don\u2019t remember it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really angered me in Kuzu no Honkai was the unnecessary number of side plots. You can only add so many side stories until you stop caring about the others. Some didn\u2019t even change anything in the plot nor characters. I\u2019m certain some were only there to fill in episodes. During these side plots, the personalities that we\u2019ve established in our cast are thrown out of the window. They become completely out of character : Hanabi is a stupid, crying, and submissive girl. Sanae is suddenly a sex goddess. Noriko suddenlys tries to flaunt herself. Mugi goes from liking older women to girls who basically look like fifth graders, and Akane becomes a blushing schoolgirl? What\u2019s worse is that the producers try to justify these changes with monologues of the characters while they have sex. It\u2019s hard enough to pay attention when there are naked girls on the screen, but their inner thoughts seem pointless anyway seeing that after the episode finishes, THE CHARACTER HAS THE SAME PERSONALITY AS THE EPISODE BEFORE IT. As more and more irrelevant characters were added, Kuzu no Honkai got dumber and dumber.I am very serious when I say I don\u2019t remember anything that happened in the twelfth episode. I think that really says something.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI can\u2019t really complain in the art department. I adore the lineart brush they used and thought their more detailed and painted pictures were lovely. I\u2019m glad they kept a consistent washed-out pastel look to everything as well.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I can say that there is one thing I couldn\u2019t stand. I started this show around its fourth episode. Now, if I don\u2019t know much about a show beforehand, I decide if I should watch it from the studio, but mainly the cover art. I can easily say that I hated the cover art for Kuzu no Honkai. Not only are the characters literally just standing there, but the background is just a single color that basically looks like white. This really is just a nitpick, but it\u2019s bothered me for a while now.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe only reason that I gave the sound is due to the fact that I liked the opening and ending, but I can\u2019t remember any music used in the actual show. This basically means it didn\u2019t make an impact on me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nCharacters are what make or break a show. In this case, they demolished this show. Like I said earlier, the characters randomly change entirely for the sake of stupid side plots. But I feel as if it\u2019s important for me to really tear these characters apart.\\n\\n\r\nHanabi:\\n\r\nI loved Hanabi at first. She was witty, had a realistic personality, and she was honestly pretty cute. Even while she was with one of Akane\u2019s men, at least her thoughts stayed true to her personality. (Although she acted totally against it.) Hanabi\u2019s personality was kind of believable at first. I really liked how she\u2019d see something and basically think \u201cwhat the fuck?\u201d Even so, throughout the show, the personality that I loved to see got masked by her crying over her lesbian side chick or the older teacher dude. She was toyed around by her misconception of love and became another dumb romance protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nMugi:\\n\r\nMugi was\u2026 strange. There was no development in him that I can recall. He screwed around with his annoying princess loli, played around with teacher, and slept with Hanabi. The only time he felt like a person was when Hanabi would tease him and he would actually react. In my eyes at least, there is no rationale for Mugi falling for his tutor and teacher. While the first two sex scenes between Akane and Mugi actually pushed the plot a bit, that\u2019s really all they needed. Their relationship went on way longer than it should have. Mugi in the end left virtually no impact on me and I really don\u2019t remember him too well.\\n\\n\r\nSanae:\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, I liked Sanae in the beginning of the show. However, I really didn\u2019t think she\u2019d start to force herself on Hanabi. Especially since how they met after Hanabi had caught a man groping her on a crowded train. After their sex scene, I didn\u2019t even know how to describe Sanae anymore. During their scene, she wasn\u2019t flustered in the slightest. In fact, she acted like they\u2019d done it before. For the rest of the show, she became this more sexually blatant and dominant character. The show already has enough of these. Her and Hanabi\u2019s relationship became pointless once they took a vacation together.\\n\\n\r\nNoriko :\\n\r\nI hate Noriko. I hate her so much. She is so irrelevant and annoying. Her design, her voice, her stupid crush. It\u2019s all annoying. That\u2019s all I have to say on her.\\n\\n\r\nAkane:\\n\r\nAkane was a very dumb character. It was clear that the producers didn\u2019t even know themselves why she was screwing every living thing with a penis. She was very overdone and even through her \u201credemption\u201d I couldn\u2019t even tolerate her.\\n\\n\r\nNarumi:\\n\r\nlol this man is annoying. He acted like a middle schooler trying to ask out a 12 year old. All in all, he didn\u2019t even feel like an adult.\\n\\n\r\nAtsuya:\\n\r\nWho??\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nMy favorite kind of show involves seeing the mental deterioration of characters. I\u2019ve never seen a show mess up that aspect like Kuzu no Honkai. The side plots are really what made me start to dislike this show in the end. Not to mention Mugi and Hanabi didn\u2019t even have a budding romance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai had a lot of potential with it\u2019s different approach to the romance genre. It\u2019s clear that they took this potential, chewed it up, and threw it on the side of road. I really expected something great from this show, but it was all a shit show in disguise.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Basically, this is the anime where all of the characters pretty much do everything you don't want them to do. Watch it if you want a sad anime where terrible people do terrible things. I feel like that's where the author wanted to take this story, so I didn't rate it based on all the terrible things that happened. They're there on purpose, so don't expect to like the characters in this anime.\r\nThe first episode really gets you hooked but then you start to wonder how far you can take the concept in a full-length anime. That results to a very drawled out story thatgoes on for 12 episodes.\\n\r\nThat being said, I still actually enjoyed watching it because the main protagonists were interesting in the first half of the run and the first half was also where most of the revelations were coming out. However, it does become evident that there's really nothing more to any of them (for the most part) after the first half. In the second half it becomes clearer that the story and the characters have no clear focus or goal.\\n\\n\r\nSure, they get the important character development at the end during the last 2 episodes, but you can easily gloss over episodes 7-11. I ended up scrubbing through the parts that didn't have Mugi or Hanabi in them because they felt redundant.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story and the characters fell short, I wanted to finish the series because I wanted to see how the protagonists would develop. I didn't get the ending I wanted, but I did understand what the two mains felt when they decided to do what they did in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's the kind of anime I'd watch when I had the time or the boredom, but not if I was hoping to add another title to one of my favorites.",

As someone who honestly enjoyed both works, I fail to see their connection except maybe they both appeal to a certain type of people such as myself. This is not a review of School days so I will stop ranting that here. \r\nKuzu no Honkai is aimed to make you feel sympathetic toward people who do things that you do not approve of. My opinion of bitch sensei changed very dramatically after each of her internal monologues.  This doesn't mean that I like her or approve of any of her actions, it just means that Ican find some truth in her bullshit and feel slightly sorry for her. Her world view is interesting and correct to a certain degree. She is much more relatable than the oniichan. People who call oniichan a cuck is a little too harsh but he just seems too nice to be real. \\n\r\nThe finding true love ending for Hanabi and mugi is a little too much for me, but I guess I will pretend love exist and accept the ending. Mugi's actions are the result of his penis though he does use his brain while his penis is guiding his body. \\n\r\nIt is really fun to use the monologue to try and like the character then get completely shit on emotionally when they justify their illogical action with something that makes sense. If you just hate everyone then the story get a lot more boring. Try to understand why shitty people do shitty things and see how the shitty logic actually make some sense. Illogical yes but not completely illogical. Shitty yes but not worthless.\\n\r\nInternal monologue + senseless makeout/sex scenes is actually a really nice combination. Glad this is not one of those bullshit where holding hand is lewd or something. \\n\r\nI wish they went for a full sad ending instead of one where everyone is at least content and some what hopeful.",

            "content": "RANT:Love is so overated, I don't get it.People go to such lengths,even committing suicides and murders, to fall in love with someone.Whats the point?Falling in love with someone means taking responsibility for someone, sacrificing privacy, and having to deal with the problems that erupt from your lover.Not to mention spending time that you need to yourself to focus on your lover all the time..I kinda get why you should be with someone when you're grown and alone. But I don't get why it's such a \"popular thing to do in high school\".The relationships that take place at my high school are just melodramatic.Some one usualdates someone else and it's not platonic whatsoever.And when some girl starts to cry in the middle of class or a guy gets annoyed , I want to have sympathy for them but I just can't help but say\"Well that's what you get for choosing to be together\".I think that if high school kids want to be in a relationship they should heed the warning of the consequences that comes from it.That way they don't have to make a break up such a big deal.Not to say that \"big deal\" is \\n\r\n not entertaining to watch.  This being the case with Kuzu no Honkai or Scum's Wish.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo explain the story better, I'm going to have to use an analogy.There is, 1,2,3,4,5,6,and,7.\\n\r\n1 is in love with 2,but 2 is actually in love with 3.4 has a crush on 3 too, but doesn't have a chance since 2 is a better choice.So 1 and 4 solemnly look at the relationship between 2 and 3 knowing they don't have a chance, decide to hook up with each other but don't love each other.There is also 5 and 6 who have crushes on 1 and 4, and 7 who has a possible crush on 6 ,but is turned down because 6 is a lesbian.And now we have not just a love triangle or box, but a LOVE HEXAGON\\n\r\nHere's the more simpler way of putting it:Have you seen Toradora?(If you haven't,you should because I highly recommend it)Well, the story of Toradora comes from the relationships made with the wrong people.But in this case, the elements of the Nether realm decided to replicate into the form of that show.And now, I officially  brand the show with the title of \"Toradora FROM HELL\".The story goes through the eyes of 1 and 4(Hanabi and Mugi) and their everlasting hopeless chance of being with their crushes because they're not as compatible as their crushes,2 and 3(Narumi and Akane), are together.Lets get one thing out of the way.This show is very maturein the sexual aspect.A lot of very uncomfortable sex scenes take place that adds to the uneasiness of this show.And it not seductive for the sake of being seductive.It's seductive because it's sensitive.This is evident from the themes presented in the show from promiscuity and impureness to rejection and acceptance.And there are some touching moments.Other times, it just feels like the show is tryng to go somewhere but doesn't really go anywhere.This is where the supporting characters come into play and they have their own problems as well and after that .. nothing else.This is going to sound a bit wry, but I feel like the show should've been a bit more uncensored to fully hit on the sensitivity this show provides.I mean there are some really really really really involved kissing scenes that looks pulled straight from a hentai. Elfen Lied had exposed nudity(with little girls i might add) and it really did not fit in with the gore and blood of the show.This show would've hit home as a hentai, but as an anime, it does fairly well.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was done by Lerche, a studio that more times than not have average animation.The same thing goes for this show.There isn't any remarkable scenes but there isn't any atrociously looking scenes as well.The animation improves by only a hair during the sexual scenes But what makes Kuzu no Honkai special from the rest is their style. Changing scenes into black and white,changing the screen ratio, and even adjusting the lighting to make everything dark.Also the imagery in the opening and ending are well done.The opening has many symbols used like the door that appears and one of the minor characters,Noriko, seen with wings.And the ending is a kaleidoscopic regurgitation of colors in a very disarrayed fashion.I also like how the lighting is very dark and dim during the sexual scenes that happen to make them seem very obscure like a sin that everyone does.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of the show is like someone took the peppy electronic beats of a slice of life show and made it more serious.The soundtrack is very dramatic and tense. When it is being played during the sex scenes, I just couldn't help but feel guilty for some reason.I felt like I was about to go to jail or something.The opening and ending songs remind me of those very depressing vocaloid songs on youtube.The visuals really help with that comparison.It's one of those songs where it sounds catchy but the tone is not a happy one and when you look at the actual lyrics their actually very depressing.Both vocalists do a really good job too.Also the acting in the show is incredible.They really pull off the emotion, either it being an emotional moment, or a sexual one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Kuzu no Honkai are very mixed. Hanabi was the main character I felt bad for because she couldn't be with the one she loves,but around the middle of the show, envy takes her over and she does stupid things.What is redeeming about this is that she realizes how stupid her decisions were and takes a break and decides to get some FRIENDS.Mugi was just a first impression gone wrong.I thought he would be the one who would make the relationship between him and Hanabi to be abusive and crappy. But he actually is not that bad of a person.He comforts Hanabi and does the best he can but like Hanabi, he also does stupid things.But I had to give him sympathy because he was aware at the fact that he would never be with Akane.Speaking of Akane, she deserves mention.When her actual thoughts on being with Narumi,I thought she was the worst character ever.But at the end of the series, she is insightful on the fact that she is an absolute bitch.When was the last time i've seen something like that in anime? I can't even remember .Sanae is the girl in love with Hanabi but knows she won't be with her and accepts it. She contributes not only for Hanabi to question her own feelings but also to the sex scenes between her and Hanabi. Yes , it happens more than once.Surprisingly they focus on Sanae a bit more than Hanabi's actually crush,Narumi. I can't really fault Narumi for his crush towards Akane because it happens.But what I wanted to see is Narumi's actual feelings towards Habani besides being just a \"little-sister\".I mean, being siblings in the anime world doesn't really stop anyone.And last but not least is Noriko.Despite being in the opening, she is in the show for one and a half episodes.She has a childlike demeanor and the voice to boot.She was an important character though because she pictures herself as the pure and dainty princess and when she's with Mugi, she conflicts between her purity and her wanting to bang Mugi.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis romance to me stands out because it takes a different turn in romance.\\n\r\nWhen you think of romance in the anime genre, you don't really think of this because it's so different.\\n\r\nBut this show is still a romance.If you like a rom-dramedy. This is not really for you.This show has humor but it stands out from the seriousness of the rest of the show.I get it though. Without the comedy this show would just be very depressing from start to end.As a romance, this show is good.But what makes it very good is the themes presented,the turn it takes,and the ending that teaches a lesson that there are plenty of fish in the sea.\\n\r\nOverall-8\\n\r\nI'm surprised that no one ended up with an STD after all the promiscuity in the show.\\n\r\nStay abstinent, kids.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Whew. That was a breath of fresh air. I haven't seen something as astonishing and fascinating for quite a long time and this seriously should deserve more praise. At first, I didn\u2019t have the motivation to watch this series. Still, I am very glad that I watched this series.\r\nBefore we start, there are a few points you need to pay attention to if you haven\u2019t watch the anime:\r\n-This is not your typical romance anime. So, if you only like romance anime for the happy endings or main characters that are good in terms of personality, go and watch something else like Toradora (one of myfavourite)\\n\r\n-The story itself involves in more mature content (in terms of psychological ways), which means it is a lot more complicated than normal romance anime series. If you like straightforward romance anime, this anime may not interest you.\\n\\n\r\nStory / Plot: Let me just skip the summary of the story as a lot of reviews have included those already. The story itself is unique when you compare it with typical romance anime. The plot itself generally have no clich\u00e9 you can find in typical romance anime. It is not about a boy needing to choose his girlfriend from a bunch of girls and there is not a definite good ending. Of course, this anime ended in a rather good way consider the worst case it could have been, but still the ending is not like 'happily ever after' type of ending. I have no idea how did the author arranged the story in the manga, but still I loved the way the anime tell the story. They don't exactly tell you what event causes this to happen or what so ever. They do it so that the flow of the story can catch all our attention. The story can bring out the \u2018dark side\u2019 or rather realistic romantic situations that we may encounter (probably not for me though). The author has opened new possibilities to the world of romance anime/ manga. I know that some people may feel uncomfortable because of how the characters handle their feelings, but at the same time this is another unique point of this series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This contributed so much to the whole anime. Believe it or not, all the characters in this anime are as the title said, they are trash (kuzu). They are trash in terms of the ways they choose to handle different situations and incidents involving their romantic feelings and sexual desires. Please don\u2019t misunderstand what I am trying to say here \u2013 all the characters are designed perfectly. Their \u2018trashy\u2019 personalities move on with the plot so well and as the story progresses, you can see how their personality and thoughts changes and mature into a better one. Their \u2018trashy\u2019 personalities can be found commonly in all human beings (including me). Looking how all the characters turning into better human beings somehow contributes to why I like this anime so much. All the characters made a lot of mistakes in the anime, but still in the end they actually do reflect what they did wrong and tries to improve themselves. There are no definite \u2018protagonist\u2019 in this story, and this is another thing I like about this series. For the voices of each character, all the voice actors have done an amazing job and their voices enhanced the whole anime series to the next level.\\n\\n\r\nArt: One word: Superb. I loved all the characters\u2019 eyes. Their eyes are beautifully animated. Besides all the nicely drawn characters and those borderline animated mature scenes, the backgrounds are well drawn. One of my favourite backgrounds is the scene where Hanabi and Ebato when to Karuizawa. The sky full of stars and the forest was magnificent.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Both OP and ED are awesome. Awesome vocals from 96neko for the OP Uso no hibana ad Sayuri for the ED Heikousen. I suggest you to search up the lyrics (especially for the OP) because the lyrics can clearly describe the things happening in the anime and it has a lot of meanings. For the background music, everything fits in the situation and the mood. The music was nicely done and it fits in the anime perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: This series is very very refreshing, given that I have watched quite a lot of romance anime (I am not saying the others are bad, there are still a lot of good ones), mainly because of its unique story and \u2018trashy\u2019 characters. This is one superb series with beautiful animations and awesome voices from the professional voice actors. Certainly, I enjoyed it a lot when I was watching this series. If you want a mature themed romance anime with deep plot, this is the right one to go for.",

            "content": "I don't normally write reviews, but I noticed that this show was pretty controversial in comments/review sections, so I figured I throw my opinion into the ring as well.\r\nA quick summary: Kuzu no Honkai (Scum's Wish) follows high schooler Yasuraoka Hanabi and her love for her teacher who has been somewhat of a brother figure to her since childhood, Kanai Narumi. From the start, it's clear that her affections are unrequited, and to make up for the loneliness she feels, she gets together with Awaya Mugi, a guy in her grade who is also hopelessly in love with a teacher, Minagawa Akane. Although they don'thave feelings for each other, they have a strangely sexual relationship with little communication involved. The story, from the start, is somewhat depressing and treated maturely, which seems odd for a show about teenagers. I also found the age gaps a little bit weird, but then again, this is Japan, so I can't say I'm that surprised. Honestly, the plot just felt iffy to me, considering the tone and disturbing premise of the show.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my early qualms with story, I still found myself hooked from the first episode. The show is beautifully animated and the soundtrack was one of the best aspects (especially the ending song by Sayuri-- though I might be a little biased.) However, what I really fell in love with was the characters and character development. \\n\\n\r\nTo start, there's the main character, Hanabi. She's somewhat of a loner and doesn't have many friends (other than one girl, Ecchan) and many admirers. She also has a very pessimistic and mature view of the world, and despite the fact that she says that she's fine with being alone, it's clear that she struggles with her loneliness. To be all honest, I don't normally like overly deep characters like herself, but Hanabi keeps things real with her occasional blunt comments/thoughts and her self awareness. I found her problems to be somewhat relatable as well in spite of the weirdness of the plot, and much of it was due to conflict between autonomy and dependence on others which grew muddled to her a few episodes into the show. Her behaviors definitely break a lot of social norms and moral code, but I think that her reasoning for them is surprisingly understandable. Although she struggles with various drama throughout the show, she views herself and her problems as pathetic, and seems to realize that her actions aren't really right. This is what fuels her character development, along with her desire for independence. Hanabi starts off in the show as relatively independent, though a little insecure, but this takes a quick turn when her relationship with Mugi begins. Soon, and also partially caused by provocation from Akane, she starts to rely on the affections of others to feel good about herself. This continues for most of the rising action in the series, but, after a series of events, Hanabi realizes that she's becoming dependent and strives to feel comfortable alone again. Her development was definitely what I found most interesting about the show and kept the plot moving for me.\\n\\n\r\nIn comparison, the male protagonist, Mugi, seemed to move in a very different direction from Hanabi. Although both started out in the same boat, while Hanabi strove to regain her independence, Mugi started to lose hold of his through his odd relationship with Akane. I originally liked Mugi as much if not more than Hanabi, but this regression into dependence kind of ruined my opinion of him. However, he did redeem himself at the end in my eyes, as did many of the other characters that I originally disliked but began to appreciate. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Kuzu no Honkai is definitely understandably controversial due to the strange approach to a teenage romance and the questionable morals that were introduced through the main characters' relationship. However, in spite of this, I found it to be enjoyable mainly due to the dynamic characters and their development, as well as the extremely well done art and soundtrack.",

            "content": "I spoke too early about this anime. And now? You could say that my opinions have changed after watching, but it wasn't enough for me to say that \"I shouldn't judge a book by the cover\". I finished the whole thing and I do believe the story is something new and great, however what's been bugging me is the technical points of the anime.\r\nLet me emphasize my comments with my review. There might be some spoilers. Teehee\r\nStory 9/10\r\nThis is something fresh, I can't say it's a nice kind of fresh but it is something to inspire authors with so that we don't get a repetitionof romcoms and \"love triangles\" kind-of-stories. It is something new, a unique tackle on romance about love and it's more \"unloving\" side.\\n\\n\r\nIt really was great for me, because alongside Akane's m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois, is the development of each character from their \"scummy\" state to something more normal. The story is not entirely lacking, everything was almost keen and neat. You have your backstory here, conflict here, plothole there etc etc.. it was basically complete (not to mention the tons of fanservice provided)\\n\\n\r\nHowever I do believe the story is somewhat pretentious, it couldn't get by without sinking another scene of straight or lesbian fuckenings, it seemed that the anime was trying too hard to get the viewers to stay. Also some scenes could've been better. Overall for the story, it was truly something new and delivered unto the end with great expectations, but the first few episodes were indeed terrible.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\r\nThe art is something I take issue with. I mean, is the animator having a bad day or something?\\n\\n\r\nFirst off why do they look so mechanical? Their movements where really anti-dynamic, its as if every part of them is being controlled by a puppet. A lot of stuff could've been better, even the panning of the shots was mediocrity at its finest, I would've expected something better since the studio animating this actually worked on \"Danganrompa\". \\n\\n\r\nFrom the walking, to the timing of the dialogues. Some parts where somewhat fine but the rest was just so pathetic. Well for me, the whole thing is pathetic. Character design is what I'd expect it to be, and I did expect nice character designs based on the cover; it met with my hopes and for me that's what's important.\\n\\n\r\nThe background was great and from the leaves falling scenes to the tears falling parts, those parts of this anime were somewhat at an acceptable rate, but the animation was not something I can really get my mind out of, it really wasn't good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nThe sound was fine to be honest. If I were to emphasize it.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP was quite nice, the lyrics were fitting on to the whole thing and as for the ED, I could say the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM was just being BGM, for me it wasn't something to be commended but it also wasn't something that was terrible.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nFresh, fresh as Hanabi's flower. *high-fives itself*\\n\\n\r\nThey were renditioned versions of some generic characters (i.e the slutty teacher, the curious protagonist, the corrupted and misguided protagonist, the friend that likes the MC but not liked back, the character that likes the friend that likes MC but not like her back etc...)This is something I really don't mind to be honest, every character that flows right with the story is an interesting character itself, but this one is just really weird since the teacher just keeps fucking around (literally) and the misguided protagonist was really misguided. Everything went to plan I guess?\\n\\n\r\nBut why \"7\"? Why \"fresh\"?\\n\r\nJust as I've said, they are renditioned versions of generic characters, they still have that same taste of old-school mannerisms, except on this story we got to see their sides and persepectives as a whole. Like how did the teacher become such a slut, what happened behind the scenes of our protagonists? Etc.. etc..\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nI did enjoy it, but I didn't quite appreciate it.\\n\\n\r\nGood stories likes these basically takes place in my heart, And fresh stories like these turns into inspirations in my mind for future references when making a story. But this one didn't sink it on my heart, it was a feast for references though.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't a good experience on the first half, and for me the first half is basically the dead zone for watching anime, it's the \"impress or depress\" point of a story, and in this anime, it wasn't even in the fucking choices.\\n\\n\r\nI hated the first half with a passion, it was weird and very unsettling, it threw a lot of uncalled details on to me as a viewer and it just shoved drama and conflict in a very abrupt way. The storytelling was all over the place and at the same time lined up in front of you. And the constant sex scenes of (insert main character here) got to be quite annoying, and at the same time very, very, interesting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai is great indeed, but as I've said the main issue that I have is more on the anime's technical points. It could've been much more better if the animations were somewhat more lively, and the dialogues where more precisely timed with their mouths.\\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn't need more work, and has little room for improvement considering how new the concept actually is. The art really could've done a lot more better. So much more better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it? Yes, I would, only if the person is actually looking for something raw and quite bold for an anime.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it?\\n\r\n Depends on you entirely, if I were you I'd definitely watch it, the story delivers quite well from the beginning to the end.\\n\\n\r\nIt also has an awful lot of \"fanservice\" too.

Noitamina, an animation block in Japan that focuses on making experimental anime shows, has a tendency to do this. Sometimes it works(oftentimes it works) and sometimes it feels like a gimmick that they rely on to expand the plot. Scum's Wish is the latter, the subject matter of Scum's Wish probably could have been explored to the same extent without all the scenes of kissing and genital touching. But, even with that flaw it is still superb. What this showmanages to do is recreate the brilliance of shows like Hyouka and Flowers of Evil. The aforementioned anime work primarily because they bring the interpersonal connections to the forefront.  The characters develop these really compelling relationships that develop over the course of the show, and all throughout there is this overwhelming somberness. A somberness born from these characters spinning their wheels and ultimately getting nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nWhenever a show can physically get me to cringe, there is a problem. I want to be emotionally drawn in by a show - not repulsed. 9/10 times the emotional conflict of this show felt natural and fun. Scum's Wish commits the cardinal sin of having two characters getting into shout-matches without the proper character development. It is ALWAYS a bad idea to make a major plot point of an anime revolve around a side character that has little, to no, screentime.\\n\\n\r\nScum's Wish is not that deep. It is a fun, somber, thematically rich story that has too many sex scenes, just for the sake of sex scenes.",

The main characters, Yasuraoka Hanabi and Awaya Mugi, are two youngsters whose idealized dream partners (an older neighbor and a teacher, respectively) seem not even aware of their feelings, making them turn to what seems like their best option: Getting into a physical relationship to help themselves cope with their self-loathing and untended to desire.\r\n   Now, withthe uneventful objective fact torrent over with, we can cover some real ground. This series reminds me an awful lot of Space Patrol Luluco in its themes, even if exectution is far removed from the over-the-top, poppy style so easily associated with Trigger as a studio. In fact, it extrapolates the concept into the exact opposite way, and aims for a more grounded approach, even if the feelings presented still hit the same notes. Both series are about how, in the long run, a teenager's feelings and problems will change completely and are unimportant to their lives at large, but matter like no else to them.\\n\\n\\n\r\n   The use of sex scenes is quite a far cry from what you'd usually see in romance shows; whereas normally they would be taken as an opportunity for fanservice, Kuzu no Honkai turns them into a sickening display of the desperation of the characters for any human contact at all, and it gets across the vitriolic nature of the main characters' relationship.\\n\\n\\n\r\n   All in all, while not a perfect show in any measure, it does much with its directing and themes to warrant some attention, and the way it frames the ephemeral nature of youth is captivating, to say the least.",

            "content": "So this is my first review I've ever done so I hope it goes down well. Scums wish is an anime about how everyone is empty and is trying to fill themselves with something to feel whole, no matter how shallow or superficial it is. \r\nStory: 8 \r\nBe warned this show is the definition of mellow drama so if you don't like that, then abort now. A good comparison is to the second season of SNAFU with much of the plot being in their head and the rest of it are the characters trying to convey it. Oh wait there's one more part. Sex. Yathat happens quite a bit of that, albeit it has a purpose and is handled maturely, but at the same time, they still show enough that you can get your dick hard to it, but if that's your goal in the first place, then just go watch some hentai or something. Okay, back to the topic at hand, the characters go through some of the best arcs I've seen in anime, and the arcs are all being done in cohesion, only possible with the impeccable pacing this show has. The reason I can't give this a perfect ten though is because while the story is nice, it's very predictable and can get slow at times.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7 \\n\\n\r\nso, a lot of people are saying that this is one of the best looking shows they've seen, and while I cant say that this show is ugly to look at, the shows is just barely better than average to look at. While other shows with this quality of art usually compensate that with amazing animation or breathtaking backgrounds, this show doesn't really have any of that. Besides that, I also found most of the character designs pretty bland and unoriginal, with the exception being hanabi kind of looked cute but that is only personal bias since I like girls with that hairstyle (but then again, that's pretty dumb to say, being all reviews are biased). While I have been bashing the art of this show, by no means is it bad. The color pallet they use for this invokes a strong sense of nostalgia and if you were to judge a shows art just solely based on the characters eyes this show would get an 11/10 from me. Besides what I mentioned before, I feel like this show doesn't fully utilize the fact that this show is an anime to the fullest. While they do convey the feelings through facial emotions well and there is a lot of symbolism in this show, which you might find interesting if your into picking apart every detail of a show, this show just simply could of utilized the use of animation more to either help solidify what the characters are saying or just simply cutting out some of the words and replacing it with animation. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\\n\r\nThis so far has the best ED song I've heard this season and while the OP initially just sounded like generic anime OP music ( which isn't bad in my opinion, just sort of forgettable), over time the song sort of grew on me and became next level anime OP shit. Besides that, a big reason why this show worked for me was the stunning voice acting, especially Anzai Chika who voices Hanabi. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 \\n\\n\r\nSo this is the part of the show that either makes it or breaks it for most people. If you can't get invested in at least some of the characters, then you will most likely not like this show, and to be honest, this show doesn't do a good job of making these characters interesting. These viewer isn't given any information about these characters except what is needed to know what's happening in the story and throughout the show, hey don\u2019t really add anything to these characters to make it believable that they have a life out of this show. If you are able to overcome this hurdle though, you'll find deep character who are all scum, as the name implies, because of how they're afraid to show their true feelings are willing to make other people hurt just to try and make themselves feel whole. They are trying to find what is making them feel empty and how they explore themselves to fill that gap and all the mistakes they make among the way. Even Akane, who most would find unlikable when they initially find out her true nature, becomes a character who you want to sympathize with once you understand her better. Besides two characters, who don\u2019t even make a difference or appear much, I found all the characters interesting at one point or another.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9  \\n\\n\r\nIn short, yes I found a lot of enjoyment out of this show. Because of how I found most of the characters interesting and endearing, there was never a point that I was extremely bored ( but there were sometimes I was close to that), and due to some experiences I've had that dealt with the same themes this story dealt with, It was extremely relatable and heart warming.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8  \\n\\n\r\nDue to everything I've said prior to this, both the good and the bad I gotta give this an 8. I know not everyone is into these slow paced shows with a lot of mellow drama. But overall, it was very solid and while I might not watch it again, I certainly won't forget this and how it made me feel. If I were to describe the feeling it gave me. It's sort of like sitting under a large tree, waiting for a heavy rain to end, and while it takes some time to end, when it does, a ray of sunlight beams down and makes you feel warm inside.",

            "content": "Being someone that loves romance anime, \"Kuzu no Honkai\", or better known as \"Scum's Wish\" hit me with many unexpected emotions that developed into a deep interest for how and why the characters, sound, and story are portrayed as they are.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nAs you've probably read in these other reviews, \"Kuzu no Honkai\" is not your typical romance anime. It mostly refrains from the warm parts of falling in love and sticks with the darker and more painful aspects. \"Kuzu no Honkai\" is able to tell  a story of the pains and faults of love and is crafted in a way that lets the viewerconnect with the characters as the characters are portrayed as much more \"realistic\". It's able to creatively lead the viewer to think about the nature of people and how their happiness can cause a tremendous amount of pain to another. Saying that this anime is \"thought provoking and mature\" is true, but, I feel that is a very vague statement to make as this anime requires much more thought and personal thinking to develop how an individual connects to the story. Overall, the story peaked my interests consistently with a few slow moments here and there mainly for comic relief and was able to keep me engaged in the story and craving more.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nPersonally, I really liked the art in this anime. I liked how the characters were drawn, I liked how the backgrounds were drawn, I liked how the OT/ED were done, etc. From more of a non-biased view, I felt the art was good, but not outstanding. The way that shadows and light were used particularly caught my eye as it created more of an atmosphere in a scene or around a specific character that brought out more of their personality. Refraining from using bright, vibrant colors establish a much more relaxed and monotone feeling which allows the viewer to focus more on the story aspect of the anime. To sum it up, I personally really liked the art, but don't go in expecting something like \"5 Centimeters Per Second\".\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, I don't feel there is much to really say. Sad scenes have sad music, happy scenes have happy music. The voice acting I thought was good as well but I feel that the power of the sound lies in this anime's ED. \"Heikousen\" took my breath away the first time that I heard it. With the art in the ED, this song is able to drive the meaning and feelings of this anime. Overall the sound slightly above average aside from the ED which was outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 or 10/10\\n\r\nCharacters. Where should I even begin. The characters in this anime were like actual people for lack of better words. Unlike many other romance anime, \"Kuzu no Honkai\" not only shows some of the good parts of love, but the painful parts as well which are beautifully integrated into its characters providing an emotional experience for the viewer. Seeing as there are many different \"types\" of characters, odds are that there is at least one that the viewer can more or less easily connect with. The only issue I have with the characters is that it does take time for them to develop and see their true colors which I guess is only natural.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI loved this anime. I'm always looking for a new romance anime to watch as I just tend to really like them but \"Kuzu no Honkai\" in particular stands out to me as one of my favorites. Maybe it was just that it was a change of pace from your typical romance anime which interested me, but I truly thought that this anime was an amazing work. From a broader point of view, It's not a masterpiece nor is it just \"good\". It brought out the love, hatred, sadness, etc. in me while watching it which doesn't occur very often (for me at least). I don't think this would be the anime for someone new to anime to start off with, but for a more seasoned viewer, I feel that \"Kuzu no Honkai\" has a lot to offer the viewer and, if able to appreciate what it does offer, it can show up and blow the viewer away.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nTo sum all of this up, I loved \"Kuzu no Honkai\". It brought forward a plethora of emotions which may seem a bit formidable and complicated at first, but beautifully wove them together into an anime that I wont be forgetting about anytime soon. The hidden messages and motifs hidden throughout the anime just add to the complexity(?) and creativeness of this anime. Of course it has it's flaws, but, \"Kuzu no Honkai\" left me shocked and yearning for more. This is definitely an anime that I'd more than gladly re watch as I feel that there are still details that I may have missed. For anyone interested in romance/\"feelsy\" anime, \"Kuzu no Honkai\" is definitely for you as it brings out a new side to the genre that I have never seen before.",

            "content": "Love is a fickle thing.  Almost if not everyone yearns for true love, to find that one person who loves them unconditionally and through thick and thin, will stay with them no matter what hardships may come.  But life isn't as easy as that.  But in reality, something as simple as loving someone is...complicated, full of heartbreaks and unexpected turns that almost never have a happy ending.\r\nStory:  With a title that's translated to \"Scum's Wish\", Kuzu no Honkai plays out the tale of a pair of high school hopefuls who get together for the sake of fulfilling each other's fantasies ofembracing and loving their respective interest in hopes that one day, they will be able to actually hold the one that they love and not use a surrogate to satiate their desires.\\n\\n\r\nLove and lust are two words that intertwine in meaning.  With the entirety of its screentime (save for the odd comedic moment here and there) devoted to the varying relationships with its characters, Kuzu no Honkai plays as a downward spiral into each character's lives with themes of love, lust, betrayal, desire, sex, and tragedy as the forefront of its story.  Each character brings their own spin on the tale of true love and what it is that they want.  As a result, the show brings about a kind of complexity that, while has varying results depending on the character, has a realistic feel compared to the idealistic happily ever after that we see with most romance series.\\n\\n\r\nEach passing episode brings the viewer and its characters further and further down the rabbit hole, as more and more issues arise between its characters, and the more unsatisfactory parts of human nature rear their ugly heads.  The main issue I see with the show is how suffocating it felt due to how strong the show's scent of betrayal and scumminess became.  The escalation with each episode felt less impactful with every step down into the abyss the show made.  While watching, I never expected a positive return of redemption for anyone, but it became apparent that I was expecting something worse going to happen in the next episode, thus creating an oddly predictable pattern for a supposedly unpredictable plotline.  \\n\\n\r\nI find those that aren't Mugi, Hanabi, or their respective love interests to have less than stellar stories to them, mostly because they're a part of the story only to try and add a little more 'depth' to the whole debacle.  I feel as though the show could've used without them and saved the screentime for other things since their character and development have only a slight amount of impact to the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Kuzu no Honkai is an intentional story about the detestable aspects of human nature.  While extreme to a fault, causing a lot of its shock and interest to lose its value in the later episodes, Kuzu no Honkai gives us a more realistic spin on the tale of finding love.  None of the endings are happy, every character endures some form of pain and suffering, and the only thing you can really say to it all is \"Such is life.\"  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Consistent themes and storytelling\\n\r\n+ Realistic spin on romance\\n\r\n-  Too heavy handed with how it wanted to play itself out\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Kuzu no Honkai has a cast of characters with unredeemable qualities.  Fitting with the scummy and detestable nature of the story, what we see is a group of people slowly unfurl their facades and show us (sometimes quite blatantly) what they truly desire.\\n\\n\r\nEach character gets their own spotlight due to the cast's small size, allowing each of their stories to be fleshed out with varying sizes depending on who is at the show's focus.  As standalone characters, almost no one is able to stand on their own two feet.  Each character stands as a trait or a piece of the whole puzzle as both Hanabi and Mugi, our two main characters, act as the centerpieces to the interconnecting web of character relationships that exist at the heart of this show.  As such, they're shallow when alone, but deep and meaningful when together.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile yes, most if not every character is meant to be literal human trash, the difficulty from this fact arises when it comes to discerning whether or not the characters are meant to be symbols or characters.  We have Akane, who poses as an innocent gal hiding behind a mask, Moca, the young girl who yearns to find her prince, and Sanae, who seems to be consumed by her desire to be with who she likes.  They all have a story to tell, but they all feel so engrossed in their own themes and flaws that it's hard to see them beyond different ideas clashing against one another when the characters come in contact with each other.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Complex character relationships\\n\r\n-  Standalone, characters don't have much about themselves\\n\r\n-  Characters feel like symbols more than anything else\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Lerche, Kuzu no Honkai has a very light yet expressive artstyle that gives the show an artistic look to the whole thing.  Its light color palette and artstyle gives way to a great many forms of visual storytelling and metaphors that are used constantly to drive home the different internal turmoils and internal monologues that each character has in order to drive home the point of what their story entails.  Not only that, but the show has beautiful portrait stills in a few key moments in the series, thus giving the show some very picturesque moments that capture the moment of a character in mixed emotion.  These moments are few in number, but each is memorable and beautiful in their own right.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the show provides us with quite a number of scenes of intimacy, as the show uses a variety of camera angles and closeups while painting the scene of what is happening without being too explicit with it.  Yes, the characters do have sex in the series.  But what you see here is what I would describe as 'tasteful fanservice', as not only are these scenes actually key to the plot, but are done in a way that doesn't feel blatant and conveys the emotion and feeling that the characters have in each moment.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Fantastic, light artwork\\n\r\n+ Stunning still moments\\n\r\n+ Tasteful fanservice (At least that's what I would regard it as)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack for Kuzu no Honkai, much like its artwork, drive home the feelings and emotions that the characters have in the moment.  The entire soundtrack, from its OP and ED to its BGMs all bear a somber and yearning tone that reflects on the different tales we see.  They aid in setting the mood of the series and honestly do a very good job at keeping the viewer engaged at the slow descent into the pit that the characters find themselves in.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  Seemingly loved by fans and panned by critics, I see that there's a clear divide on how good Kuzu no Honkai really is.  If you ask me, Kuzu no Honkai was a difficult experience due to how thick and heavy Lerche laid on the drama and emotion of the series, and it became increasingly difficult to watch as the episodes came by.  But honestly, that's why I appreciate this show.  It gives us the ugly truth on how life, particularly love, isn't perfect and that the folly of human nature can overcome even the most basic of rational thought.  While yes, I do believe that there were many parts that could be greatly improved upon, I still believe that Kuzu no Honkai has something to offer.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIt's a bit hard to say.  As a show that was intended to have very few redeeming qualities due to the nature of the story and its characters, it's hard to say that I specifically like anything it did.  I will say that I did appreciate the show and found it to be an intriguing watch, even if hard to view.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of specifics, I'm not a fan of the side interests of Moca and Sanae.  I felt like while they did have something to offer, the show honestly could've done without their involvement, as the wrenches they threw were minor when compared to other things that were going on.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I would suggest watching this just for the sake of asking people to make their own opinions.  As stated before, this show has created quite a polarizing viewpoint that has been seen as both good and bad.  If you ask me, I feel like the show delivered on what it wanted to do, and that in and of itself is something that I feel should be commended.  I wouldn't particularly say I love or even like the show, but I don't hate it and I feel like some people don't give the show the credit it deserves.  \\n\\n\r\nIn short, it's complicated.",

Kuzu no Honkai is heavy, all the characters screw up, none of them are \"good people\" and you'll probably want to slam your head into the closest wall watching them. \r\nThen why should you watch it? \r\nIt gives a different take on \"romance\". Betrayal, unrequited love, cheating. It's so raw that despite hating what the characters do you can't completely condemn them for it since this actually happens in reallife too. Though I won't call it completely realistic since it does make the drama over the top, one can't ignore that these characters are so very human with backgrounds that explain every choice they make resonate so soundly with who they are and what they are looking for. \\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai or \"Scums wish\" is not an anime for everyone but if you want a different view on romance, one who doesn't shy away from showing the ugly sides of it and how far human desire for love will take a person, this is definitely something for you. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI for once had a difficult time watching it without my blood boiling but won't deny its brilliant execution.",

            "content": "The high school Romance is a staple of the anime medium; a genre whose heavily repeated traits and clich\u00e9s have made it a source for either adoration or disgust, what with its overwhelming cheeriness and extreme market saturation. While the revulsion to the genre died down since height of the Anti-Moe movement at the beginning of this decade, some of the criticisms of the genre still stand, with its overwhelming sameness seemingly striking with ten new Shoujo every season.\r\nEnter 'Kuzu no Honkai' or 'Scum's Wish', the antithesis of the genre which came out in the Winter 2017 which soon became one of the few highlyrated series that wasn't a sequel to come out of that season. It also became one of the most talked about, and naturally one of the most divisive anime of that season. While the cover may not make it look like anything different, the series' exploration of mature themes such as sexuality and questions we often ask ourselves when in a relationship made it the talk of the anime community for quite some time, for reasons I will get into later.\\n\r\nAs said before, the series was heavily divisive, with many different opinions coming out now that the series is finished. These can be split into three categories; those who see it as nothing more than trash with awful characters and disgusting sex scenes, those who enjoy it ironically as a soap opera-style mess about terrible people doing stupid things but who don't really see much depth to it beyond that, and those who genuinely like it, considering it to be a good or even great exploration of it's themes. While I spend the first two episodes or so going back and forth between the first two (believing that it would go down as the most overrated anime of the season), you can probably tell by my high rating for the series that I oddly found myself in the latter category by the end. Funnily enough, I actually enjoyed it more as the MAL rating went down during it's airing. And the reason why is because it's themes and presentation won me over as they became more apparent to me throughout the series.\\n\r\nThe story follows Hanabi Yasuraoka, a high school student with a lifelong, aching infatuation with her older childhood friend and teacher. To console her heartache over her inability to confess her feelings, she begins a faux-relationship with Mugi Awaya, another student who is in a similar situation with his teacher. The two make an agreement to use this fake relationship to console each other until either one of them is able to get in a relationship with their respective desired objects.\\n\r\nFrom the premise, you would probably think that we're going to get a series of wacky shenanigans in which the two main characters ultimately end up together, and you would be dead wrong! As said before, this series explores highly mature themes which other entries in this genre would never dare touch. This series is dark, to the point that some have described it as to the Shoujo genre what 'Madoka Magica' was to the magical girl genre. While I wouldn't quite go that far myself, it does certainly pack a strong punch, especially when the characters reach their low points.\\n\r\nI will say that I wasn't a particular fan of the first two episodes, which deceitfully commit to various genre tropes, such as the introduction of a stereotypical Loli character who I initially found irritating but who did become more sympathetic later on. Where the story becomes really interesting is where the character's viewpoints (mostly Hanabi's) allow us an insight into the other characters (mostly Ecchan but there are other characters)who themselves offer for an extensive and disturbing insight into various ideas of love. These range from childish infatuation represented by Moka, to manipulation for personal gain represented by Ecchan and some adult characters, to simple lust represented by Mugi and Hanabi's own desires for their respective teachers, which being emotionally irresponsible teenagers they mistake for actual love. Maybe it sort of is, but they also learn a mature lesson about how love is more complicated than either they or the audience perceive it.\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, let's now talk about the most controversial aspect of the series, the sex scenes. Oh yes, this series features quite a few of them! And this has caused the biggest source of contention amongst detractors of the series, who view it as little more than soft core pornography, and that they seem to be the whole purpose of the series. Well, I probably won't disagree with that second part, they are certainly important to the narrative. Although many people are taken aback by the seeming graphic nature of these scenes, and admittedly they aren't exactly going to take away someone's masturbation abilities, they're not really as \"disgusting\" or \"shameless\" as many have said. In fact, their content is actually fairly tame compared to most HBO TV series. For me, this restraint works in the scene's favour, as it diverts more attention towards the thoughts and interactions of the characters in a given scene, allowing for the interpersonal intimacy that such a scene should convey by exposing the most innocent and ugliest parts of their personalities simultaneously. These scenes are mature, not in the sense that they are sexual or that they are for an adult audience, but in the way they are written without feeling the need to serve as fan service. Indeed, the series is surprisingly light on what I would consider to actually be fan service, as none of these scenes take away from the experience through cheap pandering, but are instead used to enhance the character's personalities.\\n\r\nIt is in these scenes that the series' greatest strength is conveyed, as it uses it's high school setting and young characters to focus on their apparent ignorance regarding sexuality and by extension love, essentially poking fun at the actions of the main characters that these sorts of series tend to have, where their lust is often the subject of comedy. This series however is very serious, and so the bright colour pallet of the series, and the conforming behaviours of many of the unnamed background characters in the halls of the school serve to complement this aspect by serving as a sort of cosy exterior to the ugly underbellies of the main character's innermost thoughts.\\n\r\nAs it is a drama, much of the focus is on the character's emotions, and this series is certainly full of them, with the character's lusts manifesting in self hatred and despair. As the characters experience the unpleasant but necessary changes which they have to bare, they are allowed to grow up and mature as a result of the harsh experiences they sometimes go through. The title of the series does imply that the characters are 'Scum', and while many of the characters do horrible things, manipulating other people, using other people for their own pleasure, they each get their own moments where, even if they are still horrible people, they are shown to have reason to be, even if that reason isn't justifiable. When the characters experience their moments of catharsis, you may find yourself changing your perspective on them as people.\\n\r\nHanabi herself often seems like an innocent spectator to the actions of a character who we learn does horrible things (I'm not going to spoil that though) and seemingly becomes interested in this at one point before ultimately backing out and coming to take control, even though it happens in the least desirable way possible. Other characters include Moka, the Loli character who harbours a childlike infatuation for Mugi due to having an idealized view of romance. And then there is Ecchan, Hanabi's close friend who secretly harbours a crush on her. There are several other characters who I won't go too into detail about, but who help to complement the series' themes and ideas.\\n\r\nI am embarrassed to say that I saw a little bit of myself in many of the characters. As I myself am only a few years older than they, I still have memories of when I was as na\u00efve as them, and to a certain extent I still am. I relate to many of their feelings, such as their lust, their admiration for other people sometimes manifesting into confused infatuation, feeling of isolation. On a less proud note, I also relate to some of their more perverted desires and some of their enjoyment in observing other people's drama. Many of us have  probably felt at least some of these at some point in our lives, and the rawness with which the series handles them, as well as the array thanks to the cast of characters representing different aspects of these feelings helping to illustrate the complexities and multitudes of these issues.\\n\r\nThe art for the series is gorgeous, the occasionally shot where characters are drawn without eyes notwithstanding. The series frequently uses metaphorical imagery to develop the narrative, such as in the first scene in which Hanabi places her hands on the unshaded part of a desk representing Kanai who in the same scene is partially shaded just like the desk. Different shades of lighting are appropriately used to convey different atmospheres depending on the scene in question. Many of the most evocative moments are created with effective uses of watercolours to illustrate the appearances of the characters. The series frequently uses a manga panel display in order to show a scene from different angles in order to bring us closer to the perspectives of the characters effectively, helping the series to maintain a consistent degree of stylishness. Another stylish trademark of the series is the use of an inkblot during scene transitions to underscore the darkness of the moment with it's blackness swallowing the screen.\\n\r\nThe background music for the series mostly consists of slow piano sounds. Not especially memorable and often minimal, but certainly effective, as it gets noticeably louder in the more dramatic moments where the dialogue comes to a halt  to leave auditory room for the music to flourish. The OP is brilliant, ranking as the 4th best of this season just behind 'March comes in like a Lion', 'Rakugo' and 'ACCA' with its dramatic effectiveness and use of visuals representative of the characters with obvious symbolism. The ED meanwhile is arguably the best of the season, with it's desperate vocals and use of Kaleidoscopic imagery featuring the characters in nude, almost resembling an orgy. This represents not only the sexual nature of the series, but also the metaphorical exposure of the characters throughout the series.\\n\r\n'Kuzu no Honkai' is certainly not a series for everyone, as it's sexually charged themes and exploration into the dark side of personal relationships can certainly be an understandable turn off for a lot of people. I myself certainly don't think it is perfect, as there are points when the story goes off into tangents which ultimately don't do anything for the plot, there are some characters who could have used more screen time, other characters who could have easily been cut, some awkward attempts at comic relief, and it may take a little while to get sued to at first. But in the end, these are ultimately trivial complaints to what is ultimately a thoroughly gripping series whose unpredictable nature regarding the destinations of each of it's sympathetic characters kept me invested each week.\\n\r\nThe series explores deep questions such as the very idea of relationships itself, and what we do to desperately get other people to like us. Kind of like how I wrote a review for the series in a desperate attempt to get other people to notice me to feather my own insecurities.\\n\r\nUltimately, 'Kuzu no Honkai' is definitely one of the standouts of the Winter season, a thought provoking exploration of the idea of love which uses the tropes of the Romance genre to deconstruct it's more questionable aspects, even if not everyone may see it that way.",

Me neither.\r\nAfter watching quite a lot of romance genre, this was very refreshing and for a fan of psychology extremely suiting. If you are looking for comedy, don't even bother. It does have bunch of 'funny' gags, but it definitelly doesn't warm up your day.\r\nStory: 10\r\nRating the story based on premise and genre, this is masterpiece. Almost every character in this show has deep mental issues. It isn't anything like craziness, but rather psychopathy. Story is constantly evolving bringing changes and development that will keep you wanting more. Even though you know it will break yourheart, you still. want. more.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nNot much to say. Without a doubt quite original art is used in this series. Not the best, but all those comic-like scenes that often pop up bring something different from your normal dose of anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nAgain, brilliant soundtrack playing during critical scenes deserves 100/10. Music brings 90% of the feels while watching something epic and/or dramatic. And boy, it sent me right on the feel train.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nI've never wanted some characters die more than in this show. I won't name them. Everyone has his own picture. But despite seeing lots of other anime where I could see bunch of evil monsters or villains, I can't compare them to these. Atleast 2 of them should be just tortured to death.... Otherwise pretty fun people.\\n\\n\r\nOverall can't help myself. This was amazing show. It was different on all kinds of levels. It had mature scenes that were done decently. No useless ecchi element.\\n\r\nSo yeah. I think it deserves second season, but I won't go as far to guarantee it. I found the end pretty satisfying.",

            "content": "This show is very different to most other romance/drama type of stories, and consequently, in order to judge it fairly, it needs to be considered differently from the run-of-the-mill standard.\r\nIts overarching premise is \"Unrequited love\". People fall in love with others, but their feelings are not reciprocated. We see the characters hope and despair, persevere and suffer, try and fail. This is no string of happy occasions, where justice wins, villains lose and the story ends in celebration. If you watch the show, be aware of that and be ready for an _ordeal_. This is no light entertainment, this is a masochistic marathon leaving youdrained.\\n\\n\r\nFor those however, who are willing to invest the time and are not scared of emotional bruises, this show is a total treat. The direction and technical execution is fantastic, the soundtrack exceptional, the art very nice and the storytelling exemplary. Romance drama is usually a string of corny, cliche-ridden scenes which follows a predictable path. Kuzu no Honkai is anything but. Once the introduction of all characters is completed around episode 6, I daresay that no single unspoiled viewer would be able to predict how the show was going to end.\\n\\n\r\nI always want to add that viewers who already had own life experiences with unrequited romances will be able to connect much better with the show's characters. Myself, I could see traces of three characters in me. Those people who criticized the show the most had no experiences of their own to gauge the show's characters against.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you are primarily looking for a story with typical characters going through the romance/drama motions in the typical drama arc hoping for the typical happy ending, Kuzu no Honkai does not only not deliver, it betrays these expectations. If on the other hand you want to see a character study of various forms of unrequited love, what people think, and why they do what they do, as ugly as it may be, this show will be a fantastic experience. Very instructive, very touching at times, and extremely unusual.\\n\\n\r\nComing with my highest recommendations.",

However, this series is an exceptional.\r\nFirst of all, i have to say they have done a great job in adapting the manga series into an anime. I have seen many of the adaptations but rarely encounter any anime that actually captured every single important details from manga into an anime, and Kuzu no Honkai does. Basically if you watched the anime, you'll get 99.9% story line of the manga which save the hassle of thinking whetherthe anime is lacking of any important points and need to drill it from the manga series to solve your \"craving\".\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, guess this is one of the most realistic series that is not focus to \"must-pairing-the-MCs-for ending\" or a happy-yay ending. It obviously twist and turn your thought and prediction towards the series. More like going for an emotional journey when you watch it. From curiosity, to feel bad, funny, boring, hate and speechless etc. Not to mention, you'll surprise that you will unsure who is the one supposed to be hated or ship with. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, i gave a 9/10. Save the 1 point for me to calm down my mind and move on to another series :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I really enjoyed Kuzu no Honkai because the romance and characters felt more real to me than any other anime I've seen in the romance genre. While aspects of the story weren't exactly the most realistic (especially for a high school in Japan), the complex emotions that the characters were dealing with and trying to convey throughout the whole anime is what felt very genuine to me. \r\nGenerally, romance animes tend to be in the shoujo category and have very simple, cookie cutter characters and reused plot devices. They tend to retell the same story of a rose-colored, first love that satiates a certain kindof hunger if that's what you're looking for, but doesn't leave you with anything more than that. Kuzu no Honkai really delves into a bunch of complex emotions and takes its time in elaborating on some of them. Moments like when Hanabi and Ecchan were hanging out and Hanabi was like \"I don't want to label this\" were fantastic and very realistic moments to me. Love is hard to define. And it can be different from person to person and relationship to relationship. It was fascinating getting to see each characters' complex emotions regarding love and desire and personal opinions about themselves and their self-worth. These different perspectives and the mature way in which the topic was approached and delivered was absolutely compelling. All throughout the anime we get to explore characters' sexualities, their tumultuous emotions, their thought processes behind why they do certain things or why they think this way, and learn about them as they learn about themselves. I would almost go as far as to say that this is a coming of age anime since we get to live through the casts' self discoveries and final maturations. \\n\\n\r\nThe beautiful thing about Kuzu no Honkai is that it's a seinen, and therefore has a more mature, if not cynical, view on romance as a whole. Because Japanese culture is very homogeneous and places a lot of emphasis on avoiding real conflict, female innocence, and gender roles, we rarely get something that deviates from the norm in the romance genre, especially since the anime market has settled down from the experimental years of the early to late 2000's. This anime bends this genre in a darker, more pragmatic way that I, personally, have not seen before. Refreshed isn't exactly the word I'm looking for, more like I feel very satisfied after watching Kuzu no Honkai, like I've gotten to watch something I've been waiting to experience for years now.\\n\\n\r\nSome additional notes: \\n\r\n5 seconds into the first episode and I was in love with the animation style. The art and music complimented the characters and story phenomenally. There was a lot of visual symbolism throughout the anime with colors, or the lack thereof, representing characters emotions or mental states at the time. I thought it was all very well thought out and well-executed.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was also above par. No voice ever seemed out of place to me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a very rewarding experience for me. I feel like I've gotten something more out of this anime than just entertainment. This isn't just about a guy and a girl getting together. This anime is about the complexities of human emotions, self-discovery, and different kinds of relationships from various perspectives. It was a very interesting watch to say the least. =)",

            "content": "I'm submitting this review in hopes that anyone scrolling through the sea of reviews deciding whether to start an anime based on the average score will be able to read this or even take a glance at this and decide to give this wonderful series a go. \r\nI know, there's a load of negative reviews about this series but honestly most of Kuzu no Honkai's flaws exist because it is a series that's not fully understood hence, not fully appreciated. I mean, this is a series trying to deliver what the definition of love is and we all know love is scarily subjective. No onereally have a true understanding or meaning to love, not even when we are 78 year olds and have been married for half a century. No, we don't truly know love but we are always constantly learning new things about love. We as human beings yearn to love and be loved, so we learn to love and be loved. Constantly, always. \\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\\n\r\nThat's Kuzu no Honkai's story. It's not a fluffy love story or a tragic melodrama, it's kind of in between. Yes, it's like a small window to real life and human relationships.\\n\\n\r\nIt's built on making mistakes from wanting to be loved, to consequences from loving someone much like we do in life. Whether it be during our adolescents or our first love, whether it be a form of naivety that we did not once understand. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIt must be a sad thing to have fall so deeply in love with someone but to have it not ever happen. \\n\r\nThat's the whole premise of Kuzu no Honkai.\\n\\n\r\nIt's actually a simple story when you break it down, there are four main characters(or five if we go on a little stretch) and all of them really just want to find happiness through love. What happens in the next 12 episodes follow the eyes of this characters as each of them goes through their life and relationships to understand what it is they want out of love and out of their relationships. \\n\\n\r\nTheir definition of love sometimes parallels one another but most of the time their expectations of love are different from one another. Almost all of the characters have a hole to be filled and they seek to constantly feed that hole, even while edging on the brink of what is considered to be morally correct and wrong. \\n\\n\r\nYou probably shouldn't approach this series with rose tinted shoujo glasses but I know you are not here for that. This series is not a dark romance but does a good deal in shedding light on the twisted thoughts people can have - be it intentionally or not. You might come to hate the characters or grow to love them but you will not be able to deny that when you are in any one of their shoes, there's a high chance you would do the same. It's not twisted as much as it is human.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKuzu no Honkai manage to break down the whys of the character actions. The character monologues are wonderfully weaved to be relatable to the audience. Even when their actions are contradictory on the surface, the anime makes sure you understand that no- it's not that much of a conflict in their actions and emotions after all.  There's something beautiful and absorbing about the way the monologues form a narrative in the story on many occasions. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThere's no strong \"climax\" nor is there a constant flow of angst drama. But there is resolution for every character and well written development. It's a character driven plot but the storyline never ever lends itself to be overly carried by any character. That's how it always should be, no one should take centre stage. Life happens because everyone is struggling on their path and a story is form at the right point in time when all their paths connect. Kuzu no Honkai did a good job holding back on that despite the many ways it could turned out to be. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI'll just write about the two leads because they are what I feel, the primary focus and should be enough to draw anyone in to watch. \\n\\n\r\nHanabi is an endearing character. She's almost, almost like a canvas. It's not like she's a naive girl or a pure white state but she is good will in her thoughts and she is a kind girl that is just trying to have someone love her back. Her character development is one of the highlights of the show. Despite so many times when her character could have gave in and she could become a very much different character(or worse), she always seem to get back on the right path. That's an unwavering will in a sense. I don't think many could have thought the same as her when exposed to the kind of circumstances. Without spoilers, in a sea of choices where it would be far more advantageous to her to take an easy way out she is the kind of character that while appearing fleeting is actually strong willed. That is to say, she rather grow up than to take the easy way out. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMugi, on the other hand, is a representation of adolescent boys. He's not kind or nice in any measure nor is he actually downright evil or a manipulative when it comes to love. Like Hanabi, he wants to be love and to seriously love someone.  He's a good insert character if you were a hot dude but honestly, I didn't think most of us are. That's not to say he's unrelatable. Breaking him down, there's a lot of aspects to Mugi that's like us and like boys. For instance the idea of wanting to be the only hero to save the damsel in distress, the desire to be wanted by pretty girls, adolescent frustration and desire all packaged into one. I'm sure we all guys felt like him at one point of our life. What this series does is show us one perspective of how such a character, and like all of us, could grow from this flaws into a better person. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great on their own but keep in mind that their interactions are the ones that make this series shine. The other two(or three if we are willing to go a little further) are also well written characters with their own motivations and complexity in them. Although for one of them, I would say their complexity lies instead in being too simple a person(it's not that much of a contradiction once you finished this series, trust me) .\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\\n\r\nThe manga uses darker ink and lines but the anime have a more Shoujo-esque and watercolour approach to it which I really like. I think that's how it should be. Need I mention that the art is gorgeous to look at? The characters are beautiful too.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nEasy contender for the season's best OP/ED. Even if the negative reviews keep harping on and on, they'll never let this one be a bad point because the opening and ending complements the story so well and is so good that I actually started this series because of the ending by Sayuri. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nI won't say it's up to your taste to try this or not and that it's a cup of a tea thing because it's really not. In my eyes, Kuzu no Honkai is a window to inevitable problems we will face in our life. The problem and the subject of love is not restricted to this two adolescents but instead can widely apply to anyone who constantly seek the answer to the question of love. There might never be an answer and that is probably true but Kuzu no Honkai is what it is, a wish, no matter how scummy, to desire the answer. And even if you are wrong or even if you fall, maybe sometimes it's all about moving forward to try again. True love is out there, afterall.  \\n",

            "content": "A specific question should be answered when watching Kuzu no Honkai:  WHY DO YOU LOVE? Presenting, the pathophysiology of how love can go wrong and specifically, the scumbag disease - that is what Kuzu no Honkai generally is.  Some thought that this is the second coming of an anime that gone in the end (SD) which is certainly not however, let me tell you this, if you want to know a reason of how it could turn out like that SD anime or just want to prevent a love like that happen to you in real life, Kuzu no Honkai is a must-seeanime.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nHats off to the depth that the story portrays.  I mean, I was expecting that it wouldn't go well to some mangas that are given anime, I feel that it took its liberty to wittingly compress it into 12 episodes without giving too much from the manga and just subtly giving the overall motivation of the character on why they love this other character.  I was also expecting that feeling of dissatisfaction but there wasn't.  Of course, some of us would tell otherwise if they've read the ongoing manga but I'm really glad that I haven't and I could say that I'm happy to how they end the anime.  Because, given that they have ended the characters on how some of us want to ship it or not, I feel Kuzu no Honkai conveyed the message perfectly to the viewers:  Loving like this wouldn't work, would hurt you and would only trigger the cycle.  I applaud Kuzu no Honkai for that.  Whether the truth is subtly or blatantly slapped on your face, morale lesson delivered.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI like how the characters are presented to to me a a viewer because of how much they made an impact on me.  Like the female teacher, for example. Sure, I hate this kind of person to the core but at the same time, they gave them enough reason on why she turned out that way and therefore I sympathize on her (well, a little) and I also do feel the same for the other characters to the extreme.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is, I like how each characters represent a specific type of motivation in why they love.  For example, the character Kamamobeta, do you know what kind of motivation she represent? Do you know why she dressed in a wedding gown at the last chapter's fashion show?  The characters are simply deep and realistic.  I don't see why one argue that they are taken to the extreme.  No, there are people whose motivation in love are like that, consciously or subconsciously, sad to say.  The way each episode's story flows, the flashbacks, their self-reflections/thought processes and how their motivations are changed, I could therefore conclude that they effectively designed the character because these triggered my emotions. Each are effectively compelling. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNo one could deny that the art is great.  I specifically like how each of the characters eyes are drawn as it changes from being alive to dead.  The eyes are made distinctively blank as if to let the viewers know that they are unmistakably empty.  Also, the ED song's background art is so amazing especially the kaleidoscope part where they presented the lovers.  It's just smartly done.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nGreat voice acting and I think the guys would definitely agree (high five).  It's so stimulating.  The OP and ending is so catching visually and acoustically.  Although I don't know the specific genre (must be pop rock) the OP is very lively and the ED is moving.  The music animation is appropriate.  Actually, I was even moved when I read the lyric english translation of the ED at the last episode.  I think it's just appropriate and it's beautiful. I think if an anime with managed to make me remember the music, it is good indeed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt is not a surprise that the majority of the viewers are not comfortable with Kuzu no Honkai's story.  I for fact is a little uncomfortable; however, although it is really a stimulating and compelling anime, I only opened my mind and took note note of the story and its genre and I considered that this should it not a big problem for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThumbs up!  Add it with my teary eyes for special effects.  As one might argue that some characters have gone to the extreme of being a scumbag.  Maybe it's because they are uncomfortable of some \"scenes\",  still hasn't explored certain topics in real life (failed relationships, sex, etc.) or expecting a fairy tale happy ending (like Kamamobeta, one of the characters).  Such is life. However, the story and the characters with a perfect touch of arts and music are enough to make me want to watch more and see how the story is developed.  I want to know their motivation, what will happen to them in the end,  and how the cycle could end  and this is exactly why I feel this is a good anime to start and end with the question:  WHY DO I LOVE?",

            "content": "After watching a bunch of cliche rom-com animes, Kuzu no Honkai was like a breath of fresh air to me. Strangely enough, this air wasn't fresh one, but rather full of scum. Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily!\r\nLet's start with the story. Just as an aside, when I first heard the plot and watched the first episode, my friends and I called it \"emo Toradora.\" This anime is not very plot-driven. Essentially, a bunch of people trying to work out their feelings for each other. Sounds pretty much like any other romance anime, right? Well, scummy things happen and those of you who likedrama will get some sort of kick out of the happenings of Kuzu no Honkai. If you don't like angst, the story is kind of meandering.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the art. The art was unique, I'll give it that. The art was kind of like a blend of pastels, with gentle, flowery colors. Oh man, the amount of flowers and petals and stuff in this show. Then you got the fade to ink black cuts that provided a nice contrast. Overall, it was unique and portrayed the lighter and darker moments pretty well. I prefer a cleaner sort of style, but I could see what they were going for. It stuck out from the other animes I've been watching recently, so bonus points for that.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the characters, which were the driving force for the whole anime. There's the main cast of four, with Hanabi being the main character. That's how it starts out, at least. We get a good idea of each person's story, personality, and world-view through their own eyes, one at a time. Things happen between them, and things change. It's interesting to watch unfold. Certain characters are extremely interesting and fleshed out, and others are briefly and awkwardly introduced. They all react poorly in the face of the drama that takes place, which was a hoot for me. The characters, their actions, and their views are realistic, which is great. Once again, if you don't like angst, you won't like any of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the sound. The music throughout the anime is fitting, though nothing really stood out as great. What got a 9 out of me was the OP and the ED. Well, the OP was good. But the ED. That song is gosh-darned amazing. The way that they gently start to play it near the end of the episode was always well-timed and the message of the song is quite fitting for the show. The first few times I heard it, I wrote it off, but the guitar leading into the ED and the ED itself finally hit me. Needless to say, I bought the CD/DVD of the ED. Great song.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the heck out of Kuzu no Honkai. The story can be dumbed down to something like \"Scum interact with other Scum,\" but I rather enjoyed the drama. I also have no shame when I say I enjoyed the amount of sexual content in this anime. It was done in a tasteful way, anyways, and it never got lewd enough for me to go \"OK, this is just fanservice.\" If seeing a bra gives you a nosebleed, go watch something more wholesome like Toradora.\\n\\n\r\nSince I was getting bored of cliche romance animes, like to watch people suffer as a result of their own actions (this is real life, bich), and love great music, I give Kuzu no Honkai a solid 8.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Scum's Wish (Kuzu no Honkai) is a fantastic anime about terrible people. Its story is surprisingly deceptive, and surprisingly headstrong in its delivery. Scum's Wish will take no prisoners, and it's not afraid to show you a world that's more like our own than any I've seen in anime to date. \r\nTo cover all the necessary aspects beforehand: Scum's Wish has a decent - perhaps even moderately good - soundtrack. Its music complements each scene well with dramatic effect and necessary tonal shifts. Its art style is more unique than most, engaging with in-screen boxes and out-of-sync sound bites, although I must admit that, likemost anime of its kind, it falls into the trap of making almost all of its male characters virtually identical. That said, the cast is small enough - a point I'll return to - that this isn't an issue. Its voice actors are all very well chosen, and their internal monologues are a particular highlight, as the anime lets you gradually uncover the changing and evolving personalities of these characters. \\n\\n\r\nTo talk about something more interesting, though: the characters. As I mentioned, Scum's Wish is about terrible people. There won't be anyone here you'll like, there won't be anyone to sympathise with, but the anime dances so dangerously close to making every character sympathetic that it's sort of mind-boggling. The story as it's laid out on screen is that the main characters, Hanabi and Mugi, are both in love with people who love someone else, but in reality, it's more of a chain. Hanabi (who is loved by Sanae) loves Narumi, who loves Akane (who is loved by Mugi (who is loved by Noriko)) who loves no one but herself. It's complicated. Of all these characters, it's Akane that I find most interesting, and I feel that besides Mugi and Hanabi, she has had the most development: she's so unlikeable, but there's so much truth and substance to her character, she's probably the most real of all. With the cast at its current size - the aforementioned and two or three occasional extras - the room for development is vast, and Scum's Wish fully engages with growing and changing characters. Unlike so many anime, which take a two-dimensional character with one specific trait and run with it, the characters in Scum's Wish are genuinely affected by their surroundings. Hanabi especially graduates her initial feelings of self-doubt and loneliness, and even shifts her focus from Mugi to Ecchan (Sanae) to Akane between episodes. Scum's Wish isn't afraid to explore themes very prevalent in our own world, and by taking the worst of humanity and exploiting it, the show conveys an important moral message. \\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say it isn't without its flaws. For all its moral worth the anime borders on being carefully-moderated pornography at times, and the excess with which sexual themes appear is both an advantage and a disadvantage. To explore the negatives first: sex and the dreaded word \"fanservice\" are bandied about in Scum's Wish to such an extent that the viewer begins to filter them out; sure, it's going to appeal to some people, but it's what ELSE happens in the show that's stimulating to watch. However, as with other points I've made, I feel like Scum's Wish is daring to make that leap that so few anime creators dare to take. What I mean by this is, and I'll be frank here, sex is common in the real world. Whether we want to admit it or not, kids at Hanabi and her peers' age will be thinking about and perhaps even actively participating in sexual activity. I think the show is risky in its potentially encouraging such acts, but it takes an unspoken truth and runs with it: in this twenty-first century, relationships are becoming more and more meaningless as dating apps and websites take over our romantic lives and dictate to us who we should like and how much. In this twenty-first century, people hook up all the time and no one bats an eye. So when the characters in Scum's Wish end up cheating on each other more times than I care to count, it's not even really cheating. It's just the accepted norm today. \\n\\n\r\nScum's Wish is well worth the watch. I've tried to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible, but spoilers aren't really an issue in an anime of this kind. It's a wholly untraditional, wholly modern and somewhat macabre take on relationships in the real world, uniquely presented, that sounds better than average, and tries to teach its audience that moral message I mentioned earlier: love isn't perfect. It isn't all it's made out to be, so make it what you want it to be.",

Animations are good and everything looks stunning.\r\nSound 9:\r\nI love the ED for Scum's Wish.

The character development in Scum's Wish is something that I liked. Seeing characters being beaten and torn apart emotionally and watching them grow is a sight to see. Going further than the series into the manga, most if not all characters go to a complete radical change and shows the viewer that they have grown out of their weakness and bloomed into a new person.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9.5:\\n\r\nAt first and through the beginning of the series, I personally didn't like it but there was a drive in me to keep watching it to see what would happen in the next episode and I'm glad that I stuck to it. Every ending to an episode gave more and more suspense and hooked you in. Going even further into the manga, I enjoyed it very much. Like what I said in the characters rating, I loved watching the characters develop into the character they are.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.5:\\n\r\nI love this anime. It gave a change of pace from the typical romances on how this series focused on unrequited romance and how the characters tried to replace them, giving them false love. Even though it might be hard to pick up sometimes due to a certain character who I will not name, the next episode always delivered with new suspense which hooks you in.",

Released somewhere in the messy schedule of 2017's seasonal shitfest, a time when I was still with more dignity to even consider diving into the cursed land of seasonal Anime, but it was just a matter of time until I picked it out of my plan-to-watch list.\r\nHonestly, if it wasn't for the nostalgic ending song that I happen to have heard during its release, it would have been still buried in my endless list to an unnamed day, and oh boy did it still disappoint at the end.\r\n- Story(4/10):\\n\r\nA Plot you say? Nowhere to be found, or at least, not one that makes sense anyway. I would have probably settled down with rating it a \u201c0/10\u201d, but given the consideration of nitpicky things it did remarkable right, it was going to be a cruel judgment in its right.\\n\r\nHow do I put this in words?! It was as if the poor contributors of this lost cause of a story were cursed with a savage beast from the underworld, equipped with a pointy baton that kept smashing every sense of plot there is to smithereens and everything related, ending up wasting a plotline of great premise (and unfortunately, poor execution).\\n\r\nIt all started when two naive high schoolers started hooking up as a sort of medicine they had to take to cure the depression that came from their crushes never accepting their feelings for them. Would they be able to heal their scars at the end?\\n\r\nA truly appealing premise with somewhat of a sense of identity that doesn't follow the common mainstream formula of storytelling and provokes a lot about taboo relationships and lost pride to a youthful lust that doesn't know the way (It's been a year since that meme was a thing, get over it).\\n\r\nAlong the lines of using a creative visual rule to lay out the story (more on this later), it was complimented with a yet unique approach that revolved around telling the story through different monologues of the characters involved that helped bring everything full circle, giving you a sense of satisfaction after you see every scenario from different perspectives.\\n\r\nIt was somewhere midway where everything broke down like a terrible train wreck that you'd think the writer was barely having a cohesive thought process and still wrote down whatever came in mind with no consideration to common sense like a damn drunkard that literally every episode becomes like a taunting fever dream.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (8.7/10):\\n\r\nOn the surface, it's apparent that \u201cKuzu no Honkai\u201d is visually distinguishable if you look attentively, you'd notice the rough lines around the edges, especially on the characters, design-wise, they looked really good, perfected modern scribbles that try to stay as Anime as possible all while still trying to keep the realism most of the Anime lack visually.\\n\r\nBut that was not the reason it was so self-defining at all, the Manga-like lay out on some of the scenes do leave a great mark on the show that tells it apart, having a static background behind a two highlighted face close up Manga-style does leave room for so much more symbolism and a great breather for the overall animation.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\\n\r\nLet's get the minor things away, the voice acting was decent, I really liked Hanabi's voice actress, going with a perfect tone of voice, while the rest of the case was pretty average, aside from maybe Akane's. But man, did I hate Moca's high pitched voice that screams of a childish loli.\\n\r\nThe opening song was good, but not half a quarter as good as the ending is, and as I stated, a fantastic vocal performance that's the reason I decided to finally watch the show for.\\n\r\nThere goes another bad adaptation that has fantastic vocals (The same as \u201cTaboo Tattoo\u201d and its undeserved opening song).\\n\\n\r\n- Characters (3/10):\\n\r\nQuite a shallow over dramatic cast if I have ever seen one.\\n\r\nLet's start by labeling every single one of them as a \u201cScum\u201d, don't you love it when a show is that much self-aware that it says it in the title?\\n\r\nProbably the most uninteresting, contradicting and hypocritical group of characters out there. If the plot is to blame for 70% of flaws surrounding this show, the characters can take the other 50%, I know, that doesn't add up to 100%, because it's how much sense this show make anyway.\\n\r\nThis was an example for a show that had a faster plot than the characters can keep up with, you'd be expecting even the slightest character development after a certain event, but no, not even after you, as a viewer, read all of the hints they let out and thinking, oh, logically, X is going to be the outcome, oh, let me stop you right there, scum and logic have nothing in common.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\\n\r\nDespite the many lows in there, there was a reason I sit through this in 2 days straight, although, I was starting to get fed up of the overly dramatic turnouts nearing the conclusion of the story.\\n\r\nI had quite the laugh on some parts, and even nearly sympathized with some characters, but not after the plot turned its back on me giving me the middle finger.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (6.64/10):\\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a recommendation entry in my book, if you were looking for any of the five rules of thumb that makes a show watchable (listed above), then you see how bad this one scales up, although, if you can settle with some drama that you won't have to take seriously, this is one hell of a guilty pleasure that I probably will never end up rewatching.",

I'm personally a sucker for drama and romance anime, so naturally I'd see this as right up my alley. However, the more I watched it, the angrier and more saddened I became. Saddened not because of the plot, but because of the animation that just doesn't do this anime justice. At first glance, anyone can tell this show has detailed and brightly colored art. At first glance, anyone would say the animation is good. However, that isn't the case. The colorful animation might work in stills, but the way theanime handles the animation is deplorable. If I could pick one phrase to describe how the animation affected my watching experience, I'd pick \"immersion breaking.\" Kuzu no Honkai likes to use layered panels over the frame. This is the main gripe I have with Kuzu no Honkai. Many people would look at it and think \"moving manga\" and they wouldn't be wrong. It's exactly that, but done poorly. It's not quite moving manga in the aspect that it changes nothing and just animates the panels already given, but rather it's the overlapping. When writing a romance drama, the most important thing you need is immersion. You want your audience to be invested in your characters and what happened to them. But most importantly, you want your characters and world to feel real. This is where the animation plays. The use of manga-like panels breaks the immersion and stomps on it's dead carcass. By placing the panels over the frame that's actually taking place, the anime is telling us that the anime is indeed an anime. That might sound like common sense, but imagine watching a really good drama. Imagine watching something terrible happening to your favorite character. You're invested, you care about them. You don't think of them as a bunch of drawings being moved in quick succession, but as a human being with emotions. By making the world around the characters feel fake, the characters will feel fake too. I can't stand to see panels that are just zoom in shots of the character's face if they're already in the shot(it would've been better with just a jump cut). My connection with this fictional world is broken. That isn't the only thing wrong with the animation. This will also do with the panel format. Sometimes there will be not one, but two panels on the frame. Written down, that doesn't sound too bad, but in action it's even worse. It's two different frames layered ontop of another frame. This means there are three focuses of that shot. Once all three frames are introduced, the worse thing you could do is reuse one of the frames so the audience is thinking about which frame is the one talking instead of what's going on in the anime. That might sound like a nitpick, but it really just adds to breaking my immersion. This next one is also a nitpick. The color pallet is a little iffy. Kuzu no Honkai uses this bright pallet. I personally don't think this works well with a romance drama of this ilk. I think it'd work better with a darker more desaturated pallet to match the emptiness of it's characters. Speaking of the characters, they're excellent. Well, except for the loli and the teacher. By episode 6, I forgot the loli existed and the teacher bitch just felt comically evil. \"I slept with the man you love, muahahahaha!\" The other characters actually have some humanity injected into them. They have human-like emotions and relationships with people. Now I'm going to doubt many people made it to the end of this review, brushing it off as \"just some guy nitpicking\" but to anyone that made it down here, thank you. A lot of people might be thinking \"How can the animation bring your score down so low?\" And to that I say, it's all in how much I enjoyed it. The immersion is very important to me, and if it's broken I no longer enjoy the show. I know 6 may be harsh, but it's honestly how I feel about this anime. Kuzu no Honkai, in my books, will remain a solid 6.",

This Anime hits hard i tell you. If you love plot and plot with plot twist this is the anime for you. Kuzu no Honkai is not only masterfully written and directed, but articulates these strong emotions of loneliness, emptiness and sadness to perfection. From a story that makes you grip to those anime hours, to the art which is amazingly done, to the directing of the anime where it creates the perfect mood and is especially amazing looking,tothe music which captures the very essence of the story and finally the characters are perfectly written. Whilst i am writing this i am feeling sad as there is no season 2 or movie.But that shows you how amazing Kuzu no Honkai is. Kuzu no Honkai is listed as an ecchie, and to all the people who may not watch it because you may see nudity, it isnt anything like that. You never see any nudity, you just know that things are happening. After looking through other reviews, they really dont do it justice. Like come on a 6? what is that a 4? seriously what the ... . Watch Kuzu no Honkai. It is amazing. Everything makes sense in it. I seriously despise reviews like that, making you picture the anime badly, when that isn't true. Reading those reviews actually made me search up how to write a review just so that i can tell you how amazing it is.\\n\r\n/emptiness/\\n\r\nHave a great day anyone reading! add me up if you wanna talk!",

            "content": "This anime is far and above my favorite of this season.  I always thoroughly look forward to all Noitamina anime, as they are almost always utterly amazing.  Typically anime does not do sex scenes tastefully, aside from a few josei anime, or BL's, but it's nice to see a romance anime that can make me feel a bit steamy, if you know what I mean.  Typically, anime dedicated to the male demographic is completely obscene, and has no plot - instead they get their views with oversized breasts bouncing all over the place, and up skirt panty shots.  It saddens medeeply to see how many anime of that nature there are, but at the same time, it makes the joy of finding an anime like \u30af\u30ba\u306e\u672c\u61d0 that much more powerful.  \\n\\n\r\nStory 10\\n\r\nAs of this point, the story is amazing.  The pacing is incredible - after every episode you can't help but click the next one desperately to see what happens next.  \\n\\n\r\nArt 9\\n\r\nPretty much all the anime these days have amazing art.  I think there were a few times when I felt like the way her mouth moved was more of an 8/10, but with the rest of the art being amazing, it's up at 9/10 overall.  I also felt like some of the licking was excessive.  Maybe I'm just more into biting than licking, so maybe this should go in the story section?  I'm not sure - for me it was both visually strange, and strange in the context of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9\\n\r\nCan't complain, the songs aren't 10/10 best ever, but they're still amazing, and I enjoy them thoroughly every time they come on, and listen to the opening and closing in their entirety every time.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10\\n\r\nDevelopment is awesome, I find myself remarking out loud, sometimes at the top of my lungs, various passionate sentiments I feel about various characters, though I'd rather not spoil the story by sharing what those remarks are.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\r\nI've made it to the last episode that has been released so far about 5 minutes ago, and I'm already in withdrawal.  This anime is FANTASTIC.  I enjoy it so thoroughly, it's definitely a 10/10 for me, which is an honor I do not give to very many anime.  I enjoy hundreds of anime thoroughly, but the majority are kept at 9's to make room for only the very very very best at the top 10.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10.\\n\r\n10\\n\r\n10\\n\r\n10. Period.  10.",

In fact, it is very realistical up to a point and this may be very boring for most of us anime watchers, as we seek to live impossible lives arm in arm with our characters but, this doesn't happen with this anime. The question is: what doesthis anime do perfectly? The answer I found from the first episode is pace. Dear lord, never have I seen such a fluid pace that makes everything fall into the right place at the right time. I could point out a couple of anime that has a well established pace but that's not my intention for this anime because I can't, or rather than that, I'm not able to compare it. That being said, I give the \"story\" a 10 because of the pacing as the anime is still ongoing as for the real rating will be after the ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The story, as most of the viewers think, is dark but the contrast it creates with the visual artwork is addictive. Studio Lerche really outdid themselves with this artwork. The colours are in darker tones, to amplify the vibe that the story gives but the way that they use them is smart. As usual the hair colours of the characters gives us insight of their personalities but it can be misleading. I recommend analyzing their traits through the meaning of colours. Last but not least, every \"mature scene\" is created in an unique way and I included them here because they are the \"spices\" for our artistic soup because, without them, this anime's appeal wouldn't be as impressive as it is. Therefore, for the art, no mark is acceptable other than 10, as a sign of respect for Lerche who put so much effort into this.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I'm going to skip the opening and the ending songs because they're masterpieces (the lyrics have meanings which are found in the story itself) and talk about the soundtracks. This is my main criteria for a good anime because without well picked soundtracks, no anime can get an overall 10 from me. In Kuzu no Honkai, the OSTs are subtle and emphisizes the characters inner thoughts. Most are calm and soothing mostly because of the volume but they are not \"special\" in some way. But, I gave it a 10. The reason is: best VA ever heard. No matter how great the scene is, if the VA mess up then everything falls to ruins. Voice Acting is important because if the VA doesn't empathizes with the character, they will sound \"fake\" and the feeling of living through the anime dissapears.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The only thing that makes them special is realism. The title is \"Scum's wish\" because they know who they are and what repercussions their actions will have. Their desires are selfish, just like the human nature and they act according to one. For spoiler reasons I will not talk more about them but my personal opinion is: the inner dialogues are top-notch, made with the intention of giving subtle hints about their choises which are not naive or stupid, they are needed for them to survive emotionally. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment: As I wait for the next episodes, I think about the possible outcomes from my point of view and that makes it interesting because I've never seen such an anime. Each episode has its glow that shines differently from the others and it feels like watching a well done hollywood love movie. Even if there are mature scenes, there is no need for showing nudity because like the rest of the anime it is full of symbolism which means that you have analyze the aspects that this anime presents you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Kuzu no Honkai is one of the best anime that this season gave us because this fresh breath of originality will pave the way for more high quality anime for seinen anime. \\n\\n\r\nThank you very much for reading this.",

It is an intense cultural shock. Even for those who are used to Japanese culture.\r\nBe a replacement, seek affection. Feeling lovely. It is what best describes this anime.

            "content": "It doesn't require someone with a degree in psychology to work out that Scum's Wish isn't for everyone. In fact, it isn't for the majority of people, but for those few who understand the pain of unrequited love, but more precisely, the mental (and sometimes physical) hardship it brings.\r\nWhen I began to watch this anime, I was impressed at how physical this show got. It reminded me of Elfen Lied, where the anime wasn't afraid to disturb the viewer, and it didn't give a fuck about the viewer in general, or how much it disturbed them.\r\nAs for the actual genre, and the type of emotionthis anime gave off, I'd say it is much closer to School Days. Where School Days was unlikeable because of how badly written and cringey it was, Scum's Wish is unlikeable because of how incredibly and uncomfortably honest and realistic it can get.\\n\\n\r\nBoth School Days and Scum's Wish have much in common, this can't be denied. However where Scum's Wish stands far above the other, is in the actual characters, even if both casts are scum. \\n\r\nIn the case of Makoto Itou, he manipulated the other girls for his own personal desires. Nothing else. \\n\r\nHowever in the case of Hanabi and Mugi, they manipulated others to fill in for their own pain \u2013 their own void left behind by the unrequited, failed love between them and their respective crush. During some of the more physical scenes, we truly get to feel their pain and despair, to the extent of which I have never seen shown in anime. These scenes were probably some of the best scenes the anime had to offer, (not due to the nudity, mind you... there are websites for that in particular.) because we got to listen to the feelings and monologues of these characters' emotions and remorse as they went through various sexual activities.\\n\\n\r\nThat, is where the show really got to shine. (Or suck, depending on your taste and outlook.)\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are truly despicable, even if they are very well-written. Some are sadistic as they cannot get enough of the company of others, some are willing to go through with this just to see others suffer... Either way, the whole cast acts on their extremely selfish nature.\\n\\n\r\nThe honesty of this show is spectacular. The characters are shown in very intimate moments with various people, as it tries to explain their scrambled, and confused minds. Experimentation is a common sight among high-schoolers, as that is the period where this confusion is common, especially in terms of sexual orientation \u2013 something that this anime highlighted quite well.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime gets real, and quickly so. The loneliness that it often shows can be really devastating. It can really show that the even if the faultless relationships in shoujo romances may exist in small numbers, it's the dark side of love that is more commonly experienced \u2013 in short, love is a poison. Or a drug, whichever you prefer. It'll give you a high, but sooner or later, you will get hurt. Try to take more, and it will fuck you up. Trying to understand it yields confusion, trying to fight it deals more damage. You can't win against it. It will make you do things that you wouldn't do as a person, including creating rough relationships by physically using your friends as \u201creplacements\u201d for your crush, or having multiple sexual relationships, just to ease the pain. Like I said... it's all a drug.\\n\\n\r\nIs the anime difficult to watch? Yes. Very.\\n\\n\r\nWhy?\\n\\n\r\nThe reason depends on who watches it. Somebody may find the honesty too much for them, or perhaps the whole extent of the physical relationships too overwhelming. Or those very unlucky few, who can find something to relate to the anime from their former relationships, or worse again, recall bad memories from them. \\n\r\nEither way, I doubt there is a way you can walk away from this show without feeling at least a bit of misery inside of you, or sadness, or empathy, or whatever other emotion your mind can conjure up after this experience.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short, this anime is heavy. It is hard to accurately comprehend the actions and behaviour of each of the characters, simply because they act based on their lust, and not based on how they think. And it goes without saying that this type of behaviour is hardly ever logical.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly believe that Scum's Wish should be recalled as one of the truly unique gems in anime. \\n\r\nI'm certain that it can be titled a deconstruction of the romance genre. There is so much more to add to the discussion about Scum's Wish, but it isn't possible to do so in a comprehenisive way. It isn't afraid to stick to the cold, harsh truth, and treads through very sensitive subjects without a care in the world. Unfortunately, many viewers, if not the majority of them, simply cannot understand the complexity behind the anime, and simply dismiss it as the equivalent of School Days Season 2. And then there are those who simply cannot take any enjoyment out of this, for their personal reasons.\\n\\n\r\nA real shame too...",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\nGoing to say ahead... average scores forces me to rate it higher than I personally would like to. I had an absolute hate towards this Anime, but sadly enough every aspect was quite good in an objective sense of view....\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nI will keep it extremely short to avoid raging and lot of bashing of which cause would be my view towards love, relationships and sexual relationships.\r\nSo, I will tell that much that the story had pretty unique and good structural presentation. It has fairly odd depth to it,drama and convoluted emotions. It had pretty good development and conveyance of what characters feel. As well the progression, outcome and pretty much everything had fairly good and unique touch to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad side is, I felt that lot of things were not solved and could have wrapped up much better in \"structural\" way. So that is enough to mention about the story with minimum emotions to it.\\n\\n\r\nMy short personal comment would be that I absolutely detested the whole thematic, characters, drama and romance of this Anime. It made me extremely angry and depressed at the same time. So yeah, that's why I want to avoid bringing in this review too much of my personal feelings about this Anime.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nSuperb art, animation and artistic element. Beautiful eyes and female characters. With utterly devastating facial elements, expressions and smile. And very hot and pleasant, which I have to mention because usually in Anime lewd moments and scenes are hot and lewd. But this just felt utterly different, I cannot explain how, but it was bewitching.\\n\\n\r\nMusic was superb, OST had presence, emotions were strong. I will damn surely wanna learn both ED and OP at some point..\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nOnce again in minimal way.\\n\r\nGood was that they all were very annoying complex in a sense, and mostly in a really bad/evil way. But all the characters were pretty unique, had odd thought process and good progression throughout the show. As well, their emotions and whole behavior was quite powerfully delivered.\\n\\n\r\nBad is once again that I felt lot of things were not wrapped up or had the feeling of \"completion\" . I cannot explain any better.\\n\\n\r\nMy view short comment. I almost detested every character and few who I liked were corrupted.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nI simply don't know. From \"objective\" point of view it was damn good Anime, but personally I just absolutely hated it. Just almost everything about the story, setting and the characters was absolute hell for me. i can't believe how angry and depressed I were for the most part. But at the same time I didn't want to drop it as it was built in a really interesting way.\\n\\n\r\nI would have simply rated it by my personal enjoyment. It would been closest thing to get 1/10 from me. But I do mix my ratings based on larger part by personal enjoyment + smaller amount of \"objective\" rating.\\n\\n\r\nIn short.. I would have lot of things to rant and vent here regarding the characters, story and such strong because of my views as mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nBut to sum it up,  I guess it was \"good\" Anime.\\n\r\nI feel absolutely exhausted from watching this Anime and I rather avoid this type of viewing experiences if possible.",
