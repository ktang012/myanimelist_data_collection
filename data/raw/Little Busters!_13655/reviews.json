            "content": "Over the past decade, visual novel studio 'Key' has seen much success for their work on titles such as Kanon, Clannad and Air. If you have watched or read any of these series, you will likely be familiar with Jun Maeda's distinctive form of dramatic storytelling. \r\nDo not expect another Clannad: After Story. You will not find it here. \r\nAt first glance, there is one startling difference in Key's latest adaptation. It is not animated by Kyoto Animation, the studio responsible for handling the majority of Key adaptations. Instead, the esteemed and beloved (not really) J.C. Staff is at the helm. For many this isa name that will undoubtedly be a cause for concern. In Little Busters, it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the misadventures of Riki and his four childhood friends. Set during the leader Kyousuke's final year in high school, the group of friends decide to make something of their remaining youth- not by overtly rebelling, but by practicing and playing baseball together. They cannot form a team with only five members though, which is why Riki and Rin are set to recruit more people from their school. Preferably females, as Rin is the only young lady in the group. \\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters' cast of characters is its strongest trait. No\u2014 not because they are especially well-written or unique, but because they are endearing- because they are entertaining. It isn't easy to make a group of anime characters feel like genuine friends with one another, but Little Busters manages to achieve this feat with its wonderful group dynamic. Even the later members contribute to the show in a significant and believable way. The characters truly do make the lighthearted segments a joy to watch. \\n\\n\r\nBeing part comedy, it's a good thing that the jokes are often fresh and clever. Of particular note is Masato. If you remember Sunohara from Clannad, he is a bit like that. Masato and all his muscular glory (and utter lack of brain cells) are the cause for many jokes. Usually at his expense. And usually met with a kick to the face from Rin. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame, since any appeal the show has is frequently pushed aside in favour of cringeworthy melodrama. The individual character routes were not very good in the visual novel and they are most certainly not any good here either. It would be one thing if these arcs were merely mediocre, but with J.C. Staff's lack of directorial talent they are made absolutely dreadful. The omnibus format also does little to help the rushed pacing, resulting in a format that feels highly formulaic and superfluous. One of the girls has troubles, Riki helps them to overcome it, one or two episodes of comedy follow\u2014 repeat, repeat. Thankfully the lighthearted segments are so entertaining, as otherwise you would probably detest each character by the end of their route. It is that bad at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe two worst offenders are Mio's and Haruka's routes. In Mio's route, the viewer is treated with illogical and contradictory character actions further complimented by a hilariously contrived deception on the writer's part. Plotholes? Everywhere. And it does not even attempt to answer them with anything besides equivocation. The climax could maybe be explained if the characters were taking psychedelic drugs at the time, but looking at it from a realistic perspective it does not make any sense whatsoever. Watching Utena may be less confusing. \\n\\n\r\nHaruka's route will also make you want to scream in frustration. Her tragic backstory is implausible (why the hell were the people taking care of her not convicted of abuse?) and the motivations of the antagonist, Kanata, are silly at best. The rest of the route is comprised of more cheap plot twists and embarrassingly cliche melodrama. Heck, there's even a scene where the weather changes from sunshine to storm as soon as Haruka starts crying. How much more cheesy can you get? Little Busters seems to experiment with the limits. \\n\\n\r\nThings do improve, though. After a decent start and two terrible arcs, the last third of the story provides a satisfying d\u00e9nouement showing how each of the characters have grown over the course of the series. The last episode in particular is quite nice, with the long-awaited baseball game being played in high spirits. Some might argue that this improvement is too little too late. They might be right.\\n\\n\r\nOne area where Little Busters does not disappoint is with its soundtrack. There may not be anything on the same level of \"Dango Kazoku\" to mess with your emotions, but the soundtrack as a whole is solid and surprisingly memorable. Then again, it's pretty hard to make mistakes when you are deriving almost all music from the source material.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters' endearing characters are complimented by a highly talented cast of seiyuu. Yui Horie provides a convincing role for a male character (though does little to make Riki any less bland) while Masato's seiyuu does a wonderful job at delivering the comedy. Rin and Kud on the other hand will probably kill your heart from how adorable they sound. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to praise about the art, but it certainly isn't bad. Just average. Just middling. For a TV anime it is passable, but when comparing it to previous Key adaptations you will definitely notice a significant drop in quality. Off-model faces are frequent and many scenes are reduced to panning and 'talking heads': devoid of any animation besides the character's mouth flapping. For an adaptation of one of the most successful visual novels, you would normally expect the artwork to at least be above-average. Not here. \\n\\n\r\nAs an adaptation, it is worth mentioning how it compares to the source material. Is it a bad adaptation? It is. If you want to experience the story as it is intended, it would be in your best interests to give the visual novel a read instead. On its own merits and as a condensed version of the story, however, J.C. Staff's adaptation is merely passable. It doesn't completely butcher the story but with the rushed pacing, poor characterization (especially with regards to Riki), lackluster art and incomplete story\u2014 most of the charm that made the visual novel so beloved is nonexistent here. At least there's more cute Rin scenes, though! Maybe that is the one and only good thing.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters will not be winning any awards for its writing or production qualities, but when taken as an entertaining comedy with likable characters, it is at least worth a watch. Putting aside the expectations, you will certainly find some enjoyment in Key's latest animated venture.  \\n\\n\r\nHopefully, too, J.C. Staff won't let us down too much in the sequel. I can think of few things that would be more disastrous.",

            "content": "This will be a temporarily review until the anime is completed, I created this so that people won't get any misunderstandings from others UNTIL the technical reviewers come by when the anime is completed. I've also decided to create this review for the sake of those viewers who played the visual novel, and for those who havent since I'm tired of reading all these reviews made up of self-satisfaction, and sadly by biased and unperceptive views.\r\n\u279f \"COMPARISONS AND BASELESS ASSUMPTIONS\"\r\nFirst to those who played the visual novel, please stop comparing the visual novel to the anime, they are done on completely different ways and isdifferent on a fundamental level. So please don't use the visual novel's high standings as an EXCUSE that the anime will be the same. Using 'because it's a Key story' as a reason to watch [is a different matter though*], given that the same person wrote the same scenario as the whole of Clannad (and other various animes adapted from Key's work) is a plus and a good reason to watch this anime.\\n\r\nSecond to those who are only here for the anime, please stop talking like you know everything about the anime when you have not completed the story yet (the anime is still AIRING). The slow pacing is not an excuse, many animes had slow pacing (not just for the first few episodes, it can even be over half the series) yet in the near end was seen to be praised very highly removing all those doubts for the beginning of the anime. I do not want to see people making such assumptions. As for the massive hype to you anime viewers, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A SOLE REASON AS TO WHY IT IS HYPED, DO NOT ASSUME NONSENSE and overlap it with the anime's weakpoints or disabilities. \\n\\n\r\n\u279f \"CYNICISM AND SINCERITY\" \\n\r\nGeneric? I will not use this as an excuse but give this anime a break, the visual novel was created in 2007, though it was after Clannad, it's not a surprise there will be some generic settings and characters in this anime. Actually not everyone gets tired of these sorts of things, but those who do get tired... if you can overlook that, then go for it and watch it especially for the romance, drama and Key magic given. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GIVING A DAMN ABOUT THE REPETITIVE USE OF GENERIC SETTINGS NOW OF ALL TIMES. There were so many other series that aired before this that was way more generic, and i don't see people going on about that?\\n\r\nAs for the JC Staff hate on adapting this Little Busters, and wanting KyoAni to pick up this adaption, here is a powerful and deep quote for you guys:\\n\r\n=========================\\n\r\n\"What dawned on me recently about Little Busters was that despite the premise of Riki building a baseball team via harem creation, the real focus on the show is not romance, but actually friendship, despite the Key label.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that answers many questions I had behind LB and its production.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026It is this focus on friendship by the LB source material that it is well-loved by fans, and why JC Staff picked it up, and why, like you, I find it so charming and comforting.\"\\n\r\n -Slashe@from a blog on lostinanime.com\\n\r\n=========================\\n\r\n\u279f \"HIGH EXPECTATIONS THROUGH IMAGINATION\"\\n\r\n...It's like what everyone always says: You WILL not be able to satisfy everyone since they all have different tastes and expectations. If it's not your type of anime, if you don't like Key animes, if you hate LB!'s comedy, sequence of plot or pacing, then you don't have to \"bark\" so loudly about how bad it is.\\n\r\n-For the visual novel players, it's an ANIME so obviously they will leave out many things that aren't deeply or specifically relevant to the plot. If they leave out a favorite scene of yours then find an another scene that the producers DID animate and is already giving you.\\n\r\n-For anime viewers, DON'T USE YOUR IMAGINATION on what you want to happen, or have expected this and that just because it's a popular anime right off the bat (no matter how many times I need to repeat this, i'll say it over and over, THE ANIME IS STILL AIRING), ...and compare it to the anime, because it will ruin your enjoyment on what the anime is already giving and portraying for you.\\n\\n\r\n\u279f \"WHY SHOULD I WATCH THIS ANIME?\" \\n\r\nI will also include the anime's traits and argumental downsides (negatives/cons of the anime that many people whined/complained about) to give new viewers a fair reason to watch this anime if they're looking for one. If you love animes with slow paces continuing to build up to the climax (LIKE CLANNAD (THE FIRST SEASON), STEINS;GATE, AND POSSIBLY MADOKA MAGICA), that goes by a omnibus format, then this anime is perfect for you. \\n\r\nI am aware that there are people out there who:\\n\r\n-hate this anime's moe-tification. (but some look forward to it and adore it)\\n\r\n-hate this anime because of the (again) slow pace, because it bores you. (but some enjoy the atmosphere and (again) the slow build-up tension giving you the mysterious feeling of anxiety to the climax)\\n\r\n-hate the cast of character's personalities, you must be one hell of a intolerant person. (but other's can connect with those characters whether it's because of their personality, or experiences)\\n\r\n-hate random panty shots. (Some don't mind nor care. Seriously, will a non-ecchi anime showing a SINGLE panty shot (or two) kill you?)\\n\r\n-hate the character's voices and/or VAs. (The voices are completely normal, and fine, many including myself love it because it fit's their personalities so stop barking so loudly about the voices.. and stop using Komari's voice as an excuse to drop it, you just havent watched enough anime to hear worse VA's. Komari's a popular character so you might be killed if you start hating about the voice outside of MAL). There is actually another popular heroine or two that actually has the same VA as Komari's, true fact and true story.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude this review, if any of you ever go on assuming baseless facts about the plot, or questioning the idea of the anime and it's current setting without clearly knowing the entire story, and the reasons why each character is acting that way when the anime is STILL CURRENTLY airing/have yet to be completed. Then YOU are a narrow-minded person blindly looking for a reason to hate for your own satisfaction and unmet expectations (like those people who thinks an anime that contains 'hentai' in it's title would actually 100% contain it...)\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this very unrefined review :)\\n\\n\r\nNow for my current rating for this anime:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10 \\n\r\n-Good pace, not consistent enough but it improved as it continued pretty drastically. Seems like the staff couldn't get a better team together for the beginning because of the budget, which the current halfway point is quite the opposite now.\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\n-Art is pretty, moe is cute, animation was bad but it apparently improved as the anime continued. Seems like the budget of Little Busters was reversed from lowest to highest.\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\n-Beautiful, melancholic music, very memorable.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\n-Seemed simple at first sight, but it seemed I was wrong and that the characters could be more double-sided and dynamic than I expected. The cast is full of many different personalities. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\n-My enjoyment is going up the bar since the beginning of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.6/10\\n\\n\r\n~ End ~",

To people who know absolutely nothing about the original work (like my self), the first 5-6 episodes are seemingly worthless.\r\nThe characters presented in this anime thus far have been the most cookie cutter, generic, run of the mill characters, and they make each episode more painful than the last due to their utter lack of character development.  A muscle head, unbelievably weak and annoying main character, an aloof carefree vagabond, a painfully 'shy' character that  if separated from her childhood friendswould probably find a dark ally to sit in and make ear piercing, siren-like whining sounds until she expired because she is simply \"too  shy\" to receive help from any stranger, and finally an airhead who doesn't have the strength to lift a baseball bat.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are on par with other series from this day in age, again, a very generic location for the setting of the story and animation by JC Staff does not help this anime's cause by any stretch of the imagination.\\n\\n\r\nThe story lacks any trace of a gripping or even remotely worthwhile plot; every aspect of the story thus far has played out numerous times in other senselessly generic anime series. \\n\\n\r\nI don't think there is much more to say about this series.  If you enjoy slice of life anime that lack any sort of character development and a generic storyline with sprinkles of fan service, then this series is for you; otherwise you would be wise to pass on it.",

            "content": "There are many things in this world that can break a person's heart. Whether it's a tragedy, a memory, a breakup, a betrayal, or just because, these things can affect an individual's well being beyond repair. It's not like a physical injury where the wound heals. It's emotional and affect's a person's heart. Once that's damaged, it can be very difficult or in many cases, become unhealable. Luckily though, there are ways to go through this process. \r\nFor starters, friends are probably one of the best medicines. In fact, friends are one of the most valuable things that should be treasured in this world. It'snot purchased at your local grocery store. It can't be collected like baseball cards. It can't be earned like points from a video game. Rather, a friend is a someone who looks after your well being and someone that you hold mutual affection for. When you're having a bad day, they are there for you and someone who can understand the situation. Through friendship comes forth a connection as people learn more about each other and more about themselves. If you look back through those memories and your photo albums, you might remember some of those memories of childhood. These memories that are built with your friends are irreplaceable and as long as you treasure them, nothing can take that away. With these friends, you learn to climb the stairs to adolescence through experiences while learning about the world. You know what that's called?\\n\\n\r\nIt's called growing up.\\n\\n\r\nAt last it's here! Fan of the popular Little Busters visual novel have always dreamed the possibility of an anime adaptation. Now, that dream has become a reality. The long awaited LB visual novel has become an anime series. The series is handed by J.C. Staff (Toradora! Sakurasou Pet no Kanojo, Hatsukoi Limited) who are already known for their high school settings involving students in a lighthearted environment in a zone of drama, comedy, romance, and emotions. Now, this could cause some mixed feelings for people especially for die-heard fans coming from the visual novel. In fact, the visual novel released in 2007 became ranked second for national PC game pre-orders in Japan as well as holding the number one top seller spot that summer. The polls set up later that year also gave the franchise a strong impression in all categories with the exception of visuals in terms of its rankings. This may all sound impressive but can the anime series live up the hype? Can Little Busters gives the fans what they want and deserve? Or rather, how can it be appealing to the fans (both VN players and anime original fans)? Is it worth watching? These may all be questions some people may wonder about. Well, let us find out what Little Busters offers from its anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the series is based off of a Key's work. They are known to bring viewers to tears with their strong emotional dialogue, visuals, and the soundtrack to present them in a way that is heartwarming. In fact, their previous works such as Air, Kanon, and Clannad (with its sequel Clannad After Story) all accomplished this in some way or form that have left a strong impression of emotions to fans. In this adaptation though, there seems to be a bit of lacking in that department. In fact, this series seem to shift more into the department of comedy rather than emotional appeal. Well, let's get to the part later but this is my original impression on the series after its first episodes.\\n\\n\r\nLB takes place at a high school in Japan. From there on, we have Riki Naoe, the main protagonist of the series. He is a ordinary boy with nothing much to stand out with his features; the girlish look, expressions, weak build that can sometimes can be mistaken as a trap when dressed in a specific way. Furthermore, he has a sad past that we can call a tragedy considering the death of his parents when he was young. He also suffers from a case of narcolepsy, where he suffers from a lack of sleep. Yet at the same time, we can see that Riki is a very kind boy who is gentle and has a tendency to help others in need. As fate calls for it, Riki is helping to recruit others with his group of friends known as the Little Busters. \\n\\n\r\nThe team has it all. \\n\\n\r\nWe have the muscle and hotheaded member of the group - Masato Inohara. He is a roommate of Riki and a devoted friend of his. Often known for his quick anger and strange ideas, Masato is seen as loyal and sometimes a little bit too enthusiastic with things related to his friends and himself. We have Kengo Miyazawa whose loyalty is unmatched by anyone in terms of devotion to the team. His skills in kendo is one to be feared coupled with his personality. Then, there's Kyousuke Natsume who is known as the leader of the team. He is seen as the senpai (because he is older) and often has a head of strange ideas that can be abnormal. Yet, it is clear that Kyousake has the guts and skills to be the leader for his ways of thinking and loyalty. Now, that's just the boys side. Let's get to the \u2026.*ahem* better part: the ladies of the team.\\n\\n\r\nThe main female protagonist in the series is Kyousuke's little sister, Rin Natsume. She is seen as a timid girl with weak social skills and often or not, hangs out with cats which is she highly fond of. Despite this, she is skilled with pitching and values the friends as well as the experiences she shares with her friends. Then we have the more childish girl Komari who is often seen as a clumsy little kid but often makes a fun impression on the viewers with her expressions and gags. Behind that image though lies a dark past, one which has left a trail of pain and sorrow. In one episode, it even caused her to go into a state of shock just based on that painful memory. \\n\\n\r\nOn the more serious side, there is Mio Nishizono, a calm girl who maintains a mature and reserved personality. Being a book lover, she often likes to read rather than hanging out with friends. Her parsol hides more than just her appearance as like others, she also has an interesting past that is explored later on. Likewise, we also have the more mature girl (and one of my personal favorites) Yuiko Kurugaya. Although the same age as others, she is seen as the older sister type with a replica of the katana for showing off her extra features. Despite being mischievous and almost a trickster at times, she knows when someone needs help and offers it without a second thought.\\n\\n\r\nBy this point now, a viewer can see the many characters of the series and get a good idea of their various personalities. I mean, LB has it all in terms of characteristics \u2013 the hotheaded guy, the mature oniisama, the cute little mascot, the shy cat-loving girl, the normal boy who has a not-so normal health, and the leader who brings them all together. However, the problem lies in some of their characters being one-dimensional. The high school outfits most of the characters wear are also a bit generic in the sense that they don't stand out much. Except perhaps the school council president, most of the characters hardly cares about the way they are dressed at school. It is amusing at the same time though to watch what they do with the team especially out on the field together. \\n\\n\r\nDespite some of the action presented in the form of duels at school, the series often leans more towards the comedy department. From the first episode, we can see that the duels themselves has little serious risk on the line besides the bragging rights and earning an embarrassing name (lol). At often times, these duels are portrayed as being over the top humorous with the objects involved. The duels themselves are also often cliched and has no typical strategy involved. I have not played the visual novel but from this anime adaptation, it seems to try way too hard and at times too random. It works out at times but at other cases just seems too purposeless and unreasonable. \\n\\n\r\nBecause the series also takes place at high school, expect the common themes such as joining a club, making friends, relieving past memories, being school disciplined, and drama. Speaking of which, the series does occasionally pull itself through with the drama presented. J.C. Staff is known for some of their series that progresses drama in sequences. In Little Busters, it follows a similar fashion but only in arcs. The series itself takes these arcs and pinpoints individual characters who gets their highlights. In other words, it doesn't follow the usual linear storyline. Rather, it focuses on a more progressive character direction that is driven by LB's themes. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the series suffers a number of problems that may be hard to redeem itself. The series often tries way too hard with its drama. In fact, one could call it as almost being artificially crafted from the the characters' development themselves. To add on more to that injury, there hardly is any development because some of the arcs either does one of the following: moves too slow or rushes it way too fast. It doesn't balance it together well. In fact, even some of the emotions portrayed in the various arcs lacks real passion with a weak feeling of realism. As there are even some filler episodes, the series lacks a true progression to fit material to be adapted.  Then, there's the problem with the romance aspect of the show. For some reason, I cannot get into the feeling of romance into this at all. In fact, I hardly notice it being present because the show seems to focus far too much on comedy. Not to mention that, the moe like features, expressions, and sometimes random gags seems to become a distraction. \\n\\n\r\nThen, there is a problem with adaptation. I have not played the original visual novel game even though it has a huge fan base. From the various comments, feedback, and other sources, the series seems to suffer a case of this especially involved with \u201cthings that should be there but aren't\u201d. It's hard to meet everyone's expectations especially with a caliber of a series such as Little Busters but from an objective standpoint, that's not an excuse. J.C. Staff has a history of adaptations \u2013 some which transformed into a revolution while others dropped the ball. From the viewpoint of an anime-only viewer, I will say that J.C. Staff pulled off an alright adaptation. However, based on some technical backgrounds, the series just pulls way too many comedy with not enough what the fans actually may want. It's a bit of a disappointment but I guess we always can't get everything we want. To me though, this looked like a buildup to a greater medium. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of Little Busters comes together like a picture frame on a wall. It fits right but probably not all the way through especially in some of the earlier episodes. It does have its appealing imagery though especially with expressions on some of the characters' faces during various reaction scenes. For more of the fun factors, there is the moe incidences of some of the younger characters. The series adapts these scenes to seemingly give a lighthearted outlook because the series has a more pleasant feeling of fun and high school comedy. At other incidences though, there are serious scenes and even emotions especially in one of the later arcs. The background artwork seems only mediocre though and nothing seems to stand out. Along with the school uniforms, the series keeps itself with its generic designs.\\n\\n\r\nAs for music/soundtrack, the series maintains its composure of that lighthearted melody. Jun Maeda orchestrates the rhythms for the series whom is already known for his other works such as Air, Clannad, and Kanon. In general, I found the overall tone of the soundtrack to be above mediocre but not too unique. Most of the OST is lighthearted with a soft paced tone. Although beautiful and melancholic at many variances, it seems to be a bit repetitive and ultimately becomes somewhat overbearing in various scenes. It's almost as if the music is on repeat. The OP song, Little Busters! by Rita depicts the team members from the series formed by friendship, connections, and unity. It also shows some expressions from various characters that can be seen as melancholic or out of this world. (especially for Riki's case) The ED song follows a similar suit.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Little Busters is a charming little gem but occasionally loses its shine. By the way it portrays itself, the series suffers flaws from pacing, direction, a seemingly weak adaptation coupled with some edgy artwork problems. The series also misdirects and fails to bring emotions from what fans expected from the characters themselves. It's not pleasing when you realize that something so emotional can zoom so fast right through. The series does make its way with good comedy though and its colorful cast of characters. Along with that, LB brings for a heartwarming feeling to viewers especially when you're looking for something lighthearted to watch. The characters themselves forms the team known as Little Busters (the title of the anime itself) and with that, they walk down a future of dreams and friendship; at least for now.",

            "content": "To all you Key and Little Busters! VN fans out there, at least have the courtesy to read this before you down vote it. If you're a sucker for tons of melodrama and cute girls, by all means watch this. If you're the latter, read on.\r\nAnyways, the moment I watched a character cry over her favorite park bench being destroyed, I finally gave up after struggling through 15 episodes of this anime. No matter how much I wanted to love this, I couldn't. And since this anime has 8 and 9 reviews as its top reviews, I'm going to shed some light on this animeso people won't waste their time with this.\\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, I have not played the VN. If this was seriously true to the VN, then that's great for all you VN fans who have been waiting for this. If I have a nostalgic feeling for something, I also can be subjective to favoritism and like things more than I should. However, in this review, I will be treating the anime and VN as different entities and therefore make this an anime only review.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I start off, this is my personal opinion and only my personal opinion, so I'm not trying to say that I've watched every great masterpiece out there and know what \"true\" masterpieces are. I honesty have a high enjoyment factor with most things, so low ratings are rare for me. \\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters! desperately tries to combine sports, slice of life, melodrama, comedy, and a whole array of concepts, and to be quite frank, it doesn't work at all. Our main character Riki is your \"I had a terrible past as a child\" type of deal but quickly made friends with a group known as the \"Little Busters\" that helped him through his tragic times. Riki is essentially as bland as you can get. He's weak, indecisive, but when girls are in trouble, he'll magically gains confidence and become a legendary savior. Yeah, one of those guys. Anyway, the group has some pretty interesting characters that weren't all that bad, however, things pretty much go downhill from there.\\n\\n\r\nFast forwarding to high school, The group all decide to recruit baseball players to form some baseball team that later on becomes almost non-important, but that's beside the point. So this \"baseball\" team basically gives our MC Riki an excuse to walk around campus and talk to random girls, because obviously a manly baseball team would suck. And you guessed it! He definitely picks up quite the amount of females. Your female cast that is slowly introduced is your typical bland, generic, \"I've seen this stuff too many times to care\" type of deal. We have the perfect cool beauty, the short little adorable girl who shouts \"wafu!\", your silent, unemotional bookworm, blahblabhalbh\\n\\n\r\nAnd sure enough, each of these females has some terrible awful past that totally seems out of place. Now we suddenly shift from recruiting baseball members into a full blown melodramatic case involving unbelievable sob stories complete with cheesy Key production supernatural twists. Riki, being our main character, is obviously devoted to helping all these females out with the best of his abilities, and of course, he always manages to fix everything. And in the end, they all go back to playing baseball and happy story all over again.\\n\\n\r\nOh right, and there's also some major important \"secret of the world\" plot while all of this goes on, but after 15 episodes, all we know is these secrets are notes tied to cats. Yeah. cats. And the slips say your generic ambiguous \"what the hell does this even mean\" quotes that in the end, you honestly don't care about this secret of the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is at best, mediocre. Gags get repetitive and used over and over. Most of the comedy is focused on the muscles freak Masato, who is always losing in fights due to his stupidity and getting himself in silly situations. Our little adorable character Kud offers some Engrish and adorableness that isn't exactly innovative, but still provided a few bright spots here and there. Riki gets himself involved in all sorts of situations with the ladies, and Rin becomes catlike and scared of people who try to befriend her. Besides the fact, these happy carefree episodes in between the serious dramatic episodes feel really awkward and out of place. I admit that one cooking episode was fun to watch, and was  probably my favorite episode out of the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nSo what did we get in the end? Generic characters, generic and cheesy melodrama, decent and overused comedy, and some random ass baseball theme behind all of it. What am I suppose to like? The dramatic scene of a student council president breaking a school bench? The slice of life elements, even though they don't associate with anything SLIGHTLY related to school besides their baseball team?\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to like this so much, which is why I watched up until half of episode 16. But I really can't take this anymore. The execution is terrible and I'm just going to play the VN and not waste my time. Thanks for reading, and please comment on my profile so I can improve my future reviews.",

            "content": "You probably have heard a lot of things about Little Busters, ranging from \"This is an adaptation from masterpiece VN!\", \"J.C staff actually did a good job\", \"It's totally inferior to the VN\" to \"This is an absolute trash!\".\r\nNow, If you're confused about this polar reactions, then I think I should say that... Yes, Little Busters! is a very different anime every time you change your own mindset about it. That's why I think we need a technical review a bit early so you can probably guess the overall quality of Little Busters!, or probably just to see another point of view about it.\r\nSo, beforewe get to the real question, \"Is Little Busters! a good anime?\", let me clarify things about my own position :\\n\r\n- I have played some routes of Little Busters! VN, but nothing beyond what anime viewers currently watch...except of Rin 1 (Rin's \"fake\" route), which only told one spoiler material (which is not really hard to be guessed for now anyway)\\n\r\n- As a result of that situation, I can only judge Little Busters! from the anime-only viewers view point. However, having seen Rin 1 made me realize something about the future of Little Busters! story:\\n\\n\r\n\"This sh*t hides a lot of things behind it's carefree atmosphere.\"\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nThis review is composed by \"THE GOOD THINGS\" and \"THE BAD THINGS\" about Little Busters! TV animation. I will try to keep myself objective as an anime viewer only, but with some awareness about the general direction of the future story.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nWe could say that Little Busters! is composed by three main components :\\n\r\n- Common route materials : Slice of life materials with carefree and silly atmosphere. Serves as introduction and development episodes for the characters. Also, some of them are introduction for \"Secret of the world\", the main plot behind all of Little Busters! story. And baseball.\\n\r\n- Heroine route materials : At the first glance, it's generic KEY melodrama. Most of the story materials are related to each heroine's past, and of course they are going to end with \"Everything is fine\" happy ending.\\n\r\nRight, right?\\n\r\n...\\n\r\n- And then that's when Refrain, the main route of Little Busters will hit the fans. It reveals the \"Secret of the world\" which is always hinted at the entire part of Little Busters.\\n\\n\r\nTHE GOOD :\\n\r\nRefrain is claimed by many as Jun Maeda's peak of career as a writer, and generally it's a consensus that without Refrain, Little Busters! is nothing sort of special.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I know. Refrain is not here yet. There's also a possibility that Refrain won't deliver as well as people claim to be, especially since it's under JC Staff's helm now. BUT knowing that there's something huge called Refrain and the so called \"Secret of The World\" probably could change your view point about the common route and heroine route episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty hard to talk about this without go into details, but one thing for sure \"There are a ton of clues that you can find in the series regarding 'Secret of The World'\". It also  connects a lot of seemingly random materials into one unity. Little Busters! scriptwriter also did a good job at incorporating them into very limited episodes, so kudos for that.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about character arcs, they are actually kinda decent. They are composed by a lot of themes, ranging from a simple symbolical story about memories to a complex story that involving astronauts, rebellion, life-death situation and magic in one package! However, they aren't without their glaring flaws...\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD :\\n\r\nIndividually, Little Busters! current story is pretty weak, mostly caused by amateurish direction and grade EX adaptation difficulty of original material. Little Busters! original material also had an obvious weakness : Although LB is a clever concept, it has a lot of writers which resulting in a lot of quality inconsistency in each of heroine routes.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other flaws : LB humor generally is very... silly and may turn some people off (although it's pretty funny and lovely if you gave it a chance to grow in you). LB also has a pretty disappointing route as the first route, since it's kinda sacrificed so people can see a sort of drama without waiting for 10++ episodes before some real drama starts. Some people are also complaining about the lack of \"feels\" in Little Busters!. It's a valid complain, although I have to say that some of them are coming from unrealistic expectation that they will cry at the first arcs of Little Busters. Folks, they were never meant as the primary power of Little Busters!, just like every other KEY works. Also, I have seen plenty of teary confessions from some watchers, so I think it's not anywhere as bad as people suggest.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION : 7. Individually it's only decent at best, but it has a lot of potential to be great later.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nTHE BAD :\\n\r\nJ.C Staff weren't remembered for great art quality, and Little Busters! isn't even a good example of J.C Staff animation works.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of \"QUALITY\" shots, strange usage of effects, strange expressions, etc... Just to name a lot of homework that needs to be improved for the next season. To worsen things, KEY usually was related to Kyoto Animation, which caused a high expectation of KEY works in terms of art quality.\\n\\n\r\nTHE GOOD :\\n\r\nHowever, they also did a good job at times, especially at some nature shots (although it's nowhere close to KyoAni quality). I think most people also have no problem with the character design, which is kinda similar to Na-Ga design(The man behind Angel Beats and half of Little Busters character design. One thing for sure, it will turn less people off compared to traditional KEY character design. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion : 6. Decent at times, but generally are quite bad. At least it has a pretty good character design.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nMUSIC\\n\r\nTHE GOOD : KEY are widely known as a company that incorporate amazing music to support it's emotional punches, and Little Busters is not an exception to that.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters! opening also known as one of the best KEY vocal OST, and it's remixed (again) for the TV series! Alicemagic, the ED song, is also a great song, probably even better than the pre-remixed version. Generally, they are not only serves as a good song musically, but they also give a lot of hints about the overall story of Little Busters!\\n\\n\r\nVoice works are decent. However, they will be tested at Refrain, when they were expected to show a wider scale of emotions. I think we have to wait until then to fully score their performance.\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD : The music director simply needs to be fired. Also, some people may be turned off by some character voices (ex : Komari).\\n\\n\r\nConclusion : 7. Good songs, bad direction.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nTHE GOOD : This is one of the part when Little Busters! shines.\\n\\n\r\nMany people claim Little Busters! as a group of \"uninteresting and stereotype characters\". In contrary to that, I can safely say that it's a premature judgement and they should peek a bit deeper into their characteristics.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters! original cast are unusual, for the starter : 4 boys and one girl, that's something that people expect from some girl-oriented visual novel. At the first glance, they are composed by various roles, including the \"leader\", \"normal person\", \"the idiot\", \"the cool boy\", and a... \"cat obsessed girl?\". It doesn't seem special at first, but tell me any work which is composed by similar composition (Especially for a show that dig more into male demography). I know that even finding an example would be hard.\\n\\n\r\nAt the deeper analysis, it's getting more unique. The main character, Riki, is pretty much an ordinary boy at the first glance, but there's something really unique in his \"normal\" behaviors. Simply said, he didn't act as a main character of an anime, and I find it's really refreshing. And he even hid a lot of mysteries behind his usual daily life, something which probably he didn't realize for now.\\n\\n\r\nThe main heroine, Rin, is also an odd example. \"Cat loving girl\" alone wouldn't be unique, but I find her anti-social behaviors are anything but normal for a main heroine of a romance series (not to add that it's really different from usual anti-social characters, which is usually portrayed as a loner/very silent). But that alone won't make her special. Her subtle, slow but sure developments are what made her a lovable character, since she actually grows rapidly along the story progression, even though she haven't even got her own route yet!\\n\\n\r\nWe probably haven't learned much about the rest of the boys. Kyousuke for sure is charismatic, but for now we can only tell that he hides a lot of secret behind him. We barely know anything about kengo for now, and Masato is a... lovely muscle idiot. But, don't worry. They will have their own spotlight later, and it's also a grand one.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the rest of the (girl) casts? They are really varied, and most of them are having good qualities behind their seemingly-generic attitude. Kud, for example, bashed a lot for being a \"lovable Wafu~ mascot\", but behind that she also hides a lot of characteristics. For example, She's actually really smart. One of her favorite theory is many-world interpretation theory, and she actually can solve some conceptual physic problems on her own. To compensate, she also had a lot of problems on trivial things, and she actually has a severe case of confidence problem. Now, what part of her is generic, again?\\n\\n\r\nAnd all of those qualities aren't even the main power of Little Busters! characters. Their main power are their own chemistry. This is the part when they really shine, when they slowly growing together as a group of a really tight-knotted good friends, and it will only getting better as the series evolving.\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD :\\n\r\nToo bad, to see their real potential, you have to invest for a lot of episodes before they grown in your heart. You will also have a polar impressions about some of the heroines, although most likely you will like all of the original members of Little Busters!... which is barely even scratched for now.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion : 8. IMHO it's the main power of Little Busters! If you don't like them, probably it's your own loss.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nTHE GOOD :\\n\r\nNow, this is a serious question... \"Is watching Little Busters an enjoyable experience\"?\\n\\n\r\nI personally will answer with \"yes\". It requires some patience to wait for the group to grow, but most of the time it worth the wait. The best part of the story haven't even come yet for now, but it's already progressing pretty fast since they already thrown a lot of more noticeable clues regarding \"the secret of the world\". Some of the routes also have potentials to bring plenty of FEEL, although they aren't really exceptional for now.\\n\\n\r\nLike what I have said before, the 2/3 early part of Little Busters! are only serving as an introduction for the real story. I don't want to sound like a broken machine, but there are different nature of stories. This is the series where you can't judge the arcs individually. They are meant to be rated as a whole series.\\n\\n\r\nIt may be not as great as what you expect initially, but one thing for sure : It's a common consensus that Refrain is definitely better than the rest of the routes, since it tying the entire story into one unity of a story called \"Little Busters!\".\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD :\\n\r\nIt requiring patience from you, so it won't be enjoyable for those who don't even want to wait for that. Of course, there's no guarantee that you WILL enjoy it even if you are following them with patience, so I think you could just drop the series if the first +- 14 episodes aren't fitting to your taste.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion : 7. It most likely will worth the wait, although there's also a good probability that it just doesn't fit to your taste from the very beginning.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nGENERAL CONCLUSION : 7.\\n\\n\r\nJ.C staff's adaptation turns out to be better than what everyone expect at the beginning. Sure, many will disagree with me, but there are a lot of people that enjoy Little Busters as it is right now. There is a myth that only blind VN players who are supporting this adaptation right now, but it turns out that many of LB fans are... newcomers. So, the only way to found out about your opinion toward this adaptation is by trying it by yourself.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it's a very hit or miss story. The story as for now probably isn't a masterpiece by any means, but it has a potential to be. Nobody know for sure if the rumored \"Refrain\" will be a success or not, but in my opinion they have laid a pretty solid stage as the foundation.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you're still unsure about this, just wait until Season 2 comes out. You won't miss the news if they manage to deliver Refrain brilliantly, and if it's the contrary, you can safely ignore the entire series.",

Another great anime created by Key, so far after watching the first three episodes it has certainly lived up to my expectations.\r\nIf you have played the VN(visual novel) of little busters, you will surely not be disappointed in the anime, the anime does a brilliant job on adapting from the VN, the characters and music are identical to the VN.\r\nThe story so far is really similar to the VN which is fantastic to know that the anime will be like the VN, so for those that are wondering what the story is about\r\n--------------SPOILER ALERT!!!---------------\r\nIt is about a boy named Riki that suffers froma disease that caused him to have sleep attacks occasionally. When Riki was a child his parents died which left him homeless and depressed but a group of kids called little busters reached out to him and let him join the group of friends. Since then he has been inseparable to that group. \\n\r\n--------------SPOILER END---------------------\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has done a great job in capturing the character just like they are in VN and even though you haven't played the VN, you will love the characters easily.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the anime is exactly like the music in the VN which is always a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the characters looks better in the anime than in the VN the characters such as komari seems a lot more cuter in the anime which is a plus :D\\n\\n\r\nOverall Little busters! is a great adaptation of the VN so far and hopefully it shall continue to be like the VN. Anyone that loved the VN will certainly love the anime so far and even though you haven't played the VN it will provide a really good first impression as it is a great slice of life anime which really nice story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nP.S - sorry for the large usage of the word VN XD",

Since Kyo-ani did a good job with Clannad Air Angel Beats and Kanon, you know they Key (Maeda) line up. But from what I have seen so far, J.C. delivered.\r\nLittle Busters! is a Key Visual Novel scripted by the Jun Maeda we all know love and hate. And it isn't like most of the visual novel adaptations. It simply can't be, it's too well known, the references are very firmly imprinted in the readers' minds. And in this, Ibelieve J.C. has done well.\\n\\n\r\nMusic, Little Busters! is a very good song and I am very happy, I AM VERY HAPPY they kept a remix version of that song as the opening, same for Alicemagic for the ED, it's staying true and appealing to the veteran readers. I can watch the anime hear the song and remember the VN. It's a very cool feeling. The same can be said for the BGM in the anime, those are OST tracks directly from the VN and can allow a veteran reader to refer to the awesome moments in the VN that the scene is corresponding to.\\n\\n\r\nPlot, so far it is accurate, to some degree, There were some cool \\n\r\ngags skipped or shortened but that as anime time allotted goes, is to be expected.\\n\\n\r\nIt'll be interesting to see how the rest of the plot is written in seeing how Little Busters! plot looks like a storyboarding nightmare and you literarily require several play through to beat it, with plot information added during each different play through.\\n\\n\r\nWe'll see, but for now I love the show. It appeals a lot to us veteran readers. so far I don't think I would mind J.C. Staff doing Rewrite. we'll see",

            "content": "Last Edited : 4 Feb, 2013\r\n--NOTE--\r\nFirst of all, Little Busters! is still Airing. So this review is based on how many episodes i've been watching. So for people who hate someone who reviews the anime when it stills Airing. Please, we just want to 'guide' some people who hasn't watch the anime yet. So that they can tell whether it is a perfect anime for them or not based on episodes that have been aired. And note that i will edit and update this review till the anime finished airing. Though, for now i will be tallk more on comparison between the anime andthe VN.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters! or LB for short is an anime that adapted from VN. If u know Clannad, Air, or Kanon (Key Trio) this is another great VN from Key. It tells a story about Naoe Riki whose father and mother were dead when he stills a kid. Spend his remaining day in sorrow and sadness, comes 4 kid that pretended to be called \"Little Busters\". Sadness that always been tailing Naoe now has gone because they comes to his life. And so they still spend time together in High school...\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's for the synopsis. The story itself is great (in VN). As expected from Key. As for anime, good news that J.C.staff really adapted the story carefully. Although, the time frame looks different from the VN. And a lot of scene from the original story (VN) is edited or deleted here and there (Clannad too, but managed to be as great as the vn). Lets hope that J.C.Staff had a good reason for this. As for me, i really enjoyed the pace of the story. It likes when i'm watching Clannad. Slow and Entertaining. Lots of Comedy here. But anyway some part funnier in the VN though. An example is the old man Kojirou's screaming. Back in the VN i was laughing for 5 minutes or so when Riki comes to his rooms and he Scream like hell, too funny. In anime? a little boring.. But now i get it, Little Busters is a tale of friendship and adolescence. So, maybe they focus more on LB Team Friendship than a comedy, though the comedy now gettin' better. And of course for the drama too.\\n\\n\r\nArt.... i must say that the art... is average. Yeah right it is colorful and the background is beautiful. And the character face.. looks similiar from the original VN. Great. Too bad it looks pale. But now J.C.Staff seemed put more effort on this anime. The animation got better and better. Good news for fans. And keep this up J.C.Staff!\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, the animation style looks similiar to KyoAni's. So for people who love Clannad and K-on! Art, you will love it too. Plus, if you are a moe seeker, enjoy the ultimate moe in Little Busters. Although, some people hate the extensive moe in Little Busters.\\n\\n\r\nKomari \"Fuueee..\"\\n\r\nNggghhhhh!\\n\\n\r\nKud \"wafuuuu~\"\\n\r\nNGGGGHHHH!!!\\n\\n\r\nBut.... there are random panty shoots in Little Busters. Too bad, if it can be like Clannad (no panty shoots) it will be perfect, i think...\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening \"Little Busters\" is great. Just great! I believe people sing along the opening when they watch Little Busters. Best Opening so far in my opinion for Key's anime. And to be honest, i played the VN because i saw the intro in youtube and love the song LOL. And for the ending, again its the best Ending for Keys VN (and Anime). Although the BGM is not that great.. the best BGM will be Clannad i think, Little busters BGM, is good, just average. Good news that J.C.staff used an unused track in the VN. And its good.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now character. You know Characters from Keys always seem interesting.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the main male, Naoe Riki. I love his character, really. Clumsy but can be cool sometimes. Always picked up by Kurugaya. Has a baby face. So long, he's alright. Just, in Komari's Arc when Komari fell to depression, how can he be that calm? It seems that he has this in his mind, \"Ah next episode Komari's Arc ended so everything will be alright.\" \\n\r\nFeel unnatural there. But, later on, he matured a little by little. As he and the teams always work together to solve the teams or individual problems.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now Rin, she is the main male (right?). To be Honest, among all the girls, she is my favorite. Dont know why but her shyness is just cute. And i like her when she kicks Kuzu, ahh i mean Masato LOL. And i was \"NGGGHHH\" when she played with the cats. Moooeee.....\\n\r\nBut i feel like crying when she cried and hug Komari when her Arc ended, sweets.. And she get many char development till now (episode 17). Good thing that the development easy to notice so thats the viewers can feel the development and the character deeper.\\n\\n\r\nKyousuke, i just LOL'ed. All he did was almost out of place. Like creating a battle game that use a random weapon. And the way he test someone who want to join Little Busters team, LOL. Clannad funny because there are Sunohara, Little Busters funny because there are Kyousuke and Kuzu ahh i mean Masato.. Kinniku Yay Yay~ But sadly, in the first few episodes, he shines so much, bring the heavy content comedy to the viewers. But the comedy content that he (with Masato and Kengo) brings now decreased little by little.\\n\\n\r\nFor people who read the VN. Maybe you will notice that some characters seems different (personality). That because J.C.Staff edited some scene from the VN as we have talked before. But in exchange of edited scene, they added more friendship themes on this anime. Its now brings the viewers more about how LB team communicate with each other. It, for me is a great thing. As you know that, in VN, especially romance genre, when the story (of each arc) is near the end, its only about the main protagonist and the main heroine in the arc. It just the lovey dovey couple. But J.C.Staff didn't do that in the adaption. Because they want to show more the relationship of each member of LB!. They want to show more the Friendship among the members. Which is great.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters is a funny and (will be) heartwarming anime this season. I have high hopes for this anime. Although its too bad KyoAni break a contract with Key to animate Little Busters. But its alright if J.C.Staff can keep up the good work, as we know the quality of the anime has increased. And Little busters! reached 2nd place together with Chuunibyou (Yes, KyoAni's anime) in the \"Most Popular Fall 2012 anime\" polling with 1060 votes while the 1st place (Sword Art Online) is 1082 votes. So, J.C.Staff did their best to produce this anime so that it can rivaled the KyoAni's anime : Chuunibyou.\\n\\n\r\nSo for people who complaining :\\n\\n\r\n- Why it is J.C.Staff who produce Little Busters! not KyoAni ?\\n\r\n- The anime is slow-paced\\n\r\n- Why it has a lot of Moe here and there?\\n\r\n- I hate the voice of She/ He\\n\r\n- I hate the personalities of His/ Her\\n\\n\r\nWell, first. As we know from above, Little Busters! managed to get the 2nd place in the polling. Meaning that J.C.Staff is doing their best. And don't forget that J.C.Staff has a lot of great anime that they produce : Toradora, Sakurasou (still Airing), Shakugan no Shana, Ano Natsu de Matteru, Azumanga, Bakuman series and many more. So believe and enjoy their hard work.\\n\\n\r\nYou hate Moe? Can't say much, its your taste. But i believe, Animes that adapted from Key's VN (And Jun Maeda is the story creator) always had a extensive Moe-ness, slow paced, and the same comedy-style. Clannad, Air, Kanon is another example. So maybe Key requested that their VN adapted anime must be like that. You know the remake of Kanon by KyoAni? That happened because Key unsatisfied with the Kanon 2012 version (the predecessor of kanon 2006 by KyoAni). Maybe the 2012 version : didnt have Moe?, too fast-paced (13 episodes). Clannad, Air and Kanon is high rated despite that they have moe-tification, slow-paced. If Little Busters follow their Senpai, i think it will be success too and satisfy the viewers. Which is great right?\\n\\n\r\nAs for people who hates some of seiyuus or some personalities (maybe changed a little from the VN), as we know, although J.C.Staff changed a bit of scene in order for friendship themes cause but despite that, they put an effort to keep the originals being kept if possible. So they have to keep the original seiyuus from the VN although some of them didnt satisfy you. However, some characters suffer a seiyuu changes, because of some reason. Example : Nishizono Mio.\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you understand those, hopes that you now can view Little Busters! differently = free of doubts. So that u can enjoy the show to their fullest. But of course i respect personal opinion and taste. After all i wrote this review so that you can decide whether this anime is for you or not. Not to urge you to watch it no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the closing, i enjoy this anime very much. Enjoyment = 9. For people who love Slice of life or Drama and love a heartwarming tale with comedy. And love the friendship themes but alright with the ultimate moe-ness and slow paced (KEY VN adapted anime styles) , Little busters is for you. Do watch it.",

            "content": "I review: Little Busters \r\n           AND\r\n Little Busters - Refrain\r\n(I am comboing them because I marathon'd them together.)\r\nIf you were looking for romance, it isn't here. It is more about friendship than anything. If you are a romance lover, it doesn't matter, because the story being told is so damn good.\r\nAlrght so, I started Little Busters when it was coming out weekly. It had a slow start, and I didn't find it that entertaining for me for some reason. The first girl's story was kinda lackluster. I then stopped watching Little Busters at around episode9, because I thought it was bullshit. After both seasons became finished, I decided to give it another shot (because I ran out of anime).\\n\\n\r\nThe humor of the show isn't as funny until the characters grow on you, then it becomes frikin' hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, some of the girls were really annoying, but as they grew on me, I started loving them. They aren't the cookie cutter pasted girls that I thought they once were. \\n\\n\r\nAs usual, each girl has a hidden problem, and boy were some of their stories REALLY out there. \\n\\n\r\nI come across the supernatural. There is this under-laying supernatural theme going on. \\n\r\nOne big, giant, supernatural theme. The show has this big mystery behind everything. All the girl's problems that have been solved, wasn't just forgotten like how some harems do. It ties in perfectly. This big mysterious supernatural theme is what kept me going and watching, and getting excited every time I was given a new clue. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character, as I thought, was just one of those super nice to everyone, goody-two-shoes boy. Well, he still is, but the fact that he is that for a reason makes it all the better. Everything that this show has given us, they give us a reason. They explain it, and you will believe it. \\n\\n\r\nNever before have I seen a harem show that ACTUALLY focuses on other MALE characters. The male characters have a deeper story than any of the girls, because it ties in with EVERYTHING.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is good. When they want you to feel, they will make you feel. I don't quite remember it as much as I do with Clannad or Toradora's sad music, but it still gets the job done.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good enough. I don't remember any spectacular things about it, but they do show a good amount of movement, walking, and running. \\n\\n\r\nNOW FOR LITTLE BUSTERS - REFRAIN\\n\\n\r\nBrace yourself. Everything you just watched in the first show was only just build up. Refrain will take EVERYTHING you have just watched, and do something amazing with it. I could say the same thing that went for Clannad; The first show was just build up for Afterstory.\\n\\n\r\nJust sit back, and enjoy the long journey you earned: By watching Refrain.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL, I give Little Busters an 8, and Little Busters Refrain a 9. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is best for marathoning (which I did) and was glad that I didn't have to wait weekly. Then I wouldn't have had the chain effect.",

            "content": "Coming from a person that has no idea what, \"Little Busters!\" is, I felt the need to write a review since the majority of people watching this are also new to the series. When I first heard of the show it seemed like some glorified anime that should be put on a pedestal. Unfortunately, it is not.\r\nTo start off, the story seems awkward. A group of students decide to create a baseball team because it's their leader's last year before graduating? Original yes, but it seems bland and pointless. However, I have heard and read some discussion that the plot thickens and gets extremely emotionbut until then, it gets a 4. \\n\\n\r\nNext, the art. I want to say that it's amazing and really nice to look at but I can't. It looks the same as anime from a few years back so it's nothing unique or amazing when compared to some other anime. However, budget must be taken into account when it comes to this so I'll be flexible here. Art gets a 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound plays a crucial part in anime and for \"Little Busters!\" the sound is good. It's not horribly bad but at the same time, not amazingly good. It's neutral. The OP is catchy and the ED is pretty generic in my book but it's a good formula so I can see why they stuck with it. Overall, sound gets a 7.\\n\\n\r\nNow comes character. In most animes characters play an important part. In Little Busters, it feels as if the characters are blobs and nothing more. There's a generic muscle head, samurai, impulsive leader, shy girl, moeblob, etc. We've all seen them before. The main character, Naoe, who's voice I cannot stand is pretty much a sissy that's diagnosed with Narcolepsy. We find out that his parents died and he becomes isolated which is a nice back story since he's the only character that actually gets one. In the end, characters could be better but for now, it gets a 6.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, it all boils down to enjoyment and whether one actually has fun when watching the anime. I will give this a good score because even if there's no real story, or amazing art, or enchanting sounds, or great character development. As long as I enjoy the anime, I'll continue watching, and \"Little Busters\" does just that. It's fun to watch since they have a good sense of comedy and the characters are all likable. So this gets a 8 here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, \"Little Busters\" seems to foreshadow a deeper plot that we have not seen yet as they are mostly just introducing the characters to us right now so until we get further into the show, it gets a 5/10 for now.",

            "content": "Little Busters!\r\nIf you're like me and you're thinking about watching this because the visual novel was made by Key, don't. Watch it with an independent mindset, free of Clannad, Kanon, etc. If you don't you're just gonna find disappointment.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story was definitely not as good as Key's previous works. Yes, it followed the general plot of a high school boy helping multiple girls cope and effectively saving their lives in one way or the other, but it simply was not as engaging. There were many story elements that  could have been left out. For example, Riki's narcolepsy. So what? It did not influencethe progression of the story whatsoever. There was also no romantic interest, but the friendships gained throughout the series filled in the hole nicely for those who don't mind the absence of romance. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs expected, it was beautifully animated. No complaints. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music lacked variety. There was probably one tune that played in every emotional scene throughout the show. Variety is always good when the anime is only about friendship and nothing else is going on. Otherwise the show becomes drab very quickly. Also, the female voices were THE MOST annoying I have ever heard. I was relieved when Kurugaya would speak as she was the only normal sounding female voice in the series. This anime is not for people who detest whimpering, crybaby voice work that sounds like Asian porn.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were good with each having his/her own unique personalities. Each fought their own battles, emerging as victorious, developed characters. They were funny when they were supposed to be, and emotional when it was expected. However, I could not get around how they acted like 5 year olds throughout the whole show. If the producers were aiming for a moe approach, they definitely failed. I saw nothing cute in these characters at all. Maybe it's because i'm not into that stuff. But panty shots of bears and ducks on teenage girls aren't really my thing. I found it awkward and completely unnecessary to the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was definitely not as enjoyable as I thought it would be. Towards the middle of the season, I was struggling to keep watching. I have a policy to watch an anime all the way through once I reach a certain point, so there was no going back. The story was boring and the characters were annoying. As usual, Key was aiming for an emotional tale that would grip our hearts and make us feel the pain the characters felt but this simply was not the case this time. It was just, meh. I would recommend this like I would recommend SAO: I wouldn't. Unless you like mediocre anime that relies solely on fan service to get viewers. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you just finished Clannad and want to watch another one of Key's visual novels animated, do yourself a favor and skip this one and watch Angel Beats or something instead. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a second season titled \"Little Busters: Refrain\" and i'm going to be watching it when it airs toward the end of 2013.  Who knows? Maybe it will pull an \"Afterstory\" on us and crush our hearts to bits before an amazing ending. Hopefully it isn't as painful to watch as Season 1 was. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "There is one thing I can say about this show \"Under-Rated\"!\r\nThis show has been treated as quite \"generic\" and too \"slice-of-life\". I say to those people \"You obviously haven't watched the damn thing\"! This anime is exactly what you'd expect from a Key anime, very emotional. A lot of the scenario's in this show are pretty unique and are something you really DON'T expect. \r\nStory: 8\r\nSo it's about a group of friends that decide to form a baseball team as a way to enjoy their last year together, seeing as Kyousuke, the one who essentially holds the group together, will be graduation soon. This issort of just an excuse to bring together all the characters, like the Drama Club in Clannad. The main MEAT of this story is \"the secret of the world\". Now, I'm going to look at this from an anime viewer's point of view (I have indeed played the VN), this plot point is quite interesting. Riki and childhood friend Rin receive a letter telling them that they must complete a number of tasks to discover the secret of the world. As the anime goes on, this plot point becomes much more interesting with plenty of hinting and foreshadowing, especially in the most recent episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nAlthough I like the art in this anime, I have to say that it loses points due to poor animation in some of the earlier episodes. Some of it is WAY too noticable and just leaves a bit of a poor taste in my mouth. But the episodes that do have good animation, are REALLY good. Episode 14 for example looks absolutely fantastic and if every episode was like that then I'd easily give the art a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Little Busters is great. It perfectly fits the show and the emotion in it. It's also just well composed overall. The only problem I have is some of the placement with the songs with some times. The sound director seems to like playing a track for like 5 seconds and then changing it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are great and lovable. Every character isn't 2-dimensional. They have all have a personality that stands out, they have very interesting ways of talking (such as certain characters having a certain phrase or word that they commonly use such as \"Wafu!\" with the character Kud and \"Kiniku! (Muscles)\" with Masato) and along with that, they all develop in interesting ways and have some pretty tear-jerking backstories.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoy this show, and if it goes the same way as the VN does, it will DEFINITELY become my favourite anime. The comedy is fairly funny (although gets a little repetitive at times), the drama is well done for the most part and it's really just a huge variety of emotions which makes it really interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nOverall, it's a good anime, worth a watch and with the way they're going currently and me knowing where the story goes later, this anime looks to be very promising and could probably get into the top 15 animes by the end of it's second season.\\n",

As of episode 8 , little busters is just a silly slice of life comedy series, and a mediocre one at that. \r\ncharacters\r\nwell this where the animeitself is completely annoying. all of the chacarters are just plain boring, but what i hate the most are the voice actressess for komari (and some other girls), i can\u00bft stand it, and i have read some people actually dropped the anime because of that, well now i see why. people say there are worse but fortunately i havne't run into them.\\n\r\nmusic is fine, and i like the OP and Ed songs.\\n\r\nin the end, maybe i'm just biased because i hate a lot of thing the anime presents: slow pacing, overused jokes, annoying voice actressess and female characters mostly, a lot of moe (not for me),\\n\r\n thanks for reading\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "At first I thought this show was about baseball and let it slip by fast. Then I found out it was not and decided to give it a try. I regret it.\r\nAfter having watched the first 6 episodes the anime was seriously below my expectations. Alas I read on the forums here that it gets better after about the 7th episode or so. So I pressed on. A waste of time, I tell you, I should've just dropped it right there and moved on to something that I could actually enjoy.\r\nThe anime suffers from bad story setup and lots of filler moments. What I meanby the latter is moments that really had no reason to be in the anime except to prolong it. Little Busters could be told in 12 episodes in a way that it would be actually interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIn it's current state, however, it was boring. It was so boring that I sometimes just left it playing in the background in small screen with \"always on top turned\" on and turned my attention elsewhere or even played music to make the experience at least a little bit bearable. I wanted to watch it all to give an accurate review.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the story, sure, there were some good moments or ideas but I've watched even worse anime that had those. Most of it was the usual stuff you could see coming from a mile away and when things actually got interesting for a moment, it was all ruined with a bad conclusion which either was very simple (but somehow still needed Riki's help) or it was solved with magic (as in - that's the way thing are, don't ask questions). Especially horrid was the 23rd episode. Just goes to show that no it doesn't get better after the 7th episode, it's just as bad till the end. However, it does make you think that it'll get better.\\n\\n\r\nSoundwise, the BGM was forgettable, the OP and ED poor, or not my style, whichever you prefer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were interesting (generally) for a brief moment when it was their time to shine (their arc) but after that they became generic and dull characters yet again. The two huge guy friends were at times especially painful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art being good is the only thing that saves this anime from an even worse score. That and cute voice acting. This anime might have the cutest \"moe noises\" ever. The most interesting part was actually the ending but with the disappointment that is Little Busters, I doubt I'm going to want to watch the second season.\\n\r\nWafuu~ and skip this anime.",

            "content": "First things first, Little Busters has the theme and genre of (in ascending order of importance): Comedy, Romance, slice of life, drama and friendship. Also, I will give a special mention to tearjerkiness. Of course, this means that this anime will be for those who enjoy these themes. Those who do not may not like it.\r\nNow, personally I believe a review should be written once the show has finished but I felt the need to write one down without the rankings being biased towards the visual novel and one which is written by someone who enjoys the above mentioned themes of this anime. Though takein account that my ranking system may be much more lenient than others so I will give a range of points which may seem appropriate. (of course, towards the people who find interest in this genre)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis will be a review based on what is going on so far. However I will also write about certain advancements of themes in general in the hopes to allow people to understand that what is shown now is not going to stay the same for the remaining of the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8 (+1, -2)\\n\r\nSo far, it follows an average slice of life theme where the main characters do what a high school students do best, mess around and have fun. However, there are hints of something strange throughout the revealed episode and also some drama developments. Both the gags and drama however, are dependent to a person. Some of it will appeal to you while some will not. Gags and drama will always be hit or miss. Personally, I felt these were well done since they managed to pull a out of laughs and jerked a few tears out of me.\\n\\n\r\nFuture insight- This slice of life theme is a way to get viewers to get to know the characters. The feeling of strangeness will develop into something big. There will be a wide variety of drama so if the first one does not appeal to you, then the next may.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7 (+2,-2)\\n\r\nOne thing which can be easily seen so far is that the animators have split their budget to make the art vary a lot. The casual slice of life and comedy scenes will not seem too well done but on the other hand, the drama scenes had beautiful art which allows the characters emotions to be felt. The art style is close to those of angel beats but quality does differ.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8(+2, -1)\\n\r\nThe music is reused from the original Little Busters visual novel. The opening and ending songs have both been slightly changed to make it more upbeat which makes it more catchy and interesting. These songs are really good and have meaningful lyrics. The OST in the anime is also very good however, at times it is not used appropriately at the beginning of the show. This issue has improved since then. The soundtrack is also fitting to the mood in the anime. Happy and cheerful scenes is lightened more with bright music while the sad scenes have there tension and heavy feel increased by melancholic music. \\n\\n\r\nFuture insight- Some of the most beautiful songs and soundtracks have yet to appear. These are really something to look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:8(+1,-3)\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are undeniably common archetypes. We have an air head, moe character, a cool big sister type, a shy girl and a trouble maker as the female roles. These archetypes are also exaggerated a lot which effectively allows each character to stand unique from each other. This exaggeration also makes their interactions give a warm and fuzzy vibe. For the male roles, we have a muscle sidekick, a weak protagonist, a cool leader, and a kendo user. The interactions of the male creates a large sense of friendship when they help each other and when they screw around. However sometimes the interactions are taken a bit too far which lessens the impact.\\n\\n\r\nFuture insight- It will depend on a person whether they enjoy these characters or not. Some people may not like these cliche characters but what makes these characters unique from ones in other cliche animes is that most of the characters background is explored in their own drama scenes later. A quiet girl has yet to make her appearance.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8 (varies too much)\\n\r\nI can only speak for myself here since everyone will find this different. I found the gags and slice of life scenes heart warming and uplifting. They bring a good smile to my face. The drama impacted quite a bit to me which allowed me to empathise with characters so far.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8 (+1,-2)\\n\r\nLittle Busters, although has a lot of room for improvement, is decently shown right now and has great potential for some very deep drama once you can connect with the characters. The theme of friendship has been portrayed very well when the music, characters and story comes together.  There was not a moment so far where I would feel bored.",

            "content": "(Please read the Review before saying its not helpful just by the score. because you never know what might happen, you might actually change your mind!! ... which is impossible .. eh at least read the review before bashing) and there might be some minor spoilers. but no biggy :DD\r\nNow that I finished this anime I can finally give it a proper review. Did I love Little Busters? OF COURSE I DID. I always had my doubts that somehow in the end the anime wont satisfy me, because it started slow and I thought that it wouldn't be true the the Original visual novel, andme thinking that the whole series will just be finished in 26 episodes wasn't helping at all... But I was wrong because there is a season 2, and that made me really happy.\\n\\n\r\nNow before I start the review lets state some facts. Little Busters! is originally a Visual Novel Developed by Key, The company that makes awesomely amazing series that would probably make the manliest man on earth cry, and I was never disappointing in any of their work . And here I can easily say that Little Busters! is my favorite Key series ( and I played/watched all of Key's Titles!! O.O )\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nSo the main story revolves around this kid named \"Naoe Riki\" who is in high school.. enjoying the school life and just hanging with his childhood friends (Rin, Masato and kengo)... you know high school stuff. But all this changes when his friend Kyouske comes back from Tokyo and suddenly decides to create a baseball team by the name of \"Little busters!\" (weeh shcokerz!). So from there on they give Riki the mission of finding other members to join the team, and that is how our main character meets the other 5 girls, they join the team and they all become this cutey big family. So the story progresses like most Key titles with Riki listening to the other girls problems and help them solve what ever is on their minds, sounds fair enough right? well here is where it gets tricky, aside of all that Riki and Rin keep reviving these mysterious messages stating that there is a secret of the world they live in, and they have to figure out what that secret is, Riki and Rin start receiving different tasks that moves them closer to the answer. Now I don't wanna spoil anything, but I can say that the secret of the world is reaaaaaaally jaw dropping and ... just shocking (in a good way), it changes the whole view of the series.\\n\\n\r\n Ok so was season 1 good and true to the visual novel? for me the answer is yes, because now that I finished season 1 I can tell where the developers were going when they made it. The main point of this season is to show us the characters in the best way possible, to let us explore the world of Little Busters! to let us see the characters such as Riki and Rin develop. They didn't rush the anime, they didn't go into the serious part, and they saved all that for season 2 (Refrain) which is a pretty good move because now we have seen all the characters, we know exactly who they are, we some them develop, now in Refrain we can relate more to them and understand them much better.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI have to be honest here, as much as I loved the anime .. I have to say that the art wasn't that amazing, It was a bit weird ... I am not sure what exactly was wrong with it, but i didn't like it as much as the Visual Novel's.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI think the character design is a major positive point in Little busters! because the characters were just amazing, at first you might see them a bit bland.. and a tad silly, but as you proceed in the series you will discover how awesome they are. Every character is unique and has his/her special design and his/her own awesome personality. All of them are lovable, I myself loved each and every character, and I think they are one of the most unique characters of any series i watched.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nWhen has Key ever made bad music. The music is just freaking hawt!! ahm excuse me I just loved the soundtrack... so anyway, you might not notice the background music that much in the anime because its an anime, and you don't really focus on the music in an anime as much as when you are reading a visual novel. But the anime did use the same OST and all of them were used perfectly and they all fit the moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was good. Great at times and just Ok at other times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo if I want to compare the anime with the original Visual Novel then I can just say that it was true to it. even though it skipped some small details here and there, but the anime was quite long, 26 episodes I think that's enough to explain the main story of the series and introduce the characters and the comedy was awwwesome :DD. All that aside the anime did have some changes that I quite loved and weren't in the VN. such as showing that some of the characters know what the secret of the world is, which builds up a really strong impact towards them. And I also loved the story Komari wrote about the The boy and girl helping the 8 dwarfs, I thought that was a really nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah.. All I can say is that I loved Little Busters! even if I didn't read the visual novel I am pretty sure I would have loved it as well. A lot of people are bashing the anime even fans of the visual novel... I think these people should just chill and enjoy the wonderful world of Little Busters! :3",

Its not lousy, ive seen plenty worse, but it could have beenmuch better.\\n\r\nSound: 10- The voice acting here i think is very well done, all the characters except for mio have the same VA from the visual novel, but mio's replacement did a fine job. Also the Opening is amazing, the ending is as well, the soundtrack themes are one of the best soundtracks ive ever heard as well.\\n\r\nCharacters: 10- All the main and supporting characters are unique in their own way, from the eccentric Haruka, the childish Komari, the mature Kurugaya, the mysterious mio, and all of the original members of the Little Busters are all likeable and unique characters.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10- While quite a few episodes were quite sad and emotional(In particular Haruka and Mio's arcs, as well as the last 3 episodes) their were plenty of bright and lighthearted moments as well, i couldn't have enjoyed it more.\\n\r\nOverall: 10- Little Busters is an anime that doesn't come around every day, it truly is special and in my honest opinion a real masterpiece\\n\r\n:)",

            "content": "Over the past decade, visual novel studio 'Key' has seen much success for their work on titles such as Kanon, Clannad and Air. If you have watched or read any of these series, you will likely be familiar with Jun Maeda's distinctive form of dramatic storytelling. \r\nDo not expect another Clannad: After Story. You will not find it here. \r\nAt first glance, there is one startling difference in Key's latest adaptation. It is not animated by Kyoto Animation, the studio responsible for handling the majority of Key adaptations. Instead, the esteemed and beloved (not really) J.C. Staff is at the helm. For many this isa name that will undoubtedly be a cause for concern. In Little Busters, it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the misadventures of Riki and his four childhood friends. Set during the leader Kyousuke's final year in high school, the group of friends decide to make something of their remaining youth- not by overtly rebelling, but by practicing and playing baseball together. They cannot form a team with only five members though, which is why Riki and Rin are set to recruit more people from their school. Preferably females, as Rin is the only young lady in the group. \\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters' cast of characters is its strongest trait. No\u2014 not because they are especially well-written or unique, but because they are endearing- because they are entertaining. It isn't easy to make a group of anime characters feel like genuine friends with one another, but Little Busters manages to achieve this feat with its wonderful group dynamic. Even the later members contribute to the show in a significant and believable way. The characters truly do make the lighthearted segments a joy to watch. \\n\\n\r\nBeing part comedy, it's a good thing that the jokes are often fresh and clever. Of particular note is Masato. If you remember Sunohara from Clannad, he is a bit like that. Masato and all his muscular glory (and utter lack of brain cells) are the cause for many jokes. Usually at his expense. And usually met with a kick to the face from Rin. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame, since any appeal the show has is frequently pushed aside in favour of cringeworthy melodrama. The individual character routes were not very good in the visual novel and they are most certainly not any good here either. It would be one thing if these arcs were merely mediocre, but with J.C. Staff's lack of directorial talent they are made absolutely dreadful. The omnibus format also does little to help the rushed pacing, resulting in a format that feels highly formulaic and superfluous. One of the girls has troubles, Riki helps them to overcome it, one or two episodes of comedy follow\u2014 repeat, repeat. Thankfully the lighthearted segments are so entertaining, as otherwise you would probably detest each character by the end of their route. It is that bad at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe two worst offenders are Mio's and Haruka's routes. In Mio's route, the viewer is treated with illogical and contradictory character actions further complimented by a hilariously contrived deception on the writer's part. Plotholes? Everywhere. And it does not even attempt to answer them with anything besides equivocation. The climax could maybe be explained if the characters were taking psychedelic drugs at the time, but looking at it from a realistic perspective it does not make any sense whatsoever. Watching Utena may be less confusing. \\n\\n\r\nHaruka's route will also make you want to scream in frustration. Her tragic backstory is implausible (why the hell were the people taking care of her not convicted of abuse?) and the motivations of the antagonist, Kanata, are silly at best. The rest of the route is comprised of more cheap plot twists and embarrassingly cliche melodrama. Heck, there's even a scene where the weather changes from sunshine to storm as soon as Haruka starts crying. How much more cheesy can you get? Little Busters seems to experiment with the limits. \\n\\n\r\nThings do improve, though. After a decent start and two terrible arcs, the last third of the story provides a satisfying d\u00e9nouement showing how each of the characters have grown over the course of the series. The last episode in particular is quite nice, with the long-awaited baseball game being played in high spirits. Some might argue that this improvement is too little too late. They might be right.\\n\\n\r\nOne area where Little Busters does not disappoint is with its soundtrack. There may not be anything on the same level of \"Dango Kazoku\" to mess with your emotions, but the soundtrack as a whole is solid and surprisingly memorable. Then again, it's pretty hard to make mistakes when you are deriving almost all music from the source material.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters' endearing characters are complimented by a highly talented cast of seiyuu. Yui Horie provides a convincing role for a male character (though does little to make Riki any less bland) while Masato's seiyuu does a wonderful job at delivering the comedy. Rin and Kud on the other hand will probably kill your heart from how adorable they sound. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to praise about the art, but it certainly isn't bad. Just average. Just middling. For a TV anime it is passable, but when comparing it to previous Key adaptations you will definitely notice a significant drop in quality. Off-model faces are frequent and many scenes are reduced to panning and 'talking heads': devoid of any animation besides the character's mouth flapping. For an adaptation of one of the most successful visual novels, you would normally expect the artwork to at least be above-average. Not here. \\n\\n\r\nAs an adaptation, it is worth mentioning how it compares to the source material. Is it a bad adaptation? It is. If you want to experience the story as it is intended, it would be in your best interests to give the visual novel a read instead. On its own merits and as a condensed version of the story, however, J.C. Staff's adaptation is merely passable. It doesn't completely butcher the story but with the rushed pacing, poor characterization (especially with regards to Riki), lackluster art and incomplete story\u2014 most of the charm that made the visual novel so beloved is nonexistent here. At least there's more cute Rin scenes, though! Maybe that is the one and only good thing.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters will not be winning any awards for its writing or production qualities, but when taken as an entertaining comedy with likable characters, it is at least worth a watch. Putting aside the expectations, you will certainly find some enjoyment in Key's latest animated venture.  \\n\\n\r\nHopefully, too, J.C. Staff won't let us down too much in the sequel. I can think of few things that would be more disastrous.",

            "content": "This will be a temporarily review until the anime is completed, I created this so that people won't get any misunderstandings from others UNTIL the technical reviewers come by when the anime is completed. I've also decided to create this review for the sake of those viewers who played the visual novel, and for those who havent since I'm tired of reading all these reviews made up of self-satisfaction, and sadly by biased and unperceptive views.\r\n\u279f \"COMPARISONS AND BASELESS ASSUMPTIONS\"\r\nFirst to those who played the visual novel, please stop comparing the visual novel to the anime, they are done on completely different ways and isdifferent on a fundamental level. So please don't use the visual novel's high standings as an EXCUSE that the anime will be the same. Using 'because it's a Key story' as a reason to watch [is a different matter though*], given that the same person wrote the same scenario as the whole of Clannad (and other various animes adapted from Key's work) is a plus and a good reason to watch this anime.\\n\r\nSecond to those who are only here for the anime, please stop talking like you know everything about the anime when you have not completed the story yet (the anime is still AIRING). The slow pacing is not an excuse, many animes had slow pacing (not just for the first few episodes, it can even be over half the series) yet in the near end was seen to be praised very highly removing all those doubts for the beginning of the anime. I do not want to see people making such assumptions. As for the massive hype to you anime viewers, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A SOLE REASON AS TO WHY IT IS HYPED, DO NOT ASSUME NONSENSE and overlap it with the anime's weakpoints or disabilities. \\n\\n\r\n\u279f \"CYNICISM AND SINCERITY\" \\n\r\nGeneric? I will not use this as an excuse but give this anime a break, the visual novel was created in 2007, though it was after Clannad, it's not a surprise there will be some generic settings and characters in this anime. Actually not everyone gets tired of these sorts of things, but those who do get tired... if you can overlook that, then go for it and watch it especially for the romance, drama and Key magic given. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GIVING A DAMN ABOUT THE REPETITIVE USE OF GENERIC SETTINGS NOW OF ALL TIMES. There were so many other series that aired before this that was way more generic, and i don't see people going on about that?\\n\r\nAs for the JC Staff hate on adapting this Little Busters, and wanting KyoAni to pick up this adaption, here is a powerful and deep quote for you guys:\\n\r\n=========================\\n\r\n\"What dawned on me recently about Little Busters was that despite the premise of Riki building a baseball team via harem creation, the real focus on the show is not romance, but actually friendship, despite the Key label.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that answers many questions I had behind LB and its production.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026It is this focus on friendship by the LB source material that it is well-loved by fans, and why JC Staff picked it up, and why, like you, I find it so charming and comforting.\"\\n\r\n -Slashe@from a blog on lostinanime.com\\n\r\n=========================\\n\r\n\u279f \"HIGH EXPECTATIONS THROUGH IMAGINATION\"\\n\r\n...It's like what everyone always says: You WILL not be able to satisfy everyone since they all have different tastes and expectations. If it's not your type of anime, if you don't like Key animes, if you hate LB!'s comedy, sequence of plot or pacing, then you don't have to \"bark\" so loudly about how bad it is.\\n\r\n-For the visual novel players, it's an ANIME so obviously they will leave out many things that aren't deeply or specifically relevant to the plot. If they leave out a favorite scene of yours then find an another scene that the producers DID animate and is already giving you.\\n\r\n-For anime viewers, DON'T USE YOUR IMAGINATION on what you want to happen, or have expected this and that just because it's a popular anime right off the bat (no matter how many times I need to repeat this, i'll say it over and over, THE ANIME IS STILL AIRING), ...and compare it to the anime, because it will ruin your enjoyment on what the anime is already giving and portraying for you.\\n\\n\r\n\u279f \"WHY SHOULD I WATCH THIS ANIME?\" \\n\r\nI will also include the anime's traits and argumental downsides (negatives/cons of the anime that many people whined/complained about) to give new viewers a fair reason to watch this anime if they're looking for one. If you love animes with slow paces continuing to build up to the climax (LIKE CLANNAD (THE FIRST SEASON), STEINS;GATE, AND POSSIBLY MADOKA MAGICA), that goes by a omnibus format, then this anime is perfect for you. \\n\r\nI am aware that there are people out there who:\\n\r\n-hate this anime's moe-tification. (but some look forward to it and adore it)\\n\r\n-hate this anime because of the (again) slow pace, because it bores you. (but some enjoy the atmosphere and (again) the slow build-up tension giving you the mysterious feeling of anxiety to the climax)\\n\r\n-hate the cast of character's personalities, you must be one hell of a intolerant person. (but other's can connect with those characters whether it's because of their personality, or experiences)\\n\r\n-hate random panty shots. (Some don't mind nor care. Seriously, will a non-ecchi anime showing a SINGLE panty shot (or two) kill you?)\\n\r\n-hate the character's voices and/or VAs. (The voices are completely normal, and fine, many including myself love it because it fit's their personalities so stop barking so loudly about the voices.. and stop using Komari's voice as an excuse to drop it, you just havent watched enough anime to hear worse VA's. Komari's a popular character so you might be killed if you start hating about the voice outside of MAL). There is actually another popular heroine or two that actually has the same VA as Komari's, true fact and true story.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude this review, if any of you ever go on assuming baseless facts about the plot, or questioning the idea of the anime and it's current setting without clearly knowing the entire story, and the reasons why each character is acting that way when the anime is STILL CURRENTLY airing/have yet to be completed. Then YOU are a narrow-minded person blindly looking for a reason to hate for your own satisfaction and unmet expectations (like those people who thinks an anime that contains 'hentai' in it's title would actually 100% contain it...)\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this very unrefined review :)\\n\\n\r\nNow for my current rating for this anime:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10 \\n\r\n-Good pace, not consistent enough but it improved as it continued pretty drastically. Seems like the staff couldn't get a better team together for the beginning because of the budget, which the current halfway point is quite the opposite now.\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\n-Art is pretty, moe is cute, animation was bad but it apparently improved as the anime continued. Seems like the budget of Little Busters was reversed from lowest to highest.\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\n-Beautiful, melancholic music, very memorable.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\n-Seemed simple at first sight, but it seemed I was wrong and that the characters could be more double-sided and dynamic than I expected. The cast is full of many different personalities. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\n-My enjoyment is going up the bar since the beginning of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.6/10\\n\\n\r\n~ End ~",

To people who know absolutely nothing about the original work (like my self), the first 5-6 episodes are seemingly worthless.\r\nThe characters presented in this anime thus far have been the most cookie cutter, generic, run of the mill characters, and they make each episode more painful than the last due to their utter lack of character development.  A muscle head, unbelievably weak and annoying main character, an aloof carefree vagabond, a painfully 'shy' character that  if separated from her childhood friendswould probably find a dark ally to sit in and make ear piercing, siren-like whining sounds until she expired because she is simply \"too  shy\" to receive help from any stranger, and finally an airhead who doesn't have the strength to lift a baseball bat.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are on par with other series from this day in age, again, a very generic location for the setting of the story and animation by JC Staff does not help this anime's cause by any stretch of the imagination.\\n\\n\r\nThe story lacks any trace of a gripping or even remotely worthwhile plot; every aspect of the story thus far has played out numerous times in other senselessly generic anime series. \\n\\n\r\nI don't think there is much more to say about this series.  If you enjoy slice of life anime that lack any sort of character development and a generic storyline with sprinkles of fan service, then this series is for you; otherwise you would be wise to pass on it.",

            "content": "There are many things in this world that can break a person's heart. Whether it's a tragedy, a memory, a breakup, a betrayal, or just because, these things can affect an individual's well being beyond repair. It's not like a physical injury where the wound heals. It's emotional and affect's a person's heart. Once that's damaged, it can be very difficult or in many cases, become unhealable. Luckily though, there are ways to go through this process. \r\nFor starters, friends are probably one of the best medicines. In fact, friends are one of the most valuable things that should be treasured in this world. It'snot purchased at your local grocery store. It can't be collected like baseball cards. It can't be earned like points from a video game. Rather, a friend is a someone who looks after your well being and someone that you hold mutual affection for. When you're having a bad day, they are there for you and someone who can understand the situation. Through friendship comes forth a connection as people learn more about each other and more about themselves. If you look back through those memories and your photo albums, you might remember some of those memories of childhood. These memories that are built with your friends are irreplaceable and as long as you treasure them, nothing can take that away. With these friends, you learn to climb the stairs to adolescence through experiences while learning about the world. You know what that's called?\\n\\n\r\nIt's called growing up.\\n\\n\r\nAt last it's here! Fan of the popular Little Busters visual novel have always dreamed the possibility of an anime adaptation. Now, that dream has become a reality. The long awaited LB visual novel has become an anime series. The series is handed by J.C. Staff (Toradora! Sakurasou Pet no Kanojo, Hatsukoi Limited) who are already known for their high school settings involving students in a lighthearted environment in a zone of drama, comedy, romance, and emotions. Now, this could cause some mixed feelings for people especially for die-heard fans coming from the visual novel. In fact, the visual novel released in 2007 became ranked second for national PC game pre-orders in Japan as well as holding the number one top seller spot that summer. The polls set up later that year also gave the franchise a strong impression in all categories with the exception of visuals in terms of its rankings. This may all sound impressive but can the anime series live up the hype? Can Little Busters gives the fans what they want and deserve? Or rather, how can it be appealing to the fans (both VN players and anime original fans)? Is it worth watching? These may all be questions some people may wonder about. Well, let us find out what Little Busters offers from its anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the series is based off of a Key's work. They are known to bring viewers to tears with their strong emotional dialogue, visuals, and the soundtrack to present them in a way that is heartwarming. In fact, their previous works such as Air, Kanon, and Clannad (with its sequel Clannad After Story) all accomplished this in some way or form that have left a strong impression of emotions to fans. In this adaptation though, there seems to be a bit of lacking in that department. In fact, this series seem to shift more into the department of comedy rather than emotional appeal. Well, let's get to the part later but this is my original impression on the series after its first episodes.\\n\\n\r\nLB takes place at a high school in Japan. From there on, we have Riki Naoe, the main protagonist of the series. He is a ordinary boy with nothing much to stand out with his features; the girlish look, expressions, weak build that can sometimes can be mistaken as a trap when dressed in a specific way. Furthermore, he has a sad past that we can call a tragedy considering the death of his parents when he was young. He also suffers from a case of narcolepsy, where he suffers from a lack of sleep. Yet at the same time, we can see that Riki is a very kind boy who is gentle and has a tendency to help others in need. As fate calls for it, Riki is helping to recruit others with his group of friends known as the Little Busters. \\n\\n\r\nThe team has it all. \\n\\n\r\nWe have the muscle and hotheaded member of the group - Masato Inohara. He is a roommate of Riki and a devoted friend of his. Often known for his quick anger and strange ideas, Masato is seen as loyal and sometimes a little bit too enthusiastic with things related to his friends and himself. We have Kengo Miyazawa whose loyalty is unmatched by anyone in terms of devotion to the team. His skills in kendo is one to be feared coupled with his personality. Then, there's Kyousuke Natsume who is known as the leader of the team. He is seen as the senpai (because he is older) and often has a head of strange ideas that can be abnormal. Yet, it is clear that Kyousake has the guts and skills to be the leader for his ways of thinking and loyalty. Now, that's just the boys side. Let's get to the \u2026.*ahem* better part: the ladies of the team.\\n\\n\r\nThe main female protagonist in the series is Kyousuke's little sister, Rin Natsume. She is seen as a timid girl with weak social skills and often or not, hangs out with cats which is she highly fond of. Despite this, she is skilled with pitching and values the friends as well as the experiences she shares with her friends. Then we have the more childish girl Komari who is often seen as a clumsy little kid but often makes a fun impression on the viewers with her expressions and gags. Behind that image though lies a dark past, one which has left a trail of pain and sorrow. In one episode, it even caused her to go into a state of shock just based on that painful memory. \\n\\n\r\nOn the more serious side, there is Mio Nishizono, a calm girl who maintains a mature and reserved personality. Being a book lover, she often likes to read rather than hanging out with friends. Her parsol hides more than just her appearance as like others, she also has an interesting past that is explored later on. Likewise, we also have the more mature girl (and one of my personal favorites) Yuiko Kurugaya. Although the same age as others, she is seen as the older sister type with a replica of the katana for showing off her extra features. Despite being mischievous and almost a trickster at times, she knows when someone needs help and offers it without a second thought.\\n\\n\r\nBy this point now, a viewer can see the many characters of the series and get a good idea of their various personalities. I mean, LB has it all in terms of characteristics \u2013 the hotheaded guy, the mature oniisama, the cute little mascot, the shy cat-loving girl, the normal boy who has a not-so normal health, and the leader who brings them all together. However, the problem lies in some of their characters being one-dimensional. The high school outfits most of the characters wear are also a bit generic in the sense that they don't stand out much. Except perhaps the school council president, most of the characters hardly cares about the way they are dressed at school. It is amusing at the same time though to watch what they do with the team especially out on the field together. \\n\\n\r\nDespite some of the action presented in the form of duels at school, the series often leans more towards the comedy department. From the first episode, we can see that the duels themselves has little serious risk on the line besides the bragging rights and earning an embarrassing name (lol). At often times, these duels are portrayed as being over the top humorous with the objects involved. The duels themselves are also often cliched and has no typical strategy involved. I have not played the visual novel but from this anime adaptation, it seems to try way too hard and at times too random. It works out at times but at other cases just seems too purposeless and unreasonable. \\n\\n\r\nBecause the series also takes place at high school, expect the common themes such as joining a club, making friends, relieving past memories, being school disciplined, and drama. Speaking of which, the series does occasionally pull itself through with the drama presented. J.C. Staff is known for some of their series that progresses drama in sequences. In Little Busters, it follows a similar fashion but only in arcs. The series itself takes these arcs and pinpoints individual characters who gets their highlights. In other words, it doesn't follow the usual linear storyline. Rather, it focuses on a more progressive character direction that is driven by LB's themes. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the series suffers a number of problems that may be hard to redeem itself. The series often tries way too hard with its drama. In fact, one could call it as almost being artificially crafted from the the characters' development themselves. To add on more to that injury, there hardly is any development because some of the arcs either does one of the following: moves too slow or rushes it way too fast. It doesn't balance it together well. In fact, even some of the emotions portrayed in the various arcs lacks real passion with a weak feeling of realism. As there are even some filler episodes, the series lacks a true progression to fit material to be adapted.  Then, there's the problem with the romance aspect of the show. For some reason, I cannot get into the feeling of romance into this at all. In fact, I hardly notice it being present because the show seems to focus far too much on comedy. Not to mention that, the moe like features, expressions, and sometimes random gags seems to become a distraction. \\n\\n\r\nThen, there is a problem with adaptation. I have not played the original visual novel game even though it has a huge fan base. From the various comments, feedback, and other sources, the series seems to suffer a case of this especially involved with \u201cthings that should be there but aren't\u201d. It's hard to meet everyone's expectations especially with a caliber of a series such as Little Busters but from an objective standpoint, that's not an excuse. J.C. Staff has a history of adaptations \u2013 some which transformed into a revolution while others dropped the ball. From the viewpoint of an anime-only viewer, I will say that J.C. Staff pulled off an alright adaptation. However, based on some technical backgrounds, the series just pulls way too many comedy with not enough what the fans actually may want. It's a bit of a disappointment but I guess we always can't get everything we want. To me though, this looked like a buildup to a greater medium. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of Little Busters comes together like a picture frame on a wall. It fits right but probably not all the way through especially in some of the earlier episodes. It does have its appealing imagery though especially with expressions on some of the characters' faces during various reaction scenes. For more of the fun factors, there is the moe incidences of some of the younger characters. The series adapts these scenes to seemingly give a lighthearted outlook because the series has a more pleasant feeling of fun and high school comedy. At other incidences though, there are serious scenes and even emotions especially in one of the later arcs. The background artwork seems only mediocre though and nothing seems to stand out. Along with the school uniforms, the series keeps itself with its generic designs.\\n\\n\r\nAs for music/soundtrack, the series maintains its composure of that lighthearted melody. Jun Maeda orchestrates the rhythms for the series whom is already known for his other works such as Air, Clannad, and Kanon. In general, I found the overall tone of the soundtrack to be above mediocre but not too unique. Most of the OST is lighthearted with a soft paced tone. Although beautiful and melancholic at many variances, it seems to be a bit repetitive and ultimately becomes somewhat overbearing in various scenes. It's almost as if the music is on repeat. The OP song, Little Busters! by Rita depicts the team members from the series formed by friendship, connections, and unity. It also shows some expressions from various characters that can be seen as melancholic or out of this world. (especially for Riki's case) The ED song follows a similar suit.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Little Busters is a charming little gem but occasionally loses its shine. By the way it portrays itself, the series suffers flaws from pacing, direction, a seemingly weak adaptation coupled with some edgy artwork problems. The series also misdirects and fails to bring emotions from what fans expected from the characters themselves. It's not pleasing when you realize that something so emotional can zoom so fast right through. The series does make its way with good comedy though and its colorful cast of characters. Along with that, LB brings for a heartwarming feeling to viewers especially when you're looking for something lighthearted to watch. The characters themselves forms the team known as Little Busters (the title of the anime itself) and with that, they walk down a future of dreams and friendship; at least for now.",

            "content": "To all you Key and Little Busters! VN fans out there, at least have the courtesy to read this before you down vote it. If you're a sucker for tons of melodrama and cute girls, by all means watch this. If you're the latter, read on.\r\nAnyways, the moment I watched a character cry over her favorite park bench being destroyed, I finally gave up after struggling through 15 episodes of this anime. No matter how much I wanted to love this, I couldn't. And since this anime has 8 and 9 reviews as its top reviews, I'm going to shed some light on this animeso people won't waste their time with this.\\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, I have not played the VN. If this was seriously true to the VN, then that's great for all you VN fans who have been waiting for this. If I have a nostalgic feeling for something, I also can be subjective to favoritism and like things more than I should. However, in this review, I will be treating the anime and VN as different entities and therefore make this an anime only review.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I start off, this is my personal opinion and only my personal opinion, so I'm not trying to say that I've watched every great masterpiece out there and know what \"true\" masterpieces are. I honesty have a high enjoyment factor with most things, so low ratings are rare for me. \\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters! desperately tries to combine sports, slice of life, melodrama, comedy, and a whole array of concepts, and to be quite frank, it doesn't work at all. Our main character Riki is your \"I had a terrible past as a child\" type of deal but quickly made friends with a group known as the \"Little Busters\" that helped him through his tragic times. Riki is essentially as bland as you can get. He's weak, indecisive, but when girls are in trouble, he'll magically gains confidence and become a legendary savior. Yeah, one of those guys. Anyway, the group has some pretty interesting characters that weren't all that bad, however, things pretty much go downhill from there.\\n\\n\r\nFast forwarding to high school, The group all decide to recruit baseball players to form some baseball team that later on becomes almost non-important, but that's beside the point. So this \"baseball\" team basically gives our MC Riki an excuse to walk around campus and talk to random girls, because obviously a manly baseball team would suck. And you guessed it! He definitely picks up quite the amount of females. Your female cast that is slowly introduced is your typical bland, generic, \"I've seen this stuff too many times to care\" type of deal. We have the perfect cool beauty, the short little adorable girl who shouts \"wafu!\", your silent, unemotional bookworm, blahblabhalbh\\n\\n\r\nAnd sure enough, each of these females has some terrible awful past that totally seems out of place. Now we suddenly shift from recruiting baseball members into a full blown melodramatic case involving unbelievable sob stories complete with cheesy Key production supernatural twists. Riki, being our main character, is obviously devoted to helping all these females out with the best of his abilities, and of course, he always manages to fix everything. And in the end, they all go back to playing baseball and happy story all over again.\\n\\n\r\nOh right, and there's also some major important \"secret of the world\" plot while all of this goes on, but after 15 episodes, all we know is these secrets are notes tied to cats. Yeah. cats. And the slips say your generic ambiguous \"what the hell does this even mean\" quotes that in the end, you honestly don't care about this secret of the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is at best, mediocre. Gags get repetitive and used over and over. Most of the comedy is focused on the muscles freak Masato, who is always losing in fights due to his stupidity and getting himself in silly situations. Our little adorable character Kud offers some Engrish and adorableness that isn't exactly innovative, but still provided a few bright spots here and there. Riki gets himself involved in all sorts of situations with the ladies, and Rin becomes catlike and scared of people who try to befriend her. Besides the fact, these happy carefree episodes in between the serious dramatic episodes feel really awkward and out of place. I admit that one cooking episode was fun to watch, and was  probably my favorite episode out of the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nSo what did we get in the end? Generic characters, generic and cheesy melodrama, decent and overused comedy, and some random ass baseball theme behind all of it. What am I suppose to like? The dramatic scene of a student council president breaking a school bench? The slice of life elements, even though they don't associate with anything SLIGHTLY related to school besides their baseball team?\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to like this so much, which is why I watched up until half of episode 16. But I really can't take this anymore. The execution is terrible and I'm just going to play the VN and not waste my time. Thanks for reading, and please comment on my profile so I can improve my future reviews.",

            "content": "You probably have heard a lot of things about Little Busters, ranging from \"This is an adaptation from masterpiece VN!\", \"J.C staff actually did a good job\", \"It's totally inferior to the VN\" to \"This is an absolute trash!\".\r\nNow, If you're confused about this polar reactions, then I think I should say that... Yes, Little Busters! is a very different anime every time you change your own mindset about it. That's why I think we need a technical review a bit early so you can probably guess the overall quality of Little Busters!, or probably just to see another point of view about it.\r\nSo, beforewe get to the real question, \"Is Little Busters! a good anime?\", let me clarify things about my own position :\\n\r\n- I have played some routes of Little Busters! VN, but nothing beyond what anime viewers currently watch...except of Rin 1 (Rin's \"fake\" route), which only told one spoiler material (which is not really hard to be guessed for now anyway)\\n\r\n- As a result of that situation, I can only judge Little Busters! from the anime-only viewers view point. However, having seen Rin 1 made me realize something about the future of Little Busters! story:\\n\\n\r\n\"This sh*t hides a lot of things behind it's carefree atmosphere.\"\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nThis review is composed by \"THE GOOD THINGS\" and \"THE BAD THINGS\" about Little Busters! TV animation. I will try to keep myself objective as an anime viewer only, but with some awareness about the general direction of the future story.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nWe could say that Little Busters! is composed by three main components :\\n\r\n- Common route materials : Slice of life materials with carefree and silly atmosphere. Serves as introduction and development episodes for the characters. Also, some of them are introduction for \"Secret of the world\", the main plot behind all of Little Busters! story. And baseball.\\n\r\n- Heroine route materials : At the first glance, it's generic KEY melodrama. Most of the story materials are related to each heroine's past, and of course they are going to end with \"Everything is fine\" happy ending.\\n\r\nRight, right?\\n\r\n...\\n\r\n- And then that's when Refrain, the main route of Little Busters will hit the fans. It reveals the \"Secret of the world\" which is always hinted at the entire part of Little Busters.\\n\\n\r\nTHE GOOD :\\n\r\nRefrain is claimed by many as Jun Maeda's peak of career as a writer, and generally it's a consensus that without Refrain, Little Busters! is nothing sort of special.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I know. Refrain is not here yet. There's also a possibility that Refrain won't deliver as well as people claim to be, especially since it's under JC Staff's helm now. BUT knowing that there's something huge called Refrain and the so called \"Secret of The World\" probably could change your view point about the common route and heroine route episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty hard to talk about this without go into details, but one thing for sure \"There are a ton of clues that you can find in the series regarding 'Secret of The World'\". It also  connects a lot of seemingly random materials into one unity. Little Busters! scriptwriter also did a good job at incorporating them into very limited episodes, so kudos for that.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about character arcs, they are actually kinda decent. They are composed by a lot of themes, ranging from a simple symbolical story about memories to a complex story that involving astronauts, rebellion, life-death situation and magic in one package! However, they aren't without their glaring flaws...\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD :\\n\r\nIndividually, Little Busters! current story is pretty weak, mostly caused by amateurish direction and grade EX adaptation difficulty of original material. Little Busters! original material also had an obvious weakness : Although LB is a clever concept, it has a lot of writers which resulting in a lot of quality inconsistency in each of heroine routes.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other flaws : LB humor generally is very... silly and may turn some people off (although it's pretty funny and lovely if you gave it a chance to grow in you). LB also has a pretty disappointing route as the first route, since it's kinda sacrificed so people can see a sort of drama without waiting for 10++ episodes before some real drama starts. Some people are also complaining about the lack of \"feels\" in Little Busters!. It's a valid complain, although I have to say that some of them are coming from unrealistic expectation that they will cry at the first arcs of Little Busters. Folks, they were never meant as the primary power of Little Busters!, just like every other KEY works. Also, I have seen plenty of teary confessions from some watchers, so I think it's not anywhere as bad as people suggest.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION : 7. Individually it's only decent at best, but it has a lot of potential to be great later.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nTHE BAD :\\n\r\nJ.C Staff weren't remembered for great art quality, and Little Busters! isn't even a good example of J.C Staff animation works.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of \"QUALITY\" shots, strange usage of effects, strange expressions, etc... Just to name a lot of homework that needs to be improved for the next season. To worsen things, KEY usually was related to Kyoto Animation, which caused a high expectation of KEY works in terms of art quality.\\n\\n\r\nTHE GOOD :\\n\r\nHowever, they also did a good job at times, especially at some nature shots (although it's nowhere close to KyoAni quality). I think most people also have no problem with the character design, which is kinda similar to Na-Ga design(The man behind Angel Beats and half of Little Busters character design. One thing for sure, it will turn less people off compared to traditional KEY character design. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion : 6. Decent at times, but generally are quite bad. At least it has a pretty good character design.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nMUSIC\\n\r\nTHE GOOD : KEY are widely known as a company that incorporate amazing music to support it's emotional punches, and Little Busters is not an exception to that.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters! opening also known as one of the best KEY vocal OST, and it's remixed (again) for the TV series! Alicemagic, the ED song, is also a great song, probably even better than the pre-remixed version. Generally, they are not only serves as a good song musically, but they also give a lot of hints about the overall story of Little Busters!\\n\\n\r\nVoice works are decent. However, they will be tested at Refrain, when they were expected to show a wider scale of emotions. I think we have to wait until then to fully score their performance.\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD : The music director simply needs to be fired. Also, some people may be turned off by some character voices (ex : Komari).\\n\\n\r\nConclusion : 7. Good songs, bad direction.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nTHE GOOD : This is one of the part when Little Busters! shines.\\n\\n\r\nMany people claim Little Busters! as a group of \"uninteresting and stereotype characters\". In contrary to that, I can safely say that it's a premature judgement and they should peek a bit deeper into their characteristics.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters! original cast are unusual, for the starter : 4 boys and one girl, that's something that people expect from some girl-oriented visual novel. At the first glance, they are composed by various roles, including the \"leader\", \"normal person\", \"the idiot\", \"the cool boy\", and a... \"cat obsessed girl?\". It doesn't seem special at first, but tell me any work which is composed by similar composition (Especially for a show that dig more into male demography). I know that even finding an example would be hard.\\n\\n\r\nAt the deeper analysis, it's getting more unique. The main character, Riki, is pretty much an ordinary boy at the first glance, but there's something really unique in his \"normal\" behaviors. Simply said, he didn't act as a main character of an anime, and I find it's really refreshing. And he even hid a lot of mysteries behind his usual daily life, something which probably he didn't realize for now.\\n\\n\r\nThe main heroine, Rin, is also an odd example. \"Cat loving girl\" alone wouldn't be unique, but I find her anti-social behaviors are anything but normal for a main heroine of a romance series (not to add that it's really different from usual anti-social characters, which is usually portrayed as a loner/very silent). But that alone won't make her special. Her subtle, slow but sure developments are what made her a lovable character, since she actually grows rapidly along the story progression, even though she haven't even got her own route yet!\\n\\n\r\nWe probably haven't learned much about the rest of the boys. Kyousuke for sure is charismatic, but for now we can only tell that he hides a lot of secret behind him. We barely know anything about kengo for now, and Masato is a... lovely muscle idiot. But, don't worry. They will have their own spotlight later, and it's also a grand one.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the rest of the (girl) casts? They are really varied, and most of them are having good qualities behind their seemingly-generic attitude. Kud, for example, bashed a lot for being a \"lovable Wafu~ mascot\", but behind that she also hides a lot of characteristics. For example, She's actually really smart. One of her favorite theory is many-world interpretation theory, and she actually can solve some conceptual physic problems on her own. To compensate, she also had a lot of problems on trivial things, and she actually has a severe case of confidence problem. Now, what part of her is generic, again?\\n\\n\r\nAnd all of those qualities aren't even the main power of Little Busters! characters. Their main power are their own chemistry. This is the part when they really shine, when they slowly growing together as a group of a really tight-knotted good friends, and it will only getting better as the series evolving.\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD :\\n\r\nToo bad, to see their real potential, you have to invest for a lot of episodes before they grown in your heart. You will also have a polar impressions about some of the heroines, although most likely you will like all of the original members of Little Busters!... which is barely even scratched for now.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion : 8. IMHO it's the main power of Little Busters! If you don't like them, probably it's your own loss.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nTHE GOOD :\\n\r\nNow, this is a serious question... \"Is watching Little Busters an enjoyable experience\"?\\n\\n\r\nI personally will answer with \"yes\". It requires some patience to wait for the group to grow, but most of the time it worth the wait. The best part of the story haven't even come yet for now, but it's already progressing pretty fast since they already thrown a lot of more noticeable clues regarding \"the secret of the world\". Some of the routes also have potentials to bring plenty of FEEL, although they aren't really exceptional for now.\\n\\n\r\nLike what I have said before, the 2/3 early part of Little Busters! are only serving as an introduction for the real story. I don't want to sound like a broken machine, but there are different nature of stories. This is the series where you can't judge the arcs individually. They are meant to be rated as a whole series.\\n\\n\r\nIt may be not as great as what you expect initially, but one thing for sure : It's a common consensus that Refrain is definitely better than the rest of the routes, since it tying the entire story into one unity of a story called \"Little Busters!\".\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD :\\n\r\nIt requiring patience from you, so it won't be enjoyable for those who don't even want to wait for that. Of course, there's no guarantee that you WILL enjoy it even if you are following them with patience, so I think you could just drop the series if the first +- 14 episodes aren't fitting to your taste.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion : 7. It most likely will worth the wait, although there's also a good probability that it just doesn't fit to your taste from the very beginning.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nGENERAL CONCLUSION : 7.\\n\\n\r\nJ.C staff's adaptation turns out to be better than what everyone expect at the beginning. Sure, many will disagree with me, but there are a lot of people that enjoy Little Busters as it is right now. There is a myth that only blind VN players who are supporting this adaptation right now, but it turns out that many of LB fans are... newcomers. So, the only way to found out about your opinion toward this adaptation is by trying it by yourself.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it's a very hit or miss story. The story as for now probably isn't a masterpiece by any means, but it has a potential to be. Nobody know for sure if the rumored \"Refrain\" will be a success or not, but in my opinion they have laid a pretty solid stage as the foundation.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you're still unsure about this, just wait until Season 2 comes out. You won't miss the news if they manage to deliver Refrain brilliantly, and if it's the contrary, you can safely ignore the entire series.",

            "content": "Little busters! Another great anime created by Key, so far after watching the first three episodes it has certainly lived up to my expectations.\r\nIf you have played the VN(visual novel) of little busters, you will surely not be disappointed in the anime, the anime does a brilliant job on adapting from the VN, the characters and music are identical to the VN.\r\nThe story so far is really similar to the VN which is fantastic to know that the anime will be like the VN, so for those that are wondering what the story is about\r\n--------------SPOILER ALERT!!!---------------\r\nIt is about a boy named Riki that suffers froma disease that caused him to have sleep attacks occasionally. When Riki was a child his parents died which left him homeless and depressed but a group of kids called little busters reached out to him and let him join the group of friends. Since then he has been inseparable to that group. \\n\r\n--------------SPOILER END---------------------\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has done a great job in capturing the character just like they are in VN and even though you haven't played the VN, you will love the characters easily.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the anime is exactly like the music in the VN which is always a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the characters looks better in the anime than in the VN the characters such as komari seems a lot more cuter in the anime which is a plus :D\\n\\n\r\nOverall Little busters! is a great adaptation of the VN so far and hopefully it shall continue to be like the VN. Anyone that loved the VN will certainly love the anime so far and even though you haven't played the VN it will provide a really good first impression as it is a great slice of life anime which really nice story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nP.S - sorry for the large usage of the word VN XD",

            "content": "J.C. Staff, I was wrong about you! I was actually one of the many who was extremely disappointed about Kyoto Animation not picking up the job. Since Kyo-ani did a good job with Clannad Air Angel Beats and Kanon, you know they Key (Maeda) line up. But from what I have seen so far, J.C. delivered.\r\nLittle Busters! is a Key Visual Novel scripted by the Jun Maeda we all know love and hate. And it isn't like most of the visual novel adaptations. It simply can't be, it's too well known, the references are very firmly imprinted in the readers' minds. And in this, Ibelieve J.C. has done well.\\n\\n\r\nMusic, Little Busters! is a very good song and I am very happy, I AM VERY HAPPY they kept a remix version of that song as the opening, same for Alicemagic for the ED, it's staying true and appealing to the veteran readers. I can watch the anime hear the song and remember the VN. It's a very cool feeling. The same can be said for the BGM in the anime, those are OST tracks directly from the VN and can allow a veteran reader to refer to the awesome moments in the VN that the scene is corresponding to.\\n\\n\r\nPlot, so far it is accurate, to some degree, There were some cool \\n\r\ngags skipped or shortened but that as anime time allotted goes, is to be expected.\\n\\n\r\nIt'll be interesting to see how the rest of the plot is written in seeing how Little Busters! plot looks like a storyboarding nightmare and you literarily require several play through to beat it, with plot information added during each different play through.\\n\\n\r\nWe'll see, but for now I love the show. It appeals a lot to us veteran readers. so far I don't think I would mind J.C. Staff doing Rewrite. we'll see",

            "content": "Last Edited : 4 Feb, 2013\r\n--NOTE--\r\nFirst of all, Little Busters! is still Airing. So this review is based on how many episodes i've been watching. So for people who hate someone who reviews the anime when it stills Airing. Please, we just want to 'guide' some people who hasn't watch the anime yet. So that they can tell whether it is a perfect anime for them or not based on episodes that have been aired. And note that i will edit and update this review till the anime finished airing. Though, for now i will be tallk more on comparison between the anime andthe VN.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters! or LB for short is an anime that adapted from VN. If u know Clannad, Air, or Kanon (Key Trio) this is another great VN from Key. It tells a story about Naoe Riki whose father and mother were dead when he stills a kid. Spend his remaining day in sorrow and sadness, comes 4 kid that pretended to be called \"Little Busters\". Sadness that always been tailing Naoe now has gone because they comes to his life. And so they still spend time together in High school...\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's for the synopsis. The story itself is great (in VN). As expected from Key. As for anime, good news that J.C.staff really adapted the story carefully. Although, the time frame looks different from the VN. And a lot of scene from the original story (VN) is edited or deleted here and there (Clannad too, but managed to be as great as the vn). Lets hope that J.C.Staff had a good reason for this. As for me, i really enjoyed the pace of the story. It likes when i'm watching Clannad. Slow and Entertaining. Lots of Comedy here. But anyway some part funnier in the VN though. An example is the old man Kojirou's screaming. Back in the VN i was laughing for 5 minutes or so when Riki comes to his rooms and he Scream like hell, too funny. In anime? a little boring.. But now i get it, Little Busters is a tale of friendship and adolescence. So, maybe they focus more on LB Team Friendship than a comedy, though the comedy now gettin' better. And of course for the drama too.\\n\\n\r\nArt.... i must say that the art... is average. Yeah right it is colorful and the background is beautiful. And the character face.. looks similiar from the original VN. Great. Too bad it looks pale. But now J.C.Staff seemed put more effort on this anime. The animation got better and better. Good news for fans. And keep this up J.C.Staff!\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, the animation style looks similiar to KyoAni's. So for people who love Clannad and K-on! Art, you will love it too. Plus, if you are a moe seeker, enjoy the ultimate moe in Little Busters. Although, some people hate the extensive moe in Little Busters.\\n\\n\r\nKomari \"Fuueee..\"\\n\r\nNggghhhhh!\\n\\n\r\nKud \"wafuuuu~\"\\n\r\nNGGGGHHHH!!!\\n\\n\r\nBut.... there are random panty shoots in Little Busters. Too bad, if it can be like Clannad (no panty shoots) it will be perfect, i think...\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening \"Little Busters\" is great. Just great! I believe people sing along the opening when they watch Little Busters. Best Opening so far in my opinion for Key's anime. And to be honest, i played the VN because i saw the intro in youtube and love the song LOL. And for the ending, again its the best Ending for Keys VN (and Anime). Although the BGM is not that great.. the best BGM will be Clannad i think, Little busters BGM, is good, just average. Good news that J.C.staff used an unused track in the VN. And its good.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now character. You know Characters from Keys always seem interesting.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the main male, Naoe Riki. I love his character, really. Clumsy but can be cool sometimes. Always picked up by Kurugaya. Has a baby face. So long, he's alright. Just, in Komari's Arc when Komari fell to depression, how can he be that calm? It seems that he has this in his mind, \"Ah next episode Komari's Arc ended so everything will be alright.\" \\n\r\nFeel unnatural there. But, later on, he matured a little by little. As he and the teams always work together to solve the teams or individual problems.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now Rin, she is the main male (right?). To be Honest, among all the girls, she is my favorite. Dont know why but her shyness is just cute. And i like her when she kicks Kuzu, ahh i mean Masato LOL. And i was \"NGGGHHH\" when she played with the cats. Moooeee.....\\n\r\nBut i feel like crying when she cried and hug Komari when her Arc ended, sweets.. And she get many char development till now (episode 17). Good thing that the development easy to notice so thats the viewers can feel the development and the character deeper.\\n\\n\r\nKyousuke, i just LOL'ed. All he did was almost out of place. Like creating a battle game that use a random weapon. And the way he test someone who want to join Little Busters team, LOL. Clannad funny because there are Sunohara, Little Busters funny because there are Kyousuke and Kuzu ahh i mean Masato.. Kinniku Yay Yay~ But sadly, in the first few episodes, he shines so much, bring the heavy content comedy to the viewers. But the comedy content that he (with Masato and Kengo) brings now decreased little by little.\\n\\n\r\nFor people who read the VN. Maybe you will notice that some characters seems different (personality). That because J.C.Staff edited some scene from the VN as we have talked before. But in exchange of edited scene, they added more friendship themes on this anime. Its now brings the viewers more about how LB team communicate with each other. It, for me is a great thing. As you know that, in VN, especially romance genre, when the story (of each arc) is near the end, its only about the main protagonist and the main heroine in the arc. It just the lovey dovey couple. But J.C.Staff didn't do that in the adaption. Because they want to show more the relationship of each member of LB!. They want to show more the Friendship among the members. Which is great.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters is a funny and (will be) heartwarming anime this season. I have high hopes for this anime. Although its too bad KyoAni break a contract with Key to animate Little Busters. But its alright if J.C.Staff can keep up the good work, as we know the quality of the anime has increased. And Little busters! reached 2nd place together with Chuunibyou (Yes, KyoAni's anime) in the \"Most Popular Fall 2012 anime\" polling with 1060 votes while the 1st place (Sword Art Online) is 1082 votes. So, J.C.Staff did their best to produce this anime so that it can rivaled the KyoAni's anime : Chuunibyou.\\n\\n\r\nSo for people who complaining :\\n\\n\r\n- Why it is J.C.Staff who produce Little Busters! not KyoAni ?\\n\r\n- The anime is slow-paced\\n\r\n- Why it has a lot of Moe here and there?\\n\r\n- I hate the voice of She/ He\\n\r\n- I hate the personalities of His/ Her\\n\\n\r\nWell, first. As we know from above, Little Busters! managed to get the 2nd place in the polling. Meaning that J.C.Staff is doing their best. And don't forget that J.C.Staff has a lot of great anime that they produce : Toradora, Sakurasou (still Airing), Shakugan no Shana, Ano Natsu de Matteru, Azumanga, Bakuman series and many more. So believe and enjoy their hard work.\\n\\n\r\nYou hate Moe? Can't say much, its your taste. But i believe, Animes that adapted from Key's VN (And Jun Maeda is the story creator) always had a extensive Moe-ness, slow paced, and the same comedy-style. Clannad, Air, Kanon is another example. So maybe Key requested that their VN adapted anime must be like that. You know the remake of Kanon by KyoAni? That happened because Key unsatisfied with the Kanon 2012 version (the predecessor of kanon 2006 by KyoAni). Maybe the 2012 version : didnt have Moe?, too fast-paced (13 episodes). Clannad, Air and Kanon is high rated despite that they have moe-tification, slow-paced. If Little Busters follow their Senpai, i think it will be success too and satisfy the viewers. Which is great right?\\n\\n\r\nAs for people who hates some of seiyuus or some personalities (maybe changed a little from the VN), as we know, although J.C.Staff changed a bit of scene in order for friendship themes cause but despite that, they put an effort to keep the originals being kept if possible. So they have to keep the original seiyuus from the VN although some of them didnt satisfy you. However, some characters suffer a seiyuu changes, because of some reason. Example : Nishizono Mio.\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you understand those, hopes that you now can view Little Busters! differently = free of doubts. So that u can enjoy the show to their fullest. But of course i respect personal opinion and taste. After all i wrote this review so that you can decide whether this anime is for you or not. Not to urge you to watch it no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the closing, i enjoy this anime very much. Enjoyment = 9. For people who love Slice of life or Drama and love a heartwarming tale with comedy. And love the friendship themes but alright with the ultimate moe-ness and slow paced (KEY VN adapted anime styles) , Little busters is for you. Do watch it.",

            "content": "I review: Little Busters \r\n           AND\r\n Little Busters - Refrain\r\n(I am comboing them because I marathon'd them together.)\r\nIf you were looking for romance, it isn't here. It is more about friendship than anything. If you are a romance lover, it doesn't matter, because the story being told is so damn good.\r\nAlrght so, I started Little Busters when it was coming out weekly. It had a slow start, and I didn't find it that entertaining for me for some reason. The first girl's story was kinda lackluster. I then stopped watching Little Busters at around episode9, because I thought it was bullshit. After both seasons became finished, I decided to give it another shot (because I ran out of anime).\\n\\n\r\nThe humor of the show isn't as funny until the characters grow on you, then it becomes frikin' hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, some of the girls were really annoying, but as they grew on me, I started loving them. They aren't the cookie cutter pasted girls that I thought they once were. \\n\\n\r\nAs usual, each girl has a hidden problem, and boy were some of their stories REALLY out there. \\n\\n\r\nI come across the supernatural. There is this under-laying supernatural theme going on. \\n\r\nOne big, giant, supernatural theme. The show has this big mystery behind everything. All the girl's problems that have been solved, wasn't just forgotten like how some harems do. It ties in perfectly. This big mysterious supernatural theme is what kept me going and watching, and getting excited every time I was given a new clue. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character, as I thought, was just one of those super nice to everyone, goody-two-shoes boy. Well, he still is, but the fact that he is that for a reason makes it all the better. Everything that this show has given us, they give us a reason. They explain it, and you will believe it. \\n\\n\r\nNever before have I seen a harem show that ACTUALLY focuses on other MALE characters. The male characters have a deeper story than any of the girls, because it ties in with EVERYTHING.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is good. When they want you to feel, they will make you feel. I don't quite remember it as much as I do with Clannad or Toradora's sad music, but it still gets the job done.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good enough. I don't remember any spectacular things about it, but they do show a good amount of movement, walking, and running. \\n\\n\r\nNOW FOR LITTLE BUSTERS - REFRAIN\\n\\n\r\nBrace yourself. Everything you just watched in the first show was only just build up. Refrain will take EVERYTHING you have just watched, and do something amazing with it. I could say the same thing that went for Clannad; The first show was just build up for Afterstory.\\n\\n\r\nJust sit back, and enjoy the long journey you earned: By watching Refrain.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL, I give Little Busters an 8, and Little Busters Refrain a 9. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is best for marathoning (which I did) and was glad that I didn't have to wait weekly. Then I wouldn't have had the chain effect.",

            "content": "Coming from a person that has no idea what, \"Little Busters!\" is, I felt the need to write a review since the majority of people watching this are also new to the series. When I first heard of the show it seemed like some glorified anime that should be put on a pedestal. Unfortunately, it is not.\r\nTo start off, the story seems awkward. A group of students decide to create a baseball team because it's their leader's last year before graduating? Original yes, but it seems bland and pointless. However, I have heard and read some discussion that the plot thickens and gets extremely emotionbut until then, it gets a 4. \\n\\n\r\nNext, the art. I want to say that it's amazing and really nice to look at but I can't. It looks the same as anime from a few years back so it's nothing unique or amazing when compared to some other anime. However, budget must be taken into account when it comes to this so I'll be flexible here. Art gets a 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound plays a crucial part in anime and for \"Little Busters!\" the sound is good. It's not horribly bad but at the same time, not amazingly good. It's neutral. The OP is catchy and the ED is pretty generic in my book but it's a good formula so I can see why they stuck with it. Overall, sound gets a 7.\\n\\n\r\nNow comes character. In most animes characters play an important part. In Little Busters, it feels as if the characters are blobs and nothing more. There's a generic muscle head, samurai, impulsive leader, shy girl, moeblob, etc. We've all seen them before. The main character, Naoe, who's voice I cannot stand is pretty much a sissy that's diagnosed with Narcolepsy. We find out that his parents died and he becomes isolated which is a nice back story since he's the only character that actually gets one. In the end, characters could be better but for now, it gets a 6.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, it all boils down to enjoyment and whether one actually has fun when watching the anime. I will give this a good score because even if there's no real story, or amazing art, or enchanting sounds, or great character development. As long as I enjoy the anime, I'll continue watching, and \"Little Busters\" does just that. It's fun to watch since they have a good sense of comedy and the characters are all likable. So this gets a 8 here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, \"Little Busters\" seems to foreshadow a deeper plot that we have not seen yet as they are mostly just introducing the characters to us right now so until we get further into the show, it gets a 5/10 for now.",

            "content": "Little Busters!\r\nIf you're like me and you're thinking about watching this because the visual novel was made by Key, don't. Watch it with an independent mindset, free of Clannad, Kanon, etc. If you don't you're just gonna find disappointment.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story was definitely not as good as Key's previous works. Yes, it followed the general plot of a high school boy helping multiple girls cope and effectively saving their lives in one way or the other, but it simply was not as engaging. There were many story elements that  could have been left out. For example, Riki's narcolepsy. So what? It did not influencethe progression of the story whatsoever. There was also no romantic interest, but the friendships gained throughout the series filled in the hole nicely for those who don't mind the absence of romance. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs expected, it was beautifully animated. No complaints. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music lacked variety. There was probably one tune that played in every emotional scene throughout the show. Variety is always good when the anime is only about friendship and nothing else is going on. Otherwise the show becomes drab very quickly. Also, the female voices were THE MOST annoying I have ever heard. I was relieved when Kurugaya would speak as she was the only normal sounding female voice in the series. This anime is not for people who detest whimpering, crybaby voice work that sounds like Asian porn.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were good with each having his/her own unique personalities. Each fought their own battles, emerging as victorious, developed characters. They were funny when they were supposed to be, and emotional when it was expected. However, I could not get around how they acted like 5 year olds throughout the whole show. If the producers were aiming for a moe approach, they definitely failed. I saw nothing cute in these characters at all. Maybe it's because i'm not into that stuff. But panty shots of bears and ducks on teenage girls aren't really my thing. I found it awkward and completely unnecessary to the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was definitely not as enjoyable as I thought it would be. Towards the middle of the season, I was struggling to keep watching. I have a policy to watch an anime all the way through once I reach a certain point, so there was no going back. The story was boring and the characters were annoying. As usual, Key was aiming for an emotional tale that would grip our hearts and make us feel the pain the characters felt but this simply was not the case this time. It was just, meh. I would recommend this like I would recommend SAO: I wouldn't. Unless you like mediocre anime that relies solely on fan service to get viewers. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you just finished Clannad and want to watch another one of Key's visual novels animated, do yourself a favor and skip this one and watch Angel Beats or something instead. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a second season titled \"Little Busters: Refrain\" and i'm going to be watching it when it airs toward the end of 2013.  Who knows? Maybe it will pull an \"Afterstory\" on us and crush our hearts to bits before an amazing ending. Hopefully it isn't as painful to watch as Season 1 was. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "There is one thing I can say about this show \"Under-Rated\"!\r\nThis show has been treated as quite \"generic\" and too \"slice-of-life\". I say to those people \"You obviously haven't watched the damn thing\"! This anime is exactly what you'd expect from a Key anime, very emotional. A lot of the scenario's in this show are pretty unique and are something you really DON'T expect. \r\nStory: 8\r\nSo it's about a group of friends that decide to form a baseball team as a way to enjoy their last year together, seeing as Kyousuke, the one who essentially holds the group together, will be graduation soon. This issort of just an excuse to bring together all the characters, like the Drama Club in Clannad. The main MEAT of this story is \"the secret of the world\". Now, I'm going to look at this from an anime viewer's point of view (I have indeed played the VN), this plot point is quite interesting. Riki and childhood friend Rin receive a letter telling them that they must complete a number of tasks to discover the secret of the world. As the anime goes on, this plot point becomes much more interesting with plenty of hinting and foreshadowing, especially in the most recent episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nAlthough I like the art in this anime, I have to say that it loses points due to poor animation in some of the earlier episodes. Some of it is WAY too noticable and just leaves a bit of a poor taste in my mouth. But the episodes that do have good animation, are REALLY good. Episode 14 for example looks absolutely fantastic and if every episode was like that then I'd easily give the art a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Little Busters is great. It perfectly fits the show and the emotion in it. It's also just well composed overall. The only problem I have is some of the placement with the songs with some times. The sound director seems to like playing a track for like 5 seconds and then changing it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are great and lovable. Every character isn't 2-dimensional. They have all have a personality that stands out, they have very interesting ways of talking (such as certain characters having a certain phrase or word that they commonly use such as \"Wafu!\" with the character Kud and \"Kiniku! (Muscles)\" with Masato) and along with that, they all develop in interesting ways and have some pretty tear-jerking backstories.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoy this show, and if it goes the same way as the VN does, it will DEFINITELY become my favourite anime. The comedy is fairly funny (although gets a little repetitive at times), the drama is well done for the most part and it's really just a huge variety of emotions which makes it really interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nOverall, it's a good anime, worth a watch and with the way they're going currently and me knowing where the story goes later, this anime looks to be very promising and could probably get into the top 15 animes by the end of it's second season.\\n",

As of episode 8 , little busters is just a silly slice of life comedy series, and a mediocre one at that. \r\ncharacters\r\nwell this where the animeitself is completely annoying. all of the chacarters are just plain boring, but what i hate the most are the voice actressess for komari (and some other girls), i can\u00bft stand it, and i have read some people actually dropped the anime because of that, well now i see why. people say there are worse but fortunately i havne't run into them.\\n\r\nmusic is fine, and i like the OP and Ed songs.\\n\r\nin the end, maybe i'm just biased because i hate a lot of thing the anime presents: slow pacing, overused jokes, annoying voice actressess and female characters mostly, a lot of moe (not for me),\\n\r\n thanks for reading\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "At first I thought this show was about baseball and let it slip by fast. Then I found out it was not and decided to give it a try. I regret it.\r\nAfter having watched the first 6 episodes the anime was seriously below my expectations. Alas I read on the forums here that it gets better after about the 7th episode or so. So I pressed on. A waste of time, I tell you, I should've just dropped it right there and moved on to something that I could actually enjoy.\r\nThe anime suffers from bad story setup and lots of filler moments. What I meanby the latter is moments that really had no reason to be in the anime except to prolong it. Little Busters could be told in 12 episodes in a way that it would be actually interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIn it's current state, however, it was boring. It was so boring that I sometimes just left it playing in the background in small screen with \"always on top turned\" on and turned my attention elsewhere or even played music to make the experience at least a little bit bearable. I wanted to watch it all to give an accurate review.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the story, sure, there were some good moments or ideas but I've watched even worse anime that had those. Most of it was the usual stuff you could see coming from a mile away and when things actually got interesting for a moment, it was all ruined with a bad conclusion which either was very simple (but somehow still needed Riki's help) or it was solved with magic (as in - that's the way thing are, don't ask questions). Especially horrid was the 23rd episode. Just goes to show that no it doesn't get better after the 7th episode, it's just as bad till the end. However, it does make you think that it'll get better.\\n\\n\r\nSoundwise, the BGM was forgettable, the OP and ED poor, or not my style, whichever you prefer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were interesting (generally) for a brief moment when it was their time to shine (their arc) but after that they became generic and dull characters yet again. The two huge guy friends were at times especially painful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art being good is the only thing that saves this anime from an even worse score. That and cute voice acting. This anime might have the cutest \"moe noises\" ever. The most interesting part was actually the ending but with the disappointment that is Little Busters, I doubt I'm going to want to watch the second season.\\n\r\nWafuu~ and skip this anime.",

            "content": "First things first, Little Busters has the theme and genre of (in ascending order of importance): Comedy, Romance, slice of life, drama and friendship. Also, I will give a special mention to tearjerkiness. Of course, this means that this anime will be for those who enjoy these themes. Those who do not may not like it.\r\nNow, personally I believe a review should be written once the show has finished but I felt the need to write one down without the rankings being biased towards the visual novel and one which is written by someone who enjoys the above mentioned themes of this anime. Though takein account that my ranking system may be much more lenient than others so I will give a range of points which may seem appropriate. (of course, towards the people who find interest in this genre)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis will be a review based on what is going on so far. However I will also write about certain advancements of themes in general in the hopes to allow people to understand that what is shown now is not going to stay the same for the remaining of the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8 (+1, -2)\\n\r\nSo far, it follows an average slice of life theme where the main characters do what a high school students do best, mess around and have fun. However, there are hints of something strange throughout the revealed episode and also some drama developments. Both the gags and drama however, are dependent to a person. Some of it will appeal to you while some will not. Gags and drama will always be hit or miss. Personally, I felt these were well done since they managed to pull a out of laughs and jerked a few tears out of me.\\n\\n\r\nFuture insight- This slice of life theme is a way to get viewers to get to know the characters. The feeling of strangeness will develop into something big. There will be a wide variety of drama so if the first one does not appeal to you, then the next may.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7 (+2,-2)\\n\r\nOne thing which can be easily seen so far is that the animators have split their budget to make the art vary a lot. The casual slice of life and comedy scenes will not seem too well done but on the other hand, the drama scenes had beautiful art which allows the characters emotions to be felt. The art style is close to those of angel beats but quality does differ.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8(+2, -1)\\n\r\nThe music is reused from the original Little Busters visual novel. The opening and ending songs have both been slightly changed to make it more upbeat which makes it more catchy and interesting. These songs are really good and have meaningful lyrics. The OST in the anime is also very good however, at times it is not used appropriately at the beginning of the show. This issue has improved since then. The soundtrack is also fitting to the mood in the anime. Happy and cheerful scenes is lightened more with bright music while the sad scenes have there tension and heavy feel increased by melancholic music. \\n\\n\r\nFuture insight- Some of the most beautiful songs and soundtracks have yet to appear. These are really something to look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:8(+1,-3)\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are undeniably common archetypes. We have an air head, moe character, a cool big sister type, a shy girl and a trouble maker as the female roles. These archetypes are also exaggerated a lot which effectively allows each character to stand unique from each other. This exaggeration also makes their interactions give a warm and fuzzy vibe. For the male roles, we have a muscle sidekick, a weak protagonist, a cool leader, and a kendo user. The interactions of the male creates a large sense of friendship when they help each other and when they screw around. However sometimes the interactions are taken a bit too far which lessens the impact.\\n\\n\r\nFuture insight- It will depend on a person whether they enjoy these characters or not. Some people may not like these cliche characters but what makes these characters unique from ones in other cliche animes is that most of the characters background is explored in their own drama scenes later. A quiet girl has yet to make her appearance.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8 (varies too much)\\n\r\nI can only speak for myself here since everyone will find this different. I found the gags and slice of life scenes heart warming and uplifting. They bring a good smile to my face. The drama impacted quite a bit to me which allowed me to empathise with characters so far.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8 (+1,-2)\\n\r\nLittle Busters, although has a lot of room for improvement, is decently shown right now and has great potential for some very deep drama once you can connect with the characters. The theme of friendship has been portrayed very well when the music, characters and story comes together.  There was not a moment so far where I would feel bored.",

Little Busters! is originally a Visual Novel Developed by Key, The company that makes awesomely amazing series that would probably make the manliest man on earth cry, and I was never disappointing in any of their work . And here I can easily say that Little Busters! is my favorite Key series ( and I played/watched all of Key's Titles!! O.O )\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nSo the main story revolves around this kid named \"Naoe Riki\" who is in high school.. enjoying the school life and just hanging with his childhood friends (Rin, Masato and kengo)... you know high school stuff. But all this changes when his friend Kyouske comes back from Tokyo and suddenly decides to create a baseball team by the name of \"Little busters!\" (weeh shcokerz!). So from there on they give Riki the mission of finding other members to join the team, and that is how our main character meets the other 5 girls, they join the team and they all become this cutey big family. So the story progresses like most Key titles with Riki listening to the other girls problems and help them solve what ever is on their minds, sounds fair enough right? well here is where it gets tricky, aside of all that Riki and Rin keep reviving these mysterious messages stating that there is a secret of the world they live in, and they have to figure out what that secret is, Riki and Rin start receiving different tasks that moves them closer to the answer. Now I don't wanna spoil anything, but I can say that the secret of the world is reaaaaaaally jaw dropping and ... just shocking (in a good way), it changes the whole view of the series.\\n\\n\r\n Ok so was season 1 good and true to the visual novel? for me the answer is yes, because now that I finished season 1 I can tell where the developers were going when they made it. The main point of this season is to show us the characters in the best way possible, to let us explore the world of Little Busters! to let us see the characters such as Riki and Rin develop. They didn't rush the anime, they didn't go into the serious part, and they saved all that for season 2 (Refrain) which is a pretty good move because now we have seen all the characters, we know exactly who they are, we some them develop, now in Refrain we can relate more to them and understand them much better.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI have to be honest here, as much as I loved the anime .. I have to say that the art wasn't that amazing, It was a bit weird ... I am not sure what exactly was wrong with it, but i didn't like it as much as the Visual Novel's.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI think the character design is a major positive point in Little busters! because the characters were just amazing, at first you might see them a bit bland.. and a tad silly, but as you proceed in the series you will discover how awesome they are. Every character is unique and has his/her special design and his/her own awesome personality. All of them are lovable, I myself loved each and every character, and I think they are one of the most unique characters of any series i watched.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nWhen has Key ever made bad music. The music is just freaking hawt!! ahm excuse me I just loved the soundtrack... so anyway, you might not notice the background music that much in the anime because its an anime, and you don't really focus on the music in an anime as much as when you are reading a visual novel. But the anime did use the same OST and all of them were used perfectly and they all fit the moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was good. Great at times and just Ok at other times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo if I want to compare the anime with the original Visual Novel then I can just say that it was true to it. even though it skipped some small details here and there, but the anime was quite long, 26 episodes I think that's enough to explain the main story of the series and introduce the characters and the comedy was awwwesome :DD. All that aside the anime did have some changes that I quite loved and weren't in the VN. such as showing that some of the characters know what the secret of the world is, which builds up a really strong impact towards them. And I also loved the story Komari wrote about the The boy and girl helping the 8 dwarfs, I thought that was a really nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah.. All I can say is that I loved Little Busters! even if I didn't read the visual novel I am pretty sure I would have loved it as well. A lot of people are bashing the anime even fans of the visual novel... I think these people should just chill and enjoy the wonderful world of Little Busters! :3",

Its not lousy, ive seen plenty worse, but it could have beenmuch better.\\n\r\nSound: 10- The voice acting here i think is very well done, all the characters except for mio have the same VA from the visual novel, but mio's replacement did a fine job. Also the Opening is amazing, the ending is as well, the soundtrack themes are one of the best soundtracks ive ever heard as well.\\n\r\nCharacters: 10- All the main and supporting characters are unique in their own way, from the eccentric Haruka, the childish Komari, the mature Kurugaya, the mysterious mio, and all of the original members of the Little Busters are all likeable and unique characters.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10- While quite a few episodes were quite sad and emotional(In particular Haruka and Mio's arcs, as well as the last 3 episodes) their were plenty of bright and lighthearted moments as well, i couldn't have enjoyed it more.\\n\r\nOverall: 10- Little Busters is an anime that doesn't come around every day, it truly is special and in my honest opinion a real masterpiece\\n\r\n:)",

            "content": "To those who've never played the Visual novel:\r\nMy review would be different for 2 kinds of audience: The People who've played Little Busters Visual Novel and those who haven't. I will explain later as to why.\r\nI'll start off to those who've haven't seen the visual novel. At first glance you would believe it to be a usual happy-go-lucky comedy anime with very few character developments, but just like many of Key's works, Little Busters is in no way a happy-go-lucky anime. It is filled with drama that would put you at the edge of your seat at every turn. For those searching for comedy, thenthis anime is just for you. If your one to look for romance, then this anime is very romantic, except, not in a \"girl and boy like each other\" romance. Its romantic in a way that its dramatic romance. The characters are unique and balanced. Each character balances out the other, and makes the show even more interesting. The anime focuses on the relationship of the Little Busters, and does not go beyond friendship\\n\r\nTo be quick, if your one to find a new anime with comedy and romantic friendship and drama, this anime is perfect for you. I would recommend it. I admire the staff because they tried to change the some parts of the story and give some spice for original LB fans.\\n\\n\r\nTo those who've played the Visual novel:\\n\r\nI'll be frank. It was a big disappointment as an LB fan. I waited for a proper adaption since as usual, Visual Novels are vague to me, so I clear out the visual novel and then wait for an adaption. Well, to be frank, the Anime DID clear out the vague parts which are hard to understand with words only. The problem was that the staff did unnecessary and can be quite pissing changes. I won't point out the changes since these would show spoilers, basically, how I viewed the story and its value became VERY much less. Although important parts were well in place, they made changes on how these parts were shown. They forgot to add important details and disturbingly focused on friendship rather than the actual theme. They reduced romance to mere friendship drama and focused on comedy and friendships. They added unnecessary details and to be frank, in the visual novel, after each route I was at the edge of my seat about to cry(and yes, this happened even after repeating the story many times over), but the anime did not even bring me to the edge of my desk. \\n\\n\r\nWell, to conclude, the anime is certainly worth watching, but the visual novel is certainly better. As an LB! fan, the anime would definitely give you a new perspective of the story, so if your curious, GO WATCH!. There were changes here and there from the original story (which from me was very important and really pissed me off because of the changes), but the important parts were properly done. The art was very good, the voice actors did a wonderful job, the BGM was good, and character development was, as usual from Key works, wonderfully done\\n",

            "content": "The first thing I'd like to say about Little Busters! is to \"give it a chance\". If you can get past the first three episodes, you will be probably be able to ease into it- and the story will start to make a lot more sense.\r\nOne problem with Little Busters! seems to be that people expect another Clannad (possibly the most successful anime adaptation of a Key game thus far) animated by Kyoto Animation along with Air and Kanon 2006.\r\nWhat strikes me is that even before watching Little Busters!, many viewers who are familiar with other Key titles (animated by Kyoto Animation) already have acertain prejudice; that the show must somehow not be as great just because another company produced it. Or perhaps the opposite train of thought; Little Busters! should be great because Key created the game.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact is, however, that \"who created what\" aside, Little Busters! cannot be the same as its predecessors. It's a different game. \\n\r\nIn case you haven't noticed, it is not called \"Clannad II\" or \"Kanon the Sequel\". Yes, Maeda Jun's distinctive style is evident in the plot and characters, but walking into something with colored glasses on can really ruin the experience.\\n\\n\r\nSo throw the comparisons aside and prepare to enjoy Little Busters! as it is. The story can be a little difficult to understand at times, but I feel that J.C. Staff did a great job, particularly considering they had about three episodes to spare for each character's route. In addition, the game itself is structured in a way where each route is somewhat incomplete when it stands alone. The pieces really don't fall together until Refrain- which in turn won't really make sense until the first season is viewed. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Good luck with the first few episodes as you ease into it, forget about Clannad, enjoy Little Busters! as Little Busters!, and finish with Refrain; it's a good watch if you are okay with something with a slightly heavier storyline.",

            "content": "Little Busters! is the newest Key visual novel to be turned into a romantic/drama anime (along with Air, Kanon, Clannad) it is the second anime to be produced (after Angel Beats which was not a visual novel before becoming an anime) to be produced by J.C. Staff instead of Kyoto Animation. One thing to note about this show is that like its predecessors, it is about a main male character helping out other characters (usually female) and solving their problems. Along the way, a lot of drama, awesome music to complement said drama, and occasionally (well really only one so far in this anime) supernaturalevents occur.\\n\\n\r\nPlot \u2013 5\\n\r\nThe plot of Little Busters is nothing special. Before going any further though let me tell you that this is because the entire season is devoted to introducing the characters and sets up what is supposed to be the much better second season (Refrain) that was announced at the end of Episode 26. Unfortunately, this show still does not pull off its first season as well as Clannad did, so let\u2019s hope the second season is just as good and even better than the After Story. The plot consists of the main character, Naoe Riki, collecting members (mostly girls) to join the baseball team that he and his four other childhood friends started at their high school. This all began because Kyousuke, the leader of this group of friends and the oldest, wanted to do something fun together with everyone before he graduated at the end of the year and had to leave them. The one problem I find with this idea of gathering characters is that for some characters (especially Komari the first to join) I kind of forgot what their backstory was by the end since I watched this over several months as it was released. For some characters, like Kud and Haruka who have later arcs after they have already joined, this isn\u2019t as much of a problem. But if you\u2019re watching this simply for the baseball, you won\u2019t find much here. One last thing, unlike all of Key\u2019s other shows, so far at least, Little Busters has almost no romance whatsoever. It\u2019s never shown if anyone even has a crush on Riki or if Riki likes anyone as more than friend. The only romance at all is between Kengo and one other girl a little bit towards the end and between two minor characters, one of which has appearances in about 3 episodes and the other only gets one episode and nothing ever happens with that.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 9\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. The character designs are interesting and unique, and some of the scenes really have amazing visuals like starry night skies and sunsets. The visuals fit the sadder scenes nicely and change well according to what is going on.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 9 \\n\r\nObviously being a Key anime it\u2019s going to have a dramatic soundtrack (it better at least). This show doesn\u2019t quite stand up to Angel Beats or Clannad\u2019s soundtrack, but it does have some perfect songs for the mood (especially \u201cIn the town of continuing rain\u201d which I loved hearing every time it was played). It may take time to adjust to Komari\u2019s voice though as she has a \u201cfrail\u201d sounding voice (and Riki sound really young).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 8 \\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters (much like in Angel Beats) but Little Busters does a fairly good job of getting you to know each character. One thing that they did do right was make unique characters. Naoe Riki is a good main character who helps everyone solve their problems and has narcolepsy. I kind of wish they had used his narcolepsy a bit more during this season (I think he has three attacks in 26 episodes?), but I\u2019m guessing it comes more into the series in Refrain. Rin is Kyousuke\u2019s younger sister and the only girl in their group of friends prior to starting the Little Busters! team. She is a very shy girl who does not like talking to new people. Masato is a boy obsessed with his muscles and relies on being Riki\u2019s roommate in order to survive. Kengo is the only of the orginal five who does join the Little Busters right off the bat (sorry) because he is in kendo club. There are too many other characters to list them all separately but just know that all of the other girls who join later have some kind of tragic past (only Kurugaya does not get an arc in this, but I think I\u2019ve heard she has something more in Refrain?)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 7\\n\r\nI liked Little Busters! but I definitely don\u2019t think it was the best Key anime so far. I\u2019m really looking forward to Refrain, though, and I hope it will be as big of a success as the After Story was. I recommend waiting to watch this show until Refrain comes out since this anime lacks the romance that I was expecting it to have by now.",

I will be comparing this anime with another of Key's work, Clannad [Not After Story (Actually, the first few small arcs of After Story)] \r\nStory - 9\r\nThe story starts off by introducing multiple characters, and then going into character arcs in where the main character helps out the character that needs the help.  Very very similar to Clannad.  The character arcs were great!... except a fewof them had random supernatural moments, something I wasn't expecting from this anime, as the anime never really showed anything supernatural until the part it happens at.  Don't get me wrong, the arcs are still wonderful, enjoyable, addicting and emotional!  I did feel that the character arcs were a bit choppy, going from one arc to another without much of transition.  \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe art was wonderful, colors were pretty good, I enjoyed the style of everything.  Not much to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nDoing exactly what KyoAni did with Clannad, J.C pretty much used the soundtrack from the Visual Novel.  I still absolutely love the soundtrack, as they are great at setting the moods.  I also enjoyed the OP as well, a song that uplifts the spirit, something the entire anime is about!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 10\\n\r\nThe thing about this anime that stands out the most are their characters!\\n\r\nI absolutely love the design of the characters (especially the female ones, they just look awesome!).  Their personalities are the typical ones found in other animes, the optimistic ones, the shy ones, the cute ones, but we get to see what happens to their personality as they are presented with a conflict of some sort.

Effects of it include a male lead, a bunch of attractive females who have their own characters arcs as a means of developing them, a story that really sticks with the viewer and inane fantasy nonsense that shouldn\u2019t be there to begin with. Key Syndrome mainly works in the anime\u2019s favour however, with Clannad being the most potent example of how the formula works. Little Busters attempts to do the same with the same attitude and demeanour as Clannad, dare I say, it\u2019s practically the same thing. Does this make Little Busters bad? No,though it makes it very misguided as its own individual series to the point where it\u2019s nearly the same than watching another anime altogether.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, no: I haven\u2019t played the Visual Novel. It\u2019ll be evaluated as an anime only.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters stars token Key Syndrome male lead Riki, a boy who lost his parents and suffers from narcolepsy, which will put him to sleep whenever the plot wants to come to screeching halt. Compared to Tomoya from Clannad, he\u2019s seemingly fortunate to not have parents and actually have people supporting him from the very beginning \u2013 such a lovely change of pace. Riki is a second year student at a high school along with the rest of his social group, including the most popular male in the whole school (who, interestingly, likes to fuel the Yaoi truck with Riki) and a shy girl who spends her time with cats until she is inevitably developed into including more friends into her life and comfort zone.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things Little Busters seemingly did not contract from Key Syndrome is the plot \u2013 it\u2019s surprisingly weak and instantly forgettable, which isn\u2019t a good sign. Riki and his gang of misfits form a new school baseball team; because it\u2019ll be the last thing they do together. The popular aforementioned male \u2013 whose name is Ryousuke \u2013 will be graduating after the school year is over, since he\u2019s the oldest member of the group. The team is named Little Busters, due to it being their group name when they were kids. However, the plot transcends the baseball and becomes Clannad: Riki meets girls along the course of the story, they have tragic pasts and it\u2019s up to him to basically resolve their anguish through friendship. Another plotline is that Riki and the shy girl must do eight challenges in order to find out the secret of the world.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s too much going on and this is the main problem of the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nAt first the baseball plotline seems like the most prevalent one \u2013 it\u2019s usually the main focus and something baseball related happens nearly every episode, so of course it\u2019d make sense that it\u2019d be the main focus and yet Clannad bursts into the room, holding baseball against its will. Little Busters tries to follow its older brother rather too closely, in the centre of its large shadow. Unlike Clannad, where those character arcs are mainly devoid of any fantasy, half of the character arcs in Little Busters have a fantasy element which is not explained whatsoever. This is particularly jarring in the last character arc, in which a deus ex machina saves the focused character in the most ridiculous way possible. The secret of the world plot seems to be, curiously, the main story yet it\u2019s rarely touched upon and may as well been the entire series. Little Busters suffers from too much going on and the Key Syndrome didn\u2019t give it the factor that it needed the most.\\n\\n\r\nThe unfocused plot becomes somewhat problematic when other characters are introduced, which is another problem with the series. Usually, a great plot is complemented with great characters, as both the story and characters stick with the viewer. With its messy plot, Little Busters\u2019 characters can\u2019t complement the story whatsoever, rather complement each other. Instead of introducing a character for the sole purpose of having a character arc about them, Little Busters did something that would\u2019ve worked tremendously if the story wasn\u2019t unfocused \u2013 introduce the characters long before they become a main focus. In their introductions, they\u2019re usually the focus which allows the audience to get to know them better, allowing you to care for them later on.  Not all of the characters get an arc to themselves, such as Kurugaya who acts as a voice of moral reason and always wants to be surrounded by the rest of the female cast (she pilots the Yuri plane). Little Busters\u2019 characters are the most endearing part of the entire experience, brought down by its riddled story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style and music is something that\u2019s\u2026 not exactly worth mentioning. It\u2019s the same studio as Angel Beats so the characters retain that style, which isn\u2019t exactly bad but it doesn\u2019t scream fantastic: it\u2019s a very colourful art style that isn\u2019t dull, yet also isn\u2019t impressive at the same time. The music is something that could be called forgettable. The opening and ending themes are alright at best, nothing too inspiring but the music cues are usually overshadowed by Riki\u2019s annoying narration every ten minutes or just casual discussion. This is one of the factors where it doesn\u2019t try to be Clannad, though perhaps it should\u2019ve been. Clannad\u2019s music was so touching and memorable: it made it stand out. Little Busters is, unfortunately, weak in both of these areas. It\u2019s taken its cues from areas that already needed some improvement.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters one-ups Clannad in one factor though: humour. Little Busters seems to be a lot funnier than its older sibling, which ultimately is brought by it\u2019s interesting characters and their mannerisms. Kurugaya will always coin a lesbian joke here and there, yet it involves herself; that not only seems appropriate but also hilarious given the comedic situations that ensue later. One of the characters, Masato, will usually get into a fight with another character. This is played for laughs, as Ryousuke will ask the other students to throw any item that can manage to get their hands on, which usually ends badly for Masato, who is usually given a gag weapon, such as soap. This does happen often during the course of the series, though it\u2019s funny every time to see him defeated in a different way every time. Upon defeat, the victor gives him a name which upon he will be called for the rest of the day or longer. It\u2019s one of those occasions where, despite being in another language, the humour crosses over well with western audiences.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters isn\u2019t a bad experience, dare I say that it was actually enjoyable. However, the fantasy feels very misplaced, as it shouldn\u2019t really exist in the first place. The story was all over the place, it lacked a true central focus and the art and sound isn\u2019t the best you\u2019ll ever see. However, the characters are the best part of the entire series, some of the themes in the character arcs are actually endearing, which is a shame since it seems like they should be the main focus of the whole thing. The ending isn\u2019t complete, though a second season is on its way which will basically be Littler Busters: After Story (though it\u2019s called Refrain). In the end, Little Busters will have you remember its characters, it\u2019s funny moments and its charm. With the preview at the end of the final episode, we can only hope that Little Busters: Refrain will be even better.",

This seems to be one of the better Key adaptations, so far it seems to be on the same level as Angel Beats, So its pretty good. The story revolves around Riki a boy with Narcolepsy and his gang of friends as they try to form a baseball team..... It sounds weird I know that's cause it is. Riki himself is a pretty flat character, his friends on the other hand are weird as shit. There's a sexy insane boy, a girl obsessed with cats, crazykendo kid, and then the strong spazy kid. They all balance themselves out pretty well too. If slice of life/ drama is your thing then Little Busters! is for you.",

            "content": "Did people watch this show and expect there to be a romance? Haha! I didn't even realize that the show's tag had romance until I finished the show. Which means I wasn't shipping any characters and expect them to be all lovey-dovey towards each other. I also didn't read the VN version and never will. \r\n(There will be some SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (5/10) (SPOILERS)\r\nThe story is not that interesting or even mind-blowing. The show focuses on Rikki as he tries to recruit more people for the \"Little Busters\" which is the name of their group and their recently created baseball team. I won't gowith his past life, flashbacks, or his conditions. The show focuses on 2 main things. The 1st is him recruiting more people for the \"Little Busters\" and the 2nd one is Rikki and Rin trying to solve the mysterious letters that they have been getting from a cat named \"Leon\". \\n\r\nLet's focus on the first one. Yes, Rikki successfully recruits more people which is mostly girls because their boy-to-girl ratio was 4 to 1. What happens after he successfully recruits a girl? What you get is 4 character arcs with forced dramatic moments and melodramatic moments. I mean, the character arcs did make me cry...a little bit... but one of them is just plain horrible and what's worse is all the character arcs are rushed. The arcs lasted for only 3-4 episodes. One of the arcs had some laughable ending that didn't really make sense. For example, Mio's arc had some potential but they messed it up with some imaginary bullcrap and ending that just doesn't make sense.\\n\r\nAt least, the 3 remaining character arcs are good and it gave me a few emotional tears. The remaining character arcs that I loved are Komari's arc, Haruka's arc, and Kud's arc. I won't go in-depth with these arcs but all I will say is they're great to watch and will make you cry. Even if you're a man. Probably. \\n\r\nLet's focus on the 2nd one which is the \"mysterious letter\". I honestly don't know what the hell this is. Is this a filler or something? I just hoped that they solve the mystery letter and find out who has been writing that letter in the 2nd season. The mysterious letter is not the only episodes that happens in-between the character's arc. There are also some \"breather\" episodes that are just for the laugh and giggles. The jokes are repeated but they're still somehow funny. \\n\r\nI'm not even going to mention the ending. It's terrible. Did the creators run out of ideas or something that they couldn't come up with a decent ending. The post-credit scene did peek my interest and I'll be watching the second season just to check it out. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (7/10)\\n\r\nIf you have seen Angel Beats before then you'd notice that the animation is very similar. The animation for AB is obviously better and I am not being biased here. Yes, I watched the 1080p version for both shows but let's not get on that. The show's animation suffered from lack of details to crappy character motion, etc. It's not a bad animation but it's not great either.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]: (6/10)\\n\r\nI can't believe they used the same opening for 25 episodes straight. This is one of the few animes where I was hoping that they change the OP as soon as possible but sadly, that didn't happen. I just skipped the OP after episode 8. The ED theme song is also horrible and I only listened to it for 1 episode only. The background themes are decent. \\n\r\nI watched the show in English Dub so I'll be reviewing the English voice acting. All of them did a terrific job and I loved most of the VA's except for one voice actor. The English VA of Rikki annoyed the living hell out of me. He sounded like an annoying teenager who hasn't dropped his balls yet for whatever reason. I know, he was voiced by a girl, that's why he sounds like that.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]: (8/10)\\n\r\nI loved every single character in the show except for one. That's the main protagonist. Riki just isn't that interesting of a guy. He's just a nice main protagonist guy that I somehow don't like. Does he have redeeming qualities? Hell no. He just goes around, helping and fixing the girls' problem before they are recruited. Yes, every girl has a problem and Rikki \"fixed\" all of them. This is an example of a forced dramatic moments. Every single girl has a ridiculous past-tragedy and they must overcome it. With Rikki's help, of course. How the hell did they all end up in this school anyways. \\n\r\nThese dramatic moments are forced as hell but that doesn't mean I hated them. After seeing Komari's arc, Haruka's arc, and Kud's arc. The show successfully made me love these characters. Except Mio's arc. That arc was just terrible. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8/10)\\n\r\nMost slice of life today has a crappy story but I don't really care for the story. My enjoyment rating is 8 because the jokes are hilarious and the forced dramatic moments somehow worked. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (6.8/10) --- Rounding it to -- (7/10)\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a good anime series to watch. The show has a lot of flaws but the show also has a lot of good moments like the dramatic and emotional moments and the comedy episodes in-between. If you're looking for a drama series then you might want to check this out. If you're looking for romance as the tag suggests then don't watch this show. The show has no romance and that tag was just misleading. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Good Animation\\n\r\n+Great Characters\\n\r\n+Funny moments\\n\r\n+Dramatic moments successfully executed\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Mediocre Story\\n\r\n-Mediocre Soundtrack\\n\r\n-Unlikable Main Protagonist\\n\r\n-All female characters had a past tragedy\\n\r\n-Character's arc were rushed\\n\r\n-Terrible ending\\n",

            "content": "From the makers of Clannad and Clannad After Story comes the story of group of childhood friends who form a baseball team in a last ditch effort to create lasting memories before they all graduate and go their separate ways.  The main character Riki is tasked to find more members (preferably girls) to join their team The Little Busters.  However, beyond this simplicity lies much deeper subplots.  These subplots concern the insecurities and hardships of the new female members of The Little Busters.  Some are much more simple to comprehend immediately, while others are shrouded in mystery which isn't revealed untilthe last minute.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, the story was interesting and unexpectedly good.  This wasn't an anime that you could predict where it was going.  It had unique scenarios that were believable and emotional.  Where the anime stood the best was in its subplots.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as main characters go Riki is one of the first likable main male characters to exist in a show like this.  Usually, the main character has a mediocre personality and the viewer wonders why girls are so obsessed with him.  However, Riki is kind, honest, calm, and caring to others.  He puts other peoples' concerns in priority to his own concerns.  Moving beyond the main lead character, I believe the other main characters were great to.  It was good to see that the main lead didn't just have that \"one guy best friend\".  He had three others with outrageous personalities.  The main girls were great and had a lot to offer in the show.  Although at times I thought the voices of a couple of them were a little unbearable, each girl was unique and special.\\n\\n\r\nThe only objections I have to this show is that it didn't close some extremely interesting plot holes.  Who is sending the letters?  Why is Riki's narcolepsy so significant?  What is the secret of this world?  If the anime closed some of those holes I would have gave it a better grade, but ultimately I still think this is a good anime.  I would suggest it to those who are looking for slice of life, deep character development, and unique subplots.  I would highly recommend it to people who liked Clannad and Clannad After Story.",

I didn't really care about Key's works before, but this time I had to react. Let's start with the characters: they're all a bunch of stereotypes patchworks from the previous Key's works. I didn't find any girls interesting except for Mio and Rin. Mio's arc from the season 1 was the best one in my opinion, Kud's arc was the worst piece of shit ever.\nThe music was inspired by Wii Sports it seems, it didn't really bring me any sadness or whatever, and thecomedy-performance was really poor. I swear, I've never seen worse except for Clannad. And the story in general was very poorly written, this is really a generic harem except for some artificial extensions like baseball which brings this to a sport anime. \\n\\n\nLet's talk about the few arcs, the first one was about Komari. I really find the concept interesting, but in the end you get the loli's artificial crying and it made me fucking angry.\\n\nI remember the pink haired twins being probably the worst after Kud. And the pseudo-vice-president or whatever was playing tsundere so bad that it makes Haruhi Susumiya looks like a god. Mio's arc was really a piece of art, this character was credible because she reminded me of myself, the stuff about the self-preservation, the cultivation books and of course the yaoi was the best part.\\n\\n\nSomething really sucks about this show and would be the main-protagonist Riki: he's supposed to build a harem, but in your mind you'll think he's a girl (his voice is the most girly compared to the others girls); this is truly laughable. Of course the others guys are the essential factors for developing his \"virility\". Good luck in whatever they are doing!",

This is something that you should watch. The Anime ver. is not as good as the Game ver. .. Because there are a lot of information withheld here. Though it feels like cheating since I know the story through the game, which actually made me cry more than Clannad.\r\nSo for the objectives ... Story 8 / 10\r\nFrankly speaking, the Anime version toned down the \"Tear Meter\" a lot, it could have made more impact if the last episodehad shown the person who knows the \"Truth\" of the world. But the anime did a great job on the Comedy scenes, no problem with that.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10 / 10\\n\\n\r\nKey's art is one of the best IMHO, Still improving and going strong.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10 / 10\\n\\n\r\nNo, really. Since there is no more score higher than 10, the music here has a lot of meaning, same with Clannad and Angel Beats, though if I was asked which music is rated higher, then there is a clear distinction of #1 for Clannad #2 for Angel Beats and #3 for Little Busters! ...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10 / 10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the elements that keep the story going, being true to one's nature no matter the circumstances are, to improve throughout the series and make the watchers think about their own characteristics.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10 / 10\\n\\n\r\nIt could have been better but it easily made 10 for me. Every episode gives you another meaning of \"Watching\" though it is as expected because it is from Key. Crying, Laughing aren't the only feelings you'll feel when watching this, especially in the Refrain! part.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10 / 10\\n\\n\r\nStory may not have as much impact as the last two latest anime of Key but I swear that Refrain will make it up. Really, everything in the anime has a meaning (Well, maybe except for some comedy parts.). If you stopped watching this because you didn't like how it started. Heh~ I'm telling you... You really need to watch this in order to know what happens in the Refrain.",

            "content": "This review may contain quite the number of biased/subjective points on my part, but nonetheless may help to see the anime on a more personal level.\r\nThe release of the Little Busters! anime made me squeal, especially since I had no idea that there were plans of it! I've seen the opening of visual novel and while I never got around to actually reading it, Little Busters! charmed me with its music, lovable-looking characters and feelings of friendship.\r\nWhich are what I was expecting to see in the anime! \r\nNow, while I did get my pretty people, friendship theme and BEAUTIFUL music, I also felt somewhat... lacking/disappointed.While the introduction of the main five did move and lighten my soul, a few off bits started to become more obvious as the story progressed.\\n\\n\r\nThe most glaring issue that was stabbing at me was the lack of character development. I'm not exactly an expert on what 'character development' is supposed to be made of, but I know a good development when I start feeling FOR and WITH the character and not shedding a tear just because 'wow, that's sad'. Perhaps things just progressed too quickly, or perhaps the character personalities make realistic development a bit difficult, but I know that I wasn't feeling my heart wavering as much as it should during a certain character's arc. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, there are a number of 'filler' scenes that I can live without seeing. Gags and jokes are fine the first few times, but there's no need to keep doing the same thing just because the audience liked it before. Some comical scenes are also pretty empty and give off the feeling of someone 'trying too hard to crack a joke'.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, there are the character stereotypes and unrealistic reactions. It's difficult to stay interested in a character that you've seen in about a dozen other anime and while unexpected reactions can be pretty amusing, some unrealistic reactions are only worthy of an eye roll.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, while some of the characters' actions and reactions are unrealistic and surreal, the characters' thoughts and feelings are definitely real and relatable. This is what won me over. This is what I hoped to see and feel in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nRealistically, this anime is nothing special, nothing fancy. Nothing you'd want to lose sleep over. But emotionally, this anime speaks a lot. While our youth is definitely a time when we must enjoy and experience happiness, when we all should feel light and carefree, it's not always smooth sailing. Little Busters! shows how experiences and friendships can slowly mold the youth into the strong and capable people they can be, one little step at a time.",

            "content": "Why do shows wait till the last few episodes to get to the good part!?\r\n[Abridged version of the storyline: A group of friends' decide to make a baseball team to play. One of the boy's become in charge of bringing new members to the group. Each new members that he persuades to join are not exactly the happiest of the bunch. Behind the smiles, the hardship is hidden]\r\nThis show really disappointed me. Every week, as new episodes came out, I really thought the series would get better, but it didn't.  Here are the reasons:\r\n1) The main character, Riki, narrates way too much. When heexplains the situation to us, it really bores me to death. Usually, I like hearing the narrator tell us what is going on, but he basically pointed out useless information and I just wanted him to shut up. Riki honey, you need to stop talking! The narration, the voice acting, and the dialogues/ monologues swayed me away from this show.\\n\\n\r\n2) There are way too many supporting characters. You can't really focus on each character individually because the group is too big.\\n\\n\r\n3) All of the burdens are handed down to Riki. When any of the girls have a problem, it is Riki who comes to the rescue. This is a harem genre so it  definitely makes sense, but many people says this show is about friendship- no! All the other characters just tag along and watch silently while everything happens. They're like little ducklings following their mama- in this case Rikki,\\n\\n\r\n4) The art is fine. I was expecting it be nicer, but you get used to it. \\n\\n\r\n5) The execution of the storyline was poorly done. This was the biggest problem for me. After the first arc with Komari (the blonde hair with the squeaky voice) was finished, there was a huge gap where nothing happened (if I remember correctly). Yes, you do get new members to the Little Busters but that's about it.  I started losing interest really quickly. Furthermore, when the arc of each of the girls finished, the characters were really pointless afterwards. You won't get to see them as much. Seriously, the timing of the arcs were unbearable!\\n\\n\r\n6) The blue hair girl. Her arc was interesting. However, I must be really dumb because it did not make sense to me. Her problem was really confusing and unrealistic. I understand how Key loves putting surreal elements to their shows, but the explanation still does not make sense. Also, not everything can be tied down on the last episode; it is just too much!\\n\\n\r\n7) As for the character development, I did actually see Rin (the red hair girl) start to grow as the show went on. She had a little bit of personality change which is a good thing because she is the heroine of the show\u2026although; I would have liked to see her as vocal and active as Riki.\\n\\n\r\n8) The guy who was meant  to provides comic relief for the show was more likely to be the guy who brought utter silence to ones house. He was not funny at all. I know he is different from comedians in other anime shows, but I swear he made me hate the show more. Eventually, I tried forgetting that he existed just so I could watch the show. The anime did have potential for good humor, because I actually did laugh at episode 20 with the silly, funny rap song one of the characters created.\\n\\n\r\n9) None of the characters really appealed to me. In all honesty, the perverted female character was  one of my favorite\u2026 and she had no real arc! That is saying a lot because I don't like perverted characters. \\n\\n\r\n10) I don't regret watching it, but I do not think I will watch it again. One thing I did like was a simple speech about how sad people view other happy people. This was not an extremely significant part of the anime, but it resonated with me. It made me not completely hate it.\\n\\n\r\n11) The voice acting:  it took me a while to get use to some of the voices. I'm not usually picky about it, but I wonder if the dub can do better.\\n\\n\r\n12) I continued watching this anime because I read the BIGGEST spoiler of all time, and I really thought it was going to happen in this anime. At first I was mad that I learned about it, but it was the only thing that made me want to watch it. But at last, the spoiler never came to form. They hint it through out the series, but the arcs really swing you away from the main storyline, and I do not think that the last episode could ever do that spoiler justice. If there is a second season (which will probably be awesome judging from the spoilers\u2026look, I hated Clannad, but I loved After Story), I suggest you watch this for background information, but other than that, I don't know if you should watch it or not. It is up to you!\\n\\n\r\nI would have scored this anime a 6 because I didn\u2019t like it, but I gave it a 7 because the entire arc ended with a happy feeling and a (simple) message. This bothered me at first because I thought it was hackneyed, but I know if I had watched this a few years ago I might have enjoyed it\u2026\u2026 (Keyword: might have). \\n\\n\r\n[Update: April 7, 2013]\\n\r\nWhen I wrote the review, the only episode I did not watch was the last one. As of now, I have completed it. I still agree with everything I wrote. As I mentioned, it concluded with this feeling of warmth. It summarized what Rikki had done for everyone. However,  it foreshadowed the tragedy to come. It ended nicely, and I do crave to watch the second season when it does come out...i probably will enjoy it more! Oh The Anticipation! Watch this series if you intend to watch the ever-so-hyped second season: Little Busters Refrain! Why? Because this season seems like the  background information which tells us more about some of characters that will be relevant for the sequel.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Before I start, I\u2019m just going to say that this is my first review and I probably won\u2019t do that great of a job; and because I have not played/read the visual novel yet, I won\u2019t be doing any comparison.\r\nWhen it was revealed that J.C. Staff would be the ones to do Little Busters, I had a discussion with a friend of mine. She said that Kyoto Animation would do a much better job than J.C. Staff and that Kyoto Animation should be the ones to do all of Key\u2019s works. For the most part, I do agree with her.\r\nIn anime your true friends willalways be there for you no matter what, whether it is through depressing times offering you advice and helping you get back up on your feet, to laughing and just acting like idiots. \\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters has these elements, from having hilarious fights between Masato and the entire female cast to the more dark tone of the show. However, the comedic essence of the show outweighs how sad each arc (route?) can be making it hard for each character to tug on your emotions like Clannad and Kanon (2006) did. This is in my opinion due to the pointless filler that most people complain about. However, I disagree with it being pointless. True, it is not part of the main story but it is there for a reason, and that reason is to soften the impact (with comedy) of how sad and dark the next route is. It gives you a good laugh before hitting you again. But it might not need it due to J.C. Staff\u2019s terrible writing. Other than filler problems, I had problems with unanswered questions during Mio\u2019s story such as exactly who is Midori and she came to be as a person, and how Kyousuke knew what was going to happen with their team at the end of season 1. Despite Rin being the main heroine she is not the focus of the story nor does it even show that she is. \\n\\n\r\nDespite these problems I didn\u2019t get bored watching the show, and each character was able to develop in each of their routes (which some people might disagree with; but hey it\u2019s my review). The soundtrack from Key was still good and had no problems with it. This show tries its hardest to survive on symbolism much like Clannad did, but could have done a better job because some people I talked to found some of it confusing (like the rain in Haruka\u2019s route or the parasol in Mio\u2019s route). Overall it wasn\u2019t terrible but it wasn\u2019t amazing; and if you like works of Key you should watch this and try not to think too harshly of the show because, well, it\u2019s from J.C. Staff.\\n\\n",

            "content": "What \"Adolescence\" do you have?\r\nDo you remember \"Childhood\"?\r\nThe irreplaceable one existed there.\r\nI finally decide to write a review for this anime whilst still being quite torn as to how I feel about it. I watched Little Busters while it was airing and after it had finished I decided to play the visual novel as well. Now i'm not here to make comparisons as they are obviously both different. However after learning more about Little Busters and each character in the novel i'm not so sure as to how I feel about the anime because I liked watching it, it was sort of a slice oflife with some comedy elements about a group of friends playing baseball, it's nothing too out of the box so it was enjoyable, but after playing the novel and going in depth in each character's story I can finally decide how well this anime was adapted from the novel.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters we have our protagonist Naoe Riki, an average boy who happens to have narcolepsy, he belongs to a close group of friends who just randomly decide to form a baseball club to celebrate their last year in highschool together, and so begins the story of Riki and his friends as he wanders around school meeting new friends to join his newly formed baseball team.\\n\\n\r\nThis is just the premise of the anime, the reality of it is far deeper than what it looks on the surface. As Riki begins to befriend the other members he also starts to know about their past, their personalities and what has led them to become what they are today and almost acts as a detective, roaming around trying to find out more about his friends and trying to help them. \\n\\n\r\nEach character's story is told individually, meaning the anime focuses on one character to another as each episode progresses. I really appreciated the way they did this because they managed to keep the story flowing while still being able to tell us in depth what each person's story was like, much like in the novel where each heroine has a route, in the anime each character's background was thoroughly explained and summarized in a way that we as viewers could still feel connected to them just as good as in the novel, something that was a really nice asset and boosted my appreciation of this anime. I will go as far as to admit a few of the stories' conclusions made me tear as well as they did within the novel so I can't discard that fact.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the dramatic storytell element was there I feel like there should be one more element, something to fill this hole, I can't exactly explain element but it felt as if the anime focused on each main character's story and while that was really well told it sort of makes the viewer lose track of the main point of everything, it's as if the whole baseball and school situation didn't matter anymore and it's just there to provide a background to the whole dramatic show. I'm aware that unlike the novel the main characters aren't romantically involved which maybe if they were something might have felt different? I know they merely did this to avoid fan preferences and just kept the relationships neutral between the characters. But one thing that bugged me the most was the lack of answers as far as the side stories go, we have yet to know so much about what's actually going on and what's the \"secret of the world\", and this is a direct consequence of the anime focusing merely on the characters, this is the main flaw I find within the story and I really hope the sequel lives up to its name and fixes this empty hole left from the first season.\\n\\n\r\nStory aside, the next thing I appreciated in this series were the characters, each of them unique in their own way and really original as far as their personalities and individualities. Though at some points the anime almost becomes a harem because it's as if each of them is interested in the protagonist, although this leads to some funny situations I feel like it was uneeded if the anime itself isn't going to have romance it's kind of cruel to tease whoever is watching with scenes like that, this anime would have more potential had they focused on the characters and their friendships alone rather than giving hints of romance. Appart from the relationships within the plot the actual characters behave sort of stereotypically, there's a shy one, a loud one, a clumsy one, a smart one, and the list goes on.. Aside from the time where we're learning about these individuals it's almost as if we're looking at a completly generic cast. But since these downsides can only be seen briefly I can't stress it more than it needs so the balance is still positive plotwise.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's opening and ending themes were straight adaptaions from the novel to the TV series with few changes and to be honest I really liked these I still listen to the opening and ending theme of Little Busters so I have to give sound a good rating because it felt like reliving the novel and this applies the other way around too. As far as the art it's really sort of mediocre, there's nothing amazing about it there's nothing too flashy or outsanding it just passes today's quality standards but it won't leave the viewer disgusted with how it looks for sure so no one should have many complains about watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Little Busters seems more like a dramatic slice of life kind of anime than anything else, it was a good attempt to adapt from one of Key's greatest novels, for me actually the best novel they produced, but it came short because of the amount of elements they had to disregard when adapting this series, hence why this show can only be categorized as average. Nonetheless it's more than enjoyable and watcheable. I did not get bored of watching it at all, but while it can keep you watching it it also lacks something that reminds you of the show forever, something memorable is what this show needs. Believing in Key and possibily contradicting some things I might have said I stay true to this series after have gone through the novel and hold high expectations for the sequel to fill in the gaps this show left behind, if such a thing doesn't happen then this anime will lose all its credibility.\\n",

Watching all of that grooming translate into something powerful enough to defy death and change fate was really special to me. Connecting with every single character, laughing with them, crying with them; feeling like you\u2019reright there with them and actually in the show, part of the group is what is unique about this show. It does a phenomenal job of showcasing the themes of friendship, love, selflessness, and true compassion for others.

            "content": "(Note: This review is from a person who has not played the visual novel, so do not worry about any sort of tendentious opinions toward the VN.)\r\nLittle Busters is a somewhat old visual novel (released in 2007) made by the company Key. After five long years someone decided they should create an anime predicated on it. Key had made many other visual novels which would go on to become animated series, some of which I am a fan of. I find both Kanon 2006 and the Clannad After Story animes to be a fantastic way to get tears everywhere due to excessive crying. However, bothof those times (and every time if I'm not mistaken), Key's VN's were adapted by Kyoto Animation. Naturally, it would be fair to think that Little Busters would also be adapted by KyoAni, but no. For whatever reason, Little Busters got to be adapted by JC Staff, the same guys who made such animes as Nodame Cantabile, Azumanga Daioh, and Shakugan no Shana. So while many were upset to hear that KyoAni wasn't going to be doing the job ( it seems they were more interested in animating girls with eye patches and talking fat birds), I was not. In fact, I was rather excited to hear somebody else was given the baton this time around. So, how did they do? Well, looking at the numeric score, you can guess my opinion. \\n\r\nSo, if you've watched any of Key's other series, you'd know they all follow a similar archetype. 1) Introduce a male main character who's somewhat faceless. He doesn't really have any particular talents or interests, but lacks any obvious faults. He's usually indifferent toward most situations going on around him, but when things get rough, he's there to shine. A nice jack-of-all-trades guy that most everybody can relate to. 2) Introduce a handful of female support characters, each with their own quirks. Maybe spend a couple of happy-go-lucky episodes that let the viewer get to know all these ladies. 3) Show several plot arcs, one for each girl. Each arc will toss that girl into some horrible plight, and it will be up to the dashing main character to save her from her despair. \\n\r\nNeedless to say, Little Busters doesn't stray far from this blueprint. Our hero, Riki, can be summed up with my description above, along with the quirk that he also has Narcolepsy. Little Busters also has many women, and is split up into several story arcs, one for each lady. It's a storytelling framework that works great in VN's since for each play through you embark with the intent of winning the heart of a different girl, and the main character being sort of a blank slate allows you to put yourself in his shoes. As for anime, I don't think it really works all that well. Each arc feels very separate from both the arc that came before it and the one that succeeds it. Besides the first arc and finale, you could probably watch the arcs in any random order and not notice much difference. In the past, discontinuity like this didn't bother me at all, but now that I'm a fractious college student, it doesn't fancy me too much.\\n\r\nOn to the story, Little Buster's first introduction arc seemed unusually dull and lengthy. While other Key animations rely on getting through this first arc with lots of humor (with Clannad having the best jokes in my opinion), Little Busters doesn't hit the mark. It's main form of humor comes from the character Masato either exclaiming ridiculous one-liners, most usually related to his own muscles, or the same Masato getting picked on by other members of the cast. Maybe some found it funny, but I didn't. The character introductions were clean, but forgettable, and nothing particularly spectacular nor memorable happens. The first few episodes were a chore to sit through.\\n\r\nThe character arcs, with the exception of maybe one of them, were actually pretty bad. How were they bad? Well, they tried too hard to be sad, but in the end wound up just feeling forced. Characters would erupt in tears or unleash wild swings of emotion, but I'd find myself unable to understand their feelings. In an especially bad case I recall, an episode has one of the girls introduce her favorite bench, only to have it get destroyed moments later. During the bench's dismantling, the girl is very passionate, with lots of screaming and shouting, ya know, what you'd expect. This scene came suddenly from nowhere and was extremely unsuccessful at getting me to understand the girl, which was the scene's goal. It felt very forced, with absolutely no foreshadowing at all hinting toward it. In general, this is how I felt most of the time while watching the show, which I found very surprising, especially considering how emotionally involved I got while watching other Key animes.\\n\r\nIt wasn't all bad though. There were several stand-alone episodes that I found very entertaining to watch. Those episodes usually occurred between arcs and were a nice break from all the forced drama. Some of those episodes that were memorable to me included the episode everybody helps Kud study for an upcoming exam, and the episode where Riki sneaks into the girl's dorm to have a slumber party. Those episodes were nice and 'slice-of-lifey'. If only the actual arcs were as enjoyable as those episodes... \\n\r\nAnyways, after twenty five episodes, the anime reaches its final episode, which I got to see just a few hours ago. How was that?              \\n\r\nDangit, that last episode left me with little but deep dudgeon.\\n\r\nThe series had spent several episodes building up a subplot I'll dub 'the secret of the world subplot', and then the penultimate episode strongly tinctured that something was fishy about Kyousuke, one of the main characters. I was really excited to see the final episode bear fruit to all this buildup, but nope. It was just Riki and friends giving an adumbrate of all the previous episodes, followed up with a montage of their baseball match (not to mention a sudden and unexplained 180 degree flip of Kengo's personality).\\n\r\nLooking back, I can't say I really enjoyed a whole lot of this show. Several standalone episodes (in particular the aforementioned penultimate episode) were very enjoyable, but the actual arcs were not. They were too forced, just trying to be too dolor. In past Key animations (specifically Clannad AS), often if a character would start crying, I would find myself crying with them. The pathos the writers were trying to convey to me successfully connected, and I could truly empathize with those characters. Most of the time with Little Busters, I felt immured from the situations at hand. Most of the time I simply could not understand the struggles the characters were experiencing. Sometimes it was because my suspense of disbelief was absent due to strange and unbelievable scenes, but most of the time it was simply from poor pacing and writing. With the announcement of a second season, I don't really see why the decision was made for these arcs to have such a rushed pace. I have heard that some of these arcs omitted a lot of important scenes from the VN, hindering the overall quality. That just seems silly to me. They should have just followed the base source more closely and pushed an arc or two into the second season. Little Busters has a huge fan base, they really shouldn't have had any fear of it not being popular enough to get a continuation, especially if given the detail and care it deserves. \\n\r\nBut whatever, I'm done speculating. Overall, the art is nice, no real complaints. The sound is good, though I really wish they made a new opening and ending halfway through, particularly one that didn't use a song I'd heard long ago in a nico nico douga. The characters were good, but I wish more growth was given to the male characters. Kengo suddenly completely changes character in the last episode, Kyousuke stays cool yet phlegmatic from start to finish, and Masato never becomes anything more than comic relief. Riki grows plenty, but he's the main character, so it's to be expected. The story left a lot unanswered, but with the promise of a second season, it is my hope that those questions will be solved, and solved well. This adaptation wasn't spectacular, but it wasn't trash. It had plenty of good parts, but in the end it leaves me wondering how it would have turned out if KyoAni had adapted it instead. Oh well, I guess we'll never know.",

            "content": "Let's talk Little Busters, shall we?\r\nAs always, i'm basing my review on the animated production alone, no bias ;)\r\nOnto the matter at had, what struck me at first when i watched the show was just a simple Slice of Lice/School/Comedy vibe, which - as a fan of Slice of Life anime seemed pleasant to me, but as i watched, i came to feel the emotional power that the show bears, and rather than being taken on a physical journey. it started to set me up on an emotional one - not an easy task either.\r\nThere are a lot of requirements that this show fulfills tobe able to convey emotions the way it does. Clearly, the vibrant art and the superb character designs help, but the tactic of the show is ultimately to get you into truly understanding each of the troubled characters in depth, and so it substitutes an intricate plot, for the establishment of powerful bonds between the viewer and the characters. Now this isn't on par with everyone's tastes, but it's a well known set up for real life themed anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe back stories, or the \"context\" of the characters if you will - make up the most part of the show, and i for one couldn't be happier that this is the case. In terms of content, the stories and setups behind the characters, and the characters themselves come off as well thought out, and genuinely interesting - though often very tragic.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the show, the main character (Riki) - with help from the rest of the team is able to connect with the stars of the show, getting to know them on a very personal note, so as you watch you'll keep reconsidering how you feel about each character, personally i found it hard to pick a favorite!\\n\\n\r\nDrama!\\n\r\nDrama!\\n\r\nDrama!\\n\r\nIs a big theme in the show, it goes hand in hand in this case with the emotional troubles of the characters, and the friction involved in dealing with them. \\n\\n\r\nBut this isn't just some sort of sob story show - the main theme constantly referred to is friendship, and being there for one another, ultimately it is the viewers duty to root for the little busters to get through everything with the help of each other, and so it's not going to get you down or anything (for long)...\\n\r\nIt is a great balance of putting you on the edge, and allowing you to enjoy, not too this, not too that! :)\\n\\n\r\nAs if i hadn't already sold this to you, i did come to find some cryptic and supernatural elements to the show, adding to the show's ability to take you by surprise, because often the goings on can't be anticipated.\\n\\n\r\nI DO have criticisms though...\\n\r\nI've got to admit, i found the \"one after the other\", order to going into each characters' past to be frustrating, it definitely detracted from the spontaneity of the production, some more transitional content would have helped. My other concern: the lack of character development (to the degree provided for some of the others) for the male characters, but you could argue that it's just my curiosity to find out more kicking in now xD \\n\\n\r\nI'd like to point out that this has been the first show i've found to have a true emotive power, so pardon me if my etiquette for dealing with this style isn't perfect.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, i definitely recommend this to you - particularly if you're ok with slice of life. The show has a little bit of everything it seems, and i found it really enjoyable, i hope you do too.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Notice: You should not expect too much from this like I did simply because its producer is the same as Clannad's, so here goes my first attempt... to tell people why I think this Anime is so so bad.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story in an overall view does not connect at all, it feels like the plots are just randomly put together. Even if there's supposed to be a sad scene, the transition is so bad that the plots cannot bring up the full feeling at all. My dedicated friends said it is supposed to be game-style plots, meaning this Anime goes the same way its visual novel(game) do, that tells us where its randomness comes from. This I think is why Little Busters is REALLY REALLY sad (bad)!\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt's really nothing to say about art after seeing how the story was, but overall the art has only a few points to praise about. The Moe of course is most people focus on. Even though the feelings are not brought up properly, at least the art was more or less on the spot. You see, the average quality of art may just be the thing that pushed me to watch LB for 17 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWell... maybe it tried to be like Clannad or not, it did an okay job to use some good BGM to bring out the mood/atmosphere here and there as it is supposed to. All I can say is, Little Busters... This Anime... it really has tried its best doing things right. That's all LB tells me as I watch the Anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nBasically, the introduction of different characters are just simply RANDOM. Little Busters does not provide a good background telling you how each character came to be. It does not tell you in enough details that why it is important that this group of people got together except probably one simple scene in the whole 17 episodes. The interaction between characters, the lines they say, seems to be completely random and off-topic to me as well. This Anime does not seem to be organized at all in its characters as well. The behavior of the characters is also not supported by anything, even a simple background would do, but there was simply no such thing. In other words, characters are just as confusing as the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDon't think I need to say more about enjoyment. This randomness of story with randomness of Moe kind of create an Anime that is just below average or further below average. I have not been disappointment in a while now, considering I expected a bit since it's a Key production. I did not understand what the producers were thinking, putting this Anime out here to be judge. People would like this simply because it's plain (probably ignoring the randomness of this Anime) and it's somewhat slice of life, but an unorganized Anime is just... no good to me, I won't enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI would not recommend this Anime. It's not even enough for a time-waster when you run out of Anime to watch. You may just get annoyed as much as I did as the Anime progresses more and more... wait, is there even a progress at all?!! Lol Be aware of this work. If you expect this from Clannad perspective, you will be upset even more because it's nothing like it. If you do not put up any expectation from referencing Clannad, you will be disappointed just a bit less. Regardless, do not expect too much from watching Little Busters.",

            "content": "\"Little Busters!\" is a series that, at first glance, will seem like a typical cute comedy, but once you get into the series, you become hooked by the story as it is one that is far from predictable.\r\nTo start, the visuals are very cute and very pleasing to the eye. Where they aren't entirely beautiful, they still work for the type of story that is being told in the \"Little Busters!\" series. Along with the art, there is incredible music and sound that comes into play. Certain types of music play at just the right time, and although it's generally the same songs for certainevents, they still pull you in with ease to tie you into the emotion that is being provoked at that given time. There are a few tracks that become quite notable and memorable once you start to get into the series and understand its elements. The voice actors do not fall short in playing their roles either. They play the tone of their character with pristine accuracy, and their tones are able to shift whenever necessary. Although, there are some moments that do feel a bit over-played, as in feeling a bit too forced and feeding too much into a certain slice of life stereotype.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very well written, in my opinion. Many of them are very relate-able, some consisting of prominent real life struggles that aren't typically portrayed in a positive light in a lot of media. The characters are filled with an air of positivity and altruism, and their stories are very well written and portrayed with few plot holes. The story as a whole as a very concise and continuous story, and any questions that might arise are answered thoroughly throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe series as a whole has fantastic humor, cute characters, and moments that pull the viewer in, catching them on a hook. It was a series that I wound up binging for 2 days straight because of how much it had me hooked with the characters, the art, the story, and the overall entertainment of the show. Although there are some moments that may feel like a stereotypical slice of life anime, it's an outstanding series that can catch you off guard in the blink of an eye.",

            "content": "I see that a lot of reviews are calling the first season of LB mediocre, but I don't think that is the point, if anything, I think this season did a decent job as a prequel to the LB~refrain~.\r\nThe story was mediocre, I agree, there was not really a climax and there was so much hole in the plot, the ending was not at all satisfying. But to remind, this is a prequel. I've watched LB with the knowledge that it has season 2 so that all the lacking elements I noticed was bearable, it means I have to expect an answer to its subsequentseason. What this antecedent show did was introduce the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes a story more relatable to the audience is the indepth look at the personal lives of the characters, that way we can grow more understanding and attached to their circumstance. Though there was much more that should be recognized, the story was able to show what makes our character cry, regret, sad, weak... etc. Those traumas that makes these lives drawn together are well illustrated in the different arches. If it weren't for these sketches I don't think Refrain would be as much given credit. This season should be given acknowledgement for its wonderful job of giving profound construction into leading us to its sequel.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good. No complaints there. The sound was too. The tracks did their job into setting the mood, it actually reminded me of Clannad and the OP and ED is more enjoyable listening too than in the second season to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're finding a story here, don't. As I've explained earlier the story is not really the highlight of this season, it is character introduction. It is unfair to compare it to Clannad, because when you do it would lose the more meaningful and emotional story it should exude, it is too much of a comparison. If it becomes too mediocre do not worry, the elements will come together with the second season. The more you get serious into watching this prequel the more it would be personal for you when you watch the sequel.",

But it is little different from keys other visual novel . Although romance was present in VN , but anime adaptation focus more on Friendship and comedy . So if you are looking for any romance moment , this anime is not for you .\r\nMale to female ratio is good ( 4 : 6  ) , and the comedy part is done nicely . There are some few supernatural element present . Soundtrack again is one of the strongpoint . This is my fav track - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNwE4Rzx_gc . Only problem in this anime is lack of character development for some girls . It wasted 9 episode on single girl , but only 2 on the other girl which was my favourite  . The story is divided in 4 arc . overall 8/10 . The sequel \"little buster refrain\" that is currently airing is very popular . Some are saying it to be as great as clannad After story . If they manage to adapt VN appropriately , then this is easily one of the best slice of life anime .",

The story with Nishizono was really sad and touching, in fact most of the characters developed had a very sad background. \r\nOne of the funniest series I've ever been through too. Some really interesting points in Little Busters is when Rin gets agitated and grows a temporary pair of neko mimi XD \r\nKud have a really self developing meaning behind her life story. Morality in kud's story is really damn high. It even involve war! \r\nOst from Little Busters are really charming and sad both at the same time. OST-TwoSugars, is one good example of sadness and happiness SHIAWASE in one simple tune.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is produced by Key's,  so you can expect the same art and same uniform over and over again. Much like Kyoani.\\n",

            "content": "As a disclaimer i have played some of the VN although i'm reviewing this based on the anime itself taking into consideration the existence of a sequel.\r\nLittle Busters! is a very special anime one that could have been a master piece but unfortunately was not executed perfectly in my opinion. Still the efforts show a solid show at the end which makes for a great show following similar vibes to other Key series with a twist.\r\nThe beauty of Little Busters! lies in the fact that is fundamentally different than other anime out there. While other shows rely on complex character relations for romance and ecchifor comedy, Little Busters! relies on character development and a scent of nostalgia for our childhood days. (There is still ecchi but definitely less than anything out there nowadays)\\n\\n\r\nFor me, Little Busters! strikes right in my teen days. Days with not much responsibility other than studying. I deeply cherish those days of careless and idiotic fun and Little Busters! bright them back alive. It's innocent and naive; it might have some execution mistakes but you can't help but to fall for it's charm. I guess it's like watching little kids, they might be clumsy and sometimes you might not understand them but at the end it's a lot of fun and you can't help but to relate to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe most serious parts comes in the sequel which i'm also going to review but this part does feature around 4 arcs which would last about 3 episodes each and will have a good degree of impact and will serve to increase curiosity in the more important arcs on the sequel. (don't expect things to make sense here the sequel will tie everything up).\\n\\n\r\nOn a more technical side Little Busters! tries to be too much like a visual novel in some parts and not enough in some. adapting all the arcs in one timeline makes for a rushed sensation whereas some of the clear VN elements don't need to be there. the Art needs a little bit to get used to since it's different from other Key series (this was not made by KyoAni) and the ost although great to set up the mood can be repetitive. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I still greatly recommend this series is a refreshing series that focuses on friendship and really brings the characters together and develops them. I enjoyed this a lot and wish that times like those could really last forever.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! :)",

            "content": "Little Busters! at first glance you might think it looks plain. But you'll find out that hidden behind the simple looking cover. You find something is so much more than basic in any way shape or form and uses the element of foreshadowing brilliantly.\r\nThe Story revolves around one main character, this character has gone through something that ended up in him having Narcolepsy and being alone most of his childhood he ends up finding a special group of friends and throughout they're childhood they start to call themselves The Little Busters!. During the first portion of this series the small group that was Little Busters!expand into a rather larger group of friends and companions and a bit of love interest near the end. Also with a Secret to the world that needs to be discovered. Brilliantly executed and beautifully designed in every which way I cannot say anything bad about the story in general.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art Style is nothing different compared to other anime in anyway shape or form. it's also a quite a nice art style if you ask me and I think rather gives a comedic relief to the story sometimes, being a bit on the cartoon-ish side.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music for Little Busters! isn't the best in my opinion. It's not really remember-able but it's not bad by any means.\\n\\n\r\nThe Character design is pretty normal when it comes to School related anime. You have a shy girl,muscle man,a group leader,mc,a girl with a past,foregin girl,a calm guy and few more I believe that I can't think off hand. All of these generic traits for anime characters are brought out quite well and in no means lesser the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo forth after watching Little Busters! I was quite pleased. Overall was a brilliant story that I could see wasn't complete. So I went to the second season which in my opinion is even better and the best word to describe this anime is Brilliant because at certain points you end up being speechless at how things are done.    :D",

            "content": "Little Busters is a great anime by Key, the same people that made the best animes like Clannad, Angel Beats, Kanon, and Air. It follows the same principle of the other Key anime: what I like to call 'trust-and-then-devastate', where you first make relatable connections with each and every character in the anime and then that is followed by something devastating happening, causing you to actually feel empathetic, rather than just sympathetic. Each character has his/her own arc in the storyline and is built upon greatly. It feels like you've known that person for years. Every arc has a beautiful rising and falling action andleaves you satisfied. Throughout the show, many different feelings are thrown at you, to the point where you are yelling at your screen. The art in this anime is beautiful. Having seen the other older anime, like Air and Kanon 2006, you can see that Key has truly come a long way in their artistry. The backdrops are amazingly well defined, with a realistic but true-to-anime art style. You can see the shimmer in each and every character's eyes, and those very eyes speak to you. You not only see, but feel a difference that you won't be able to put a finger on until you realize that the youthful shimmer in the character's eyes was all that was missing. The music is some of the best I've heard. Thanks for that go to Jun Maeda, the god of anime soundtracks. The Key Studios record label, in cooperation with Jun Maeda, composed beautiful eye-welling pieces for Clannad, Angel Beats, and Little Busters. The suspense build-up in this anime is so great, it had me sitting in class at school the next day, just wondering what would happen next. I highly recommend that you watch this anime, especially if you loved the aforementioned Key anime or others like 'Toradora!' or 'Kokoro Connect'.",

It has a few character arcs but I wouldn't necessarily classify that as story. (If you want to get into the real soul-destroying story, the second season, called Little Busters! Refrain delivers that)\r\nThe soundtrack is nothing spectacular but it's a good quality. The voice acting is decent, definitely not untolerable. The art is a clean,standard modern anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, this is a character anime. There's not much in the way of story but the characters are so entirely fleshed out and all very enjoyable and that's where the real charm of this series comes in.

Staff. Yes you are right! Kyoto Animation didn't participate in this show. \r\nStory: 7\r\nRiki is a member of Little Busters together with Kyousuke, Rin, Masato and Kengo. In highschool they decided to recruit female members so that they can play and form a baseball team. Somewhere in the middle of the story Rin and Riki are receiving those letters from the cats which aresaying the existence of a \"secret world\" and assigning them tasks they have to complete.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art is fine. J.C. Staff did a fine job here. The characters are drawn smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe Opening and Ending song by Rita is forgettable. Unlike the other previous Opening songs for Key which is dramatic that gives you the feels when listening to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe characters are good. They have different stories in this show. The only problem is that they only have 2-3 episodes for each arc of them. Not enough for a character development. Some are annoying with those \"wafuu\" lines.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nHonestly I want to drop this show. But when I heard that there is a sequel which is Refrain I tried my best to finish the show even though it's super boring and cliche.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nI recommend you to watch this first if you are planning to watch the sequel. This may help for understanding the background stories and character development. Wasted potential. \"IF\" only KyoAni adapted this, it will be a another masterpiece in my list.\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this show, then this show is for you. :)\\n\r\nThanks for the feedback! >.",

            "content": "So here we have it: Little Busters!, another anime adaptation from \"Key\". With that being said you already know what you get yourself into...the dramatic stories of Jun Maeda.\r\nWell...this isn't the case here...\r\nThe name of the anime takes the name of the group that is presented in this show.Little Busters is the name of the group that contains five young friends that just want to have fun.\r\nLittle Busters! starts off in a high school in Japan, presenting us two of the main cast : Inohara Masato and Miyazawa Kengo fighting for whatever reason , while the third character , Naoe Riki , tries to stopthem. At this moment we are presented the next character , Natsume Kyousuke , a third-grader who seems to be the leader of the group , and later we meet her sister and the last from the main cast , Natsume Rin.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the adventures of these five characters as they want to have as much fun as possible before Kyousuke graduates from high school and so end up starting a baseball club. The story is presented through Riki's eyes as he gathers new members for the club. We soon see that each member he \"recruits\" has a dark moment in her past and so he starts helping them into overcoming whatever is holding them back.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important part of the story is actually the one that revolves around Riki and Rin. A cat keeps bringing them letters with different tasks they have to do...the reward by completing this task would be that they could find out \"the secret to this world\".\\n\\n\r\nBeing done with the starting phase lets get into the actual review.\\n\\n\r\nSo Little Busters! already has some mystery in it which will keep you watching until the end and make you crave for more. The story is formed from a number of arcs , one for each side character, and then there is the main storyline presented into different stages of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nYet...the strong point of this anime are it's characters. They are so well build and unique , and over that the writers made it look like they are real friends, a hard thing to accomplish in the anime world. All of the main casts are friends before starting the anime. The new characters however have one common problem: they don't seem to have any friends. Really...all of the side casts are lonely...like Riki has a magnet for those kind of characters. Let it be a robot-like all perfect and athletic student or a hyper-active trouble maker and sister hater, they don't have one friend at all.Each of them have specific traits and different ideals but in the end they all converge into the Little Busters because that one common problem.\\n\\n\r\nAnother think to notice is that even if it's storyline is dramatic and mysterious the show presents us with quite a bit of laughs. You can expect anything from this anime in this particular zone, don't think anything is too much for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the anime isn't something you can praise but you will live with it.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand soundtrack is something you can't live without. Well no really but it was really good. There are a couple of songs you can listen to even if free time.Also, this soundtracks are well placed to get you in the mood for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end...everything come down to personal enjoyment right?\\n\\n\r\nI liked the anime, and be sure I will be watching Little Busters!: Refrain soon.\\n\r\nWhat I liked about it is the way they present the bonds of friendship.The story is still a bit foggy but I hope it will be cleared in the next season.If you don't watch it for characters or storyline then the comic part is the last reason why you should watch it...",

Play baseball with friends, of course!\r\nThe story seemed fun at first glance, just some friends setting up a baseball team and it seemed to deliver pretty well... Until you realize that this was made by Key. Don't get me wrong, this anime had some heartfelt moments, just not up to the typical Key caliber. The anime ended itself pretty well and could have easily ended here, but I'm glad it didn't.\r\nIn my opinion, this anime felt quite a bit like a dating sim, as Riki is the only one gettingmembers for the Little Busters, hence him being the hero. He spends his time developing relationships and learning about the girls as it goes, triggering \"event flags\" as they have heart-to-heart moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very pretty, as some of the scenes made me just go \"wow\", such as the meteor shower and the sunsets. The character designs were unique in their own ways, though some were similar for various reasons, such as Kyousuke's and Rin's. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs were very nice, as I have put the opening on repeat many times and they add to the upbeat feel that is this anime. However, there are slower and sadder songs for the more important and serious moments in this anime, and trust me, there are a few. The voice actors did great with their roles, and gave each character a voice that worked with their personality and looks.\\n\\n\r\nI believe the characters were one of the best parts of this anime. Most of the characters were developed except for the main four excluding Riki. They did the developments well, giving each character a unique background and a special presence. The characters you were supposed to dislike were developed and made into something that you came to not hate so much. (Except for Sasami. She didn't get squat.)\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime. Even though it didn't have the energetic feeling that most comedy anime seem to have, but I liked this mood better as it made me feel warm and fuzzy inside. There were some hilarious moments along with fun characters that seemed to have their own quirks, like Mio's ability to have a camera whenever needed and quick to take pictures or Yuiko's possible homo/bisexuality. Or just love of cute things (Think this as you will.)\\n\\n\r\nSo what are you waiting for? It's on Crunchyroll now!",

I was excepting some light hearted friend fun but wow I got a lot. This show tore into my heart and presented me with all the things I wanted from a show but as it went on I saw everything I was attached to fade away. I like to really get into the shows I watch but for the most part it's just fake emotion but this anime really hithome for me. It was a wild ride but I am so glad that I watched it because I actually think it might have changed my outlook on life (crazy right). Anyway this review may seem blinded by my emotional reaction but my analytical side was also very impressed. The story is very neatly distributed and the ratio between comedy and drama is interestingly balanced. Truthfully I am impressed; this show pulled me in with it's slice of life air and my ideal tropes, then the immersion from that made the way the plot came together really stick with me. I know this is a show that will stick with me through the ages, and even if I grow to no longer like it I know the ideas explored in it will still have an effect one me.\\n\\n\r\n(Also like everything is really confusing for a really long time but you just have to stick with it. oh and like at one point i just wished everyone would become a bird so there is that...)",

            "content": "At the time of writing I have already seen Little Busters Refrain (the second season).\r\nSo I'll try and remain as spoiler free as possible, but the story isn't the primary focus of this anime more of the characters.\r\nStory I gave a 8/10\r\nThe story was good and emotional. It had a steady flow with appropriate pacing meaning that I was quite invested and in a longer series especially I find the pacing to rarely go along well.\r\nIt starts out very funny I was actually laughing and yelling at the characters like I was genuinely invested in what was going on but then a few episodes init take a 180 turn to be extremely sad and depressing. This is when you realize that its based off a Visual Novel (one I've never played) and that's important because of how the story flows, which was a gripe for me because sometimes the story seemed to not flow so straightly and at times had troubles making the ends meet in between arcs.\\n\\n\r\nBut this season they just leave you questioning to much to make it worth the 26 episodes you watch to make you more intrigued to watch Refrain (which is also very good and I feel that what I was complaining about had been fixed)\\n\\n\r\nArt I gave a 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nThis anime isn't going for the best looking anime around but nor does it feel like the animation doesn't fit in. I believe though that the way they animated it gave you more of a sense of connection to the characters and you can tell that some attention was paid to like during the baseball moments.\\n\\n\r\nSound I gave a 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't particularly stand out the sound track. But the voice acting was on point and gave the emotional moments the emotion they deserve and the funny moments the spotlight when they deserve it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter I gave a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really what make this anime unique. Each main and major supporting character in this anime have some backstory to speak of mostly something sad. The way the characters develop is what makes this anime so great they all have little quirks that make them fun and enjoyable though which is a nice way to see it because if all you've got is depressing characters the anime would have not been as enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment I gave a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's really hard to explain the enjoyment of this anime without spoiling it but it's funny but really knows how to hit you in the feels \\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt works great the formula and runs well with it I would comment about how the ending of this season isn't really desirable as you have to see the second season to get the full experience but it doesn't really get old during the first season and something kept me watching episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nThoughts I would find it hard to recommend to most people I talk to because of the serious matter of some of the matters they talk about like PTSD or Suicide.\\n\\n\r\nJacake",

            "content": "Little Busters, like its predecessors (Clannad, Kanon, Air), is a comedy-romance based in school life. The story revolves around a teenage boy (who is a somewhat chick-magnet) Riki Naoe who suffers from a sleep disorder, Nyarukolepsy. What generally happens throughout this series is solving problems for each female character (as seen in Clannad as well).\r\n\"A lot of people seem to blatantly hate it for the fact that it doesn't follow the original source material or won't even try watch it based on other people's hate towards it or because it's adapted by J.C. Staff and not traditionally KyoAni.\" - Veniamin\r\nIndeed, I agree with Veniamin. Unlikeits predecessors (which were animated by KyotoAnimation), Little Busters were animated by J.C Staff. Personally, I don't see why people actually hate it because of that, J.C Staff has adapted a lot of the best anime out there, for example Kaichou wa Maid-sama!, Hidan no Aria, Shakugan no Shana, Toaru Kagaku no Railgun, and as well as Toradora. Its not really the studio that adapts the anime that matters, more like how the anime is produced as the result. J.C Staff has done a great job with the animation of Little Busters, producing work of high quality.\\n\\n\r\nNot only did the anime excel in the animation, but the music too. The opening theme (composed by Jun Maeda, who also contributed in other anime which has the best songs, such as Angel Beats!), is reused in the anime as it was in the visual novel. The choreography in the opening theme demonstrates a breezy, happy atmosphere which carries the message of 'hope' and 'Keep looking forward!\" in it. Also, the opening has some introductory features to the characters as each character turn around to 'greet' the audience with such pleasure. Other than that, the soundtracks used during the course which undertook during intense scenarios are what I call, 'top-notch'. It is because of heart-aching soundtracks like \"Lamplight\" and \"Town of Incessant Rain\" I am constantly depressed. Anyway, the soundtracks and the opening theme deserve a big score, achieving a 9/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, even when the animation and sound quality has given a lot of potential to the anime, it all came crashing down for the storyline (atleast in my opinion). The storyline wasn't as captivating as it should've been, as well as it's inconsistency in keeping me engaged. It was a bit too slow in terms of reaching the rising action and the climax, spending its sweet time on character introduction, BASEBALL and a wee bit of fanservice. That being said, the anime DOES know how to make an audience cry, after all it is a Key Visual Novel. Unfortuantely, storyline (structure) is a no-go for me.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, I'll admit that spending alot of time on character development was worth it. Each character was well introduced, and each had their own personality and history. Voice actors and actresses had contributed the most in this department, this can be seen with the level of 'kawaii-ness' with Noumi Kudryavka and Natsume Rin. And so, character development is basically the highlight of the anime, along with sound quality and animation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was definitely worth watching, it was enjoyable yet intense at the same time. I recommend this anime for people who love the school-romance genre, or people who just want to kill some time or even for lolicons. Another thing, I personally think that the anime isn't something people would want to 'anime-marathon' on.\\n",

I recommend it to anyone who likes touching or funny anime's, although some of the characters life's were rough or tragic it made them who they were, i feel the plot was very interesting and the character traits for each character fitvery nicely.

In addition, some little but important details about \"the secret of the world\" are slightly revealed, so that I started guessing which was that \"hidden truth\". \r\nThe art is asbeautiful as in CLANNAD or the other shows I've mentioned before. Make sure to watch this show in HQ, if possible, it definitely deserves it! Concerning the OST, I couldn't resist myself to listen and relisten to the opening, sung by Rita. The ambient music is also pretty and calm. \\n\\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the characters are pretty complex and moving. I specially like the cheerful Haruka. In spite of that, some character stories could have been developed more in depth.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this has been an emotional and interesting anime which I really recommend.",

I've decided to try it with the series I most recently finished, Little Busters!.\r\nFirst of all, I've watched Clannad, Angel Beats! and Charlotte before Little Busters!, and so the Key formula was very familiar to me. I expected this to be similar to Clannad, given it is about the same number of episodes and is considered just something to watch before the \"superior\" sequel, the same as Clannad with Clannad: Afterstory, and I was pretty much right. I haven't seen Little Busters!: Refrain yet, though, so can't say anything about if it's better than this first seasonor not.\\n\\n\r\nGetting to the review...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nIt took place at school, like most anime. Very rarely were we shown other settings, as everyone stayed in dorms at the school and so had no reason to leave for the most part.\\n\r\nThe main story line was about Rin finding notes with tasks to do attached to one of her cats every now and then, with the promise that at the end she'd be told a secret to the world. Riki is always there right when she finds one, and sometimes helps. Usually, though, he's busy recruiting different girls with problems that get more and more serious as the series goes along to join the main cast's baseball club.\\n\r\nI hated the arc part of Clannad, and didn't like it here either. Many of the characters' arcs were really stupid, and there were supernatural elements that seemed to only apply to the given situations and not be questioned or mentioned again.\\n\r\nI've been spoiled a bit regarding the next season from Riki's character page, so I think maybe some of the logic behind the arcs' progressions might be explained in Refrain. Not sure.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters were nicely designed. Riki's face is the only thing that bothered me, with how unnatural and off it looked.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds were great. The baseball field, trees in courtyard, classrooms, ext, were quite good.\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, there was a bit of movement. Not much, though. A lot of just mouth changing. In the fight segments, where two characters fought using whatever they caught from what the other classmates threw at them, I'd always be disappointed since I'd expect some elaborate animation showing them using the different objects and yet it usually just cuts to the result.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe opening song and ending song both sound nice. They remind me of Angel Beats!.\\n\r\nThe videos accompanying them are quite interesting as well, though after seeing the opening a few times I skipped it after the clip showing each character one by one, and the ending after seeing it once I avoided since it was seen already and doesn't feel new or fun afterwards.\\n\r\nI downloaded it in dual audio, and switched between the Japanese and English versions a lot. Kud's Russian accent in the English dub was cringey, and made her serious scenes seem less serious with how ridiculous it was. Riki's voice sounded like a woman's in both versions. A lot of the girls had squeaky high pitched voices in the Japanese version, which was difficult to endure.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nI really liked Riki's character. I watched the first episode expecting him to be the typical weak guy who feels horrible about it and doesn't do much right, but that wasn't the case. Riki kind of accepts it and it's not a big deal, while he does what he can to help the others, his biggest problems being Kyousuke leaving by the end of the year and his narcolepsy, both not being major in comparison to what else goes on. The other characters have a main personality trait and a few quirks, based on their arcs, and that's it. At some point the female characters blended together in my head and I had trouble remembering who each were based on what their backstory was. Some development occurs with the characters, such as Rin being less shy and Mio feeling more comfortable around others.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nI was disappointed at the start, and kept taking long breaks between each set of episodes. The middle just made me want to quit, not finding the series worth the effort. In the end, though, I felt kind of happy. It was a feel-good ending of sorts, making my opinion of the series as a whole a bit better. Still, it was a chore to go through all 26 episodes, despite some being better than others.\\n\\n\r\nReview Overall: 6.4/10\\n\r\nI added up the scores and divided by 50 to get the final score's percentage.\\n\r\nThis might be different from what I have on my anime list, as it's more of an assessed mark than the score I give on my list after finishing the show based on how I felt about it at that point.",

            "content": "First let me just say this. Personally I found the first several episodes of Little Busters! a mix of enjoyable, but also kind of difficult to get through. Trust me - If you feel the same way while watching this series, you MUST keep watching. It's absolutely worth the time.\r\nStory: The story was amazing. Riki is a great main character that has unrivaled compassion. He's the center of the story and each chapter in this series gets more and more moving.\r\nArt: Much like Angel Beats and Clannad, Little Busters! has great art. It never lets down, there's never any noticeable slipups of animation. Just beautifulall around.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting is all very good, but it's the mix of music played at the right times that really stand out when it comes to the sound in this series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Definitely the most outstanding feature of this series is its cast of characters. So many members of Little Busters! and each of them is given plenty of screen time and development. You'll come to love all the characters just as I have.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the start can seem a bit slow... But please watch the whole series. It's definitely worth it. I loved this series... And if you read this review, I hope you'll read the review for Little Busters!: Refrain as well.",

(except Riki's voice is too girly in my opinion).\\n\\n\r\nFor me, I watched this just because I want to watch the 2nd season since it got a really high rating on MAL. I hope it would be like Clannad (where the 1st season is only good, but the 2nd season is a masterpiece).",

Im sure some will say that the show is boring itself, but question is, have you played the VN? There are alot of scenes from VN that wasn't adopted in the anime. So the anime is just like a summary for all the routes in VN. Thus even though, the show itself is really great. The mixture of drama and comedy that makes you from tears to laugh or both at the same time. Well lets just say like Tears of Joy lol.\r\nWell asfor the story, theyve really did a nice job for the summarizing the VN, cuz I played the VN and took me almost a week of playing to finish just one route.\\n\\n\r\nWell I recommend to watch the first and second season first before saying this anime sucks or whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of my Favorite Shows btw :)",

This in my opinion is a good story that which character development is used as the mover forward in the story as without it just be a group of friends doing random things, also several arcs in the story do focus on the major characterswhere you learn new things about them which makes you care for each character as well as making them unforgettable through the season although I did find myself forgetting about Kengo a lot of the time as he didn't stand out much. All the characters in Little Busters all have a wide variety of personalities and appearances which creates more interest into the development and history which can range from the smart and sensible Kyousuke, cute \\n\r\nKud and quiet, shy Rin which all have very out standing traits which make the show more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8 & Sound - 8:\\n\r\nThe sound of the show a nice fit that fits into the slice of life genre that it is with quiet soft music in the background that sets the tone for show as well other music that fits into different scenes good as well.

            "content": "Little Busters (26 Episodes)\r\nLittle Busters Refrain (13 Episodes)\r\nRating: 7/10 (Good)\r\nRecommendation Level: Stream It\r\nFirst crack at anime reviewing. These will be a little rough but I thought I'd take a shot at this genre of reviewing. If you like what you read, let me know in the comments below.\r\nAfter powering through this 39 episode series, I'm lumping the two seasons together, I thought I'd give a few thoughts on it. Because honestly, it's slightly conflicting.\r\nStory:\r\nThe plot of Little Busters is simple. A group of childhood friends, Rikki, Rin, Kyousuke, Masato, and Kengo, want to start a baseball team. Kyousuke is a third year in high schooland is looking to recapture his youth one last time, before he has to grow up. As time passes, they find new members to join their team to form The Little Busters! There's just one twist though. There's a secret to their world. And only Rikki and Rin can solve it.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, the plot is one of the weaker aspects of show. Or maybe not. What makes this hard to review is the story arcs. Almost every character gets some sort arc. There are some good ones. For instance, Kudryavka, a Russian transfer student has one of the best story arcs in the show. Then you get someone like Kurugaya, who's arc is on the weaker side and doesn't seem to affect the overall plot that much.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Busters tries to take a mix and match approach to its tone. Varying from serious, to comedic like, in an instant. Sometimes the serious tone engages the viewer quite well and you feel sympathetic for the characters. Other times, you can't become fully invested because either the arc is on the weaker side or it's trying to hard to be sad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nNot going to dive into this a whole lot, because there are way too many characters, but here are the main ones.\\n\\n\r\nRikki: The helpful one.\\n\\n\r\nRin: Shy, but determined.\\n\\n\r\nKyousuke: Strong and the ultimate leader.\\n\\n\r\nMasato: Physically strong, not the brightest.\\n\\n\r\nKengo: Wise, more secluded from the group.\\n\\n\r\nWhen these characters are together, it's a blast. And that's the real strength of the anime. Little Busters is about friendship. The characters work through problems together. They love, laugh, and play with no effort. This aspect really helps the viewer settle in with ease, as the episodes move forward.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is okay. It's nothing to brag about but the show isn't asking for a high quality. It's simplistic, most of the time, creating a subtle atmosphere with the overall plot and characters.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't watch this subbed, burn me at the stake if you must, but the dub is okay.... With Sentai being the licenser, you usually don't get a great dub. Mediocre, to bad, is where they usually lie. Let's just say, some of the voices work and then there's those few that don't.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the music was actually enticing. The first season opening is pretty memorable. You will probably sit through it a few times. Refrain's opening, not so much. The music throughout both seasons is pretty catchy too. But I might just be saying that considering I Netflix & Chilled this whole series in a day. So the music became stuck in my head after nonstop viewing. That might have something to do with it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something that will entertain you on the character front, this will do it. The plot will vary from person to person. Some of the best episodes are the filler ones. If that helps give you more of a perspective. The friendships developed are what hold Little Busters together. You'll laugh, you might cry, but you most likely won't be saying \"This isn't the greatest anime I've ever seen.\"\\n\\n\r\nLast Tid Bit:\\n\\n\r\nI didn't talk much about Refrain, because in doing so would give away spoilers, but Refrain is hit and miss. There's one episode that almost disregards all of Refrain's purpose. Majority of you will probably be go along the lines of \"Refrain is good, maybe a little better than the first season.\" Personally, Refrain is fine, but it's unnecessary as well. You could just stick to only viewing the first season and be just as well off.",
