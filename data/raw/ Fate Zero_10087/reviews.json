            "content": "Type-Moon have made a habit of finding success with their dark blend of magic and supernatural elements in modern day settings, but with the release of the Fate/Stay Night visual novel on the PC in 2004, the developer seemed to have found its flagship title. Unfortunately things never really work out the way people expect, and while Studio Deen's 2006 anime adaptation of the \"Fate\" storyline was well received by fans, many who were unfamiliar with the source material found it all a bit ... juvenile.\r\nAt the end of 2006 the developer began collaborating with Nitroplus in order to create a prequel light novel series,but this time the story was penned by the relatively unknown Urobuchi Gen (with Type-Moon co-founder Takeuchi Takashi providing illustrations). Set ten years before the events in the visual novel, Fate/Zero chronicles the events leading up to and during the fourth Holy Grail War in Fuyuki City, Japan - the same place where the battle will be held in Fate/Stay Night. After three successive failures in the contest, the Einzbern family recruits the notorious mercenary Emiya Kiritsugu, also known as the \"Mage Killer\" - a man who is willing to use whatever means are necessary to realise his goals.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, the other principal magic families - Matou and Tohsaka - are preparing for the coming conflict, and although the church is taking part as well, they have also sent someone to assist the Tohsaka family - Kotomine Kirei.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance it may seem as though Fate/Zero is just another action anime, but nothing could be further from the truth. The series has a very different tone than either Fate/Stay Night or Unlimited Blade Works, and in many ways it has more in common with the dark, brooding atmosphere of the Kara no Kyoukai movies. That said, the series does assume that the viewer has some familiarity with the franchise, but this is balanced by a much tighter plot than that of either of its predecessors, and more focus on preparation, planning, and even dialogue between the different parties. The result is that the narrative has far more depth and structure than one might expect in a supernatural action anime, and there are layers of subtext that are gradually added as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable aspects of Fate/Zero is that it's a far more mature story than the original visual novel or its adaptations, and unlike many other shows, there are very few occasions where the characters engage in pointless conflicts or endeavours. The series carefully tries to avoid insulting the viewer's intelligence by adopting a patient, methodical build-up to the action set pieces, and on many occasions the story focuses on information gathering and planning. In addition to this, the battle lines shift constantly as the combatants form short-term alliances in order to counter the moves of other opponents, but there's always the understanding that the foundation of these is nothing more than \"the enemy of my enemy\".\\n\\n\r\nIn truth, this anime has far better examples of tactics and strategy than anything found in Code Geass, and certain plots are Machiavellian enough to give Death Note a run for its money.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to production values, Fate/Zero could be considered the final evolution of everything Type-Moon and Ufotable have learned from each other during their long collaboration on the Kara no Kyoukai franchise. The series looks every bit as good as one might expect, and the darker colour palette is offset by the high standard of animation. That said, although the action sequences are fluid and very well choreographed, the real testament to the quality of Ufotable's work are the subtle differences in the way the characters move.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there are plenty of new faces in this prequel, it's actually the design of recurring characters like Sabre that really sets the standard. Fate/Stay Night's popularity turned her into one of the most iconic female leads in anime, but while she may appear to be exactly the same in Fate/Zero, there's an edge to her features and a preciseness to her movements that was missing in the original series. This fact is also true for the characters that are unique to this show, and even Tohsaka Rin's \"adventure\" has been given the same level of care and attention to detail.\\n\\n\r\nThe series opens with a well choreographed sequence that blends action with a montage of the main participants in the Holy Grail War, all set to the rather pacey rock song \"Oath Sign\" by LiSA. Each episode closes with \"Memoria\" by Eir Aoi, a bittersweet rock ballad that fits well with the images of the heroic spirits as pieces on a game board and at moments in their own history. Fate/Zero also has one of the most diverse scores in a 13 episode anime, with martial themes, operatic pieces, strange little tunes with drums or pianos as the major instrument, and more besides. The audio effects or of a very high quality, and the clash of steel on steel is as sharp and clear as the sound of the lightning whenever Rider makes a dramatic appearance.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the areas where Fate/Zero excels is the dialogue, and while there are occasions where conversations go on a bit too long, the script is intelligently written, rational, and insightful. One of the best examples of this is Rider's discourse on the true nature of kingship and Saber's reaction to it, but even that is nothing more than words on paper as everything lies in the delivery - so it's a good thing that the acting is of a high standard.\\n\\n\r\nKawasumi Ayako reprises her role as the King of Knights (Saber/Arturia) from Fate/Stay Night and Unlimited Blade Works, but her performance here is markedly different. Her portrayal of Saber is colder, deadlier, and far more focused than before, while Tomokazu Seki's performance as the King of Heroes (Archer/Gilgamesh), is more arrogant, more proud. That said, it's Ootsuka Akio in the role of the King of Conquerors (Rider/Iskander), who really steals the show, and his testosterone-fuelled proclamations and battle-born wisdom are one of the pillars that support the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to development, a large group of characters often means that some will undoubtedly fall by the wayside. Fate/Zero neatly sidesteps the entire issue of development because it's first and foremost a prequel of an existing story, but in addition to this the series has created a set of individuals who leave extremely strong impressions on the viewer, and much like Baccano!, there is a distinct lack of a true main character. Because of these factors the series can focus on showing how each of the combatants became what they are, and this plays a major part in one's enjoyment of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe emphasis on characterisation rather than development allows for a remarkable degree of definition, and although it's ultimately the personalities of each individual that captures the viewer's attention, standing at the top of them all is the King of Conquerors - Rider. His addition to the franchise has been nothing short of a revelation, and while die-hard fans will continue to worship the ground that Saber and Archer (not Gilgamesh, the other one), walk on, Rider's enjoyment of life, his exuberance and almost boyish eagerness for battle and glory, have captured the imaginations of many fans.\\n\\n\r\nIn many respects he, more than any other character, is the epitome of the heroes of old, but simply having a bunch of overzealous combat junkies beating each other to a pulp isn't really entertainment (unless you have an IQ equal to your shoe size), so there has to be something to balance it - and there is. Each of the mages taking part in the Holy Grail War is more like a chessmaster, planning as many moves ahead as possible, whilst preparing themselves for anything their opponents may try.\\n\\n\r\nThe simple fact is that Fate/Zero wouldn't work as either a story or entertainment if it was just the mages or the heroes, and it's this aspect of the series that separates it from not just its predecessors, but also many other action anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately it's not all sweetness and light.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main criticisms of this series is the episode about the young Tohsaka Rin, which many people found unnecessary. Now although there's some truth to that perception, one could also have the opinion that Rin's actions tie-in to an event in the previous episode, and together they lead up to the end of the series. Both are fair arguments, but in all honesty the whole thing doesn't really fit with the rest of the anime, and it seems like nothing more than an attempt to allow Matou Kariya some long overdue screen-time.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero isn't a perfect show, but while it does have several minor issues (and one \"filler\" episode), it does exactly what it sets out to do - capture the attention of the audience and make them want more. The story is intelligent, and while conversations and discussions can sometimes feel a little tedious, the dialogue is often quite interesting - moreso than the show's predecessor's anyway. Although the series can boast stylish, fast-aced action set-pieces, it also studiously avoids combat for the sake of gratuitous violence.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Fate/Zero is still a prequel series, and at this point only half of the story has been told. Unfortunately the anime industry has a habit of messing things up, but given the quality of this show, the fact that the original story was written by Urobuchi Gen, and the knowledge that the series is being produced by Type-Moon's long time collaborators - Ufotable, fans can be cautiously optimistic about the second installment.\\n\\n\r\nAll we can do is wait and see ...",

            "content": "Being the prequel of the well known franchise Fate/Stay Night, Fate/zero certainly captured the attention of many very easily. What is immediately clear about this production though is not only does it match its predecessor, it far surpasses it in every way imaginable. Whether it be the directing, visuals, character exposition, or anything you can possibly think of, Fate/zero manages to move into a class of its own. In the end, this all adds up to a much more complex and interesting tale, which one will certainly not be soon to forget.\r\nThe very base of Fate/Zero is no different from Fate/Stay Night. It revolves aroundsomething called the Holy Grail War, a war between 7 magus or masters (Magic users) who through the power of the grail summon heroic spirits who are people of legend, historical fame, or myth to do battle with each other to claim ownership of the grail which is said to be able to grant the owner any wish. But while the base of this story is pretty much the same as Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Zero is decidedly more dark, gritty, and violent. Any viewer who has taken care to watch the predecessor may initially be disoriented by tonal shifts in the universe, but if one is willing to move past this, there is undoubtedly a rewarding experience awaiting.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several things that Fate/Zero does impeccably well, but perhaps one of the most easily enjoyable aspects of the show is the chess like manner in which the war is carried out. The conflicts are enthralling in many ways, but what adds an extra layer of enjoyment to the show is how each move made by the characters is a well thought out, planned action. The masters constantly balance every decision with pros and cons and tries to maneuver through the war in the best manner possible. The war does not consist of mindless brawling and action and it is usually the best prepared individuals that benefit the most throughout the story. As a result, the action in this show is much more layered and hence captivating than that of your standard action show.\\n\\n\r\nOf course though, this show is about much more than seeing entertaining action, and cool magical powers. What the show really is at its heart is a very engrossing spiritual journey. The cast, particularly the masters and servants, are all engaged in a battle that defines their goals, wishes, and motivations in life. They all engage in a conflict for which their fate is solely in their own hands. Each character is forced to understand themselves and their foes as they continue on their quest. Indeed, Fate/Zero is very much so a character study, and a very captivating one at that. This is primarily owed to its excellent cast that surely will manage to intrigue just about anybody willing to look beyond the on the surface elements of the Fate universe.\\n\\n\r\nAn interesting note about the cast in Fate/Zero though is that it mostly consists of older men. This is particularly noteworthy because so few anime today dare to make a cast of older men. It showcases just how a story with older cast members, even if they are men, can be quite entertaining and that perhaps the same old tired formulas do not always need to be employed to reach certain audiences. A story does not always have to be about high school kids, and hopefully this show can set an example of that.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that most certainly not be forgotten though in this story is just how much it excels at the simple things. Of course as always, studio Ufotable provides excellent visuals (Though perhaps a bit stagnant at times in animation), the show has very solid direction, a very nice OST as displayed again by the talented Yuiji Kaijura, and excellent writing as expected of the now famed Urobuchi Gen. Perhaps most of all though is that Fate/Zero manages to capture the essence of its source material supremely well. This is made apparent by even the littlest of details such as the way they truly make the servants seem super human in their abilities compared to their masters or the way they frame the dialogues between the characters as they quibble over their philosophies, hopes and goals. Little touches like these just add so much more to the experience and really display how much care and effort are put into the production. This is something I felt was sorely missing in Fate/Stay Night, much to its detriment.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately Fate/Zero is a high class production. It is something that can be both thrilling, and intellectually satisfying at the same time. It displays a level of care and detail that anyone should be able to appreciate. But most of all, Fate/Zero is a quality piece of entertainment that one will certainly not be soon to forget.\\n\\n\\n\r\n****NOTE****\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is a prequel of Fate/Stay Night. Some of the differences between the two can be quite shocking since really, the Fate/Stay anime was an extremely poor adaption by Studio DEEN. For newcomers into the Fate universe I highly suggest if you can to instead play the Fate/Stay Night game in preparation for watching Fate/Zero if you are interested enough. It is an extremely enjoyable story, that I think is every bit as good as Fate/Zero and I think should really be experienced the way it was meant to be experienced. This means none of DEEN's budget cutting, anime original arc injections, poor scripting, etc. If there is one thing that was made extremely obvious during Fate/Zero it's that Ufotable gets Fate, and DEEN does not. The level of difference between the two studios in their renditions of the Fate universe  is truly incomparable as Ufotable's adaption leaves DEEN's adaption in the dust.",

            "content": "I\u2019m fairly confident this review is going to get near as damn 0% helpful marks simply because of my ratings. If anyone feels what I said wasn\u2019t helpful in this review, drop me a message, if you disagree with something I said, drop me a message, thanks. \r\nStory \u2013 3\r\nOh dear\u2026 \r\nFirstly,  I think it is a bit of a cheat essentially splitting fate zero into two separate series, so that all the good bits can be condensed into \u2018one\u2019 of those series. Nonetheless, I will still assess this as a single series, in terms of setting the stage for the second season.\r\nFate Zerohas a great set up. A survival game with some interesting aspects (such as the wish granting prize and the involvement of the church) as well as 7 moderately even teams (in terms of likeability and development). At its earliest points, it is unclear who is going to win this survival game, but, rather disappointingly, this quickly deteriorates into having a clear ultimate winner. This can still be equally as successful however, as long as this group has a stronger underlying connection with the story. Which is more or less covered in the second season.  \\n\\n\r\nFate Zero suffers with a great depravation of detail. Although I\u2019m sure the manga and novels cover this, it can\u2019t be an excuse to not cover anything at all. I am at a loss as to why the church is involved (was Jesus a hero?), why absolutely none of the world gives a single flying shit about entire cities getting threatened with destruction. The same is true with the history of the Holy Grail wars; did they have a single impact on anything we are currently watching? Do the writers have a single bloody clue about the heroes in Fate Zero? (I think not, ie, don\u2019t try and make yourself look clever by saying this is a historical figure, then change their name, characteristics, life story and even gender) Etc. This lack of detail also seems to be confusing the participants of the game, half of them don\u2019t know what is going on. Nor why they are even involved. Lazy.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, and this is what really grinded my gears, Fate zero (season one) has absolutely no balls. It is never willing to dramatically change the course of the survival game. All we ever see is a series of straight forward fight scenes with no conclusions and loads of conversations on who is the most noble champion. I accept that this is the first season, but with literally no progress and a very basic set up in terms of detail, it raises the question whether the first season was even needed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 7\\n\r\nIdeal for this genre. Entertaining and one dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nThere is an interesting relationship between the heroes and their respective masters. Each hero is their own individual with their own ambitions, which often conflict with their masters. Three command spells that demand absolute obedience are all the masters have to keep their servants in check. The relationship between the master and servant is crucial in this survival game and is well covered in this anime.  \\n\\n\r\nEvery character offers a different attitude on the battlefield and character interactions can be quite intense. This is well embodied by the fact that, in the most cases, the servant is nearly a complete opposite of their master. These conflicts make for some interesting interactions seeing that they have to work together to achieve the same goal. \\n\\n\r\nHaving such a large cast of characters, and having each character\u2019s attitudes exaggerated (for entertainment purposes) tends to strip the realism of the show. The clich\u00e9 characters in Fate Zero are largely responsible for the overall childish atmosphere (as well as the fight scenes themselves).  Which could well be what you are after, but this is something to keep in mind. \\n\\n\r\nArt and music- 9\\n\r\noutstanding\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation was phenomenal. The fight scenes were choreographed very well and they were truly a sight to behold. If only the scenery was something more stunning than a dockyard. The soundtrack, as you may know was composed by Yuki Kajiura (composer of Sword art online and mahou shoujo madoka magica for example). She has her own distinct style and if you liked any of her other works, I\u2019m sure you will also like this soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment \u2013 2\\n\r\nEergh\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nIf my personal disdain hasn\u2019t already been evident, here is my chance to make it clear. Firstly, I\u2019ve never been a fan of an action based anime. It always gets out of hand and fate zero isn\u2019t an exception. Unfortunately, Fate Zero doesn\u2019t have much else to offer besides the action. This thus limits how intelligent the anime can be. The best it can do is detail certain moves or powers of the heroes, and it tries to do this with the idea of a noble phantasm. This said power is essentially a secret and extremely powerful move that each hero has, that supposedly stems from their history. These end up having such vague connections and meanings and are all RIDICULOUSLY convenient to the situation. Poor effort.  Lastly, Fate zero needs to grow some balls. 13 episodes of literally no advancements in the survival game was so frustrating and it felt like a huge waste of time. The fights were nice though. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, Fate Zero 2nd Season advances almost immediately and thus is instantly more enjoyable. Just to be clear, this review isn\u2019t a response to an irrational hatred of the fate zero universe. Far from it, I liked the second season a great deal, and I can see that with the detail that the manga could possibly offer, it can be really great. But as it stands, Fate Zero the anime is a rather pointless and is not needed for the second season. \\n\\n\r\nAs this is such a highly rated anime, I would love to hear from those that do think this is amazing, because I need some convincing.  \\n",

Fate/Zero is one of them, and i believe it has the potential to be one of the best anime of the year.\r\nStory wise, it's been following the light novel consistently with great precision, picking up almost every single finest detail that are required to elaborate the story into a fine piece. The battle scenes are just simply amazing, you could never get enough of the fighting scenes, some of the episodes filled with action just make your blood boiled when you watch them. The way how theyassemble the servants together and the relationship in between the servants are also being depicted clearly. I have to say ufotable is doing a great job thus far, their ability to illustrate the art of fate series are second to none. Sound wise, the OP and the ED are just simply amazing. Watching the ED especially brings you into the story, making you wanting to know which era and where does every single servant comes from, and the story behind them in their respective era. \\n\\n\r\nI've watched up to 5 episodes thus far and i only have but one line to say - oh my god its so just damn amazing i almost jizzed my pants off.",

            "content": "Ufotable probably used the Holy Grail and granted the fan's wish.most of the fans turned their attention to fate/zero the moment they heard about the involvement of ufotable since they knew they could expect great things with other works they had seen from them.as we all know just having a good story won't make an anime good.how to adapt it and include the parts of the story,the good use of music and art and many other things are playing a big role in an anime.this anime didn't disappoint and tried hard to bring out the awesomeness.\r\nStarting with the story the anime made a good useof the rich materials it had and the story can be considered one of the great parts.the Events of the story and the dialogues are not cliche or random and most of them happens for a reason and should be taken seriously since fate/zero is not just about battles.Fate/zero happened 10 years before Fate/stay night and the wars of the Holy Grail are about to begin once again.(those that are familiar with the wars can skip this part.the grail first appeared when three great Magus family decided to share their knowledge with each other to summon the holy grail in order to achive the roots of all knowledges.but they realized that the grail can only grant one wish and since they originally had different wishes the wars for the holy grail got started.in each war some masters with the desire for the grail gets chosen and will be granted a servant and three command seals.these masters will have to fight with each other under the control of a judge to win the grail that can grant them their wish.the servants are heroic spirits from our past or future or our legends and the masters are mostly magus with great power or desire for the grail.\\n\r\nnow the 4th war is beginning and the Tohsaka family had a good history with the church and got help from them.the Einzbern family hired the famous Magus killer Kiritgusu Emiya and Zouken from the Matou family is using any mean possible to attend this war or getting prepared for the next one.there are other masters as well like Kayneth from the Archibald family or even masters without any famous magus family that got their chance to participate in this war by luck or their hidden desires.)\\n\r\neven though there are some unexplained things in the anime it is still very enjoyable because of the unexpected events and good character design .a good example of character design can be seen in the combination of Masters and Servants.you can almost be interested in all master and servant combinations.for example even if you find Velvet character uninteresting his servant will make up for it big time.as for a bad example i can name assassin since in my opinion the fate universe doesn't like this class.another good thing about it is the protagonist Kiritsugu Emiya which although has a cliche emo attitude he is still enjoyable more than Shirou Emiya in Fate/stay night Route at least but then again this is a matter of opinion.most of the characters are complicated and this makes them interesting and force the audience to think about them.although one things that may bother you is how they survive most of their battles several times even though their death flag is up but still it is enjoyable.one of the great things about F/z is that you can understand F/sn character's background which left unexplained in f/sn anime Specially Sakura and Kotomine.(which is a good thing for those that are not familiar with the VN or LN).speaking about Kotomine he is one of the best examples of character development and the audience can see how he became what he is with the temptations of Gilgamesh with his snake-like eyes at the end of episode 12(tokiomi used the first skin of snake that got shed to summon him ironically)\\n\\n\r\nthe art looks very good at first glance considering this is a TV-series anime since it reminded me of another work of Ufotable named Garden of Sinners which was an OVA(and another work by TypeMoon).while the enviroment is dark the battles are flashy and when the art is weird you should expect something big since they are saving the budget for the real deal like the 10th episode with Alexander's Noble Phantasm.they also did the Berserker design in CGI which was weird at first but it fits him and makes him special.the art is clean,shiny and devilishly mysterious that fits the story well. \\n\\n\r\nthe Soundtracks may not get your attention until the very end of episode 1 when the summoning begins.and after that there is the next episode OP(counts as the first episode ED)which i think Lisa did a great job.after that there is the real ED from Aoi Air named Memoria that can be seen in the next episode which also gives us a little peak to the servant's legends which is cool.after all of these the battles finally got started and here in my opinion they did a great job on each character's theme specially Berserker which you can here the enchant of Berserker in it like the Sephiroth soundtrack(One-Winged Angel)in FFVII Series.as for voice acting they used some real talented people and most of the people from the VN or f/sn anime got their roles back.they have the sweet voice of Sayaka Ohara for Irisviel(although i think she could do better),and for the protagonist we have the voice of Rikiya Koyama which is the best choice for these kind of characters.for Zouken they got Masane Tsukayama and he did a great job in Kaiji as Hyoudou and both characters resemble each other(and most of the people can recognize him since the second season of Kaiji aired recently).although there are characters that are not talking yet like berserker since he will only make noises for this season but the awesome soundtrack makes up for it.overall they did a good job in this part and used an epic-dark theme in their songs that fits the fate universe.\\n\\n\r\nI tried and recommended the show to some of my friends.some liked it for its historical references or the art and some for its story even though some of em didn't even like animes before.this cannot be considered for everyone and i can't say that this show is for every kind of taste but since it didn't just count on one aspect like story,while it can have its own flaws it can satisfy a vast range of audiences.\\n\r\ncombination of a good story and character design,good soundtracks and good art makes this one of the good animes of 2011 that is recommended for those that needs some adrenaline rush.",

            "content": "I wrote a review for Fate/Zero before but it got deleted because it only talked about the fight scenes. So I'm including the story in this review as well. Enjoy. \r\nWarning: spoilers. \r\nThe story can be summed up in two words: Forced Grimdark. Characters suffer and die for no apparent reason other than to make the show darker and edgier. [spoiler]Why was Kariya even in there? Most of these characters don't even become relevant until FSN. That Rin episode was fucking awful, it had no relevance to the plot whatsoever. As was the Kiritsugu backstory which I thought was two long episodes of nothing butforced drama. Kiritsugu keeps being put into implausible situations where he has to kill his own parents. He killed father because \"he might accidentally turn everyone into zombies\". Natalia forgets to bring a parachute on a mission where she's on a plane containing wasps that turn people into zombies because MUH FEELS. Kiritsugu could have put Avalon into Maiya healing her wounds instantly instead of letting her die, but didn't, because MUH FEELS. Lancer died like a bitch because MUH FEELS. Totally didn't steal \"lancer kill yourself\" from the original FSN. Kariya strangles Aoi even though we're told earlier on that he loves her because MUH FEELS. Why are there so many irrelevant characters and why do they all have to die in the most pathetic way possible? Example: Iskander. Big hearted and funny guy right? Better kill him off in the most retarded way possible to increase MUH FEELS. And yes, it is retarded because Iskander had absolutely no reason to gallop 5 miles away from Gilgamesh when he could have put Gilgamesh slap bang into the middle of Ionian Hetairoi giving him no chance to pull out Ea. It's funny because the historical Alexander the Great was a shrewd and cunning general, the polar opposite of the F/Z Iskander. Was the serial killer couple put in there for any reason other than to make the anime darker and edgier? This is what I call forced grimdark - having characters suffer and kill each other for no reason other than to make the viewer sad. [/spoiler]\\n\\n\r\nFight scenes are badly directed. I could pick out so many things wrong with Fate/Zero fights. In all Lancer vs Saber fights, all they do is talk talk talk and compliment each other on their skills. They're not even trying to kill each other. The Kariya vs Tohsaka fight was fucking dumb. It was just Kariya throwing wasps at Tohsaka. \"Huh, wasps all getting burned to crisp? Throw more wasps!\". The Berserker vs Gilgamesh \"fight\" was just Gilgamesh is throwing weapons at Berserker. The \"dogfight\" was just Berserker going pew pew at Archer. All of Berserker scenes are painful to watch because of the terrible CG. The Kiritsugu vs Kirei battle was fucking dumb. Why was it set in the fucking batcave? There's no lead-up whatsoever. The entire fight consisted of Kirei punching Kiritsugu in the chest, Kiritsugu shooting Kirei in the hand, and then the retarded knife blocking scene. Kiritsugu managed to get hit with the most telegraphed punch to the chest in the history of the universe. He had like 10 minutes to react. A 1 year old could have dodged it. I don't understand why they wasted the animation budget on slow-motioning this scene with single framing when it was just Kiritsugu getting punched in the chest, whilst really fast scenes like Kirei throwing his black keys only got double framed, which made it difficult to see what happened. He didn't even try to dodge or block it, he was just standing there not doing anything. Fucking dumb. The next scene was even dumber. Kirei getting shot in the hand was just stupid. Not to mention the massive anticlimax with the black mud crashing through the batcave ceiling JUST AS Kirei and Kiritsugu are about to kill each other. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe most annoying thing about the fight scenes is that the movements look wooden and robotic. Characters standing still just moving their arms. There is distinct lack of whole body movement. You can see in the Kirei vs Kiritsugu fight that all Kirei does is move his arm when blocking Kiritsugu's attacks. The rest of his body is completely still, not showing any changes at all, not even redrawn for like 20 frames. This is just laziness. \\n\\n\r\nI might mention again the level of disjointedness in the fight scenes. I've said before that the Saber vs Berserker fight scenes were completely disjointed, as in consecutive scenes did not even match each other. If you look at any of the fight scenes closely you'll see that disjointedness permeates from the highest to the lowest level. The Maiya vs Kirei fight scene was disjointed in that one scene shows Maiya's knife hand being deflected by Kirei's right hand, and the next frame shows Kirei's left hand grabbing Maiya's wrist, with no intermediate scene that shows how we got from here to there. The scenes don't match each other at all. The animation is not smooth, as in one second it speeds up and another second it slows down again randomly. This is a prime example of bad directing. \\n\\n\r\nSummary: All of the Fate Zero fight scenes were underwhelming due to the stiff, awkward and wooden movements and disjointed action sequences.",

            "content": "The main flaws with this anime are that it's dialogue heavy and the fights are ultimately pointless.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe \"Holy Grail War\" is a battle royale with 7 sets of Masters/Servants partnering together to take out the other 6, winner gets the Holy Grail, which grants a miracle. Masters can use magic or guns to fight, or are completely useless in battle, some staying far away from the action. The servants all have a fighting style unique to their \"class\", Lancer uses spears, Saber uses a sword, Assassin is an assassin...you get the point. A few more people are thrown in to the war to makethings more interesting. Sounds good right? Of course it does.\\n\\n\r\nI love me some good planned out fights with logical strategies, thinking about the end game. Unfortunately, that is only the way a few of the masters think. The rest of the cast either does no planning at all or has a plan but then gets pissed and lashes out in anger. With nearly every fight ending anticlimactically with one character (often an enemy) jumping in and saving another at the last second, or retreating after a defeat, the plot has barely moved at all in 13 episodes. Episode 10 served almost no purpose, as it revolves around a daughter of a master, Rin, a side character, with only a couple minor plot points.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nIn the beginning the animation was some of the worst I've seen in the past decade, but after it gets its head on straight it does a fine job. Fight scenes are well animated. Facial expressions are pretty hit or miss. Backgrounds are well done. The fog/lighting also stood out. Be aware that they use CG to animate Berserker.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe Opening song is decent, the ending song is nothing special. Background music goes for a minimalist approach and succeeds, nothing special about it, nothing bad, it sets the tone for the most part. Voice acting and sound effects are average/slightly above average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nWith over a dozen \"main\" characters, it's hard to make them all unique and memorable. About a third of the characters are, a third are generic and can quite accurately be described in one word, and the other third have basically the same personality. \\n\\n\r\nBerserker gets so little screen time it's criminal. Assassin was downright disappointing. Rider easily has the most appealing personality out of the servants. Caster and his master are serial killing psychopaths who would rather kill random people then participate in the war. Very few characters have any development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nThe main reason I couldn't fully enjoy this anime is that almost all the characters are still around, with only 1, maybe 2 of the characters dying or otherwise no longer being able to participate in the war. With characters saving enemies from certain demise for no reason other than honor, when they are trying to eliminate each other, it leads me to the conclusion that honor is just another way to say ass-pull.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime? Yes. Do you absolutely have to watch it? No. \\n\\n\r\nIf you can get past the long conversations and anticlimactic fights, give it a shot. It is an above average anime.",

            "content": "This show is unsalvageable. Its openly one of the many horrible overrated shows I've watched. I have never been so unbelievably bored over a greek god death tournament anime. Yes that is the premise yet it is tedious nonsense with a weak script, terrible characters, & piss poor animation. \r\nWant to know what you'll experience? Exposition. This show is 97 percent exposition. Characters are worthless, bleak, pathetic, & annoying. They serve the plot and have no personalities.The show has a great premise: greek gods death tournament to win a godly prize. However it is TERRIBLE IN EXECUTION. Every character is rushed things are forced. Forexample: A married couple of eight years in the first episode do heavy exposition for the story. The husband says something like, \"I must kill you\" and she goes \"Lol its cool\". The scene doesn't make sense. Nobody talks like this especially a married couple with a child. \\n\\n\r\nThe females in this show are extremely unlikable and irritating. They have a \"badass\" female as the lead yet in every fight she is saved by males at the last minute. Meanwhile, the other females are cheerleaders who exist to suck off the men. They have nothing going for them other than that.\\n\\n\r\nNothing HAPPENS. I'm serious the fights have no consequences as everyone just walks away. They make threats that the next fight will be the end. However, the end never comes. Characters in a \"death tournament\" make all the excuses in the world to avoid killing each other! Its excuses like, 'you're wounded so I cant', 'you're up against two its not fair', 'I want to see you suffer'. GET BLOODY ON WITH IT. This is a death tournament! What is with all the excuses that are used in 90 percent of the show. At one point a character is about to shoot another one across a building but stops do to him being forced to withdraw by another character. WHY DID HE STOP? The guy in question was about to order his greek god to kill his wife! This show is laughable in how stupid & horribly written it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe show rails on and on with exposition but I could hardly make out what the hell was happening. So much useless dull info dumping that went nowhere. Every outcome became predictable & trite. The fans say this is fun & exciting? This is top tier overhyped misery porn. And its not even good misery porn. \\n\\n\r\nThe fights are animated horribly. You get one hit then narration. Another hit then narration. It seriously looks like a cheap video game in how its designed. Its no surprise this is based off a hentai game. This is worthless violence for uninspired annoying bleak characters. \\n\\n\r\nI have never loathed a show this much its near laughable for how mad it drove me. Gantz is a violent death alien tournament anime with slow pacing, cringe writing, & mean spirited characters and it is ONE THOUSAND PERCENT more interesting & fun than this. Watch that instead. \\n\\n\r\nStay away from this it is not worth your time nor sanity \\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nTRASH",

Maybe because every character falls into a generic archetype, such as, Irisvile (weak defenseless female), Saber ( strong female), and a boring protagonist who hardly ever shows up, and is apparently cheating on his wife. Now getting to the story, for the most part, it consists of Irisvile clinging to Saber's underwear while acting as a defenseless female who has no where better to be but involved in this Grail War which the shows speaks of alot. The pacing is absolutely horrendous, constantly wasting episodes upon episodes on fights that don't result in a servant getting defeated; basically, people just show up and leave, not progressing the story at all in any way or form. However, despite all these negatives, the only positive aspect is the graphics/ art, they are incredible, but this does not excuse a show of as poor quality as Fate/ Zero.",

A journey of epic proportions in a well-grounded mythological world based on reality, a masterpiece\u201d\r\nREVIEW FREE OF SPOILERS!\r\nAs I have stated before in my reviews I\u2019ve been watching anime shows for a short period of time -3 years-. And as I\u2019ve said before, thanks to the help/aid of some of my friends, I\u2019ve had one of the best beginnings/introductions to the anime world, and here\u2019s where \u201cFATE/\u2026\u201d comes in, more specifically FATE/STAY NIGHT. [I know this is a \u201cFATE/ ZERO\u201d review]\r\nFATE/S. N. Was the third anime that I watched. I\u2019ve been a fan of magic stories since I can remember,and when you connect: Magic, the modern world and a \u201cdark\u201d \u201cmysterious\u201d mood in the story you have my whole attention \u2013as long as the story is interesting of course-.\\n\\n\r\nSo naturally after watching \u2013and loving it- FATE/S.N.  I heard that the prequel of FATE/ S.N. was going to be broadcast, so obviously, I was ecstatic.\\n\r\nBack in the day I didn\u2019t really knew about the previous story of \u201cFATE/\u2026\u201d except for the things that where told on STAY NIGHT. So I knew  was going to be on an amazing journey on this new chapters/episodes.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s begin\u2026! :D\\n\\n\r\n-STORY: 10-\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly it\u2019s a masterpiece. From the first seconds of the first episode, I could see that the story/idea had matured, it wasn\u2019t a show focused \u2013mainly- for a younger audience, now it was darker, more mature story. It revealed more, the preparations that the main characters/fighters had. Comparing S.N. with ZERO, ZERO immerses you -from the start- in the lives of those who were about to compete for the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d, revealing not just characters and situations but the mythology behind it all, AND the magic in it, giving it \u2013the show- a well-grounded myth and not just a plain story that will unfold in the next episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in the occult, or the mysteries, or simply if you like well-founded or good \u201depic\u201d stories this IS the anime for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-ART: 10- \\n\r\nColorful. Probably the first thing that catches everyone\u2019s eyes from F/Zero is the Art. The animation IS flawless, perfect, an \u201ceye-candy\u201d to call it somehow. The surrounding ambient is perfectly detailed and believable and the characters are mesmerizing to the point in which you ask yourself what will come on the near future.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in art design, by all means this is for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-SOUND: 10-\\n\r\nPersonally I\u2019m a guy that places the \u201csound/music\u201d of a show as one of the most important things of all. And I must say the ambient sounds and music of this show are hypnotizing. Leaving aside the \u201cambient\u201d sound which are breathtaking and perfect I will \u201ctalk\u201d mainly of the music behind the anime.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack/score of this anime was composed by Yuki Kajiura (Sword Art Online I & II, Pandora Hearts and Noir)\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura\u2019s work in this anime is as usual \u2013for her- a work beyond words. To put it bluntly the first song of the score \u201cFate to Zero\u201d resumes her work perfectly. Its dark, it\u2019s sad, it makes your skin crawl reaching deep in your bones, it\u2019s a soundtrack filled with emotions, and it\u2019s a work of epic proportions, a journey into the dark world of \u201cFATE\u201d. A very memorable soundtrack. \\n\r\nA-MUST-HEAR-SOUNDTRACK.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like/love or you\u2019re just interested in not great but amazing music arrangements, this is the show for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER: 10-\\n\r\nFATE/ZERO shines for its uniqueness and most importantly for the uniqueness of its characters. This is one of those shows that have a very high amount of MC\u2019s. Usually I avoid this kind of shows/movies for they fail amazingly in one important aspect: the focus, and this \u2013the focus- is one of the most remarkable things in this anime, each character or correctly put each \u201cgroup\u201d of characters is given a very important place/moment. Each one has their own goal and believes which makes each and every one of these characters believable and most importantly, you can get \u201cclose\u201d to them.\\n\\n\r\nAnother incredible aspect of the characters within \u201cFATE/ ZERO\u201d is the \u201ccharacter development\u201d department in which many shows fail \u2013which is not the case of FATE- Each character changes, matures during the whole season/show. Some change ideologies, some find a new way to fulfill their beliefs, revealing things of themselves to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in character development THIS IS your show. \\n\\n\\n\r\n-ENJOYMENT & OVERALL: 10-\\n\r\nFATE/ ZERO is one of those shows that leaves you wanting more, and not because they fail to answer things, it leaves you wanting more because of the superb way the show is made.\\n\\n\r\nAnother masterpiece in my books.\\n",

            "content": "I'm sorry, but this anime is simply atrocious.\r\nI honestly don't understand the appeal of Fate/Zero at all. It's been praised by so many and it has a really high rating, however, I just can't stomach it. Mind you, there are some minor spoilers of first four episodes just to be able to shed light on why I rated the show so low without being automatically reported. Not that it won't happen regardless.\r\nFirst episode has to be the most boring, pointless episode I ever watched. Absolutely no effort was made to spark the interest of the viewer or to summarize the story properly. It threw atyou an enormous amount of information about many miscellaneous things in an incredibly monotonous voice and without any proper order. Throughout the entire episode there was nothing that kept me engaged whatsoever. As if I'm supposed to be intrigued and eagerly listen to ominous, rambling, mumbling old men in robes telling us something of great importance is coming.\\n\\n\r\nSecond episode had some seriously annoying and edgy characters introduced. Waver Velvet - incredibly annoying character who all he does is whine in a super annoying voice. Waver Velvet's familiar or whatever it's called, the summoned guy, the 'i'm the strongest'. *googles* Rider, right. Awful character. And he has over 5000 favorites?\\n\r\nThen we got the edgy scene where they brutally kill a kid with apparently some straight out of hentai tentacles to appear to be dark and serious. Then I realized, this show must have been made for fourteen year olds, and reading through the comments nothing was more obvious than that. \"This got so dark!\" or \"Giglamesh is so cool!\" were some of the comments I encountered.\\n\r\nAh, yes, you dear naive teen, just wait five years when you realize how bad one-dimensional characters Ryuunosuke Uryuu (literally read his description) and Caster (I'm evil cuz I'm evil! Fear me!) are.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point I was already exhausted from nauseating boredom and cringing from awfully designed characters, but I decided not to give up yet, because I believed there had to be something interesting about the show. The fight scenes must be beyond interesting, should be absolutely ecstatic, I'm sure, because that's the reason so many people praise the series. I was deeply disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn't even remember the third episode even though I just watched it so I went to skip through it again just to remind myself what was happening in it. Ah, yes, we were following the life of aforementioned Waver and Rider, more old men in robes mumbling and towards end apparently some affair got revealed, at which point I couldn't care less about. I watched it three times and haven't remembered a thing, that's how much of an intriguing episode it was.\\n\\n\r\nFinal episode I watched before deciding to throw this back into abyss, was FINALLY some actual action. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, and dear slaughtered children. Something was actually happening in this episode, besides idle chat or boring monotonous speeches. Unfortunately, sixty seconds in I realized I'm not going to have fun watching it nor I am planning on continuing the anime past this point. The first fight was turned into a series of inner and outer monologues and made my immersion completely impossible and I couldn't keep bearing it.\\n\\n\r\nI tried to like this anime, I tried watching it three times, but I cease here. This anime is simply not for me. If I were to summarize it in one word, I'd have to use the word 'childish'.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero is a show as confident in its storytelling as it is confused in its aims. After many tries, I've filed it away still unable to describe what point Urobuchi is trying to make with this. The closest I've come is that it's a condemnation of idealism, but this is only weakly supported by the text, and I suspect that impression is more a function of it being a prequel to a visual novel that thoroughly affirms the great moral significance of ideals. In that light, Fate/Zero's grim, cynical ending merely serves a narrative purpose. This doesn't make it unwatchable or even bad, but itdoes make it a fairly predictable addition to the Fate continuity\u2014if you've read Fate/stay night, this will be exactly what you expect it to be and not much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nStill, that isn't to say that Fate/Zero is boring. The art and animation are sharp and precise, Urobuchi's excellent storytelling makes Fate/Zero as thrilling as anything Code Geass has to offer. The characters, themes, and mood of Fate/stay night are flawlessly transferred to this show; Kotomine remains among the best antagonists I've ever seen in a genre show, and Kiritsugu's backstory does him justice, bringing to life that strange, cold silhouette hanging over Shirou's every action in the VN. Urobuchi's Saber is somewhat one-dimensional\u2014though there are certainly less attractive sides to the character than the whole honorable knight routine\u2014but then it isn't really her story. It's also tough to complain when she receives such a heartbreaking character moment at the end of the show, dragging her down to the nadir she needs to be mired in to set up her for Fate/stay night. Without giving away too much, it's a deeply affecting portrayal of Saber's lowest ebb, anticipating the sequel in which she is finally rewarded for her martyrdom, for all the years that she shouldered the shame and sin of her people in the name of justice and honor. Nonetheless, you'd be forgiven for thinking that she's little more than a gender-swapped Lancer after watching this.\\n\\n\r\nI suspect the problem with Fate/Zero is that Urobuchi does not write characters in the same way that Nasu does and there's an odd disconnect there. This wasn't an issue in Madoka because it was purely an Urobuchi creation, but it hurts Fate/Zero simply because Fate/stay night, for all its many faults, had some extremely distinctive character writing. Whenever Kotomine or Kiritsugu are onscreen, this show comes to life. Kotomine is a devilish twist on the fairly played-out some-men-just-want-to-watch-the-world-burn Joker-type villain in that he's wracked with confusion and contradiction\u2014a man who became a priest just to avoid confronting his darkest impulses. Watching him come to terms with himself over the course of Fate/Zero is absolutely thrilling. Some of his dialogue with Gilgamesh might be a little on-the-nose, but the tendency to tell rather than show is a trait Urobuchi shares with Nasu, and it doesn't detract from the intrigue. Unfortunately, the new characters, as well as those without any backstory established for them in Fate/stay night, are all exceptionally dull and predictable by comparison. Kariya is a character with plenty of potential that was entirely squandered; the same goes for Tokiomi and Aoi, whose stories only affected me because of my familiarity with Rin and Sakura and the legacy left for them. Kayneth and Sola-Ui are indescribably bland villains\u2014so bland that Urobuchi apparently didn't even bother to resolve their storyline with Lancer. \\n\\n\r\nI'm darting around the main point here, though; these plot devices masquerading as characters are nothing compared to this show's attempt to introduce a pair of legitimately developed characters in Rider and Waver. These two are almost entirely superfluous besides their involvement in plot development\u2014especially Waver\u2014and are by turns irritating, predictable, or both. Urobuchi is not a very funny writer, and though there's nothing on the level of Madoka's \"girls shouldn't like girls\" gag, Rider and Waver's painful attempts at lightening the mood in the early episodes of the show come off as dull and obvious. The show starts taking them more seriously later on, but this doesn't improve things, as I'm fairly sure that they have the same conversation about twenty times\u2014Waver's inferiority complex acts up, Rider makes some gruff, paternal gesture to stop his navel-gazing and cheer him up, and they ride off on their chariot. The principal problem is that Waver's arc is damnably obvious. The first time you see him, you just know that he's going to end up finding the respect he wants by entering the Grail War and stepping up to the challenges it presents. That's exactly what happens, and though that might be forgivable if that story was told in a way that you don't expect, it just isn't. The ponderous tone of the Fate universe means that we spend a painstakingly long time listening to these two repeat themselves, so if you hadn't figured out where Waver's character was headed after the first few scenes with him and Rider, don't worry\u2014you'll get a hundred more opportunities to witness this shallow development again and again. Waver's story has no particular thematic congruence with the rest of Fate, nor a deep connection with the other characters. At this stage, he's just some kid, and the focus on him dilutes Fate/Zero far too much.\\n\\n\r\nRider is significantly better, though he still comes off as a little superfluous thanks to his interactions with Waver, and never really ascends beyond the level of archetype despite some interesting backstory. He's an obvious foil to Saber, a Nietzschean font of vitality living selflessly by living selfishly, indulging in his passions and laughing all the way to Valhalla. In other words, he's Gilgamesh, Saber's preexisting foil, without the potent streak of nihilism that made Gilgamesh that much more unpredictable. Rider justifies his behaviour through a belief in master morality and rational self-interest; Gilgamesh doesn't even think such things are worth justifying, and that's what makes him the more interesting character. To give Rider his due, the idea of a journey to seek out an impossible ideal\u2014his principal motivation\u2014has some thematic weight in the broader context of the Fate universe, but there's no real point to him as he relates to the other characters. There is one thing that he contributes to the dialogue: his beliefs mean that he can challenge Saber on her principles, while Gilgamesh is devoid of principles in the first place. It would simply be out-of-character for Gilgamesh to question Saber. Gilgamesh sees the tragic beauty of Saber's condition without necessarily endorsing or dismissing it\u2014he merely beholds it as it is, caring only if it serves his own interests. Still, with the emergence of plot developments at the end of Fate/Zero that throw Saber into despair and self-doubt, it's questionable whether Rider even needed to challenge her, especially when she already has Kiritsugu's cold utilitarianism to contend with. The overarching problem remains that the dialogue about idealism was already set up by Fate/stay night and Fate/Zero largely just mimics it. The addition of Rider to that dialogue seems like an afterthought.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the matter of Caster and Ryuunosuke, who are either deployed to meet Fate/Zero's edgy grimdark quota or played for laughs; it might not surprise you that I didn't partake in any. That said, they are far more interesting antagonists than Kayneth and his phoned-in villainous arrogance, and I appreciated Caster mistaking Saber for Joan of Arc\u2014quite a clever and appropriate little touch\u2014but in many scenes, they're merely buffoonish and pad out the show even further. In a universe so concerned with little details and thematic cohesion, characters ought not to be playing such shallow roles.\\n\\n\r\nThe best episodes of Fate/Zero are the ones that cut out the fluff; Kiritsugu's backstory, told over the course of two episodes, is particularly good\u2014revealing any of it would spoil it, even if you've read Fate/stay night. It's baffling that Urobuchi is so very good when he's dealing with someone else's characters, but is incapable of introducing any new character here whose purpose and relevance I can fully describe beyond their role in the plot\u2014Rider is the lone exception, and even with him, it's pretty shaky. There is, however, one episode of Fate/Zero that is definitely superfluous, and yet I can't help but enjoy it. That episode is Rin's Adventure, a sweet little diversion around midway through the show that focuses on one of Fate/stay night's best characters, Tohsaka Rin. In Fate/Zero, she's still an elementary schooler, and it's a real treat to see here the beginnings of the sharp-tongued, reluctant heroine she would become.\\n\\n\r\nIdeally, one would read Fate/stay night before watching this, but for those unwilling to slog through a visual novel, this is better directed and more accessible than Studio DEEN's Fate/stay night. It's good rather than great, but it's entertaining above all. If you like tight plotting, high production values, and men talking in dark, earnest tones, this is worth a watch.",

            "content": "I have been waiting for this for so long, my wish finally granted by the Golden studios ufotable! It\u2019s not every day that a Type-Moon fangirl like me (who has to yearn for VN & light novel translations to keep her company) gets such a treat. After finally getting a closure on Kara no Kyoukai after reading the light novels, Carnival Phantasm and Fate/Zero were the beacons I wanted to grasp. I say, forget the Fate/stay night anime right now, srsly right now! DEEN simply raped it badly and the VN\u2019s epicness was never captured but if you\u2019ve seen it, at least it gives youenough information about the characters that you are seeing in a new light in this two-cour series. \\n\\n\r\nThis comes from a God studio ufotable, who had done such a brilliant job on Kara no Kyoukai. If you've read the novels and seen the movies, you already know they really worked on being faithful to the original material. In this case Urobuchi's words and nasuverse character come alive on screen and complimented by not only production quality but hours and hours of work done on it. Even if you have not seen Fate/stay night or played the VNs, don't fret, this is a brilliant series to get into nasuverse and Type-Moon goodness. Being an expert, I guarantee you that you'll never regret it. \\n\\n\r\nI'm writing this review just after episode one but seriously THIS is what you call an awesome start or as Chaos Neco Arc would say, Hajimari, yo~ The around 48minute run of this episode was ideal for introducing all the Holy Grail jargon along with the first take on all the masters. Sure, not everyone was given the limelight as Caster\u2019s master Ryuunosuke is still MIA but that would come in the next episode for sure. The finished product in terms of first episode was nothing short of brilliant. It\u2019s not every day that you see HD quality animation on a series. In movies, sure! But in a two-cour series like this; is definitely one of the firsts. It\u2019s a treat for the sore eyes and looks brilliant even on low quality stream. BGM by Yuki Kajiura is spine tingling sometimes and I recommend to use quality headphones for this one because while the scenes play; from the sound of wind blowing to even flicker of candles, dialogue quality and BGM placement all enhances the viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character is voiced perfectly and from being an arrogant bastards to cute lolis, this has everything that you might be looking forward to. Also, there are so many badass men! Sure, Saber rocks and including her delivery of \u201cAnata ga watashi o Master ka?\u201d but man! Kiritsugu and Kirei are something else; especially Kiritsugu and his guns and his smoke. Yep, lots of gun and smoke porn on this one\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, from the looks of things and the summoned servants, this series is going to be full of schemes, conspiracies and back stabbing with the right dash of drama and romance. Kirei and Kirutsugu are going to play very strong roles in shaping up the plot and even if they are opposites in terms of values, they share more similarities than any other master. So, keep watching this for awesome development and even bet calls on who dies first because after all, this will be a cutthroat deluxe with winner taking all the glory and supremacy. \\n\\n\r\nSo, quickly:\\n\r\nStory - scheming, conspiracies, war and spine-tingling action. What more can a watcher ask for?\\n\r\nArt - Simply beautiful, just look at those detailed backgrounds!\\n\r\nSound - Yuki Kajiura, do I have to say anything else?\\n\r\nCharacters - Many and far between, yet you will end up remembering everyone and even side with some to their twisted motives to glory.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Brilliant. I want my fill of mystery and action, shaken and stirred.\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10 and this might actually increase while the series continues. I'm blogging this series on Metanorn so you can drop by to fangirl/boy anytime.",

            "content": "In almost all forms of media, spinoffs, sequels, and prequels all have one thing in common. They are a crap shoot. Most of the time these spinoffs suck. Fortunately in anime, that is not always the case. In fact there are several times where I find myself enjoy the sequel/ prequel better than the original. However this anime is true rarity, in which the prequel just about outdoes the original in virtually every aspect. This review focuses solely on the first season of fate/zero. I'll write a separate review for season 2. \r\n___________________________________________\r\nO.K. here is the actual review with my IADb rating system:\r\nStory:  FateZero takes place ten years before the events of Fate/stay night, and Chronicles the 4th Holy Grail War. The whole grail war consists of seven teams, with each team consisting of a master and a servant. These servants are heroic spirits that fight each other to the death, with the last servant standing winning the power for him and his master to make any type of wish on the holy grail. After failing to win the grail three times in a row, The Einzbern family have elected to bring the hated magus murderer, Kiritsugu Emiya (who is also the father of the main protagonist in Fate/ Stay Night), into their ranks and compete for the grail. When Emiya ultimately summons Saber as his servant, the two form one of the most unique relationships that I have ever seen. One of the primary things you watched fate/ stay night for was the battles, and while the battles are great here, it is the unforgettable dialogue that drives the anime home.\\n\\n\r\nThe Battles: While the dialogue is amazing, fate zero is part of the fate franchise, and hence the battles are a must see. What makes these fights so interesting though is the dialogue that goes on in them.  Unlike fate/ stay night, where to many extents you were presented with a typical shounen fight, you get so much more here. You really do learn the back story of every combat tent and are forced to pick sides. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: There are over 7000 animes on this website. I have seen almost 500 of them and will be reviewing all of them this year. Out of those 500 animes, the cast in this anime ranks 4th, with the only 3 having a better cast being Steins Gate, rainbow nisha rokubou no shichinin, and full metal alchemist brotherhood.  Virtually every master and every servant here plays its part perfectly. You have rider, the fan favorite who is just epic. (yes i just said \"epic\"). You have caster, the child murdering servant who couldn't give two sh*ts about the grail war. Than there is saber, one of the greatest female characters of all time. Archer is a great villain, but slightly over powered. Lancer proved himself to be a formidable opponent for Saber.\\n\\n\r\nArt: When i review the 2nd season this section will pretty much be a carbon copy. Fate/ Zero quite simply has the best animation that I have ever scene. It is just mind blowing how beautiful and life like everything looks. Ufotable knows how to produce a beautiful anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: All of the voice actors sound their age. All of the background music is perfectly used. The opening is great and the ending is one of the best in anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While the first episode is a complete info dump, and while there is technically no climax to this season as the finale is a regular episode that ends with \"to be continued in April,\" every other episode in this series left me baffled with amazement. Yes there are some flaws, and yes I can safely say that in the three month span between season1 and season 2, those flaws are seemingly eliminated, Fate/ Zero Season one is definitely an anime to watch.\\n\r\n____________________________________________\\n\r\nThe IADb official scoring:\\n\\n\r\nPlot, Sequence, Flow: 2.6/3 Points\\n\r\nOverall Characters: 1.6/2 Points\\n\r\nVisual Effects: 2/2 Points\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 0.8/1 Point\\n\r\nEnjoyment/ Lust to watch the next episode: 1.6/2 Point\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________________________\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 8.6\\n\r\nNY Grade: B+\\n",

            "content": "I am one of the many who walked into Fate/Zero with no prior knowledge of the Fate franchise, so when I watched the super long exposition/info dump that was this show's first episode a couple years ago, I was skeptical of whether or not I should have continued. I'm very, very glad that I chose to continue. \r\nFate/Zero is the prequel to Fate/Stay Night, written by Gen Urobuchi who is well known for his use of dark and mature atmosphere in his writing. This darkness and maturity is in full swing in Fate/Zero. This series is chock-full of plot twists, engaging dialogues, moral ambiguity, andmany other elements of a serious story. The recurring themes of morality, honor and chivalry on the battlefield, along with the constant clashing of ideologies between the show's fairly large cast make for a story with a lot of depth and drive. \\n\\n\r\nIt isn't perfect, though. No story is, unfortunately. I felt that the plot dragged on or felt slow at times. There were dialogues that I think, while engaging, had gone on too long, but this isn't a huge problem when you look at the big picture. Lots of people say that the ending was anticlimactic, and they're kind of right, but I think these people forget that Fate/Zero is a prequel. No matter how much you may want a grand and epic finale to a grand and epic show, if that show is only the precursor to another show, it's got to find a way to set up for what comes up next.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are arguably both the best and worst things in the show. \\n\\n\r\nI don't think I have ever come by a show where every single character receives proper attention and has depth. Does this show accomplish that? No, but I think it puts in a good effort. All fourteen of the main characters are unique, and each come with their own ideologies, motivations, and reasons for participating in the Holy Grail War. The viewer, rather than being treated to the usual good versus evil setup where a hero fights a villain in order to save the world like we've seen a million times before, gets a glimpse at each of the characters' motivations and their ideological outlooks. The characters all have a place on the good-evil scale, but none are truly righteous, and none are truly malevolent. This bit of moral ambiguity serves to make the characters a lot more realistic and less like fairy tale heroes--which ironically a lot of the characters happen to be.\\n\\n\r\nThis show isn't afraid to kill off its characters. There is no such thing as plot armor in Fate/Zero, and this is perhaps because Fate/Zero is devoid of any one true \"main\" character, at least not until the end. That's kind of the beauty of this series, though. You can have a perfectly created character with motivations, ethics, a good backstory, and all that other good stuff a character needs, but Fate/Zero doesn't give a hoot about that. If it means the plot will progress, then that character will die. If you're used to shows where characters are saved by writers pulling deus ex machina events out of their asses with contrived reasons like \"the power of friendship\" or \"the power of love,\" then Fate/Zero isn't the story for you.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the criticisms. I love the cast of Fate/Zero. I love the uniqueness and maturity of the characters. It's great, really. My gripe with the characters is that we can see quite obviously that they have depth, but we don't get to delve into said depths with the exception of maybe one or two characters. Here we are presented fourteen potentially amazing characters. They all have backstories, and half of them are ancient heroes (or villains) of legend. I sure as hell would have been a lot more invested in the characters if the show had gone deeper into some of their mythologies. It would have made certain aspects of the show feel much more meaningful, and I think it would have given some events more impact. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great, don't get me wrong, but even having said that, they could have been so much more.\\n\\n\r\nMy words aren't adequate for the task of describing how PERFECT this show's art is. Watch it yourself.\\n\\n\r\nJust kidding. I'll try to the best of my ability to capture the art in words.\\n\\n\r\nThe color palette is very dark, grey and unsaturated, which is fitting for the show. The animation is fluent, from the movements of fighting characters, to smoke coming out of an exhaust pipe. Speaking of the movements of characters, I'd like to point out that every character has their own way of carrying themselves, and I don't just mean in the way that they pose when they stand. They all have their own distinct way of moving, which shows how much the artists want to emphasize that these characters are unique. The use of gradients in coloration was a smart move by Ufotable, as it gives off a great effect of shading. Objects look almost three dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is done by Yuki Kajiura, and her orchestrations fit this show perfectly. There are tracks that get you hyped for a fight, and there are tracks that make you feel a character's sadness. The voice acting is great as well, at least for the Japanese dub. I haven't heard the English dub. The OPs for both seasons are good. I regret to say that I never really sat through the end of an episode to listen to the EDs, with the exception of a few episodes where the ED was different.\\n\\n\r\nDoes the plot lag at times? Yes. Do I see what they did to save animation budget? Yes. Could we have gotten more elaborate with the characters? Yes. Does that make Fate/Zero any less of an epic experience? Hell no. Fate/Zero is part of a dying breed of anime. The industry is slowly turning into a money grabbing competition, and there are fewer and fewer shows that are willing to give viewers an amazing experience, and there are more and more shows appearing that are selling tons because of a pair of tits flopping around on screen. I'm not saying that shows that pander to otakus are bad, I'm saying that I don't want them to be the only thing available. Fate/Zero didn't fail to deliver anything to its viewers. It's a personal favorite of mine, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\n+Interesting characters\\n\r\n+Moral ambiguity makes for a less black and white experience\\n\r\n+Visually gorgeous\\n\r\n+Soundtrack is great\\n\r\n+Engaging and thought-provoking dialogues\\n\r\n+Heavy themes are explored well\\n\r\n(+/-)Nihilistic\\n\r\n(+/-)Would have been better as a standalone series\\n\r\n-Plot lags at times\\n\r\n-Characters could have been explored more\\n\r\n-Ending might be seen as anticlimactic\\n\r\n-First episode is an info dump that could have been handled a lot better\\n\r\n-Little to no world building",

            "content": "Where do I begin with Fate/Zero? The first time I watched this series (roughly two years ago) I, admittedly, adored it. However, I recently rewatched it after reading the Fate/Stay Night light novel. It was then that my opinion of the seriess dropped substantially. Don't worry! This won't be a review where I bitch about how Fate/Zero messed up the characters that had been lovingly crafted in Fate/Stay Night! Indeed, I will try my best not to mention that wonderful novel (and godawful fanbase) and will instead focus on analyzing the content at hand. There will, however, be MILD SPOILERS. Consider yourself warned.The key problem with Fate/Zero is, in my mind, its characters, if you can call them that. When it comes to Urobuchi (the writer behind Psycho Pass, Madoka Magica, this, and some other stuff that nobody cares about), the main thing most critics complain about is the lack of good characterization. Urobuchi himself has admitted that when it comes to writing characters, the only way he knows how to develop them is to make them go insane. As a result, most of Urobuchi's characters have a tendency to come across as just tools of the writer rather than actual people. And yet, when it comes to Fate/Zero, the characters are often times given a free pass. The reason behind this is obvious, many of the characters that are present in Fate/Zero were also present Fate/Stay Night (don't worry, I'll talk about Rider and Waver later) and because of this, older watchers have a very positive knee-jerk reaction despte the fact that the characters in question aren't being written very well.\\n\r\nLet's start with the inexplicably popular protagonist of the series, Kiritsugu. Everyone's favorite edgelord. And that's exactly what he is, an edgelord. Kiritsugu is the gritty, badass, nigh-immoral hero who believes that the ends (saving as many people as possible) always justify the means (killing, backstabbinig, etc.). But he has a tragic backstory, is truly a nice person on the inside, and in the end he fully realizes the error of his ways and that by saving one person, he can save himself. And... thats about it. Thats all there is to the hero of this story. He has no funny quirks, no interesting personality traits that make him unique, no sideplots that make him seem more human (unless if you count the robotic and mildly creepy romance that he had going on with Irisviel or the wasted, near meaningless, and still somewhat creepy romance with Maiya). He isn't even a particularly well-developed character. All of his character development happens within the final two episodes of the series, and his entire backstory gets dropped over the course of two episodes 2/3 of the way through the series. Other than his typical stoic badass attitude and capabilities, nothing about Kiritsugu makes him likeable or unique. He's literally Homura.\\n\r\n    But what about the side characters? Kariya and Kirei are both good (they fall under Urobuchi's strong point: characters who develop via falling into darkness), but thats about it. Nobody gives a crap about Kayneth or Tokiomi, so I won't mention them. They're completely forgettable. Saber and Gilgamesh are both bland caricatures of what they were in Fate/Stay Night. In this, Gilgamesh's ego seems more like a funny quirk than a defining character trait established by a lifetime of unchallenged supremacy (Fate/Stay Night Gil would never have lost his shit over something as petty as being forced to stand on the same ground as somebody else, nor would he have literally rode Iskander's dick the way he did after Iskander failed. Shirou and Broserker both did one hundred times better than Iskander, and barely got acknowledged). And of course, Urobuchi makes sure to punish Saber for being an honorable person at every possible oppurtunity, even if it means changing the character in order to do so. A good example of this would be the King's Banquet scene, where Saber practically shits herself after Iskander says that she isn't a king because she didn't rule over her people like a tyrant. Now I'm no Seiba-fanboy (I now hate myself for having used that spelling) but the girl's never struck me as stupid. She should have been more than capable of defending herself against Iskander's reasoning, which was quite honestly retarded.\\n\r\n   And now we come to Iskander and Waver, the most popular yaoi couple in the anime. Waver isn't much to talk about, pretty much just your standard little-bitch-comes-of-age story. Iskander, on the other hand, is a selfish, two-dimensional Gary Stu prick who recieves hardly any development throughout the series, yet gets praised for his charisma and manliness. The problem with Iskander is that he is essentially the pet of Urobuchi in the story. He's always in the right (even when he's not), and is given lip-service by characters who would normally never do so (did I mention that Gilgamesh, who was originially one of the characterically egotistical characters in the history of anime, rides his dick to the moon?). It should be noted that Iskander's policy for kingship is essentially \"REAL LEADERS KNOW THAT LETTING YOUR PEOPLE KILL EACHOTHER IS OKAY BECAUSE IT MEANS YOU HAVE RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUALITY! FUCK THE PEOPLE, KINGS DO WHAT THEY WANT! THAT'S WHAT REAL LEADERSHIP IS!!\", and yet all the edgelords and sheep watching (and Urobuchi if the plot is any indicator) praise him for how badass and manly he is. What a joke of a character.\\n\r\n   As for the story? Its fine, though it suffers from the same problems that all stories with wish granting  magical plot devices suffer from (if you've seen Madoka Magica, you know what I'm talking about). The beginning sort of sucks, as the first two episodes are essentially a massive infodump. Obviously, it would have been better if that info had been dropped at a steadier rate throughout the series. And then there is the jarring two-episode flashback that I mentioned before, but other than that the plot is pretty good.\\n\r\n   Art? Sound? Its Ufotable. Next?\\n\r\n   All in all, Fate/Zero is a far more enjoyable series than I made it out to be in this review. I focused more on the negatives because practically everyone out there knows the positives. Its a well produced action anime with a good plot and an interesting fantasy element yet mostly boring or irritating characters (except for Kotomine-Goddamn-Badass-Get-Hyped-for-Heaven's-Feel-Greatness-Kirei). Overall, the series deserves 6.5-7. Oh, wait, Ilyasviel doesn't play a major role in this series? For that alone, I'm taking a point off!",

            "content": "Fate/Zero is the prequel to the well known and successfully debatable Fate/Stay Night series. As one might assume that Fate/Zero is your generic shounen or action anime, this is indeed very far from being true. As the series tells the experiences of the participants in the Holy Grail War, the differences between Fate/Stay and Fate/Zero are very prevalent right from the word go as the anime starts. Depicting a much darker setting and tone as well as its far more mature story than its predecessors, Fate/Zero hits on many elements which make a great anime.\r\nThrough a variety of different plot features such as the loreof the Holy Grail Wars and the descriptive character development of each participant the story is able to convey its entity. Expressive language is shown through the communications between characters and the endeavours which they encounter in their survival quest. Emotive story techniques such as the continuous backbone of drama and emotional strain on the characters are put in effect as the director Aoki, Ei was wanting to develop these features of the anime, through identification of these key ideas the story is enhanced and is able to engage the viewer into the anime's plot and world. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime Fate/Zero features contemporary modern anime art styles which are commonly seen in newer anime. As Fate/Zero is a 2011 production, one might assume that it has a lower quality of art to any of the newer 2013 anime, this is far from true. As the art is able to express the surroundings of the anime and is used as a tool to convince the viewer of a situation or characters identity, it makes it likeable and relate-able. The dark and colourful features help the viewer to feel a sense of connection to the characters as they are aesthetically pleasing to see when shown in their fantasy action battle scenes and calm intellectual conversations. The land scape and settings of the anime are also able to bring forth the same connections the viewer has.\\n\\n\r\nSound plays a large role in Fate/Zero and is also executed exceptionally well. Through the use of diegetic and non-diegetic sound the characters are brought to life as the soundtrack features many western style music tracks which help the viewer identify with the anime as well as once again, form connections to the characters, world and assist in the viewer feel engaged while watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters and specifically the protagonists in Fate/Zero are metaphorically crossing into a 'new world' as they advance through the story. They are able to break 'barriers' which determine whether they are capable of having a sense of belonging to their world and with each other as well as being able to stay alive in the anime's game-like survival environment and setting. It is worth mentioning that the characters are of a video-game type as they are classed into \"Archer, Lancer, Rider, Caster, Berserker and Assassin.\" This may create a reminiscent feeling for many viewers as they could relate to these roles as like in some MMORPGs. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is able to ad-hear to many aspects of what would make an enjoyable anime for its own genres. Fate/Zero successfully is able to make the viewer develop a sense of attachment and connection with the characters, plot and world as you are pulled through an adventure of survival and heroism. This anime is enjoyable if you are seeking an intelligent 'action, supernatural, fantasy, drama' with a developed story driven plot, likeable interesting characters and intellectual language techniques and engaging supernatural battles.",

            "content": "tired of ridiculous fan catering anime and manga with annoying wimpy protagonists and bad production values with terrible plot lines?\r\nyou've come to the right page. now please enjoy my first review.\r\nfate/zero is the prequel for the extremely popular fate/stay night visual novel.\r\nthe fate/stay night anime received mixed reactions and if you ask me, its extremely overrated.\r\nstudio deen known for butchering adaptations did it again. and the result wasn't pretty.\r\nfate/stay night was a pretty bad anime if you ask me, even if the animation was pretty good for its time.\r\nall the story was presented in the most boring way possible. the fights werent exciting, the voiceactors did a much better job on the obviously superior visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nand the unlimited blade works movie was a mixed bag of bad storytelling compared to the counterpart visual novel route. the only good things about the unlimited blade works movie were the animation and the fights.\\n\\n\r\nand then, in 2011, ufotable who is known for the amazing kara no kyoukai movies decided to adapt the fate/zero novel to a full fledged anime, spanning 25 episodes (after that it was decided that one cour will air on october 2011 and the other cour will air in april 2012).\\n\\n\r\nfinally, the talented type moon visual novel staff gets an excellent adaptation to their amazing work. i already forgotten about the tsukihime anime adaptation and fate stay night adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nstory - 10\\n\\n\r\nthe story may be not that original,  but even if its not original it doesnt mean its not good.\\n\\n\r\nseven masters fight a deadly battle for winning the holy grail war to acquire the holy grail and to fulfill their biggest desires. accompanying each master is a servant, and each servant is a heroic spirit summoned by magic from the past.\\n\\n\r\nthe concept is the same as the fate stay night visual novel, but with mostly different characters and different setting (10 years prior to the events of the fate stay night visual novel).\\n\\n\r\nthe story is battle of wits and strength. each master has a unique personality and each servant has a different measure of strength and heroism/anti-heroism. the servants fight for their masters and the masters command the servants splendidly. each master is a magus skilled in the arts of magic and the spirit of the masters and servants are connected.\\n\\n\r\njust from what im describing here you may already notice its not a silly generic romantic harem anime. it doesnt have any fanservice. it has a real story with believable characters and exciting setting and fights.\\n\\n\r\nthe story has no major flaws. its not presented in episodic fashion (a thing i really hate about anime). its like reading the novel, just animated. it doesn't stray from the original source material.\\n\\n\r\nart - 10\\n\\n\r\ni mentioned the kara no kyoukai movies. remember the animation in them? yes, the animation in fate/zero is movie-like, just in a tv series. ufotable did it again. and the result is very pretty.\\n\\n\r\nthe animation is extremely fluid. even the cg, that is usually bad in anime shows (gonzo, deen etc) is done extremely well. berserker is made from 100 percent cg. and he moves so good my eyes tear from the prettiness!\\n\\n\r\nsound - 10\\n\\n\r\nthe voice actors do an amazing job.\\n\r\nthe music is by kajiura yuki. i said enough.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter - 10\\n\\n\r\nnotable characters:\\n\\n\r\nsaber -  the best character in the series. she is also mai waifu.\\n\\n\r\nemiya kiritsugu - a magus that is an expert in firearms. this guy is a machine.\\n\\n\r\nkotomine kirei - this motherfucker is back, and more badass than ever.\\n\\n\r\nirisviel - adorable.\\n\\n\r\ngilgamesh - mongrels!\\n\\n\r\nrider - an extremely well written character. he and waver are one hell of a combo.\\n\\n\r\nlancer -  this guy shits heroism out of his ass. that's how heroic he is.\\n\\n\r\ncaster -  janneeeeee~! a bit of a freak. but i like him.\\n\\n\r\nassassins -  not much to say, aside that i like their design.\\n\\n\r\nkayneth - this dude is in my profile avatar. he's pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nkariya - being kariya is suffering.\\n\\n\r\nryuunosuke - a mass murderer. he and caster like to make people suffer in the most horrible ways.\\n\\n\r\nwaver - without rider this dude is invisible.\\n\\n\r\ntokiomi - i like his voice.\\n\\n\r\nloli sakura - oh god the suffering.\\n\\n\r\nloli rin - hngg.\\n\\n\r\nillyasviel - she doesn't have many appearances. she becomes much more important to the story in fate/stay night.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\ni cant remember how i enjoyed a series to this extent. a winning formula for every anime lover.\\n\\n\r\noverall - 10\\n\\n\r\nif you want to watch anime, don't watch some moe slice of life that swarms the market these days. you better watch something good, something with meaning and depth. watch fate/zero. read the fate/stay night visual novel. play fate/extra. thank me later.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Type-Moon have made a habit of finding success with their dark blend of magic and supernatural elements in modern day settings, but with the release of the Fate/Stay Night visual novel on the PC in 2004, the developer seemed to have found its flagship title. Unfortunately things never really work out the way people expect, and while Studio Deen's 2006 anime adaptation of the \"Fate\" storyline was well received by fans, many who were unfamiliar with the source material found it all a bit ... juvenile.\r\nAt the end of 2006 the developer began collaborating with Nitroplus in order to create a prequel light novel series,but this time the story was penned by the relatively unknown Urobuchi Gen (with Type-Moon co-founder Takeuchi Takashi providing illustrations). Set ten years before the events in the visual novel, Fate/Zero chronicles the events leading up to and during the fourth Holy Grail War in Fuyuki City, Japan - the same place where the battle will be held in Fate/Stay Night. After three successive failures in the contest, the Einzbern family recruits the notorious mercenary Emiya Kiritsugu, also known as the \"Mage Killer\" - a man who is willing to use whatever means are necessary to realise his goals.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, the other principal magic families - Matou and Tohsaka - are preparing for the coming conflict, and although the church is taking part as well, they have also sent someone to assist the Tohsaka family - Kotomine Kirei.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance it may seem as though Fate/Zero is just another action anime, but nothing could be further from the truth. The series has a very different tone than either Fate/Stay Night or Unlimited Blade Works, and in many ways it has more in common with the dark, brooding atmosphere of the Kara no Kyoukai movies. That said, the series does assume that the viewer has some familiarity with the franchise, but this is balanced by a much tighter plot than that of either of its predecessors, and more focus on preparation, planning, and even dialogue between the different parties. The result is that the narrative has far more depth and structure than one might expect in a supernatural action anime, and there are layers of subtext that are gradually added as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable aspects of Fate/Zero is that it's a far more mature story than the original visual novel or its adaptations, and unlike many other shows, there are very few occasions where the characters engage in pointless conflicts or endeavours. The series carefully tries to avoid insulting the viewer's intelligence by adopting a patient, methodical build-up to the action set pieces, and on many occasions the story focuses on information gathering and planning. In addition to this, the battle lines shift constantly as the combatants form short-term alliances in order to counter the moves of other opponents, but there's always the understanding that the foundation of these is nothing more than \"the enemy of my enemy\".\\n\\n\r\nIn truth, this anime has far better examples of tactics and strategy than anything found in Code Geass, and certain plots are Machiavellian enough to give Death Note a run for its money.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to production values, Fate/Zero could be considered the final evolution of everything Type-Moon and Ufotable have learned from each other during their long collaboration on the Kara no Kyoukai franchise. The series looks every bit as good as one might expect, and the darker colour palette is offset by the high standard of animation. That said, although the action sequences are fluid and very well choreographed, the real testament to the quality of Ufotable's work are the subtle differences in the way the characters move.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there are plenty of new faces in this prequel, it's actually the design of recurring characters like Sabre that really sets the standard. Fate/Stay Night's popularity turned her into one of the most iconic female leads in anime, but while she may appear to be exactly the same in Fate/Zero, there's an edge to her features and a preciseness to her movements that was missing in the original series. This fact is also true for the characters that are unique to this show, and even Tohsaka Rin's \"adventure\" has been given the same level of care and attention to detail.\\n\\n\r\nThe series opens with a well choreographed sequence that blends action with a montage of the main participants in the Holy Grail War, all set to the rather pacey rock song \"Oath Sign\" by LiSA. Each episode closes with \"Memoria\" by Eir Aoi, a bittersweet rock ballad that fits well with the images of the heroic spirits as pieces on a game board and at moments in their own history. Fate/Zero also has one of the most diverse scores in a 13 episode anime, with martial themes, operatic pieces, strange little tunes with drums or pianos as the major instrument, and more besides. The audio effects or of a very high quality, and the clash of steel on steel is as sharp and clear as the sound of the lightning whenever Rider makes a dramatic appearance.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the areas where Fate/Zero excels is the dialogue, and while there are occasions where conversations go on a bit too long, the script is intelligently written, rational, and insightful. One of the best examples of this is Rider's discourse on the true nature of kingship and Saber's reaction to it, but even that is nothing more than words on paper as everything lies in the delivery - so it's a good thing that the acting is of a high standard.\\n\\n\r\nKawasumi Ayako reprises her role as the King of Knights (Saber/Arturia) from Fate/Stay Night and Unlimited Blade Works, but her performance here is markedly different. Her portrayal of Saber is colder, deadlier, and far more focused than before, while Tomokazu Seki's performance as the King of Heroes (Archer/Gilgamesh), is more arrogant, more proud. That said, it's Ootsuka Akio in the role of the King of Conquerors (Rider/Iskander), who really steals the show, and his testosterone-fuelled proclamations and battle-born wisdom are one of the pillars that support the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to development, a large group of characters often means that some will undoubtedly fall by the wayside. Fate/Zero neatly sidesteps the entire issue of development because it's first and foremost a prequel of an existing story, but in addition to this the series has created a set of individuals who leave extremely strong impressions on the viewer, and much like Baccano!, there is a distinct lack of a true main character. Because of these factors the series can focus on showing how each of the combatants became what they are, and this plays a major part in one's enjoyment of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe emphasis on characterisation rather than development allows for a remarkable degree of definition, and although it's ultimately the personalities of each individual that captures the viewer's attention, standing at the top of them all is the King of Conquerors - Rider. His addition to the franchise has been nothing short of a revelation, and while die-hard fans will continue to worship the ground that Saber and Archer (not Gilgamesh, the other one), walk on, Rider's enjoyment of life, his exuberance and almost boyish eagerness for battle and glory, have captured the imaginations of many fans.\\n\\n\r\nIn many respects he, more than any other character, is the epitome of the heroes of old, but simply having a bunch of overzealous combat junkies beating each other to a pulp isn't really entertainment (unless you have an IQ equal to your shoe size), so there has to be something to balance it - and there is. Each of the mages taking part in the Holy Grail War is more like a chessmaster, planning as many moves ahead as possible, whilst preparing themselves for anything their opponents may try.\\n\\n\r\nThe simple fact is that Fate/Zero wouldn't work as either a story or entertainment if it was just the mages or the heroes, and it's this aspect of the series that separates it from not just its predecessors, but also many other action anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately it's not all sweetness and light.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main criticisms of this series is the episode about the young Tohsaka Rin, which many people found unnecessary. Now although there's some truth to that perception, one could also have the opinion that Rin's actions tie-in to an event in the previous episode, and together they lead up to the end of the series. Both are fair arguments, but in all honesty the whole thing doesn't really fit with the rest of the anime, and it seems like nothing more than an attempt to allow Matou Kariya some long overdue screen-time.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero isn't a perfect show, but while it does have several minor issues (and one \"filler\" episode), it does exactly what it sets out to do - capture the attention of the audience and make them want more. The story is intelligent, and while conversations and discussions can sometimes feel a little tedious, the dialogue is often quite interesting - moreso than the show's predecessor's anyway. Although the series can boast stylish, fast-aced action set-pieces, it also studiously avoids combat for the sake of gratuitous violence.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Fate/Zero is still a prequel series, and at this point only half of the story has been told. Unfortunately the anime industry has a habit of messing things up, but given the quality of this show, the fact that the original story was written by Urobuchi Gen, and the knowledge that the series is being produced by Type-Moon's long time collaborators - Ufotable, fans can be cautiously optimistic about the second installment.\\n\\n\r\nAll we can do is wait and see ...",

            "content": "Being the prequel of the well known franchise Fate/Stay Night, Fate/zero certainly captured the attention of many very easily. What is immediately clear about this production though is not only does it match its predecessor, it far surpasses it in every way imaginable. Whether it be the directing, visuals, character exposition, or anything you can possibly think of, Fate/zero manages to move into a class of its own. In the end, this all adds up to a much more complex and interesting tale, which one will certainly not be soon to forget.\r\nThe very base of Fate/Zero is no different from Fate/Stay Night. It revolves aroundsomething called the Holy Grail War, a war between 7 magus or masters (Magic users) who through the power of the grail summon heroic spirits who are people of legend, historical fame, or myth to do battle with each other to claim ownership of the grail which is said to be able to grant the owner any wish. But while the base of this story is pretty much the same as Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Zero is decidedly more dark, gritty, and violent. Any viewer who has taken care to watch the predecessor may initially be disoriented by tonal shifts in the universe, but if one is willing to move past this, there is undoubtedly a rewarding experience awaiting.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several things that Fate/Zero does impeccably well, but perhaps one of the most easily enjoyable aspects of the show is the chess like manner in which the war is carried out. The conflicts are enthralling in many ways, but what adds an extra layer of enjoyment to the show is how each move made by the characters is a well thought out, planned action. The masters constantly balance every decision with pros and cons and tries to maneuver through the war in the best manner possible. The war does not consist of mindless brawling and action and it is usually the best prepared individuals that benefit the most throughout the story. As a result, the action in this show is much more layered and hence captivating than that of your standard action show.\\n\\n\r\nOf course though, this show is about much more than seeing entertaining action, and cool magical powers. What the show really is at its heart is a very engrossing spiritual journey. The cast, particularly the masters and servants, are all engaged in a battle that defines their goals, wishes, and motivations in life. They all engage in a conflict for which their fate is solely in their own hands. Each character is forced to understand themselves and their foes as they continue on their quest. Indeed, Fate/Zero is very much so a character study, and a very captivating one at that. This is primarily owed to its excellent cast that surely will manage to intrigue just about anybody willing to look beyond the on the surface elements of the Fate universe.\\n\\n\r\nAn interesting note about the cast in Fate/Zero though is that it mostly consists of older men. This is particularly noteworthy because so few anime today dare to make a cast of older men. It showcases just how a story with older cast members, even if they are men, can be quite entertaining and that perhaps the same old tired formulas do not always need to be employed to reach certain audiences. A story does not always have to be about high school kids, and hopefully this show can set an example of that.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that most certainly not be forgotten though in this story is just how much it excels at the simple things. Of course as always, studio Ufotable provides excellent visuals (Though perhaps a bit stagnant at times in animation), the show has very solid direction, a very nice OST as displayed again by the talented Yuiji Kaijura, and excellent writing as expected of the now famed Urobuchi Gen. Perhaps most of all though is that Fate/Zero manages to capture the essence of its source material supremely well. This is made apparent by even the littlest of details such as the way they truly make the servants seem super human in their abilities compared to their masters or the way they frame the dialogues between the characters as they quibble over their philosophies, hopes and goals. Little touches like these just add so much more to the experience and really display how much care and effort are put into the production. This is something I felt was sorely missing in Fate/Stay Night, much to its detriment.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately Fate/Zero is a high class production. It is something that can be both thrilling, and intellectually satisfying at the same time. It displays a level of care and detail that anyone should be able to appreciate. But most of all, Fate/Zero is a quality piece of entertainment that one will certainly not be soon to forget.\\n\\n\\n\r\n****NOTE****\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is a prequel of Fate/Stay Night. Some of the differences between the two can be quite shocking since really, the Fate/Stay anime was an extremely poor adaption by Studio DEEN. For newcomers into the Fate universe I highly suggest if you can to instead play the Fate/Stay Night game in preparation for watching Fate/Zero if you are interested enough. It is an extremely enjoyable story, that I think is every bit as good as Fate/Zero and I think should really be experienced the way it was meant to be experienced. This means none of DEEN's budget cutting, anime original arc injections, poor scripting, etc. If there is one thing that was made extremely obvious during Fate/Zero it's that Ufotable gets Fate, and DEEN does not. The level of difference between the two studios in their renditions of the Fate universe  is truly incomparable as Ufotable's adaption leaves DEEN's adaption in the dust.",

            "content": "I\u2019m fairly confident this review is going to get near as damn 0% helpful marks simply because of my ratings. If anyone feels what I said wasn\u2019t helpful in this review, drop me a message, if you disagree with something I said, drop me a message, thanks. \r\nStory \u2013 3\r\nOh dear\u2026 \r\nFirstly,  I think it is a bit of a cheat essentially splitting fate zero into two separate series, so that all the good bits can be condensed into \u2018one\u2019 of those series. Nonetheless, I will still assess this as a single series, in terms of setting the stage for the second season.\r\nFate Zerohas a great set up. A survival game with some interesting aspects (such as the wish granting prize and the involvement of the church) as well as 7 moderately even teams (in terms of likeability and development). At its earliest points, it is unclear who is going to win this survival game, but, rather disappointingly, this quickly deteriorates into having a clear ultimate winner. This can still be equally as successful however, as long as this group has a stronger underlying connection with the story. Which is more or less covered in the second season.  \\n\\n\r\nFate Zero suffers with a great depravation of detail. Although I\u2019m sure the manga and novels cover this, it can\u2019t be an excuse to not cover anything at all. I am at a loss as to why the church is involved (was Jesus a hero?), why absolutely none of the world gives a single flying shit about entire cities getting threatened with destruction. The same is true with the history of the Holy Grail wars; did they have a single impact on anything we are currently watching? Do the writers have a single bloody clue about the heroes in Fate Zero? (I think not, ie, don\u2019t try and make yourself look clever by saying this is a historical figure, then change their name, characteristics, life story and even gender) Etc. This lack of detail also seems to be confusing the participants of the game, half of them don\u2019t know what is going on. Nor why they are even involved. Lazy.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, and this is what really grinded my gears, Fate zero (season one) has absolutely no balls. It is never willing to dramatically change the course of the survival game. All we ever see is a series of straight forward fight scenes with no conclusions and loads of conversations on who is the most noble champion. I accept that this is the first season, but with literally no progress and a very basic set up in terms of detail, it raises the question whether the first season was even needed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 7\\n\r\nIdeal for this genre. Entertaining and one dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nThere is an interesting relationship between the heroes and their respective masters. Each hero is their own individual with their own ambitions, which often conflict with their masters. Three command spells that demand absolute obedience are all the masters have to keep their servants in check. The relationship between the master and servant is crucial in this survival game and is well covered in this anime.  \\n\\n\r\nEvery character offers a different attitude on the battlefield and character interactions can be quite intense. This is well embodied by the fact that, in the most cases, the servant is nearly a complete opposite of their master. These conflicts make for some interesting interactions seeing that they have to work together to achieve the same goal. \\n\\n\r\nHaving such a large cast of characters, and having each character\u2019s attitudes exaggerated (for entertainment purposes) tends to strip the realism of the show. The clich\u00e9 characters in Fate Zero are largely responsible for the overall childish atmosphere (as well as the fight scenes themselves).  Which could well be what you are after, but this is something to keep in mind. \\n\\n\r\nArt and music- 9\\n\r\noutstanding\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation was phenomenal. The fight scenes were choreographed very well and they were truly a sight to behold. If only the scenery was something more stunning than a dockyard. The soundtrack, as you may know was composed by Yuki Kajiura (composer of Sword art online and mahou shoujo madoka magica for example). She has her own distinct style and if you liked any of her other works, I\u2019m sure you will also like this soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment \u2013 2\\n\r\nEergh\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nIf my personal disdain hasn\u2019t already been evident, here is my chance to make it clear. Firstly, I\u2019ve never been a fan of an action based anime. It always gets out of hand and fate zero isn\u2019t an exception. Unfortunately, Fate Zero doesn\u2019t have much else to offer besides the action. This thus limits how intelligent the anime can be. The best it can do is detail certain moves or powers of the heroes, and it tries to do this with the idea of a noble phantasm. This said power is essentially a secret and extremely powerful move that each hero has, that supposedly stems from their history. These end up having such vague connections and meanings and are all RIDICULOUSLY convenient to the situation. Poor effort.  Lastly, Fate zero needs to grow some balls. 13 episodes of literally no advancements in the survival game was so frustrating and it felt like a huge waste of time. The fights were nice though. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, Fate Zero 2nd Season advances almost immediately and thus is instantly more enjoyable. Just to be clear, this review isn\u2019t a response to an irrational hatred of the fate zero universe. Far from it, I liked the second season a great deal, and I can see that with the detail that the manga could possibly offer, it can be really great. But as it stands, Fate Zero the anime is a rather pointless and is not needed for the second season. \\n\\n\r\nAs this is such a highly rated anime, I would love to hear from those that do think this is amazing, because I need some convincing.  \\n",

Fate/Zero is one of them, and i believe it has the potential to be one of the best anime of the year.\r\nStory wise, it's been following the light novel consistently with great precision, picking up almost every single finest detail that are required to elaborate the story into a fine piece. The battle scenes are just simply amazing, you could never get enough of the fighting scenes, some of the episodes filled with action just make your blood boiled when you watch them. The way how theyassemble the servants together and the relationship in between the servants are also being depicted clearly. I have to say ufotable is doing a great job thus far, their ability to illustrate the art of fate series are second to none. Sound wise, the OP and the ED are just simply amazing. Watching the ED especially brings you into the story, making you wanting to know which era and where does every single servant comes from, and the story behind them in their respective era. \\n\\n\r\nI've watched up to 5 episodes thus far and i only have but one line to say - oh my god its so just damn amazing i almost jizzed my pants off.",

            "content": "Ufotable probably used the Holy Grail and granted the fan's wish.most of the fans turned their attention to fate/zero the moment they heard about the involvement of ufotable since they knew they could expect great things with other works they had seen from them.as we all know just having a good story won't make an anime good.how to adapt it and include the parts of the story,the good use of music and art and many other things are playing a big role in an anime.this anime didn't disappoint and tried hard to bring out the awesomeness.\r\nStarting with the story the anime made a good useof the rich materials it had and the story can be considered one of the great parts.the Events of the story and the dialogues are not cliche or random and most of them happens for a reason and should be taken seriously since fate/zero is not just about battles.Fate/zero happened 10 years before Fate/stay night and the wars of the Holy Grail are about to begin once again.(those that are familiar with the wars can skip this part.the grail first appeared when three great Magus family decided to share their knowledge with each other to summon the holy grail in order to achive the roots of all knowledges.but they realized that the grail can only grant one wish and since they originally had different wishes the wars for the holy grail got started.in each war some masters with the desire for the grail gets chosen and will be granted a servant and three command seals.these masters will have to fight with each other under the control of a judge to win the grail that can grant them their wish.the servants are heroic spirits from our past or future or our legends and the masters are mostly magus with great power or desire for the grail.\\n\r\nnow the 4th war is beginning and the Tohsaka family had a good history with the church and got help from them.the Einzbern family hired the famous Magus killer Kiritgusu Emiya and Zouken from the Matou family is using any mean possible to attend this war or getting prepared for the next one.there are other masters as well like Kayneth from the Archibald family or even masters without any famous magus family that got their chance to participate in this war by luck or their hidden desires.)\\n\r\neven though there are some unexplained things in the anime it is still very enjoyable because of the unexpected events and good character design .a good example of character design can be seen in the combination of Masters and Servants.you can almost be interested in all master and servant combinations.for example even if you find Velvet character uninteresting his servant will make up for it big time.as for a bad example i can name assassin since in my opinion the fate universe doesn't like this class.another good thing about it is the protagonist Kiritsugu Emiya which although has a cliche emo attitude he is still enjoyable more than Shirou Emiya in Fate/stay night Route at least but then again this is a matter of opinion.most of the characters are complicated and this makes them interesting and force the audience to think about them.although one things that may bother you is how they survive most of their battles several times even though their death flag is up but still it is enjoyable.one of the great things about F/z is that you can understand F/sn character's background which left unexplained in f/sn anime Specially Sakura and Kotomine.(which is a good thing for those that are not familiar with the VN or LN).speaking about Kotomine he is one of the best examples of character development and the audience can see how he became what he is with the temptations of Gilgamesh with his snake-like eyes at the end of episode 12(tokiomi used the first skin of snake that got shed to summon him ironically)\\n\\n\r\nthe art looks very good at first glance considering this is a TV-series anime since it reminded me of another work of Ufotable named Garden of Sinners which was an OVA(and another work by TypeMoon).while the enviroment is dark the battles are flashy and when the art is weird you should expect something big since they are saving the budget for the real deal like the 10th episode with Alexander's Noble Phantasm.they also did the Berserker design in CGI which was weird at first but it fits him and makes him special.the art is clean,shiny and devilishly mysterious that fits the story well. \\n\\n\r\nthe Soundtracks may not get your attention until the very end of episode 1 when the summoning begins.and after that there is the next episode OP(counts as the first episode ED)which i think Lisa did a great job.after that there is the real ED from Aoi Air named Memoria that can be seen in the next episode which also gives us a little peak to the servant's legends which is cool.after all of these the battles finally got started and here in my opinion they did a great job on each character's theme specially Berserker which you can here the enchant of Berserker in it like the Sephiroth soundtrack(One-Winged Angel)in FFVII Series.as for voice acting they used some real talented people and most of the people from the VN or f/sn anime got their roles back.they have the sweet voice of Sayaka Ohara for Irisviel(although i think she could do better),and for the protagonist we have the voice of Rikiya Koyama which is the best choice for these kind of characters.for Zouken they got Masane Tsukayama and he did a great job in Kaiji as Hyoudou and both characters resemble each other(and most of the people can recognize him since the second season of Kaiji aired recently).although there are characters that are not talking yet like berserker since he will only make noises for this season but the awesome soundtrack makes up for it.overall they did a good job in this part and used an epic-dark theme in their songs that fits the fate universe.\\n\\n\r\nI tried and recommended the show to some of my friends.some liked it for its historical references or the art and some for its story even though some of em didn't even like animes before.this cannot be considered for everyone and i can't say that this show is for every kind of taste but since it didn't just count on one aspect like story,while it can have its own flaws it can satisfy a vast range of audiences.\\n\r\ncombination of a good story and character design,good soundtracks and good art makes this one of the good animes of 2011 that is recommended for those that needs some adrenaline rush.",

            "content": "I wrote a review for Fate/Zero before but it got deleted because it only talked about the fight scenes. So I'm including the story in this review as well. Enjoy. \r\nWarning: spoilers. \r\nThe story can be summed up in two words: Forced Grimdark. Characters suffer and die for no apparent reason other than to make the show darker and edgier. [spoiler]Why was Kariya even in there? Most of these characters don't even become relevant until FSN. That Rin episode was fucking awful, it had no relevance to the plot whatsoever. As was the Kiritsugu backstory which I thought was two long episodes of nothing butforced drama. Kiritsugu keeps being put into implausible situations where he has to kill his own parents. He killed father because \"he might accidentally turn everyone into zombies\". Natalia forgets to bring a parachute on a mission where she's on a plane containing wasps that turn people into zombies because MUH FEELS. Kiritsugu could have put Avalon into Maiya healing her wounds instantly instead of letting her die, but didn't, because MUH FEELS. Lancer died like a bitch because MUH FEELS. Totally didn't steal \"lancer kill yourself\" from the original FSN. Kariya strangles Aoi even though we're told earlier on that he loves her because MUH FEELS. Why are there so many irrelevant characters and why do they all have to die in the most pathetic way possible? Example: Iskander. Big hearted and funny guy right? Better kill him off in the most retarded way possible to increase MUH FEELS. And yes, it is retarded because Iskander had absolutely no reason to gallop 5 miles away from Gilgamesh when he could have put Gilgamesh slap bang into the middle of Ionian Hetairoi giving him no chance to pull out Ea. It's funny because the historical Alexander the Great was a shrewd and cunning general, the polar opposite of the F/Z Iskander. Was the serial killer couple put in there for any reason other than to make the anime darker and edgier? This is what I call forced grimdark - having characters suffer and kill each other for no reason other than to make the viewer sad. [/spoiler]\\n\\n\r\nFight scenes are badly directed. I could pick out so many things wrong with Fate/Zero fights. In all Lancer vs Saber fights, all they do is talk talk talk and compliment each other on their skills. They're not even trying to kill each other. The Kariya vs Tohsaka fight was fucking dumb. It was just Kariya throwing wasps at Tohsaka. \"Huh, wasps all getting burned to crisp? Throw more wasps!\". The Berserker vs Gilgamesh \"fight\" was just Gilgamesh is throwing weapons at Berserker. The \"dogfight\" was just Berserker going pew pew at Archer. All of Berserker scenes are painful to watch because of the terrible CG. The Kiritsugu vs Kirei battle was fucking dumb. Why was it set in the fucking batcave? There's no lead-up whatsoever. The entire fight consisted of Kirei punching Kiritsugu in the chest, Kiritsugu shooting Kirei in the hand, and then the retarded knife blocking scene. Kiritsugu managed to get hit with the most telegraphed punch to the chest in the history of the universe. He had like 10 minutes to react. A 1 year old could have dodged it. I don't understand why they wasted the animation budget on slow-motioning this scene with single framing when it was just Kiritsugu getting punched in the chest, whilst really fast scenes like Kirei throwing his black keys only got double framed, which made it difficult to see what happened. He didn't even try to dodge or block it, he was just standing there not doing anything. Fucking dumb. The next scene was even dumber. Kirei getting shot in the hand was just stupid. Not to mention the massive anticlimax with the black mud crashing through the batcave ceiling JUST AS Kirei and Kiritsugu are about to kill each other. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe most annoying thing about the fight scenes is that the movements look wooden and robotic. Characters standing still just moving their arms. There is distinct lack of whole body movement. You can see in the Kirei vs Kiritsugu fight that all Kirei does is move his arm when blocking Kiritsugu's attacks. The rest of his body is completely still, not showing any changes at all, not even redrawn for like 20 frames. This is just laziness. \\n\\n\r\nI might mention again the level of disjointedness in the fight scenes. I've said before that the Saber vs Berserker fight scenes were completely disjointed, as in consecutive scenes did not even match each other. If you look at any of the fight scenes closely you'll see that disjointedness permeates from the highest to the lowest level. The Maiya vs Kirei fight scene was disjointed in that one scene shows Maiya's knife hand being deflected by Kirei's right hand, and the next frame shows Kirei's left hand grabbing Maiya's wrist, with no intermediate scene that shows how we got from here to there. The scenes don't match each other at all. The animation is not smooth, as in one second it speeds up and another second it slows down again randomly. This is a prime example of bad directing. \\n\\n\r\nSummary: All of the Fate Zero fight scenes were underwhelming due to the stiff, awkward and wooden movements and disjointed action sequences.",

            "content": "The main flaws with this anime are that it's dialogue heavy and the fights are ultimately pointless.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe \"Holy Grail War\" is a battle royale with 7 sets of Masters/Servants partnering together to take out the other 6, winner gets the Holy Grail, which grants a miracle. Masters can use magic or guns to fight, or are completely useless in battle, some staying far away from the action. The servants all have a fighting style unique to their \"class\", Lancer uses spears, Saber uses a sword, Assassin is an assassin...you get the point. A few more people are thrown in to the war to makethings more interesting. Sounds good right? Of course it does.\\n\\n\r\nI love me some good planned out fights with logical strategies, thinking about the end game. Unfortunately, that is only the way a few of the masters think. The rest of the cast either does no planning at all or has a plan but then gets pissed and lashes out in anger. With nearly every fight ending anticlimactically with one character (often an enemy) jumping in and saving another at the last second, or retreating after a defeat, the plot has barely moved at all in 13 episodes. Episode 10 served almost no purpose, as it revolves around a daughter of a master, Rin, a side character, with only a couple minor plot points.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nIn the beginning the animation was some of the worst I've seen in the past decade, but after it gets its head on straight it does a fine job. Fight scenes are well animated. Facial expressions are pretty hit or miss. Backgrounds are well done. The fog/lighting also stood out. Be aware that they use CG to animate Berserker.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe Opening song is decent, the ending song is nothing special. Background music goes for a minimalist approach and succeeds, nothing special about it, nothing bad, it sets the tone for the most part. Voice acting and sound effects are average/slightly above average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nWith over a dozen \"main\" characters, it's hard to make them all unique and memorable. About a third of the characters are, a third are generic and can quite accurately be described in one word, and the other third have basically the same personality. \\n\\n\r\nBerserker gets so little screen time it's criminal. Assassin was downright disappointing. Rider easily has the most appealing personality out of the servants. Caster and his master are serial killing psychopaths who would rather kill random people then participate in the war. Very few characters have any development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nThe main reason I couldn't fully enjoy this anime is that almost all the characters are still around, with only 1, maybe 2 of the characters dying or otherwise no longer being able to participate in the war. With characters saving enemies from certain demise for no reason other than honor, when they are trying to eliminate each other, it leads me to the conclusion that honor is just another way to say ass-pull.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime? Yes. Do you absolutely have to watch it? No. \\n\\n\r\nIf you can get past the long conversations and anticlimactic fights, give it a shot. It is an above average anime.",

            "content": "This show is unsalvageable. Its openly one of the many horrible overrated shows I've watched. I have never been so unbelievably bored over a greek god death tournament anime. Yes that is the premise yet it is tedious nonsense with a weak script, terrible characters, & piss poor animation. \r\nWant to know what you'll experience? Exposition. This show is 97 percent exposition. Characters are worthless, bleak, pathetic, & annoying. They serve the plot and have no personalities.The show has a great premise: greek gods death tournament to win a godly prize. However it is TERRIBLE IN EXECUTION. Every character is rushed things are forced. Forexample: A married couple of eight years in the first episode do heavy exposition for the story. The husband says something like, \"I must kill you\" and she goes \"Lol its cool\". The scene doesn't make sense. Nobody talks like this especially a married couple with a child. \\n\\n\r\nThe females in this show are extremely unlikable and irritating. They have a \"badass\" female as the lead yet in every fight she is saved by males at the last minute. Meanwhile, the other females are cheerleaders who exist to suck off the men. They have nothing going for them other than that.\\n\\n\r\nNothing HAPPENS. I'm serious the fights have no consequences as everyone just walks away. They make threats that the next fight will be the end. However, the end never comes. Characters in a \"death tournament\" make all the excuses in the world to avoid killing each other! Its excuses like, 'you're wounded so I cant', 'you're up against two its not fair', 'I want to see you suffer'. GET BLOODY ON WITH IT. This is a death tournament! What is with all the excuses that are used in 90 percent of the show. At one point a character is about to shoot another one across a building but stops do to him being forced to withdraw by another character. WHY DID HE STOP? The guy in question was about to order his greek god to kill his wife! This show is laughable in how stupid & horribly written it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe show rails on and on with exposition but I could hardly make out what the hell was happening. So much useless dull info dumping that went nowhere. Every outcome became predictable & trite. The fans say this is fun & exciting? This is top tier overhyped misery porn. And its not even good misery porn. \\n\\n\r\nThe fights are animated horribly. You get one hit then narration. Another hit then narration. It seriously looks like a cheap video game in how its designed. Its no surprise this is based off a hentai game. This is worthless violence for uninspired annoying bleak characters. \\n\\n\r\nI have never loathed a show this much its near laughable for how mad it drove me. Gantz is a violent death alien tournament anime with slow pacing, cringe writing, & mean spirited characters and it is ONE THOUSAND PERCENT more interesting & fun than this. Watch that instead. \\n\\n\r\nStay away from this it is not worth your time nor sanity \\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nTRASH",

            "content": "When I first started this anime, I thought it was very good, but then it took a turn for the worse and became piss poor. Why you say? Maybe because every character falls into a generic archetype, such as, Irisvile (weak defenseless female), Saber ( strong female), and a boring protagonist who hardly ever shows up, and is apparently cheating on his wife. Now getting to the story, for the most part, it consists of Irisvile clinging to Saber's underwear while acting as a defenseless female who has no where better to be but involved in this Grail War which the shows speaks of alot. The pacing is absolutely horrendous, constantly wasting episodes upon episodes on fights that don't result in a servant getting defeated; basically, people just show up and leave, not progressing the story at all in any way or form. However, despite all these negatives, the only positive aspect is the graphics/ art, they are incredible, but this does not excuse a show of as poor quality as Fate/ Zero.",

A journey of epic proportions in a well-grounded mythological world based on reality, a masterpiece\u201d\r\nREVIEW FREE OF SPOILERS!\r\nAs I have stated before in my reviews I\u2019ve been watching anime shows for a short period of time -3 years-. And as I\u2019ve said before, thanks to the help/aid of some of my friends, I\u2019ve had one of the best beginnings/introductions to the anime world, and here\u2019s where \u201cFATE/\u2026\u201d comes in, more specifically FATE/STAY NIGHT. [I know this is a \u201cFATE/ ZERO\u201d review]\r\nFATE/S. N. Was the third anime that I watched. I\u2019ve been a fan of magic stories since I can remember,and when you connect: Magic, the modern world and a \u201cdark\u201d \u201cmysterious\u201d mood in the story you have my whole attention \u2013as long as the story is interesting of course-.\\n\\n\r\nSo naturally after watching \u2013and loving it- FATE/S.N.  I heard that the prequel of FATE/ S.N. was going to be broadcast, so obviously, I was ecstatic.\\n\r\nBack in the day I didn\u2019t really knew about the previous story of \u201cFATE/\u2026\u201d except for the things that where told on STAY NIGHT. So I knew  was going to be on an amazing journey on this new chapters/episodes.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s begin\u2026! :D\\n\\n\r\n-STORY: 10-\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly it\u2019s a masterpiece. From the first seconds of the first episode, I could see that the story/idea had matured, it wasn\u2019t a show focused \u2013mainly- for a younger audience, now it was darker, more mature story. It revealed more, the preparations that the main characters/fighters had. Comparing S.N. with ZERO, ZERO immerses you -from the start- in the lives of those who were about to compete for the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d, revealing not just characters and situations but the mythology behind it all, AND the magic in it, giving it \u2013the show- a well-grounded myth and not just a plain story that will unfold in the next episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in the occult, or the mysteries, or simply if you like well-founded or good \u201depic\u201d stories this IS the anime for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-ART: 10- \\n\r\nColorful. Probably the first thing that catches everyone\u2019s eyes from F/Zero is the Art. The animation IS flawless, perfect, an \u201ceye-candy\u201d to call it somehow. The surrounding ambient is perfectly detailed and believable and the characters are mesmerizing to the point in which you ask yourself what will come on the near future.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in art design, by all means this is for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-SOUND: 10-\\n\r\nPersonally I\u2019m a guy that places the \u201csound/music\u201d of a show as one of the most important things of all. And I must say the ambient sounds and music of this show are hypnotizing. Leaving aside the \u201cambient\u201d sound which are breathtaking and perfect I will \u201ctalk\u201d mainly of the music behind the anime.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack/score of this anime was composed by Yuki Kajiura (Sword Art Online I & II, Pandora Hearts and Noir)\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura\u2019s work in this anime is as usual \u2013for her- a work beyond words. To put it bluntly the first song of the score \u201cFate to Zero\u201d resumes her work perfectly. Its dark, it\u2019s sad, it makes your skin crawl reaching deep in your bones, it\u2019s a soundtrack filled with emotions, and it\u2019s a work of epic proportions, a journey into the dark world of \u201cFATE\u201d. A very memorable soundtrack. \\n\r\nA-MUST-HEAR-SOUNDTRACK.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like/love or you\u2019re just interested in not great but amazing music arrangements, this is the show for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER: 10-\\n\r\nFATE/ZERO shines for its uniqueness and most importantly for the uniqueness of its characters. This is one of those shows that have a very high amount of MC\u2019s. Usually I avoid this kind of shows/movies for they fail amazingly in one important aspect: the focus, and this \u2013the focus- is one of the most remarkable things in this anime, each character or correctly put each \u201cgroup\u201d of characters is given a very important place/moment. Each one has their own goal and believes which makes each and every one of these characters believable and most importantly, you can get \u201cclose\u201d to them.\\n\\n\r\nAnother incredible aspect of the characters within \u201cFATE/ ZERO\u201d is the \u201ccharacter development\u201d department in which many shows fail \u2013which is not the case of FATE- Each character changes, matures during the whole season/show. Some change ideologies, some find a new way to fulfill their beliefs, revealing things of themselves to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in character development THIS IS your show. \\n\\n\\n\r\n-ENJOYMENT & OVERALL: 10-\\n\r\nFATE/ ZERO is one of those shows that leaves you wanting more, and not because they fail to answer things, it leaves you wanting more because of the superb way the show is made.\\n\\n\r\nAnother masterpiece in my books.\\n",

            "content": "I'm sorry, but this anime is simply atrocious.\r\nI honestly don't understand the appeal of Fate/Zero at all. It's been praised by so many and it has a really high rating, however, I just can't stomach it. Mind you, there are some minor spoilers of first four episodes just to be able to shed light on why I rated the show so low without being automatically reported. Not that it won't happen regardless.\r\nFirst episode has to be the most boring, pointless episode I ever watched. Absolutely no effort was made to spark the interest of the viewer or to summarize the story properly. It threw atyou an enormous amount of information about many miscellaneous things in an incredibly monotonous voice and without any proper order. Throughout the entire episode there was nothing that kept me engaged whatsoever. As if I'm supposed to be intrigued and eagerly listen to ominous, rambling, mumbling old men in robes telling us something of great importance is coming.\\n\\n\r\nSecond episode had some seriously annoying and edgy characters introduced. Waver Velvet - incredibly annoying character who all he does is whine in a super annoying voice. Waver Velvet's familiar or whatever it's called, the summoned guy, the 'i'm the strongest'. *googles* Rider, right. Awful character. And he has over 5000 favorites?\\n\r\nThen we got the edgy scene where they brutally kill a kid with apparently some straight out of hentai tentacles to appear to be dark and serious. Then I realized, this show must have been made for fourteen year olds, and reading through the comments nothing was more obvious than that. \"This got so dark!\" or \"Giglamesh is so cool!\" were some of the comments I encountered.\\n\r\nAh, yes, you dear naive teen, just wait five years when you realize how bad one-dimensional characters Ryuunosuke Uryuu (literally read his description) and Caster (I'm evil cuz I'm evil! Fear me!) are.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point I was already exhausted from nauseating boredom and cringing from awfully designed characters, but I decided not to give up yet, because I believed there had to be something interesting about the show. The fight scenes must be beyond interesting, should be absolutely ecstatic, I'm sure, because that's the reason so many people praise the series. I was deeply disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn't even remember the third episode even though I just watched it so I went to skip through it again just to remind myself what was happening in it. Ah, yes, we were following the life of aforementioned Waver and Rider, more old men in robes mumbling and towards end apparently some affair got revealed, at which point I couldn't care less about. I watched it three times and haven't remembered a thing, that's how much of an intriguing episode it was.\\n\\n\r\nFinal episode I watched before deciding to throw this back into abyss, was FINALLY some actual action. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, and dear slaughtered children. Something was actually happening in this episode, besides idle chat or boring monotonous speeches. Unfortunately, sixty seconds in I realized I'm not going to have fun watching it nor I am planning on continuing the anime past this point. The first fight was turned into a series of inner and outer monologues and made my immersion completely impossible and I couldn't keep bearing it.\\n\\n\r\nI tried to like this anime, I tried watching it three times, but I cease here. This anime is simply not for me. If I were to summarize it in one word, I'd have to use the word 'childish'.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero is a show as confident in its storytelling as it is confused in its aims. After many tries, I've filed it away still unable to describe what point Urobuchi is trying to make with this. The closest I've come is that it's a condemnation of idealism, but this is only weakly supported by the text, and I suspect that impression is more a function of it being a prequel to a visual novel that thoroughly affirms the great moral significance of ideals. In that light, Fate/Zero's grim, cynical ending merely serves a narrative purpose. This doesn't make it unwatchable or even bad, but itdoes make it a fairly predictable addition to the Fate continuity\u2014if you've read Fate/stay night, this will be exactly what you expect it to be and not much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nStill, that isn't to say that Fate/Zero is boring. The art and animation are sharp and precise, Urobuchi's excellent storytelling makes Fate/Zero as thrilling as anything Code Geass has to offer. The characters, themes, and mood of Fate/stay night are flawlessly transferred to this show; Kotomine remains among the best antagonists I've ever seen in a genre show, and Kiritsugu's backstory does him justice, bringing to life that strange, cold silhouette hanging over Shirou's every action in the VN. Urobuchi's Saber is somewhat one-dimensional\u2014though there are certainly less attractive sides to the character than the whole honorable knight routine\u2014but then it isn't really her story. It's also tough to complain when she receives such a heartbreaking character moment at the end of the show, dragging her down to the nadir she needs to be mired in to set up her for Fate/stay night. Without giving away too much, it's a deeply affecting portrayal of Saber's lowest ebb, anticipating the sequel in which she is finally rewarded for her martyrdom, for all the years that she shouldered the shame and sin of her people in the name of justice and honor. Nonetheless, you'd be forgiven for thinking that she's little more than a gender-swapped Lancer after watching this.\\n\\n\r\nI suspect the problem with Fate/Zero is that Urobuchi does not write characters in the same way that Nasu does and there's an odd disconnect there. This wasn't an issue in Madoka because it was purely an Urobuchi creation, but it hurts Fate/Zero simply because Fate/stay night, for all its many faults, had some extremely distinctive character writing. Whenever Kotomine or Kiritsugu are onscreen, this show comes to life. Kotomine is a devilish twist on the fairly played-out some-men-just-want-to-watch-the-world-burn Joker-type villain in that he's wracked with confusion and contradiction\u2014a man who became a priest just to avoid confronting his darkest impulses. Watching him come to terms with himself over the course of Fate/Zero is absolutely thrilling. Some of his dialogue with Gilgamesh might be a little on-the-nose, but the tendency to tell rather than show is a trait Urobuchi shares with Nasu, and it doesn't detract from the intrigue. Unfortunately, the new characters, as well as those without any backstory established for them in Fate/stay night, are all exceptionally dull and predictable by comparison. Kariya is a character with plenty of potential that was entirely squandered; the same goes for Tokiomi and Aoi, whose stories only affected me because of my familiarity with Rin and Sakura and the legacy left for them. Kayneth and Sola-Ui are indescribably bland villains\u2014so bland that Urobuchi apparently didn't even bother to resolve their storyline with Lancer. \\n\\n\r\nI'm darting around the main point here, though; these plot devices masquerading as characters are nothing compared to this show's attempt to introduce a pair of legitimately developed characters in Rider and Waver. These two are almost entirely superfluous besides their involvement in plot development\u2014especially Waver\u2014and are by turns irritating, predictable, or both. Urobuchi is not a very funny writer, and though there's nothing on the level of Madoka's \"girls shouldn't like girls\" gag, Rider and Waver's painful attempts at lightening the mood in the early episodes of the show come off as dull and obvious. The show starts taking them more seriously later on, but this doesn't improve things, as I'm fairly sure that they have the same conversation about twenty times\u2014Waver's inferiority complex acts up, Rider makes some gruff, paternal gesture to stop his navel-gazing and cheer him up, and they ride off on their chariot. The principal problem is that Waver's arc is damnably obvious. The first time you see him, you just know that he's going to end up finding the respect he wants by entering the Grail War and stepping up to the challenges it presents. That's exactly what happens, and though that might be forgivable if that story was told in a way that you don't expect, it just isn't. The ponderous tone of the Fate universe means that we spend a painstakingly long time listening to these two repeat themselves, so if you hadn't figured out where Waver's character was headed after the first few scenes with him and Rider, don't worry\u2014you'll get a hundred more opportunities to witness this shallow development again and again. Waver's story has no particular thematic congruence with the rest of Fate, nor a deep connection with the other characters. At this stage, he's just some kid, and the focus on him dilutes Fate/Zero far too much.\\n\\n\r\nRider is significantly better, though he still comes off as a little superfluous thanks to his interactions with Waver, and never really ascends beyond the level of archetype despite some interesting backstory. He's an obvious foil to Saber, a Nietzschean font of vitality living selflessly by living selfishly, indulging in his passions and laughing all the way to Valhalla. In other words, he's Gilgamesh, Saber's preexisting foil, without the potent streak of nihilism that made Gilgamesh that much more unpredictable. Rider justifies his behaviour through a belief in master morality and rational self-interest; Gilgamesh doesn't even think such things are worth justifying, and that's what makes him the more interesting character. To give Rider his due, the idea of a journey to seek out an impossible ideal\u2014his principal motivation\u2014has some thematic weight in the broader context of the Fate universe, but there's no real point to him as he relates to the other characters. There is one thing that he contributes to the dialogue: his beliefs mean that he can challenge Saber on her principles, while Gilgamesh is devoid of principles in the first place. It would simply be out-of-character for Gilgamesh to question Saber. Gilgamesh sees the tragic beauty of Saber's condition without necessarily endorsing or dismissing it\u2014he merely beholds it as it is, caring only if it serves his own interests. Still, with the emergence of plot developments at the end of Fate/Zero that throw Saber into despair and self-doubt, it's questionable whether Rider even needed to challenge her, especially when she already has Kiritsugu's cold utilitarianism to contend with. The overarching problem remains that the dialogue about idealism was already set up by Fate/stay night and Fate/Zero largely just mimics it. The addition of Rider to that dialogue seems like an afterthought.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the matter of Caster and Ryuunosuke, who are either deployed to meet Fate/Zero's edgy grimdark quota or played for laughs; it might not surprise you that I didn't partake in any. That said, they are far more interesting antagonists than Kayneth and his phoned-in villainous arrogance, and I appreciated Caster mistaking Saber for Joan of Arc\u2014quite a clever and appropriate little touch\u2014but in many scenes, they're merely buffoonish and pad out the show even further. In a universe so concerned with little details and thematic cohesion, characters ought not to be playing such shallow roles.\\n\\n\r\nThe best episodes of Fate/Zero are the ones that cut out the fluff; Kiritsugu's backstory, told over the course of two episodes, is particularly good\u2014revealing any of it would spoil it, even if you've read Fate/stay night. It's baffling that Urobuchi is so very good when he's dealing with someone else's characters, but is incapable of introducing any new character here whose purpose and relevance I can fully describe beyond their role in the plot\u2014Rider is the lone exception, and even with him, it's pretty shaky. There is, however, one episode of Fate/Zero that is definitely superfluous, and yet I can't help but enjoy it. That episode is Rin's Adventure, a sweet little diversion around midway through the show that focuses on one of Fate/stay night's best characters, Tohsaka Rin. In Fate/Zero, she's still an elementary schooler, and it's a real treat to see here the beginnings of the sharp-tongued, reluctant heroine she would become.\\n\\n\r\nIdeally, one would read Fate/stay night before watching this, but for those unwilling to slog through a visual novel, this is better directed and more accessible than Studio DEEN's Fate/stay night. It's good rather than great, but it's entertaining above all. If you like tight plotting, high production values, and men talking in dark, earnest tones, this is worth a watch.",

            "content": "I have been waiting for this for so long, my wish finally granted by the Golden studios ufotable! It\u2019s not every day that a Type-Moon fangirl like me (who has to yearn for VN & light novel translations to keep her company) gets such a treat. After finally getting a closure on Kara no Kyoukai after reading the light novels, Carnival Phantasm and Fate/Zero were the beacons I wanted to grasp. I say, forget the Fate/stay night anime right now, srsly right now! DEEN simply raped it badly and the VN\u2019s epicness was never captured but if you\u2019ve seen it, at least it gives youenough information about the characters that you are seeing in a new light in this two-cour series. \\n\\n\r\nThis comes from a God studio ufotable, who had done such a brilliant job on Kara no Kyoukai. If you've read the novels and seen the movies, you already know they really worked on being faithful to the original material. In this case Urobuchi's words and nasuverse character come alive on screen and complimented by not only production quality but hours and hours of work done on it. Even if you have not seen Fate/stay night or played the VNs, don't fret, this is a brilliant series to get into nasuverse and Type-Moon goodness. Being an expert, I guarantee you that you'll never regret it. \\n\\n\r\nI'm writing this review just after episode one but seriously THIS is what you call an awesome start or as Chaos Neco Arc would say, Hajimari, yo~ The around 48minute run of this episode was ideal for introducing all the Holy Grail jargon along with the first take on all the masters. Sure, not everyone was given the limelight as Caster\u2019s master Ryuunosuke is still MIA but that would come in the next episode for sure. The finished product in terms of first episode was nothing short of brilliant. It\u2019s not every day that you see HD quality animation on a series. In movies, sure! But in a two-cour series like this; is definitely one of the firsts. It\u2019s a treat for the sore eyes and looks brilliant even on low quality stream. BGM by Yuki Kajiura is spine tingling sometimes and I recommend to use quality headphones for this one because while the scenes play; from the sound of wind blowing to even flicker of candles, dialogue quality and BGM placement all enhances the viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character is voiced perfectly and from being an arrogant bastards to cute lolis, this has everything that you might be looking forward to. Also, there are so many badass men! Sure, Saber rocks and including her delivery of \u201cAnata ga watashi o Master ka?\u201d but man! Kiritsugu and Kirei are something else; especially Kiritsugu and his guns and his smoke. Yep, lots of gun and smoke porn on this one\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, from the looks of things and the summoned servants, this series is going to be full of schemes, conspiracies and back stabbing with the right dash of drama and romance. Kirei and Kirutsugu are going to play very strong roles in shaping up the plot and even if they are opposites in terms of values, they share more similarities than any other master. So, keep watching this for awesome development and even bet calls on who dies first because after all, this will be a cutthroat deluxe with winner taking all the glory and supremacy. \\n\\n\r\nSo, quickly:\\n\r\nStory - scheming, conspiracies, war and spine-tingling action. What more can a watcher ask for?\\n\r\nArt - Simply beautiful, just look at those detailed backgrounds!\\n\r\nSound - Yuki Kajiura, do I have to say anything else?\\n\r\nCharacters - Many and far between, yet you will end up remembering everyone and even side with some to their twisted motives to glory.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Brilliant. I want my fill of mystery and action, shaken and stirred.\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10 and this might actually increase while the series continues. I'm blogging this series on Metanorn so you can drop by to fangirl/boy anytime.",

            "content": "In almost all forms of media, spinoffs, sequels, and prequels all have one thing in common. They are a crap shoot. Most of the time these spinoffs suck. Fortunately in anime, that is not always the case. In fact there are several times where I find myself enjoy the sequel/ prequel better than the original. However this anime is true rarity, in which the prequel just about outdoes the original in virtually every aspect. This review focuses solely on the first season of fate/zero. I'll write a separate review for season 2. \r\n___________________________________________\r\nO.K. here is the actual review with my IADb rating system:\r\nStory:  FateZero takes place ten years before the events of Fate/stay night, and Chronicles the 4th Holy Grail War. The whole grail war consists of seven teams, with each team consisting of a master and a servant. These servants are heroic spirits that fight each other to the death, with the last servant standing winning the power for him and his master to make any type of wish on the holy grail. After failing to win the grail three times in a row, The Einzbern family have elected to bring the hated magus murderer, Kiritsugu Emiya (who is also the father of the main protagonist in Fate/ Stay Night), into their ranks and compete for the grail. When Emiya ultimately summons Saber as his servant, the two form one of the most unique relationships that I have ever seen. One of the primary things you watched fate/ stay night for was the battles, and while the battles are great here, it is the unforgettable dialogue that drives the anime home.\\n\\n\r\nThe Battles: While the dialogue is amazing, fate zero is part of the fate franchise, and hence the battles are a must see. What makes these fights so interesting though is the dialogue that goes on in them.  Unlike fate/ stay night, where to many extents you were presented with a typical shounen fight, you get so much more here. You really do learn the back story of every combat tent and are forced to pick sides. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: There are over 7000 animes on this website. I have seen almost 500 of them and will be reviewing all of them this year. Out of those 500 animes, the cast in this anime ranks 4th, with the only 3 having a better cast being Steins Gate, rainbow nisha rokubou no shichinin, and full metal alchemist brotherhood.  Virtually every master and every servant here plays its part perfectly. You have rider, the fan favorite who is just epic. (yes i just said \"epic\"). You have caster, the child murdering servant who couldn't give two sh*ts about the grail war. Than there is saber, one of the greatest female characters of all time. Archer is a great villain, but slightly over powered. Lancer proved himself to be a formidable opponent for Saber.\\n\\n\r\nArt: When i review the 2nd season this section will pretty much be a carbon copy. Fate/ Zero quite simply has the best animation that I have ever scene. It is just mind blowing how beautiful and life like everything looks. Ufotable knows how to produce a beautiful anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: All of the voice actors sound their age. All of the background music is perfectly used. The opening is great and the ending is one of the best in anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While the first episode is a complete info dump, and while there is technically no climax to this season as the finale is a regular episode that ends with \"to be continued in April,\" every other episode in this series left me baffled with amazement. Yes there are some flaws, and yes I can safely say that in the three month span between season1 and season 2, those flaws are seemingly eliminated, Fate/ Zero Season one is definitely an anime to watch.\\n\r\n____________________________________________\\n\r\nThe IADb official scoring:\\n\\n\r\nPlot, Sequence, Flow: 2.6/3 Points\\n\r\nOverall Characters: 1.6/2 Points\\n\r\nVisual Effects: 2/2 Points\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 0.8/1 Point\\n\r\nEnjoyment/ Lust to watch the next episode: 1.6/2 Point\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________________________\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 8.6\\n\r\nNY Grade: B+\\n",

            "content": "I am one of the many who walked into Fate/Zero with no prior knowledge of the Fate franchise, so when I watched the super long exposition/info dump that was this show's first episode a couple years ago, I was skeptical of whether or not I should have continued. I'm very, very glad that I chose to continue. \r\nFate/Zero is the prequel to Fate/Stay Night, written by Gen Urobuchi who is well known for his use of dark and mature atmosphere in his writing. This darkness and maturity is in full swing in Fate/Zero. This series is chock-full of plot twists, engaging dialogues, moral ambiguity, andmany other elements of a serious story. The recurring themes of morality, honor and chivalry on the battlefield, along with the constant clashing of ideologies between the show's fairly large cast make for a story with a lot of depth and drive. \\n\\n\r\nIt isn't perfect, though. No story is, unfortunately. I felt that the plot dragged on or felt slow at times. There were dialogues that I think, while engaging, had gone on too long, but this isn't a huge problem when you look at the big picture. Lots of people say that the ending was anticlimactic, and they're kind of right, but I think these people forget that Fate/Zero is a prequel. No matter how much you may want a grand and epic finale to a grand and epic show, if that show is only the precursor to another show, it's got to find a way to set up for what comes up next.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are arguably both the best and worst things in the show. \\n\\n\r\nI don't think I have ever come by a show where every single character receives proper attention and has depth. Does this show accomplish that? No, but I think it puts in a good effort. All fourteen of the main characters are unique, and each come with their own ideologies, motivations, and reasons for participating in the Holy Grail War. The viewer, rather than being treated to the usual good versus evil setup where a hero fights a villain in order to save the world like we've seen a million times before, gets a glimpse at each of the characters' motivations and their ideological outlooks. The characters all have a place on the good-evil scale, but none are truly righteous, and none are truly malevolent. This bit of moral ambiguity serves to make the characters a lot more realistic and less like fairy tale heroes--which ironically a lot of the characters happen to be.\\n\\n\r\nThis show isn't afraid to kill off its characters. There is no such thing as plot armor in Fate/Zero, and this is perhaps because Fate/Zero is devoid of any one true \"main\" character, at least not until the end. That's kind of the beauty of this series, though. You can have a perfectly created character with motivations, ethics, a good backstory, and all that other good stuff a character needs, but Fate/Zero doesn't give a hoot about that. If it means the plot will progress, then that character will die. If you're used to shows where characters are saved by writers pulling deus ex machina events out of their asses with contrived reasons like \"the power of friendship\" or \"the power of love,\" then Fate/Zero isn't the story for you.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the criticisms. I love the cast of Fate/Zero. I love the uniqueness and maturity of the characters. It's great, really. My gripe with the characters is that we can see quite obviously that they have depth, but we don't get to delve into said depths with the exception of maybe one or two characters. Here we are presented fourteen potentially amazing characters. They all have backstories, and half of them are ancient heroes (or villains) of legend. I sure as hell would have been a lot more invested in the characters if the show had gone deeper into some of their mythologies. It would have made certain aspects of the show feel much more meaningful, and I think it would have given some events more impact. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great, don't get me wrong, but even having said that, they could have been so much more.\\n\\n\r\nMy words aren't adequate for the task of describing how PERFECT this show's art is. Watch it yourself.\\n\\n\r\nJust kidding. I'll try to the best of my ability to capture the art in words.\\n\\n\r\nThe color palette is very dark, grey and unsaturated, which is fitting for the show. The animation is fluent, from the movements of fighting characters, to smoke coming out of an exhaust pipe. Speaking of the movements of characters, I'd like to point out that every character has their own way of carrying themselves, and I don't just mean in the way that they pose when they stand. They all have their own distinct way of moving, which shows how much the artists want to emphasize that these characters are unique. The use of gradients in coloration was a smart move by Ufotable, as it gives off a great effect of shading. Objects look almost three dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is done by Yuki Kajiura, and her orchestrations fit this show perfectly. There are tracks that get you hyped for a fight, and there are tracks that make you feel a character's sadness. The voice acting is great as well, at least for the Japanese dub. I haven't heard the English dub. The OPs for both seasons are good. I regret to say that I never really sat through the end of an episode to listen to the EDs, with the exception of a few episodes where the ED was different.\\n\\n\r\nDoes the plot lag at times? Yes. Do I see what they did to save animation budget? Yes. Could we have gotten more elaborate with the characters? Yes. Does that make Fate/Zero any less of an epic experience? Hell no. Fate/Zero is part of a dying breed of anime. The industry is slowly turning into a money grabbing competition, and there are fewer and fewer shows that are willing to give viewers an amazing experience, and there are more and more shows appearing that are selling tons because of a pair of tits flopping around on screen. I'm not saying that shows that pander to otakus are bad, I'm saying that I don't want them to be the only thing available. Fate/Zero didn't fail to deliver anything to its viewers. It's a personal favorite of mine, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\n+Interesting characters\\n\r\n+Moral ambiguity makes for a less black and white experience\\n\r\n+Visually gorgeous\\n\r\n+Soundtrack is great\\n\r\n+Engaging and thought-provoking dialogues\\n\r\n+Heavy themes are explored well\\n\r\n(+/-)Nihilistic\\n\r\n(+/-)Would have been better as a standalone series\\n\r\n-Plot lags at times\\n\r\n-Characters could have been explored more\\n\r\n-Ending might be seen as anticlimactic\\n\r\n-First episode is an info dump that could have been handled a lot better\\n\r\n-Little to no world building",

            "content": "Where do I begin with Fate/Zero? The first time I watched this series (roughly two years ago) I, admittedly, adored it. However, I recently rewatched it after reading the Fate/Stay Night light novel. It was then that my opinion of the seriess dropped substantially. Don't worry! This won't be a review where I bitch about how Fate/Zero messed up the characters that had been lovingly crafted in Fate/Stay Night! Indeed, I will try my best not to mention that wonderful novel (and godawful fanbase) and will instead focus on analyzing the content at hand. There will, however, be MILD SPOILERS. Consider yourself warned.The key problem with Fate/Zero is, in my mind, its characters, if you can call them that. When it comes to Urobuchi (the writer behind Psycho Pass, Madoka Magica, this, and some other stuff that nobody cares about), the main thing most critics complain about is the lack of good characterization. Urobuchi himself has admitted that when it comes to writing characters, the only way he knows how to develop them is to make them go insane. As a result, most of Urobuchi's characters have a tendency to come across as just tools of the writer rather than actual people. And yet, when it comes to Fate/Zero, the characters are often times given a free pass. The reason behind this is obvious, many of the characters that are present in Fate/Zero were also present Fate/Stay Night (don't worry, I'll talk about Rider and Waver later) and because of this, older watchers have a very positive knee-jerk reaction despte the fact that the characters in question aren't being written very well.\\n\r\nLet's start with the inexplicably popular protagonist of the series, Kiritsugu. Everyone's favorite edgelord. And that's exactly what he is, an edgelord. Kiritsugu is the gritty, badass, nigh-immoral hero who believes that the ends (saving as many people as possible) always justify the means (killing, backstabbinig, etc.). But he has a tragic backstory, is truly a nice person on the inside, and in the end he fully realizes the error of his ways and that by saving one person, he can save himself. And... thats about it. Thats all there is to the hero of this story. He has no funny quirks, no interesting personality traits that make him unique, no sideplots that make him seem more human (unless if you count the robotic and mildly creepy romance that he had going on with Irisviel or the wasted, near meaningless, and still somewhat creepy romance with Maiya). He isn't even a particularly well-developed character. All of his character development happens within the final two episodes of the series, and his entire backstory gets dropped over the course of two episodes 2/3 of the way through the series. Other than his typical stoic badass attitude and capabilities, nothing about Kiritsugu makes him likeable or unique. He's literally Homura.\\n\r\n    But what about the side characters? Kariya and Kirei are both good (they fall under Urobuchi's strong point: characters who develop via falling into darkness), but thats about it. Nobody gives a crap about Kayneth or Tokiomi, so I won't mention them. They're completely forgettable. Saber and Gilgamesh are both bland caricatures of what they were in Fate/Stay Night. In this, Gilgamesh's ego seems more like a funny quirk than a defining character trait established by a lifetime of unchallenged supremacy (Fate/Stay Night Gil would never have lost his shit over something as petty as being forced to stand on the same ground as somebody else, nor would he have literally rode Iskander's dick the way he did after Iskander failed. Shirou and Broserker both did one hundred times better than Iskander, and barely got acknowledged). And of course, Urobuchi makes sure to punish Saber for being an honorable person at every possible oppurtunity, even if it means changing the character in order to do so. A good example of this would be the King's Banquet scene, where Saber practically shits herself after Iskander says that she isn't a king because she didn't rule over her people like a tyrant. Now I'm no Seiba-fanboy (I now hate myself for having used that spelling) but the girl's never struck me as stupid. She should have been more than capable of defending herself against Iskander's reasoning, which was quite honestly retarded.\\n\r\n   And now we come to Iskander and Waver, the most popular yaoi couple in the anime. Waver isn't much to talk about, pretty much just your standard little-bitch-comes-of-age story. Iskander, on the other hand, is a selfish, two-dimensional Gary Stu prick who recieves hardly any development throughout the series, yet gets praised for his charisma and manliness. The problem with Iskander is that he is essentially the pet of Urobuchi in the story. He's always in the right (even when he's not), and is given lip-service by characters who would normally never do so (did I mention that Gilgamesh, who was originially one of the characterically egotistical characters in the history of anime, rides his dick to the moon?). It should be noted that Iskander's policy for kingship is essentially \"REAL LEADERS KNOW THAT LETTING YOUR PEOPLE KILL EACHOTHER IS OKAY BECAUSE IT MEANS YOU HAVE RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUALITY! FUCK THE PEOPLE, KINGS DO WHAT THEY WANT! THAT'S WHAT REAL LEADERSHIP IS!!\", and yet all the edgelords and sheep watching (and Urobuchi if the plot is any indicator) praise him for how badass and manly he is. What a joke of a character.\\n\r\n   As for the story? Its fine, though it suffers from the same problems that all stories with wish granting  magical plot devices suffer from (if you've seen Madoka Magica, you know what I'm talking about). The beginning sort of sucks, as the first two episodes are essentially a massive infodump. Obviously, it would have been better if that info had been dropped at a steadier rate throughout the series. And then there is the jarring two-episode flashback that I mentioned before, but other than that the plot is pretty good.\\n\r\n   Art? Sound? Its Ufotable. Next?\\n\r\n   All in all, Fate/Zero is a far more enjoyable series than I made it out to be in this review. I focused more on the negatives because practically everyone out there knows the positives. Its a well produced action anime with a good plot and an interesting fantasy element yet mostly boring or irritating characters (except for Kotomine-Goddamn-Badass-Get-Hyped-for-Heaven's-Feel-Greatness-Kirei). Overall, the series deserves 6.5-7. Oh, wait, Ilyasviel doesn't play a major role in this series? For that alone, I'm taking a point off!",

As one might assume that Fate/Zero is your generic shounen or action anime, this is indeed very far from being true. As the series tells the experiences of the participants in the Holy Grail War, the differences between Fate/Stay and Fate/Zero are very prevalent right from the word go as the anime starts. Depicting a much darker setting and tone as well as its far more mature story than its predecessors, Fate/Zero hits on many elements which make a great anime.\r\nThrough a variety of different plot features such as the loreof the Holy Grail Wars and the descriptive character development of each participant the story is able to convey its entity. Expressive language is shown through the communications between characters and the endeavours which they encounter in their survival quest. Emotive story techniques such as the continuous backbone of drama and emotional strain on the characters are put in effect as the director Aoki, Ei was wanting to develop these features of the anime, through identification of these key ideas the story is enhanced and is able to engage the viewer into the anime's plot and world. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime Fate/Zero features contemporary modern anime art styles which are commonly seen in newer anime. As Fate/Zero is a 2011 production, one might assume that it has a lower quality of art to any of the newer 2013 anime, this is far from true. As the art is able to express the surroundings of the anime and is used as a tool to convince the viewer of a situation or characters identity, it makes it likeable and relate-able. The dark and colourful features help the viewer to feel a sense of connection to the characters as they are aesthetically pleasing to see when shown in their fantasy action battle scenes and calm intellectual conversations. The land scape and settings of the anime are also able to bring forth the same connections the viewer has.\\n\\n\r\nSound plays a large role in Fate/Zero and is also executed exceptionally well. Through the use of diegetic and non-diegetic sound the characters are brought to life as the soundtrack features many western style music tracks which help the viewer identify with the anime as well as once again, form connections to the characters, world and assist in the viewer feel engaged while watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters and specifically the protagonists in Fate/Zero are metaphorically crossing into a 'new world' as they advance through the story. They are able to break 'barriers' which determine whether they are capable of having a sense of belonging to their world and with each other as well as being able to stay alive in the anime's game-like survival environment and setting. It is worth mentioning that the characters are of a video-game type as they are classed into \"Archer, Lancer, Rider, Caster, Berserker and Assassin.\" This may create a reminiscent feeling for many viewers as they could relate to these roles as like in some MMORPGs. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is able to ad-hear to many aspects of what would make an enjoyable anime for its own genres. Fate/Zero successfully is able to make the viewer develop a sense of attachment and connection with the characters, plot and world as you are pulled through an adventure of survival and heroism. This anime is enjoyable if you are seeking an intelligent 'action, supernatural, fantasy, drama' with a developed story driven plot, likeable interesting characters and intellectual language techniques and engaging supernatural battles.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW OF BOTH SEASONS (NOT FATE/STAY NIGHT)**\r\n\"Say that humanity has been narrowed down to merely 500 people. 300 of them are packed onto one ship, 200 are on another, sailing toward an irrelevant destination. Suddenly, both ships suffer massive structural damage simultaneously and begin to sink; you are the only one who can repair them. However, there is only time to repair one ship: What do you do?\"\r\n\"The answer is simple. Repair the ship with 300 people.\"\r\n\"Suppose that upon learning this, the ship of 200 people captures you and demands that you fix their ship first. Now what do you do?\"\r\n\"...Kill all 200.\"\r\nTheconcept of sacrifice is something that anyone who has watched the masterpiece that is Fate/Zero is all too familiar with. From interesting, complex characters, to an intriguing story-line, to stellar animation, there are very few things to NOT like about this anime. For those of you unfamiliar with the Fate series, here is a short synopsis:\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night is an anime that is part of the same series as Fate/Zero and was released years before Fate/Zero, but Fate/Zero (which was made by a completely different studio and has a completely different writer) is a prequel and chronologically comes 10 years before the events of Fate/Stay Night (BTW, DON'T watch Fate/Stay Night. It sucks, and the same studio that made Fate/Zero has announced it is remaking it, so wait for the remake).\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night may be garbage in my opinion, but that only makes the fact that Fate/Zero is stunningly good all the more impressive. It likely would have gotten 10/10 if it didn't have to carry the dead weight of its retarded older brother.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nA pretty straightforward story. It's another \"death game\" type show: 7 \"masters\" (who are highly skilled mages) summon 7 \"servants\" (who are legendary epic heroes or historical figures) and fight to the death for possession of the Holy Grail; the artifact that is said to grant any wish. \\n\r\nNot only does Fate/Zero have an excellent concept, but it has nearly flawless execution. While Fate/Stay Night spent time trying to develop their horribly written characters rather then focus on the plot , Fate/Zero shows them how it's done by creating a much darker, suspenseful, and convincing environment. Part of what makes it work so well is that (again) unlike Fate/Stay Night, there is no single protagonist, and therefore no clear winner to the war. The viewer is legitimately kept unsure of what is going to happen next, and more importantly: who is going to win. Essentially every character is major and you will develop some sort of emotional attachment to them. You will love the characters you are supposed to love, hate the characters you are supposed to hate, fear the characters you are supposed to fear, and be left to form your own opinions about the characters with controversial motives. There are loads of massively entertaining plot developments,fantastic writing decisions, and there are a couple epic plot twists.\\n\r\nThe only real complaint I have about the story and the reason I can't give it 10/10 isn't really Fate/Zero's fault in the first place: it's Fate/Stay Night's. The first episode of Fate/Zero is an hour long as opposed to the normal 20-25 minute length, and it is NOTHING but exposition. Fate/Zero is forced to basically summarize everything relevant to the plot in it's first two or three episodes that Fate/Stay Night took 24 episodes to explain. If you watch Fate/Zero and didn't watch it's predecessor, you better pay attention to the first episodes pretty damn carefully, because you won't believe how fast they blow by backstory! Once they finish the exposition and get to the real plot though, it is absolutely fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nStellar, absolutely breathtaking animation. The style perfectly compliments both the dark and light portions of the anime. I don't give 10/10 art ratings lightly, but Fate/Zero knocked it out of the park.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nGreat openings (especially the 2nd one), good endings, and an EPIC soundtrack that goes along with the fast-paced action atmosphere excellently. Great voice acting in both the dub and sub. No complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nI am still marveling at how masterfully these characters were written. There are WAY too many major and significant characters to bother trying to get to them all in a review. Nothing I say here will do these characters justice, but I'll do my best:\\n\r\nNearly single character is complex, has his/her own specific morals and desires, and has a distinctive/recognizable personality. Saying that alone doesn't mean much to someone who hasn't seen the show, but consider that there are 7 masters, 7 servants, and several side characters on top of that! From the sympathy and despair you feel for Kirisugu Emiya, to the heart-warming, lovable Rider, to the sheer badassness of Kirei Kotomine, to the intoxicating pride of Archer, to the tragedy of Kariya Moto; I could go on forever. Masterful masterful masterful masterful MASTERFUL characters. I couldn't even hazard to pick my favorite one, because there are so many greats. You'll have to take my word on this one; best character development for such a huge cast of characters I've ever seen. Fate/Zero really did the impossible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThe over-saturation of exposition in the beginning is the only real reason Fate/Zero falls short of a 10/10, and because it's a prequel to an anime the studio had nothing to do with, even that isn't really its fault. Fate/Zero is a dark, compelling tragedy filled with constant suspense, unparalleled character development, fantastic writing, and top of the line animation. Fate/Zero is not only entertaining, it is a thought provoking masterpiece that really sets new standard for what a thriller anime should be like. If you are planning on watching the Fate series (which I highly recommend), my recommendation is to watch Fate/Zero and then wait for the remake of Fate/Stay Night (which has already been announced), because the current version of Fate/Stay Night is just humiliatingly bad, particularly if you watch Fate/Zero first and expect a decent continuation.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero was the very first experience I had with the Fate franchise by Type Moon; I never played/read the Visual Novels/Light Novels nor watched anything Fate/Stay Night or Fate/Kaleid related before, so I\u2019m not going to make endless comparisons to any other things Fate related. Just to make that clear. Also, this review covers both seasons for convenience.\r\nTo be honest, Fate/Zero's premise sounded rather cheesy to me at first. But I'll promise you, the execution is fantastic, thrilling, and mature. That ranges from the fantastic visuals to the excellent soundtrack, the interesting and intriguing characters, their dialogues, as well as to the very well realizedfight scenes in between.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set place in an alternate reality, in which Magis (mages) exist, magic can be studied and used to bring back old heroic personalities from across the history, such as King Arthur or Alexander the Great, to fight in a battle royal to the death with the goal of obtaining the \"omnipotent-wish granting device\" called the \"Holy Grail\", said to grant one miracle to the winner of said battle royal. This battle is called \"The Holy Grail War\" and takes place in Fuyuki City every 60 years. Seven Mages (\u201cMasters\u201d) are chosen, and each of them get a Servant to join the fight. These Servants are separated into seven different classes; Saber, Archer, Lancer, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. Each Servant is, as already mentioned, a Heroic Spirit from the history books, brought back to life to fight for honor and the power, which the Holy Grail supposedly possesses. After three failed attempts, the 4th Holy Grail War takes place and that's where the story of Fate/Zero begins.\\n\\n\r\nThe backstory of the Fate series is huge and could literally fill books. The very first episode plays it nice and safe for everyone not familiar with the franchise and takes a 50 minute long, almost exposition dump, on you, explaining some important details about the history of the war, the main families involved in it, their connections and so on. We also get introduced to the several different Mages and get a small glimpse of what they are fighting for. While I agree that it was necessary to understand what the hell is going on, it also was one of the less entertaining parts of the show, but I personally didn't have a problem with that. I'd rather \u201csuffer\u201d a huge info dump instead of having to scratch my head at everything that's happening during the show any time. The story of the show flows pretty well actually and the balance between lengthy dialogues and impressive battles was handled really nicely. The cliffhanger at the end of the season was really nasty though. I still don't see why this was split into two halves anyways\u2026\\n\\n\r\nEach Servant gets a different Master of course, and each Master has different reasons to participate in this battle alongside different tactics to win it. Some are playing it out honorable in a traditional fashion and others are going on rampages with their new best friends because they can and feel like it. That makes every one of the different characters never feel really dull and especially as the cast of characters mostly consists only of fully grown adults (meaning no high school-girls, tsunderes, no token lolis and so on) very refreshing and it also includes no random fan service to ruin the otherwise serious and dark mood of the show. Fate/Zero is a mature anime but it can seem a bit \u201cedgy\u201d sometimes, especially as one Master is a psycho who loves to torture and kill children with his new Servant and said Master doesn't really get much explanation for his behavior, other than \"It's art and so coooooool!\". The characters are a mixed bag; on one hand some are intriguing and on the other hand some were barely fleshed out or just contribute nothing to the main story then sitting around and talking. I\u2019m looking at you, Tokiomi! But my overall impression of the characters was genuinely positive though and I rooted for a lot of them. They weren't perfect though and tend to act stupid at times, but nothing that would make me upset or dock a lot of points for.\\n\\n\r\nSo with being a battle royal in its core you might think that it's quite obvious who is the winner because there is a main character and everything, but it's really not. Yes, there are some characters that get (a lot) more screen time and dialogue than others, but among the main ones it's always a struggle because every Servant and Master has different strengths and weaknesses and especially one fight between two Servants in the early parts of the show was really gripping to watch. But sadly, most battles between Servants boil down to dialogues and speeches about honor and chivalry and it makes the characters appear a bit dumb at times, when they let the enemy get away for like the 10th time instead of just finishing them off. It may be necessary for the continuation of the plot, but as a viewer it wasn't that enjoyable all the time and I sometimes ended up shaking my head. But some fights between the Masters and their use of magic and weapons are where shit really hits the fan. You really feel the difference when watching the Masters and Servants fight. The Masters act a bit more realistic and out to really win the war and have their wish granted, while the Servants mostly fight in and for their honor. It makes a real nice change of pace to see the Heroic Spirits fight one another in a duel like fashion and the Masters fighting one another like it was an extermination, so the action doesn't get old fast and some Master/Servant combos even have a clash of ideologies sometimes as they don't agree on their methods used in the war. It was really interesting to watch how some relationships between Master and Servant didn't bloom perfectly but were also spread with doubt and hatred for each other. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of relationships between Master and Servant... What also spiced the whole thing up more were these different interactions between some Masters and their Servants. Especially the duo of Waver and Rider made for two solid developed and likeable characters, the same goes for Irisviel and Saber. Sadly that\u2019s not true for all of them; those two groups definitely took the cake in this first season for me. Another honorable mention goes to Archer helping Kotomine Kirei to develop as a character and changing his view on the whole situation he is in. While their interactions mostly consisted of talking and can be boring for some, I found them to be interesting and necessary to get a better view on the character of Kirei, who starts of as a pawn by Tokiomi but becomes a strong and more confident stand-alone character later on. But the character interactions didn\u2019t just consist of the Master and Servants, but dialogues and discussions between some multiple Servants as well. They also get to talk with each other, share their thoughts and ideals \u2013 and not always for the better. For some people Fate/Zero may be too much talking and too less fighting and I would agree with those to an extent. But all in all I was pleasantly surprised with the aforementioned balance between dialogues and crossing swords this show has to offer, especially since the pacing in Season 1 is a slow, steady build-up, only to have it all tumbling down in Season 2. It was a worthy pay-off and I really loved the ending, though some scenes might confuse people not familiar with anything else Fate related.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing which made this already well executed story even more stand-out was the great animation done by ufotable, which most notable works include the famous Kara no Kyoukai - The Garden of Sinners movie series. Everyone who saw their films know how they make an anime appealing and exciting, this is also helped by the excellent visual and sound direction the show has. The art is detailed; the animation smooth and fluent, the use of lighting and shadows brilliant and even the obligatory ufotable 3DCG looks really good. The quality got even stepped up in Season 2 and it looks even more impressive. Truly a sight to behold.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was made by Yuki Kajiura and if you already listened to a soundtrack done by her, you know how most of her music sounds; epic choirs, orchestra and so on - Fate/Zero is no exception. At some points I could have sworn I was listening to a Madoka Magica or Kara no Kyoukai OST instead, they really sound that familiar. While that's a good thing to those fond of her style of music, it's also off putting for those, who don't like the \u201ctypical Kajiura flair\u201d that much. I personally like her style and tracks like \"Point Zero\", \"the beginning of the end\", \"fate to zero\", \"this day, and never again\" or \"The Battle is to the Strong\" made a lasting impression on me and got into my favorites on iTunes. The rest of the audio design is fantastic as well, with good sound effects and the voice actors did a solid job as well. They really made the characters feel alive. I can't speak for the English dub, but the German dub was slightly above average. To all German speaking readers: Stick to the subs please, it\u2019s not worth the money. All in all Fate/Zero is one of the best looking and sounding anime I had the pleasure with yet, it was a feast for my eyes and ears in 1080p Blu-Ray quality. It was a great experience to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nLet's get to the verdict of Fate/Zero:\\n\\n\r\nI really had a good time with this show, I like it a lot. But as much as I enjoyed the intriguing characters, the well animated fight scenes and the dialogues, it of course felt rather incomplete and the cliffhanger at the end of Season 1 left a bad taste in my mouth. I can just imagine all the disappointed faces when they had to wait for so long for this to continue airing back in the days. But I didn't have that much of a problem with it. Another thing which put me off was some of the decisions some Masters and/or Servants made during important fights. If they wanted to, they could have ended this all in one season, but no. Also, some characters didn't get any real light shed at all, but I think everyone will have someone to root for at the end. Another thing which could be a bummer is the extremely slow pacing at times, especially in Season 1 and compared to the very dynamic events in the \"Second Season\u201d. In my opinion, though, that\u2019s what makes the whole watch of Fate/Zero all the more rewarding. The first season is the slow and careful buildup while in the second one everything comes crashing down (in a good way). All in all, Fate/Zero is a fantastic anime with few misteps here and there and a rather week plot. I still recommend it to anyone looking for something a bit different from the generic moe-blobs and ecchi harems we usually get these days. It's worth checking out for this reason alone. And on top of that it's well made and exectued and you get an interesting story with great looking action.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY SECTION: 6/10\\n\r\nPremise 1/2 (not that mindblowing)\\n\r\nPacing 1/2 (kind of slow in S1, too fast in S2)\\n\r\nComplexity 2/2 (a lot of mindgames, intrigue etc.)\\n\r\nPlausibility 0/2 (all the technobabbling still amounts to lose rules)\\n\r\nConclusion 2/2 (great setup for Fate/stay night)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER SECTION: 7/10\\n\r\nPresence 2/2 (cool and strong)\\n\r\nPersonality 2/2 (well founded for the most part)\\n\r\nBackdrop 2/2 (a bit forced but fits well and rounds the characters a lot)\\n\r\nDevelopment 1/2 (only a few get it)\\n\r\nCatharsis 1/2 (overblown, but it's there)\\n\\n\r\nART SECTION: 9/10\\n\r\nGeneral Artwork 2/2 (very detailed and creative)\\n\r\nCharacter Figures 2/2 (stand-out and distinct)\\n\r\nBackgrounds 1/2 (great looking, but very samey)\\n\r\nAnimation 2/2 (very fluent)\\n\r\nVisual Effects 2/2 (great for a TV series)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND SECTION: 9/10\\n\r\nVoice Acting 2/3 (solid)\\n\r\nMusic Themes 4/4 (all around great and fit the show very well)\\n\r\nSound Effects 3/3 (great for a TV series)\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT SECTION: 8/10\\n\r\nArt 1/1 (looks great)\\n\r\nSound 2/2 (sounds amazing)\\n\r\nStory 2/3 (lots of intrigue and the grand scale of things felt epic)\\n\r\nCharacters 3/4 (I liked and rooted for most of them, but some are weak)\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT: 7,8/10 (putting it up to 8/10)",

            "content": "Fate is an anime. At this point I'd usually give some detail about the main story, or characters, but it's a bit difficult to given what I saw. The first episode was 45 minutes in length, which I've got no objections to, GTO comes to mind as another anime with a long first episode, and one that was executed quite well to establish the main character and basis for the story. Fate's opening episode was about as disconnected from the notion of being enjoyable as possible. 45 minutes of consecutive exposition, just one character explaining to another how the story worked. This isn't me tryingto be hyperbolic or witty, that's exactly what it was, and to top it all off, I barely even managed to take in most the information, and was extremely confused, perhaps because I was so bored out of my mind. From what I did gather, there is a Holy Grail which grants people immortality, and so 12th century historical figures have been \"summoned\" to fight over it, and also magic and swordfighting and everything else you expect exists in this universe, but it takes place in the modern day, but these people still have their medieval castles and palaces and the rest of it. The lore was extremely convoluted, a combination of the story's own, real-life ancient history, as well as mythical ancient history (Zeus and all that shit). \\n\r\nThe characters were just boring. Plain and simple. Too many of them, I can't remember the names of any except King Arthur, and I'll be honest I only remember that from doujins. Too many characters, not enough details, and I just don't care about any of them. Who am I supposed to root for? What are everyone's motivations? It's just so poorly thought out, it's like the script was never refined, and it's a natural byproduct of having so many characters, you can't really flesh out any of them. \\n\r\nI thought maybe I'd grown a bit tired of having the plot explained to me for so long, maybe once the action started, and it began to pick up the pace, then finally I would be on board. Can't really say that's the case, it was just uninteresting. The physical clashing of swords didn't interest me much, and when they were utilising invisible ones and healing magic and a bunch of other shit, that just made it even worse. They even went with the anime cliche of having our characters explain their thought processes, moves, and how they were going to circumvent those of their adversaries, but it still didn't make much sense to me.\\n\r\nAnimation was nothing to speak of, can't give any details about the OST, so it couldn't have been that great. All in all Fate's a bit of a convoluted mess: too many characters, too many ideas, too much everything. In regards to fighting, to quote Hammering Heinz \"You hit somebody with your fist and not with your fingers spread.\"",

            "content": "Fate/Zero is about as close to a masterpiece as you can get in terms of quality.\r\nThis anime is, put simply, freaking amazing. I had heard about the fate series since before I even got into anime. I gave stay/night a try, and wasn't able to get into it. So I saw fate/zero, and at the time, I had been in the middle of the stay/night visual novel, so I was reluctant to watch it for fear of spoilers. But, after it was recommended to me by a friend, I chose to watch it, and thank god I did.\r\nArt/Animation 10/10\r\nI was instantly drawn into this series.The animation was near flawless, and the art was beautiful. It makes use of CG at times, but they do it very well, this is made clear with Berserker and another creature who, for now, I will call tentapus. The CG just feels natural with the series instead of sticking out like a certain dragon from a certain series bearing a similar name... \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is nearly flawless, I sat there trying to find a problem with it, and while it isn't smooth as what you might expect after eating some really spicy Vietnamese food, it is still some of the best animation you will find with modern anime. I guarantee you will not be disappointed by the animation, or the art shown in the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnother marvelous work by the wonderful Yuki Kaijura. Some, such as myself, may even consider it some of her best work. If you are unsure who Yuki Kaijura is, some of her works include Elemental Gelade, Pandora Hearts, Sword Art Online, and Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. The soundtrack features many beautiful  orchestral pieces as well as some very nice choirs. The soundtrack sets the mood perfectly, it makes use of epic choirs during the fight scenes, and slow orchestral pieces in the slower, or more darker parts. Overall, the Fate/Zero soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, and easily takes the place as one of my favorite soundtracks of all time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAnother area where this anime shines is in it's characters. There are around 14+ \"Main\" characters that you should be aware of. And that would be the 7 servants, the 7 masters, and a few others that you will see when you watch the series. Instead of using common archetypes such as \"dere\" or unbeatable badass that I like to call the \"Kirito-Complex\", Fate/Zero has a set of characters that are all very unique, and very interesting.Every character acts according to his or her moral compass and ideology.It's always interesting to see different characters interact, in fact, there is one episode dedicated to a few of the servants discussing their beliefs and ideology. If there is one thing I would like to complain about is that some of the characters, I feel, don't get very much focus. Some examples are Berserker, his master, and Assassin. But I don't feel this is too much of a problem, seeing as it did very well with the characters it did focus on in it's 25 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBefore I begin, let me mention my one other complaint with the series, the first episode. I don't feel like it drew me in enough, it was around 50 minutes long, and it was basically an explanation on what the Holy Grail war is, how it originated, and what it is now. Now, this is great, but the episode was kind of slow, and some may even find it boring. Now, assuming you have already read the synopsis, you should have a general idea on what the story is, a battle royale between 7 different teams, each consisting of a legend or historical figure, and a mage. The story is full of twists and turns, and it manages to keep you interested and wanting to keep watching. There were close to no flaws in the overall way the story was executed, except for the first episode. Overall, I loved the story, and I think it was executed very well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was the first series I had seen in awhile where I had been up at 12 in the morning continuing episode upon episode in the couple of days I spent watching it. Still to this day, I think I enjoyed Fate/Zero more then I enjoyed most anime I have seen to this day. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, Fate/Zero is about as close to a masterpiece as you're going to get when it comes to overall quality. I feel that with this series, you could hate the overall story, but you could still admit that it was pretty damn good. This anime is amazing, and I recommend it to everyone. So if you find the time, go check it out, because you might have the same feelings about it as I do, in which case you would love it!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This a review of only the first half of Fate/Zero\r\nFate/Zero is the prequel to the VN Fate/Stay Night. Set during the 4th Holy Grail War, Fate/Zero lived up to what i expected but more. I had watched part of studio Deen's adaptation of Fate/Stay Night and ufotable's Fate/Stay night Unlimited blade works and thought i should give Fate/Zero a try. \r\nStory:\r\nFate/Zero take place during the 4th Holy Grail War, 10 years before the events of Fate/Stay Night. The grail selects 7 master to take part in the war by assigning each master a servant. The story take itself very seriously and very well written Theservants all are based on past heroic spirits. The main plot of the story is simple with each master and servant having their own desire for the grail. But the depth of the characters is what really stands out.  The story starts out with battle between servants, but slows down toward the  end of the first half explaining the motives a bit more.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero focuses heavily on the depth of the characters. From learning about the past of the heroic spirits or the desire and planning the Master provides. Fate/Zero does a good job not letting any of the characters feel like they are a side character and make the holy grail war feel more like a free for all. The way the character are described make you feel there is not really a main villain except maybe for caster and his master but I wont go into that much else\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe style is great for Fate/Zero and very well done. The battle that happen are very intense and the emotion in the characters really show it in the art. It is up to standard of what a 2011 and maybe even better. The sound effects are very realistic and soothing. The OP and ED are great too.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is a great anime that is not to be taken lightly. The feel of this anime very different from Fate/Stay night (from what I've watched) The show makes sure that the characters stay relevant and that none of them are left out like a support character. The show i feel gets dull during a part where the motives  are being explained but there is little to no action. Its a series to watch if you want a strong character development and awesome battles. Ufotable did a great job at this adaptation and can not say much more about that.\\n\\n",

            "content": "One of the most impressive achievements a writer could make is to take an existing concept and make you look at it in a completely different light. This is a feat that is often demonstrated in the works of Gen Urobuchi, and perhaps \u201cFate/Zero\u201d is the work that exemplifies this in the most literal sense, as it is Urobuchi\u2019s way of making his own imprint in the already existing \u201cfate\u201d franchise. It is the prequel story of Nasu Kinoko\u2019s original \u201cFate/Stay-Night\u201d visual novel, telling all about the events of the Holy Grail war of 10 years ago. With a level of ambition that goes throughthe roof, and the production value to match, \u201cFate/Zero\u201d becomes nothing short of an epic.\\n\\n\r\nTaking hold of the protagonist\u2019s role is Emiya Kiritsugu. A trained assassin that uses unconventional methods to reach his goals of making the world a better place regardless of what it takes to get there. Who is the antagonist? A priest by the name of Kotomine Kirei. A former executioner of the church whom struggles with an inner conflict that he believes only Kiritsugu has the answer for. They as well as five others which includes a serial killer, a professor, his student, two mages of noble families (one of which had turned his back on magic), are contenders in an internal war that will grant the winner the prize of the Holy Grail which holds the ability to grant its user any wish imaginable.\\n\\n\r\nTo their help, they each have a legendary hero of the past that has been summoned into separate classes such as \u201cSaber\u201d, \u201cArcher\u201d, \u201cLancer\u201d, \u201cRider\u201d, \u201cCaster\u201d, \u201cAssassin\u201d, and \u201cBerserker\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, you can tell that this is a show that is setting its bars very high, because pretty much every recognizable aspect of \u201cFate/Zero\u201d seems to have been enhanced to its fullest potential. If all you know of the \u201cfate\u201d series beforehand is the \u201cFate/Stay-Night\u201d anime adaptation, then the difference in animation quality is going to be noticeable immediately and I suspect provide quite the shock as well. The difference there is as night and day, and it illustrates perhaps more than anything else the difference in what level of ambition went into these works, as well as further showcasing the talents of studio ufotable.\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Yuki Kajiura is every bit as amazing as it gets. The \u201cFSN\u201d anime already had a soundtrack made by the great Kenji Kawai, and although it too was really good, Yuki Kajuira makes it pale in comparison, which is pretty impressive to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there though. The real difference is in the story itself. The character development is a good example. \u201cFate/Zero\u201d isn\u2019t told through any single character\u2019s perspective. It has the narrative of a third person omniscient\u2019s point of view. The focus shifts from character to character at the story\u2019s own convenience which gives it a good way of establishing the characters of the story without necessarily having them interact with the protagonist or any of the other rival characters. Thus, the characters themselves are not just treated as hurdles for the protagonist to pass, but are treated instead as actual people, representing their own sets of thoughts and ideals. These ideals mainly manifest themselves in answering questions revolving around one of the two central themes of the story. The first question being \u201cwhat makes a king?\u201d, and the second being \u201cwhat makes a hero?\u201d They all have different answers to provide, but none of the answers are treated as the correct one. Even Saber\u2019s ideals, although they seem like they are the noblest ones, become subjects of mockery for Kiritsugu and Rider respectively, and yet both of these characters are treated overall as sympathetic. Even Archer whom originally comes across as a typical villain, gradually manages to build an air of dignity around himself. The show itself is different from \u201cFate/Stay-Night\u201d in that it is the characters that drive the plot forward, and not the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nThough as interesting as the characters are on their own, where \u201cFate/Zero\u201d really starts to shine is once the characters do interact with each other. Not only does each character have a \u201cmaster/servant\u201d relationship with at least one other character, they also find dynamic relationships with other characters that are constantly changing as the story progresses. Some characters become enemies, some become allies. Some enemies become friends, and some allies become foes. Pretty much all possible forms of interactions are explored at one point or another. The only character that is seemingly left out would be assassin, which is only fitting because assassins shouldn\u2019t be interacting with anyone in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe smart thing about the character dynamics is that because there are so many of them, if it is your first time watching (or reading), it becomes pretty hard to predict where each one will lead because a lot of times they conflict with each other. The use of red herrings is all over the place. One example is the setting up of Waver Velvet\u2019s character as someone seeking a way to prove his worth against those who doubted him. You would think that he was being set up to go against Kayneth El-Melloi at some point and yet the only time they interact, Waver is too scared to even move. Kayneth is instead set up against Kiritsugu, as well as to some degree Sola-Ui. Eventually, Waver grows out of his previous mindset completely and recognizes that he is powerless. Something you would probably never see if this had been any other conventional story. A similar example can be seen with the character Tohsaka Tokiomi. One of the most interesting aspects of \u201cFate/Zero\u201d is to just look at where each character starts out, and compare it to where they eventually end up. There are many surprises throughout.\\n\\n\r\nNow the content of the story is as you would expect from Urobuchi\u2019s reputation, very dark. It doesn\u2019t have the typical crapsack setting that you\u2019d usually see in dark stories, but it is dark in other ways. There is a point where a man almost strangles the love of his life to death because she doesn\u2019t understand that he is killing himself, trying to save her daughter. The darkness of it has a sort of poetry to it that makes it emotionally provocative. At another point, a man and his wife are shot to death in cold blood, even after giving up their only chance at winning the war, believing in the deceptive promise that they would keep their lives for doing so. Much of the story contains moments like these, which provide a taste of cynicism and irony.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also an interesting \u201coutside the box\u201d sort of thinking when it comes to some of the ideas used that I want to bring attention too. First off, just the idea of having a main character that uses modern guns when everyone else is using magic, and swords, and whatnot is pretty brilliant. I remember having conversations with a friend when we talked about how easy it would be to kill Voldemort if only you just shot him. Just because magic exists, it may not be the optimal way to go. Then there is the moment when Berserker uses his power to take control of any object and use it as his weapon, which he uses to take hold of a jet, and then its machine guns. You shouldn\u2019t bring a knife to a gun fight, but there is no reason to not bring a gun to a magic fight. Speaking of fighting, if you are only looking to see some great battle animation then you would definitely enjoy the show even for that alone. The Berserker vs Archer fight especially is a sight to behold.\\n\\n\r\nNow of course, one can\u2019t really talk about \u201cFate/Zero\u201d without drawing comparisons to \u201cFate/Stay-Night\u201d. The writer of the original visual novel Nasu Kinoko, has a passion for writing exposition and lore. One of the reasons that the setting of the story is as rich as it is can be credited solely on his vivid and detailed explanations that go as far as to tell us for example of the difference between a mage and a sorcerer, what kind of authority a command spell has, what attributes a servant gets from being of a certain class, etc. All of this has created an impressive platform for the story, and it is something you can see consistently throughout his work.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said though, Nasu Kinoko is not the best storyteller, and it becomes very apparent when compared to Urobuchi\u2019s writing in \u201cZero\u201d. The character aspects mentioned above is one example. Another example is the structure. For some reason, \u201cFSN\u201d chooses to tell its story in a day by day fashion. This quickly becomes formulaic and in many ways makes the story illogical; because it gives the story a strict pattern to follow that becomes predictable. The mornings are always spent at goofing off, the middle of the day is spent at doing all the serious talking, and the night is when they head out to fight a single specific enemy. Then they return back to their homes and repeat the same thing the next day. Compare this to \u201cZero\u2019s\u201d more versatile storytelling, in which the characters are constantly on the move, hardly ever staying at the same place all the time, with some battles taking place immediately after one another, and with varying amounts of participants each time. Any time could be a time to rest as well as a time to be alert, because you never know when the enemy will strike, just like how it would probably play out if this was in real life. Not only does \u201cZero\u201d contain no filler, but it would be impossible to have filler because there would be nowhere to put it. The story simply doesn\u2019t pause. If one character is taking a break then someone else is up to something in the meanwhile. That is quite the difference from having the luxury of being stuck in a magical battle royale and yet finding the time to casually go to high school like a regular student.\\n\\n\r\nThematically, \u201cFate/Zero\u201d is most reminiscent of the \u201cUnlimited Blade Works\u201d route of the \u201cFSN\u201d visual novel. It deconstructs the notions of heroism and challenges the concept of a noble warrior. As the story goes on, the morality of the characters become cloudier, and the focus of their battles shift. For the characters, it becomes not so much a fight against others as much as it becomes a fight against oneself.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cFate/Zero\u201d is pretty much what you get when you take a concept that exists, figure out how to elevate it to its highest form, and then pour as much ambition and effort as you could possibly muster into it to make it all come to life. Studio ufotable has done a remarkable job, and the end result is something completely out of the ordinary.",

            "content": "I don't see Fate/Zero like most of the other people who've set out to review it on here. I was told by a friend that it was an easy 10 but I have yet to be impressed. This is my opinion based on finishing the first season and I am now tempted to skip the second.\r\nStory 5/10\r\nThe Holy Grail chooses 7 Masters, normally with magical abilities, to fight for it's power and grant a wish. Each master uses a servant in which the masters have found relics to summon. The seven class' are combat archetypes that happen to be famous historical characters upon their summoning.The masters in this case all seem to have their different reasoning to want the grail -- some to fulfill personal gains as you'd imagine, and others to change the world in ways they see fit.\\n\\n\r\nThe story seems to be a jumbled mess of figuring out each character instead of an overarching theme. The magic used felt extremely cliche to me and I didn't understand why the grail was so important to begin with. You get a single wish to change the stars and yet, none of them really seemed all too head over heels for that concept. Each person was willing to lay down their life but it was hard to find reasons as to why, even as the series evolved. Just as any forward momentum gets going, you're greeted with Caster being insane and trying to ruin everything. A kill order is issued on him. Everyone attempts to slaw him for the reward and the writer simply uses this opportunity as a way to show bonding between characters and further expose their ambitions. As a viewer, I still got nothing out of this. I saw it coming from miles away and failed to be enchanted by anything this anime had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and soundtrack wasn't my issue at all with this anime. I found them to be extremely well done in my opinion. Opening and closing songs, fight themes, the whole set seemed to be solid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI found it extremely hard to empathize with any of the characters because of how little information they give you to go off of in terms of their wants/desires/history. You find yourself rooting for the good guy as a viewer though it is hard to tell who has any sort of pure intention. I found myself lacking deeper questions and wanting so badly to feel put into a deeper spectrum of thought about such an important question of what one would change with a wish. Instead, I am greeted with that I felt was a very mediocre story because of the countless cliches used.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment was rated 'fair' but I think that comes more from the questions I wish were asked during the series. There was even a point where the servants sit one another down and have a discussion as to whom is the most deserving of the grail. I was more entertained by the questions I personally would have presented in my thought process than what was actually happening on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime would be worth watching to those who are looking for a fun concept. While I think the execution was poor to my taste, many people have found enjoyment in it. I can not deny the fact that this anime has seemed to invoke deep feelings in people who probably will disagree entirely with my review. For my taste, this series felt to be tried and overdone. I wanted to be impressed and instead I found myself near the point of dropping it.",

            "content": "After rewatched this anime about 3 times i believe that now i am in a position of writing a proper review about it without any mistakes about my judgement. Fate/Zero is a prequel to the popular anime Fate/Stay Night(Main route) and Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works(Another route). I would like to mention here that if you havent watched any of the Fate/Stay Night then just go to Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works because compared to the other one, this one is just a masterpiece. \r\nStory - 10\r\nJust like the other Fate series the plot is about the same. The fourth Holy Grail War is aboutto begin in which seven masters must spawn seven servants and fight each other to the death until one of them remains and claim the Holy Grail which will grand him one wish. The story at the begining looks pretty simple but thats just wrong. There are a deeper meaning to everything thats happening and if you are distracted while you are watching then you should just stop watching because you are not going to understand anything at the end. The story is really well writen with intense moments and strong dialogues that are part of the most popular Anime Amv in Youtube.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nWhat can i say.. Just outstanding. Ufotable became my favourite after this anime. The movement of the characters are smooth and amazing. There are beautiful colours and effects during the battles and there were moments that i just paused the episode just to admire how perfect were the graphic details and how well designed were everything even the most unimportant stuff. Just amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nI dont know who made the soundtracks of Fate/Zero but he deserves an Oscar or something like that. They are just perfect for the core of this anime. As i said before there were a lot of intense moments, battles and dialogues but what made those scenes trully epic to the point of giving me chills every time i watched them were the soundtracks. They are among my favourites that for sure.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter - 10\\n\r\nThat is the most dificult part to judge of this anime because compared to others there is a uniqueness to this sector. First of all every character has a different and unique personality and thats just amazing and finally an anime where the main characters are not children. What i found unique in this anime is the fact that the most of the characters introduced to me as main characters. And that was truly epic. There is not the classic stuff of the good guy and the bad ones but every one of them has his own unique reasons of fighting and you have to dicide which one of them is your main or just worship all of them. I dont know about you but this is the first anime that i could actually had this choise and i enjoyed it a lot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nI dont believe that there were even a single scene in Fate/Zero that i didnt enjoy. Humor, battles, mind games, dialogues, emotions. There are scenes with all that kind of stuff and i enjoyed every one of them and how i couldnt when everything you see and hear is part of an one of a kind anime? . I dont believe that there could be more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\nDifinetely a must watch anime. Recomended to anyone. A masterpiece.",

            "content": "The first half of Fate/Zero is a tour de force of character building, technicality and the portrayal of ideologies and conflict, while also serving as a strong foundation for Ufotable\u2019s ever expanding Type-Moon animated universe. In spite of occasionally awkward structure, unclear character motivations and questionable directorial decisions, Fate/Zero succeeds on so many levels that these flaws may almost be forgiven.\r\nThe story of Fate/Zero begins with the introduction of the seven masters, who have been selected to fight in the Holy Grail war, and their respective servants. During this time, the focus is given to their motives, beliefs and nature, allowing the characters to (withsome exceptions) be established firmly. The first few episodes, mainly spent following the scheming and strategizing masters, are relatively slow paced, though there are few redundant or unnecessary scenes. Once the fighting does begin, however, great satisfaction is granted to the viewer as they watch familiar characters, each with their own unique set of skills, battle each other with all their might, wit and passion. However, in the first half of Fate/Zero these fights rarely reach a meaningful resolution, though they do effectively foreshadow more important future conflicts and provide a much-needed break between dense exposition and horrific imagery. As the first half continues, the battles become larger, more threatening and more frequent, as each master gradually learns more about the others. However, though the individual conflicts are engaging and memorable, how and why certain characters are in certain places at specific times doesn\u2019t always make sense. Additionally, though the first two episodes give all the masters abundant screen time, some characters have their time cut down for the sake of others. However, neither of these flaws are too detrimental to the story, as even if the pacing and character focus is uneven, the story always knows who to follow and where to go, even if it isn\u2019t always sure of how to get there. The first half of Zero, consisting heavily of build-up, does not provide much in the way of resolutions, but the intriguing philosophical and psychological themes and consistent, brooding tone allows this weaker half to still feel like a strong series. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Fate/Zero are perhaps its most outstanding component, with the relationships between the individually interesting masters and servants making for some truly memorable dialogue and action sequences. The masters all have strong desires for the Grail, with their motives varying from the desire to protect family, the attain glory or something even more ambitious. This serves as a brilliant method through which characterisation can be delivered, with subtle details about the masters\u2019 mysterious pasts or hidden agendas being presented through their wishes. The masters contrast and parallel each other in a way that allows them to complement each other, rather than cause the narrative to feel bloated under too many philosophies. This is partially what makes the beginning episodes feel so meaningful and powerful, bubbling with the anticipation of eventually pitting these powerful, resolute personalities against each other. However, though the masters themselves are all unique and complex, the heroic spirits are what really solidify Fate/Zero\u2019s character cast as one of the strongest in recent years. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMany of them are from completely different time periods and places in the world, and each of them have strong beliefs and morals that not only allows them to play off their masters, but the other servants even more so. Towards the end of the first season, a conversation between two of the most relevant servants doesn\u2019t only serve as strong characterisation for both of them, and not only does it contrast two conflicting philosophies in a convincing and believable way, but it also serves as a highly thought provoking discussion that will likely leave many viewers questioning their views about the world and themselves. The conflict between servants, and their respective masters, drives both the story and themes of Fate/Zero forward. From themes like utilitarianism, what defines a true hero and what an individual\u2019s purpose in life is, this anime is rich in compelling and intricate themes which it delivers in a way that feels like human conflict, in spite of the fantastical nature of the setting and characters. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visual presentation, Fate/Zero shows exactly what Ufotable are capable of, delivering a series with a variety of detailed and tonally appropriate colour choices and shading. Takeuchi Takashi\u2019s character designs fit the story of Fate/Zero brilliantly, with each character reflecting their cultural identity and heroic status without feeling too alien or unfamiliar. Each individual character design manages to stand out, leaving an impression on the audiences so that, even if they disappear for a while, they are may be easily recalled when they return. The backgrounds are also very detailed and fitting to the story, with an abundance of lavishly coloured and designed set pieces giving the viewer and sense of scale and position. The action sequences are quite spectacular, making use the aforementioned strong character designs with effective cinematography, fluid animation and some well-written battle strategies. The weakest point of the series, visually, would have to be Ei Aoki\u2019s occasionally stiff and lifeless style of directing. When characters are not fighting, they are often reduced to talking heads with negligible expression or attitude, which is very problematic, given the dialogue-driven nature of the series. On top of that, there are several still shots that go on for a little too long at the beginning of the series, with the slow editing adding to the slow story pacing to leave the characters to stand completely on their own. On top of that, even though the backgrounds are stunningly and appropriately coloured, they sometimes feel very monochromatic and lacking in character. These problems do lessen as the series progresses, though in the hands of a more experienced director, the artistic potential of this series would possibly have been reached (ironically, each of the aforementioned flaws have been rectified in the sequel, Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works). In spite of Aoki\u2019s weak directing, Zero is still a visually splendid and well-designed series that stands among the best of its respective year.\\n\\n\r\nIn the category of sound, LiSa\u2019s opening song, \u201cOath Sign\u201d, is a fast and energising listen which, combined with the stellar production values, makes for a good opening, though tonally the song and its lyrics don\u2019t quite match Zero\u2019s bleak nature. Eir Aoi\u2019s ending fares slightly better, though contains what some may consider a spoiler, and also feels like it may be more at home in a less grim series. Yuki Kajiura\u2019s OST is a fitting and suitably epic soundtrack that further invigorates the action to make it stand out even more. Even more impressive, however, is how the elegant violins seep into meaningful interactions between characters, giving them a sense of weight in terms of both emotion and plot significance. Though most of the more impressive tracks do not play until the second half of Fate/Zero, the first half is still a strong series in terms of music. Whether you choose to view this series in sub or dub, the acting is strong and the little meaning is lost. Both the original Japanese voice actors and the English dub providers do have some flaws, though in both cases they are few. Jouji Nakata\u2019s performance as Kirei Kotomine doesn\u2019t quite feel natural, contrasting Kirei\u2019s youthful exterior and feeling oddly unusual, in contrast to Crispin Freeman\u2019s much more natural and fitting vocals. Bridget Hoffman does take a little while to get into her character, though by the mid-point is able to deliver lines on par with her Japanese counter-part, which sadly cannot be said for David Vincent, who never quite manages to capture the cocky arrogance tempered with wisdom and experience that Gilgamesh is known for. For both casts, Saber, Kariya and Kiritsugu all manage to stand out, which may be due to their characters having more emotional scenes that most of the others. On the whole, Fate/Zero is a very high quality, though not flawless, production.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is a powerful and evoking series that has earned its status as being one of the best anime of the decade thus far, presenting many ideas and philosophies, meaningful conflicts and questions, that many lesser series would collapse under the weight of even a fraction of this content. However, it holds together, and this first half presents enough foreshadowing that it is unbelievable that anyone who can make it to the mid-point would desire not to continue.\\n",

            "content": "*Mild spoilers. There isn't too much to spoil here*\r\nPhilosophy. The art of discussing introspective and thought provoking themes. In the midst of war, it may seem pointless to do so, since you'd rather focus on strategies, tactics, and trying to survive the upcoming battle. What if the war was private? What if it were just 7 people and 7 \"servants\" if you wanna call 'em that? Well, then it becomes a bit easier. It also makes things scarier, as a single man is more unpredictable and hard to trace than a whole army. What's even worse is if these \"servants\" are reborn versions of legendarymen and women of the ancient past, and have super destructive powers. At that rate, it's like a hunt, but everyone is both predator and prey, and confrontations have disasterous effects that the higher ups employing the war try to keep quiet. His sounds like a legendary series that was a gift from God himself. Well, not exactly. But, why, you eager fans may cry out? Well, let's find out, shall we? \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n6 people have been contacted for the war. 6 adults if you may, with a 7th to be found. Sick of being mocked by his teacher, Waver Velvet decides to intercept his next delivery, which ends up being the key to summoning the servant Rider. His teacher has a back up that ends up being the servant Lancer. As for the other 5, they have their own rituals and ways of obtaining Saber, Archer, Assassin, Caster, and Berserker. Most got it through traditional means, except Kariya Matou. He filled in for his niece, not wanting to see his scumbag of a father turn her into a child soldier in this Holy Grail War, and goes to get works implanted in him, as that is the only way for a magic-less person like him to summon a servant. With the war begun, we use the first 4 episodes to set up the war, the people in it, and some world building. After a while, there's the occasional skirmish that ends up being just another battle for both people to ask away from. Interestingly enough, Assasin's master, Tokiomi Toosaka, sacrifices him in order to deceive everyone into thinking that he's out of the game, only for everyone to suspect it as deceit, and that there is a whole army of assassins, which never gets explained how that's possible. For the last few episodes, not much happens, which is the crux of the story's problems. It is mostly set up filled in with dialogue and for the last two episodes and episode 10, filler. The story takes itself slowly, fleshing out bits of its characters, which the Caster duo known as Caster and Uuryu getting the most spotlight aside from Saber and her master Kiritsugu. Also, really? A cliffhanger ending? C'mon.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nKiritsugu is the closest to a main character we have, and he's ruthless. More so than other \"kill few to save many\" \"ends justify the means\" characters such as Lelouch. He was a mercenary for much of his life, and with his wife, they go to attend the battle, promising to return to their daughter Illya. Kiritsugu is cold and calculating, using almost terrorist-like tactics, but he is still a well done protagonistic character with questionable morality. His wife, Irisveil Von Einsbern, is a goddess. Not literally, but she is heavenly. Also, she has a determination to go with Kiritsugu's ideals, even when she confesses to Saber that she doesn't understand them that well. Speaking of Saber, she's a decent figure of justice and na\u00efve about how much her devotion to justice due to her position actually affected the people of her time, as Rider aka BROSKANDAR aka Iskandar, and Archer aka Gilgamesh both point out in the banquet of Kings. Maiya is basically Kiritsugu's right hand woman who gets in affairs with him (wow =_=), and a loyal assassin. Kirei Kotomine is an excecutioner who wants to understand why a man like Kiritsugu even signed up for the war, and he's one of the few people here without any ideals or anything to prove; no real goal. \\n\\n\r\nGilgamesh, is a vain asshole who's just as much of a nihilistic person has Kieri himself. Waver Velvet (who ends up brainwashing some old people into believing that he is their grandson so that he can stay) is an underdog college student who just wants some recognition and a goal to follow, which makes him the perfect foil for BROSKANDAR, King of Bros (Islandsr, King of Conquerers) who chastises his meager aspirations and annoys him with his unorthodox manner and attempts at adjusting to such a modern time. I already mentioned Kariya, and his servant has no actual character aside from being an unknown angry being this season. Lancer is a charismatic being who has to take his master, Kayneth's crap, but Kayneth himself (Waver's asshole teacher) had to take crap from his arranged wife, Sola Ui, and neither have much importance or anything interesting about them. To round off those with any importance, we have Caster, and Uuryu. Both are psychopathic murderers who get so messed up, the war gets postponed just to put s target on their backs.\\n\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was the first work to really put the studio Ufotable on the map as a legendary studio of art, and this show looks amazing. The fights are well done, with good coreography, impressive effects like the chaotic black and red moving all around Berserker and anything he touches and uses as a weapon, to Gilgamesh's shining golden armor, to the sparks that fly whenever weapons clash. Hell, even when things aren't flashing brilliantly on screen, the artstyle is very much beautiful, and with the world building and wonderful fashion sense of Irisveil, who ends up giving Saber a suit (tux and everything except for the tie). Hell, not everything is decided by servants and their powers. Kiritsugu uses a gun, which his battle with Kayneth is done brilliantly, and the animation there is no slouch either. Every battle looks amazing, even if none of then have any real consequence. Even Caster's CGI monsters look great, and CGI berserker feels as off as it's supposed to for such an unnerving character. Then again, Ufotable generally does a great job with CGI\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura was the one behind the music here, and the themes are great. In the battle field in particular is an incredible theme. Sure, a lot of the best songs come during 2nd season, but the themes here aren't much of a slouch either. They all fit the scenes rather well, and while not all that memorable, are still good. The OP, Oath Sign, was done by LiSA, which almost automatically means I love it. It was a great theme with more of a mythical and magical feel to it. It was a lovely OP. The ED, isn't so good. It's not BAD per se, but it isn't memorable or interesting, and is completely skippable. The dub, was really great. Matthew Mercer did an excellent job as Kiritsugu. Also, I recognize some of these voices from Blazblue, like Doug Erholtz (Yuuki Terumi) doing a very good Kayneth, David Vincent (Jin Kisaragi) doing a great job as Gilgamesh, Jamieson Price (Tager) portraying our bro BROSKANDAR, Grant George (Kagura Mutsuki) as Lancer, and even Cristina Vee (Noel Vernillion, Nu-13, and Lambda-11) as the little Sakura Matou. Poor Sakura. Violated by Zouken's worms... Hell, Patrick Seitz (Ragna the Bloodedge) plays Fionn mac Cumhaill from Lancer's past. The other voices did a great job as well, even if it takes a while for them to truly shine, like with Johnny Yong Bosch as Uuryu. That happens in season 2.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nI like philosophy in anime. That's why I like the Ghost in the Shell franchise so much. However, in here, Gen Urobuchi, the writer of Fate/Zero's anime adaptation, played that cars just a bit much, and it got kinda boring at points. That and most of episodes 12 and 13 are nothing but filler for just a little bit of fleshing out, but not much. However, the fights more than anything else made this still a very entertaining season for me, and besides, most of the set up and slow burn take place here, rather than spacing it out for season 2 as well. It was interesting, but slow. At least all the setup's out of the way now.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10    RAW SCORE: 84/100\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't an amazing series, but it was an interesting and beautiful one as well. While it's well done and has some interesting philosophy, and has some great action and visuals, it's pretty clear that this first half of the story, and its characters and emotional payoffs are holding back until season 2. If you can get past the first 4 episodes, you're still in for a very recommendable and interesting show that can still keep you on the edge of your seat at times. Well, with that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "\"Glory lies beyond the horizon. Challenge it because it is unreachable. Speak of conquest and demonstrate it\" \r\nRider (Fate/Zero)\r\nAnd thus, I shall try conquering the hearts of my readers, as every soul deserves to see the jewel of an anime that is Fate/Zero. \r\n*This review accounts for both season 1 and season 2 of Fate/Zero.\r\nFate/Zero, prequel to the widely known series Fate/stay night, details the events of the 4th Holy Grail War; 10 years prior to the events as seen in Fate/stay night, which covers the 5th Holy Grail War. The setting is not any different:\r\n- 7 Masters, which are usually magicians, all with thegoal of obtaining the Holy Grail\\n\r\n- 7 Servants, summoned by these magicians, to fight for them in their quest to obtain this Grail\\n\r\n- 1 Holy Grail, a relic which has the power to grant any wish.\\n\\n\r\nJust like in Fate/stay night, this all takes place in Fuyuki City, in Japan: it is here where you will see some incredibly epic fights between the 7 so called \"Masters\" and their \"Servants\u201d. Now what makes this setting any different from your generic action anime? \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nYes, from the plot synopsis, the story might seem like your generic action anime: a Battle Royale setting, where several chosen ones fight to their deaths, all for one goal. What makes Fate/Zero different (and also different from its sequel) is the great execution of this story, the perfect pacing that it provides and the amazing atmosphere that you find yourself in. Fate/Zero doesn\u2019t fool around - it is a story with a very serious atmosphere. You will find hardly any comedy or romance, but In this case it did not bother me at all. In fact, I\u2019m glad that Fate/Zero went with a \u201cno bullshit\u201d policy, because it keeps you focused throughout the whole series. Fate/Zero has quite the complex storyline, which might leave you to think it over at times. But it is this complexity in which Fate/Zero excels: they managed to create a perfect plot, in which every event that you see has its own purpose and consequences. Because there is no clear protagonist in Fate/Zero, you will find yourself wondering what\u2019s going to happen next the whole time, which makes this anime a thrilling experience by itself. Moreover, because you get a good view into each and every Master\u2019s personality traits, background, and desires, you are able to develop some kind of feelings for every single one of them. You will most likely find yourself having a clear favourite in this war, and you will most likely detest some of the others. There are no plot holes, and the ending is so well thought through, that it leaves the viewer astonished. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nStunning. Fate/Zero features the best animation I have seen in an anime so far. They managed to create an atmosphere that perfectly resembles the story. The character design is amazing as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound is the only field on which Fate/Zero did not manage to score a 10 for me \u2013 but that does not make it any worse. The voice acting (I watched in sub) is nothing to complain about \u2013 in fact, I enjoyed listening to every character as they all have great voice acting. The openings are great (I particularly like the first opening), and the BGM is very good, and fitting to the story as well. It is just (barely) not exceptional enough for a perfect score.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are another field in which Fate/Zero truly excels. I personally have yet to see any characterization which can compete to the brilliance that is provided in Fate/Zero. Not only every master, but every servant as well, plays a key role to the plot \u2013 and every character is complex. Every character is written so well, that you are bound to have some form of feelings for each and every one of them. The easily loved servant Rider, one of the most charismatic characters in existence, Archer, a villain with an unmatchable pride, and of course, Saber, one of the greatest female protagonists, are all written in such a way that you might even have trouble picking your favourite. And these are only 3 characters out of an never-ending list of complex characters. I feel like I could not describe every single character well enough, or at least not well enough to give it the credit it deserves. Fate/Zero just did an amazing job with the characters. Period.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis one is easy; absolutely a 10. There\u2019s not even a handful of anime which I have enjoyed as much as Fate/Zero. It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole series, and left me with a feeling of darkness. It is this feeling that made me feel obliged to write this review, as I cannot let other anime fans miss out on the sheer amount of brilliance that Fate/Zero provides. \\n\r\nIf you are seeking a thrilling experience, a story which leaves you questioning, a plot without holes, and amazing characterization, then do not hesitate to watch Fate/Zero, for it is certain that you will enjoy this anime.\\n",

            "content": "Fate zero .. one of the best animes i've ever seen. Personally i enjoyed this anime a lot but i will try to be as objective as possible. \r\nThis review is for the both seasons. \r\nThis anime is a prequel of both routes Fate/stay night and Fate/stay night unlimited blade works .. there are a lot of opinions about the order of the shows .. some say you must start with fate zero, others say you must start with Fate stay night .. well it's up to you. My opinion? It's basically the same. If you like to know the future, to know what isgoing to happen, then watch Fate stay night first. If you like twists and knowing nothing about the story, start with Fate zero. \\n\\n\r\nThe only goal of fate zero is to represent the journey behind fate stay night and fate ubw. And then .. well it happens that came out to be even better than it's sequels.. yeah that is kinda fucked up .. especially Fate stay night, it acts like a little brother who is \"carried\" by fate zero.. regardless all of that, fate zero by it self is not able to make a full show, because it does not have a end so it needs those little brothers. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10. It is nothing HUGE, but for 24 eps it's quite damn good. The pace is outstanding. Each episode they develop the plot, it is not forgotten throughout the entire show like we see in other animes that only focus the characters after presenting the plot. In fact, the plot changes the characters decisions and not the other way around, which is something nice and makes it look more \"real\". Plus, for the epic motive of the war (i mean it's the fucking sant graal .. it makes every wish come true), this anime does well in terms representing the importance that Sant Graal have for each character (such thing does not happen in Fate stay night which deeply pissed me off). We have pacts, betrayals, honor codes, everything you can imagine which just makes the plot more realistic. Although, there are fucking ultra battles in the middle of the city and it seems that the civilians aren\u00b4t there at all... i mean saber can blow up an entire city with her power, but who cares .. they don\u00b4t conect quite well the plot with the rest of the world which for me it's the only thing bad with the plot. \\n\\n\r\nBesides being original and creative, there are true facts behind it. Each servant is a real character that once existed. Of course they were changed a litle bit, but to something better xD. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10. Like fate ubw, this one excels in every single frame. This one of those shows that makes us realize how important the animation is for the anime. It just looks everything look nicer. The detail is astonishing at all levels. We have a mixed of colours, between bright colours and darker ones depending on the situation. And the detail in the action just looks incredibly awesome. \\n\\n\r\nSoud: 9/10. Both the openings are beautiful, but they don\u00b4t fit with the anime's theme in all of it's content. I mean the openings are nice for the drama on it, but it does not match up quite well with the plot. At least i felt that. Anyway every single episode i watched the openings until the end because they just look great. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the OST, are pretty enjoyable also. I found them to be quite good, and they even fit with my style so.. it looks like the OST from SAO because the composer is the same... and it is quite repetitive but, i don\u00b4t mind if they repeat the same OST if it is good. And yes it is.. it match up with the action and with the drama. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10. 7 servants, 7 masters. This is like a mirror game. Each master is the oposite from his servant. One example, while Saber is a noble character, that follows the honor code, Emiya Kiritsugu does not care about those craps and follows a life of \"the ends justify the means\", if killing 100 people will save 200, well then he will kill 100 people. It happens the same with the other 6 masters. And this is quite good because when it comes about developing those 14 characters, we never lose the interest of it. Plus the supportive characters are not forgotten and even some of them were able to made some excellent drama. \\n\\n\r\nEvery character looks different, but still ... the depth at some characters is vastly weak... but for 24 eps long, well we kinda can forget that problem. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10. The first 2-3 episodes are boring. Especially the first episode which is 40 min long of speech. But after those episodes this show gets remarkable. If it wasn\u00b4t for this episodes, i would give it a 10/10 on this category. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. It is a masterpiece of animation and can bring to us a new experience about animes. It excels at every single point and that's why i belive it is a show that everyone should try. It is one of the few animes on my list that has my seal of approval :)",

            "content": "\"The Sun killed a fly on a wall.\"\r\nThere are all kinds of people in this world and everyone is different. We cannot be the same, we should not be the same, that would kill the point, that would kill. Kill! Kill\u2026 No one knows what tomorrow brings us. No one, remember that. And no one can understand you better than you. If you still cannot understand yourself, continue. But the only thing that can save this world is understanding. Mutual understanding. And belief. Belief in others, in the unbelievable, in yourself. So, believe this, understand this, make the light shine brighter. And so, let thisstory begin...\\n\\n\r\nIn the year 1879 lots of things happened. I do not know all the details, but Albert Einstein was born that year and that person has said something very intelligent once: \"You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else.\" It is important to be the best. The world is fond of the winners, only. Losers can lick a bloody floor. My advice, do not be a loser, it is not worth it. But who is a winner and who is a loser, who decides that? You! Yes. You! Make yourself a winner, a hero, make the world obey your rules. Make the world your own world, where YOU will be happy. The best place to exercise your brain skills is the endless circle of your thoughts. Do not let your circle be mutated. You will regret it and die.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you die, how to know who your father is? The general consensus makes us believe that the one who claims to be our father and has some material proof for that is, therefore, our father. But, you can choose your father, too. It does not have to be him who chooses you. You can choose anything nowadays. There are no constants, fluid matter, changeable circumstances, all kinds of customizations, great. This is just a reminder that those things are, indeed, great. Make your own you, your own character, destroy the original you, do whatever you like, it is your game. There is one problem though. No restrictions--no fun. No rules--no fun. Fun is the fuel of our world. If you like to suffer, it is fun to you; if you like to smile, that is then fun to you. The river flows only one direction usually. But does it? Can we be undoubtedly certain that is true? Ask an Aymara person what they think. Probably not the same as you or as most of us do. The only reason we think the way we think is because we were taught to think that way. Our logic is not the only logic in this world. And maybe 'our' logic does not even exist. Individual logic sounds like a plausible thing. I will make that the logic conclusion to the topic of logic.\\n\\n\r\nBut if there would be no logic, could a far away galaxy still be close compared to the one that is further away. I do not understand the universe. I do not know what that is, but I know a lot about vitamins. Vitamin C is good for you. Too much of it is bad for you. If you are a human being, that is. Nowadays, robots do not need vitamin C. It makes their iron melt, I heard. If used with a 2k\u00b0C ray beam. No one I know would survive that, but that is not what I want to think about today. Superior adhesive products make you stick to anything you wish. Stick to your life. Life is important, you know? So is death, and there is no death without life. Thematically, life is but a mere water droplet. Water is one of those very frequently used and abused elements. I feel sorry for water, but the battle must continue. \u201cThe show must go on.\u201d-by a special someone.\\n\\n\r\nA story must be interesting for someone not to find it boring. Stories are based on other stories, on real things, on things perceived by our senses. Many real fragments create something unreal. Put them in a different way, it is a whole different world. Worlds that coexist, that are fundamentally the same, are different. The ones who notice a change between two worlds of the same entity are worth being noticed by that entity. A red faint line on the edge of a world can be a bright black light. What is that? I do not think it matters. Spoil the story, you still cannot spoil the world, let alone the entity. Amongst conclusions of doubt-filled depths of illusion, no one is right. Only the written word is right. There are no other truths. Interpretations of the truth, still can be the truth. Because the truth is inevitably wide, the truth is an endlessly evolving form. It is everywhere. Sense it harder. It is there. Sense it more. It is you.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is something, everything or nothing at all. This sentence is absolutely true. Everything is more than something. Though, something can be a plenty if that is what you want it to be. Nothing is, however, nothing, null, void. Nothing is at the same time something special, too. A whole new experience, stunning sensation, something one should live for! This unbelievably unbelievable anime made me think about lots of things. Therefore, I think it is a good anime. Characters are the story, the story is the characters. Sound is art. Overall is enjoyment. Enjoyment is fun. If you do not think you will like it my way, you will like it your way. Watch it and become a superior anime fan. Be someone you can be proud of, be your own hero, be an object of admiration. You only live once. Peace brother. Peace father, I will miss you. Peace to my family and friends, I love you all. Thank you for reading this. Peace.",

The action scenes never disappoint and are always beautifully animated.  Fate/Zero's setting is a little underwhelming, and does not hurt the show nor add to it.  The music and sound design in the show are fittingly epic and energetic.  The theme song took a little while to grow on me, but is worthy of praise for its thrilling chorus.  All of the characters in the show have something interesting to offer to theplot and are gorgeously animated.  Fate/Zero was immediately intriguing and held my attention to the bitter end.  Some dialogue feels unnecessary, but all the other amazing aspects of the show more than make up for it.",

            "content": "The Video Review is out, but here is the written review. This Review covers both seasons of Fate/Zero.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nSet 10 years before the story of Fate/Stay Night, Fate Zero follows the story of 7 masters as they fight in the Fourth Holy Grail War. The concept is still the same as it was with the original, however it is more and explained better in this adaptation. 7 Masters summon a servant to fight for them, in order to obtain the ultimate wish fulfilling device known as the Holy Grail. One thing Fate/Zero has going for itself is its maturity. Unlike the original Fate/Stay Night,Fate/Zero has a much darker and more mature theme. The plot follows the story of Kiritsugu Emiya, who was Shirou\u2019s father back in the original Fate/Stay Night.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that really hinders the story is the pacing and the fact, the Holy Grail war is still a complex system to get your head around. It is better explained and told in Fate/Zero, but because of that explanation, the start is slow. The very first episode is a double episode special on the character study and setup of the Holy Grail War. Because they\u2019re literally trying to explain the whole setup of the Holy Grail war in one episode, and even episode 2 as well, it starts off slow. The ending is also anti-climactic as it is meant to setup for Fate/Stay Night. But everything in between is just excitement after excitement, it really doesn\u2019t slow down drastically, and there is so much tension. And it\u2019s because of the characters in Fate/Zero that really makes the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I mention earlier, Fate/Zero is much more mature than Fate/Stay Night, the characters, the masters are not teens, and they\u2019re all adults. Because all the characters are so unique and interesting in their own way, I can\u2019t mention them all, otherwise we\u2019ll be here all day. So here is only a handful of them.\\n\\n\r\nKiritsugu Emiya is the main protagonist. He\u2019s not really a your stereotypical protagonist, he kinds of shows more resemblance of an anti-hero. Kiritsugu\u2019s main reason for fighting in the war is to end all conflict, and it doesn\u2019t matter how many sacrifices, it\u2019ll cost, as he is hoping to save more people in the process. Example, he\u2019ll sacrifice 100 people to save 200 people. He fights as an unconventional mage, only using magic if he really needs to, but uses firearms to fight his opponents. He doesn\u2019t care how it\u2019s done, as long as it gets the job done.\\n\\n\r\nSaber returns from Fate/Stay Night with a clearer goal and development. Saber like Kiritsugu is fighting in the Holy Grail war for peace. Unlike Kiritsugu, she has a sense of honour, and would rather be honoured than gain the victory. I like how her character is given much more, she sorts of comes in as novice with a unremarkable talent, however she learns what is it really meant to lead. Saber only follows Kiritsugu, because she has to.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I love about Fate/Zero is the relationships between Masters and their Servants. Kiritsugu and Saber have the same goal, but because their ideological perspectives are different, they fight differently and always conflict with each other\u2019s ideas. And this is just not for Kiritsugu and Saber, pretty most of the masters and servants have conflicting personalities and ideas, with the exception of Ryuunosuke and his servant, Caster. Walver Velvet is fighting in the war to get recognition, whereas his servant Rider, Iskandar the King of Conquerors is in the war to take over the world. Tokiomi Tohsaka is in the war to gain the root of all knowledge, while his servant, Archer, Gilgamesh King of Heroes, is the self-proclaimed king/god of all things, who finds Tokiomi boring.\\n\\n\r\nKirei Kotomine is one of the other main characters of the show. He is fighting in the war to find a sense of purpose in the world. Kirei sees himself in Kiritsugu, and wishes to find Kiritsugu to help him give him the answer he wants. And we really see how his character is developed in the character he is in Fate/Stay Night.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I love all about these characters is their motivations for fighting in the Holy Grail War. The first two episodes quickly tries to get their motivations out of the way so it doesn\u2019t get in the way of too much plot, but their motivations are all so unique and interesting. I especially love the side story of the three kings and what\u2019s it like to be a hero. Do you fighting for Victory, or do you maintain your honour. Saber, Archer and especially Rider really shine on this theme. \\n\\n\r\nThe show does rather well of not showing a true protagonist, at points I literally just want everyone win, because they have all have a good and interesting reason for winning. I love all these characters, every time Rider was on screen his charisma steals the scene. When Gilgamesh is on the scene, he\u2019s such an arrogant badass, and Saber is just Saber.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 10/10. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art is amazing. Being made in 2011, Fate/Zero still has one of the best animation till this day. Every action scene is amazing and is well animated. Every special effect looks gorgeous and suits the character\u2019s style and theme. One thing that was improved from original Fate/Stay Night is Saber\u2019s invisible sword, the wind particles surrounding her sword looks good, and it shows the animators weren\u2019t lazy in not putting anything to show that there is a sword there. Because it\u2019s a battle royal, the action constantly jumps from one action scene to another, to show how amazing each scene and visual effects in it. You\u2019re never really thrown out of the world, because it all looks gorgeous. \\n\\n\r\nI love the soundtrack of Fate/Zero. It really fits the mood and setting of show. It has a very good mixture of fantasy music to urban warfare music. The music gets dark when it needs to be, and gets epic when it needs to be, it really is an amazing soundtrack to listen to. The opening and the ending themes are great as well. I love the openings and ending themes of Fate/Zero, especially the first opening and ending, Oath Sign and Memoria. I love the voice acting, I think every character is suited perfectly, whoever played Rider really deserves a reward, as he is able to make that the character come to life. Only little problem is Kirei\u2019s voice, because they used the same voice actor from Fate/Stay Night, his voice is still really deep as hell, and he is depicted as a much younger version in Fate/Zero compared to the older version in Fate/Stay Night.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really love Fate/Zero, it\u2019s become one of my favourite anime of all time. I love just about almost every character in Fate/Zero, I was rooting for them to win. There was not one point in the story where I was like I just want this person to win. Almost all the characters deserved to win. The action scenes are amazing to look at, I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off and the story is really engaging as well. The soundtrack really added to world, I felt like I was really immersed in the world.\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019re probably not going to enjoy Fate/Zero as much if you already know what\u2019s going to happen. If you\u2019ve watch Fate/Stay Night, you\u2019re already know what\u2019s going to happen, and keeping that in mind, you\u2019re probably going to expect what the outcomes are going to be anyway. However the journey is still amazing. Yes, the lore is still confusing, but it is better explained in this adaptation, and once you\u2019re passed that, it\u2019s just an enjoyable ride from there on.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs we draw closer to the final verdict, first I give the story of Fate/Zero a 9. Yes the story starts rather slow, and there is anti-climactic ending. But it\u2019s everything in between is and exciting and interesting well developed story. I especially love the side stories as well, which rarely happens. When you get to the second half, it just non-stop excitement one after another.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound of Fate/Zero gets a 10 and 9 from me. Ufotable has pulled off something amazing giving us one the best animated series to date. The action and stunning visual effects look amazing, and everything really fits it\u2019s range of characters perfectly. The soundtrack fits well with the show and the voicing acting was great as well. However there was just still a bit of something missing from it, to make it really memorable.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters of Fate/Zero, I give them 10. I love every character in this series, and thought they were developed well. They all had an interesting and good reasons for fighting in the war, and I couldn\u2019t decide who I wanted to win the most. The servants interactions with each other is good and their interactions with their masters are well thought out. \\n\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 10. I was immersed in this world, I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off the screen. I loved watching the cast of characters that were on screen, and story that really grips me. The art was amazing to watch, it looked very beautiful. And because I did watch Fate/Zero first, I did not know what to expect.\\n\\n\r\nSo for the overall rating after rounding it up, I give Fate/Zero a 9.5/10. It\u2019s one of the best anime\u2019s I\u2019ve ever seen, it looks amazing, the plot and characters really work well. Yes it has a slow start and a predictable end, but the journey in between is amazing. I recommend this anime to any fans of the fantasy genre, especially action. However I would recommend this to any anime fans, just to see how visually appealing it is, and to see a more mature themed story. If you\u2019re trying to get into the Fate series, you don\u2019t have to watch Fate/Stay Night (2006) first, this is good starting point, but if you do watch this first, I wouldn\u2019t recommend watching Fate/Stay Night (2006) after, to see the dip in quality. But regardless, I think this is a must watch.",

            "content": "Stop! Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side ye see.\r\nWhat... is your name?\r\n-My name is sir Xpwn3ntial of MAL!\r\nWhat... is your quest?\r\n-To seek the Holy Grail!\r\nWhat... do you think of Fate/Zero?\r\n-Fate/Zero is definitely one of the best works of 2011 and a pleasant offering to the anime industry by Ufotable. I'm going to try and keep this simple, so I'll start with givens that don't need too much elaboration.\r\nThe animation is fantastic. The staff knew exactly where to take their shortcuts and their implementation of CGI is seamlessly integrated into the 2D to give itan \"otherworldly\" feel that I thought was impossible. The backgrounds are gorgeous, and add to the scenes they are in. This is the kind of animation expected from movies, not television series.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, while not Yuki Kajiura's best work (I still think of Garden of Sinners to hold that title, which incidentally, is another Ufotable title), still lives up to her reputation. While some of the tracks are interchangeable with her other soundtracks like Garden of Sinners or Puella Magi Madoka Magica, they still fit the scenes and situations in Fate/Zero sufficiently, adding more tone than their utility takes away.\\n\\n\r\nThe tone and fight choreography are very well done. The pacing for fight scenes never dragged on, and only one fight in the series feels like it ended too quickly. The fights themselves offer fluid movements at almost all times and dialogue exchange when necessary so that viewers can understand the situation at hand.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I've gone through the simple, given qualities of the work, I'll move on to more elaborate reviewing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Holy Grail War is basically an elaborate MacGuffin to bring all of the characters together and have them fight to the death. There's nothing wrong with having a MacGuffin, and Fate/Zero uses it to its advantage as well as a MacGuffin can be used. The problem with this is that someone can give a synopsis in one sentence, \"All these people throughout history are fighting over the Holy Grail.\" A MacGuffin can only be so interesting, but luckily there is something I can only call a major sub-plot to make things more interesting. The major sub-plot of the series about Caster makes things more interesting, causing alliances that require the mentality \"the enemy of my enemy is  my temporary ally, and only temporary.\" It creates intrigue greater than \"they want this but so do I so we must fight.\" The major sub-plot could only work in Fate/Zero's advantage, and it did.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Fate/Zero don't fit into any stereotypes so prevalent in anime today, and most of them have complex or honorable motivations for fighting the war and choosing which one the viewer should support comes down to personal worldview as opposed to good vs. evil. When I say most, I mean most. It would have been nice one of the motivations didn't boil down to \"It's shiny so I want it.\" Another one of them has naivete that cannot be taken seriously, making proposals expected out of someone who is unaware of the situation he is in. On the whole, the characters of Fate/Zero are great, but not amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThis show goes through the entire emotional spectrum, and each of those emotions can reach even the most stoic of individuals at least once. It's depressing, it's fun, it's intriguing, it's complex, it's subtle, it's over the top, it's got something for everyone. The downside to this is that this series is trying to juggle too many things and even genres at once within twelve episodes of a series and one that just feels like filler right now but will most likely become important in the next season where it belonged in the first place. It doesn't know whether to be a psychological thriller, a low fantasy character drama, a lighthearted shonen romp, a cerebral battle of minds, or a Lovecraftian horror story. It implements each aspect well enough to enjoy, but it really needed more time to let the moods and tones flow from one to the next.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to my next point. The main problem with this anime is that it is incomplete. It ends on a massive cliffhanger and while the next season Fate/Zero 2 is bound to be one of the best parts of 2012, it still requires a prequel season called Fate/Zero. That's actually why I gave this show an eight instead of a nine. An incomplete production can't get a 10, and if it was self-contained, it would have gotten a nine out of this review.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: Definitely worth watching. No matter who you are, there simply has to be something for you in this show and when you reach the end you're only left wanting more.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nThat took too long for you to say so I won't let you cross.\\n\\n\r\n-Why didn't you tell me I had a time limit?\\n\\n\r\nI don't kno- AAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!",

            "content": "In its three months run, Fate/Zero has managed to amass quite the following. It dazzles the audience with its highly stylized visuals, sports a fanciful narrative and boasts a multidimensional cast of characters. It\u2019s certainly a complete package that any anime fan will enjoy and doesn\u2019t really require comprehensive knowledge of previous Type-Moon works to be appreciated despite what others may tell you. It\u2019s a prequel that can stand and be valued on its own terms. \r\nFate/Zero is set up as a prequel and takes place 10 years before the events of Fate/Stay Night. Yet despite the continuity between these two works, they share littlein common besides some characters and themes. The plot details a battle royale between several Magi as they fight each other to death for the Holy Grail. Each Magi comes with their Servant, a heroic spirit drawn to the power of the Grail. Everyone comes with their own motives, strengths and weaknesses and the audience plays the witness as everything comes together in a pulse-pounding an intense manner. The pacing and set-up for everything is expertly fine-tuned and executed so the entire show is very gripping from start to end. Along the way, you\u2019ll end up hating some characters, latching onto others and developing newfound respect for otherwise despicable ones. F/Z\u2019s cast is very well written in the sense that they have a very clear set of traits and a defined character arc that progresses in dynamic ways with respect to the other characters. More importantly though, there isn\u2019t a clearly defined moral landscape. Many characters are very ambiguous in their motives and actions. In fact the difference between the protagonist and the antagonist is almost nonexistent at the beginning. Aside from the context of their backgrounds, Kiritsugu and Kotomine are very similar. Yet the juxtaposition and dichotomy of the two set the tone for the rest of Fate/Zero. Certainly that tone may appear to be outwardly dreary and grim, almost excessively so, but the overall nature of the show is pragmatic. Kinoko Nasu, the writer of Fate/Stay Night, used his characters as springboards for elongated scenes of philosophical contemplation. Yet that\u2019s not present in Fate/Zero. While it is definitely a character study at heart, it\u2019s more about character dynamics and development than introspection. Which basically means Fate/Zero has much more focus with its characters, for better or for worse. This is one of the key facets where Fate/Zero and F/SN differ greatly. I\u2019m not saying that one is objectively better than the other; instead they\u2019re both good but for wildly different reasons. If you\u2019re someone who adored the technobabble elements of Nasu\u2019s works, than you might be put off with how straight-forward everything is in F/Z.  With that said, F/Z is still very solid with its narrative and cast, they intrigue and entertain the entire way through.\\n\\n\r\nThe structure and pacing of F/Z is a bit of a different story. The basic layout is exposition, followed by buildup and ends with a confrontation. This cycle repeats itself multiple times and follows the same basic structure of the novels, adapting it competently enough. However F/Z does trip its own feet towards the end of its run. Specifically, I\u2019m referring to episodes ten and eleven. My thoughts go along the lines of \u201cGoddammit ufotable, what the fuck were you thinking?\u201d. The main problem here is that episode ten is completely out of place with the rest of the show. No there\u2019s nothing particularly bad about the content of the episode.  It\u2019s just that something that should have been a simple side story, is stretched to the length of an entire episode.  And as a result, the pacing of the show is thrown off balance. To add to this questionable decision, episode eleven on the other hand is erratically paced. One episode is too slow, not particularly engaging and has far too little development for the main plot, while the other episode is far too quick. It literally rushes through a lot of important material and gives us the short end of the stick in terms of character development and insight. It also doesn\u2019t really give the audience time to fully digest and internalize a lot of the events that occur. To further add insult to injury, episode eleven (the one that\u2019s actually important to the show) gets horrendous production values. And not just you\u2019re typical QUALITY here and there; I mean an entire episode that is a clear step down from the others in terms of overall animation, art and direction. Yeah yeah, it\u2019ll probably get \u201cfixed\u201d in the BD release, but I\u2019m not reviewing the BD release now am I? Unfortunately, this little misstep sticks out like a sore thumb and just grates on my nerves like nobody\u2019s business. This really stops me from loving the show to pieces, but oh well maybe the second season won\u2019t make such grievous mistakes. \\n\\n\r\n One of my favorite parts about Fate/Zero is the direction. It\u2019s definitely one of the more standout shows this year, similar to Penguindrum, Idolmaster and Nichijou in terms of storyboarding and animation prowess. You get a lot of people often saying that ufotable animates their shows really well, but that\u2019s not entirely correct. A storyboard is basically barebones key animation, a rough sketch of the scene with a summary of what the director wants the key animator to do.  Back when they first started out, ufotable was a studio that put more focus on key animation than storyboards. However, somewhere down the road they shifted this focus to storyboarding, its particularly noticeable first in Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight. This change in focus really bore fruit when they started working on Kara no Kyoukai. What this means is, they started to put a lot more detail into their storyboarding. Stuff like expression changes, minute details in character movement, are very apparent in this style of storyboarding (which if I had to define, is probably slow, weighty and very precise). It\u2019s the same style they use for Fate/Zero and the results are very good. The general composition for a shot is superb and meticulously detailed. A lot of the off-center shots it has are great for the atmosphere; it shows the audience multiple subjects within a single frame and builds immersion. What you get is a show that manages to not only hold your attention for its 23-minute duration, but really draws you into its world. The animation on the other hand, ends up playing second fiddle to storyboarding and composition work. Outside of fight scenes, the animation is rather stiff and lacking in detail. However it\u2019s not too noticeable mainly because the framework is excellent. You\u2019ll come across very little badly animated scenes in Fate/Zero which is certainly a complement, since most TV anime these days have a hard time keeping the quality up for just one episode. This is in part due the fact that ufotable is keeping F/Z as a complete in-house production which is very rare in the industry. The only other mainline anime studios that do this are Kyoani and Gainax (their original anime projects). An in-house production benefits from having a uniformly singular, cohesive vision that many anime don\u2019t have the luxury of getting. The end product is very well put together and consistent in quality. The only real weak link in the overall bundle is probably the music in my opinion. I know everyone loves Kajiura and drones on and on about how great her work is, but it\u2019s rather forgettable here. Aside from the sweeping scores that accompany fight or tense scenes, there really aren\u2019t many standout tunes. Kara no Kyoukai benefitted from her work, but for some reason F/Z is missing strong melodic or ambient sounds, which could have greatly helped with atmosphere building. It\u2019s wasted potential in this otherwise tight package. The voice work is top notch; stand out performances includes the entire fucking cast. I can\u2019t think of a single character whose lines aren\u2019t delivered with panache and emotion. It\u2019s some of the best and most enjoyable voice work I\u2019ve heard in quite a long time and if I really had to choose just one performance, it\u2019d be Jouji Nakata. Behold everyone; THIS is how you breathe life into a villain. \\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is definitely of the better shows to come out this year. It\u2019s not necessary to be a Type-Moon buff to enjoy it; in fact it\u2019s probably one of more accessible works out of the Nasuverse. People might say that watching Fate/Zero before F/SN will ruin the whole thing but honestly, it doesn\u2019t really matter. Both can function as a starting point in the series, Fate/Zero is written to be a sufficient gateway as well. Many people seem to forget that Nasu and Butch wrote the novels with this in mind. So go for it, you really can\u2019t go wrong with an anime like this. The best part about this show is that it doesn\u2019t even cover the best parts of the novel, so we have quite the second season ahead of us.",

            "content": "I will start off by saying, that I went straight into writing this review after finishing the first season. Having not watched the second season, this is a unbiased point of view of solely the first thirteen episodes of Fate/Zero. I would have liked to review the whole two seasons together, but the sudden division has left me with no choice. Not having the substitution of a visual novel, in a sense, I feel that the first season was overrated. There was no comparison to the seemingly \"superior\" VN of Fate/Stay Night. Thus much of the ratings must have been based on a a firstperson view not tarnished by any previous media other than the light novel that closely followed the anime. \\n\\n\r\nNow with the formalities out of the way, Fate/Zero has done many things right and wrong compared to Fate/Stay Night, and probably like many others, I seek to compare them in this review. While I believe that the superficiality, notably sound and art, have contributed mostly to the high ratings, I seek to go beyond that. \\n\\n\r\nStory - One of the best additions to Fate/Zero compared to its predecessor is its much deeper story. The anime has done a great job of setting up an atmosphere that emphasizes the large scale epicness that is the Holy Grail War. While in Fate/Stay Night that feeling stayed rather confined into a seemingly small city, Fate/Zero masterfully expands it and demonstrates an overwhelming significance of the war. In addition, Zero establishes ambiguity in a good sense: in that you can't anticipate what happens next. While Stay Night had many twists and turns in it, Zero does it to a better degree, leaving you in the dark and creating a stronger sense of excitement and apprehension. In addition, Zero has more lucidly explained the phenomenon of the Holy War, something that SN lacked in. However, story progression is agonizingly slow, and each episode feels rather standalone and in turn, I feel little addiction to it. Conversations are intellectual, but take up a bit too much time. Hopefully, the second season resolves this issue, and proves the suspense and conversations were actually worthwhile. \\n\\n\r\nArt - Compared to Fate in 2006, Zero has done an incrementally better job of perfecting the artwork. However, comparing a 2012 anime to a 2006 in terms of art is hardly fair, but Zero has fixed a few flaws in SN. Fight scenes demonstrate a greater diversity in fighting styles, camera angles, and no longer displays repetition, as each slash, each movement, each bullet has a different animation to it. The use of cinematic scenes adds to what I have mentioned, leading to more captivating scenes, reminiscent of the spectacular fight scenes in Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. \\n\\n\r\nSound - In terms of music, SN takes the cake for a soundtrack that has variety, clarity, and just plainly gets stuck in your head. Zero focused on a more cinematic, movie-like soundtrack that may be more pleasurable to others, but to me, is simply not memorable. I enjoyed the opening and ending thoroughly better, but I feel like they do not capture the essence of the anime like the ones in SN did. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - My main problem with Zero is that there is no real main character, as Saber and Kiritsugu just don't feel like them. In a sense, it draws comparisons to the unique character setup of Baccano, but in all sincerity, is inferior. While this type of narration does increase suspense, in that it is difficult to detect their intentions, it vitally destroys connection towards them. Anything negative that happens to any character, even the Saber that was developed in SN, all seems to part of the grand scheme of things. The characters are inflexible and all show only one side of themselves, and that leads to little possible development. Like I said before, I hope that the second season changes my perception of that, illuminating the personalities and decisions of the characters instead of keeping them rigid. \\n\\n\r\nIf it was a standalone series, Fate/Zero would not have impressed me enough. Luckily, at the conclusion of it, it is obvious that there is a second season. Compared to the first thirteen episodes of SN, Zero wins without a doubt, heavily in terms of narration, story line and art. However, SN rose to a new level in the next half of the show, and I await the second season to follow that legacy.",

            "content": "Heroism. A concept often taken for granted, with very clear lines between right and wrong. What ends up defining a person being a hero isn't quite as simple in real life, and is largely defined or judged by a person's moral standards. Some people would go so far to argue that heroism isn't even a completely plausible concept, considering that no one fits the perfect image of a hero in real life.\r\nMany of the simple goals that apply to such individuals are not easy to achieve. It's not easy to accomplish something on a greater level, and it is only natural that once their lifeis forfeit, they carry their regrets, wishes and dreams with them to the grave.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the moral conflict centered around the Fate series in general and Fate/Zero in particular, and it works exceptionally well; we see many perspectives on such subjects, and there is an entire conflict whether the end justifies the means or the means justifies the end. \\n\\n\r\nThis works due to the fantastic character dynamics and interactions throughout the show, with a lot of amazing dialogue that fleshes out the characters and makes us understand their line of thinking in an extremely detailed manner.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, as one would expect from a tournament where the winner can literally make any wish come true, the battles are beautifully animated and filled with adrenaline. This show is intense and makes absolutely certain to keep the suspense high by not knowing who is the main character and making every battle a potential life or death battle. Viewers will be rooting for different characters over the course of the show depending on their own moral dilemmas, and it is undeniably interesting to talk about this show and find out who was rooting for who.\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation is top notch, with some absolutely chilling scenes out of just the dialogue, surpassing some of the actual battles in the show (as astounding as that sounds). The exposition isn't as well handled as one would expect, and this is especially apparent in the first episode which is literally 40 minutes of explaining everything about the Holy Grail War in every bit of detail possible as well as introduce us to the various participants. The first episode is undeniably better if you have more experience with the franchise, but comes off as rather lengthy and boring if this is your introduction to the franchise (though I'd personally argue it's worth it).\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is clean and distinct, with absolutely amazing character designs and amazing amount of detail in facial expressions and beautifully drawn movements. The animation is gorgeous, with CGI being used exceptionally well and the battles being easily among the best I've seen out of anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is no exception, with Yuki Kajura being as amazing as ever and delvering some absolutely amazing tracks in the show, my personal favorites being \"Let the Stars fall down\" and the ending theme, Memoria. The voice acting is just as amazing in both Japanese and English, with the voice actors fitting their respective roles extremely well.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the first season builds up very for the second season and acts as an introduction of sorts to all the characters before tragedy hits. This works extremely well, and patience will be rewarded in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is ultimately an excellent show with amazing dialogue, great characters and gorgeous battles. It suffers from being too expository for its own good, and while that can be a turn off initially it becomes very rewarding as the show continues. I highly recommend it for its mature and morally ambiguous handling of various ideals and balancing so many different perspectives so well, and I believe there is something in this show for just about everyone.",

            "content": "[This review probably contains some generalized spoilers, and it's probably leaning slightly towards fanboyism. It's extremely disorganized, but it's also insightful. ] \r\nFate/zero is by far, the top show aired this fall season. Now what makes Fate/zero the \u201cbest\u201d of the season? Well, numerous reasons do. In comparison to the sequel Fate/stay night (sequel was adapted prior by another animation studio), Fate/zero was animated by Ufotable. Ufotable was the production company between the acclaimed Kara no Kyoukai series. This being said, Fate/zero boasts top-notch production quality along with vivid storytelling.\r\n(I normally don't do blatant summaries, but it's kind of necessary for this review. Fate/zero basicallyrevolves around winning the Holy Grail. The Holy Grail basically grants the master any wish, and to win, the master has to eliminate the other masters through the assistance of servants. In other words, it's a survival game between the masters, and last man standing wins.) \\n\\n\r\nNow, the combat in Fate/zero revolves around the use of \u201cmana\u201d, but it's by no means a recycled concept. The magic is Fate/zero is nowhere near the system of \u201ctraditional magic\u201d. Traditional magic would revolve around casting the elements of fire, water, air and earth. In comparison with other anime that include \u201cmagic\u201d, the magic in Fate/zero doesn't revolve around wizardry and casting spells. It's almost done in a completely different manner, it could hardly be called just magic, there's so many elements in play (I'll leave out the specifics in the review, it's much more fulfilling to actually see it).  \\n\\n\r\nThe combat in Fate/zero is also something to be noted. Unlike the majority of action anime where action is relatively linear (trading blows, bigger spells do more damage, etc), the combat in Fate/zero is strategic. It's basically a giant chess game between the masters as to what to do next, each master has their strengths, and each has their weaknesses. It's up to them to safeguard their weaknesses, and to exploit their opponent's weaknesses. But this doesn't mean the action scenes are lackluster, they're actually animated extremely well. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, even though there are numerous action scenes, a vast majority of the first season is dialogue. Unlike the majority of \u201caction\u201d anime, the story isn't told through mindless combat. Brains wins over brawn when it comes to storytelling. The dialogue not only builds and galvanizes the storyline, but it also gives great insight on the \u201cmechanics\u201d of the world, all within a relatively short period of time. \\n\\n\r\nRemarkably, the characters are actually all \u201cgood\u201d. Not good as in they're all likable, but good as in they're not generic; they're all somewhat complex. There isn't a black and white behind the motives of the of the characters. They're all distinct, and they all have an aspect of their personality that ultimately separates them from one another. It's difficult to logically blatantly claim which character is \u201cright\u201d, it's a battle of morals. The ethics you uphold will most likely be the decisive catalyst in deciding who should win. Unfortunately, the individual characters aren't as developed as much as I'd like them to be. It's a relatively short season, there just isn't enough time to successfully build each character. It's an inevitable reality to have to homogenize some portions of their personalities and beliefs with logical deductions. However, the second season should develop the characters further, to a greater extent. (From what I know, the second season is airing during the spring season to ensure the top-notch production quality)\\n\\n\r\nFate/zero also manages to incorporate some philosophical arguments. The philosophy that each character holds, drives and catalyzes their lust for victory. There isn't a clear good, and there isn't a clear bad in Fate/zero. It doesn't have the luxury of using a monochromatic scheme when it comes to deciding on what's good and what's bad. It's mostly decided on whether you agree with the motives of the masters or not. The motives could be argued as just and right, but it could also be argued for as blind and arrogant.\\n\\n\r\nFate/zero also manages to implement some history into it. Although relatively minor, it's there. The servants are basically derived from some notable figure in history. The actual identity of the servants could be easy, or it could be difficult. It's almost a game of it's own to figure out the actual identities of the servants without searching it up. It's not that significant, but it's still, an awesome inclusion.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, Fate/zero is a great show. It's entertaining to watch, and was a pain to keep up with while on-going (was under the paranoia that the show would inevitably end up as a disappointment). It's definitely worth checking out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nObjective Score: 9/10. Although Fate/zero is a great show, it's doesn't match up to my definition of a masterpiece. It has a few setbacks such as character development, and a somewhat rushed storyline, but its benefits far outweigh the deficits. \\n\\n\r\nSubjective Score: 10/10. Now,  if you only look on the positives of the show, then it's a masterpiece. It contains everything that the majority of people look for in an anime. It has a great storyline, it has unique characters, amazing action scenes, as well as a level of immersion. It keeps the viewer anticipating the next episode, and continues to enthrall them in the prospects of the second concluding season.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero is exciting. The amount of substance in the writing is beyond belief, and the unconventionality of the morals and characters make it inherently interesting.\r\nThe show focuses heavily on Kiritsugu Emiya and Kirei Kotomine, though no protagonists are entirely selected and all sides get screentime. Even though they both appear to be uninteresting and unlikeable, both of their struggles and their relationships toward other characters and servants are captivating. Kiritsugu wants to \u201csave the world\u201d and be a \u201chero of justice\u201d and rid it of evil and war, yet he commits a slew of horrible murders and deceptions to reach his goal. Kirei is anempty and confused priest that doesn\u2019t feel much emotion, so he wishes to know what exactly gives him pleasure. Kirei\u2019s plight is explored more in the second season, but from early on Kiritsugu makes the audience question the definition of \u201chero.\u201d  There\u2019s a bunch of internal politics going on, since it involves mage families that have been established and quarreling for hundreds of years. Game of Thrones is an appropriate comparison. \\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t come into Fate/Zero with the expectation of constant fights and action. Though there are a slew of nicely choreographed and beautifully animated fights, the backbone of the show is honestly the politics and themes; only one servant is defeated by the end of the season and most of  episode eleven is literally servants talking about what it means to be a king. If these topics are unappealing, Fate/Zero is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not to say that the show has no fights and lighthearted moments in the first season. Waver and his relationship with Rider is often used for comic relief, and though it is blatant, it is enjoyable and their bond ends up being a highlight of the show. The fights are intense and beautiful; the two involving Saber and Lancer stand out especially due to Lancer\u2019s mesmerising spearmanship, Saber\u2019s everything, and the palpable sexual tension between the two.\\n\\n\r\nUfotable went above and beyond the call of duty with the animation. The character designs are harmonious and appropriate to each character. And though the show\u2019s style features rather amorphous faces, emotion is conveyed scarily well. The music is composed by Yuki Kajiura of Madoka Magica fame, and is equally epic.\\n\\n\r\nWatch the show subbed. Most of the performances in the english dub are uninspired, though it is not the worst dub ever made. It\u2019s strange, because all of the english voices are actually matched rather well. I can only imagine how amazing the dub could have been in the hands of the right ADR director. In contrast, the Japanese cast yielded sound performances with appropriate amounts of emotion. Lancer definitely caught my attention; his voice has a warrior\u2019s strength but is tinged with sadness. Seems like that would be a hard balance to maintain, but he is absolutely perfect and heartbreaking from the start.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season of Fate/Zero primarily provides setup for the second. However, the ideals, politics and moral ambiguity displayed make it just as entertaining. The first episode is long and exposition heavy and some may find the show confusing at first, but stick with it, as it gets less so through the course of the show (and consequent rewatches).\\n",

            "content": "I've just reviewed the Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya. Like I said there, talking about the Fate series is like talking about Mercedes-Benz: it has the quality, prowess, elegance, and legacy.\r\nSo to reiterate, if Fate/Stay Night (2006) is like the Mercedes-Benz 300SL [to those who haven't read my Prisma Illya review, the 300SL is the car that Irisviel has], and Fate/Zero is the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG, and then the Prisma Illya is the Mercedes-AMG-GT.\r\nI've discussed the analogy matter of Prisma-Illya and Mercedes AMG-GT, so now we're going for the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG: the true Mercedes-Benz.\r\nTrue to the intention of Fate/Stay Night of showing what and how the HolyGrail War should be. Yes, I've played the original Visual Novel of Fate/Stay Night, the only VN I've ever played and finished, so I'm as oriented as any self-sustaining FATE-otaku a little too much that I actually know one.\\n\r\nFrom what I can say, this is truly the Fate series' intention. Type-Moon made no mistake of handling Urobuchi the rights to create Fate/Stay Night's prequel.\\n\r\nIf Type-Moon is Mercedes-Benz, then it's like them commanding AMG in truly assembling their finest Engineers to create the SLS-AMG.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 10\\n\r\nThe story in a nutshell, takes the event of the 4th Holy Grail War, which is 10 years prior to Fate/Stay Night's 5th Holy Grail War. Einzbern and Tohsaka family, and Makiri, and other Magi who are fit to be contenders come face to face with each other as Masters with Servants to battle for the ultimate Holy Grail. The pace of the action on Fate/Zero is as brutal as how the SLS-AMG accelerates.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10\\n\r\nThis really makes what Fate/Zero the SLS-AMG of the metaphor/analogy. Urobuchi certainly didn't write this light novel overnight, he thought this over and over, creating phantasms for the dynamics and voids for the complexities, flawed characters to the plot, and distorted plot to the characters. From Kiritsugu Emiya to Kotomine Kirei, each and every character is well-thought of, it's like each Mercedes-AMG engineer is tasked solely for the SLS-AMG's chassis, for the body, for the engine, roof, and every component.\\n\r\nLiterally, this is how a novel intertwines with the plot and character needs to be made.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 10\\n\r\nFate series have nailed this since 2004, better yet--as far as Tsukihime is concerned. There's just no denying that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\r\nIn Prisma-Illya, we're missing Yuki Kajiura. It's because for the Fate/Zero to sound like the SLS-AMG having the precise sound of of the 6.0liter M159 V8 AMG engine, it needs to have Yuki Kajiura; as well as the renowned, entirely recognized seiyuus: Ayako Kawasumi voicing Saber; Rikiya Koyama voicing Kiritsugu, the bad-ass voiced Nakata Jouji as Kotomiya Kirei, Seki Tomokazu voicing Gilgamesh, Midorikawa Hikaru voicing Lancer, Ohara Sayaka voicing Irisviel, Daisuke Namikawa voicing Waver; and a couple of supporting cameos by Kana Ueda and Mai Kadowaki.\\n\r\nThe feeling upon hearing all this will grumble on your heart and manifest on your soul.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\r\nBetter than Fate/Stay Night, no doubt. Mercedes-Benz should have nicknamed their SLS-AMG as \"Saber\" to commemorate Fate/Zero. After all, Gen Urobuchi made a cameo-feature for the Mercedes-Benz 300SL as Irisviel's sports coupe. But that's okay, because the SLS-AMG has undoubtedly been Mercedes-AMG's Holy Grail.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10\\n\r\nOne of the finest anime there is to be watched, and this review will extend towards season 2, because reviewing Fate/Zero's season 2 is just like reviewing the SLS-AMG BLACK. The season 2 is just as auspicious as that.\\n\r\nI won't say anything further, because trying to describe more of the overall quality of Fate/Zero is like defining what \"outstanding\" is, what \"Magnum-opus\" means, and what is it like to see a masterpiece.\\n\r\nTruly, Fate/Zero (and its season 2) is a class of its own.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Certainly, Fate/Zero is the SLS-AMG of the anime realm, equivalent to the charm of Saber, the beauty of Irisviel, and the legacy of the Holy Grail War.",

He who is worthy of all heroes\u2019 envy, and he who leads their way, is king! Therefore, the king is not alone. For his will equals that of all his followers together!\"  - Rider (Fate/Zero)\r\nHonestly I was very apprehensive when starting Fate/Zero. I didn't know what to expect from it but what I got was a great surprise. \r\nStory: The story of Fate/Zero is this, several big families pick a representative to fight for them in the 4th grail war so they can get a wish. Themain protagonist, Kiritsugu Emiya, is a hardened assassin who was chosen by the Einzbern family to represent them. He is paired with the servant Saber (the strongest class.) I don't want to say much more for I fear I'll spoil the story which is something you have to experience. It has a very grim atmosphere and it doesn't pull any punches, which you'll see with the Caster character when he's introduced. The ending is one of my favorites in recent history because of how dark it is. It's extremely well adapted from the light novels. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I think this is one of the strongest points of the series, the gorgeous animation and art. Sure some frames don't look amazing but that goes for practically all anime. I enjoy the rather pale and dark colors used for the scenery and the characters, it represents the tone of the story quite well. The animation is absolutely gorgeous, even the 3D parts which was something I was rather skeptical about. Berserker's jet fight with Gilgamesh illustrates how great the animation really is. Ufotable really went all out with this one. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack for all the Fate series is amazing. Zero really stands out because it probably has one of my favorite ending songs in anime history, Manten. It's a really powerful song that plays at the end of episode 18, keep an eye out for it. The orchestrated tracks bring a lot of tension into the larger fights and make them even more entertaining to watch. Trust me, you'll be listening to this OST after you finish the anime. It's THAT good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Quite possibly my favorite part of the series is the characters. Oh god do I love 90% of them. Rider, Kiritsugu and Kirei are probably the ones that stuck out the most to me. Rider's powerful and charismatic personality matches perfectly up against his master, Waver's, geeky and angsty personality. Rider is also extremely lovable and goofy at times so he's a treat to watch. But he really isn't just a generic meathead, he says some extremely powerful things as well. Kiritsugu's backstory, which they dedicate 2 episodes to portraying, is gripping and sad. His actions are questionable as well which makes him entertaining to watch because you don't know if you're rooting for him or not. He has good intentions but poor execution. Kirei is similar, Kirei doesn't exactly know what he wants when the anime starts but once he meets Gilgamesh, things change immensely for him. Kirei and Kiritsugu take similar paths and are similar people with different motivations, that's what makes them so interesting. Saber would probably be the only character I wasn't quite into, she's pretty bland. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This was an absolute blast to watch, the fights are great, the dialogue is great and the animation is STUNNING. Watch it then move on to the ufotable version of Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works. You should definitely give the visual novels a try too because you'll miss out on a lot of wacky Kirei antics.",

            "content": "Note: this is a review of both seasons of Fate/Zero, seeing as it's a singular story that was split into two seasons for reasons not related to the plot.\r\nSince the dawn of mankind, humans have been creating stories. Many of these stories centred around lives and adventures of special individuals or groups of people, legendary larger-than-life heroes who performed superhuman feats on a regular basis, defied the Gods and odds and boldly looked Death itself right in the eye. Both Gods and Fate toyed cruelly with many of these heroes, either for the sake of their own amusement or because these legendary individuals dared tooppose or challenge their divine will. Their heroic deeds, whether real or fictional, made them famous for all eternity.\\n\r\nThousands of years ago, it was the brave Achilies, a warrior who brought down the armies of the famous city of Troy. It was the cunning Odysseus, who managed to outwit the capricious Gods of Olympus and overcome their ploys to keep him away from home. Later it was King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, whose fame and glory are probably unparalleled in the realm of legends. Today we have numerous comic-book superheroes, from the demigod Superman to the rich self-righteous vigilante Bruce Wayne, as well as the more \u201ctraditional\u201c heroes like Aragorn from Lord of the Rings. Each era has its own heroes.\\n\r\nHowever, much like in the world of Miguel de Cervantes' literary classic, \u201cDon Quixote\u201c,  the modern world is no longer a place for heroes of old. Concepts of honour and chivalry have yielded to the growing cynicism and opportunism, and the ends justify the means for most people today. I wouldn't say it's a bad thing per se, but it ( unfortunately ) results in people largely dismissing or even ridiculing any attempts at display of heroism or nobleness. However, while there might not be a place for them in the real world, heroes are still very much alive and kicking in the realm of fiction. Fate/Zero is a work that connects both those worlds.\\n\\n\r\nAn adaptation of the novel of the same name, Fate/Zero is a prequel to the widely popular visual novel Fate/ Stay Night which spawned an anime adaptation of its own back in 2006. Studio DEEN's take on the original game was... not that well received by the fans, and the series didn't do much to bring more fans to the Fate franchise. It's been described as \u201cjuvenile\u201c, \u201cmediocre\u201d, \u201coverhyped\u201c etc. The fans were eager to see their beloved game come to life as an anime series, but were largely let down by it, and the hype they created prior to the series' release considerably raised the expectations of the uninitiated, which in turn caused many of them to be just as disappointed. Seeing how dissatisfied the fans were with the Fate/Stay Night anime by DEEN, Type-Moon, the developer of the game, decided to collaborate with a different studio for the adaptation of the Fate/Zero novel \u2013 Ufotable, who already had an established relationship with the company and a good record of adapting their works into anime with their series of Kara no Kyoukai movies. Comparing this series to its sequel, I can safely say that, from the technical aspect at least, the decision by Type-Moon to bring Ufotable on board for this project was an act of Providence.\\n\\n\r\nMade with a budget that can buy a small country, Fate/Zero boasts visuals of near-cinematic quality that greatly enhance the feeling set by the story that this series is something else, and not just your typical run-of-the-mill supernatural action shonen show. From character designs and backgrounds to spectacular fight scenes, Fate/Zero is a feast for the eyes. Whether hand-drawn or CGI-rendered, the backgrounds are all highly detailed and blend in with the character models perfectly. Breathtaking backdrops range from a majestic castle of the Einzbern family in the German Alps to the futuristic cityscape of Fuyuki City, the battleground of the Fourth Holy Grail War. Lavishly decorated halls and drawing rooms, cellars corroded by moist, neon-lit city avenues and thick forests shrouded in mist serve as arenas for the spectacular battles between the greatest heroes of History. \\n\r\nThe colour palette is as diverse as the set pieces, but leans more towards the darker tones and colder colours, seeing as most of the battles take place at night ( which is perfectly logical as the whole tournament is supposed to be highly secret ). Black, blue and gold are the most dominant ones, but no colour gets neglected and almost each character is colour-coded for your convenience. Gold as the symbol of royalty and power; blue for calmness and coldness; black as the colour of mystery, sadness, death and evil; white, the colour of purity, simplicity and innocence, red for energy, passion and war \u2013 the use of colours goes beyond mere aesthetics as each is assigned to a character in accordance to their personality.\\n\r\nThe character designs themselves might seem typically \u201canime\u201c at first glance ( large eyes, bright hair colours etc. ), but a second look reveals a plethora of rich designs with a lot of attention payed to detail and harmony. Heroic Spirits are naturally very distinctive, particularly Archer, Rider and Saber, featuring a range of impressive outfits and weaponry. For the fans of the franchise: there is a marked improvement in the designs of recurring characters from Fate/Stay Night, most notably Saber, who leaves a much more regal and knightly impression in this incarnation, and these improvements aren't just budget-related \u2013 Ufotable simply has better artists. Their Masters, as well as other human characters, are right behind them, sporting some nice and distinctive outfits, and there really isn't a single character whose design could be considered dull or boring.\\n\\n\r\nAs gorgeous and eye-catching as the artwork is, though, the real testament to Ufotable's dedication to this project, and a shameless display of their gargantuan budget for the series is the animation. Not only are all the fight scenes beautifully choreographed and a joy to watch, they are complemented by animation of cinematic quality with absolutely no shortcuts taken. Forget about speed lines or sword-flashes on a black background - Fate/Zero features battles that could give most Hollywood blockbusters a run for their money. Be it one-on-one duels or massive free-for-all brawls, the action in Fate/Zero is a thrilling spectacle that will not disappoint those who're in just for some awesome fight scenes. CG animation is widely used and, thankfully, blends extremely well with the 2D artwork for the most time, allowing for some excellent gimmicks, effects and set pieces that would otherwise be extremely difficult to pull off.\\n\r\nHowever, while undoubtedly great and high-end, the animation isn't 100% perfect. The CG models are painfully obvious on a few occasions, but it's really only just a few. Also, while the action scenes can make your jaw drop and the studio makes sure you see that they saved no expenses on them, outside the fight-scenes and a few chases, it is clear that this is still a TV series, no matter how high the budget is. There is plenty of dialogue and exposition in the series, and these scenes play out with minimal changes of camera angles and the person talking is often either off-screen or far away, so as to eliminate lip-flaps where possible.\\n\r\nIn the end, while a few corners had to be cut, the cuts were placed wisely and where they felt natural, and all these issues with the visuals are really minor, bordering on nit-picking. \\n\\n\r\nBut as always, what is a visually impressive show worth without an equally impressive soundtrack? Well, a lot, but a great score raises the viewing experience to a whole new level. The composer brought on board for this tour-de-force of a story is Yuki Kajiura, one of the greatest composers in contemporary anime industry whose vast opus includes the soundtracks for .hack franchise, Kara no Kyoukai movies, Tsubasa Chronicles, Sword Art Online and Madoka Magica. While I wouldn't say it's her best, the score for Fate/Zero is certainly one of the most powerful works she composed. \\n\r\nMusic is probably the most subjective thing in the world, almost completely subject to personal preferences. However, I think there are two criteria by which you can easily assert whether a soundtrack is good or not \u2013 if it makes you cry and/or gives you goosebumps. There are only a few tracks that could bring tears to your eyes, but the number of times the music will give you shivers more than makes up for this. To complement the nature of the story and the grand size of some of the battles, Kajiura brings us a score full of epic choirs that make your heart race and give the entire series an epic feel during the high points, and make the already intense and dynamic action scenes even more engaging. Haunting female choruses are accompanied either by an orchestra or electronic instruments or both, and this blend of modern and \u201cclassical\u201c music does wonders for setting the tone and pace for each scene. There aren't really any stand-out pieces, but they are all excellent and don't lose any of the quality or impact if you listen to them on their own.\\n\r\nWhen it comes to opening and ending tunes, Fate/Zero is quite diverse. Since the series is split into two seasons, there are two pairs of opening and ending themes, both of which are pretty good, especially the Season 1 ending theme song, \u201cMemoria\u201c, and Season 2 opening theme \u201cTo the Beginning\u201c by Kalafina. Season 2 has another track by Kalafina, named \u201cMaten\u201c and featured in ep 18 & 19, which is... well... sung by Kalafina! Listen to it, it's great, even if it's sad.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of voice-acting, the series hasn't received an English dub as of yet, but if it does this review will be updated. However, the Japanese dub is so good and distinctive that it most definitely warrants a comment. Koyama Rikiya delivers a powerful and impressive delivery as Emiya Kiritsugu, keeping a cool and emotionless voice for the most part, while still successfully portraying many different emotions that occasionally slip through his cold exterior. His main opponent, Kotomine Kirei, is voiced by Nakata Jouji, probably best known for his role as the vampire Alucard from Hellsing. His deep and mighty voice is a joy to listen to; at the same time both fitting for the character's personality and in contrast to his more youthful exterior. But while both these two, as well as Kawasumi Ayako as Saber, do a brilliant job at portraying their respective characters, it is Ootsuka Akio ( Batou from GITS franchise ) as Rider that delivers the most powerful and striking performance, intensifying the qualities of his character several times. The sheer impact of his performance is hard to describe \u2013 simply put, without Ootsuka, there is no Rider. Honorable mention goes to Satoshi Tsuruoka as Caster; you can tell in every line he utters that the man is having an incredible amount of fun, and has no qualms about going way over the top with his insane overacting. He's a lot of fun to listen to and when the series is dubbed they should cast Jeremy Irons for this role.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith the technical aspects of the series out of the way, let's have a look at the story. \\n\r\nThe word \u201cepic\u201c has lost a lot of its former weight in the modern Internet generation. Today, anything more entertaining than a dog using a laptop or a cat stuck in a jar can be dubbed \u201cepic\u201c, which results in people largely forgetting what the word originally stood for. It is therefore quite refreshing to see something that really earns the title of an epic. If the inclusion of heroes and legends of old in a tournament for the Holy Grail, and the mentioning of grand and spectacular battles didn't tip you off already, then the themes and ideas presented and debated over the course of the series should illustrate why Fate/Zero is an epic.\\n\r\nPossibly inspired by the ( annoying ) personality and actions of Emiya Shirou, the protagonist of Fate/ Stay Night, the basic idea and main underpinning theme of Fate/Zero is the concept of chivalry and honour and the question of what it really means to be a hero. Selfless heroes are no strangers to movies and books, and they are very much a hallmark of shonen action anime. Noble individuals who never hesitate to sacrifice themselves for the cause; determinators who rarely, if ever, doubt their ideals; goody two-shoes who always endeavour to do the right thing and so on and so on... Perhaps it's needless to say that most of these heroes are rewarded for their goodness in the end and they manage to achieve their goals fully. \\n\r\nBut this series was written by Gen Urobuchi. \\n\r\nAs the question it poses suggests, Fate/Zero is a deconstruction of sorts of the shonen anime, but it also goes way beyond that in many questions it asks. There are very, very few examples in anime industry ( and I dare say, Hollywood as well! ) of writers that ask the tough questions as cuttingly as Urobuchi does. What makes a hero a hero? What would it take to be a hero of justice? What does it mean and take to stay true to one's own ideals? Are they even worth it? The maturity of the writing and the genius of Urobuchi's storytelling is that the show never pretends to hold any definite and universal answers to these questions. True, he\u2019s better at asking the questions than answering them, but there\u2019s a very good reason for that \u2013 I don\u2019t think Urobuchi believes there *are* any answers to be had, seeing as he is more or less a Nihilist with a healthy twist of despair. Various viewpoints and ideas are presented by a number of different characters, and each of their beliefs holds both something true and misguided at the same time, and the ratio differs from character to character and is also largely open to perspectives and judgements of both the characters and viewers. Urobuchi doesn't treat any of the views as inherently right or wrong, or one morally superior to the others, which provides for some great food for thought for those who wish to entertain themselves with some brain work, while not offending or alienating anyone with his personal views and opinions.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is tight and very well written, full of twist and turns. Granted, they aren't really on the same level as Death Note, the King of Twists, but it does stand apart from almost every other action show barring  maybe Code Geass. Rather than simply throwing the characters into as many fights as possible and resorting to cheap power-up cop-outs when the situation becomes too thick, Fate/Zero dedicates a lot of time to careful planning and strategy, especially in the first half of the story. A battle royale to end all battle royales, it features some quite diabolic schemes, clever stratagems and a lot of conspiracies. Temporary alliances are often created, but more out of necessity or common threat rather than goodwill or nobility. To tell the truth, compared to the elaborate planning of each next move and a hefty amount of character interaction, the fight scenes are very much not at the forefront of the story. Sure, the battles are mesmerizing, but are spread thinly throughout the series, with the natural exception of the grand conclusion. This sets the show apart from its shonen brethren and makes it a much more \u201cintellectual\u201c story than a strictly action-packed thrill-ride. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, as rich in substance and breathtaking in scope as it is, Fate/Zero's story does suffer from some flaws in presentation; the storytelling itself. \\n\r\nThe pacing is very uneven, and reminded me a bit of Mamoru Oshii's directional style \u2013 there's a ( relatively ) small number of intense action scenes separated by long periods with very little action or plot twists, mostly dominated by long and in-depth dialogue. The amount of dialogue is enormous and can take a strain on the viewer, so it's extremely fortunate that the dialogue itself is engaging and interesting in its own right, otherwise the show would have lost its audience. There are a few occasions when an interaction between characters seems forced or tedious, but it's really rare and doesn't detract from the overall quality of the writing. I doesn't bother me if there's endless talking as long as the dialogue is meaningful and relevant to the story and character development, which is all true for Fate/Zero.\\n\r\nApart from the somewhat awkward pacing and a hefty amount of talking, there is one other problem with the writing. Well, one and a half to be precise. Although it's a prequel to the already popular Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Zero attempts to bring in more fans and thus appeal to the newbies of the franchise. For this purpose, most of the double-length first episode is one big and not very subtle exposition dump on the backstory of the Holy Grail War and the workings of the story's universe. While it can unnerve many an older fan of the Fate series, as someone who was completely ignorant about the franchise I found it to be pretty useful and didn't have any major issues with it ( and I usually abhor force-fed exposition! ). All things considering, the exposition dump was handled rather well, and the decision by the writers to include it in the anime adaptation was a good one. \\n\r\nLess excusable is the episode 10, which revolves around a certain side character that plays a major role in Fate/Stay Night. This episode baffled many a fan, for it doesn't really follow any of the main plot threads and has almost no bearing to the overall plot progression. It seems to be a rather forced attempt at giving some characters much needed screen time and tying things up for the series' sequel. Yes, it's practically filler.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo tell a good story, you need an interesting plot. To tell a great story, you also need a great cast of characters, and this is where Fate/Zero shines the brightest.\\n\r\nI'm not trying to demote the show's other strengths, but I found the characters and their interactions to be the most interesting aspect of the series, partly because this is an intensely character-driven story. Each of the main characters could warrant a lecture and an essay on their own, but since the review is already long as it is and since it would inevitably include some spoilers, I'll try to keep it general and speak in broad strokes.\\n\r\nThe seven Mages, called the Masters, are all quite interesting and memorable characters in their own right. The seven Servants are maybe even more interesting \u2013 who wouldn't want to meet a legendary hero and see what they were really like? Watching the Masters and their Servants interact with each other and seeing how their ( differing ) approaches to winning the war affect their relationships is incredibly enjoyable and engaging. Some of them are kindred spirits that immediately create a strong bond between them while others get to know and connect with each other more gradually. Some downright despise each other while others develop more one-sided love or hate relationships. Then there's the interactions between members of opposing teams and all the rivalry and confrontation that the Holy Grail War brings with it, all of them displaying Urobuchi's more than formidable qualities as a writer. \\n\r\nBoth the Masters and their Servants are primarily defined by their ideals and motivations, which dictate their actions over the course of the story and drive it forward, sometimes in ways you could never have predicted at the outset. They can range from chivalric knights, willing to die for their honour, to the troubled and cynical pragmatists, to incredibly pompous and conceited arrogant douchebags.\\n\r\nSome characters develop and change more over the course of the story than the others, and some inevitably get more screentime and development than the rest, but no one is left unchanged by the War in which they participate, cementing the feeling that this is an event of proportion and importance.\\n\r\nThe pinnacle of the interactions between the members of the cast has to be the \u201cBanquet of Kings\u201c in ep 11, a brazen and unapologetic philosophical debate that, through a more specific theme of kingship, set in its sights the entire world and mankind\u2019s role in it. It is not often that you get to see such a brilliant take on philosophy that manages to overcome elitism or pretentiousness usually fettering such discussions, because it was incredibly direct, natural, pointed and free of BS. Seriously, they should show that episode in university courses for years to come.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of character development for which I have to praise the writers has to be just how well researched the backstories of the Heroic Spirits are. Archer's, Lancer's, Rider's and Caster's stories stand out in particular, tying a lot of elements from their legends into their character development during the story, including some very inconspicuous details that can just fly over your head if you're not familiar with their stories. Wikipedia is your friend if you don't want to miss them. \\n\r\nCertainly, the writer took many liberties with the original legends ( Saber being a prime example ), but the effort put into researching the originals, as well as all those details and little things that can go unnoticed, show that these liberties don't stem from ignorance. Rather, one should view the changes made as Artistic License or intentional disregard.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, while Fate/Zero fields a stellar cast of almost Shakespearean characters that only a few other shows ( like Baccano! ) could match, not all the characters are perfectly shaped or used.\\n\r\nThe sheer size of the cast makes it clear that not everyone can get the same amount of development, and that some take more spotlight than others, but there are still some characters that I feel are underused and even squandered, not achieving the potential they had. Namely, it's Matou Kariya and his servant, Berserker. That doesn't mean that they are plain or ineffectual, far from it, but I would have preferred had they played a larger role in the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to probably the most important part of the story, and the one that ultimately sealed Fate/Zero's fate and final score \u2013 the ending. This part might contain some minor, minor spoilers, but I think it might be better for you if you watch the series emotionally prepared.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nNo matter how brilliant Gen Urobuchi is as a writer, no matter how amazing the story he created is, and no matter how great of an addition it is to the franchise, there is one giant flaw that cannot be overlooked, and it's the one that prevented it from being a masterpiece it could have been. That flaw is the unfortunate shackle to the Fate series itself. In the end I think Fate/Zero couldn\u2019t escape the prison of Fate/Stay Night.  . Whatever else Urobuchi wanted to do with this story and these characters, he had to point them all at a very specific place and deliver them as advertised. \\n\r\nThe ending itself is handled very well, tying up some of the plot threads and leaving some loose ones for the preexisting sequel to tie up. As a prequel, Fate/Zero does the job perfectly and even improves some aspects of Fate/Stay Night, so I have no complaints about that. As a stand-alone work, though, it fails to achieve perfection it strives for, and not due to any fault of its writer or the production crew.\\n\r\nUrobuchi had a misfortune of having his hands tied by an obligation to tie his story to a preexisting one. This severely limited the boundaries of his artistic expression, and it was very obvious during the final episode that his hand was forced and that he wouldn't have ended the story quite that way if it was completely up to him. It's still very much a Urobuchi ending, but no the one I think he really would have wanted to create. \\n\\n\r\nTo look for conventional character arcs with conventional satisfactions in an Urobuchi series is asking for disappointment.  Heroes aren\u2019t rewarded and villains punished because the universe doesn\u2019t recognize heroes and villains \u2013 only those with power and conviction and those without it.  That\u2019s why his series don\u2019t tend to emotionally satisfy in the end so much as leave you dazed and bleeding by the side of the road. Existence is suffering \u2013 that\u2019s Urobuchi\u2019s fundamental truth. However, a quick glance at the series\u2019 ending and a comparison with his other great work, Madoka Magica, in which he was free to do as he pleases, shows that Urobuchi knows that a good tragedy needs purpose. A good tragedy must be inspiring, not depressing. He won\u2019t give you anything more than simple final hope, but it is that hope that gives meaning to all the darkness and suffering prior to it. He gives a bit of it at the ending of Fate/Zero too, but it\u2019s not really the same fulfilling kind of hope from Madoka, and the series thus strikes me as incomplete and imperfect.\\n\\n\r\nBy the fall of the curtain in final episode, almost all of the character arcs have been concluded. The dead are...well, dead, and the survivors have gone through a defining change, especially the two main human characters, Kiritsugu and Kirei. While Kirei\u2019s story continues in Fate/Stay Night, his character arc and gradual transformation in Fate/Zero is definitely concluded. Kiritsugu\u2019s story also reaches a final conclusion, and a satisfying one at that. Gilgamesh, another character from Fate/ Stay Night, remains more or less unchanged over the course of the series, quite naturally seeing as he is the Eldest Hero and an individual who affects and changes others. His adventures shall continue, but his part in this story has also effectively concluded.\\n\\n\r\nBut there is one major character whose arc is left unfinished, the only one who is yet to see the conclusion of their story. I am talking about Saber, the heroine of both series and one of the most iconic female characters in anime. She and her Master, Kiritsugu, are the Tragic Heroes of the story, the ones who get to see their ideals and hopes shattered before their very eyes. Both are driven to the point of despair because of their ideals and how their ideals betray them in the end. However, only Kiritsugu gets a conclusion to his story. His character is redeemed and his path completed, whereas Saber\u2019s is not. Her character development takes the route of \u201cBreaking the Heroine\u201c, but she is left only halfway through, in the depths of her despair, and without either a positive or negative resolution. This incompleteness of her character arc is the proof of a shackle that tied Urobuchi's hands. A writer like him wouldn't have left a character's arc unfinished, but was in this case forced to do so, since Saber's arc spans Fate/ Stay Night as well, and is only concluded at the end of that series. \\n\r\nBeing a Hero of Justice is never a good thing in a story by Urobuchi, but even though he broke Saber completely in his novel, even though he uncompromisingly smashed her ideals, he never spits on them or finds them morally inferior to either Kiritsugu's or Kirei's. Even though he stated that Kirei and Gilgamesh were his favourite characters in the story, I think that he is much more like Kiritsugu then Kirei, and I cannot but see his sadistic handling of her character development as anything other than a defence mechanism of a man who cannot help himself but adore and hate such idealistic heroes at the same time. I believe he, too, wanted to be a Hero of Justice.\\n\r\nWhile Urobichi is a bit too cynical and depressed to do so, the writers of the anime did slightly redeem her character at the end of the series although only slightly. Even though he would never say it himself, I believe that Urobuchi wanted to give Saber the same words as a certain character in episode 25. His redemption of Saber\u2019s spiritual successor, Miki Sayaka, at the end of Madoka Magica makes me think so.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end most of the satisfaction you\u2019ll get comes from Rider and his master, Waver, who were the leading lights of hope in a hopeless universe.  People can change \u2013 and not in the way Kirei changes, or because of limitless suffering (caused and felt) as in Kiritsugu\u2019s case.  They changed because of their relationship with each other, and for the better at that.  And it\u2019s no coincidence, I think, that as characters they didn\u2019t carry the heavy burden of having to confirm to their Fate/ SN archetypes.  They could simply *be*, and exist fully as Urobuchi imagined them. And in doing so, perhaps they reveal that Urobuchi hasn\u2019t completely given himself over to hopelessness and despair.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nFinally, time for me to conclude the review. Both the fans of Fate/Stay Night and those not familiar with the franchise can enjoy Fate/Zero, each in a different way. If you saw F/SN and found it underwhelming, the vast difference in scope and quality between the two series will be very refreshing for you, and seeing how F/Z puts pieces into places left empty by its sequel will be a rewarding experience. The uninitiated, on the other hand, can enjoy the uncertainty and suspense of the series that is largely lost to those who have seen F/SN ( since they already know who lives to fight another day ). \\n\r\nDespite its flaws, Fate/Zero is an excellent series. Minor problems like the pacing could have easily been forgiven, but the unfulfilling and anti-climactic ending stripped it of a perfect score, which is a great shame, as it's a series of exceptional scope and potential - the unfortunate shackle imposed by its preexisting sequel prevented it from becoming a masterpiece that it could have been. \\n\r\nNothing Gen Urobuchi does is ever less than fascinating, and Fate/Zero is no exception.- its story, characters, animation, soundtrack and sheer scope and enjoyability give it such a wide appeal I can recommend it to almost anyone. A series of such impact and quality only comes about once in a while and really should not be missed. \\n\r\nI can say with much certainty that it is one of the greatest series I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\r\n8,8/10.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fate/Zero had some big shoes to fill. Based on a series of light novels that serve as a prequel to one of the most beloved visual novels of all time, animated by Studio ufotable \u2013 which has proven itself deft at adapting Type-Moon material with their fine work on Kara no Kyoukai \u2013 and with a soundtrack composed by none other than Yuki Kajiura; it's no surprise that fans were ecstatic in their anticipation. Hype is of course a dangerous thing, known to backlash horribly when it spins out of control.\r\nWhich makes it a relief that Fate/Zero is quite good. Great, even.\r\nFor the uninitiated: Fate/Zerois an urban fantasy action series set in the fictional Japanese city of Fuyuki. A modern day setting where magecraft exists and is acknowledged. The story chronicles the first half of an event called the 4th Holy Grail War: a contest of elimination where seven mages (dubbed 'Masters') each summon an ancient spirit (dubbed  'Servants') into the physical realm with the objective of fighting other contestants until only one remains. The winner is allowed access to the Holy Grail: an artifact of incredible power said to be capable of granting any wish. \\n\\n\r\nIt is within the Holy Grail War that we follow a wide range of characters: seven Masters, seven Servants as well as a number of supporting characters, most of whom with a connection to the Masters, be it spouse, mentor or assistant. The show handles its large cast of characters remarkably well: there's a lot of diversity and complexity in the personalities, motivations, designs and abilities showcased. Furthermore, the characters feel human: meaning that they can sometimes do terrible or stupid things, but there's always an idea of where they're coming from. This is because of solid world building in the earlier episodes where it's shown that the mage culture is highly elitist and traditional. Especially emphasized is the treatment of women: they're seen as little more than tools to produce heirs, and arranged marriages are very common. Some might view this as misogynistic, but the show does not glorify or endorse these practices in the slightest, though some women are happier in the circumstances than others. \\n\\n\r\nThe great characters inhabit an equally stellar narrative. Magic battles and Highlander-esque contests of elimination are certainly nothing new, but the plot twists tired conventions in clever and often brutal ways. Noteworthy is how Fate/Zero handles the action. Battles are not won by believing in your friends or having willpower, instead victory is snatched from the jaws of defeat through planning, cunning and intelligent use of one's abilities and resources. Kiritsugu Emiya, protagonist and anti-hero to the core, embodies this; and his stunningly vicious pragmatism \u2013 which masks a sadness of a man who wishes to better the world by any means necessary - is just one of Fate/Zero's many deviations on the usual clich\u00e9s. The storyline and characters work in tandem to create a truly gripping action series. One that drives home a very important point: action scenes get better when characters you care about are in the fight, and you can understand why they're fighting.*\\n\\n\r\nNot everything about the storytelling is wonderful, though. The show ends on a massive cliffhanger  and has no continuation at the time of writing though it is in production. A bigger problem is that there's a lot of exposition in the story's calmer periods. While helpful, it's often delivered in a clunky way. The show is often guilty of something that's referred to as ''As You Know''-dialogue, where one characters reiterates information to another that both of them already know. Moreover, the composition of these scenes is awkward at times. Absolute low point is the first episode in which a Master in training is receiving instructions from 2 people who, while doing so, are walking in circles. One could make a case for how it's supposed to symbolize the fact that they're trying to indoctrinate him, but the whole thing just looks incredibly silly. The saving grace is that the dialogue itself is consistently interesting, be it a discussion about how society defines one's ethics, a character expressing his self-doubt or a Servant's thunderous proclamation of superiority before annihilating an opponent. \\n\\n\r\nThose familiar with ufotable's work on Kara no Kyoukai were confident that they would turn in good work for Fate/Zero, and these hopes weren't in vain. The visuals are of excellent quality across the board. The atmospheric environments and stunning action sequences in particular are a sight to behold. Though there are some visual blemishes in the form of conspicuous CGI here and there, including an entire character rendered in it. This last bit was supposedly an artistic choice on ufotable's part seeing as the character in question is described as feeling fundamentally alien, and while the actual CGI isn't bad but it's definitely not as fluidly animated as the hand-drawn visuals. The soundtrack isn't so extraordinary. Yuki Kajiura isn't quite as diverse as other acclaimed Japanese composers and it doesn't help that she didn't seem to bring her A-game for Fate/Zero. It's not a bad, but nothing that will have people itching to download it. The opening and ending themes, however, are both stellar. \\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero has a lot to like in spite of a few downsides, and it comes together so marvelously that liking it is all the easier. The fascinating characters, gripping plot, wonderful animation and stunning battles make this an easy sell not just to action-junkies or Type-Moon fans, but to anyone craving an intense thrill-ride with a bit of extra bite to it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n* (It's almost sad that it bears mentioning that caring about characters and having a feel for what's at stake for them makes fights better. But hey, 'Gurren Lagann' and 'Baccano!' got away with lacking them so there you have it.)",

Has a bit of strategy, secret agendas and betrayals which interconnect perfectly to make a what i consider a rare gem, a great mature action fantasy drama.\r\nStory: Although i believe the ending is not as bad as some say, it\u2019s clear to most that it\u2019s not on the same level as the rest of the story.\r\nArt: Beautiful job done by studio Ufotable, enjoyable by all and attractive for those who favor great visuals\r\nSound: Pretty great, especially in the epic fightsthe show has to offer\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well developed characters, some more than others, but since it\u2019s a battle royal with so many characters it\u2019s something bound to happen. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great fight scenes with great and diverse characters. Thrilling plot untill the end, making you always want to see more. Has good dramatic and moral moments, some which go make look flawed and unnecessarily dramatic but others which may shock you and make you think\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, great action, great visuals and soundtrack, great characters and overall great story. The ending is pushed back a little bit, because there's a sequel to which the ending must follow.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I remember hearing the title \"Fate/Zero\" in reference to be one of the best anime's to come out in recent years, however this anime didn't have a lot of hype around it like other anime's like SAO, or Attack on Titan just as a couple examples who get mixed reception from time to time, so I figured with this anime kinda being shoved to the side bit and with people claiming it is a near perfect anime that is under appreciated I figured I would see what all the fuss was about.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story follows seven groups of Mages (people that are like wizards) how engagewith one another using their magical abilities and their servants who are legendary heroes from through out history in a battle royale for the holy grail in what is called \"The Holy Grail War\".\\n\\n\r\nImpression:\\n\r\nIf you're not already aware this is supposed to be a prequel to the Fate/Stay Night anime so it pretty much works off of the main concept, actually the first episode is about 40 minutes long and spends all that time just establishing the story and characters which does a pretty good job of kickstarting the series in a very epic manner (if you sit all the way through it).\\n\r\nWatching this is a lot like watching an intense game of chess were all the opponents try to figure out how to subdue one another until the final conclusion, however if you are more into fights and only fights in anime then this might get a little boring as there are some episodes where almost no fighting really happens but when the fights do happen, they really happen, the action and the entire anime in general is very well animated.\\n\r\nThis tends to be a bit of a more mature anime meaning they don't use the typical high school based formula, most of the characters are grown adults and are a little more serious, and there isn't any filler in the series. This show does tend to be a bit edgy at times as it goes into more adult themes like war, vengeance, there is even a serial killer that has a bit of an obsession with the insides of humans who strangely becomes instant BFFs with his servant as a result.\\n\r\nThe only major con that I can name off is the ending for this series were it kinda bridges into \"Fate/Stay Night\" as if it were telling you to watch it which makes sense for a prequel but this anime could have easily stood on it's own and the tones for both shows were a little different for me, I guess you can think of them separately and this can still be an enjoyable anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound managed to add an epic feel to things, though at times I think the sound wasn't very noticeable, however the first opening sequence and even the ending sequence for this anime were very good as they complemented the show very well and kept you wanting to watch more but of course half way through they changed them even though the opening and ending that they used wasn't bad either, this is the sort of dilemma I see in a lot of anime series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nLike I said before a lot of the characters are full grown adults though a lot of them are flawed and even damaged and have their own ambitions and reasons that they want the holy grail which is something that is explored though out the series though some characters don't get a lot of development and are shoved to the side a bit or they are saving the character development for later in the fate/stay night series.\\n\r\nTo start off Kiritsugu Emiya aka the mage killer, who deep down seems to have a bit of a hatred for mages but has a desire to end all wars and will do it by any means necessary, which I kind of respected out of him, though his methods caused him to clash with his servant Saber who he rarely talked to which is strange compared to the other masters and their servants that at least showed some kind of closeness but not these two.\\n\r\nThen there is Saber, the female king of knights. Saber in comparison to a lot of female characters in anime was unique to me because 1. she wasn't a fan service girl and 2. she never really acknowledges herself as a woman or at least she didn't tie her self to any certain gender roles and she simply did what she did best.\\n\r\nNext is Waver, a scrawny boy and Rider the tall muscular servant that Waver summoned. These two are probably the funnest pair of characters to watch as they almost seem like polar opposites, one being a little timid and nerdy and the other having tons of charisma and is never afraid to charge head long into danger, and together they make one of the best duos in anime.\\n\r\nArcher, Archer is kind of a prick, just putting that out there.\\n\r\nOne thing that is fun about some of these characters as that the servants are famous figures from history and they give you some clues as to what they are, some are real some are from myth, it also helps to have had some education in ancient history or a lot of hours of watching the history channel.\\n\\n\r\nSub vs. Dub:\\n\r\nTo get straight to the point, both versions are pretty solid, if you like watching dubs then you are definitely in for a treat if your kinda in the middle you might watch the dub out of necessity, and if you think all english dubs of anime are HERUSY!!! Then the sub is alright and manages to be pretty entertaining, this isn't the sort of anime that is spontaneous in it's dialog, you don't need to feel the words as they are being said all that much in order to under stand what is going on.\\n\r\nWith that being said here is what I thought of them (you can skip this if you want).\\n\r\nFor the most part I liked the Dub better, they had put together a great cast one being Liam O'Brien who didn't have a hugely big part but I have to say this was one of his best performances and further cemented him as one of my favorite voice actors in anime dubs, One character I kinda liked in both Japanese and english was Saber, even though I'm a little more attached to the english saber the Japanese was pretty entertaining during the battles, another was Berserker who sounded so intense in Japanese, as one of the other voices I felt really stood out in Japanese. Other than that I also liked Caster a little better in english as his voice hit a little closer to home in terms of creepiness and the sup prize Johny-young Bosch performance that was his master mainly because in Japanese caster just sounded like some old guy and his master Uryu's voice was kind of annoying. Archer was more of a prick in english and Rider and Waver had the same presence in both languages.\\n\r\nI would like to speak for the other language versions other than Jap/Eng but those dubs are hard to come a crossed.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\r\nI'm giving this one a 9/10 mainly because it was almost perfect but not quite.",

            "content": "\"So the Holy Grail War is a battle of pure ability, where titles and influence mean nothing.\" - Waver Velvet, a Master of the Fourth Holy Grail War.\r\nFate/Zero is undoubtedly one of the finest anime of this age. This timeless anime echoes the deepest desires, fears, and hopes of our human nature.\r\n---Story & Characters---\r\nIf the premise of this story does not intrigue you, I'm not quite sure what would. While its contemporaries presents naive adolescents with seemingly inexplicable powers, this harshly realistic story offers matured adults, each with his own innocent or sinful motives, engaging in thoughtful combat in a death game. Beginning in atranquil, yet faintly mythical, tone, each episode (sans Rin's filler) furthers the storyline and presents to viewers the mentalities of each combatant in exquisite detail.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, in my opinion, solidly cements this anime's intrigue and interest. Presenting a diverse cast, each with his own background, interests in the War, and skill set, we come to empathize with Waver's desire to prove the strength of the younger magic families and sympathize with Kariya in his attempt to save his (presumably) love's daughter from horrific abuse.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the Servants themselves are greatly interesting (why else would they have their own tales?). To see the engaging battles taking place outside of fanfiction crossovers is tremendously enjoyable, and the twists in the legends amusing yet strangely appropriate.\\n\\n\r\n---Art & Sound---\\n\r\nSimply superb. Other reviewers, more competent than I, have already discussed the technicalities of skilfully using CG in anime, the fitting accompanying soundtrack, and others in great detail. It suffices to say that it deserved to win best-of-2011 animation awards across the Web.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero has been an emotional ride from the very start, with its introduction of some very serious characters and background. This anime is truly one of the best of this year.",

            "content": "This is a review of parts 1 and 2 of the series as a whole. Spoiler free.\r\nAs someone who has always enjoyed historical legends and heroic fighters in a fantasy setting I was instantly drawn to look into this series. The base concept of the series is a group of magi summoning heroic spirits of legend to fight for them in a battle royal style fight over a magical item said to grant any wish, The Holy Grail. \r\nThe setting gives way to an abundant amount of possible outcomes and situations for the viewer to experience and enjoy. The tone of the show is instantlyset the moment you begin watching it. It's mature and serious. If you're looking for something lighthearted to watch this wouldn't be it. On the other hand if you're looking for a series that has meaningful character interaction, a powerful story and some well written characters you've come to the right show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story can be heavy at first when starting with an hour long episode, but all of the info is needed to understand everything that's going on. As an English speaker I must admit when I first started the show in Sub I was having a hard time and even dropped it for awhile, but since the English Dub had an excellent cast I chose to go with it instead since the series could be dialog heavy at times. This instantly helped me keep track of everything more easily.\\n\\n\r\nAt first with all the technical information being shot at the viewer it can be a bit overwhelming at first but as you start to settle in and follow along it all starts to click. As stated before the story is what i would describe as \"heavy\". The series has dark tones and themes throughout, dealing with human nature and desire. It has some of the deepest character conflict I've ever seen in a series, as characters struggle with their own personal ideals and beliefs. What really stands out in the series is the constant back and forth between characters and their interactions between one another as these ideals clash with each other.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to the characters. You can have a really good story but with some horrible characters that bring it down completely, but then you can have really good characters with a terrible story that cause you to enjoy the series just from those characters alone. Fate/Zero does have a pretty cut and dry story at its core (Battle Royal style fight for a magical object that can grant a wish), but its the characters who are put into that story's setting and how they interact and their actions that make that story move forward so interesting. The aspects of each character of the series gets explored very well and each one of them has a defining moment in the series. Something special I love about this series is no character is perfect. ALL of them have some kind of flaw like any person would have. This allows for interesting characters that constantly keep you engaged.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the sound quality goes, Yuki Kajiura does a fantastic job on the sound track. The music fits perfectly for this fantasy thriller and the music enhances each scene only to help immerse one's self into Fate/Zero even more. I've found myself going back to listen to the shows OST often just for background music for whatever I may be doing at the time. As far as sound quality goes, the Sub and Dub are both excellent since I have heard them both at this point, but I must say I think if want to give the series a shot as an English speaker I have to say this is one of the few dubs that in some ways surpasses the original Japanese in certain aspects. The emotion the English actors and actress put into this is very clear. Very notably Kari Wahlgren (Saber) and Matthew Mercer (Kiritsugu) do an amazing job at conveying emotions when it really counts, though honestly so does the whole voice cast, those two just deserve a special mention.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation quality is just astonishing. There is -NEVER- any flat colors. The air itself has texture and life, and any CGI blends nearly effortlessly in with the 2D animation. At no point while watching was I ever jarred or became un-immersed because of it. I cannot stress enough about how mind blowing and well done the animation of this series is. Ufotable did an amazing job with it and I have to say that really only anime movies come close to the level of quality this 25 episode series has. Ufotable really knew how to spend the budge they were given for this.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is something that to me is really deserving of words like \"Epic\" or \"Masterpiece\" words that get thrown around too often in my opinion. I enjoyed it so much and it had a good deal of re-watch value, I've always found something new and interesting each time I watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThis series honestly has made an impact on my life in a few ways, and I think mot anime and even non-anime fans should at the very least give it a try.",

            "content": "Ok, so as someone partially familiar with the manga of F/SN, and watched all of FSN, and now F/Z, I have to say, this did not at all feel like Fate to me. \r\nIf you consider for example \"worm girl Sakura,\" this is one of the most disgusting things I've seen! It's basically the notion of a character who is kind of turned into the perfect weapon by virtue of being kind of permeated with like killer worms or something, or so. \r\nPretty much everything in F/Z is about people just going into conflict and fighting and then fighting and then they fight and dueland it just never added anything that the original FSN anime didn't already have. \\n\\n\r\nSaber and Lancer were pretty fun to follow, basically they have a kind of rivalry where each is determined to best the other in battle.  They don't really get too involved in the overall anime. \\n\\n\r\nBut then instead we get Waver and Rider, who are sort of cool I guess but they were the focus of the entire show after awhile, I didn't get to see more about the other masters and servants. Assassin basically I honestly didn't even know was in the show hardly, which I guess is part of the theme, but mostly it becomes almost entirely about just going on a random bit about so and so before bringing it back to some dueling. \\n\\n\r\n The original Fate series had more variety and stuff it seems to and also blended the Holy Grail Wars with dating, romance, and that to quest, whereas Fate/Zero decided to pin everything around the mythos of the Grail, the wars, the conflicts, the \"nature of heroism,\" and kind of turn it into a Philosophy class which is I guess fine in a sense, but even Aristotle probably would not have minded a bit more give and take, ebb and flow, yin and yang to the proceedings (which FSN anime did provide)\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, it was very colorful and flashy and had some cool music so it wasn't un-fun per se but a 5 was about right. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Most of us are at least passingly familiar with Type-Moon's Fate series. For those of you who aren't the basic premise is that there's a holy grail war periodically and a group of people are chosen as masters and have to summon legendary/ historical figures to fight for them in order to obtain their wish from the grail. There have been two major anime series based on the games, the first being Fate/Stay Night and the second being what we're looking at today, Fate/Zero. Although I'll only be going over the first season. One of the strange things about the Fate anime is that they'renot even handled by the same studio. Fate/Stay was done by studio Deen and this one was handled by Ufotable. Why the change? I don't know. Maybe Type-Moon didn't want the studio responsible for Kore wa Zombie desu ka to touch their licence. Which would make perfect sense. I just hope there aren't any continuity issues as a result. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty much the usual for the Fate franchise, the Holy Grail war is approaching, the masters are chosen and they instantly get to work trying to kill each other.The first season never really gets beyond that. Let's start with the faults. Like Durarara, the entire first episode is largely wasted on exposition. I won't lie, it greatly improves after that, but it's still kind of annoying when they waste a whole episode outlining what's happening instead of letting it emerge naturally in the narrative. It also bothers me that they inject tragedy into the past's of several Fate/Stay Night characters. Why? This isn't stuff that was covered in the original Fate/Stay so there's really no point. It's not like any of it helps explain anything about their motivations. A final thing that bothers me is the way it handles the servants' identities. In the original it was kept as a guarded secret since it could reveal their weaknesses. In this one they barely have any tension with it. Most of the servants just introduce themselves very quickly. That being said, I do have some praise for the series. With prequels it's easy to lose any tension since the audience already has a basic idea of what happens, but Ufotable actually manages to keep the tension strong in spite of that. I also really like the ending. It's a cliffhanger, certainly, but it's an effective one. It makes you want to watch the second season to see what happens. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really what make the anime work. There are a few boring ones like Tohsaka or the Assassin and there are some who seem interesting but you don't get enough of to really judge like Kariya and Berserker, who is actually the only servant without his identity revealed in the first season. The majority of the characters, however, are fascinating. The servants tend to be much more interesting but part of what really makes them work is their interactions with the masters. The relationship between master and servant is always interesting to see. Partially because they vary so much and partially because they went out of their way, in most cases, to pick master-servant pairs that would highlight the most interesting aspects of both their personalities. One of the biggest exceptions is Saber. They made her complement Irisviel instead of her master since those two spend so much time together. One thing that kind of bothers me is that they frequently get their history/myths wrong, and no I'm not talking about Saber being a woman. I'm really more bothered by all the glaring inconsistencies involving Alexander the Great (No, that isn't a spoiler. You find out his identity pretty early on.) I understand that they're just using that as a starting point and it's not meant to reflect reality, but it can be pretty disconcerting. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is mostly excellent. The character designs, though not accurate for some of the servants, are really creative. The fight scenes are strong and there are some really good backdrops. That being said, I have some mostly minor issues. The first is that Saber's hair shape-shifts when she's in her armour vs civilian clothes. Her civilian hair isn't long or thick enough for the style she has in her armour. And, while most of the fight scenes are good, some of them are kind of lazy. Particularly the fight between Caster and the duo of Lancer and Saber. \\n\\n\r\nNow we move on to the acting. Most of the actors are really good. Particularly Ishida Akira and Kawasumi Ayako. That being said, there are two exceptions. The first is Tsuruoka Satoshi. His performance is bombastic, overly grandiose and quite grating. Rather like Brian Blessed. The second is Kadowaki Mai, who plays Illyaviel. She's actually pretty funny but her voice is just so annoyingly high-pitched that it makes me glad she doesn't have much of a role. To be fair, her performance works since she's playing a little kid but that doesn't make it less annoying. The music is... I'm hesitant to say epic since it's a rather over-used term, but it is certainly grand. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 4/10. Saber and Irisviel get some pretty homoerotic scenes. Particularly the ones in which Saber refers to herself as Irisviel's knight. \\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, both the good and the bad, my final rating for Fate/Zero season 1 is an 8/10. The character interactions and characters themselves are largely really well done. The story, though nothing new for the franchise, is interesting and the voice acting is largely really well done. When it comes right down to it, the issues it has are minor by comparison.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero introduces a magical battle royale set in an alternate version of our modern world. The Goblet of Fire chooses seven contenders to fight and scheme until only one is left standing. All of the players of this game have a wish that only the Goblet of Fire can grant. With the help of familiars\u2014spirits of warriors from ancient times\u2014, the contestants employ their magic and their alliances to reach the ultimate goal. I wanted to summarize up until this point and provide some background because my main criticism is about one of the familiars. The woman called \u201cSaber\u201d is a warrior from medieval timeswho wields the legendary sword Excalibur. A bit of time after she is summoned, she reveals her true name to be Arthur Pendragon. Yes, she is supposed to be King Arthur\u2019s spirit. Although it\u2019s a spoiler, I can\u2019t ignore this obscenity for my review. Nitpicking historically inaccurate details isn\u2019t one of my hobbies, but since this issue is so prevalent in Fate/Zero, I won\u2019t hold back. Seriously, what the frick were they thinking? King Arthur is not a GIRL, okay? It says \u201cking\u201d in the name, idiots. Oh sure, a woman was the only one strong enough to pull a sword out of a rock. That has to be the stupidest version of the story I\u2019ve ever heard. Forget about feminist propaganda, that is a straight up attack against men and an insult to the legacy of King Arthur. Instead of honoring his name and creating a strong male character for his spirit, why don\u2019t we just draw up a cute girl with a sword that is too heavy for her tiny feminine arms? I understand that anime panders heavily to whichever demographic is most profitable, but the quality of the show doesn\u2019t have to suffer from it. How can I enjoy the amazing fight scenes in Fate-Zero if half of them include a character that shouldn\u2019t even exist? The answer: I can\u2019t because it\u2019s too distracting. For this reason alone I will not be watching season 2, because something tells me that our pure maiden Arthur Pendragon will make it to the end. \\n\\n\r\n2/10 for undermining the glorious masculinity of historical figures, but overall 7/10 for allowing me to jerk off to my favorite knight of the round table.",

No one is pure. And the voice actors make them all sound like awesome battle hardened war heroes. Not to mention the orchestral soundtrack that compliments the fight scenes so well.\r\nThe only reason I give this show a 8/10 is because there's one fight scene atthe end of season 1/beginning of season 2 that took up several episodes and was really weird and boring. It was done mainly with 3d CG animation and looked so out of place since most of the series is done primarily in 2d animation.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero has some of the best fight scenes that I have ever seen in anime.

I mean, you know you've got a great story ahead when the premise is an epic war for the Holy Grail. Then, add to that the fact that each of the characters has their own drives and ambitions for the Grail, plus a dash of flashy magic, and you've certainly got an enthralling story from start to finish.\r\nCharacters: 10 (only because there is no 11 option)\r\nI have never seen a cast of characters this strong in my life.The only show near this quality is FMA:Brotherhood, and that's high praise from me. Even the despicable characters are the kind you love to hate, and even the minor characters have depth. I often found myself saying, \"Huh, the prick has a point.\" That said, two characters that I MUST point out are Waver and Rider. These two are PERFECT. Rider steals every scene he is in, and several times, I found myself wanting to hug the guy, if it wouldn't mean serious back problems after the fact. Waver, on the other hand, is the best example of character growth I've ever witnessed, and as a writer, he is the type of character I STRIVE for.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nEpic choirs. 'Nuff said. Oh, and Crispin Freeman is in this, so there's that.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10\\n\r\nThis animation has two modes: beautifully fluid and \"my eyes! I wasn't ready for this much flashy! I am unworthy!\" I've seen only a handful of animations that could compare, and they were Miyazaki movies, and I still found Fate/Zero's art direction far more awe-inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend this? Yes. This show will have you hanging on the edge of your seat from start to finish, but have a box of tissues nearby. And maybe a punching bag.",

            "content": "Note: This will be a review of both seasons, as I watched both of them in quick succession.\r\nOverview:\r\nWhen it came out, \"Fate/Zero\" set a new standard for battle royale anime, and after watching it, I can easily see why. A prequel to the critically-acclaimed \"Fate/stay night\", \"Fate/Zero\" tells an epic tale about ideals, the horrors of war and how far one will go and what they'll give up to do what has to be done, or at least what they believe has to be done, accompanied by flawless animation, a fantastic soundtrack and incredible characters. It is awesome and I am proud to say Ihad a great time watching it, even if I was reduced to tears by the end.\\n\\n\r\nStory & World (8.5/10):\\n\r\n\"Fate/Zero\" is set in a world where people are capable of studying and using magic, and such people are known as magi. Every sixty years, seven such people become contestants in the Holy Grail War. To compete, each one summons a Heroic Spirit, who are real-life legendary warriors, to aid them in battle. The magi are known as Masters while the spirits are known as Servants, and the seven pairs face off against one another in a tense battle of cat-and-mouse where they have to track down and defeat each other and the last one standing wins the grand prize- the Holy Grail, which is said to have the ability to grant any wish a person desires. One such contestant is Kiritsugu Emiya, a freelancing mercenary infamously known as the \u2018Magus Killer\u2019, who plans to win the Grail so he can \u2018save the world\u2019. To do so, however, he will have to make the ultimate sacrifice.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is certainly interesting, but if you've even heard of \u201cFate/stay night\u201d then you already know how it\u2019s going to end. Very few things will surprise you and you\u2019ll be able to see how it ends from a mile off. There are also quite a few pacing problems, with the middle parts of the series feeling particularly meandering as no battles for ages seem to end with a meaningful victory. It\u2019s not boring by any means you can think of, but for almost half the series, there is very little progression of the main plot, which some people may find annoying. \\n\\n\r\nWhat saves the story is the fascinating focus on ideals. Among the summoned Servants, there are three Kings- King Arthur (reimagined as a young girl named Arturia who any Fate fan will recognize as Type-Moon\u2019s poster girl Saber), Alexander the Great (Iskander) and Gilgamesh. As the three fight, it is not just a clash of swords and wills, but one of ideals, as each one of them has a different view on kingship. Gilgamesh is a selfish king, believing everything is already his, including people. Thus, they can be used according to his whims as he is the source of morality. Iskander is a conqueror who takes what he wants and inspires loyalty through victory. Saber, on the other hand, sees kingship as service to the masses- not the other way around, and that a king needs to essentially give up their life as a person. What Iskander and Gilgamesh see as a life everyone envies, Arturia views as a responsibility and a burden. They're perfect foils for each other, and that is just one of the many connections to be found between the characters, all of which do a great job at saying what the story is trying to say. This makes the story well worth staying for in spite of the pacing issues and predictable ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation (10/10):\\n\r\nVisually, \u201cFate/Zero\u201d is drop-dead gorgeous. I simply LOVE how the series looks. This is easily one of the most visually stunning anime I have seen so far. Ufotable are well-known for their incredibly detailed animation and it is shown to the absolute fullest here. From the characters to the environments to the effects of the various characters\u2019 attacks, every single inch of the series is dripping with impressive detail. This is, without a doubt, one of the show's greatest strengths.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Dialogue (10/10):\\n\r\n\"Fate/Zero\" boasts a fantastic soundtrack provided by the legendary Yuki Kajiura. It fits the tone of the show absolutely perfectly and there's some fantastic diversity to be found. Literally the only thing wrong with it is that it sounds very similar to a lot of her previous scores. This didn't bother me since it was my first experience with her works but for those who are familiar, this could pose a problem. I suppose you could say it works both ways- if you liked her previous soundtracks, you'll like this one, but if you didn't like her previous soundtracks then this isn't going to convince you she's some kind of genius. The voice acting is very good as well, and while I watched and enjoyed the subbed version, I would still definitely recommend the dub in this case. I particularly liked Kari Wahlgren, Bridget Hoffman and Matthew Mercer's performances as Saber, Irisviel and Kiritsugu, respectively. Their voices are really interesting and really fit their respective characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9.5/10):\\n\r\nWhere do I even begin? The Masters and Servants on their own add up to a total of 14 characters, and besides them there are quite a few supporting characters as well. It would probably take me a whole week to go into depth about them all so I'll just keep it simple. The 45-minute opening episode does a good job at establishing the Masters. Since the war is about wishes, each of them is largely defined by their own personal wish. For some, the wishes are petty- i.e., to be recognized by others or simply to own the Grail as treasure. Others, however, are hunting the grail for far more impossible-seeming wishes- wishes that could change the very nature of the world. And their wishes reveal much about their personalities- as do the lengths they are willing to go to gain these wishes. They also do a good job at showing which characters you're meant to like and which you aren't.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters throughout are very interesting but for me, the ones who really stole the show are the main ones; Kiritsugu, his wife Irisviel and their Servant Saber. Even though Iri and Kiritsugu are happily married, they are about as different as two people can possibly be. We have all heard the saying 'the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few', right? But rarely do we see somebody who lets this motto define who they are. Kiritsugu is one of those rare people.  If a dangerous murderer is on an airplane, he won't hesitate to shoot it down (killing all the innocents aboard) instead of risking the killer getting away and causing even more deaths. To him, no sacrifice is too great if it means achieving his ultimate goal, proven by the fact that to gain his wish, he is forced to sacrifice his own wife. He comes off as a sociopath, since he basically reduces war to little more than arithmetic, but he does have a very good reason in the form of an extremely tragic past (two whole episodes are devoted to it).\\n\\n\r\nIri, on the other hand, is the opposite. You see, she is not a human, but a homouculus, created with the sole purpose of becoming the Holy Grail. She has spent her whole life sheltered in a castle and, as a result, is very innocent, sweet, cheerful and carefree- a stark contrast to the broken, cold, pessimistic attitude of her husband. She has lived a really happy life with her husband and daughter and she's literally so kind and selfless that she's willing to give up all of that and her life to save a world she knows next to nothing about. She's exceedingly adorable, but also a very sad character. As Servants are killed, she gradually weakens so that she's unable to dress without considerable effort and the fact that she's still able to remain so calm and cheerful when talking about this is downright heartbreaking. She's a poor, innocent woman with a doomed fate she doesn't deserve, and a character I couldn't help but love despite knowing what was going to happen to her.\\n\\n\r\nBesides them, Saber is a very interesting character. She is the only Servant who actually has to face the mistakes she made when she was alive and slowly realises she wasn't much of a king. The conflict she has with Kiritsugu is also highly compelling, due to their conflicting views about how wars should be fought. Saber wants to make war as clean and honourable as possible while Kiritsugu simply wants for wars not to be fought it in the first place, as he considers the battlefield to be no better than Hell. This leads to them being utterly incapable of functioning together as a team, leading Iri to pose as her Master instead. The fact that Saber and Iri get along really well and Iri and Kiritsugu love each other (however rarely the latter may show it) means the conflict works brilliantly, and adds a fascinating dynamic unique to practically anything I've ever seen. It's the only time I can say I'm glad two characters I liked don't get along.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.5/10):\\n\r\n\"Fate/Zero\" is incredibly hard-going. The battles are really exciting to watch but, this being an Urobutcher production, there is also a lot of disturbing content, such as one of the Masters being a serial killer who only uses his Servant to kill children and cause as much death as he can. If you have a weak stomach for despair, it's probably best to avoid this series, especially since a lot of the characters are already doomed by canon. The last few episodes in particular are extremely sad and depressing, to the point that I had to watch something more light-hearted immediately afterwards to make myself feel better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n\"Fate/Zero\" is amazing. Despite the lack of progression for about two-thirds of the series and the highly bleak tone, I do not regret watching it at all. The characters, music, voice acting and animation are all fantastic and makes this series highly recommended to any fan of Type-Moon or Gen Urobuchi. Soon enough, I will be watching the \"Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works\" anime and will hopefully have written a review for it by the end of the year.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\n8.5+10+10+9.5+8.5=46.5/50=9.3/10",

            "content": "Story [10/10]: Extremely tight story setting. Perfectly crafted and a perfect blend of action, fantasy, supernatural and historical genres. Set 10 years before the Holy Grail War shown in Fate/Stay Night (the sequel), this is not just any prequel. It is THE prequel that any Fate franchise lover must watch. Newcomers to the franchise will also enjoy the thrill probably to the max since the story in this installment is self-introductory.\r\n***For newbies to this franchise******\r\nThe franchise chronicles a kind of War between 7 magus (Magicians)- the Masters and their Servants, who are Heroic Spirits from different eras. The duels between the participants of the Warare fought to the death and the last standing Master and his/her Servant are entitled the possession of the Holy Grail- a powerful Magical device that can grant any wish, though only one. Fate Zero as well as Fate Stay Night chronicle the events of the Holy Grail Wars taking place in different decades.\\n\r\n*******\\n\r\nOkay since I have watched the sequel, I definitely made some comparisons in the two stories. And the only conclusion I have come up with till now- Fate Zero is extremely focused on the Holy Grail War. Apart from a filler episode all the other episodes focus on the strategies meticulously being executed by each of the Masters along with their Servants. Somehow Fate Stay Night lacked this kind of focus. The strategies of the Masters are complex, the Servants are all very powerful. (Its really not too predictable who the last standing two dueling parties will be). They are honorable knights fighting for the Grail but at the same time also maintaining their pride and dignity. I think it is this fact that has really built up a mood of awesomeness visually in all these episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Art [10/10]: There are a lot of dark scenes in terms of visuals, many shown in the night time or late evenings. Many dark scenes also implied in these settings especially while showing Ryunosuke and his Servant (they are way to grose \u2013so thank heavens they are not explicitly shown in the anime- thank you censorship @_@). The art in terms of the landscapes and city backgrounds is very well made. Characters drawn are fine as well. Animation is top class. All the moves in the fights shown in this season were very clear which added to the thrill of watching them.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]: OP and ED are real groovy and their words fit the theme of the series perfectly. The background score for the series is by Kajiura Yuki, so expect some Piano and Violin as well but in a very un-shoujo genre manner of course. Kajiura Yuki always sets a musical theme song of every character, it is also the case for this series. Iskander and Gilgamesh have been given themes where some middle eastern or eastern instruments have been used. An extremely strong point of this series is the Voice Actors. Each one of them has breath life into each character. The arrogance in Gilgamesh, the pride of Iskander, Saber, all the voice actors have done an excellent job which help in building up the character of each of the Servants as well as the Masters. The dialogues have been meticulously written. Many philosophical, many filled with pride of the knights. They are just perfect- and personally were a treat to read (in the subtitles). They actually made me think about certain things said in the episodes (watch especially ep 11 for a very interesting conversation between Saber and Iskander)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters [10/10]: Okay if you have not got bored and read till this section of my review you might already have gotten a good idea that all the characters are super awesome and cool. I may not be able to put all of my thoughts in good words but to tell the truth I was awestruck seeing all the Servants in Fate Zero. There\u2019s nothing like the abilities of each Servant rises during the course of the show. They are all invincible to begin with. Just the thought of having Heroes from different eras fight on the same battle ground was an awesome and thrilling concept to begin with. The developments in Fate Zero exactly highlight this aspect beautifully (the Servants themselves have dialogues were they acknowledge having been able to fight with a Heroic figure of another era) The Masters are just as manipulative, brutal and come up with complex strategies. The personalities of the cast of Masters and Servants set out for Fate Zero are just perfect and have added hugely for making Fate Zero so good to watch. Personally I was overwhelmed by Iskander\u2019s strength and his thoughts.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall [10/10]: Really no complaints on any aspect of the show. Extremely well planned and executed story. Very interesting plot, perfect for an action thriller. Strong character cast whose actions are enjoyable to watch. Awesome dialogues and strategies shown in the series. Completely recommended.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero - 6/10\r\nFate/Zero 2nd Season - 7/10\r\nOne major let down of Fate/Zero is it's characters. Plain and boring, sometimes they do things for absolutely no reason behind it whatsoever. Only interesting characters are Archer, Kiritsugu Emiya (So Edgy that Matoi Ryuko seems like a fairly balanced person) and Kirei Kotomine (Especially Kirei literally the only reason to watch the show). The rest are just stupid and look like they've been copy-pasted from some saturday morning cartoon. Shitty pacing issues, an actual filler episode (the show is only 13+12 episodes long, get ur shit together). Action scenes look patheticly low-budget and are normally only 20 secslong before some fragment with characters talking for hours and hours (witht he exception of bike chase with Saber and Rider, that was epic). The Story is ok, even though it's presentation is shit. In the Pilot episode we are shown how Mato is the guy, the main char and then he is just erased from existence for next 10 episodes. The show then concentrates on telling us how Saber is the strongest class and shit, and yet for the next 20 episodes it's showing us the exact opposite of that. Music in the episodes is ultra shit, didn't even notice there was a soundtrack. \\n\r\nWhat i liked was the interesting and even somewhat original setting, which was also reduced to nothing in the following episodes. Best moments of this Series is \"Wow did he just kill a character off\" moments, even though they get you sometimes, mostly you will just brush it off because THE CHARACTERS DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE YOU NOT GIVE THE SLIGHTIEST SHIT ABOUT THEM, though sometimes they fail and you may feel feels at tear inducing moments like in episode 20. Although for another positive comment the show somehow does keep you entertained in a way that \"what are these fags gonna do next\" but if you're that easily entertained you may aswell watch cheap american comedy series on budget tv channels. \\n\r\nYou know what? I just really liked the opening cinematics, i think i literally enjoyed LiSA's singing in the opening more than the actual series. Guess what? They got rid of that.\\n\r\nThe characters actions just make you think you're in a trash comedy movie. The Tension only appears in the 2nd half of the series. On the good side there is an original setting and concept aswell as tear-inducing ending which i respect, but the rest is just Naruto-tier, SAO-tier utter trash.",

            "content": "First review,please bare with me.Sorry for the long intro.\r\nThis is a review referring to the series as a whole.That said if i had to score them separately the first season would get 10 and the other 9.I think it deserves more than 9 but if i were to pick between 9 and 10 i would choose 9.I'll,of course,analyze my reasoning somewhere below\r\nTo get this out of the way i'll go ahead and say Fate/Stay Night was one of my first anime to watch.Even though i greatly enjoyed it,i could tell from that early stage of my course as an anime viewer that it was closerto average than good.Later on,the same road inevitably led me to Kara no Kyoukai/Garden of Sinners.For how much hyped the movies were with the anime community i was struck dumbfounded at how average some of them were,however i also recognized the brilliance behind the movies.My relationship with Type-Moon/ufotable was on the slighty bright side but nowhere drooling/biased status when Fate Zero came out.From the first episode i was completely captivated.\\n\\n\r\nWhere to start really...the dialogue was,on the most part,unable to bore you out unveiling this great story about the Grail War,building around the plot while fleshing out as much as possible the numerous major characters of the series and at the same time rarely losing it's true focus.Among other things ditching the whole highschool theme from Fate/Stay night really helped on it's atmosphere and feel of realism.The fighting was one of the best animated i've ever seen in a series which they made fairly clear from the early start of the show.Take that and combine it with it's ridiculously epic soundtrack and you got a recipe for world domination.\\n\\n\r\nYou know what they say though?Nothing is perfect.Some argue that the episodes focusing around Kariya - Toshaka Rin - Sakura were not needed,at least not at the volume it was introduced.I can see why a recently-introduced viewer in the fate series might view them as something close to the so called \"filler\",taking away from the series rather than contributing towards it's success.I firmly disagree on this notion as they set themselves up to provide answers about Rin - Kirei - Sakura relationships in Fate/Stay Night,we get to understand better their standing with each other in the sequel so it was a pretty huge bonus for old fate series fans,for those that have not visited the novels like me at least.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not the type of viewer that gives 10s 9s and 8s very easily,just from the thought i might do a masterpiece wrong by having an indistinguishable score compared to something average.A perfect 10 deserves a perfect anime.However you can go ahead and ask,what exactly is the perfect anime?From what criteria does this come from?Well if its perfect,then i should like it over all else,why am i not?Shouldn't it be my favourite?Or...should it?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer is,of course not.You have preferences that you hold in higher value than all other variables.I can say for a fact that i myself hold another anime as my favourite even though Fate Zero's perfection brings it very close in the contest.However,i can say with little shame that this anime outweights my favourite in almost all fields.You name it [animation,soundtrack,character development,fights,brawls,atmosphere].\\n\\n\r\nYou have to really think though,is this what makes it near-perfect?I have a theory.Fate Zero reaches close to perfection,because it's almost impossible for someone to say they dislike it.A great story that might not be loved by the whole globe but it's pretty difficult to be called average by anyone.Same goes with characters,you might hate Kiritsugu Emiya because you find his goal naive and childish,he hasn't been giving it much thought etc whatever sails your hater boat. but you will still have an ounce of respect for him because of his dedication,strong will,his big sacrifice and whatever else you find great about him,and even if you hate him completely the character development has been deep and efficient enough for you to find another character to call favourite,pick your side on the Grail War.To not drag this any longer this goes for every aspect of the series.\\n\\n\r\nWith the remake of the Fate/Stay Night series this autumn i wonder what TYPE-MOON has in store for us this time around...",

            "content": "With masterful storytelling, captivating character arcs, stellar artwork, and a soundtrack well-suited for a high stakes war, Fate/Zero - I personally feel - is truly anime at its best.\r\nThe very concept upon which the show is based - spirits of heroes from popular legends and myths coming forth to fight in a modern war which makes monsters out of normal people as they kill each other to get their wish granted by the Holy Grail - is fascinating enough in itself to compel one to watch the show. The great thing about Fate/Zero is that it uses all 14 participants (7 magi and their servants)in this battle royale for the grail to their fullest potential, with each character significantly contributing to the plot, as opposed to its sequel, Fate/Stay Night, which focuses primarily on a single character, thus wasting the potential of all other participants.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it is a prequel to Fate/Stay Night, one might as well consider Fate/Zero as a standalone work rather than a prequel, as it doesn't try so hard to play out the stories of Kiritsugu Emiya and company to set things up for Fate/Stay Night or to exactly match how things were in F/SN, but rather develops compelling stories for each of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEach and every character in Fate/Zero is used to their fullest potential in terms of their contribution to the plot, and each character, human, homunculus, or heroic spirit, is explored in depth. And that, I feel, is the show's strongest point. While war makes a monster out of many of the characters (although a few are arguably \"monsters\" to begin with), Fate/Zero dissects every single character, so that audiences are compelled to sympathize with the characters that would normally seem despicable, just because they develop such a deep understanding of them. Moreover, there are no black and white \"good guys\" or \"bad guys.\" Although Kiritsugu Emiya is the main protagonist of the story, he is very morally grey. You will feel compelled to back various characters in the war, not just Kiritsugu.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of the protagonist, it's also important to note that another one of Fate/Zero's wonderful qualities is that the narrative doesn't center around the protagonist. Although Kiritsugu Emiya's back story is given more screen time than those of others, the Holy Grail War itself is the center of the plot, rather than Kiritsugu, and because of this, every participant in the war is [almost] equally represented. Audiences learn enough about the back stories and motives of each character to back anyone, and no character is guaranteed victory in the war either, as anyone can be killed, because there is no clear \"hero\" or \"good guy.\"\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the aesthetics, the character designs, especially for the heroic spirits, are absolutely gorgeous. The use of lighting and colours in various sequences is spectacular. Spectacularly animated, the visuals are backed by a soundtrack orchestrated not only to reflect the grand proportions and godlike beauty and magnificence of the Heroic Spirits, but also to capture the darkness of the war being waged.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap things up...\\n\\n\r\nThe show has wonderful pacing, so that characters' intricacies are explored without bogging down the on-going plot. Nothing is black and white. Your feelings will be muddled and often times you will be confused about who to support in the war or how to feel about a certain character. It is a show that will force you to think about morality, honour, selflessness, and the so-called greater good, and how these values apply in a war that is essentially fueled by greed.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a masterpiece. 10/10. You will not be disappointed!",

            "content": "Tired of \"red-haired walking-cliches-of-a-character\"? Fed up with silly romances? Desperately trying to forget the atrocity that is Fate/Stay Night?        Fear not my friends, your savior has arrived. Welcome to Fate/Zero.\r\n*This review covers both seasons of Fate/Zero(2011) *\r\nStory:\r\nFate Zero acts as the prequel to Fate/Stay Night(2006). Both shows differ immensely with different themes and motifs in each. I suppose you're wondering whether you should watch F/S before F/Z? It's ultimately up to you, but if you ask my opinion F/Z is good enough that stand on its own two feet. If you are looking for a better introduction tothe world and have more free time on your hands, F/S is the better option of the two. However, if you are looking for the  better story, writing, characters, animation etc. then F/Z takes the cake. At the end of the day, it is still YOUR DECISION.   * PS: If you decide to watch both shows, Please ensure that you watch F/S first as by watching F/Z first, you will be incredibly disappointed at how F/Z is better than F/S in every single molecule*\\n\\n\r\nNow that we've finished that, lets talk about the anime itself. The first thing you will notice about F/Z is how mature and dark the show is. It is very much so a nihilistic type of story. This allows the anime to feel fresh and new despite it having the same main plot as F/S, which is a lot more light-hearted. It expects you to pay attention which people may find difficult with it's 40 minute first episode. Despite it's overload of characters in the first episode, as soon as you watch the second episode you will find it moves smoothly along and in a fast paced manner. The fact that the show remains fast paced right through to the end is a very impressive feat with most anime's ending up lost near the end. That's all I'm going to tell you about the story, as it is best to go in blindfolded to get the most enjoyment out of it.  Story: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis show is very much so character orientated which is a good thing as it allows the series to show off its expansive cast. Instead of characters' motivations based purely off emotions, here they are instead based off their own separate morals and ideals. Utilitarianism, Sadism, Honor, Egotism, Hedonism and Fatalism are all shown throughout F/Z and it is always very interesting to see these ideals clash.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all black and white, with characters ranging from a ruthless assassin to an honor bound knight to a serial killer to a tortured unsung hero. This makes it difficult to chose a favorite as practically every character has one fatal flaw. A problem I had with F/S was that it focused entirely on Shirou and Tohsaka for the most part. While here all 14 master and servants are showcased in all their glory and madness.\\n\r\nCharacters:10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nIt is common knowledge as this stage of F/Z's amazing visuals when it comes to animation and it is definitely not an overstatement. However, it is not merely a bunch of eye-soaring visuals. Fight scenes involve well devised strategy and tactics. This makes for my favorite fight scene in all of anime towards the end of F/Z. I won't spoil anything, but I will say it involves no pointless talking or overly long fighting. Just a quick clean fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing that is in play during fights is the internal thoughts of the two opponents. The fight going on between each character's internal beliefs is much more important than the fight going on between their spectacular weaponry. Again, I'm NOT saying the fight scenes are boring, quite the opposite actually with Ufotable's animation being enough to appease anybody. \\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAlthough, it goes without saying that the fight scenes wouldn't pack half as much of a punch without it's exceptional soundtrack. The soundtrack is so good it can turn even the slight few dull scenes into a beautifully bombastic scene of pure and utter glory. The orchestra was a well placed addition especially in fight scenes. I'm not going to use any more words like 'bombastic' and 'exceptional', all you need to know is it's f*cking amazing.\\n\r\nSound:10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you have lost faith in anime recently or need a more mature anime, then fret no longer as Fate/Zero is perfect for you. If you haven't seen the show, then I completely envy you and hope this review has convinced you of it's incredible writing, unique characters, awesome animation and beautiful soundtrack. I'm not saying that F/Z is perfect, as its clunky first episode and confusing ending are setbacks. It is however a fantastic work of art that anyone can enjoy and love.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So fate/zero is definitely an anime worth watching, but one thing to know is that it is a two season anime, and this is the first of those two parts. As such, it does a lot of set up, introductions, and doesn't go into much detail on the story itself. Just bear in mind that even though this (imho) is not the superior of the two seasons, it is still necessary in order to watch the next part. And it isn't unenjoyable at all. \r\nAlso, this is my first interaction with any fate series material. \r\nSTORY:10 \r\nOverall an amazing story setup. It starts of verystrong with a double-length episode, and with it it sets up a lot of the story, but also does not spoil the coming episodes. The main premise of a fight over the holy grail is not in itself original, but the surrounding complications, people, and fights truly take it to a war beyond what was originally thought. Just the summoning of servants for fighting was extremely promising and intriguing, though I won't delve deeper than that to avoid spoilers. As the story progresses, there isn't much of a stale moment, each episode was filled with action. More or less no complaint. A coherent story and a solid setup. An easy 10 in my books. \\n\\n\r\nART:10\\n\r\nThe art is gorgeous. It's drawn well and the quality is sharp. Character designs are also well done, I personally thought they were fitting to the characters and their personalities. Also, I noticed that each frame was done well, there wasn't any sort of cutting corners when it came to artwork and animation. Speaking of animation, its as good as it gets. A lot of fluid scenes and movement is not jerky. Animation is on par with anything you would expect nowadays in 2017. There is use of CGI in it though, just as a heads up, personally did not detract from the experience at all for me. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:9\\n\r\nWell, three parts to sound. (1) Voice Actors/SFX, (2)in-story music, and (3) Opening/ending songs. For Voice actors, they were well chosen, imbued emotion into each character, and were not out of place. Delivery of lines was also good. Sound effects were as realistic as it could get, not bad. All of them made me feel the intended emotion.  In reference to the in-story music, it's also good. it fits the scenes well, and enhances the story without taking too much from it. A lot of epic orchestral music, which is cool in fight scenes and also any other scene. Finally, the Opening and ending songs. Well these are just Okay, none of them really caught my attention right off the bat so I ended up skipping most of them. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:9\\n\r\nThe Characters were all nicely done. Theres good character development, and most of the characters are multi-faceted. None of them are the same, in the sense that they all have different motivations, attributes, and stories. I think that the author's choosing of specific historical warriors also made it much easier to introduce them, since the watcher most likely already has an understanding of who and what some of the characters are. My only complaint would be regarding the few one-dimensional characters, those were easy to spot as potential deaths and thus predictable, but they also did bring a certain gory or self-aware aspect on the destructive force of human nature in contrast to all the good vibes other people were giving off. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:9\\n\r\nHere's where it gets tricky. The story is great, premises are great, and the mechanics of it are awesome. Art is wonderfully done, as good as (or even better than) anime that is done four or five years later. Sound is good. Characters had personality, charisma, and drawing power that comes from deeper characters. So what am i missing in enjoyment? To put it simply, it's the slow pace of the anime as a whole as it is setting up the story, and also the knowledge that this isn't the end, leading to anticipation of the second season. So don't get me wrong i totally did enjoy it, but I feel that in contrast to the second season, I enjoyed that one just a tad more. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:9\\n\r\nIt really is a great anime, and for someone like me who is geared toward ecchi/uncensored/ecchi stuff, this non-ecchi anime had a great story to keep me entertained with the lack of visible cleavage. Great anime, but given that it is more of a set-up anime rather than a conclusion anime holds me back from really giving it a 10/10. Of course if I had reviewed the two together it would have been a 10 as a whole, but split up the first half in my opinion is weaker than the second. So, broken down, it would be a 4 for story + 3 for character + 1 for art + 1 for enjoyment = 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPeace",

            "content": "Story: The Holy Grail war is a battle royale between seven mages each \r\npaired with a Heroic spirit from Alexander the Great, to gilgamesh and King arthur, with the winning duo allowed to have a wish granted by the grail. Fate/zero is the story of the forth grail war, ten years prior to the events of the fifth war in fate/stay night (2006). What is different about this war from that, is the characters. Unlike in fate stay night, with a war focused almost entirely on the protagonist, here it feels much bigger grander and more mature. Alliances and betrayal, well thought out done anddeception, amazing fight sequences incredibly relatable character motivations, a deeply flashed out world, fate zero has it all. The story is original, unpredictable and enthralling. There are long sequences and exposition now and then. And the first episode is one big info-dump. I personally found it highly intriguing, but some of you may not. Overall fate/zero story is one of the more entertaining I've seen. It has everything you could want in an action series, from gripping drama and shocking plot twists to some of the best fights I've seen in an anime, ultimately concluding at a fitting ending that left a major impact at me. At what point do ends not justify the means? Is it right to sacrifice the lives of the few for the lives of the many? What does it mean to be a king? Fate/zero raises these questions and more making for an incredibly thought-provoking series. Sure the first season can be slow and the dialogue can get a bit heavy. Fate/zero picked my interest from the start and never let go, making for one of the most entertaining rides any show has ever taken me on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fate/zero is an extremely mature series largely due to an ensemble cast almost void of any teenagers which is very refreshing. Interestingly, the show doesn't really have a main character, at least not for a while. All of the masters and servants are explored in depth and we get to see the war through each of their perspectives. Fate/zero's war feels like a much grander spectacle. It's not just one guy checking servants office to-do list. But rather a sprawling strategic fight, you know like an actual war. Every combatant in the war has his or her motives for wanting the grail and each of them are relatable for the most part. All in all, you're left with a lot of really intriguing characters. Fate/Zero sets itself up for tragedy even if you have how it ends because each master presents reason to like them or at least feel for them seeing as how the Holy Grail War is a fight to the death. The show doesn't tell you who you are supposed to root for at the beginning. It leaves you to figure it out for yourself. Highlighting how things aren't always as simple as good versus evil. As fantastic as the fights between servants and masters are, fate zero is more than just clash of swords. It's also a clash of ideals. Most of the master-servant pairings mirror each other in some way. Of course the characters weren't all great. Gen Urobochi has a habit of writing ideologies rather than characters. And Fate/Zero is probably the prime example of that. Most of the characters aren't really fleshed out or that well developed they serve more as physical embodiments of their ideals, instead of actual people. The focus is on the character's interactions and not necessarily the characters themselves.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound: From a production's standpoint fate/zero is one the absolute best.The animation is some of the best i've seen for an anime. The action sequences are unbelievably beautiful and the choreography is near perfect. The soundtrack is just epic. Yuki Kajiura utilizes those badass choir vocals endlessly to give nearly every track that grandiose feel. Seriously, this soundtrack has that ability to make anything sound epic. The show has two openings and two endings all of which I like.\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: This review is for both seasons. Season 1 and 2.",

            "content": "This review covers both seasons because they're both parts of the same story and reviewing them individually is stupid.\r\nFate/zero is yet another badly written anime by the shitty writer gen urobuchi and this review explains why.\r\nI'll talk about the good aspects of fate/zero and then the majority of the review will be the bad aspects (because there are too many) the mediocre aspects are anything that i don't end up mentioning\r\nThe Good:-\r\n1- Great Visuals that make the scenes and the backgrounds in the anime look great, but the anime doesn't have alot of animation in it.\r\n2- high quality instruments and sound effects, but the soundtrackitself is not that amazing in fact most of it is forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:-\\n\r\n1- the grail war in this anime never had any clear rules at all.\\n\r\nNo rules were mentioned at the beginning, instead the writer inserted any rules he wanted as the anime went on, even the basis of how magic works were unclear and he wrote them as he went on and made magic adjust to any given situation, which shows how badly written this anime is. An example of this is Kirei blocking Kiritsugu's origin bullets using command spells which doesn't make any sense. \\n\\n\r\n2- Character problems:-\\n\\n\r\nThe masters\\n\r\nKiritsugu Emiya: used to live happily in an island and after like five minutes it turns into hell with zombie infection, so cheesy and unrealistic, then he kills his father who raised him because he was only partly and indirectly responsible for the zombie infection and it was only by accident, it seems like the writer doesn't even know how people normally behave.\\n\\n\r\nKotomine Kirei: starts as a normal guy who works with tokiomi but after archer tells him that he seems intrested in kariya's tragedy he gets rewritten into a one-dimensional villan by instantly betraying tokiomi and seeking the grail that will help him understand himself, which is dumb since an individual normally understands himself more than anyone else, like i said earlier, the writer doesn't even know how people normally behave.\\n\\n\r\nMatou Kariya: who suffers to join the war so he can save sakura, but fails to do so and suffers even more, the only reason he exists is because the writer is obsessed with tragedy, kariya's story has no point, no meaning, it's a complete waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nEl-Melloi Archibald Kayneth: an uninteresting and boring asshole.\\n\\n\r\nThe servants\\n\r\nSaber (king arthur): ripping a character straight from historical books into your anime without bothering to include her background which is necessary to understand her unremarkable struggles in the anime, it seems like the writer has achieved new levels of bad storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nBerserker (Sir Lancelot):same problem as saber.\\n\\n\r\nCaster & his master(Gilles de Rais & Ryuunosuke): both of them don't even care about the grail, they simply spend their time killing kids and talking about how they enjoy killing kids, they're too delusional to even see the possible consequences of their actions like being the first ones killed in the grail war, which actually happens, but why are these characters in the anime anyways? oh yeah because they need SHOCKING scenes in it to attract viewers who only care about SHOCK FACTOR.\\n\\n\r\nArcher (gilgamesh): an egoistical asshole with hax god powers (which he used to kill rider) he doesn't have to worry about anything thanks to his hax powers, which lets him remain as an egoistical asshole with zero character development till the end, he could have also won the war straight from the beginning but he doesn't care about the war, why is he in this anime again? You can remove him from the anime without any changes.\\n\\n\r\n3- Shoehorned philosophy & themes.\\n\r\nThe writer adds unnecessary philosophy & themes to the anime with a very bad handling of them.\\n\\n\r\n- the anime wasted time by having rider and archer talk about how they think saber was not a good king, her life as a king was not shown in the anime and wasn't even part of the anime story in the first place, so why are they discussing it? It makes no sense, even if it made sense it still wouldn't matter because it doesn't affect the anime story, and why are they referring to her as king? she's a woman which makes her a queen.\\n\\n\r\n- after lancer's death saber complains about Kiritsugu's evil actions in the grail war, out of stupidity she forgets that he will use the grail to end war.\\n\r\nthen Kiritsugu claims that honor and valor are the cause of war and bloodshed, yet any one with half a brain can tell how stupid that claim is, the people who got honor from war did it by not commiting war crimes against anyone during war and did what it takes to reduce the losses and hatered of war after it was over, the war itself was not caused or started by them ,The people who cause or start a war usually do it for other reasons without bothering to think of the consequences, they can't do it because of honor since it has no way of starting a war by itself, there is always another reason behind it, if the writer knows of significant bloodshed caused by honor he should mention and explain it, otherwise it comes of as pretentious and stupid, another fact is almost everybody nowadays knows that war itself is bad and nobody think's that war itself is honorable or anything, yet Kiritsugu acts like he figured out something special, it's as if the writer lives in his own small world and keeps including topics in the anime that he himself doesn't even understand.\\n\\n\r\n4- The ending:-\\n\r\nWhich literally ruined the entire story with it's bullshit.\\n\r\nAt the beginning everyone talks about how the grail will grant any wish and nobody doubts it at all and they do all it takes to win the grail but then right at the end it's revealed that the grail won't actually grant any wish, more specificly it won't be able to grant the wish of the winner (Kiritsugu) and then it explodes and kills everything around him, this happened because the grail was cursed before fate/zero and that's only known in other parts of the fate franchise which you have to through to understand this because it wasn't mentioned or probably foreshadowed at any part of the fate/zero anime, if fate/zero doesn't even make sense on it's own and has many writing problems then how can it be any better than the rest of the fate (porn game) franchise? even if the grail got cursed, then why didn't any of the characters know about the curse or doubt the grail? it makes no sense either.\\n\r\nand this ending basically makes the entire anime feel like a pointless waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nKiritsugu, after bad writing destroyed everything he was doing without any explained reason is still happy because he saved and adopted shirou at the end which ties this with fate/stay night, yay i don't care.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero is one of those anime I had to look up after I finished. Fate/Zero is as complex as things like Lain and Haibane Renmei. In this review, I will talk about the execution of Fate/Zero as well as give some thoughts on the characters and story. \r\nFate/Zero is one of the best executed anime I\u2019ve seen. The visuals and sound are phenomenal. The animation quality is massive. The art style is beautiful. The backgrounds are stunning. The characters are well designed. The only thing that stands out is a lack of good directing. The directing is very average and mainstream, but not to thepoint that it hinders Fate/Zero. Fate/Zero also contains the best sound of any anime I\u2019ve seen. The voice acting is superb, some of the best I\u2019ve ever heard. The sound effects are intricately detailed and high quality; they\u2019re on a level I didn\u2019t quite know was possible. The music is beautiful. Fate/Zero is just a breathtakingly well made anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as the execution carries Fate/Zero, what I enjoyed the most about it was its characters. The shounen style characters like Saber, Lancer, Rider, and Waver Velvet are a grounding force to the sociopaths of the series and supply a stark contrast in both character, and writing. What I mean by that is that they showcase how good the writing is given that the writers could write someone as righteous, simple, and honorable as Saber while simultaneously write someone as empty and depraved as Kirei Kotomine. The simple fact that they could put these two characters in the same anime is an accomplishment of storytelling. The highlight of Fate/Zero though, is the sociopaths. Basically everyone else: Emiya Kiritsugu, Gilgamesh, Berserker, Caster, Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald, Zouken Matou, Ryuunosuke Uryuu, etc. Most of the time, in anime like this, the evil characters tend to be over exaggerated. Like in Fate/Stay Night and Re:Zero. Like Zouken Matou. However, Zouten Matou and Caster are the only characters in Fate/Zero that are actually that kind of pure evil. Everyone else is more of a psychopath or sociopath than just pure evil. People like them do exist. I believe that all those anime with overly exaggerated evil psychopath characters strive to make characters like the ones in Fate/Zero but they all fail. Skirting this fine line between realistically evil characters and unrealistically evil characters is what makes Fate/Zero the masterpiece that it is. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters are only given a chance to shine because of the story, however. The plot of Fate/Zero is what allows for these types of characters to exist. I feel like I lack the words to describe how great the story in Fate/Zero is. The best comparison I can make is to imagine Fate/Stay Night if it had been done well. Where Fate/Stay Night failed with cohesiveness and just making sense in general, Fate/Zero excelled. I mean, when you have to pull an Evangelion ending just to explain what is going on, you know the writers are trying. I love that by the way, I haven\u2019t seen it again since Evangelion where we go into the mind of a character and have existential dialogues with omnipotent beings. Not even Lain pulled it off. Lain just had existential dialogues with omnipotent beings in the physical world. I\u2019m rambling. I loved the story. \\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is a masterpiece among masterpieces. I hold it with the highest regard. At the time of this writing, it\u2019s the first anime to break my top ten in years. I didn\u2019t even have a top 10. I had a top 9 because I didn\u2019t feel anything else was worthy of being in that list, until now. \\n\\n\r\nPS: The question comes up (I had this question): Do you need to see Fate/Stay Night before Fate/Zero? The answer is quite regrettably yes. I absolutely hated Fate/Stay Night (read my review for details) and the entire time I was watching Fate/Zero I was looking for reasons to argue that Fate/Stay Night wasn\u2019t worth watching, even for Fate/Zero\u2019s sake. However, as garbage of an anime as Fate/Stay Night is, I do believe the enhancements it provides to Fate/Zero outweigh the suffering required to make it through Fate/Stay Night. \\n",

            "content": "Maturity is something that has become increasingly rare in anime over the years, which is really unfortunate since a fair portion of the best anime ever made either deal with very mature themes or consist of an all adult cast. Take Death Note, Monster, Cowboy Bebop and Steins;Gate as examples of this. I was delighted to see that Fate/Zero both features an all adult cast and is consistently very mature. The show manages to do both of these things spectacularly. \r\nNote: To fully understand this review, please read the synopsis of Fate/Zero. (This will obviously not be necessary if you\u2019ve seen the show already.) Whyyou should do this is to fully understand my arguments and opinions since I won\u2019t bother writing a personal synopsis of the entire show. This review will cover both seasons of Fate/Zero and I will try to keep it as spoiler free as possible. I have watched all 25 episodes twice to ensure that my opinions and thoughts after I watched it the first time weren\u2019t biased. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9 [Fantastic]\\n\\n\r\nIn the world of anime, prequel stories are almost completely unheard of due to the risk they bring with them, as a huge amount of people, myself included, believe that the ending can either make or break a show, depending how the ending itself is handled.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, let\u2019s determine what defines a good ending. Obviously, the answer will vary between individuals, but in my mind a good ending should at least fulfill three out of the four following criteria: It should feel satisfying. It should not be predictable. It should conclude the various character arcs. And last but not least, it should of course wrap up the whole story with a neat little rosette.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem here is that Fate/Zero is the prequel to Fate/Stay Night, and by its nature as a prequel the ending can\u2019t fulfill the vast majority of criteria needed to be a good ending. It can\u2019t be unexpected nor unpredictable since the outcome of the show is already known due to the ladder half of the whole story being released years earlier. Neither can it conclude the story properly since the show must tie into the story of Fate/Stay Night and must thus leave the ending almost completely open. With the ending failing in these two aspects it also automatically fails a third; being satisfying. This is because the ending can\u2019t miss out on two vital aspects and still be considered a satisfying conclusion. The only criteria the show hits is that it does an incredible of job tying up the multiple character arcs, considering how large the cast of Fate/Zero is.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are flaws in the storytelling of Fate/Zero other than the ending. People who don\u2019t know anything about the Fate universe might find the story confusing and the show seems to be aware of this as the first episode of the show is basically a 45 minute bog of pure exposition. This is done to make things less overwhelming and confusing to new viewers of the show, but it instead manages to do the opposite in many cases. It pushes people away from the series rather than properly engaging them and capturing their interest. The first episode dumps so much information on you that you don\u2019t really know what to do with it since you have no points of reference to tie it to if you\u2019re new to the Fate universe. However, the show then promptly awards the viewers who had enough patience to sit through the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might have noticed, I rewarded the story of Fate/Zero a nearly perfect score of 9/10, but up until this point I\u2019ve only been talking about the cons of the show.  So how did Fate/Zero get awarded such a high score in terms of its story? It\u2019s pretty simple, actually. You fill the 25 episodes to the brim with a surprisingly coherent and engaging plot, impeccable character interactions, fantastic world building and enough backstory to make the entire history of Game of Thrones seem easy to memorize in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I didn\u2019t expect the overarching story of Fate/Zero to be as coherent as it turned out to be is due to the plot being told from not one, not two but seven completely different perspectives. These seven are the perspectives of the seven pairs of masters and their servants as they battle it out, Battle Royal style to win the Holy Grail in the \u201cHoly Grail War\u201d. Telling a single story from so many different angles is no easy feat but Fate/Zero pulls this off almost flawlessly.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Fate/Zero manages to be incredibly captivating thanks to its mature nature and clever writing that actually makes the actions and tactics used by the master-servant teams seem well thought out and actually viable in the various situations they\u2019re put in. What\u2019s more the show never assumes that the viewer is too dumb to understand what is going on but still manages to explain everything in a way that felt natural to both the plot and characters. If there was ever a word to describe Fate/Zero, it would be \u201cmature\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nHad Fate/Zero not been connected to Fate/Stay Night both the ending and the show as a whole could\u2019ve benefitted greatly. Unfortunately, it is because of this that the \u201cstory\u201d section of the show only receive a 9/10 from me instead of a perfect score.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 10 [Outstanding]\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s anything that\u2019s rarer than seeing a prequel story in the anime world it\u2019s finding a show with such immaculate detail put into each individual frame of each individual scene that every single one of those frames cloud be printed out and used as posters. Well, that might be a bit of an exaggeration, but it\u2019s still not far from the truth.\\n\\n\r\nI personally don\u2019t like only giving praise, be it to an anime, video game or even a person. This is because I don\u2019t believe that anything or anyone can be completely flawless. With other words, that nothing is perfect. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I had to try my very hardest to find anything, something, some small detail that I could talk about in a negative light in this section, but even after watching the show twice I couldn\u2019t for the life of me find anything that was worth mentioning. Of course, if I really wanted to I could be incredibly picky and talk about how that one character had a kinda wonky facial expression in that one frame in that one scene, but that\u2019s how far I\u2019d have to go to find anything to complain about when it comes to the art/animation of Fate/Zero.\\n\\n\r\nEverything from the incredibly smooth and fluid movements of the characters to the particle effects and lighting looks so good it\u2019s almost unimaginable to think that the show is not a movie, but a 25 part series. The CGI and 3D animation used in Fate/Zero seamlessly blends with the rest and never seems out of place which produces some of the most spectacular action scenes I\u2019ve ever laid my eyes upon.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s actually fairly hard to describe in words how fantastic the show really looks as I do believe that it\u2019s only possible to completely grasp by seeing it for yourself. If I had to use words to describe it I\u2019d simply tell you that it looks absolutely stunning, but since that word has been uncontrollably beaten and kicked by people who\u2019d use it to describe the ham sandwich they ate for breakfast two weeks ago, it doesn\u2019t retain much meaning.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why Fate/Zero manages to look so good is because it was made entirely in-house by studio Ufotable. This means that the different departments had much better communication between each other and a clearer vision of what they wanted the show to be than if they had made use of freelancers, which something that happens way more often than not in the world of anime production. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the kind of show that looks so good you\u2019d be delighted to watch it even if every other aspect of Fate/Zero would\u2019ve been completely appalling.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Fate/Zero is by far the best looking show that I\u2019ve watched with the exception of Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works, which was also made entirely by Ufotable, only it\u2019s 4 years newer.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 [Great]\\n\\n\r\nEvery show has got to have a \u201cweak\u201d point, and for Fate/Zero, that weak point is the sound. When it comes to the soundtrack, there really isn\u2019t much to mention. I\u2019ve always believed that a truly great soundtrack should emphasize the emotions a certain scene is trying to convey. Unfortunately for the soundtrack, Fate/Zero does such a great job with conveying emotions by itself that the music isn\u2019t necessary to help out with that at most times. However this doesn\u2019t mean that the soundtrack of Fate/Zero is neither bland, boring nor bad. The music in the show is actually highly enjoyable and helps the show set up its epic theme. Certain tracks undeniably had a huge presence during some of the show\u2019s most dramatic and emotional scenes and in said scenes the music really did complement the show as a flawless soundtrack should do and it did make those scenes that much more interesting. However, these moments are fairly few and thinly spread out over the 25 episodes of the show. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the soundtrack is by no means bad but there isn\u2019t anything great enough there that it\u2019d be worth listening to outside of the show. This is with the exception of all of the show\u2019s intros and outros, all of which instantly made it to my \u201cFavorite OPs and EDs\u201d playlist.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound design and sound effects, it truly is fantastic. Everything from footsteps to the clashing of swords to massive explosions all sound detailed and clear while also being varied enough to not get annoying, which it can get whenever a show reuses the same sound effect over and over.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Fate/Zero is also top-notch. None of the voices seemed to be out of place or clash with their character and they all sounded very convincing. There definitely is a standout performance in with the rest of the cast. Jouji Nakata, the voice of Kirei Kotomine, truly stole the show whenever he spoke. I don\u2019t want to waste your time simply telling you how good he was, you simply need to experience it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9 [Fantastic]\\n\\n\r\nOh boy\u2026 Where to start with this one. The cast of Fate/Zero is massive for being a 25 part series with a total of 14 \u201cmain\u201d characters and some 10 \u2013 12 minor side characters. The thing that makes this huge cast work so well is that Fate/Zero doesn\u2019t have a single or a small group of main characters, which means that the show can spend an almost equal amount of time with each master-servant pair, thus enforcing the feeling of this being a free for all battle to the death and that anyone can be the last one to stand since no clear victor is given. By its nature as a Battle Royale, the further into the show you go certain characters do get more focus as the cast of characters starts to shrink for obvious reasons.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the seven masters are magic users who have the ability to summon a servant to fight for them, an ability which is granted to them by the Holy Grail. What makes this interesting is that the servants are either great historical figures or ancient legendary heroes. This means that the viewer probably already has a general idea of the backstory of at least some of the characters which can make the reasoning behind the character\u2019s actions easier to understand.\\n\\n\r\nI was amazed by how great Fate/Zero handled its characters, mostly because I didn\u2019t expect the level of character development and careful detail that was put into each and every individual. Almost all the characters have unique and intriguing personalities and they all have their own agendas, morals, ideologies, goals and ways to deal with their current situation. This all makes for some of the most interesting and well written character interactions I\u2019ve seen in a long while. This is especially true when it comes to the master-servant pairs. Most of the pairs presents an interesting dynamic and they are deliberately paired to enforce this dynamic. To improve this further, all pairs feel completely unique and have little to no similarities with each other. I\u2019ll bring up two pairs as examples of this.\\n\\n\r\nThe first pair consists of a master named Ryuunosuke Uryuu and his servant; Gille de Rais, otherwise known only as his servant role, \u201cCaster\u201d. Ryuunosuke is a carefree guy whose only goal in life is to entertain himself. The way he entertains himself is quite *ahem* unorthodox, to say the least. In layman\u2019s terms, he kills people for entertainment and finds joy in the despair of others. We get a fairly clear look at his personality straight away as just moments before we are introduced to him for the first time he murdered a young boy\u2019s parents straight in front of him. We then see him painting the summoning circle for a servant with his toes in the dead parents\u2019 blood, while believing that the circle was to be used to summon some kind of daemon. He then unintentionally summons Gille de Rais, a.k.a Caster. Ryuunosuke agrees to partake in the Holy Grail War, not because he\u2019s particularly interested in the Grail nor the war itself, but because he believes that both that war and Caster will be entertaining to him. These two really go hand in hand since they pay little attention to the Holy Grail War as they only want to entertain themselves. It\u2019s truly in the way that these two differ from all the other pairs that makes them all the more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nPair number two is made up of the master Kiritsugu Emiya and his servant, Saber. As both of them have the same goal, to win the War, they decide that it\u2019d be best to cooperate as much as they can. This turns out to be easier said than done however since neither of them can come to terms with the other persons preferred methods of winning the war. Kiritsugu is the type of man who values the needs of them many above the needs of the few. This means that he would bare handedly kill 100 people to save the lives of 200. This might seem like the \u201cobvious\u201d right choice, but the way he\u2019d go to the edge of the world to see this through, without question, time and time again is what makes him such an interesting morally gray character. Every decision he faces is weighed by his personal moral scale, and he\u2019ll fight with unquestionable determination for the heavier side of that scale every single time. This determination is displayed multiple times throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nSaber, on the other hand, is on the opposite side of the spectrum from Kiritsugu. She, being a medieval knight, values honor above all and would die for her ideals. She considers Kiritsugu\u2019s methods to be disgraceful and dishonorable and refuses to fully cooperate with him due to their clash of ideologies. Saber would never take advantage of an injured or unaware opponent to win a fight while these opportunities are exactly what Kiritsugu searchers for any time he can. This friction between them is ultimately what makes their pairing so intriguing and makes them stand out from the rest of the teams.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might\u2019ve noticed, I never said ALL the pairs or ALL the characters while giving the characters of Fate/Zero praise. This is because the show intentionally ignores one of two of the 14 masters and servants to make further room for the rest of the cast. While I do think that this was the best decision I would\u2019ve wanted the show to truly give all characters the same opportunity to develop. This would\u2019ve been impossible to do without lengthening the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 [Outstanding]\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve been paying attention throughout the review you should already know that there is hardly anything I didn\u2019t enjoy throughout Fate/Zero. I never once felt bored or that what I was watching was unnecessary. I loved close to every second of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 [Fantastic]\\n\\n\r\nWith a fantastic story and even better characters and world class animation to go along with it, there\u2019s not much here to complain about. The music fits perfectly to the story and sets the right tone every single time without fail, but isn\u2019t quite good enough to stand on its own without the rest of the show. The first and last episodes of Fate/Zero are definitely the \u201cworst\u201d in the series, but still manages to be leagues better than the best episodes of most other shows. It should also be important to note that the show is confident enough in its story and characters to carry it that it never tries to gain viewership and attention with unnecessary and disturbing fan service. Yet another sign of maturity.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is as close to a masterpiece as it can be without actually reaching that oh so desirable title of \u201cmasterpiece\u201d.  It has truly become a new staple of maturity in anime and I wish there were more like it.",

            "content": "This review is going to trigger butthurt Type-Moon fanboys, so bear with my opinion if you've got even the tiniest bit of maturity.\r\nFate/Stay Night, a show, more like a visual novel or better eroge, which roughly translated to porn game in English which gets overly hyped recommended.\r\nHowever, this is a prequel to the cringey harem/romantic comedy antics trash that is the main series, thus I thought it'd be something else, having a different director etc.\r\nIn the end I was wrong.\r\nStory : 4\r\nThe plot isn't any different than the sequel: same holy grail war, same classes, same plot devices that ruin the whole show, totally predictableoutcomes, character deaths, and tons, I swear tons of useless dialogues about alternative strategies or edgy bullshit that will make you fall asleep the moment you forget this anime is labeled as \"action\", but I can't expand this part much because I'll end up boring you either way.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\r\nUfotable is my favorite animation studio so far, I can't complain about animations, except for the episodes which lasted longer than usual, I appreciated their efforts in Kara No Kyoukai, and I encourage the studio to pick up better shows.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nWhere's the sound? It was just here because it had to be, besides the openings, there weren't any soundtracks that I could recall from the show apart from edgy music thrown here and there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nI must say the first episode or pilot managed to introduce very well each character, too bad half of them are going to die the next episode for whatever stupid reason they make up to erase a character from the show. However, there's one thing that made me grind my gears, the main character, Emiya Kiritsugu, let me tell you why I hated so much this character: he was firstly introduced as a mature and grown man, then we get to know his past and background, and this is where Fate/Zero jumps the shark. Kiritsugu's logic makes no freaking sense, he kills few people to save many, kill one to save a hundred, but does it apply everywhere? Why did she kill Natalia when she said she was going to retire? Why did he kill HIS FOSTER MOM and why did he kill his father without thinking twice? I don't believe it can be settled with \"you're the only guy who can do this because you can\", it makes no fucking sense whatsoever, he isn't human, the characters aren't human, just a massive cluster of edgy shit with somewhat \"psychology\" when they barely show some human traits like in the case of Kirei. Forget the depth, where's the fucking logic in the first place?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If I could rate it 0 I'd do it, but let's just say 1\\n\r\nThe only enjoyment I ever had from this show was the fact that it was over. I felt like if I had been freed from a cage I was forced to stay in for several days, do you know that feeling? I guess you do.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nI fail to understand why people praise this literal piece of shit, because I can't define it with anything else but shit, when it's but a generic, boring, cringey and nonsenical shows for edgy kids. I'm not watching a Fate/Stay Night anime, play a VN of it, read a manga of it EVER again. If you're a beginner, you'll enjoy this show, if you're someone who's looking for dark and deep anime you're in the wrong place.\\n",

            "content": "** Story ** \r\nSeason 1 is completely unnecessary. There were no real conflicts. Each story arc leads to a hero battle, however, the fights inevitably end with a third party interruption, with absolutely no resolution. This implies the  conflicts weren't necessary at all to the overarching story.\r\nStrong premise, dilly-dallying execution.\r\nStory rating: 3/10\r\n** Art/Aesthetics **\r\nAs a Tsukihime fan, I absolutely love the character aesthetics. \r\nArt: 8/10\r\n** Animation **\r\nAnimation is completely different from aesthetics. The fluidly and detail in each sequence was lacking. The fight scenes had cinematic shots (3 point perspective wide angle launches, landscape shots, extreme close ups, slow motion, etc) which would awean inexperienced viewer. Seeing through all that, all that's left are lazily choreographed fights. \\n\\n\r\nLet's take Saber for instance. Saber is suppose to be the strongest hero, specializing in god tier sword fighting. Yet her swordplay is restricted to 2 moves: swipe and jab. She performs no meaningful parry/counters, feints, etc. Why is her repertoire less interesting than an 8-bit NES sprite? Because it's so much easier to animate, and make up the deficiency with cinematic details (i.e. wind rushing during attacks, ground cracking after taking blows, electrical discharge, etc). Those are all cheap tricks in the literal sense: they're cheap to animate and take little imagination.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n** Sound **\\n\r\nI'm a big fan of Yuki Kajiura. With that said, the soundtrack was bland and unmemorable. Nothing compared to Noir or Madoka Magica. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\\n\r\n** Character **\\n\r\nInitially, characters showed strong potential for realistic development and depth. The first episode did an excellent job of establishing clear and real motivations. However, they all devolve into one-dimensional dark tropes. \\n\\n\r\nLet's take Saber for instance. She's suppose to be a strong female lead, with experience leading an entire nation as a King. As the series progresses, it turns out she's an emotionally distraught insecure 15 yo girl. The authors devolve her into the vulnerable female trope for ecchi reasons (i.e. helpless girl needs a real man for emotional support), and it just blasphemous to her character. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\n** Enjoyment **\\n\r\nDespite all the flaws, I enjoyed the show enough to finish it. I'm fond of strong female characters, and I kept on watching for Saber's shining moment - unfortunately that never comes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n** Overall **\\n\r\nThis is not a series I would recommend to an adult - it's just not worth the time. With that said, I can see why it appeals to teens and newcomers of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10",

            "content": "There are many shows that can captivate based upon the sound design and the artstyle. I must admit that simply that alone was enough to make me start watching Fate/Zero. I was in for a pleasant surprise, and the show surpassed my initial expectations by a huge margin.\r\nI was fairly unaware about anything concerning the Fate universe when I started watching, and anyone that has started to explore this universe must've gone through the same. The story and premise start out utterly confusing; Characters are introduced left and right, rules are set, lines are drawn. At this point, an episode or two into the show,I was unsure if I would ever have the pleasure of understanding what was actually going on.\\n\\n\r\nAs I continued watching, I started to realize that it actually all slowly started to connect. The introductions were simply necessary to establish the founding principles on which this world rests, and I encourage anyone that feels slightly confused to continue watching for at least a few more episodes. The excellent artstyle and satisfying combat alone are already fairly entertaining in and of itself.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story started to intertwine with the wide cast of characters, it really started to pick up in pace, and became a blast to watch. Speaking of the character cast, it's what drives the shows plot, apart from its bizzare but intriguing premise.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have a very distinct set of morals and goals, and they all strive to achieve these goals in one way or another. It's where my founding love for Kiritsugu Emiya came from; The shady guy apparent in my profile picture. The characters are mature and make decisions based upon their own steadfast ideals and necessities, which makes for a very entertaining show. It's almost as if you're watching a giant game of chess, played by multiple teams. They can be unrelenting and unforgiving, making for some very satisfying scenes and pieces of dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle and the combat scenes provided by it, are, up until this day, still one of very best in the anime industry. The fluidity, the edges, the pacing of the frames; It's all marvelous. This is improved by an excellent and intense sound design, that makes you feel the impact of blows and shots in a way not many shows are able to do.\\n\\n\r\nAll backed up by a truly epic soundtrack, that gives a sense of scale when it wants to, and a breeze of emotion when it needs to, provide the show with a strong backbone.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a show that is most definitely worth a watch if you are either a fan of action or someone who enjoys a mature cast of characters, that stay true to their ideals and initial goals. I will continue this review of the entirety of Fate/Zero when I have to time to cover the second season, which maintains the high ground the first season layed out.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for your time, dear valued reader, and hopefully you enjoyed my written experiences concerning \"Fate/Zero\".\\n\\n",

The magic and the dark feel of this show give it a moody aesthetic. The artwork is charmingly illustrated and it's vibrant and crisp looking. The characters are intriguing  without being stereotypical heroes and villains and there is plenty of action to break up thedialogue. This is definitely an anime to invest time into watching.",

            "content": "\"What makes killing justifiable?\"\r\nThe sole answer: NONE.\r\nFate/Zero depicts the 4th Holy Grail War which as the name implies, involves victory with the price of life and the defeat which spells death. Nevertheless, as to why I quote my first line, Fate/Zero is a mature title which embodies gore killings, despicable and ignoble turn of events, deceit, lies, contradiction and many more negative emotions. But as far as my review is concern, I will always try to be prudent with my judgment of this wonderful masterpiece.\r\nLet's start with story. I do remember seeing Fate/Stay Night as a juvenile anime watcher. Don't be confused by the juvenileterm I included, it was just some kind of wording I really like pertaining to greenhorn anime viewer. Back when, like 6-7 years ago, I saw FSN accidentally when browsing on a random anime site. With extra bandwidth on my bargain, I couldn't let one of the most hype shows that year slip away as I started to watch anime in a diligent manner. Okay, time to rebuff this old recollection of mine and start focusing on F/Z.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is nothing short of a masterpiece. If a scale is presented in front of me with the highest points of 10, then I'll exaggeratedly award 11. The story is foul, mature, dangerous and almost illicit. Blasphemous and utterly wicked. Unlike it's predecessor, F/Z dives the path of cruelty explained by clash of point of views, opinions, ideals and dreams. It was something marvelously written and I had no qualms to state that F/Z is definitely one of the masterpieces that will forever be remembered.\\n\\n\r\nFor sure, a lot of people will find my review over-the-limit of what they called praising but mind them, my opinion will stand firm even against a thousand criticizers. First of all, like I mentioned in my last paragraph, F/Z involves a clash of opinions. This is just obvious, but let me phrase that people are beings who thinks of other's opinions as craps and I'm well aware that this involves an awfully large number of persona.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the story, including the pacing, the story's execution is fully oriented as to how it will pierce the very core of a person. Whether we find things in common or not, the story summarizes that most of the character's dreams are too much for them. In the eyes of a watcher, I can't certainly hold the amount of grief I felt while watching. Especially to the best episode I've ever seen in my entire anime-watching career, the Grail Dialogue a.k.a Episode 11. This episode, not only it stroke me an inspiration in life, it also gave me a stiff reality-check that as a person, life is definitely NOT fated, NOT destined and definitely NOT pre-ordained. Within the realm of fate or destiny, life is something a person will struggle to achieve happiness or attain lament. And in F/Z, the makers literally sent a clear relation that LIFE is a continuous DREAM.\\n\\n\r\nDreaming, is a matter of course of living a life. Without it, a person is empty. I highly doubt that the manifestation of the characters are inspired by real personas, but most of the cast wonderfully showed that their dream is worth dying for, worth killing for. I guess, I am that good at avoiding spoilers since I still haven't included one BIG spoiler but well, to a series that aired last 3 years ago, I doubt that my spoiler will affect the majority.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLet's focus now on the art and sound.\\n\\n\r\nOh my! How can this be so much difference to its predecessor? Well, as much as I want to compare the both of them, there's an upcoming 2014 version of the FSN UBW so I guess, I can calm down. I absolutely like the art. The character designs were fitting, the scenery, the sword-clashing effects, the magic elements... they are wonderfully drawn so I had no misgivings to my 10 points for the art department. That much goes without saying with my 10 points for the sound. Like in my 10 points for the previous subject, the sound especially the opening and ending themes are so good. The lyrics were meaningful unlike... oops... I would refrain from mentioning other titles in here, right?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. Spell, 10... ONE-ZERO.ZERO. Why is there another zero? Another cornball jest in my pocket and I know that this is definitely damn, NOT funny at all. But, I would really grade the characters a hundred out of 10. I always include in my other reviews in some sites, that anime can never be a masterpiece only with a good story and art and effects. Without fulfilling characters, it's bound to be just another good title and will never reach the rank of masterpiece and here we are, rewarded with one of the most memorable cast ever.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, all of them, including the minor are given enough depth for me to empathize with them. Why of course, I have favorites... Like for example, Matou Kariya. I would certainly avoid giving spoilers but this character, is the one I can truly understand the most. Whether it he be an utterly huge loser in life, he remains one of my top two favorites, aside from my star, Kotomine Kirei. But that's all for my character review. The protagonist side, of course, is a faction that I like as well but much more, in a good series, one must have a directly proportional villain, in terms of magnitude and intensity.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment... huh? Why do I need to bother explaining myself on this. If someone will read my damn rant, it should be quite obvious already.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, what's my first phrase actually doing up there? I can hardly argue that anime with much killing content is actually the one who will stroke as wonderful title. But in any case, I am not a tad of a diligent believer but as far as my humanity goes, I can still lip an answer from the tip of my tongue that wars are happenings that should never occur or happen in our world. But well, as far as history remarks, the inevitable truth is right in front of us.\\n\\n\r\nConcluding, this first season of Fate/Zero is a bittersweet prologue to the much deserved sequel. But if I were to compare both of the seasons, I will always be a proud fan of the 1st series much more than the sequel.\\n\\n",

So, with loins girded, I will say this. I didn't find this anime compelling in the slightest. To begin with the characters are not good. They are all cliched, and most of their time is spent brooding in one manner or the other. Then the brooding is interrupted by fights between more cliched and uninteresting characters. And why is King Arthur a girl? I know that they wanted at least one girl \"hero\" but wasfinding one so taxing that they just picked one at random? And then they went and made their female character cliched and boring. To compound matters they switched between characters rapidly often giving each of them their own segment in one episode. Which meant that if there is a character that isn't boring, you aren't going to see all that much of them. I admit that the animation is fantastic but other than that I didn't see much worthy of praise.\\n\\n\r\nMy point is that here we have an anime that wanted to be dark and serious. But couldn't pull it off because the characters weren't human. They where ridiculous caricatures. Now I am sorry if you don't agree and you loved this show. You are of course entitled to your opinion but the only thing that could have made this more cliched was if a giant robot decided to show up.",

            "content": "(Note: I'm reviewing both seasons of the show. You have been warned)\r\nAround the time Fate/Hollow Ataraxia was released, a series of Light Novels called Fate/Zero was released, created to explain in greater detail the events of the 4Th Hily Grail War. Which was heavily talked about in Fate/Stay Night, but never actually seen. Eventually, Ufotable (Responsible for the excellent Kara No Kyoukai movie series) decided adapt them. And the rest is history.\r\nStory:\r\nSince we kinda already know how the plot's gonna end, the show instead decides to simply expand on what we already know about the events of the War. In contrast to Stay notht, thetone is positively depressing, yet it works because, again, you already know how it's gonna end (Or at least you should, more on that later).\\n\r\nThe show also mostly focuses on one thing: What does it mean to be a hero? Obviously people like Caster are certainly evil, but what about Kiritsugu? Is he really any better than the people he kills? Or what about Saber? Is her more traditional view on heroism misguided na\u00efvet\u00e9 or does it actually have a point going for it? The show doesn't really give us a clear answer, and I ultimately feel it was for the better, as it leaves the audience to make their own conclusions. I personally moreso agreed with Saber, but mostly because Kiritsugu just went TOO far at times.\\n\r\nMy only problem with the show is that the early episodes are a bit of a slow burn. It's nothing terrible, but it is a bit annoying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is really damn good. Kiritsugu is an interesting protagonist. The guy is positively ruthless, and is also very much stoic. He's a damn good main character to say the least (Though I'll admit that I do find his son to be far better a character) Kirei is basically the Deuteragonist of the show, and a good one at that. His slow decent into darkness as the show goes on is great, and is probably it's highlight.\\n\r\nThe rest of the Masters are kinda hit or miss though. I liked Waver and Kariya, and I'm sorta on the fence about what I think of Toikimi, but I didn't really care for Ryuunosuke or Kayeth that much.\\n\r\nAs for the Servants, Saber and Gilgamesh return because of course they would. Saber is sadly stuck in her Early Stay Night character (As in, so stoic it hurts) but she does get a decent amount of development and you can see how she gained the mindset she had at the start of Stay Night. Gilgamesh is much of the same as before, except only slightly less of a jerk. Emphasis on slightly.\\n\r\nThe rest are also kinda hit or miss though. I really liked both Berserker and Rider (Who would Best Bro if Cu Chuulain didn't exist) but I'm thorn on Lancer. I like how honorable he is, but after a while it seemed as if that was all he had going for him. I also don't care much for either Caster or Assassin (Seriously, why did it take us until Fate/Apocrypha to get a decent Assassin aside from Sakaki Kojiro?).\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: \\n\\n\r\nIt's Ufotable! Even if UBW would end up looking better than this, this show still looks damn good. The fights are all pretty good, with them usually having higher stakes than their Stay Noght counterparts, and it certainly works.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack is amazing. Aside from the expected remixes of songs like \"EMIYA\" and \"Yakusoku Soreta Shouri No Tsurugi\" we also have a large amount of excellent new sounds added for good measure. As for the Openings, I didn't care much for \"Oath Sign\" but I did love the second opening \"To The Beginning\". Probably my favorite Fate opening alongside \"Disillusion\" and \"Brave Shine\". Both of the endings are great too.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is great. We obviously have some returning faces like Ayako Kawasumi, Joji Nakata, Kana Ueda and Tomokazu Seki, and they do a great job as always. However it's the rest that stands out. Rikiya Koyama (Who's technically not a newcomer but he had a really minor role in Stay night so I'll count him as one anyways) was excellent as Kiritsugu, completely selling the character's cynicism and bitterness. The rest is great too. From Sayaka Ohara, Ryotaro Okiayu, Akira Ishida, Takumi Yamazaki, Akio Otsuka and Daisuke Namikawa. Zero's cast is the definition of greatness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I really liked Fate/Zero. That said, would I recommend it as anyone's introduction to Fate? No! Read the Visual Novel first, as Zero spoils a good bunch of its events like if it was something you should already know. It's best enjoyed as a tragedy. One that you know won't end well, but the characters will still try. This is not an epic, this is The tragedy that begins an Epic, and it's Best enjoyed that way.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "As a prequel Zero does alot to revitalize the Fate franchise and improves on many aspects of it's predecessor Fate/Stay Night.\r\nUnfortunately while the improvements are many I personally felt some aspects were still overlooked and ultimately held the series back. Primarily the story, which while talked about between the characters in an epic fashion is rather plain and without much structure. The Holy Grail war sounds about as epic as you can imagine and as I say the characters do a good job through dialogue making the whole thing very grandiose sounding but ultimately in this first season it amounts to nothing more than randomencounters seemingly without much purpose or buildup.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the War is a 24/7 affair you would think there would be some real tension in this series but often times the Hero's and their Masters are all too happy to converse with each other and forget about the War between them for now. Across the first season only two real fights of any substance occur and little comes of either in the end. Both also involve the spontaneous arrival of another Hero with again no buildup as to why they have decided to attack now shown to the viewer. I guess what I'm trying to say is where is the plan? The path to victory is seldom discussed between Hero and Master save for a few lofty goals they may hope to achieve upon victory. The Holy Grail War is ultimately a game of Survival, Life for the victor and death upon all other participants. Yet the show doesn't build that aspect up like I hoped. \\n\\n\r\nFortunately the characters are great which while not enough to excuse the somewhat directionless, tension free story does at least mean the show is entertaining. Rider,Gilgamesh, Lancer and Saber are all enjoyable as the mystic Heroes. Kiritsugu and Waver are both great too albeit in vastly differing ways. \\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is still a missed opportunity that fails to really deliver on it's grand promise. First half builds up to nothing and is only a separate season by necessity rather than by design.",

I didn't know which series to start with, I chose Fate/Stay Night and to this day i don't regret that choice, I think that way everything became clearer in my head.\r\nFate/Stay Night didn't become my favourite anime, but I consider it something worth watching.\r\n95% of people I spoke with about the anime said Fate/Zero was a lot better than the previous.\r\nHigh expectations usually generate bad results, isn't that right?\r\nWithout wanting to spoil anything, iI will try to explain the reason I disliked Fate/Zero:\r\n\u2726The characters even though diverse, don't outshine those of Fate/stay Night. Non ofthem was truly captivating to me. Saber, who is one of the strong points of Fate, doesn't become any more interesting or less prestiged in this anime, and since I already knew her, this became less irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726The action was lacking, and when there was any, it had no purpose in a story development stand point, \"LETS FIGHT, LETS KILL EACH OTHER\", and then, 5 minutes later they would simply go home and we would go back to zero.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726There were a bunch of episodes with pointless dialogue that added nothing to the story. It was simply tedious.\\n\\n\r\nI don't consider it a bad anime in the literal sense of the word, I just don't think it was as good or even superior to Fate/Stay Night and/or it surprised me in any way. The fault was mine for placing the anime on a pedestal, and the fall ended up beeing greater.\\n\\n\r\nObviously that watching Fate/stay Night and ignoring Fate/Zero is unthinkable if you really want to understand the story completely..\\n\\n\r\nI still have hope that the second season is better.",

Complimented by many twists and character development done correctly. This story starts off at a slow start and than spontaneously explodes into a cascade of brilliance. The work's portrayal of character relationships with the story's darkatmosphere helps to emphasis the seriousness of the story and how fleeting and cruel life can be.\\n\\n\r\n If what you, the viewer are looking for is an anime with an amazing story, characters you can grow attached to, beautiful visuals, and unbelievable audio than Fate/Zero fits the bill.\\n\\n\r\nThank you",

            "content": "One thing that is likely to surprise a lot of people who are newly introduced to anime is just how powerful the tales that are told have the potential to be. Just simply being animated doesn\u2019t take anything away from the narrative, and once in a while, the quality of these stories butt heads with actual literature. That\u2019s because once in a blue moon, anime is adapted from just that\u2026 actual literature.\r\nCue Fate/Zero, Ufotable\u2019s treasured serial anime, and prequel to the revolutionary Visual Novel adaption, Fate/Stay Night. Praised by many as a jewel that could stand against the likes of epics such as The Odysseyand The Inferno, Fate/Zero is an exceptional example of just how close to written compositions anime can really be.\\n\\n\r\n---This review has been rewritten and rescored to better suit my personal opinion and the best interest of the readers, to be both informative and entertaining. Also note that this a review of both seasons as a whole, because cutting it has proved more than once to be near impossible---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---PLOT---\\n\r\nSomething that many Battle Royale tales lack is actual depth; as they seem to be fighting for absolutely no purpose in a number of cases, and when they are, the meaning behind it is lost in a sea of inconsistencies, overwhelming usage of plot armor, and a staggering number of plot holes. (Thumbs up to whoever can guess which one I\u2019m talking about) This leaves a lot to be desired for those of us who crave intellectual storytelling as well as over the top action.\\n\\n\r\nWith this in mind, Fate/Zero may appear to be something that would prove this statement even further. But with this argument, a reference to literature comes to mind once again. Have you ever heard of the term, \u201cDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover?\u201d Of course you have, who hasn\u2019t? Imagine Fate/Zero being the book. It may not look like it stands out, but you have to open it and read to find out if it holds its own. Within the pages of Fate/Zero, one will see the proper way to execute the premise of a fight to the death. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting is a mixture between modern day and fantasy where seven heroes summoned from history and seven masters guiding them battle over the Holy Grail in an event called the \u201cHoly Grail War.\u201d (In this case, it\u2019s the fourth) It allows for many supernatural oddities such as magic, and its presentation is undoubtedly professional. It\u2019s the kind of magic that has a lot of technical aspects to it, and its not omnipotent like most forms of sorcery found in fiction nowadays. \\n\\n\r\nThe capabilities of the seven Servant classes (Saber, Rider, Caster, Lancer, Archer, Assassin, and Berserker) that the heroes materialize into basically speak for themselves, and all the techniques the Servants use (called Noble Phantasms) draw back to their legacies. (For example, King Arthur\u2019s Noble Phantasm is Excalibur, Alexander the Great\u2019s is his entire army, and so on.)\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero also focuses a great deal on actual strategy and cooperation, so the story is entirely character driven. Entirely. This is its highest strength, because it keeps the anime from ever becoming formulaic, so it retains its unpredictable nature throughout, and it additionally creates an intellectually stimulating atmosphere. You never know if \u201cthis\u201d character is going to win, or if \u201cthat\u201d character is still alive or not. It is within these bounds that the story is able to completely relay its purpose to the audience. There are many powerful messages about worldly occurrences in Fate/Zero that are present at any given time in the story. It touches on things like corruption and greed, loyalty, courage, betrayal, and above all, how there truly is nowhere on earth that one can go, and not find suffering or pain, and the idealism of abolishing that entirely.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has nearly everything. So maybe you\u2019re wondering about the ending?\\n\\n\r\nRemember that Fate/Zero is a prequel, and prequels are not meant to be conclusive on their own. I hesitate to a large degree in bringing up Star Wars but it\u2019s the only thing I can use. Imagine watching the Star Wars prequels. (Oh god) You don\u2019t go, \u201cWhat? Anakin turns to the dark side? That\u2019s it?\u201d No! You go watch the original trilogy! By god, why haven\u2019t you seen it first anyway? \\n\\n\r\nTo anyone who finished Fate/Zero? Go watch Fate/Stay Night! (Preferably the 2014-15 adaption.) To anyone who already has seen Fate/Stay Night, the ending to Fate/Zero is something that should be predictable right off the bat; Fate/Zero\u2019s initial purpose is explaining the events prior to Fate/Stay Night, after all. \\n\\n\r\nBut basically, the plot is downright amazing. Albeit there\u2019s a lot of exposition, it\u2019s hands down a perpetual rope of fantastic. \\n\r\n---Plot Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---CHARACTERS---\\n\r\nSimply being diverse in nature doesn\u2019t ensure that, as characters, they will offer anything to the story. More often than not, authors create a cast of snowflakes and leave them as is. \\n\\n\r\nBut there isn\u2019t such a thing as a participant in the Grail War that lacks at least some form of depth or direction. They all have difficult and complicated pasts, skeletons in their closets, and a complex set of morals (or a complete lack of morals altogether) that define them as individuals. Every single one of them has drastically different reasons for participating, and the relationships between each team have large sets of contrasts and differences that range from absolutely hating each other, to being the best of friends. In some cases, they even straight up don\u2019t interact much at all. The Masters themselves are reflected in their Servants in some way, be it what they want to be, what they are, what they despise, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the course of the story, every character alters and develops, and whether the direction they change at is forward or backward depends on the events that unfold and how it affects them. Sometimes it\u2019s subtle, like an opinion change. Sometimes its drastic, like a swaying of their personality altogether. The variance on this adds even more depth to their differences.\\n\\n\r\nIn a sense, the characters are comparable to a game of chess. (The anime certainly does express this through its first ending) Every piece serves a different purpose, and a movement made by a piece you forgot was even on the board could mean a different outcome of the whole game entirely. But unlike chess, Fate/Zero is a privilege to watch, and not a chore. \\n\\n\r\nBut with the good\u2026 comes the\u2026 slightly irritating?\\n\r\nOn occasion, character conversations will carry on for almost ten minutes; and while the dialogue is an essential part of how the anime progresses, I can\u2019t help but feel sometimes it\u2019s too much. They\u2019ll even stop in the middle of a battle and start talking! All for the sake of dumping elucidation. Albeit that is annoying, it\u2019s hilarious when the anime acknowledges it, as some of the other characters will basically tell the ones talking to shut up. \\n\\n\r\nAnd there\u2019s also that Fate/Zero borrows heavily from factual past, as it has about as much lore as the entirety of Lord of the Rings. In itself this isn\u2019t much of a problem at all, because to someone who knows their history the show is heavily rewarding. But the thing is, it doesn\u2019t go to lengths to give specifics about or elaborate on the motivations of certain characters, plot twists, and so on. This leaves a lot of historically uninformed watchers in the dark as to why \u201c___ hates ___,\u201d or how \u201c___ can do ___.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nBut regardless of these problems, the characters of Fate/Zero are genius. They\u2019re complex and unique, and completely devour the plot with their importance.\\n\r\n---Plot Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---ANIMATION---\\n\r\nIn an animated series, this is arguably the best animation I have ever seen. It rivals many movies produced by the studios over here in the US. There is literally no problem with it, even the %$#@ing CGI looks amazing! Any regular reader of mine will know I HATE 3D in anime with a burning passion, but somehow everything visually rendered is captured so flawlessly, I literally cannot find any semblance of a problem with it. \\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero\u2019s art is simply beautiful, and each character is immediately distinguishable from the others because of their unique designs. The fluidity is downright breathtaking, the attention to detail is unreal, (there\u2019s goddamn dust particles! Did you hear me? Dust! They shimmer in light, appear during fights when dirt is kicked up, it\u2019s just a feast for the eyes, man!) and the action just makes my hair stand on end. \\n\r\n---Animation Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\\n\r\n---SOUNDTRACK---\\n\r\nWith the animation this anime has, its no surprise that the music is on the same tier of quality. \\n\r\nYuki Kajiura has this amazing ability to make anything she puts her work in sound amazing, even if the show itself is shoddy at best. (Another thumbs up to who can guess the anime this time) With everything that I\u2019ve heard of her, she\u2019s never disappointed me once with her soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the characters come from different places, so some of the pieces sound Greek, some of them sound British, and some of them even sound Persian. This makes the feel of diversity much more genuine, as the soundtrack really does pull from these different culture\u2019s music. From everything to the harmony of the orchestras to the openings and endings, another spectacular feat.\\n\r\n---Soundtrack Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\r\nAFTER REPORT:\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n- Amazing characters and smart diologue\\n\r\n- Amazing plot, analytical and strategic\\n\r\n- Really great music\\n\r\n- That animation is godly\\n\r\n- Fight scenes are masterful; the magic in this universe is stunningly professional\\n\r\n- Fresh overall show that doesn\u2019t pander, filled with horrifyingly realistic representations of reality and history\\n\r\nMIXED:\\n\r\n- Character conversations carry on, lots of exposition\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n- Predictable ending if you\u2019ve seen Fate/Stay Night\\n\r\n- Doesn\u2019t go to enough lengths to elaborate on the history it borrows from\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: -Brilliant-\\n\r\nIt is my ultimate conclusion that even a \u201c10\u201d can have flaws. While Fate/Zero has a few tiny little problems, that number is miniscule. I\u2019ve actually seen this anime twice, and I can say that both times I was taken aback by it in nearly every way. \\n\\n\r\nGen Urobuchi\u2019s Fate/Zero is wonderfully detailed and deep. Please, if you enjoy mature stories with bucketloads of depth and creativity, do yourself a favor and at least consider.\\n\\n\r\nThe Holiest of wars decided this anime deserves a 10/10\\n",

I watched this series after Fate/stay night:UBW so it was reverse from the point of Fate's story.\r\n*Maybe contains some spoiler*\r\nCharacter & plot: I found Kiritsugu is the not typical protagonist. His ideal and how he cooperates with Saber-his servant-is unique. Though, the series itself is about dark fantasy with some magical-thing, but the main hero is against the magic user because of his past. The story is amazing, better than Fate/stay night UBW. Character development is good enough for the side character,I mean usually the portion of side chara's development is lack.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & sound: As expected from ufotable and type moon, the animation is stunning. The soudtrack fits the scene. The color is amazed me when it comes to fighting scene. I like both OP and ED. Thumbs Up!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A must watch series for who likes fantasy with a deep plot. Not your typical magic-series, because it has mature logic, idealism, and story. High quality animation with great sound.",

            "content": "So Fate/Zero the prequel to Fate/Stay Night is utterly fantastic. It is more mature than it predecessor, great animation, fantastic fights and it has the distinction of being a story with no heroes in it. Because of this fact that there are no heroes everyone is ruthless and brutal in all out contest for ultimate power. Though like its predecessor the main theme deals with the nature of ideals. More importantly how far are you willing to go for your ideal and how much are you willing to sacrifice. However, if you sacrifice everything for an ideal, does it remain an ideal? Regardless i enjoyedthe raving psychopaths and the egomaniacs conduct their evil schemes to sacrifice mankind on a high altar for the own power but i enjoyed the grey characters all the more. All with their own ideals and wishes for a better world which makes it hilarious that they have to bathe their hands in increasing amounts of blood just so they can lie to themselves that they are working towards a better world. On its own Fate/Zero stands out but as a whole for the Fate Series it compliments the whole and corrects nearly all the problems of its predecessor. Even adding nuances which makes a second watch of the original series all the more worthwhile as histories and relationships which are never addressed are brought to the fore adding a new layer of complexity. This is one i will watch again and using this this as a springboard for the remake of Fate/Stat Night has made it all the better. 9/10",

            "content": "(COMPLETELY SPOILER-FREE)\r\nI recommend playing Fate/stay night, the game from 2004, entirely (all three routes) before watching Fate/zero. You won't lose anything in terms of watching F/Z  -in fact you'll appreciate many parts of the story more this way-  but most importantly you'll be able to avoid spoilers by starting with the VN. Not that you couldn't enjoy the VN after watching Zero; it's just that you'd probably find it great, but relatively far from a masterpiece, and I feel this would be extremely regrettable.\r\nMy first impression of the anime was excellent. The pace is good, the music fits well to the plot andthe visuals are stunning. As this is the prequel for one of my favorite stories of all time (FSN), my expectations were as high as they could be and on the surface, the anime doesn't disappoint. However, after spending considerable time reflecting on how well F/Z fares in terms of what I consider some of the most important aspects of a great story - the overall structure (consistency and arrangement), characters (and their development) and 'intelligence' (including depth) - it appears to leave much to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nAs an adaptation, Fate/zero is quite high-quality. The pace isn't too fast - unlike the adaptation for Fate (or the UBW-movie, Umineko etc), it wasn't created as a 'bare minimum' that rushes through the main points of the story, leaving out any finer detail. Thanks to the nearly optimal pacing, the atmosphere has been kept largely intact.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the plot was born as a background story in the visual novel, and although Urobuchi did a fairly good job bringing to life the framework for the events that is set up in the game, the big picture ends up feeling shallow, even to the point of resembling that of a generic fanfic. All new characters lack depth, and with some important exceptions, many are stereotypical or otherwise uninteresting. In terms of development, only the protagonist receives satisfactory treatment. For some reason, Urobuchi even wastes some quite obvious opportunities for potentially interesting interactions. He might've found them difficult to integrate to the main plotline or perhaps distracting. However, I feel the story isn't complex enough to afford such simplification.\\n\\n\r\nEven worse, the plot in F/Z tends to develop in such ways that are ultimately incompatible with constraints set by the portrayal of the events in the original. This leads to problems that are often handled gracefully, but sometimes they're solved forcibly enough to leave a mildly unpleasant aftertaste. I imagine that with some effort and creativity, perhaps involving plot additions, all of this could easily have been avoided.\\n\\n\r\nI'm also unsatisfied by how important events are handled. There's often little to no build-up, and most of the more anticipated scenes end up anticlimactically. This necessarily makes for a more bland viewing experience, and probably could've been dealt with with relatively little work on the author's part. This may just be Urobuchi's 'style', but I personally don't appreciate it.\\n\\n\r\nSome feel /zero features themes that are more mature than those of FSN, and while I understand the reasoning behind this, I see things the other way around. The newly added drama and conflicts (that aren't present in the original) are largely shallow and stereotypical. The deepest philosophical elements in the anime are the same as those introduced in the visual novel, but F/Z inspects them from a narrower perspective -- since the game consists of three noticeably separate stories, this is to be expected, but it is worth taking into account.\\n\\n\r\nA less significant point I find disappointing is the relative lack of effort spent in making the battles entertaining. With one or two exceptions, not much thought seems to have been put into adding strategical flavor or deeper plot involvement.\\n\\n\r\nAs an overall rating, in an intuition-based analysis I ended up with the following:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 74/100\\n\r\nMusic: 70/100\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 90/100\\n\r\nGraphics: 85/100\\n\r\nOverall: 74/100\\n\\n\r\n(I personally base the overall enjoyment mostly on the plot)",

            "content": "Let me say it straight: I'm reviewing only the first part of the show, since it is a split cour. Everything written here applies only to S1. Also, I'm a huge fan of the original VN and Nasuverse as a whole. I guess, the review definitely has some bias.\r\nSometimes, a show needs exposition, because otherwise it is impossible to tell a complete and logical story. The exposition is needed to set up the characters, the stage and the events leading to the main part of the series. The first cour of Fate/Zero is such a case: it is just an infodump containing everything necessary tounderstand the plot of the second half. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with such shows is that you need to make them interesting to watch. And Fate/Zero spectacularly fails in this regard, offering pointless, long and dragged dialogues (for people who have read the visual novel Fate/stay night, like me), atrocious pacing, fillers in a 1-cour series and somewhat unique, but shallow and one-dimensional characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe main premise of the story is simple: 7 mages and their 7 servants are battling for an ephemeral prize: The Holy Grail, an omnipotent device which can grant a wish for the winner. The premise itself is definitely interesting; the main problem is its execution. Let me say it straight: it's awful. There is very and very little plot progression over the course of the series. It tries to intrigue the viewer in the first couple of episodes (if you manage to bear that 40-minutes infodump in the first episode), but after that we are left with 11 episodes of pure, unspoiled, forgive me, Lord, Glasslip. I'm exaggerating a bit, but that's what it is: NOTHING happens-. Occasional dialogues about the eternal don't count. \\n\\n\r\nI have a small chart, which can show you the structure of the show:\\n\\n\r\nEpisode - what happens\\n\r\n1 - infodump\\n\r\n2-9 - talking and a couple of fights\\n\r\n10 - A GODDAMN FILLER\\n\r\n11-12 - talking.\\n\\n\r\nThis pretty much summarizes everything what happened in the first cour in terms of story. Don't get me wrong: I adore dialogue driven shows like Monogatari and Tatami Galaxy. Hell, I even enjoyed Heaven's Feel route of novel af. Fate/Zero tries to pull the same trick with its pacing and dialogue-driveness, but it falls short. The dialogues are plain and generic. Not to mention that sometimes they suffer from bad writing and induce cringe.\\n\\n\r\nHowever we are starting to forget what was the purpose of the first cour. Introducing the characters. I must say that Fate/Zero doesn't perform well in this regard, too. The characters, while having their unique traits, are simply shallow and not interesting. New characters lack in depth, old characters became worse. Saber is a highlight of the show, however her character is more of a whiny 14-year-old. Yes, she is stoic, but her ideals are completely idiotic. She is much more well-written in FSN, but here she, again, lacks in depth. Gilgamesh is an arrogant prick, as always, but he is even more unlikable in Zero than in FSN. Kiritsugu is your average edgy protagonist, no more, no less. Other masters and servants are either generic and plain (Kayneth, Tokiomi), or are severely underdeveloped (Kirei, Kariya, Waver). Looking forward to the S2. \\n\\n\r\nBut I must say that the production level of the show is simply amazing. The graphics are stunning, and the art is faithful to original Takeuchi designs. Music by Kajiura is amazing, too. No complaints on this part, however it is not enough to cover the faults of other aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Fate/Zero S1 wasted its potential to become a great exposition for truly glorious events and actually is a series of pointless and boring dialogues with some occasional fights. The heaviest disappointment I've had yet.\\n\\n\r\n+Production quality\\n\r\n+Sound and music\\n\r\n+Nasuverse is always welcome\\n\r\n-Atrocious pacing\\n\r\n-Shallow characters\\n\r\n-Dragged dialogues\\n\r\n-Fillers, goddammit \\n\\n\r\n3.5/10",

            "content": "Fair warning: This review contains minor spoilers.\r\nOver the last decade or so, Type-Moon has rapidly grown in popularity and number of anime adaptations. This growth is spearheaded by Type Moon's flagship, the Fate franchise. Fate/Zero is a prequel to the Fate/stay night VN written by Urobochi Gen and not Type-Moon themselves.\r\nThis series is the first encounter I've had with Type-Moon in general and honestly, I think starting off with this series was a good decision.\r\nThe Fate franchise itself focuses on the Holy Grail War, a Battle Royale between seven masters and their respective servants, heroic spirits divided into seven classes, with the end goal ofacquiring the Holy Grail, a omnipotent wish-granting device to be used at the victor's disposal.\\n\r\nThere have been many Battle Royale series, both in- and outside of the anime medium, in recent years. To be blunt, most of them aren't good. Battle Royales are hard to pull off, mainly because of what a Battle Royale entails: Many characters, most of which will die eventually.\\n\r\nMost writers already fail at properly developing their often gigantic cast of characters, which results in most of the characters being dull and boring. Add to that the multitude of character deaths a Battle Royale entails and you have yourself a recipe for disaster.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero isn't one of these many failures however, which can be attributed to the brilliant work of Urobochi Gen. This series is a perfect showcase of Urobochi's skill and proficiency at creating entertaining fights, multi-dimensional characters and several intriguing dualites in philosophies and idealisms.\\n\\n\r\nMy high praises may seem out of place considering my rating, but there is one very important thing to keep in mind when talking about the anime of Fate/Zero: it has two seasons.\\n\r\nHaving two seasons isn't a negative most of the time, but it really hurts this series from a standalone perspective. As explained earlier, a Battle Royale entails a multitude of things, most of which is developing and setting up. This basically sums up this first season. It establishes several dualities and plot threads. The participants first are mostly acting defensively in order to gain the first bits of information about their opponents, to gain a strategic advantage. This sounds great on paper, at least in my opinion because it is the most rational thing to do and speaks volumes for the high-level writing present in this work, but actually watching the whole thing isn't really all that exciting. The first season is dialogue-heavy, to say the least. Most fights only amount to small skirmishes and are mainly used to introduce certain plot points and character relations. Early fights in a Battle Royale have little to no meaning, as one couldn't possibly be invested in any of the characters, so this being the case is actually a positive overall, but nothing really exciting happens. After 12 episodes, all participants still remain. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to build a house, you need a solid foundation. This only gets truer the higher you build. Fate/Zero is a story striving to be a skyscraper, to reach greatness, and as such needs a solid foundation. This first season is just that \u2013 a solid foundation.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've paid any attention whatsoever to anime discussion, or rather anime animation discussion, you should have heard of the studio ufotable and their brilliant work animating the Fate franchise, several times at least. And it is true, especially their digital art is breathtaking. The usage of said digital art also allows the key animators to not have to spend all their time and these extra VFX and makes animating the fight scenes easier, and it really shows. The fight sequences, although few and far between, look gorgeous. The same can be said for the backgrounds, they are very rich in detail and a sight to behold. Definitely not something you'd expect from a TV anime unless you already know about this visual greatness before watching the show (which is close to impossible, but that's beside the point). Sadly there isn't much to work with in this first season. There is only so much you can do when characters talk for close to ten minutes straight, resulting in at times questionable cinematography. A fairly famous example would be in episode 1: Because the room the people are in is fairly empty, some visual stimulation is needed. This is achieved through two of the three characters walking in circles around the third character with the camera following them for what feels like one and a half eternities. This also happens in fights sometimes and it feels awkward and uncomfortable at best.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that may or may not make a viewer feel uncomfortable are the at times gruesome images in this show. Especially a infamous scene, again in episode 1, seems to catch many viewers off-guard. Oftentimes, these scenes are poorly handled. They lack sufficient build-up that'd be necessary to create a solid impact. The only instance of these gruesome scenes pulled off well in the first few episodes would be Caster killing his first victim. The scene uses fairly basic symbolism in the half-open door with light shining through being a symbol for both hope and escape from the dark room of indiscriminate killing, and the shoes in the light-flooded floor remind the boy of his family that just was brutally murdered. He then ends up getting literally ripped apart from Caster's magic. \\n\r\nWhile this scene is one of the few unsettling scenes pulled off well, it is just one of the many times that very simple symbolism, easy enough for everyone to grasp, is used to enhance a scene. \\n\\n\r\nKeeping in mind that this series is figuratively 12 episodes of build-up, Fate/Zero really is a great experience. The build-up is great and, trust me, the second season is masterfully executed. I recommend everyone to give this one a shot, especially those who like their fights to be well-choreographed, their characters to come with depth, and their anime to be filled with despair.",

            "content": "Fate Zero genre is Action, Fantasy, and Thriller. Let's start on the animation, because in this show their was never a dull or bad moment. lt was just spot on and the action scenes were even better than l could even imagine. This show doesn't really have a main character, but some say this is. Just about everyone gets screen time for at least 1 episode or more. Let start on the human side Kiritsugu Emiya, lrisviel van Einzbern, Kirei Kotomine, Tokiomi Tosaka, Waver Velvet, Kayriya Mato, Ryunosuke Uryu, and Kayneth El Melloi Archibald. Most of these people besides lriseviel has a \"servants\", but shehas her own importance. Now to servants and each of them are someone from history either famous or not. Archer is Gilgamesh, Lancer is First of the Knights of Fianna, Rider as Alexander the Great, Caster as Bluebear or another name is Gilles de Rais, Berserker is the Black Knight, Assassin is reincarnation of the head of the assassin order, and finally Saber known to be King of the Knights. With such a huge list many may say character development must've suck. Surprising no and the reason why is because of the story/plot. The story is 7 people are chosen to participate in the 4th Holy Grail in Fuyuki City. Each of these 7 people gets a servant that has powers to win the war. So with that said only one can win thus within a 24 episode limit they did very well. Having character development deepens on who survives. The director is Ei Aoki and he has done or be apart in Angel Beats, Baka to Test, Blood +, and Sword Art Online. He has done many storyboards and even taken a few episodes to direct in. The studio is ufotable who does more of movies or OVA's rather than its own series. The only other series i've seen by them is Gundam Seed. The music was probably what gave it its own feel to it. l haven't seen too many shows that has a good soundtrack that gives this feeling of epicness. The person who did it was Yuki Kajura and she has done Sword Art Online, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Tsubasa Chronicle, and a few others. Their is only a subbed version and it would be very interesting to see a dub coming in the future. ALSO quick note this is a prequel to Fate stay/night which was made before this show. Which to me the animation is completely different and even the feel of the show is just worse overall. So, with all being said i'll give this anime 10 out of 10",

            "content": "This review will be on both Fate/Zero and Fate/Zero Season 2, which I am counting as a single entity. My apologies for any confusion.\r\nThe main problem most people seem to have with this anime is the historical \"inaccuracies\". I put that in quotation marks because there's really no way to be 100% certain about the traits of the historical figures in the anime anyway.\r\nFor example, (and no this is not in the anime so it's not a spoiler) many people think Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte was short, when in reality this was a misconception due to the difference between English feet and French feet. He was actuallyaverage height for his time. Well, Napol\u00e9on was around less than 300 years ago. The historical figures in this anime are WAAAAAY older than that. So before you complain about a fantasy anime getting historical facts wrong, why don't you complain about SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS getting historical facts wrong?\\n\\n\r\nNow that that's out of the way, this anime is filled with lots of great action, suspense, thrills, etc. It's also got some nice moral ambiguity built in. Not to mention it's chock full of quotes that sound like they should be actual famous quotes. To name a few without spoiling too much:\\n\\n\r\n\"The world's laws do not apply to us, so we must carefully obey the laws we set for ourselves.\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Using a simple method to accomplish something impressive far outshines\\n\r\nusing a complex method to achieve the same thing.\"\\n\\n\r\n\"They call certain methods of fighting good and others evil, acting as if there were some nobility to the battlefield. Such illusions, perpetrated by heroes throughout history, have led countless young men to their bloody deaths, all for the sake of this valor and glory.\"\\n\\n\r\nI also have great respect for this anime in the lack of fan service provided. There's lots of great anime with lots of unnecessary cleavage and/or panty shots; this is not one of them. The only romance included is essential to the plot, and even that doesn't have much emphasis.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying I'm totally against anime that have, say, a scene where a girl realizes a boy is looking somewhere he probably shouldn't be looking and slaps him in the face. That kind of comedy can be valuable to a story in its own way. But it's nice to have an anime with little-to-no focus on sexual themes.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this as a great action/adventure/fantasy anime with some good moral dilemmas thrown in.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero is set in a fictional world based in real life, where \"magic\" is an important element that the characters in the anime use. In conjunction with magic, the magic users also have the potential to summon familiars, who have been regarded as true warriors/heroes, hence the familiars being historical warriors. Fate/Zero delivers a positive view, based on; \r\nStory \r\nThe synopsis of Fate/Zero seems very well done, the characters summon or conjure these familiars in order to beat the 6 other challengers who have also summoned their familiars, all 7 familiars are classified in these classes; Saber - Sword Wielder and one of the threeknight classes, Archer - Ranged Projectile and also one of the three knight classes, Lancer - Spear Wielder, also one of the three knight classes, Rider - Cavalry or any other riding characteristics, Caster - Spell/Magic Caster, Assassin - Sneak-like and cunning abilities, and Berserker - Batshit-crazy-strong guy. Taking these classes into account, we get to see how each familiar deals with each other in order to obtain the \"Holy Grail\", which is supposedly supposed to grant you any wish, and each character and their familiar get to obtain this wish, if they win, by means of; killing all other familiars and/or their masters, of if all other masters are taken out (death or forfeit). The plot certainly gives an interesting aspect to view at, which should not bore you at all, since its a very unique and original idea, this is also before the events of Fate/Stay Night, and if you are having trouble deciding which one to watch, I recommend the release order, which is Fate/Zero, then the events of Fate/Stay Night, and is also even the chronological order. Story is 7/10. \\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\r\nThe animation and artwork in Fate/Zero has improved with its new studio producing on it - Studio Ufotable, in the original anime, Fate/Stay Night, the art was not as good as Fate/Zero, but that was because the original anime did production during the early 2000s, which does not quite match up with today's current anime artwork, but still, the animation and art in Fate /Zero has been done very well, it looks very modern, which can be watched easily with fascination entertainingly, even the anime surpasses most other anime in today's time with the animation and art. Art is 8/10.  \\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\nThe music presented in Fate/Zero is also good, the openings and endings of the anime sounds very nice, it combines various instruments in conjunction with harmonious melodies which is so cool! The soundtrack is mediocre, but the sound effects in the anime is amazing, it sound so nice when destruction is caused and the weapons clashing with each other. Sound is 7/10. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter \\n\r\nMost characters in Fate/Zero have at least medium detail regarding the character plot and their development, which is really good, as most anime do not concern the character's history and their development in full detail, but Fate/Zero says otherwise. The characters are very interesting, and the history of the familiars do relate to actual historical figures, which is pretty amazing. The research done on the characters is magnificent, well done Type-Moon and Kadokawa Shoten, in at least providing character details. Character is 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\r\nOf course, the anime delivers a positive view on whoever watches this anime, as every episode just keeps you on edge; the action, the thrills, the tsundere moments with Rin Tohsaka, some comedy, and possible romance keeps the anime balanced. I can guarantee that you will be entertained during and after watching the anime. Enjoyment is 9/10. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\nUltimately, Fate/Zero has many positive aspects about it; the story, art, sound, character, and enjoyment, will keep you watching this anime, and give you wonderful experiences and moments that you will be able to feel when you watch Fate/Zero. Overall score is 8/10.",

            "content": "If you have seen Fate/stay night then I hope you watch Fate/Zero as well, cause it was amazing. I think it was pretty much more rough then Fate/stay night, but none the less satisfying. The ending of the second season may make you sad or even cry, and the anime might do that as well. The art is fairly different then it was in Fate/stay night, and I can say I really liked it. The roughness of it reflects on the characters being adults and not children, so it is not that much of a surprise that there will be more blood and other stuff.The story is kinda the same if you are looking at the Holy Grail Wars, but different if you look at independent characters. Overall a great anime that is totally worth watching if you have already seen Fate/stay night.\\n\\n\r\nMemorable quote from this anime: \"You saved them, but you never led them. You never showed them what a king should be. You abandoned your men when they lost their way. Then, alone and untroubled, you followed your own petty little ideals. Thus, you are no true king. You are only a little girl, enraptured by a false idol of the king who serves others, but not themselves.\"",

            "content": "Fate/Zero is part of the Fate series, originally a Visual Novel made by Type-Moon and takes place 10 years before the original Fate/Stay Night and the 5th Holy Grail War. This show has an interesting story, great animation, outstanding music and characters, basically minimal fan service and set in a modern day where no character has anything to do with High School. If I want to describe Fate/Zero with a few words, I would say it's mature , dark and action filled.\r\nBut what exactly is the Holy Grail War you ask? It's a seven way war between seven mages chosen by the Grail to participate.These mages are entitled Masters and can summon one hero found in history or legends to partner up with. With the winning team each getting one wish granted.\\n\\n\r\nThe heroes, or Servants as they are known as here, are set in one of seven classes:\\n\r\nSaber, the knight of swords, Lancer the knight of the lance, Archer the knight who is supposed to use bows, Rider which is the mounted knight, Caster a magus of high caliber, Assassin which is stealthy and Berserker the mad warrior who loses it's mind when summoned to increase it's power.Even all the Masters are all interesting and different, like the cold blooded assassin and the insane serial killer, and no one is an obvious main character as the story shows all of them and how they are in and out of battle.\\n\\n\r\nYes, a seven way tag team battle royale with no obvious main character and therefore lack of obvious winner. Alright, some get more screen time then other's as the story progresses since this is a battle royale, and character's will die, because people die when they are killed. But despite that, each character gets their attention. This anime also manages to tell us that there is no right way to end up victorious. Less a clash of good and evil and more a clash of ideals, including the Master and Servant pairs. Some become instant BFF's, some hate each other and some make secret alliances with each other.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character is given a purpose and just watching them interact with each other interesting in it's own right as well as how they develop over the course of the show. And then there are the stand out character's. Most notably Rider, whose charisma easily steals every moment he's on screen.\\n\\n\r\nEven those of you who are only looking for awesome action has come to the right place, as Fate/Zero has some of the most amazing fights ever, helped by the fact that everyone has different fighting style's and tactics, that the fight's can range from one on one to free for all's and mind games, as well as the amazing music composed by Yuki Kajiura, as well as it's awesome opening and ending theme's.\\n\\n\r\nHowever it can get confusing at times for those not already familiar with the Fate franchise as each character has a ton of back story and the fact that you might want to check up on the heroes legends. To be newbie friendly they made the first episode a 40 minute lecture you may or may not find boring. Me? I enjoyed it and it is a pretty good episode to tell you what you need to know and introduces almost every character in the show, so you can't skip it, whether you are familiar to the franchise or not. The first season also ends on the most atrocious cliff hanger which, if the second season wasn't out yet, you'd have to wait a little over three months to find out what would happen next.\\n\\n\r\nI can basically recommend this to anyone since every aspect of it gets top marks or almost so. But if what you want is a more mature action anime this is a definite must watch for you.",

            "content": "This prequel to Fate/stay night offers up quite a bit to make it an improvement over Stay Night in a number of areas. Whereas Stay Night focused on the chemistry between Saber and Shiro, Fate/ Zero offers up a greater focus on the relationships between the seven Masters and Servants seen throughout the series. The series offers up greater interactions between the fourteen thus offering up diverse levels of chemistry between them such as the friendly and awkward banter between Water and Rider, Irisviel and Saber's formal interactions and the strained bond between Gilgamesh and Tokiomi. This focus also expands upon exploring the mentalities andbackgrounds of the characters that get their focus at a number of points with some of the notable characters in Fate/Zero, especially with what we learn of Shiro's adoptive father Kiritsugu.\\n\\n\r\nAs I covered, Saber and Gilgamesh are around in this series and you also get to see appearances from Sakura and Rin as children. However, Fate/ Zero is more darker in its plot as we come to learn of disturbing and tragic developments concerning several of the characters in this series through either their actions or backgrounds, as well as a number of Masters and Servants being quite merciless in trying to kill off one another. Adding to this darker mood is considerably more intense violent content, some of which was censored for the TV airing of the series yet I could tell what happened behind the censors wouldn't be a pretty sight. Expect the twisted pairing of Caster and his Master, Ryuunosuke, to contribute to a good amount of Fate/ Zero's censoring with their violent activity. As a matter of fact, much of the focus on this first half of Fate/Zero is on the Masters and Servants dealing with the duo as their violence on the populace of Fuyuki City make them have no regard for the rules of the Holy Grail War.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Fate/ Zero lacks a proper resolution as this is only the first half to the series as it ends during a major plot development and a number of elements with plot and characters are left unresolved, particularly the conflict with Caster. I also thought that a filler episode involving Rin was a big waste of time as it did little to advance the show's plot or develop any of Fate/ Zero's characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can expect from their earlier work in the form of the Kara no Kyoukai movie series, Ufotable pulls off quite the impressive visual presentation with Fate/Zero featuring vivid colors and plenty of detail in the designs of characters and settings. Most impressive of all is the show's animation used to full effect in action scenes as character movements are fluid and the battles can get quite intense at points. There weren't too many noticeable shortcuts I could find with Fate/Zero's animation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this first half to Fate/Zero was a solid start to the series which introduced its major characters, fleshed out some of their backgrounds, got an ongoing plot from the murder spree of Caster and Ryuunosuke and got a slick-looking presentation to boot. Even though it had some rough areas, I still look forward to seeing Fate/Zero 2 in April 2012 to see more of this prequel to the Fate franchise.",

            "content": "I'm one of those people that went into watching Fate/zero with no understanding or experience in any of the previous Fate/ series whatsoever. All I had to navigate this series was a trusty Wikipedia page.\r\nIt was great.\r\nI'll admit that the first episode was pretty goddamn confusing, and it was especially hard to keep all the names straight in the one-hour first episode. And even though I had a very faint idea of the premise of the Holy Grail war, I was still goddamn confused. For those of you like me, just think of it as a big magic Battle Royale for a miracle.\r\nAs I keptwatching, Fate/zero just kept getting better. The story was normally paced when introducing characters and starting up; then completely bursts into action, keeping you on edge to make the most out of only 13 episodes. There are plot twists and jaws hitting the floor galore, and it is remarkably entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great instruments to the plot. Each is incredibly interesting, from the scrawny Master who'd like to defy the odds, to the twisted, faith-filled psychopath Servant. Above all, they are all noble in their own respect (even Caster for a couple seconds), and the way they are portrayed in Fate/zero truely demonstrates their heroic nature. All Servants have a good sense of respect, even if their Masters do not, and it is very refreshing to watch. The Masters are usually equally as likeable; but of course, they have their underhanded moments. Sometimes it's a moment of badassery; other times it's a coldhearted bitch move. Nevertheless the characters are exceptionally likeable.\\n\\n\r\nI've said this before, but I cannot critique art for my life. All I can say is that the art looks beautiful. It's all very realistic and pretty, especially during the fighting scenes. Well\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura is an amazing composer and one of my favorites, and it's wonderful to see her working with this series. Each track is perfectly suited to its setting, with spine-tingling movements tailored to climaxes and emotional scenes. The arrangements, with an orchestra feel and coupled with guitar, vocal, and electronic influences, just make a kick-ass OST.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Fate/zero and am continuing to look forward to the second half. It is worthy of much praise and I highly recommend it to all fans interested, especially action fans and those in search of a good, gripping plot. It is very hard to give this series anything but a 10.",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nYou know, it's sometimes good to remind myself that anime is still worth defending. Yes, it's a medium that has basically built itself over the last few years on cute-girls doing cute things, and there's no doubt there's some weird crap in some anime that I care not to mention. There's way to much reliance on the idea that apparently every single anime needs to take place in a freakin' highschool, 90% of any given anime that comes out during a season is most likely awful, and anime writers usually fall back on typical character archetypes like the tsundere and suchfor almost every show. And yes, I have been watching a lot of bad anime recently, the kind of ones that make me want to claw my eyes out and start watching Korean dramas, but now today, I think it's time to start restoring my faith in anime again, because instead of talking about a terrible show for once, it's time to talk about one of my favorites. Not my absolute favorite, mind, I think I'll save that for a special occasion(though to be fair if you read this blog at all or know me in the slightest you probably already know what it is), but today's show, with its amazing characters and epic plot escalation, comes close to breaking that steel wall we call \"brilliance\". Too bad it basically drops the ball at the last second.\\n\\n\r\n     Hello people of \"The Wired\", my name is Quan, and today I'll be taking a look at the highly acclaimed 2011 epic battle-royal with mystical heroes and animation brilliance extravaganza: Fate/Zero. Let me take a couple of deep breaths...OK...here we go. \\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero aired back in 2011 and was 25 episodes long(OK, it was technically two seasons of 13 and 12 episodes, but seriously, it's better to just consider them one anime) and acts a prequel to the 2006 action show Fate/stay night. Now if you haven't seen Fate/stay night, that's perfectly fine, it's not really necessary to view Fate/Zero, and besides it wasn't even that good or at this point, needed even. I'll explain. This original Fate/stay night was animated by Studio Dean, however Fate/Zero was handled by the wonderful people over at \"ufotable\", the studio who are responsible for the film series Kara no Kyoukai, whose last film ranks as my favorite anime film of all time. Now, the reason Studio Dean's Fate/stay night adaption may not be really relevant anymore is because ufotable is actually making their own Fate/stay night anime which is going to air this fall, most likely in the same universe that Fate/Zero took place in, and is probably going to be way better, though I've been disappointed before. Point is, know that Fate/stay night is not needed to understand Fate/Zero, and if you like the anime when you finish it, the choice is yours if you want to watch the Fate/stay night done by the same people, or if you want to watch the original. \\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero was written by the one and only Gen Urobuchi, you know, that guy who also wrote Madoka Magica, Psycho-pass, Aldnoah.Zero and other fantastic works, who seems to be currently writing about 7 shows at once? Yeah that guy. The anime was directed Ei Aoki(who was also responsible for directing the first Kara no Kyokai movie), and was adapted from a light novel also created by Mr. Gen Urobuchi. Now, that I'm finally done with introducing the review and the technical stuff, let's dive head first into the intriguing world of Fate/Zero.\\n\\n\r\nIn this world, every ten years, a mystical battle is held that was has been dubbed: \"The Holy Grail War\". Founded by a group of three \"magus\" families, the war's purpose is to obtain the Holy Grail, an indescribably powerful ancient artifact which will grant one wish; any wish. The war is held between seven magus called \"masters\" in the modern city of Fukuki, last one standing takes the grail. To assist in their objective, the seven magus are each allowed to summon a \"servant\", a famous hero that is known through the ages as a world ruler or simply a fairly tale that will be resurrected in the modern world to do battle for the grail, like King Arthur or Bluebeard. Not that the anime actually will tell you the actual identity of the servants at first, revealing said identity to the other magus is considered a huge disadvantage because a weakness could be discovered from knowing the servants origin. So, as the seven masters slowly start gathering in Fukuki City and get ready for battle, you the viewer can start expecting a truly gripping tale of epic proportions that will shock you as your favorite characters are eliminated on all sides, and stun you when the anime actually reveals what exactly it is trying accomplish. Yes, there's a few small problems as well as a huge elephant in the room, but at the end what you get is something awesome.\\n\\n\r\n     One of my favorite things about this anime is the premise; I find the whole Holy Grail just such an interesting concept, and unlike some other battle-royal anime *coughMirainikkicough*, Fate/Zero is able to take this premise and run with it. It goes almost all the routes you could possibly hope to expect, like secret alliances being formed, backstabbing, and plenty of epic battles with legendary historical figures in between. The story just keeps on building scale, creating a slowly climbing upward slope of quality, as the battles become more grandiose and the character's psyches are revealed, which not only leads to a really really effective surprise villain, but also turning my least favorite characters into one of my favorites by the end of it. Here's another one of Fate/Zero strengths which you'll notice when you start the show, there's not really a main character. Every master is given ample screen-time, enough to define their motivations and strategies, and this just means that there's no way of knowing who will be win the war at the end. Admittedly, this led to the master I was rooting for to totally lose the war in every way possible, but still, it's a good concept. And even when the anime does start concentrating on one certain master about half-way through the anime, well, let's just say that doesn't quite end as expected either. But I'll be complaining about that later on in this review.\\n\\n\r\n     Speaking of complaining, that reminds me, Fate/Zero isn't a perfect anime, no matter how much it tries to fool me. The first problem is that everything takes way to long to set up. The first episode is basically 40 minutes of straight exposition on the war defining the rules, and since the Holy Grail is such a lore-heavy little thing, trust me, there are a lot of rules. This really is the most boring part of an already dialogue-heavy show, and even when you finish that television special of a first episode, the anime still needs to finish introducing the rest of the large cast and make you care about them. In my opinion, the anime only really started getting interesting for me at episode 7......which is kind of a big problem really. Also Gen Urobuchi has a bad habit of introducing slightly pretentious themes in his stories when they're really not necessary (especially in Psycho-Pass), but he manages to make it work for the most part here, granted it still made me roll my eyes when Urobuchi starts trying to convince me his stories are deep, epic and mind-boggling. Because they are...so I wish he would stop pointing it out to everyone. Yes Gen, you can write good stories without these pretentious undertones, deal with it and do it more. Granted after, all I said right there, I actually think that the themes presented in Fate/Zero do actually relate and expand the narrative a little(unlike, once again in Psycho-Pass), so I guess it isn't too much a problem, but judging from the amount of time we have to listen to these pretentious themes, they seem a little over-bearing.\\n\\n\r\n     But now it's time to address the aforementioned elephant, and maybe the one thing that prevents Fate/Zero from being a truly remarkable anime. A couple of words about the ending of the anime: it sucked. Admittedly, I don't hate it as much as some other people, but for such a great anime, it's just not very good. It's a shame as well, because while the ending happened for things had to be set up for Fate/stay night, if Fate/Zero had been its own original thing, the people over at ufotable could have maybe come up with something better rather than forcing themselves to conform to the lore established by Fate/stay night. The ending doesn't even make that much sense, throwing curve-balls in the rules of the anime out of nowhere, rules which you would think could have been established in that 40 minute documentary of a first episode.\\n\\n\r\nOK, I know this is quite a daunting number of character(and this isn't even all of them), but trust me, they are all interesting or cool in some way. Since I don't have possibly enough time to talk about them all in any depth, it's time for a speed run of all the masters in no particular order to conceal which ones are actually important, sorry servants, I'll just let viewers discover how awesome you all are on your own. \\n\\n\r\n     First we have Keyneth Archibald, a noble man from the magus society. He actually has a second choice with his servant Lancer, his original servant Rider being stolen from him by his student Waver Velvet, but he's confident with his own skills as a magus, and is also assisted by his fianc\u00e9e Sola. He is very traditional magus, and is thus very aggravated by other masters like Ry\u016bnosuke or Kiritsugu who use very unconventional means to win the war. He's also kind of a prick really.\\n\\n\r\n     Next is Kerei Kotomine, a man who, is for all practical means, is an empty man. Despite capable of being a genius in whatever tree of magic he could put his mind to, he has never been passionate about anything in his entire life, and despite not having a wish in mind for the Grail to grant, he seeks it as a possible answer to his emptiness. What does he truly want in life? Well, I'll leave that for you to discover yourself. He commands the servant Assassin.\\n\\n\r\n      Ry\u016bnosuke Ury\u016b is insane. I don't say that to try to set up a lame joke, he's literally a sociopath child serial killer, and someone who had no idea about the world of mages until the Grail chose him for the war. With the help of his equally messed-up servant Castor,  Ry\u016bnosuke continues to commit atrocities for an unknown purpose while not bothering too much with he actual Holy Grail War, as he follows a personal philosophy that is one of the most disturbing yet interesting things I have ever heard in my entire life.\\n\\n\r\n     Kariya Matou is possibly the most moral person here. He left his own magus family a decade ago due to his disgust towards the whole situation, but is forced back into The Holy Grail War to save a certain young girl's life. Since he has no formal magus training, he is severely under-powered compared to the other magus. His uncle: Z\u014dken Mat\u014d seems to think the answer to this problem is to implant Kariya with magical worms to increase his strength(and also severely decrease his health and life-span), and bestow the extremely powerful Berserker servant. \\n\\n\r\n     Kiritsugu Emiya is sort of the one which everyone hates. He not even really magus, but simply a representative of the Einzbern family in the war, and he uses snipers, bombs, and other modern weapons to take down the other masters, and willing to do whatever he needs to do to earn his wish, even kill people that really he could have avoided hurting. His servant Saber is almost a polar opposite of him, due to her true identity being a noble hero fighting for good, her style clashes with Kiritsugu's by-any-means necessary mentality, and creates possibly the most interesting conflict in the whole show. Kiritsugu views Kerei as his rival, and is determined to take him down to avoid a possible final showdown. He is also assisted by his effervescent wife Irisviel and his \"associate\" Maiya.\\n\\n\r\n     Waver Velvet isn't even really supposed to be here. However after stealing his(awesome!) servant Rider from Archibald, he's chosen for the war by the Grail, and sees it as an opportunity to prove to Archibald and the other masters that despite his family not being even magus, he can still compete in the war. Unfortunately he's a bit of coward, and is constantly being encouraged by Rider to fight, though Waver is determined not to follow orders by his own servant. \\n\\n\r\n     Tokiomi Tohsaka is an extremely powerful mage of the Tohsaka family. He supports Kerei and has formed an alliance with him for the war, at the urging of his OP servant Archer. He's also just happens to be the father of Rin and Sukura, and if you've seen Fate/stay night, you know why that's important. \\n\\n\r\n     In conclusion, the characters of Fate/Zero are as interesting as they are varied, and a couple of them get ample amount of development. True, a few of the masters and servants don't really have much more to them than what they first come off as, but judging from the number of characters in this show, I guess that's sort of understandable. More importantly, they are all fun to watch, especially when the development for certain characters kick into over-drive in the second half of the anime. By the way, even though I didn't talk about any of the servants really, know that a couple of them are complex and cool as well, especially Saber, Rider and Lancer. And paired with their masters, you get a couple of fantastic \"teams\" for the war, and I know you will have your favorite. But just remember, only one team is going to step away form the Holy War Grail alive and claim victory......right?\\n\\n\r\n OK, let's get something straight. Fate/Zero was animated by ufotable. Because of this fact, this animation is freakin' unbelievable. Everything from lighting, to character designs, to environments looks amazing, and really bring Fukuki City to life, and really help run home the whole epic feel of the anime. And the fight sequences...are simply the best I've ever seen. That is when fights actually do happen. Despite being an action show, Fate/Zero is actually really dialogue heavy, and it is really frustrating when so many of the fights end in stalemates. I'm seriously, how many battles must legendary heroes with magical powers have before they kill each-other? Until have half-way through the anime, apparently. But no matter the outcome of the battles, they look amazing, with exciting and creative sequences brought to life with animation that could have come from the golden vault of Xerxes. Highlights of the anime include the Kiritsugu/Archibald fight, which is one of the coolest battles that has ever been conceived, Saber/Lancer, for having brilliant choreography, and a certain battle involving Castor which is just...amazing. \\n\\n\r\nI'd hate to use the same sentence structure twice, but the music for Fate/Zero was done by Yuki Kajira. Because of this fact, it's kind of awesome. Epic, to be more precise, with awesome choirs and violins and the such. Kajira has always been one of my absolute favorite composers, especially her work on Madoka Magica(also written by Gen Urobuchi) and of course, Kara no Kyoukai, which if you asked some people, is possibly the greatest OST of all time. As much as I love her work though, I do admit that Fate/Zero's OST, as good as it is, doesn't really do much  for me. Kajira has a bad admit of creating epic, but very similar sounding music, and I guess I just got tired of it by the time I watched Fate/Zero. Madoka Magica had more distinctive and unique sounding music, and Kara no Kyoukai OST is basically just Fate/Zero's +1. Hell, even some of the music in this OST sounds similar. It's like if you eat three ice-cream cakes in row. Sure, it tastes amazing, but by the third cake, you're just kind of tired of it and full regardless. However, I will give Kajira credit that she has stepped up her game since Fate/Zero particularly with the Madoka Magica Movie 3: Rebellion OST. I guess if you haven't listened to Kajira before though, this OST will do you just fine, it just doesn't do much for me. If there's one thing I love about the soundtrack, it's the first opening \"Oath Sign\" by LiSA which is simply fantastic. It's a shame the copyright hammer has fallen on it, so the actual OP with the song's 90 second segment is extremely hard to find. So instead of posting under here something that had been edited to avoid copyrights, I'll just have give you the actual video with the full song. Sorry. \\n\\n\r\nI don't think I really need to tell you if I recommend this anime. But I'll say it again: Fate/Zero is a stable-mark of animation and story-telling, that shrugs off typical anime cliches like highschool, stupid characters and even fan-service, to become something truly special and unique, and something I can always fall back on when I'm forced to watch things like Boka wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai or Pupa. It reminds me just what anime is capable of and why I love it so much. It's gripping, dark, and looks amazing, so go watch it whoever you are, and as soon as possible. Yeah, it doesn't end the best, and the beginning is unnecessarily boring, but that doesn't really matter, because it's just good. And that's something that isn't as common as you'd think. I've been Quan, you've been awesome, and now it's time for me to watch Kotoura-san, which I'm pretty is the exact opposite of good. Emotionally-scarring more like. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: No Kiritsugu, don't save that kid! He's becomes really annoying later!\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog! (Link on profile)",

            "content": "Let me preface by saying this is only a review of season 1. (if you're curious, I scored season 2 a 9.) Fate/Zero's first season is so stunning, so full of suspenseful moments, so rich with developed characters, that it's ever-so-close to being a masterpiece, but a few flaws are unfortunately glaring enough to pull down what could've been a 10/10 anime to an 8(ish). \r\nStory - 7/10: Fate/Zero does a lot of very good storytelling things. Many of the episodes in season 1 are masterfully paced, gradually building your interest until you reach the end of the episode and suddenly wonder \"what? How isit already over?\" and feel compelled to watch the next one....... At least, that's USUALLY the case. Unfortunately, a few episodes stick out like a sore thumb in this regard. There is the 45 minute information dump that is episode 1, which honestly I think is given more unfair criticism than it deserves, but is still a bother. What annoyed me significantly more was the decision to go with such a slower pace towards the end of the season. Look, I'll be blunt: 30 minutes of different characters philosophizing and drinking is like watching paint dry. Here's the thing: Fate is really, REALLY good at raising interesting questions about life, morality, etc. Where it goes awry is when it acts as though it has answers. Mostly Fate's \"answers\" tend to go something like this: Edgy cynical guy is right, but even though he's right, stupid hero guy/girl still needs to do stupid hero things but hey by the way doing those things is really going to depress stupid hero guy/girl but he/she is still going to do them anyway. It gets worse in UBW, but it's still on display here when Rider starts telling Saber how to rule. What's even more maddening is that it's because of the slow pacing towards the end that viewers are stuck with a cliffhanger ending. Look, cliffhangers are nice... when they're necessary. In this case it just felt like bait. There's also an issue in how the slow pace contributes to apathy surrounding characters, but we'll save that for the character sections.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10. If you're at all familiar with Ufotable's Fate entries, this score should be no surprise to you. Capitalizing on a budget that could've probably bought Michael Bay himself, the animators create a true thing of beauty here. I don't really even know how to do it justice other than to say that the character designs are stunning, the battle sequences are off-the-chain, and by and large the animation is enough to blow anyone away. Fate/Zero is the type of show that reminds a viewer why they spent an extra $100 to get that badass samsung/sony/LG television. This, this shit is why you buy a nice TV. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10. Like the animation, this is truly exceptional stuff. Whether it's the ridiculously immersive and realistic sound effects that are added to the battle sequences, the outstanding voice cast, or the epic soundtrack that gets one's blood pumping like no other (look up battle of the strong on YouTube), everything here serves the series beautifully. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8/10. Fate/Zero starts without an obvious main character, and, for the most part, this makes it all the more enjoyable. We get well-rounded development of every master and servant. I loved this at first because it got me engaged in every narrative and made me feel like anything could happen. The issue perhaps, is that after awhile the trick starts to work a little too well. Near the end of this season I found myself getting apathetic about the battle. It's perfectly good to embrace the fact that characters are morally grey, but when you reach a point where it just feels like \"everyone sucks, one way or another\", that is the point where the switch is flipped and suddenly \"everyone is interesting\" becomes \"no one is interesting\". And that will invariably take away from the fun of watching them. Again, I blame the slow-paced episodes near the end of the season. They managed to make the show go from fun to depressing in less than an hour. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10 - when I look back, I can't forget the shitty feeling that I got near the end of this season, although ending with at least a touch of action managed to keep it from being too bad. What I also can't forget is a show that was full of gripping narratives, beautiful action sequences, and (for most of the time) fun, fascinating characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8.5/10. Fate/Zero is a must watch, despite its flaws. Definitely stick around for season 2, which is even better.",

            "content": "- English Review (Translated version)\r\nFirst of all, I would like to begin this review by emphasizing how absurd it seems to me that \"Fate/Zero\" is divided into two seasons. Okay, I understand that it was broadcast in two sets of episodes, but the time between them (just four-five months) is not enough to differentiate. Please, there are mid-seasons in TV series seasons with longer waiting times. It's not that the plot into the two blocks is very different either, since basically this first season ends with a well marked cliffhanger, so even less I see the point of this differentiation in specialized portals like MAL,years after its premiere.\\n\\n\r\nAfter this introduction, let's go to the heart of the matter: the anime. A very (too much) simplistic analysis would suggest that \"Fate/Zero\" is a combat anime. And hey, we wouldn't really be telling any lies because in essence that's what it is, a group of characters seeking supremacy through confrontations between them. It should also be borne in mind that there is obviously a great deal of background behind this, it is not \"punches for punches\", behind it there is a rather curious network of history. But that is an anime of combat is indisputable from the very moment when there is some episode in which the 25 minutes are dedicated exclusively to a combat and its resolution. I want to clarify that I do not write this as if it were a bad thing, there will be people who are fascinated by the genre and others who are not so fascinated by it. I am from that second group and of course I know that even without being holy of my devotion to that development, everything is perfectly executed and leaves you feeling that you are seeing something worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nAs I was saying, the story is interesting and the development is very agile, at no time does it become heavy. This has merit, considering that occasionally there is also time for long dialogues with a lot of philosophical and moral dilemmas. To intertwine pure and hard action (combats) with something slower and \"brainy\" scenes, to conjugate correctly those extremes, is not at all easy and in \"Fate/Zero\" it happens with an astonishing naturalness.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it is true that where the series really shines is in the characters. The 7 Servant and the 7 Master, all different and all with one personality. Each one with his past, his objective and his role in the story. Also with the addition that each Servant is based on a real character (understood to be real as a \"non-original\" creation), something that I think is perfect because it helps to spread culture and that is always appreciated. It's a pity that, as almost always happens to me, the most popular characters and those who have more prominence in the plot (Kiritsugu, Kirei, Archer...) are not my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial mention also for Rin, who without being either Servant or Master, has a episode exclusively dedicated to her and despite having nothing to do with the plot, is quite good. Although from what I've read this has a trick, since she is starring several years later \"Fate/Stay Night\" and I imagine that the creators did it as a wink/homage. Things about not being a unique story and being part of a wider universe.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I would like to point out that the musical section is remarkable, in addition to a wide variety of styles, from more epic cuts to more classic ones and even medieval melodies. My favorite, although not one of the best known, is \"The Legend\", which sometimes sounds like accompanying Rider (Iskandar) in quiet moments. The opening also comes at a great level, played by LiSA, which is a safe bet because she always does a great job.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\\n\\n\r\nAntes de nada quiero comenzar esta review recalcando lo absurdo que me parece que \"Fate/Zero\" est\u00e9 dividida en dos temporadas. Vale, entiendo que realmente en su momento se emitiera en dos tandas de cap\u00edtulos, pero el tiempo transcurrido entre que ambas salieran a la luz (apenas cuatro-cinco meses) no me parece suficiente para diferenciarlas entre s\u00ed. Por favor, hay mid-seasons en temporadas de series de TV con m\u00e1s tiempo de espera entre ellas. Tampoco es que precisamente la trama entre los dos bloques sea muy diferente, ya que b\u00e1sicamente esta primera temporada acaba con un cliffhanger bien marcado, as\u00ed que menos a\u00fan le veo el sentido a esta diferenciaci\u00f3n a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su estreno en portales especializados como MAL.\\n\\n\r\nDespu\u00e9s de esta introducci\u00f3n, vamos al meollo de la cuesti\u00f3n: el anime en s\u00ed. Haciendo un an\u00e1lisis muy (demasiado) simplista podr\u00edamos decir que \"Fate/Zero\" es un anime de combates. Y oye, en realidad no estar\u00edamos diciendo ninguna mentira porque en esencia eso es lo que es, un grupo de personajes buscando la supremac\u00eda mediante confrontaciones entre ellos. Tambi\u00e9n hay que tener en cuenta que obviamente detr\u00e1s de esto hay un gran trasfondo, no es \"dar to\u00f1as\" por \"dar to\u00f1as\", detr\u00e1s hay todo un entramado de historia bastante curioso. Pero que es un anime de combates es indiscutible desde el mismo momento en el que hay alg\u00fan que otro cap\u00edtulo en el que los 25 minutos est\u00e1n dedicados \u00fanica y exclusivamente a un combate y su resoluci\u00f3n. Quiero aclarar que esto no lo escribo como si fuera algo malo, habr\u00e1 personas a las que les fascine el g\u00e9nero y otras a las que no tanto. Yo soy de ese segundo grupo y por supuesto s\u00e9 reconocer que a\u00fan sin ser santo de mi devoci\u00f3n ese desarrollo, todo est\u00e1 perfectamente ejecutado y te deja la sensaci\u00f3n de que est\u00e1s viendo algo que merece la pena.\\n\\n\r\nComo dec\u00eda, la historia es interesante y el desarrollo muy \u00e1gil, en ning\u00fan momento se hace pesado. Eso tiene m\u00e9rito teniendo en cuenta que de vez en cuando tambi\u00e9n hay momento para largos di\u00e1logos con much\u00edsimo componente filos\u00f3fico y de dilemas morales. Intercalar acci\u00f3n pura y dura (combates) con escenas mucho m\u00e1s pausadas y \"sesudas\", conjugar correctamente esos extremos, no es para nada f\u00e1cil y en \"Fate/Zero\" ocurre con una naturalidad pasmosa.\\n\\n\r\nSi bien es cierto que donde realmente brilla la serie es en los personajes. Los 7 Servant y los 7 Master, todos diferentes y todos con una personalidad. Cada uno con su pasado, con su objetivo y con su papel en la historia. Adem\u00e1s con el a\u00f1adido de que cada Servant est\u00e1 basado en un personaje real (entendi\u00e9ndose real como de creaci\u00f3n \"no original\"), algo que me parece perfecto ya que ayuda a difundir cultura y eso siempre se agradece. Una pena que, como me suele ocurrir casi siempre, los personajes m\u00e1s populares y los que tienen m\u00e1s protagonismo en la trama (Kiritsugu, Kirei, Archer...) no sean mis preferidos.\\n\\n\r\nMenci\u00f3n especial tambi\u00e9n para Rin, que sin ser ni Servant ni Master, tiene un cap\u00edtulo dedicado en exclusiva para ella y a pesar de no tener nada que ver pr\u00e1cticamente con la trama, es bastante bueno. Aunque por lo que he le\u00eddo esto tiene truco, ya que en \"Fate/Stay Night\" es protagonista varios a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde e imagino que los creadores lo hicieron a modo de gui\u00f1o/homenaje. Cosas de no ser una historia \u00fanica y formar parte de un universo m\u00e1s amplio.\\n\\n\r\nPara terminar quiero destacar que el apartado musical es notable, adem\u00e1s con bastante variedad de estilos, desde cortes m\u00e1s \u00e9picos a otros m\u00e1s cl\u00e1sicos e incluso melod\u00edas medievales. Mi favorita, aunque no sea de las m\u00e1s conocidas, es \"The Legend\", que suena a veces acompa\u00f1ando a Rider (Iskandar) en momentos tranquilos. El opening tambi\u00e9n raya a un gran nivel, interpretado por LiSA, que es apuesta segura porque siempre hace un gran trabajo.",

            "content": "Fate Zero reminds me of Game of Thrones, the Star Wars Prequels, and classic American, but also Western-esque, stories. \r\nGame of Thrones has a variety of characters, each with their own motivations and goals which collide with others. It doesn't hesitate to kill characters in order to keep the story moving or give it a dramatic flair, which is a good thing.\r\nAs for Star Wars, Zero tells a grim prequel story, where ultimately, the bag guys win; Kirei and Gilgamesh, just like Vader and Sidious. However, by the end, there is a small hope that lies within a boy and the next generation of mages.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, it's similar to classical American stories such as the Great Gatsby. Zero is ultimately a cautionary tale, just like many classic western stories before it. It warns people of desires and the consequences to aggressively, without remorse or hesitation, chasing after it. In the end, (spoilers), the ones who had no reason to seek and claim the holy grail, survived and won. Kirei, Gilgamesh, and Waver. All others had their dreams or lives crushed.",

Once the mess is sorted out, it's going to be perfect.\r\nI watched Fate/Zero first, back in 2014 when I first got into the series. Afterwards watching Unlimited Blade Works andseeing all the characters I saw in Zero grow up to teenagers.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero took place in Fuyuki City, the main setting for the Fate/Stay Night series where 7 Masters and their servants fight for the Fourth Holy Grail War.\\n\\n\r\nWith the promise of granting any wish, the omnipotent Holy Grail triggered three wars in the past, each too cruel and fierce to leave a victor. In spite of that, the wealthy Einzbern family is confident that the Fourth Holy Grail War will be different; namely, with a vessel of the Holy Grail now in their grasp. Solely for this reason, the much hated \"Magus Killer\" Kiritsugu Emiya is hired by the Einzberns, with marriage to their only daughter Irisviel as binding contract.\\n\\n\r\nKiritsugu now stands at the center of a cutthroat game of survival, facing off against six other participants, each armed with an ancient familiar, and fueled by unique desires and ideals. Accompanied by his own familiar, Saber, the notorious mercenary soon finds his greatest opponent in Kirei Kotomine, a priest who seeks salvation from the emptiness within himself in pursuit of Kiritsugu.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nIn this greatly animated prequel of Fate/Stay Night we see a Mage Killer, Kiritsugu Emiya a notorious mercenary with an idealistic nature.\\n\\n\r\nHis ideals being flawed in the eyes of many,\\n\\n\r\nHe believed in sacrificing one to save ten\\n\\n\r\nAnd didn't care who that one person is or at least, he believed in his ideals way more strongly than his love for any other individual.\\n\\n\r\nKiritsugu would murder even his own loved if he could save many others doing so.\\n\\n\r\nHe didn't care what underhanded tactics it was as long as it'd guarantee him victory. \\n\\n\r\nA man like this was also proficient in assassination.\\n\\n\r\nHis underhanded tactics of assassination made him the Fate Badass.\\n\\n\r\nIn a war, there is no bad or good person. Everyone is fighting for themselves or their ideals.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several other masters, 6 to be exact also competing against Kiritsugu.\\n\\n\r\nWith those 7 masters, there are 7 servants each one strong by nature.\\n\\n\r\nSome weaker than the others but its a game of strategy after all.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nEach master has their own backstory that brought forth their ideals. Some fight for their house name, some for the Grail, some for their ideals and some for themselves.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, the masters summoned their servants, historical figures to fight for them in the Holy Grail War.\\n\\n\r\nBonded by an 'unbreakable' contract and for the same reason to fight for the Holy Grail, these masters and servants wreak havoc in the city\\n\\n\r\nFinally, after all hell was over, a certain magus won the Holy Grail but did something undesirable.\\n\\n\r\nThat led to massive destruction of the city and deep regrets by a certain magus.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nTwo particular individuals piqued my interest. The magus killer Kiritsugu and the servant Gilgamesh.\\n\\n\r\nGilgamesh was a very powerful servant. The most powerful in the series in fact.\\n\\n\r\nSuch a powerful servant would definitely have won the grail right?\\n\\n\r\nThat's what I thought but that didn't seem to be the case though.\\n\\n\r\nSuch a powerful servant was difficult to control and that led to much conflict between his master, Tokiomi and himself.\\n\\n\r\nThat conflict involved another individual, Tokiomi's apprentice Kirei Kotomine whom fought for something else.\\n\\n\r\nKirei Kotomine was confused as to why he was chosen by the Holy Grail as a Master, he who lacked sense of purpose, ideals, or aspiration. There should have been many other capable people to support Tokiomi, so he believed that explanation to be false. It chose him, which was a worrying inconsistency in that someone such as him had no reason to need an \"almighty wish machine.\"\\n\\n\r\nAfter acquainting himself with Gilgamesh, he fully accepts the fact that he feels joy from the suffering of others\\n\\n\r\nKirei betrayed his tutelage Tokiomi and teamed up with Gilgamesh to attempt for the grail.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nThis major war brought forth many stories as such with every master and their individual backstories. Each character crafted with perfection.\\n\\n\r\nAnd after the aftermath of the Fourth Holy Grail, we await the Fifth in Fate/Stay Night.",

            "content": "Simply put, Fate/zero is a modern masterpiece. \r\nWritten by Gen urobuchi, based of Type-moon's Fate/stay night Visual novel and Animated by Studio 'Ufotable', Fate/zero hits every nail perfectly on the head.\r\nStory:  9\r\nFate/zero's story at first glance would seem chaotic, 7 masters with 7 servants battling to the end in a all or nothing war for a omnipotent grail. But with Gen's immaculate writing Fate/zero's story becomes one of pure greatness. \r\n It is dark, entertaining and thought provocative. Different ideals are presented to us and we are all give a choice as to which one we like the most and we can empathise withthe most. \\n\r\n The first episode of the series is a long character piece and we are given all of the characters back stories. The very first scene being set about a decade before the main story, this scene show us exactly what this journey will be It is meant to be a happy moment, a child has been born, and yet it feels very ominous. All the room are large and devoid of anything, the art is dark and sets are sad tone, and finally one of our main characters first words \"Iri, I will be the cause of your death\", this is also very nice foreshadowing. From the first two minutes the show instantly grips you and will continue to hold you tight for the entirety of the show. This is all from one scene so imagine the whole story, AND this is only the prequel to another, that title goes to Fate/Stay night Unlimited blade works or Fate/Stay night Heaven's Feel (note: i did not say the 2006 Fate/Stay night, for i do not wish anyone to watch that trash).\\n\r\n I must also praise the writing in that it was able to link together a lot of the other key elements in the Nasuverse (the universe in which the Fate stories reside, along with Tsukihime, Kara no Kyoukai and Mahoutsukai no yoru). There are reference dabbled in, which for one familiar with the universe (such as myself) will have more to think about than just the story presented infront of the viewer. They can also try to piece together the stories of the other shows.\\n\r\n For all of this praise I have given the story you may wonder why I gave it 9/10 instead of 10, and that is due to the fact that I have previously stated Fate/zero to be but a prequel. Meaning it cannot be viewed as a stand alone show. Which makes we sad, but the also happy that there is more to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 10\\n\\n\r\nIn a the only words I can describe this shows Art and Animation, is it unparalleled (unless you count its sequel, or Kara no Kyoukai, the other series in this universe by Ufotable and Type-moon). \\n\r\n The backgrounds are immaculate and have so much detail, it is almost absurd. \\n\r\nAny scene from this show could be screenshotted, printed out and hung as a poster. That is ho good the art is. \\n\r\n I haven't even spoken of the animation yet. The animation (by Ufotable) is incomprehensible. For a show with 25 episodes (8+ hours of content), The animation does not waver for a second. Every single movement, from the moving of hair in the wind, to the aggressive swing of a sword, the animation is just beautiful.\\n\r\n CGI has also been a huge critique, but somehow Ufotable have also mastered that. So much so that an entire character is animated in CGI (berserker), and he doesn't look out of place in the slightest.\\n\r\n Finally the character designs. The design of the different characters, is as a say ' different', in that you can tell who each character is in a instant. This is due to th uniqueness of each character.\\n\r\n Also the art on the characters is great. Since the backgrounds are almost always dark, the characters face are a white tint, and stand out on the screen greatly, but they still somehow maintain the composer of dark and sadness. This may be because of the way the eyes are designed.\\n\r\n Different characters eyes are used to portray their mental state, a example of this can be one of our mains again, Kiritsugu. When he is shown as a kid later on in the show, his eyes are large, with colour and he appears to be full of life, but then as we see his slow transition into a killer, his eyes become more narrow, and he has no colour in them at all, just a dark grey fade.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 \\n\\n\r\nNow for the sound/OST. Composed by Yuki Kajiura, who has done brilliant soundtracks for other shows such as: Madoka Magica, Kara no kyoukai, .Hack series, Erased and Sword art online. All of which have great soundtracks (my personal favourite being Kara no Kyoukai). \\n\r\n Sadly this show's soundtrack has get criticism for being too a like her other works, mainly Kara no Kyoukai. This in my opinion is a good thing, for the two series to have a soundtrack that are one in the same, it helps us to link the shows together and see them as a entity together, instead of two separates. \\n\r\n Also the Sound design of the show. The sound design for this show is brilliant and every little action characters do is captured perfectly with the sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nFor a show with as large of a cast as this, it manages every character amazing. So well in fact, that some of the least prominent characters are given a 5 minute debate on their views of murder and god.\\n\r\n Some of the main characters being:\\n\r\n  Kiritsugu - servant Saber\\n\r\n  Kirei       - servant Assasin\\n\r\n  Kayneth  - servant Lancer\\n\r\n  Waver     - servant Rider\\n\r\n  Tokiomi   - servant Archer \\n\r\n  Ryuunosuke - servant Caster\\n\r\n  Kariya     - servant Berserker\\n\r\n The great way that these characters duos are designed, is that most them have conflicting ideals. examples include, Sabers undying belief in a 'knights honour', fighting the fair fight, and Kiritsugus belief that a war should be fought with no rules, no honour, and no remorse. He believes it to be hell and wishes to be rid of all evil. \"Our heroic spirit over there considers a battlefield to be better than hell. What a joke. A battlefield is hell itself. There's no hope to be had on one. \\n\r\nThere is nothing but unspeakable despair, just soulless crime we call victory\" - Kiritsugu Fate/zero.\\n\r\nThis quote is brilliant for it perfectly shows the confliction of ideals between Saber and Kiritsugu, showing how much he hates war. \\n\r\nKiritsugu is also one of the most interesting characters in that he is a walking contradiction. He wants to stop war, yet he fuels fight for one, he's wishes to be happy, yet puts himself through unimaginable human torture. And he does all of this so he may one day find a way to create world peace. In the show Kiritsugu explains how he would \"save the lives of many, that outweigh the few\". \\n\r\n KIritsugu is not the only character that is explored in this show and other ideals are discussed, such as the true way a king should act, what is a righteous wish and more.\\n\r\n Speaking of wishes, each character has different reasons for wanting the grail, to grant their wish. This includes both masters and servants.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\n As you can probably tell from this essay I was quite enticed by this show and it interested me to the greatest extent. This may be because of my liking of the nasuverse but I still see this as a brilliant work of art, and should be praised to the highest calibre.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\n Overall, I give this show the highest score and hope that more shows like this can come out in the future.",

Being a huge nerd for history, was it a blast to see an anime that took heroes of our histories and legends (with their own twists) with blinding good animation and amazing characters, was I sold.\r\nSound and music is very spot on and powerful tools in an already amazing animation, with battles sending shiversdown my spine. It's dark and twisted, starting off sweet and turns dark as each episode come and goes.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone that enjoy history, stunning animations and great story, do I definitely suggest you to watch this, or at least give it a few episode of try! : D\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of my favorite animes of all time (at this point and most likely for a long time xD).\\n\\n\r\nFor those that is curious on my reactions to it, can check it here; https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFiDOren6dOVIBJ6URul0Nf4UG3ghdWCs\\n\\n\\n\r\n// Lano",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: this review will pertain to both seasons of this show.\r\nFate/zero is a prequel to the original fate/stay night series. The latter of the 2 was really close to becoming a cringey disaster, while Fate/zero is millions of miles ahead in every single aspect.\r\nSTORY\r\nIncredible, but also the bringer of one of the only complaints I have with this show. The story is pretty much just a holy grail war. 7 servants and 7 masters fight each other for the grail and shit goes down. That's the entire series summed up in 1 sentence, but there is so much more to it than just that. Mycomplaint with the story would be the pacing of it (in the 1st season). It's pretty much a holy grail war with nothing too special about it, and it moves pretty slowly. It isn't until the 2nd season where things happen. When I say things happen I MEAN THINGS HAPPEN!!! Starting season 2, every episode made me want t watch the next.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nAlso incredible, but the other complaint I have with this show. The characters are what made an average grail war into something to be invested in and care about. The characters are well-written, entertaining, developed and intriguing from beginning to end. My complaint in terms of character is the imbalance of them. There are 7 masters and 7 servants. That's 14 characters, and a lot of times (in season 1) some characters are side-lined for the major ones. Starting season 2, everyone has equal development and screen time. If I were to make a list of my favorite anime characters, half of the characters in this series would be on there. I can not describe in words how amazing Kiritsugu's arc is, same goes for Waver, Karya and Kirei.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\nAAAAHHH!!!IUGJGDHTRD!!! It's so f****ing good! Every single scene, shot and moment has the care and intensity of a brain surgeon put into it. The animation in Fate/zero rivals that of blockbuster anime movies, and it blows a lot of modern productions out of the water (which is impressive because this anime is 6 years old). Even if this anime didn't have the amazing characters, plot and morals that it has, I would give it at least an 8/10 due to the animation alone.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nAll of the openings and endings are a joy to listen to along with the in-episode music. I watched this show dubbed in English, and I have absolutely no regrets. There isn't any characters' whose voice got on my nerves, nor was there a hint of hindered talent in their performance. Crispin Freeman as Kirei Kotomine is one of my favorite performances in any anime, rivaling Alucard (who is also voiced by Crispin Freeman).\\n\\n\r\nOTHER STUFF\\n\r\nThe best part about Fate/zero hasn't even been discussed yet. A lot of anime try to be philosophical in nature towards the later episodes, but it doesn't always work. In order to have a philosophy you need to prove you have the intelligence to do so, and have a view that is relevant to real life and politics. Some of my other favorite anime (FMA:B and code geass for example) all have hard-hitting philosophical questions relevant to the function of our society, religion, government and general human tendencies. Fate/zero is no exception. The overall theme of justifications for murder is what makes this anime sooooo much better than mostly anything I've ever watched.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nShould you watch Fate/zero? If you couldn't tell by my ramblings, if you don't want to see Fate/zero then you don't deserve to talk to me. Fate/zero is without a doubt one of the best things I've ever seen and I now think of it as a necessity for a quality life (maybe a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the idea). It's only 25 episodes, and even if the first season is a drag, you'll enjoy the second one. It is very violent so keep that in mind.",

            "content": "First off, let me say that Fate/Zero should be watched as a single series and not split into two seasons. The show was made that way and it is unfortunate that it was split up as the second season is vastly superior than the first. Ufotable has saved most of the good parts of Fate/Zero for it\u2019s second season and it results in a lackluster first season due to no plot progression, barely any exposition concerning magic and how it works, and some weak characterization.\r\nFate/Zero\u2019s main problem comes from the fact that in thirteen episodes (fourteen if you count episode one as two because itwas double the length of a normal episode) nothing happened. We were introduced to the characters, and that was it. There was two major fights during this time, and each amounted to nothing. The fights alone were about four - five episodes wasted. An example of this can be clearly shown in the first fight. While Saber fights Lancer, she is injured and loses the use of one arm. This would make it incredibly harder for her to use her two-handed sword but they do nothing with this. The next fight, Lancer teams up with Saber to defeat the enemy and they win as it is a two versus one. The third fight, which bleeds into the second season, Saber finally recovers from the wound and is back to peak strength. There, that\u2019s it. An element that should have been a huge deal is not used at all. One positive was that the fights, and the show in general looks gorgeous. It was unfortunate that it\u2019s beauty was not backed up by substantial plot progression.    \\n\\n\r\nThe next problem was that Fate/Zero barely delves into the mechanics of the world. Magic is a huge factor in the universe of Fate, but I feel that the anime adaptations seems to be incredibly light on actual information of what it is and how it works. An excellent example of this is the Crest Worms. We are shown them crawling into a character during the first episode, and another person in the episodes following. After the boring first episode, wondering how the Crest Worms worked was the only reason I continued to watch. By the end of season one, and season two we had still not learned anything about them. I had to go the wiki to learn that Crest Worms was the magic of the Matou Family. While I understand that Fate/Zero is a prequel to the original Fate/stay night, many people will have not have played the visual novel. This is a problem because the 2006 anime adaptation also fails to give much information on magic and the nature of the Holy Grail Wars. It is unfortunate that little information was given in the anime, as I was constantly surprised as characters continued to pull out even more powerful magic and to someone who is new to Fate universe, it looked like they were just randomly pulling thing out of their ass without giving any explanation as to how things worked.\\n\\n\r\nThe last major flaw with Fate/Zero was it\u2019s cast of characters. The Holy Grail War consists of fourteen people, seven Masters who control seven Servants. Each Servant is an ancient hero from history or mythology and come in the class of Saber, Archer, Berserker, Rider, Caster, Assassin and Lancer. The abundance of characters resulted in not enough attention being payed to everyone and the characterization that we do receive was weak and mostly basic. This issue is resolved a bit during the second season. One character that I wish got more screentime was Kariya. Kariya Matou hosts many Crest Worms. These worms has eaten parts of his brain, making it hard for him to analyze complex situations and have left half of his limbs dysfunctional. He fights for the Holy Grail so he can trade it for the safety of a little girl named Sakura who will then not have to be implanted with crest worms. Out of all of the characters in Fate/Zero, his story was one that I found the most compelling but was completely sidelined by others which I didn\u2019t care as much about such as the murders caused by Caster and his Master. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, Fate/Zero is not all wasted potential. The art and sound are absolutely amazing; Ufotable truly has brought their A-game. Also, despite their being too much talking for the fights, they still managed to be enjoyable and a fun experience. \\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero fails to achieve greatness due to it\u2019s lack of plot progression, little exposition given to the rules of magic and the Holy Grail, and it\u2019s overabundance of characters. This leads it to be a disappointing experience if viewed as a single season. While I have brought out many failures of the first season, in the end it still managed to be an enjoyable experience. When combined with the greatness that is season two, the series as a whole becomes highly enjoyable and I highly recommend that everyone watch Fate/Zero. It may not have the best season one, but season two manages to make up for it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 (Good)\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you would like to see my review on the second season of Fate/Zero, you can find it here: https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=256303\\n",

            "content": "A note about my scores is at the end, past the dotted line.\r\nFate/Zero occupies a curious position within its own franchise. It is not a position which was intended by its creators, I believe, but came about as result of its own popularity. This position is that despite being a prequel to the flagship title Fate/Stay Night, it has become widely popular outside Type-Moon's dedicated fanbase and has even served as the induction into the Fate franchise for many new fans.\r\nSo I guess this is a review for those new fans whose first taste of Fate (or Type-Moon in general) is Fate/Zero, mainly because I'vebeen noticing more and more people picking up the Fate series in anticipation of Ufotable's remake of Fate/Stay Night later this year. Mainly I'm just going to talk about Fate/Zero in relation to Fate/Stay Night without trying to spoil anything in particular.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing I should get out of the way is that Fate/Zero is not typical for the Fate series. It is far grittier, far gloomier, and far more serious in tone than Fate/Stay Night. For all of F/SN's grim parts, it's still at heart the adaptation of an eroge and is full of romcom shenanigans. If Fate/Zero is your only exposure to the Fate franchise, you are going to get the wrong idea about the rest of the franchise. If you go into F/SN expecting something as serious as Fate/Zero, you will be disappointed. That disappointment won't just be whiplash from the tone, it's pretty much guaranteed because of all the spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe next major thing is that Fate/Zero spoils a lot of the content of Fate/Stay Night. Now, F/SN is a pretty old story at this point and its sheer popularity has caused people who haven't seen it to gain knowledge of some of the more famous twists just through cultural osmosis, but Fate/Zero spoils things for new fans that they aren't even aware are spoilers. This means people introduced to Fate through F/Z are pretty much guaranteed not to like F/SN very much. The change in tone is cause enough for many people to reject it, but the story will be less compelling as well because all the twists and secrets were spoiled in the prequel. This is because F/Z was written as a prequel to F/SN rather than F/SN being a sequel to F/Z. In other words: F/Z was made for people who've already read F/SN while still being accessible to people who haven't.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of effort was put into making F/Z accessible to people as its own story, and I think that's a good thing, but it's also had the unintended effect of making F/SN less accessible. There's a tendency for people to compare the two series with F/SN being seen as the lesser, and I think it's just depressing. Fate/Zero is a good series, I enjoyed watching it and I feel like it does credit to the Fate franchise, but I think it also makes for a poor introduction to the franchise despite all that. Being more serious and gritty than F/SN doesn't make it better, focusing on action and drama instead of romance doesn't make it better. For all its grit and tragedy, it's still only a prequel series to F/SN, so I can only ever think of it as F/SN's popular kid brother.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nI felt the story of F/Z was paced a bit awkwardly, which is nothing new for the Fate franchise. A huge clusterfuck battle early on and then things drag out into cat and mouse shenanigans. \\n\\n\r\nAs for art, I'm not a fan of the filters and CGI, but the animation was gloriously fluid. Overall a very pretty anime to look at.\\n\\n\r\nOutstanding OST and voice acting.",

But ever since Fate/Zero was aired, I will say that I'm having more faith in this new franchise compared to the previous one.\r\nFirst & foremost, the graphic is completely awesome, no doubt about that. Next, the character development is fascinating. Undoubtedly. But what's keeping me interested is not the battles (although I'm also looking forward to it) nor the plot development, but the characters, especially the Servants for this time. The characters this time are clearly a lot more awesome than the previous franchise, and yes, cooler (with a few exceptions).I have to note this -- I do not play the Visual Novel, and I will find my time to actually play one. To be honest, the story does not really capture my attention, and that's the main reason pulling me away from playing/reading the Visual Novels and the light novels. But I would watch the anime. For the great characters & graphics. \\n\\n\r\nI'm currently in my 4th episode when I'm writing this & I would say that there's lots more to expect from this series.

One more thing before i start this it should be known that you do not need to watch fate stay night before this. Even though the creators made it so that you would watch fsn before this you don't have to it will not take away your understanding of the story in any way. now lets get on with the review.\r\nSTORY:9\r\nthe story of fate/zero is about a battle between 7 masters whom are each assigned a heroic spirit to battle for the holy grail an artifact thatcan grant any wish. Even though the story sounds very plain it actually turns out to be quite the adventure with beautiful battles and parts that will actually make you feel emotions. Part 1 of the show does not delve into the story as much because they use it to introduce the characters so that you can get used to them and start liking them. and then part 2 starts this is where you will experience the feels. this part is jammed full of drama and battles but the story at some points starts feeling a little to dramatic and it feels like the creators just put the parts in just to add more drama even though it wasn't necessary however the story is still great. it goes without saying this part was vastly superior to part 1 \\n\\n\r\nART: 10\\n\r\nFrom what i saw i can easily say that this anime was ... was ... was ..ABSOLUTELY FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. in all honesty though this anime was stunning with colors that make you sometimes think your watching a rainbow have sex with another rainbow and cgi that  is really well done for an anime\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:9\\n\r\nI don't pay much attention to the sound quality but as far as i can tell they did a good job. there were parts were the volume would change and get a little to loud but these moments were specifically during the fights so its not a huge deal.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:10\\n\r\nThe characters in fate stay zero are probably the best part of the entire anime. each and every character is so much more different than the other. the characters go from a happy go lucky conqueror to a ruthless killer who wont let anything stop him from achieving his goals. The voice acting was also very well done i watched the english dub and it was awesome and they did a very good job.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:8\\n\r\nNow i know i gave all the other category's 9's and 10's but the reason this gets a 8 is because show starts off but didn't have anything that really interested me a whole lot sure they had there epic battles and all but there wasint anything interesting happening for the first few episodes other than the awesome fights but i still enjoyed it just not as much as part 2.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:9\\n\r\nfate/zero is much better than fate/stay night in many ways i strongly recommend you watch this anime.\\n",

            "content": "Fate/Zero Season 1 Review \r\nThere are no spoilers in this review. \r\nI just completed my watch through of Fate/Zero season 1. I have to say I was so glad I watched it. \r\nMy love of Fate/Stay Night the visual novel helped me enjoy this even more, and the fact Saber had the same voice as in the visual novel was also great. There won't be much that is negative in this review. \r\nStory: \r\nThe strongest part of Fate/Zero was the story. This was also true for Fate/Stay Night's visual novel. It flows smoothly, easy to follow, well written and well executed. It gathers excitement forwaiting for each next episode and brings great entertainment quality. \\n\r\nAlthough there was less action than expected but nether the less when there was action it was well executed. This story is also helped by the excellent lore the Fate/ franchise has. Backed up by known historical characters not just simply made up ones it makes it allot more interesting. \\n\r\nPresenting us with the genuine article rather than just the names I felt. I can't for the likes of me come up with anything wrong with it. I suppose I might on a rewatch at a later date. \\n\\n\r\nTech \\n\r\nThere is not much to say, the art style is good, the animation is of high quality, the special effects are grand and sound/soundtrack are all A+. There isn't really anything I can say to really state how good it all was and how much it amplified the enjoyment of the story. \\n\r\nI have to make a special mention to the character designs and the art work on the cars as well. I was blown away by these particular aspects, and an additional mention is to go to the design of Berserker. \\n\r\nAll aspects of his appearance and execution gain an EX ranking from me, those who have played Fate/Stay Night should know what this means. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nNow onto characters. As I mentioned in the Tech section all their designs are top notch. Especially Berserker. But as Berserker has lost his sanity the other aspects of his character are lacking, but this may be picked up in season 2. Anyway his connection to his master seems to be minimal in comparison's to Berserker and his master in Fate/Zero. \\n\r\nNow in this section there are a few characters worthy of mentioning for excellence. Rider is one, although I disagree with some of his ideals of what it is to be a king, he is a very faithful servant. He is strong and proud of his master and is loyal. These are all great qualities of a man and I am thankful that he is how he is. \\n\r\nAnother is Saber, she lives up to my expectations as a character based off my experience with Fate/Stay Night. \\n\r\nAlthough it appears she is a little weaker willed in Fate/Zero than in Fate/Stay Night, it is very interesting to speculate how this will be built upon in the next season. Her master is also very interesting it's quite exciting to see how Kiritsugu Emiya was through more than just memories and grants me a better perspective of what he was like. But still both Kiritsugu and Saber are still inferior characters in Fate/Zero to Rider. \\n\r\nNow the last characters I will mention are the little baby girls from Fate/Zero who make appearances throughout the series. It's nice to know what Sakura looked like before her transformation, it's equally as nice to see Rin before she became such a bitch too but out of all of them Illyasviel von Einzbern was the cutest of them all. \\n\r\nIt's always heart warming to see the characters happy and enjoying themselves as children. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\r\nIt is rare for a show to really take advantage of all aspects well, characters, story and tech. I find that Fate/Zero is an important example to what anime is capable of when well executed with a solid story and lore. \\n\\n\r\nScore: EX \\n",

            "content": "Fate/zero is the prequel of the very popular series Fate/stay night. But I urge you not to compare the two. The holy grail concept and some characters may be the same but the general style and feel the two anime give are very different.\r\n~Story: Fate/zero starts off with a 45min long episode. The beginning has been quite boring for me but nevertheless it did a great job establishing the story of Fate/zero: introducing the various characters and briefly explaining the Holy Grail War concept. In episode 2, the Holy Grail War officially commences. This series is only the first part of the whole 25 episodeseries.This is not really a 'season', so don't expect a conclusion but be ready to be faced with a cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\n~Art: The art of Fate/zero is very game like. (I guess fate/zero did come from a game..or the artists just wanted to make it look 'modern'.) The animation is very smooth. I really enjoyed the action scenes where I think the art is totally stunning (Don't be mistaken, I am not saying it wasn't awesome at other times).\\n\\n\r\n~Sound: The background music of Fate/zero has always been quite superb to me. It really helps create the right mood during the course of the story. At times when a scene's lighting is too dark, the music really stands out for me. The opening and ending songs were amazing as well. I have to commend on energy exuded in the opening sung by LiSA, it has made me look forward to this anime a lot more every week.\\n\\n\r\n~Character: As I have mentioned before, this is only the first part of the whole Fate/zero series. Instead of having the actual climax, we have characters building towards the climax. The interaction between characters is very important and I think Fate/zero has executed this very well.  Most of the time we will see the characters letting their fists do the talking (well, with the help for their weapons). Since this is an action anime, through the fights we can learn a lot about each characters. Fate/zero explores each character(well, most, seeing as this is the first part, some characters would inevitably be left in the unknown) really well, assigning sufficient time to each of them. At the start I had a small problem trying to distinguish the male leads. But this problem soon disappeared as the series continues because their personality became more distinctive. Each character's personality is actually pretty different from one another in the anime.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment: Fate/zero was generally quite enjoyable. I really like the art style of fate/zero, although there are times when I thought the lighting could be brightened up by a tiny bit. The characters are very well designed. I really like how every character is different.\\n\\n\r\nFate/zero is a anime for those who like fantasy and action. There is little comedy but don't worry there is still some! Fate/zero isn't really as dark as it appears to be(not to me anyway). I don't think you would need to watch Fate/stay night to watch this but doing so might give you a better understanding. I wouldn't recommend it (read my fate/stay review then you'll know why) and I think that Wikipedia does a better job at explaining than the actual fate/stay night anime.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero is a strange subject to look at. It has a lot of weird qualities that don\u2019t typically add up to the greatness that this show portrays. First of all, it\u2019s the prequel to a rather poorly reviewed anime from about six years ago. On top of that, it follows a sort of shonen style of fighting where there is quite a bit of yapping when swords should be crossing. It\u2019s also pretty slow to progress, with very few major fights taking place and very little accomplished by the end.Fate/Zero is being praised highly and I can see why that is, but I don\u2019t feellike it deserves that wholesome praise at this current point in time as it is the first season of what will probably be a fairly long franchise (especially if it keeps the rather slow pace that this first season had). The story is about a Holy Grail War, essentially a tournament to get a wish from the holy grail. It\u2019s a fairly generic basis (fighting tournament) but this old plot device is injected with new blood through the use of familiars, or Heroes, who fight for the people going after the grail. These Heroes are all people from history, (examples include King Arthur, Gilgamesh, and Alexander the Great) and fight for their masters in epic clashes.The familiars are led by mages. Some are from high ranking families, well known for entering the tournaments, some are from the Church (who also referees the tournament), some come from magic school. No matter where they come from though, each character is unique in their magic and their ways of going about things.There is, as I said, not a lot of fighting in this first season. It\u2019s a lot of character building, which is good and really provides excellent entertainment. The characters are all unique and the takes on history that the show provides are great. I was thoroughly impressed by the idea of King Arthur being a female. Some might think that that is just there to be used to pull horny guys in or for fan service (which, admittedly, I thought King Arthur was looking mighty fine in her armor) but the show doesn\u2019t treat her like some sort of sexual object. She\u2019s actually the best character of the show, believable both in actions and emotions, and the history does back up and assert this idea of a female King Arthur.The best parts of the story are when some of the Heroes are put together and have discussions about their pasts and their ideologies. These portions also made me feel genuinely bad for some characters and hate others.That\u2019s the best part of this show is that there is good and evil, but there is also a big gray area where you can either say yes you hate a character, or no you think he or she is great. Many of the characters are in that gray area where you have no idea of their true intentions or whether you should root for them or hate them. Truly, for me, the only clear good guys were Saber (King Arthur\u2019s Heroic name) and Irisviel. And even then, I have my own reservations about Irisviel. The fact that the anime has all these characters and you can have huge discussions with your friends about whether a character is a good guy or a bad guy is a real selling point here.\\n\\n\r\nSome minor problems with the story do include the fact that not a whole lot happens. There are a few deaths, but a lot  of the fighting just results in a character being hurt bad, as if the writers are scared of killing someone. The terminology is occasionally silly as well, concerning the Heroic Spirits. It sounds like something out of an RPG. But otherwise there is not a lot of bad things to say about the plot. It\u2019s an overused idea that comes across as fresh thanks to the Heroic Spirits.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite parts about the series is the animation. It\u2019s heavily detailed and the characters are easily distinguishable. I mean, look at the picture at the top of the review.\\n\\n\r\nThe level of detail in the background is scary. I can point out the copies of Ringworld and the copy of Cryptonomicon sitting on the shelf. That\u2019s goddam horrifying, and not just because I know the spines of books that well. It\u2019s also horrifying that you can detail animation that well.\\n\\n\r\nAs you may have guessed, I loved the variety of characters and the fact that they were hard to guess as either bad or good. I seriously loved Saber, who has to be one of the most badass women ever. My reasoning behind liking Irisviel is due to her seeming innocence and the fact she has a family. But she seems to be hiding something, though what is may be is never discussed. On top of that, her husband, who I found to be pretty badass, seems to cheat on her and treats her like crap. This just goes to prove my point about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I love this show so much: because you know who most of these characters are pretty well, but the glaring mysteries of their true intentions makes you scared to like them. There are only a few characters who you can truly say are good or bad. And except for Saber, those characters  aren\u2019t all that exciting. And the fun thing about this, as I said, is you can argue with me or against me and it\u2019s okay because the characters are complex enough that you can have those discussions. You can bond with one or many of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is a somewhat slow start to the series, but it does provide a cadre of characters that are so exciting and fun to watch, a plot that is old yet new, writing that is fresh, intelligent, and entertaining. It\u2019s the start of something big, something I personally hope won\u2019t end, especially if it keeps the quality that is being displayed in this first season. There is so much to love here, it\u2019s hard to explain to a T just how well done this first season is. If I were to categorize it, I would probably call it Intelligent Shonen. It has all those shonen elements, but maintains a level of class that very rarely displayed in other shows of its genre.\\n\\n\r\nGive Fate/Zero a watch. I think you\u2019ll like it.",

            "content": "NOTE: THE FOLLOWING REVIEW IS FOR BOTH SEASONS OF FATE/ZERO\r\nAs a history and mythology enthusiast, when I read that the show contained the incarnations of King Arthur and, more importantly, Alexander The Great, I immediately made it my mission to view this anime. My interest in history, however, had little room for enjoyment as there is no place for historical accuracy in something so fantastical as Fate/Zero. And so, I put the scholar in me on the back burner and let the child in me take over. \r\nFrom the point of view of a story, it's no great shakes. If you've seen any of theother shows in the Fate series then you are probably aware of the series of events that take place in this universe. What is groundbreaking, however, is the level of animation that has gone into making this show. Each episode with its character designs and environment textures looks nothing short of EXQUISITE. And so, it is if nothing else a visual treat. \\n\\n\r\nComing to the characterizations, each of the 7 servants while bound to the wills of their masters, have nonetheless their own motivations and identities. They are not simply muscles for hire who are told to do battle to the death. The equation between each master and his/her servant is interesting to watch and keeps the overall experience fresh.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the first season begins and matures flawlessly, the second season does loose itself in the backstories of the some of the servants. That being said, the finale makes up for this slight dip in the pace with some excellent battle sequences. The end, however, can leave you with a sense of incompletion as an adequate explanation is not provided and one has to view Unlimited Bladeworks in order to get some semblance of understanding as to why Fate/Zero ended the way it did. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all both seasons are an excellent watch for anyone who likes action with a heavy dose of magic.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero Is the adaptation of a Light novel by Gen Urobuchi. It is joined as one of my favourite anime adaptations of all time, and I feel the need to write a review for it due to the fact that although the series is critically acclaimed already, I feel certain aspects of it are overlooked.\r\nNOTE: For the purpose of this review the 'Hero King' Will be referenced as 'Archer' To avoid the spoiling of his identity, which is a major first season plot point\r\nAs the prequel to a well known show based on a Visual Novel by Type-Moon. I was very reluctant to actually trythis show. Mainly due to the fact that the original adaptation of \"Fate/Stay Night\" By DEEN studios, was in my personal opinion, a failure, while DEEN are not known for amazing animation, the adaptation strayed in short WAY too far from the source material, trying to combine the 3 Routes together into one plot, It isn't a bad anime however if you don't plan to play through the source material and I would recommend trying it out. The point of this however, Is the emphasize my uncertainty like many others at watching fate/zero, I was extremely surprised to find what I consider to be the best anime of the season, and probably the year. Let's begin.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY/Nine : I'm giving this story a nine mainly due to the way the story is woven together as such an intricate mind game between seven opposing party's. Each party has their own ideals and motivations for wanting the holy grail, which is praised as an omnipotent wish granting device, without including any spoilers of course.\\n\r\n The story centers itself around these seven 'Masters' who have descended from a family of Magi, People who are capable of harnessing and controlling magical energy, These masters are 'Called upon' By the grail to participate in a battle royal of sorts, Each master summons a 'Servant' an epic hero from history. Naturally one would expect these servants to fight for their masters without question, however this is not the case with Fate/Zero. Each servant also has ideals and motivations of their own, and the plot is set up in such a way that most of the masters learn something from their servants and/or vice versa.\\n\r\n The central focus of the story at the end of the day is the clashing of ideals and doing what is right. There is no REAL protagonist until the very end with the exception of the ever absent during the first season Kiritsugu Emiya. \\n\\n\r\nART/Ten : There is not much I can say about the art other than it is as near to perfection as I can possibly imagine, in my honest opinion the only anime I've seen that surpasses this one in terms of sheer art and animation is its sequel also developed by ufotable which for the sake of this review we shall refer to as \"Fate/Stay Night : Unlimited Budgetworks\" A well known term which has become all too common among this shows fan base, and a well earned one at that, considering the shows animation quality is top of the range. All I can say for Fate/Zeros art, is : Amazing. Just watch episode 15 and you'll understand. Excalibur!\\n\\n\r\nSOUND/Nine : Same thing goes for the sound as the art, Ufotable did a great job putting the soundtrack together however the real standout tracks if I do say so are Season 2's OP which I highly recommend you check out and even download and the Character themes, specifically that of 'Archer' who's name I won't reveal due to a quite nostalgic reveal from him during the first season. Soundtrack is one massive eargasm and I recommend you all support Ufotable by purchasing it should you have the money. I would go so far as to say that the soundtrack in this anime compares to greats such as Mirai Nikki and even Your Lie in April\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER/Ten : Now it is in this section that Fate/Zero truly comes into its own, the characters all have their own Ideals as I mentioned before and motivations, even the servants from history, who are all participating in this grail war to achieve something they failed to in life. I would class the servants as the best, most well developed characters in the show if it wasn't for one MASSIVE stand out exception, that being the closest thing we have to a protagonist. Kiritsugu Emiya. \\n\r\n Emiya has always wanted to be a hero since he was just a child but as his adolescence unfolds we see that his motivations, although pure can be clouded, He usually prefers the Needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one approach although we see later in the series that although he leads on to us that this is the approach he wanted to take, his true desire was to save everybody, and create a Utopia where everyone could live in piece, as shown in a major plot point which I will not spoil, Kiritsugu is my SECOND favorite character in this series, however my personal favorite has a lack of screen time in this prequel. \\n\r\n Archer: 'Archer' comes across as your typical cocky antagonist, however if you watch and read all adaptations, you will come to realize his motivations are just and he merely seeks a means to an end, this is until he develops an obsession with a certain character, and so ends his decent into madness, he has suffered great loss and bested many trials, however loss burdens him, for he will only ever have ONE, companion.\\n\r\n You will no doubt develop your own attachments and likeness for each character, due to the fact that they're all so well developed and captivating and I feel as though with this particular show it just matters who you relate to the most. however, there is one stand out character who I must admit, outshines BOTH of my personal favorites in every aspect, and if you've read this so far, you'll be wondering why I left him out to this point.\\n\r\n RIDER: Without a doubt, the best character on the show, I'll let you find out for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/Nine : My personal enjoyment of this show was extremely high due to my interest in various mythologies and history. I loved the premise from the start and the second season of this show was one of my favorites to date. this review would be a ten if not for the slightly slow start in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nENDING/Ten : The ending was in my mind, without a shadow of a doubt, the best thing about this show. The character development we get in episodes seventeen through nineteen set up the ending perfectly. and without ruining anything, six words describe why this was a perfect ending: I want to be a hero.\\n\\n\r\nThese categories along with my personal attachment to 'Archer' and my understanding and enjoyment of the source material lead me to award this show with a score of 9.5/10 overall.",

            "content": "I will be posting the exact same review for the other season, as I viewed them as one season. So with that our of the way, I will begin the review.\r\nFate/zero is undoubtedly a fantastic anime. There was almost nothing wrong with the anime, but i wouldn't say it is quite perfection.\r\nStory(8/10)\r\nOne of the things that makes this story so unique is that it adapts to the lore of the legends within it. I found myself looking into the background of many of the 'servants,' which REALLY brought the world to life within the anime. If you aren't interested in that, the story could dropdown to a 7. With a few good twists and an interesting concept, the story is certainly a good one. The anime is well-paced and you will be always interested in its event, wondering what is going to happen next, even though you know the end result from fate/stay night, the journey is still well executed and ever changing.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10)\\n\r\nThe art really is gorgeous in this anime. The colors are nice, the smooth animation is excellent, and the character design is really quite great. However, that only warrants an 8 in my opinion. What really got my attention were the effects. The lighting of spells, the fire, the glow of the sword were captivating. Th effects during battle were absolutely excellent, and that is what brings a 9 to the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound(8/10)\\n\r\nThis may not be a music anime, but that does not mean the music wasn't great. The music itself was perfectly fitting in each moment, really bringing forth the emotions of the viewer, helping you to relate to the characters. Music aside, the sound effects were also really good, especially during combat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10)\\n\r\nTh characters are really what make this anime. None of them feel too typical or stereotyped. All of them are unique compared to many other anime I have seen. They each had an interesting backstory, motives, and goals. ate/zero is what it is because of the characters within it. Th story is manipulated and pulled by the actions of the characters, just as it should be.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(8/10)\\n\r\nFate/Zero was a really fun show to watch. The only complaint I have is the balance between dialogue and combat. I really wish there was more combat, and that the combat itself was more intense. Aside from that, the show at least remained interesting during its slow moments, making up for the lack of combat.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one anime that you will not forget. The beautiful art, a good story, and excellent characters, Fate/zero brings everything to the table. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys an emotional anime with strong story and character elements. If I could not recommend this to anyone, though, it would be to people looking for something life altering or relaxing. If you plan to calm down at the end of the day, or have your mind blown, this is not the anime for you.\\n",

            "content": "I thought you weren\u2019t supposed to divide by zero.\r\nStory:\r\nIf you think about it, the story is rather ludicrous. I mean, seven mages summon mythical heroes to fight for the Holy Grail? If that were the synopsis for a brand new show, I am pretty sure I wouldn\u2019t consider watching it. On the other hand, experience taught me that it isn\u2019t so much about the subject of an anime but about how it utilizes it. And boy, does Fate tell a thrilling story. As this was the first of two associated seasons (something I personally despise), there isn\u2019t much action yet, but the few fight sceneswe get to see are pretty cool. But the better parts are the dialogues between all kinds of different personalities. The clash of very different, very interesting philosophies is quite something and none of them is portrayed as superior (even though Rider \u201cwon\u201d the argument with Saber, that was more because of his rhetoric than him being right). Alignments are fluid for most of the cast, giving the whole thing an extra layer of suspense. Urobuchi once again proves to be a formidable writer.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nFate/Zero has been said to have insane amounts of budget compared to other works and that is hardly debatable. It is fascinating to see what an anime can look like if money is apparently no issue. The animation is incredibly fluid, even movements that aren\u2019t technically necessary get animated, like the larynx moving when somebody drinks. The details are what make this stand out enormously. They even managed to add some GOOD CGI, something I thought I\u2019d never see in an anime. The human character design is kept more realistic (with the exception of the Einzbern girls) while the servants are all very unique-looking and man, some are extremely handsome, damn. Suit Saber is my new fetish.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura is a goddess of soundtrack composing. This, as well as the Madoka one, are the only two anime soundtracks that do the formula that was perfected by Back to the Future: Fittingly accompanying the scenes on screen without distracting the least bit, yet being full of awesome tracks that you can easily blast through your earphones on their own. I also positively noticed the sound effects. Much like the animation, sounds are used where they technically don\u2019t NEED to be, but having them there enhances the experience, like Gilgamesh\u2019s armor clinking whenever he moves in it. The voices were all well done and befitting the characters without exceptions and opening and ending were solid choices with recognition value. I\u2019m \u201cafraid\u201d I can\u2019t find a single flaw in the sound department.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nMuch of the good things I had to say about the story can easily be applied to the characters of Fate/Zero, like the philosophical dialogues. The cast is incredibly colorful and memorable, very few can be put down as side characters. The dynamics between masters and servants is just as big in variety and goes from best pals (Ryuunosuke & Caster), odd couple (Rider & Waver), reluctant obedience (Saber & Kiritsugu) all the way to renunciation (Gilgamesh & Tokiomi). Most of the masters are (naturally) hostile towards one another while multiple servants have quite some respect for each other. Saber and Lancer can even be argued to have built a friendship. Despite Saber being the main protagonist of the show, it is very easy to root for your own favourite instead if they are more to your liking. Speaking of Saber, it\u2019s a shame she isn\u2019t portrayed more badass (which she supposedly was in Fate Stay/Night from what I have heard), but I am optimistic that this will change in the second season. The few that are clearly villains (which is basically just Caster and his master) are just as easy to hate as they commit some of the most horrible and disgusting acts that a villain can do. Despite the rather gloom initial position of this anime, there are some surprisingly fuzzy relationships, like Saber & Irisviel or Rider & Waver (who also double as fantastic comic relief) to ease your mind in between all the fierceness of the situation\u2026though knowing Urobuchi, they will probably not meet a happy ending. The biggest strength is the ambiguity of most characters, making them neither heroes nor villains and wether they are good or bad guys depends on where the viewer draws the line on what is justifiable and what is not. A slight criticism I have is the Rin episode. She is unimportant (so far, maybe the second season will prove me wrong here) for the plot of Zero and the fact that she got a whole episode for herself feels like pandering to her (allowedly big) fan base she got from other installments of the franchise.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nFate/Zero is one of the few anime I plowed through this quickly, which is a sign of quality for me. While slice of life or comedy shows are very easy to binge, a drama or action flick needs to captivate me to keep me glued to the screen and that is exactly what this show did. I was unsure whether this was the right point to start the franchise, as there seems to be no one right answer to that, but looking back at it now, I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was for me, who knew next to nothing about Fate, to follow the anime without having to look up lore or character backgrounds. What tarnishes my enjoyment slightly is the absence of a conclusion, but that one is easily available by watching season two. I would like the second part to amp up the action a little, which I have little doubt it will do. If the general quality can be held up to the very end, Fate/Zero as a whole will surely get the full points here.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9.4/10",

            "content": "Usually, when it comes to magic anime, you usually think of teens who recklessly use it to save the world as the main protagonist. But what happens when you give it to a full grown adult whose only purpose is to win the war using it, knowing how to use it strategically? You get Fate/zero, the prequel to Fate/Stay Night. Is it worth your watch? Let's find out.\r\nStory - 9/10:\r\nThe story follows Kiritsugu Emiya, a magus who was summoned into the 4th Holy Grail war and had a purpose of winning the grail so that he could use it to undo all damage. The waris amazingly executed, with instead of reckless charging, required strategy to eliminate a servant or his master, or both of them. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 11/10:\\n\r\nNo I am not fanboying. I am genuinely amazed by how well the animation was done. I felt different from most other anime I watched, but looked so realistic yet having no overuse of CGI (yes there was CGI, but it wasn't overused to the point of it being messed up). The fight scenes and the slow motion are just some of the godlike parts of the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10:\\n\r\nSadly, the sound is the worst part of Fate/zero, but it's still pretty good, other than the godawful annoying opening and ending themes, \"Oath Sign\" by LiSA, and \"Memoria\" by Eir Aoi, respectively. The soundtrack does bring in darkness when it is needed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10:\\n\r\nThen there is Irisviel, Kiritsugu's wife and partner in the Holy Grail War. Next is Saber, one of the seven servants of the Grail War as the saber class servant, and Irisviel's and Kiritsugu's servant. There is also Waver Velvet, master of Rider who wants to grow stronger as a master of a servant, and Rider, who is rather comedic and jokes around with Waver, his master as aforementioned. Overall, Fate/zero has a diverse cast of characters but I will let you find the rest for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10:\\n\r\nFate/zero is a really enjoyable anime and is worth your time, especially if you are someone who is fond of magic in anime, and tired of the old \"high school students\" cast of characters trend. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10:\\n\r\nYou definitely should give Fate/zero a try. Thanks to the godlike animation (which was just so good I had to give it a score of 11/10), badass fight scenes, differentiating from the \"high school characters cast\" trend (if you are tired of that), and use of strategy in the war rather than reckless moves, you won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\\n",

Like, I would've regretted my life if I didn't watch this.\r\nIt's not a unique anime in the sense of the genre, but rather it takes different approaches to things. I'll give some examples in the format of\r\nwhat I liked in Fate/Zero vs what a lot of shit anime do.\r\nAction scenes/battles are servants having an honorable duel on the surface, but in the background the masters are actually planning their moves out using mind games and premeditated plans. Basically they are interestingto watch and not something like two knights having an almost equal fight until one of them uses their OP power to end it.\\n\r\nEspecially because there isn't really a main character so you can't be sure who will win. \\n\\n\r\nDialogues/non action parts are really interesting too. Because this is a prequel, it is not about character development (aka some child setup with stupid beliefs learning something obvious about life), rather it's about a clash of beliefs from many characters. \\n\\n\r\nAll primary characters are pretty reasonable and you could really get behind any of them. The bad guys aren't people who are dick through and through just for the purpose of being a dick.

            "content": "Anime have changed me in many ways, i can watch all kind of stuff concerning anime in general but there are those moments when \"something special\" comes around to blow you away. That anime for me was FateZero and still today it holds my top favorite. If someone asked me to show them the difference between old school cartoons and japanese anime, i would point them to FateZero. It is serious, mature,bloody and asks serious questions about morale, humanity and dark aspects of our souls.\r\nStory:\r\nFateZero takes place 10 years before Fate Stay Night and tells a story from the forth holy grail war. A warwaged to get the holy grail, an artifact belived to grant any wish you might desire. Of course, this leads several of the leading mage families into conflict with each other. But in order to get the grail a human cant touch it themselves but the grail grants them the ability to summon heroic spirits to fight each other and the last one will be able to claim it. You need to discover the rest.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nFateZero is a bit unique in its setup stage, it does not have a traditional main character, instead the show follows several families and their reason for war and why they want to claim the grail. We then follow Kiritsugu Emya who is a mercenary and works for Einzbern family, which has lost the patience of the previous losses and now wants to secure the grail by using Kiritsugu as a master for one of the more powerful servants.\\n\\n\r\nThen we follow Kirei Kotomine who has been hired by Thosaka family in order to use his special talents as a executioner for the holy church. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, what would a war be without its heroes, the summoned spirits that a grail can summon is, rider,saber, archer,caster, berserker, lancer and assasin. All of them gets the treatment of their past lives and how they effected the history. Some are more developed than others but you get to know something about each one of them.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nIts Ufotable and i dont need to say more, the fights we have here is very well crafted with some of the best animation i have yet seen for a tv series. The lightning and shadow effects describes the tone of the anime very well and brings the atmosphere to the next level.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura makes her presence known by her wonderful music, while i dont think this is her best soundtrack but it is still amazing, i mean its Yuki we are talking about here.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nStoryline may be simple at first since its concept are easy to grasp but keep in mind that this is also written by Gen urobuchi and you know what that means, dark settings, humanity and ideals. I am not going to talk about it more since you need to discover more yourself but i can garantee that you will be suprised.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, FateZero is a holy grail, it made me belive that anime can be so much more than all that fanservice and japanese porn. It is mature, thought provoking, scarring and much more. Some people fight for their own greed, some fight for someone else and some seek a better future for humanity.\\n\\n\r\nTogether with Madoka Magica, FMA: Brotherhood and FateZero, those are my own big three.\\n\\n\r\nDO not miss this!\\n\\n",

However, you should definitely watch this, and here's the reasons why.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story of Fate/Zero follows the events of the fourth Holy Grail War. Just like stay night, seven Servants are summoned by their respective masters in order to participate in a 'war'. The reason for this fight is to obtain the Holy Grail. Only the winner of this war/fight are worthy to touch the Grail, and upon touching it, they are granted a wish oftheir choice. Each Servant and Master have a wish they'd like granted, and that is the reason for them fighting.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is great. It flows well, and it always leaves the watcher craving for more. The story itself is quite dark, and aimed at a more mature audience, so be warned!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art for Fate/Zero is arguably one of the strongest point of the series. ufotable never fails to deliver high-quality animation, and that's precisely what Fate/Zero has. The fight scenes are astounding, the movement of the characters is incredibly smooth, and overall, it's just incredible to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nWhen it comes to watching an anime series, some soundtracks and openings/endings will be more memorable than others. Fate/Zero is the perfect example of this. Both openings for the series are amazing, and the OSTs always fit each individual scene perfectly, and never fail to create an epic or emotional scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe great thing about Fate/Zero is it is made to feel as if there is no main character. Each Master or character in the series is well developed and are all very unique. They all have their own goal and wish they want granted.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the character that stands out most in the story is Emiya Kiritsugu, so I'll focus on him. Kiritsugu has quite a dark personality, and isn't afraid to kill for the greater good of mankind. The first impression you'll get from him is that he almost seems emotionless, and will do whatever is necessarry to win the fight. As the story progresses, more is revealed to us about Kiritsugu's past and what factors made him change and become what he is now.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nFate/Zero is just amazing. For the entirety of the series, you'll be on the edge of your chair as each of the groups are forced to fight each other. The planning that goes into each and every battle, the tactics, and of course, the amazing fight scenes, all contribute to making this anime the masterpiece that it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nWhile this anime may have one or two flaws in it, it is a must-watch. DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY FATE/STAY NIGHT! I cannot stress this enough, the two series are miles apart. Fate/Zero is a great series, and if you're interested in series that always leave you asking yourself \"what now?\" this is definitely a series for you!",

            "content": "To be very frank, the direction in which the anime industry has been headed thus far isn't really good, at least in my opinion.\r\nHowever, occasionally, a diamond in the rough will stand out amongst all the others.\r\n...and that diamond is Fate/zero.\r\nI will admit, my anticipation for this show has been nothing short of \"burning\" since I read the Light Novels it was based on a few years back.\r\nThe fact that the adaption will be handled by ufotable was practically nothing short of \"perfect\".\r\nFor the record, their works on Kara no Kyoukai were nothing less but stellar, but anymore elaboration on it would be another topicaltogether.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the first season of Fate/zero ( Episodes 01 - 13 ) aren't exactly action-packed to the core. A large majority of the screentime is mainly taken over by large amounts of talk; talk that is immensely important to the story.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, all this is heavily exemplified by the very first episode of the show, where viewers are literally unloaded by 45 minutes of non-stop exposition and backstory.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the speeches are handled are nothing short of masterful, with certain scenes even adding in unique touches and nuances that convey more messages than what words can simply do.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, such scenes are obviously accompanied by a brilliant soundtrack, courtesy of Yuki Kajiura. Part of the immersive experience offered by Fate/zero is also largely attributed to the music used in the show, with leitmotifs that will really draw the viewer into the emotional contexts in the many scenes featured throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, the sound effects used in the show are absolutely flawless, giving off an added layer of reality that allows one to fully experience and immerse oneself within the show.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Fate/zero is also a stunning example of beautiful visuals. Taking a cue from ufotable's Kara no Kyoukai, the scenes portrayed in Fate/zero allow for a rather huge use of  realistic ambient lighting from various light sources, giving off a very nice colour palette that will surely satisfy viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds featured in the show aren't your run-of-the-mill stock two-dimensional drawings that aren't pleasing to the eye. Instead, the backgrounds in Fate/zero give off a very realistic and artistic vibe that can lead many to think of as art pieces themselves. \\n\\n\r\nFate/zero also has a very good consistency when it comes to drawing the characters right ( Minus Episode 11... ). Of course, that's mainly due to the static nature of most scenes where there is little action involved.\\n\\n\r\nIn the case of battle scenes being involved, the animation is where it really shines a lot. To begin with, battle scenes are masterfully choreographed. The fact that no detail is left untouched in battle scenes allows for some truly fluid battles generally unseen of on standard television anime,  with examples like the proper animation of a swinging weapon, the reflections of a polished metal and etc...\\n\\n\r\nTo point out, there are also many instances where CGI is used in Fate/zero, especially in the case of animating the character \"Berserker\". Don't be fooled, however. Whereas many shows feature CGI that are jarringly implemented, standing out from the rest of the show in a wrong way, the CGI used in Fate/zero is done with utmost care and detail. *As an added note, CGI is used on purpose in the case of \"Berserker\" due to the way the the character is MEANT to appear (e.g. Alien, out of place, out of focus as described in the original light novel.) in contrast to the rest of the characters. Do not mistake it for a cheap implementation of CGI.\\n\\n\r\nStoryline-wise, the tale of the 4th Holy Grail War is told from the perspective of an ensemble cast consisting of 6 different characters and their servants. An interesting fact to point out is how the servants of Fate/zero are based on the various legendary heroes featured in real-life history itself.\\n\\n\r\nWith a cast of 6 distinct and different masters, one could be forgiven for thinking that there would be difficulty in relating and connecting with all of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, there's room for everyone. Be it a stoic professional assassin who has a soft spot for his family, to a great tyrant who nearly conquered the world, Fate/zero offers a delectable cast that surely anyone would enjoy following through.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that each master featured in the show has his/her own goals and ambitions, with no clear distinction of no absolute evil or good further distinguishes the show from most other mainstream anime featured today. Furthermore, the show also avoids the many over-used cliches in most mainstream media, too, with many subtle plot twists that aren't usually noticed until events actually unfold. \\n\\n\r\n...and all of that, just for the first season of this show. \\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake, Fate/zero is what Terra Nova is to syndicated television shows, with the added benefits of a great story. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, for those who are wondering, the first half of Fate/zero is mainly a build-up to the second half of Fate/zero. Expect some amazing battles, shocking twists, and the dropping of the cast like flies in the latter half of the show.\\n\\n\r\nTAKE NOTE: Fate/zero is currently on a 3-month hiatus to enable the production crew of the show to have sufficient time in producing the second half of the show. Also, the televised broadcasts of the show have had significant cuts (and censoring of extreme gore) here and there to accommodate the 22-minute limit imposed upon the show. \\n\\n\r\nAll these cuts will be added back in the Blu-ray release of the show, with some scenes including more plot elements that were not featured in the broadcast version. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is NOT for the faint of hearted, and generally not for younger audiences below the age of 18. (In particular, the Blu-ray would probably be rated M-18)\\n\\n\r\n...But frankly, I don't give a damn. I'm 14 and I'm chillin' out with this show. \\n\r\nThis review will be updated when the show returns next April.\\n\r\n***The uncut version of the 11th episode Fate/zero will be re-aired on the 2nd of January.***\\n",

Watching a battle sequence was like watching a triple A movie it was just gripping and some of the fights had to sitting on the edge of your seat.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is also superb and exciting for the most part, what i will say as it one weakness is that in places it had some poor pacing and could have lead the viewer to get a little bored and a lot that is right at the start where there are explaining a lot of the characters and the backdrop of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters development like a lot of things in this show is fantastic, as i said sometimes they would dwell on the details for a little too long but when you characters as badass as Saber, Emiya, Kiritsugu and Kotomine, Kirei you don't mind the extra detail. I could sit hear a go though each character and tell you why i liked each one of them but that wouldn't be a review that would be me having a fangasm. What i say is that you will love character, hate characters and it just makes the whole show just so much better\\n\\n\r\nSo should you watch this show? YES. Why haven't you watched this yet? It   reignited my love for anime no doubt\\n\\n\r\nHope my review was helpful\\n\\n\r\nMurphy \\n\\n",

            "content": "Note: This is a review for both seasons\r\nThis was a fantastic series and Ufotable (of The Garden of Sinners fame) was really able to show off their animation skills to the max here. This prequel to Fast/stay Night (which was made by Studio Deen) was leaps and bounds better than its predecessor in every aspect from story and pacing to animation, art and choreography. I watched Fate/stay Night first as I was told that watching it after Fate/Zero would just make it pale in comparison and I think this may be the best option (of course if you have the time, play the visual novelof Fate/Stay night instead). Even though I knew of some of the events to happen, Fate/Zero still kept me on my toes with unexpected twists and surprises. I also learned a lot more about the Fate universe and things from FSN made A LOT more sense after watching FZ as Ufotable did a much better job of explaining things than Studio Deen.\\n\\n\r\nAll the masters and servants get their fair share of back story and development and over time I really started to emphasize with each one of them. The dialogue and writing is fantastic in both the dub and sub versions. I loved the soundtrack too especially the first OP, \"oath sign\" by LiSA. Everything moved at a great pace and I couldn't wait to watch the next episode. Most importantly, this probably had the best action scenes that I've seen in any TV anime series (the Eva Rebuild and The Garden of Sinners of movies are on similar levels) so try to watch this on a big screen.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is definitely a must watch for anyone that enjoys a deep and compelling action-adventure anime. I'm really looking forward to Ufotable's remake of the FSN series (following Illya's arc I believe) that will be released in 2014. And definitely watch The Garden of Sinners movies as ManicB says. You won't regret it.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 for both seasons",

            "content": "Note: This is a review for both seasons. \r\nStory: 1- Just as it says, the story is put simply...pathetic. It starts off with an hour long episode full of cringe worthy exposition. Where...get this...the majority of time that could be used for less wasteful things such as getting us to care about the characters is spent on more exposition, more exposition, and even more exposition. All the while they talk in circles! Oh but don't worry, you'll get even MORE exposition with each and every episode accompanied by cheap forced melodrama and pretentious preaching which holds little to no substance or value. Oh and can'tforget about the dark nature of it. Because dark=good, right? Haha, yeah no...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5-Art is alright. Nowhere no as good as people make pukotable out to be. But it's okay if you like a bunch of wonky CGI clashing with a bunch of crappy excuses of character designs, I guess...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6-Lol wow, can I say overrated? I was told Zero's music was great and...well it's really not. Don't get me wrong, it's good, just not great. Having Kenji Kawai instead would've really payed off here. Still, like I said, much like the animation it's still fine in it's own way, just not as good as it could've been.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1-And now we're back at the actually bad stages. These \"characters\" if they can even be called that lack two of the most basic factors, depth and development. Let's start off with depth, shall we? Most of these characters are either complete jerks or just not worth caring about. Listen Urobutchi, if you're going to randomly kill of your characters for pure shock value, AT LEAST MAKE US CARE! Then it might actually work...Anyway as a result, this ended up as darkness-induced audience apathy. I didn't care about any of the characters, so I didn't care if they all killed each other or not.\\n\\n\r\n Now moving on to the MC, Kiritsugu and oh my...what an absolutely horrible character he was from start to finish. He has absolutely NO redeeming qualities to speak of. A man who is willing to betray his own family (I'll leave it at that as to not spoil anything) solely for his own personal gain. There is literally no reason to root for him, and honestly if I had cared about any of the other characters, I would've rooted against him. And when that happens both the writer and the character have failed in one of the most basic aspects of a story.  However  out of all the characters who originated in this show, there was a small beacon of hope, known as Rider. He was a very good character...in concept...Sadly Urobutchi didn't even do the best he could with him. Oh but don't worry the characters are ADULTS and that's ORIGINAL! That automatically makes them awesome! Again, no...maybe if they had actually been executed in a decent manner, I might have considered giving it points for that but they don't act any more like adults than the typical High School MC does so no...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1-Yeah, clearly I did not enjoy this. After all how does one enjoy something that fails at nearly every corner and turn of the road, and only barely passes in a small few areas? It was a complete and utter waste of time that I'll never get back.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1-So, we've got exposition in circles, cheap and forced \"drama\" and \"shock\" value, a horrible main cast of characters that might as well be replaced with rocks, along with mediocre animation and music. Now compile all that with a story that tries so hard to be dark and doesn't end up as anything but laughable instead and you have yourself the big old waste of time that is known as Fate/Zero. This really does NOT live up to the undeserved hype. So if you haven't seen this yet, do yourself a favor, and AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS. Watching this would be a mistake and a horrible idea.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fate/Zero revisits the universe of Fate/Stay Night, this time as a prequel taking place during the previous Holy Grail war. Interestingly enough, despite being a prequel, I highly advise watching FSN first, as a lot of the concepts of the Fate universe are better explained there; and you'll enjoy many more *omg I cannot believe [insert event here] happened* moments. Much of the remainder of the review will use FSN as a reference point.\r\nThere are two \"seasons' worth of episodes though it is really one contiguous story rather than two sub parts. Fate/Zero feels like a much more mature and dark version of FSN. Mostof the protagonists are much more mature, and quite dark in demeanor. Don't expect a lot of fights, in place of the weapon spamming you have intricate relationships and complicated plans; all ripe for betrayals and twists.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is a very involved watch; there are so many side stories and plotting and counter-plotting, many of which take place during complicated dialogues. However, I felt it was a very worthwhile watch both in addressing some of the questions in FSN as well as standing in it's own right. Despite already knowing how the war would end, I was still immensely captivated by the intricacies of the masters' attempts to win the grail.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an involved and extremely well animated series with a slightly dark overtone, definitely check this one out.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nUfotable has come out with some immensely impressive animations, Kara no Kyoukai being the strongest impression. They do not disappoint here. Fate/Zero is bathed in a gorgeous palette, highlighting the dark, gloomy outlook for many of the masters and the city as a whole. Everything from the fluid fight sequences to the superb usage of color effects and shadows is well done, and many levels above what I was in FSN. One of the most memorable scenes for me was at the very end of the first season where Velvet and Rider were having a conversation under a setting sun. If you missed it, I highly recommend re-watching for it as it is one of the most convincing and fluid sunsets I have seen in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, there are a lot of older men in this series than FSN. I guess they sort of balance it out by having loli Rin Tousaka and an even smaller Ilia. In any case, one of the early challenges in this series for the viewer would be to figure out how to discern Emiya Kiritsugu from Kotomine Kirie- as both have deep voices and the look of death on their face. As far as consistency goes, Saber and Archer keep their appearance from FSN (though Saber dons a bodyguard suit rather than her casual attire). Lancer is a harder one as his outfit is in my opinion far superior to the one he dons in FSN.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has a lot of blood and a significant amount of random slaughter, though the camera does pull away at the most grueling moments. This is much too dark of a series to have significant ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nDespite the huge upgrade in animation quality, I don't believe the music in FZ was as catchy as that in FSN, though the quality in general was still very good. There is an OP and ED per season. All the pieces are fitting for the series tone but I didn't really like either of the OP melodies (sorry Kalafina). The EDs on the other hand were both good, especially the second series ED by newcomer Lunamaria er... Luna Haruna, composed by Yuki Kajiura.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is superb, my only complaint being that Kirie and Emiya sound too alike (though it may very well be on purpose). The VAs for the heroic spirits from the 4th Grail War pick up their corresponding roles here- and Kana Ueda even returns to voice chibi Rin! All the voices were appropriate given their character personalities, though I do believe Lancer turned out to be much more of a \"heroic\" figure in FZ.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nFate/Zero is a pretty focused series, set aside the two-episode adventure through Kiritsugu's past and loli Rin's adventure. While the obvious plot line is the battle for the holy grail, the series spends a lot of time following each individual master as they plot and plan their next move. It really makes you wonder how Shirou lasted so long in FSN... In any case, the entire story is pretty much seeing how each master's plan weaves with each other- this is the fun, figuring out which plan will win the day or how someone's plan will be ruined.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of tonality, F/Z is much more in line with that of Kara no Kyoukai than FSN. Gone are the humor relief moments and teenage crushes, replaced by a single-minded purpose of winning the war. Likewise, in terms of scale, the masters and servants of F/Z seem far superior in ability and talent than their counterparts in FSN.\\n\\n\r\nThere are numerous plot twists, many of which are masterfully executed, putting lots of other recent series to shame. The series does (eventually) build to a final climax, bringing the clock back to \"zero\" and thus setting the stage for what happens in FSN. It is a very well rounded storyline though a few answers do go unanswered near the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIf you've watched FSN, be ready for a lot of early surprises, character-relation wise. Fate/Zero focuses quite heavily on some of the character relationships and does a great job fleshing out the backgrounds of some of the masters and servants, while leaving others shrouded in a veil of mystery. While giving some more background on some of the supporting characters would have made their eventual demise more impact, perhaps they felt the series was long enough already. I was particularly keen on the large amount of time spent on the Velvet/Rider relationship, especially considering their relative unimportance for FSN.\\n\\n\r\nThere is an interesting tension between many of the servants and masters, as their fundamental beliefs in how one should behave clash at multiple points. It is very interesting to see how these mismatches affects each pair's fate. However, most interesting to me was how the characters related to one another, and especially how those ties related to the masters in FSN.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual main characters are all very strong. Each master and servant have very memorable and distinct personalities. In particular, it was interesting to see Kiritsugu's dark notion of justice, ironically passed on to Shirou in a much more \"hopeful\" spirit.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nFate Zero is hands down the series to watch in its season/s. It combines great tonality and animation with superb directing to create a piece that you'll definitely remember.",

Thank you Ufotable.\r\nOk, Fate/Zero. Unlike Fate/Stay Night first series, which cameo out from Studio Deen, Fate/Zero was designed under my favourite anime production centre; Ufotable, who gave us Kyoukai no Kara.\r\nWhat can I say about the graphic. What can I say about the Arts? It is brilliant as usual. Crazy CG works (Money Works), amazing character design (Money Design)... Everything was too perfect.\r\nSo why didn't I gave it 10 out of 10 you ask? Well, it definitely deserves a spot on10 out of 10 anime for my list, that is true...... But I couldn't stop but to think 'With such budget, designers, story, characters, sound works Ufotable had, couldn't have they gave us something more?'\\n\r\nMay be I am being greedy. However, That was my honest opinion of Fate Zero.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended for anyone really. You won't be able to close your jaws due to its amazing graphic.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it for Fate/Zero!\\n\\n\r\nSayonara!",

            "content": "Fate/Zero\r\n\"Fate/Zero\" is the prequel of the HIT TV Anime Series \"Fate/Stay Night\" back in 2006. Now when we say \"Prequel\", it means that it was the story before the \"Fate/Stay Night\" series happened. \"Fate/Zero\" is about the untold story of the \"Fourth Holy Grail War\". It features some of \"Fate/Stay Night\" characters like; Rin Tohsaka, Sakura Matou, Emiya Kiritsugu, Kotomine Kirei, Gilgamesh, and of course Saber about their Past experiences of the \"Fourth Heaven's Feel\".\r\n\"Fate/Zero\" and \"Fate/Stay Night\" really have big differences from one another. \"Fate/Stay Night\" was produced by \"Studio DEEN\" and was adapted from the visual novel game with the same title madeby Nasu Kinoko and produced by TYPE-MOON while \"Fate/Zero\" was produced by \"ufotable\" and was adapted from the light novel with the same title written by Urobuchi Gen. So, will a prequel story made by a different person from the original creator work? When we look at it, it really looks kind of complicated. But when I read the \"Fate/Zero\" light novel (I'm currently 80% finished on the 3rd volume, there are 4 volumes), it kinda looked convincing that this really is the prequel story of \"Fate/Stay Night\", and I didn't even saw any conflicts on the storyline from \"Fat/Zero\" to \"Fate/Stay Night\".\\n\\n\r\n\"Fate/Zero's \" opening theme song was performed by LiSA who is well known for her performances for the anime \"Angel Beats!\" (Gldemo Rocks!), it is so great that it is one of my favourite songs that I'm currently listening on my iPod right now.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is really going to be too brutal and bloody when the story continues on. But just like any other light novel adapted anime, I'm sure that the violence and mature content will be lessen.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching just 3 episodes of \"Fate/Zero\", I already gave it a score of 10! Even though the ending of this anime is obvious, there are still a lot of scenes and battles for Revenge, Glory, Conquest, Pride, and Honour for the Holy Grail to watch for. Right now I can definitely say that \"Fate/Zero\" may not be the most anticipated anime of 2011 (Shakugan no Shana Final is), but I can definitely say that this is the best anime of 2011.\\n",

(Kiritsugu its the bigger example) The duality of justice and salvation, the clash of ideologys of the Servants and beetween Kiritsugu and Kirei its a incredible masterpiece.  Of begin to the end Fate/Zero is wonderful. Watch this.\r\nOBS: Saber is the best girl. Kirei it'sa badass antagonist, Sorry UBW, but this Rider its amazing.",

Something a great many other animes are guilty of, but few escape.\r\nThe characters were well fleshed out when they needed to be, and at other times characters that weren't so important would be needlessly fleshed out in a way that was still enjoyable and entertaining. Something marvelouslydone since a fairly major portion of the character development went towards someone that had virtually no impact on the story in any way whatsoever. The other characters remained vague enough to be interesting yet fairly unpredictable while also being predictable at the same time in their choices.\\n\\n\r\nJust simply an enjoyable anime that made me reluctant to watch the Fate/Stay Night original, considering that UBW and this(Fate/Zero) are widely considered leagues better.",

            "content": "When you see a title that is in production under the name of Ufotable studios, you will realize that you will have an outstanding series in terms of graphics, art, and animations. The well-known anime series Fate/Zero is no exception. This series takes you to a beautiful world that is full of action, supernatural, magic, and fantasy. With the help of a well-made story and dialogues, prepare yourself and your mind to take this experience.\r\nAt first, you'll be a little bit confused about the story. I, myself, have repeated the first episode twice so I can comprehend the story. The story talks about a \"HolyGrail War\" that has happened 3 times previously in the past. With the promise of granting any wish to the victor of this war, the wealthy Einzbern family is confident that the Fourth Holy Grail War will be different; namely, with a vessel of the Holy Grail now in their grasp. Solely for this reason, the much hated \"Magus Killer\" Kiritsugu Emiya is hired by the Einzberns, with marriage to their only daughter Irisviel as a binding contract.\\n\\n\r\nWith this, Kiritsugu Emiya and his familiar, Saber have to face 6 other participants, each has an ancient familiar, and fueled by unique desires and ideals. These ancient familiar are unique and each has its own class and power.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in this series are great! The fighting scenes are well animated, the environment is well-made too. However, there were series that are made by Ufotable which have a better animation and art. So, I'm somewhat disappointed with this. But it's still Ufotable did a good job in handling the art and animation. The long and somehow complex dialogues make the anime hard to follow; which makes this one of the negative points in the anime. The cliffhanger that ended the first season of the series was somehow annoying; it felt like the first season of the series was only some kind of advertisement for the light novel. So, I'm excited to start watching the second season of this series hoping that it will be better than the first one. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, Fate/Zero is a series that will make your mind work all day while you're watching it; trying to analyze and comprehend the story. You will also enjoy the beauty of the fighting scenes, and the beauty of Ufotable studios work.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rate: 8/10",

            "content": "Abridged version of this review is at the bottom under \u201cconclusion\u201d. This is fairly detailed report considering I left our specifications to avoid spoiling anything.\r\nFate/Zero season 1 is a very strong start. It has lots of action, intriguing characters and amazing music. This is a gemstone in the fate series and definitely a strong stand alone series.  You do not NEED to watch Fate Stay Night from 2006 to appreciate this anime. This is an addictive anime that will have you watching episode after episode. \r\nCool Note: I honestly prefer the English Dub over English Sub for this anime. The dub gives a moreauthentic feel to the servants. Somehow, larger than life historical figures (primarily from Europe) lose something English sub since I don\u2019t think there are any difference in accents.  This may just be due to that I find it easier to detect accents in my native language. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 7-8\\n\r\nThe story is not the most complex. The general premise is basically outlined in episode 1. That said, it is a thrilling story that is both more unpredictable and more entertaining than many of its genre. The plot isn\u2019t strangled by plot armor, and, due to the interesting and sentient characters, the plot never runs out of surprises. The first season sets up for an exhilarating season 2.  \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7-9???\\n\r\nNo expert on art. Nothing hurts my eyes in this series. All the servants are cool and the art helps define the mood and characters. As most of the servants are note worthy historical figures (or are supposed to represent them) the art helps authenticate their characters to a greater degree. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9-10\\n\r\nVery, very good. Easy to listen to and I enjoyed the opening theme a lot. The ost is strong. This is easily better than your average anime\u2019s music track and deserves some recognition. The only real criticism I have read about the music is that it is \u201cnot impressive enough\u201d and in all honesty, that\u2019s probably due to HEAVY overestimation of this series. The music is something that deftly manipulates the atmosphere and contributes a layer of depth and seriousness that wouldn\u2019t exist otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters, and I think most people who say his is a weak category want more characters to be developed. I think this is easily the strongest category since the plot, music, art, and general enjoyment revolves around the characters. There are characters that get neglected, but almost all the characters change or are given greater depth as the anime progresses. There are plenty of battle royal or tournament style anime where the characters receive negligible character development when compared to a masterpiece like this (examples being Hunter X Hunter Heavan\u2019s Arena Arc, Girls Und Panzer, Asterix Wars...). Why should someone watch this anime? They should watch it because of the unique, intriguing, and intelligent characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10 \\n\r\nThere are anime that turns watching \u2018only one episode\u2019 into \u2018only watching two episodes\u2019 and then several hours later, you complete the anime and want more. This is one of those anime. One of the strongest character anime that is fast paced and really sets up for season 2 to allow each character to shine. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion - I think this is a strong 9 that ultimately rounds up to a 10 due to this only Being season 1. If you like action, magic, scheming, thrill, and tragedy this is a good anime for all the aforementioned categories. I personally love this particular series (the Fate/Zero series) for the intricate and amazing characters!  If you are looking for light hearted humor, \\n\r\nsilly characters, or realism (if you want realism, anime may not be for you...but I hear Gosick is a good detective anime so maybe give that a try? Zankyou No Terror is thrilling yet surprisingly realistic) you may want to choose another anime.\\n\\n\r\nP.s. Please don\u2019t watch this (or any) anime with high expectations. No anime can measure up to the imagination or creativity of the human mind.",

            "content": "This review is for both seasons. Fate/Zero, which I saw before Fate/stay night and UBW, is awesome. A fight to the death among ancient heroes given life for this very purpose, who serve masters, each with his or her motivations for obtaining the Holy Grail. May sound like stereotypical battle royale to you, but then again, this anime is pretty well known and you're probably reading this review because you know of its repute. For it is awesome.\r\nufotable does it again. As I said for God Eater, ufotable is a superb studio. The characters have a fine quality of sketching that is not too sharpnor too colored, but just in between. One of the best-animated anime, undoubtedly.\\n\\n\r\nSound. LiSA's legendary opening \"oath sign\" and a brilliant soundtrack make this even more enjoyable. Operatic vocals punctuate the fight scenes -- which are awesome too, quick and furious and bloody realistic like fights should be -- with a rolling thunder of symphonic majesty. The themes in this anime are pretty dark in hindsight, in comparison to other anime. A lot of blood is spilled, and betrayal and trickery go hand in hand. Is Kiritsugu Emiya justified in how he fights this war? He is quite the character in that he has quite the sad backstory and I just love the spiky hair. Kinda like that of Lenka Utsugi in God Eater. This is the chronological prelude to the events of Fate/stay night, so I recommend seeing this first, although fans may tell you to do otherwise. This way you know the past at the beginning, and see how it influences Shirou Emiya's motivations in his time. Plus if you see Fate/stay night first the ending of Fate/Zero is revealed.\\n\\n\r\nYou have these Servants, each of a certain class, to fight in this Holy Grail War. Lancer, who uses a red sturdy lance with eye-aweing skill. Saber, swordswoman, superb as well. Rider, the horseman whose physicality is undoubted. Assassin, the surreptitious killer in the shadows. Archer, commander of a mighty arsenal of weapons from times past. Berserker, brute force manifested. Caster, the sanctified agent of God to spill blood with his foul creatures and ancient book. Who will triumph in this war? What exactly is the Holy Grail? Why do they fight?\\n\\n\r\nHighly entertaining, as the plot is purely combat-based. Has some of the best fight scenes you will ever encounter in anime.\\n\\n\r\none word to describe this anime: poignant",

Pissing on Gen aside, it is a fun show if you purposefully ignore some of the \"small\" problems like the bullshit debate of king's banquet, the edgy misused philosophy of the train track problem and the fact for a \"battle royal\"there isn't much fucking tactics involved in it.

So a bunch of ignorant magus host the fourth war, featuring Kiritsugu \"Muh ideal\" emiya, Tokinomi \"I'm full of flags\" Tohsaka, Kirei \"Rejoice\", Waver \"the only one who act like a person\", Kariya \"Suffering\", the comedic murder and a moron who was winging it and got killed.\\n\\n\r\nYes, I do have a pretty low opinion of Zero masters besides Waver, who seems to be the only one who want to win and understands that you need a healthy relationship with your servant to do so. Even if you don't win you still get something out of this experience, something that seems to fly over the head of most masters except for ryuunosuke and later on kirei (who was also the other master that got a happy ending).\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, a bunch of fighting occurs, cup blows up, go watch FSN. FZ does wrap up most of the plot lines while leaving some for the Sequel-prequal.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8 or 4 depending on character\\n\\n\r\nFZ character are into two tiers, those that are written well, and those that aren't.\\n\\n\r\nGood: Waver, Rider, Kirei, Iri, the comedic caster duo\\n\\n\r\nMediocre to bad: Everyone else\\n\\n\r\nThis is because, Gen kind of reduced everyone else to mouthpieces or plot devices, like poor Assassin (poor Zayd, King Hassan is going to kill him/her for performing so badly in this war). Especially Kiritsugu and Saber, who both got turned really awfully childish in some ways. Arturia wan't really that strict to Knight's ideal, and did a lot of underhanded tactics, which is why Tristan said \"King didn't understand hearts\" in the first place (and Tristan's words are not a good measurement in Nasuverse, neither is Lancelot's words). So kind of OOC for fans of other fate works, it is amazing that Gen got the duo through the war using plot armour, considering a relationship this bad is pretty much suicide for a master-servant pair.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, enjoy some ignore others, anytime a character spews amateur philosophy turn off your brain.\\n\\n\r\nArt,Music - 9\\n\\n\r\nGood, no other words are needed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\\n\r\nFun pretentious work, okay as a standalone, some problems as a fate entry. Overall, it is an okay time spent, you would probably only regret wasting half of your time on this mess.",

I like how Ufotable tries to mix CGI's with anime style and they do it right. The store is simply amazing follows through good patterns. The artwork is also outstanding coming from Ufotable there is nothing to say but a solid ten. The series has a good and rich character development. Overall I really enjoy this anime and Fate is now one of my favourite series an absolute must watch!",

And I guess we have to mention Archer (Gilgamesh) who also makes his appearance in FSN.My most hated one was Caster cause he's just sick :D The story is well thought and made.\\n\r\nThis anime was the first action and fantasy anime that I watched and I was totally hooked.It's one of the best anime I've seen and its definitely worth watching.\\n\r\nI love both opening themes.LiSA's Oath sign is why I started watching and the Kalafina songs are also epic and fit nicely.I don't know why the creators decided to make king Arthur a girl (Saber) but she is awesome-also one of my favorite characters :) I hoped this helped you and make sure to watch FZ as well was FSN!",

            "content": "SYNOPSIS: Fate/Zero takes place 10 years prior to the events of Fate/stay night, detailing the events of the 4th Holy Grail War in Fuyuki City. The War of the Holy Grail is a contest in which seven magi summon seven Heroic Spirits to compete to obtain the power of the \"Holy Grail,\" which grants a miracle. After three inconclusive wars for the elusive Holy Grail, the Fourth War commences.\r\n(SOURCE: myanimelist.net)\r\nI am very happy that I made the choice to watch Fate/Zero, my friends recommended Fate/Zero to me just a few days ago and I'm very glad that I made the choice to watch it.\r\nIf youwere to ask me to describe Fate/Zero in one word I would respond with interesting. When I was watching Fate/Zero, the series kept me entertained and as well interested in how will the events turn out. Just after a few episodes after the war started. I was trying to figure out what were they up to and their plans to winning the holy grail war and as well the name of the servants' master.\\n\\n\r\nI was glad that the series wasn't rushed, they were showing us viewers what point-of-view of each character has in winning the grail war. So I really liked how the series started slow. So I will give a score of 10 in the plot without doubts.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was pretty, the use of colors and how they blended in everything was perfect. For example the sword of the King of Knights is simply beautiful that it gives me chills. :O\\n\\n\r\nEach character in the series were made thoroughly, what I mean to say is that each character in Fate/Zero has it's own personalities that makes it entertaining and keeps you to watch. There are villains, good guys, the serious one, and the one who doesn't know why he's in the Holy Grail War.\\n\\n\r\nNo doubts, I enjoyed watching Fate/Zero, I did not get bored or anything, I just kept on watching and finished the first season in a day. Now I'm almost finished watching the season two of Fate/Zero. I have yet to watch Fate/Stay Night. But I really recommend you to watch Fate/Zero, you will not regret it. :)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE: 10/10",

Everything could become very confusing, but they didn't. Everything was understandable andawesome!\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: There isn't anything for me to say as i am, literally, out of words. I will only say this:  Sometimes i had to *replay scenes* in order to check if what i saw was real. I just can't believe the work they've put on this show...\\n\r\nSame fact applies for sound quality. Thankfully, i had the chance to enjoy the music and sound effects with home cinema equipment, and it was what the internet says: an eargasm.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I was already excited by the idea of summoning historical figures who were bound to have their own special and unique character followed by an extreme amount of badassity. It was even more fulfilling to see that their Masters were no wussies or some neutral pokerfaces who only knew how to summon and control a Servant. Even MORE significant was the fact that those Heroic Spirits weren't summoned just to fight each other...... ok that was the idea, but what they also did? They shared ideals with their Masters. Stories from their eras. Philosophies. Some helped each other learn about themselves. A true accomplishment. Indeed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Hahaha! Oh right! Have i told you that every Heroic Spirit has a trump card? Yea, it's called Noble Phantasm. It's basically an Ultimate Attack, in a video game's way of explanation. So. When the first one was introduced, i was like \"Oooh! Nice...\", then the second \"Wow! Sweet!\", and at the last one... \"HORY SHEEEEET! EPICNESS OVERLOAD! Somebody call a doctor, i'm having a heart attack!!!\". My body was overflowing satisfaction. No exaggerations!\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Nough said...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS. I guess my only complaint would be the lack of more and longer battles, but that is to be overlooked as it is expected from the 2nd season. :3\\n\r\nBesides, the dialogues are not boring *at all*. They make up for a good preperation of the grounds for the battle royale!!!",

            "content": "First of all, this is my first review, so I figured I'd do it on my favorite anime. Bear with me. Also, I'll never rate anything a 10. I don't believe it exists.\r\nThe Fate series is based on the general premise of the \"Holy Grail Wars,\" an event in which seven Magi are chosen at random by the Holy Grail, a supernatural ancient artifact, to fight to the death for a chance to have their wish granted. These Magi are accompanied by a Servant; an ancient warrior of history, mythological or real, to fight alongside them in this endeavor. These Servants come from seven classes,each with their own strong points, and a \"Noble Phantasm;\" a trump card to use for an edge. These classes are Archer, Saber, Rider, Lancer, Beserker, Caster, and Assassin.\\n\\n\r\nThe background was necessary for this review. In \"Fate/Zero,\" the main Protagonist is the renowned Mage Slayer, Kiritsugu Emiya (Or Emiya Kiritsugu in Japanese) and his Servant, \"Saber.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is explosive. Although the first episode is slow (It's a 45 minute background), it immediately picks up pace and doesn't leave a dull moment. If you're into high-caliber action, Fate is primarily built on the premise of it. The soundtrack is fast paced, and the action scenes fit the bill perfectly. Each character is given somewhat of a background, some done more well than others, but loose ends are rare. \\n\\n\r\nWatching it through the first time, I personally fell in love with the characters. Some are designed to carry a weight of humor, some you love to hate, and some you just hate. For the sake of spoilers, I won't go too into detail, but you are going to feel emotion while watching this. There are certainly points to feel angry at the world, some to cry about, some to laugh, and some to lose sleep over. \\n\\n\r\nFor someone new to the Fate series, this is certainly the one to start with. Starting with Fate/Stay Night will reveal spoilers from /Zero, as Zero is the first out of the two currently in anime form. If nothing thus far has been a selling point, consider the following as a concluding point of interest:\\n\\n\r\nI never had an interest in manga before the Fate series. Fate opened the way to Manga, Visual Novels, everything beyond a 13 episode series. If you enjoy such a thing, give this series a try.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for your time, hope I was of some help",

            "content": "Fate/Zero in a word: Diverse\r\nI say Diverse because of all the different stories entangled together. Every character has a back story along with the main plot that is pushing forward. It makes it hard to classify this anime. It has intense, gory moments, but I would not classify it as the same kind of anime as something like Another or Death Parade. In addition to the gore it also has really touching moments and lots of action. So I like the variety.\r\nHowever, I do not understand why it is as popular as it is. It isn't bad, but it isn't fantastic either. It's cool, butit doesn't have well constructed plot. The beginning and all the character introductions are pretty good, and some of the twists and turns of the plot are well done too, but when it came time to ties all these loose ends together... it was meh. This is the main reason I like the 1st season better than the 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nI think the anime began to suffer when the main character spotlight shifted from Saber. Then after that, it shifted to a couple other characters, like the author had internal conflict about who's story he was writing. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you are in love with this, Congratulations. I, however, think it isn't worthy of such a huge fan base.",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW WILL REFER TO BOTH SEASONS*\r\nFate/Zero is one of the best anime I have ever watched! It does a brilliant job in each and every aspect and it has so much going on for it that I could recommend it to almost anyone!\r\nThe setting is the same as in it's sequel- Fate/Stay Night; Seven mages (the masters) summon themselves a servant of one out of seven classes. once all are summoned, starts a seven on seven tag team battle royale where the winning pair wins the holy grail, an omnipotent object that can grant any wish to both the master and their servant.\r\nThe conceptis great overall, but the one thing that makes it SO MUCH BETTER then any Fate/Stay Night adaptation is the characters. Unlike the bland, annoying characters from Fate/Stay Night, the characters in Fate/Zero have a lot more depth to them. Each character has a different ideology, different motivations and a different interaction with their partner which make the entire situation much more realistic. All characters are good and relatable and it's really hard to point out a bad guy at times.\\n\r\nThe story is very character driven and no character has any plot armor. It's almost impossible to predict anything in this series, since any character may do anything (including dying) at any given moment and you find yourself sitting tight on your chair not knowing what to expect, mindlessly watching episode after episode.\\n\r\nThe only weaker parts are the beginning and the end. Since this anime also targeted people who didn't watch Fate/Stay Night, the first episode is a 40 minute long boring exposition that feels more like a documentary. But even though the anime also targeted people who didn't watch Fate/Stay Night, it still had to live up to it's pre-existing sequel, resulting in a pretty anticlimactic ending that doesn't make much sense.\\n\r\nNevertheless, I really enjoyed watching it. The characters and story are amazing and as for the slow start and the anticlimactic ending, I can look the other way.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is absolutely beautiful. The quality is nearly cinematic with beautiful character design and special effects. You can see animation of that quality in many other anime, but only in recently released anime and even then, not consistently in each frame like in Fate/Zero.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was composed mostly by Yuki Kajiura. Enough said.\\n\r\nThe music in this show is perfect for it, portraying the overall vibe of the show very well and adding to it, creating a lot of suspense in any given moment, whether it's an epic battle or a simple conversation.\\n\r\nThe voice actors (in both the original Japanese and the English dub, mind you) all did a wonderful job and they all fit their characters very well.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend you watch this anime, because I believe that anyone can find something to like about it. The beginning might be slow and the ending might be weird, but these are just two episodes and this anime is too good to ignore because of them.",

Some you might even grow to love, And some you might cry for. With that said the story is about the \"holy grail war\" Which picks heroes asservants to fight each other in a battle to decide who is deserving of the grail amazing wish granting device.

I must give credit to the high quality artwork, voicing, and animation- It looked beautiful. Beserker, archer's flying throne thingy and the blood overflowing from the grail however, simply did not fit the rest of the anime in their style. (mostly likely different rendering technique?)\r\nThe story was pretty basic. In hindsight it was probably just there to justify the blood. However, The host of unique characters with extended, mysterious, or shrouded backgroundsand their interactions largely made up for this. Though I would not say that the characters were realistic, they certainly were colourful and came from different extremities of the personality spectrum. However the main plot itself was very straight forward, with a few rather unimpressive twists. \\n\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura is a very skilled composer who continues to impress us with her contributions to this series. They really transferred the energy of the fights, and indeed the G-force felt by the characters to the viewer. Which is the other highlight of this series- the fights. The animation and sound quality of the anime does not falter and has created some of the most impressive fighting scenes I have seen in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe Fate/Zero series is a very high quality one with a fair amount of blood, violence, darkness, and plenty of colourful characters. But one whose overarching story lacks depth and twists.",

This one was entertaining and the fight scenes were a lot of fun to see epic heroes from the past pitted against one another!  Alas where this anime lost me is the whole concept of \"magi\" summoning reincarnated heroes to fight for the Holy Grail which happens to grant the winner any wish.\r\nNow what lost me here is \"Why these magi get to participate?\"  \"Is it an exclusive club?\"  \"Is it only ifthe magi is aware of the Holy Grail War about to happen?\"  Then they spend money/resources to acquire some \"relic\" that has something to do with who the magi's champion will be.  IDK, maybe I wasn't paying enough attention but this anime left me with a lot of questions throughout the story.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd what's with the pedophile worms that grant powers?  Like, wtf??",

            "content": "In first season, or first half, I found genre really off putting. I was here for Urobuchi, but what I got was a lot of excuses to throw flashy fights, kinda reason why I dropped Fate/Stay Night, except this really is way way better in every way. Even flashy fights were amazing, but I found their context and consequence really annoying. I guess I was hoping it would tackle the Free For All conundrum in a new and interesting way, kind of like Mirai Nikki at least tried. But Fate/Zero wasn't really interested in that, in first season it really looks as classical overuse offights to death consistently ending with excuse to off put the fight for later. Excuses felt a bit dishonest, as if only here because plot demanded it. And plot does demand it, plot goes on to expand the character cast and introduce a lot of things, little by little. Well, little by little was my problem with it, there was seemingly too much fighting minus consequences, and too little what I've come to expect from Urobuchi. I had to wait till second half, episode 16 to get to the Urobuchi goodness. \\n\\n\r\nIt's then, in second season, or second half, that characters and world views start to get explored in detail. Where shit starts going down. When stuff starts mattering. Like it genre shifted from shounen into psychological thriller. There are some goodies in first half, as well as some baddies in second half, naturally. It's part of what's keeping this from being a masterpiece in my book. Another part of it, now... Hulk would smash me for this, but another part is plot logic. The fantasy magic setting just felt overused as a cop out sometimes, where you aren't supposed to question stuff really. I just can't respect that as much as plot that pulls everything off with super solid logic. Maybe it's just my aversion towards magic in serious works. And this is very very serious work.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the plot logic feels clunky at places, storytelling wise, second half really does tell a very compelling story, that left me staring at credits screen at the end just being overall impressed. Though part of it was not being sure what exactly went on, and/or pondering how I should feel about what went on. I disliked the brutality, it was his most brutal work I've seen yet. Some of those scenes... just NO... just fuck you no! I'm also slightly annoyed that one plot thread never got explored, even though it's not exactly a plot hole as possibility of exploring the thread died together with the character. I was at first very impressed anime decided to tackle the thematic, just to see it completely ignored later. I guess its point was only to further characterize one of the characters, but even so, it's somewhat unforgivable to me as I really looked forward to see how it would be handled. It goes without saying how deep and nuanced characters are, along with their philosophies that get examined really nicely, though there is little of it in the first half. Funnily enough, second half/season also has far superior OP/ED, though mostly music wise.\\n\\n\r\nUfotable is the studio behind the production. It means production quality is ''holy shit how much did this cost?''. Ufotable visuals will surely help you get through the first half, definitely helped me.",

            "content": "Every so often there comes along a show that exceeds anything ever dreamed of within the anime community. While there had been previous ones, in 2011, that show was Fate/Zero. Often praised for its breathtaking art, done by studio Ufotable, Fate/Zero is a series of more than just looks; it stands strong in story and characters as well. While this show may not be for everyone--it can be difficult to understand for those who are new to the Fate franchise, and its themes may be too dark for some--I am of the belief that this show is an absolute must-watch for any and all withinthe anime community.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9/10\\n\r\nPerhaps the weakest section of the series, though still not even close to bad, is Fate/Zero's overall story. The concept of a battle royale is not unique by any means, and one could easily dismiss the Holy Grail War as a cheap plot device to be the catalyst for action and battle scenes. However, Fate/Zero, while being within the action genre, is not an action story. When two characters clash, it is not about who can spill the most blood--it is about a clash of ideals. When two characters fight, it is a contest to see who is more determined to fight for their ideal, of which can only be achieved by crushing the dreams of others. One thing I really like about Fate/Zero is the fact that there really is no main character--at least not to the extent of Ufotable's other work, Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works. Because of this, each character's dreams and reasons for fighting is revealed to the viewer, which, as the viewer grows attached to these characters, makes the tragedy--as most of these characters inevitably die--that much more impactful. Also, Fate/Zero is not the typical battle royale; it puts its own twist on that idea, with the summoning of Heroic Spirits from history or mythology to fight as Servants. If you have any interest in prominent mythological or historical figures, I could not recommend this series enough.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\r\nNow on to what is, in my opinion, the best section of the series, the characters. For a story brimming with so many characters, Fate/Zero manages them extremely well. Most of the characters have interesting character designs, as well as intriguing backstories and motivations. However, there are a few UBW Riders (by this, I mean underdeveloped) in the story as well, so this section is not perfect. But for even these underdeveloped characters, their pairing with their Heroic Spirit could not have been better. Each Master seems to have been partnered with a Servant who happens to contrast and challenge their character in absolutely brilliant ways. You have Waver and Rider, a weak, often wimpy teenage boy forced to work together with the proud, large, and loud Alexander the Great. You have Saber and Kiritsugu, the knight who fights with honor and pride paired with the assassin who has no problem using dirty means to accomplish his work. Nearly every duo is like this, and the way that their contradicting personalities help the other to grow and develop is a beautiful thing to see.\\n\\n\r\nART/SOUND: 9.5/10\\n\r\nI'm sure there is nothing I can say about the art that has not been said before. It is a masterpiece, likely having the best animation in any TV series possibly excluding UBW, especially considering that this was a TV series made in 2011 by a studio that likely had less than a movie budget. Moving on to sound; with a soundtrack composed by Yuki Kajiura, who did an absolutely FANTASTIC job in the Kara no Kyoukai movie series, as well as Madoka Magica, anyone should have expected Fate/Zero to give you an eargasm. And while the soundtrack for Fate/Zero is still very good, with many amazing pieces, I could not help but feel that it was lacking just a little bit. It is of my opinion that music should do more than complement a scene; it should almost make the scene. And in the Fate/Zero action scenes, while music is present, it is often quite subdued, sometimes so quiet that one has to consciously listen for it in order to hear it. In addition, there are many scenes that have no music at all. Despite my critical judgement, it is rather nitpicky, as the soundtrack for this series is still among the best I have ever heard. Both of the openings and endings for this series are among my favorites, with their catchy beats and stunning visuals, and with each of them portraying a certain mood masterfully well.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nWhile I may have sounded overly harsh in some of my analysis, please do not get me wrong, as this series is a masterpiece and I enjoyed it as such. There were a few slow points, but the plot did not take long to pick up again. I have rewatched the series four times now, and each time, despite me watching it with an increasingly critical eye, I came out of it loving the series just as much, if not more, as I noticed more and more small details, some of which play out later in Stay Night. In all honestly, I disliked this series the most during my first watch; for whatever reason, I was determined to not like it, likely because I wanted to defend UBW as being my favorite. Overall, to me, this series is very high up on my favorites list, and, in all its generic glory: holds a special place in my heart.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\r\nI understand that this series may not be for everyone, and there are many who will not enjoy it nearly as much as I have. For the faint-hearted, I would not recommend this series, as there are occasional instances of rape and murder. But for any who are looking for a dark, mature series, which does not take place in a high school setting; does not have fanservice (-cough- Gil aside); is not overrun by teenagers (most characters are actually adults, which is a breath of fresh air); interesting and intriguing characters; and proposes a unique and powerful twist on the battle royale plot, this series should skyrocket to the top of your plan to watch list. At the very least, it is an entertaining watch with its beautiful visuals and engaging plot. I should be very surprised if you are disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nNote: this is a review for the series as a whole, and not just season one.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Quick review.\r\nFate Zero is a fantastic original story that really pulls you into the depth of what one would sacrifice to be a Master for the sake of the Holy Grail War and the cost to one's soul and far one would go...and ultimately ask the question, was it really worth it?\r\nI always admired the art for the Fate/Stay series but the story felt so convoluted that I couldn't stay interested.  It may be because of the fact it's based on a PC game with multiple arcs and possibilities, but the OVAs and preceding shows feels to me that it doesn't want to committo one storyline and backstory for Emiya Shirou and gang.  Fate Zero does an amazing job of really getting the viewer intrigued by the characters; you know Kiritsugu is not a good guy because of what he does, but as a protagonist, you want to be connected to him and though it takes a chunk of the series to understand why, when you get to that part of the journey it really hits the emotional chord and makes the viewer able to sympathize with him.  And since the show assumes you know Saber, it doesn't waste too much time delving into her character or revolving the show around her, rather it spends more time with the other Masters.  By the end of the show, you really understand most of the major masters and servants and the show asks you to emotionally invest in each one.\\n\r\nThe only really glaring flaw for this show is the dragging pace it starts off with.  It doesn't pick up until a couple episodes in and it could've taken more effort to draw in the audience with a gripping first two episodes rather than using exposition to set up the story and slow moving scenes.\\n\r\nI would highly recommend this show even, especially if you haven't seen the Fate/Stay series (or don't even plan on watching it).  It's a great standalone show though with not a lot of feel-good moments.  Yet it sets up an intriguing story with beautiful art and backdrops that doesn't rely on many gimmicks or merchandising.",

Additionally, this is the first anime in the Fate series that I have seen, so I also had to learn about the concept of the overall series. But, at least for this anime, patience is key and certainly rewarding.\r\nNearly everything in this anime is perfect: the storyline, the art, the fight scenes, and especially the CHARACTERS. Let me say thisas a testament to the quality of Fate/Zero - I have watched some long anime (Naruto, Bleach, Hunter x Hunter), and the way I was drawn to Iskander (Rider) and Arthur (Saber) and their philosophical struggles of kingship was unprecedentedly quick. Other anime tackle concepts of friendship and family, but this anime delves deep into the philosophy of leadership and utilitarianism. \\n\\n\r\nSince I have not seen any of the other Fate series, I cannot say if you should watch this one first or not. I do know that this one takes place before the others (and it is on Netflix), which is why I watched it first. However, this anime has been an incredible experience - on par with Deathnote for me. Just be sure to watch this after having a basic understanding of philosophy - it will make the experience that much more enjoyable.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero pits historical heroes and their contemporary human partners against each other in a slow-burning battle for the holy grail.\r\nThis anime focuses on the different motivations for ambition, how rulers see the world around them, and the personal relationships between legends and their partners. Although the series has philosophical undertones, there are several fight scenes between the opposing teams. The anime falls somewhere between anime for college students and anime geared towards teenagers.\r\nThe first season introduces the characters, and the second season develops the two primary antagonists. I group both seasons together in this review. Although this anime is part of a larger universe, youdo not need to be familiar with other Fate works to enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOne strength of the show is the way in which the anime develops the historical legends. The author takes characters that are well known---such as Alexander the Great and King Arthur---and introduces something new to their characters so that they move beyond their traditional depictions. The series also touches on gender roles / gender fluidity, and has an interesting philosophical conflict between utilitarianism and individualism. I recommend looking up the backstory for Gilles de Rais if you are unfamiliar (as I was), it's totally wild. The production and art quality is high.\\n\\n\r\nMy concerns with this show revolve around the pacing. I thought that the first season was unnecessarily slow, and---in my opinion---the ending to the second season became very rushed. Some episodes focused on side stories that were not important for the central plot. I wonder if the narrative could have been improved by having fewer teams fighting for the grail, or fewer overall characters within the show.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to viewers who are interested in philosophical themes, historically inspired characters, and strong inter-character relationships. If you are looking for a more faced-paced story, or are not interested in fight scenes, try elsewhere.",

Fate/Zero is THE most visually amazing anime out there, period, it has an amazing cast of characters that doesn\u2019t really focus on a \u201cprotagonist\u201d. With an amazing OST and deep plot that doesn\u2019t give you the usual we gotta beat the bad guy. I honestly don\u2019t have anything to complain about some say the ending isn\u2019t great but I kinda disagree. If you want a story how stories are supposed to be told and not dumbed down like you\u2019re a child then you should, ordare I say have to watch this anime. This show is so amazing that I actually idolize one of the characters and take their views about the word to heart, that is how impactful this show is.  \\n",

I mean your hardly going to watch just the one any way. \r\nThe bad\r\nThe first episode of the anime is pretty slow especially if you've seen fate Stay night. The ending isn't really an end in it's own right as this is a prequel. Bezerker's master doesn't really jump out at me, he's not bad per say just not up to this anime's standards. \r\nThe good\r\nEasily the best part of this anime arethe characters, theirs lots of them and almost all of them get the time they deserve. Just sitting a few of these characters in a room and having them talk about their conflicting Ideologies sounds real boring but the characters are lovable enough that I don't mind(they do have plenty of trying to kill each other too so don't worry about it). Even the most repulsive of them are either likeable, interesting or a bit of both. The highlights for me are rider who simply feels larger then life even when he's a super tall anime character, and the MC. Kiritsugu is also quite interesting, his goal is world peace this is something he doesn't stray from this goal he never stops trying to do the right thing, but the thing is their's really not a single thing he's unwilling to do if it's for the greater good. Unlike other anime were they just tell us that the main character is ruthless and jaded but they end up being morally upstanding individuals, he is brutal as f*** more so then most of his rivals even, which adds an interesting level of moral ambiguity to the situation. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are both top notch this has some of the best fights I have seen in anime, which are creative, smart and flashy. The animation is also pretty excellent.",

You get a lot of info and background on the characters, the rules of the \"game\" their motives. \r\nThe art is astounding, really well made and the computer CGI is well integrated with the rest of the drawing. Movement during battles is nicely done. Where they really exaggerated I think is with Irrisviel's eyes, really huge even for anime standards, sometimes she looks like an alien. Saber's eyes although big as well, they look nice and expressive. Detailing is nicely done, thelight during sunsets is amazing, Ufotable is good at that, many of their shows have that.\\n\\n\r\nSound is good, music is nice during the battle scenes and very fitting. Watched in the Japanese dub, English voice over is not bad, helps you understand better some of the dialogue heavy scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely a show to watch, but the show has a season 2 and it's meant to be watched together. This season sets the stage for season 2!",

            "content": "WATCH IF: You are into dark, character-driven anime that deals with a lot of mature themes. Also, if you are into sadness, and you just want to feel pain.\r\nDON'T WATCH IF: You are just looking for something lighthearted, or if you are in the mood for something more action-based or less dialogue-heavy.\r\n---\r\nWow. What a masterpiece. For my first review on this site, I wanted it to be Fate/Zero because I just love it so much.\r\nI will be honest. I watched this without any expectations. I had seen Fate/Stay Night just a few nights past, and while I liked it fair enough, it wasn't the kindof anime that I would be willing to watch again. In two words: pretty forgettable. Still, the premise of the show was fascinating enough that I figured, 'ah, hell, might as well watch the other one.'\\n\\n\r\nThe premise for both series is pretty similar. Imagine if you played Celebrity Deathmatch against seven other people, except instead of Justin Timberlake or BritBrit, you got legendary heroes from history and/or folklore. Sounds like an OP heroes crossover wet dream of sorts, which is pretty much why I kept watching even if I didn't like Fate/Stay Night all that much.\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, oh boy. Look, if you didn't like F/SN, or if you are planning on watching F/SN or UBW, just watch this first. Seriously. It's the best one, and it's the one you can't miss. It's complex, adult, different. It hit the mark in pretty much every aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nMain premise is simple enough. Honestly, any 10-year-old with a half-decent imagination (and some really cool action figures) must have conjured up such a storyline at one point in their lives. But that isn't why it's so good. The series takes a simple premise and adds in all these little details and nuances to make it seem more real. \\n\\n\r\nIt delves into themes that are very mature and very dark. For example, the show actually critiques the kind of radical romanticism that is held by the main character in a lot shonen shows. At the same time, it isn't so cynical; it also goes on to critique absolute pragmatism. Barring some episodes that dwelled too much on telling (dialogue) rather than showing, the writing in this series is absolutely top notch.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, it has tons of subplots that develop the characters but at the same time drive the story forward. To do one thing is a feat, but to do both at the same time just takes talent. Pacing is fast enough to keep you on the edge of your seat (although admittedly Season 2 does this better than Season 1), but at the same time it isn't fast enough to keep you from getting attached to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nI love that they threw in some CGI there. It makes for a very stylish and unique-looking anime. It isn't quite as good as UBW, but hell, I think it's still very good and all the action sequences are very much well-animated.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nOST is great. It doesn't stand out, I don't think, not in the way that it stands out because it's so revolutionary. It's standard action-type music - you get some rock-ish and/or operatic vibes. It is effective, though, so I will give them that.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nThe storytelling is top-notch, but it is the characterisations in this series that really pulls you in. You have a diverse set of characters with different motivations and different viewpoints. This is crucial in a show that's pretty much just about 7 people against each other. One moment, you find yourself rooting for someone; the next, you find them yourself hating them to bits. Everyone has a dark or selfish side, but everyone shows signs of redemption as well. It really makes you feel like war is breaking out - because no one is absolute right; everyone is just stuck in a really shitty situation.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the individual characters themselves, the dynamics between Masters (think of the player controlling the celebrity in our hypothetical celebrity death match) and Servants (the celebrities) are very well-thought out and meaningful. Kiritsugu and his servant, despite having similar end goals, possess ideologies on polar ends of the spectrum; a contrast is also shown between the immature/insecure Waver and his easygoing but confident servant. Other dynamics are forged to create meaningful subplots that reveal a lot about humanity.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\\n\r\nI can go on and on, because I really love this anime so much. I won't be completely biased. There are parts when they just drone on with the dialogue. The first episode in particular, despite having an epic ending, was a massive info dump. However, the strengths of this series completely outshine the very few weaknesses. Don't miss out on this show. It's a classic.",

The first hindrance to this show is the incredibly boring info dump that happens in episode 1. 45 minutes of boring dialogue makes it hard for anyone to get into this series. The other problem that hinders both season 1 and 2 is the fact that it is tied to Fate/Stay Night, which is pretty bad (at least, the anime and movie are). Now that we gotall the bad out of the way, lets talk about the good. The Fate series as a whole is very original in the fact that it takes heroes from across time and has them fight to the death for the chance to make one wish. The best part is that it is done during the present day, making the setting here pretty special. Some things might fly over your head if you aren't the best at history, especially since many of these guys are lesser known people. The pacing isn't that good. For an action series there is not much action in the first half. It really is just a bunch of characters trying to outsmart each other while talking a lot about a specific topic at hand. There is a lot of buildup in season 1, as season 2 is when the real party starts.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 30/35 - I really like the characters in this show. No two characters are the same, and each one has their own ideologies and reasons for being in the war. Hearing what they have to say on the different topics at hand all while fighting can be very cool. The topics range from chivalry to what it means to be a king and a hero. The most notable characters in this series are easily Rider, who commands everyone's attention once he hits the stage to Gilgamesh, who is just badass. While not every character is particularly interesting, none of them are bad or all that boring. Considering the huge cast of characters, I'd say this is pretty impressive. I will say this though, the pasts for some of the servants should be expanded upon more, like for Assassin. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 14/15 - The sound in this series is amazing, mostly because of the amazing composer behind it. The opening and endings aren't the best, but the epic chorus' during each fight make every interaction between the characters all the more intense. \\n\r\nI have heard a little bit of the dub, and I find it acceptable. Although if you don't mind reading subtitles I suggest you watch it subbed. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 15/15 - The best I have ever seen in an anime that isn't a movie. Fluid, great looking, and some very detailed backgrounds. You can't ask for more in this regard. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 86/100 - A very good series, especially since this is only the buildup to something better. The characters and setting really shine in this show, and the story is no slouch either. Fate/Zero could have used some better pacing and more fighting. I like hearing all these philosophies as much as the next guy, but I wanna see some fighting too.",

Fate Zero is the prequel to fate stay night, and its an enjoyable watch all around.\r\nFate stay night revolved heavily around the flaws of the characters, the cast, and the setting. Fate Zero is basically fate stay night if everyone was scarily competent. we see everyone in the war (with one exception) to know exactly whats going on and with full blown well though out plans in this war. There is definitely a lot less running around or questioning, and most servants are named right away.",

The characters is themost memorable of all time except for Caster who freaked the living hell out of me when i first know who he was god i wanted him dead so bad i dont know why i feel weird but the enjoyment is gonna hype alot to story and characters and alot of stuff your gonna love this anime and pumped for the next season!",

I think Fate/Stay Night is too cheesy for me but fate/zero was like the adult version. Its like a more realistic atmosphere with the bad guys actually acting like bad guys which you don't see a lot nowadays. it's not just action/fantasy, it has a deep/psychological story to it and kept me guessing up til the end. It's not for the light-hearted either in some aspects. I can't describe this anime in words so just watch itand ENJOY!!!",

            "content": "Fate/Zero is one of few anime that I feel pushes the boundaries of anime without feeling like it isn't anime.  What I mean by this is that if most of your entertainment comes from anime this will feel very at home to you but if you say watch some other shows that generally have differing structures to most anime this will be a perfect medium.  I see this show very often be described as similar to Game of Thrones and while I see where they're coming from with that comparison I prefer to designate this as anime's (more specifically ufotable's) answer to Gameof Thrones.  What I mean by this is while similar to Game of Thrones it has a general lack of plot armor and a more mature storyline (not nearly as dark as Game of Thrones) it still is similar to anime with its setting in Japan and of course the fact that it is animated by a Japanese production studio.  With that out of the way I like to talk more about the show itself instead of its general structure and reception and I'll try my best to avoid spoilers but there will be a general plot summary coming up in the next sentence.  So every few years a Holy Grail War is held in Fuyuki City where in 7 mages of very backgrounds and magical disciplines and their summoned servants who are all famous historical figures which the show brilliantly incorporates, compete to see who will be grant their eternal wish by the grail.  Even though this is a pretty unoriginal and overrall standard basis for a plot the execution of the characters is what elevates this above the some of its part (by which I mean Fate/stay night which I have also watch and mildly recommend).  Without going into spoilers each master and servant have different dynamics between each other, the other servants, and the other masters this raises the show above just a battle royale to a debate of ideals.  For two examples just in the first season two of the stand out characters of the first season in my eyes are caster and his master Rynnosuke who are basically best buds the minute they meet.  But while that was just a master and servant pairing the sheer verbal spouts between competing teams are at a wealth while not being too wordy (if you generally read subs slow I recommend watching this dubbed because its good and is easier to follow).  My favorite example is early on when Saber, Archer, and Rider just sitting down and having a drink to discuss ideals instead of fighting.  This is not to say that the actions aren't good they're fantastic while not quite up to par with say Kara no Kyuokai a movie series by the same company it is above almost all its contemporaries as a 26 episode anime.  If you look at how I rated the categories I gave only two categories below a 10 story and sound this is because the story is great it not everyone can sit through tons of text or people just talking at you and as far as sound it was bad just nothing really stood out to me but that might just be my taste in music and soundtracks.  So overall watch this if you want to be wowed in more ways than one and if you already seen this I suggest Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex because of its similar focus on talking about a lot of broad concepts though I will it admit after watching a few episodes of the action didn't wow me so it comes as a recommendation for people who like the story of Fate/Zero.  Now if you liked the action honestly just watch more ufotable while I never watched any of them in their entirety the animation in the Kara no Kyuokai franchise is incredible and Fate/stay night unlimited blade works has animation better than Zero in a lot of places.",

            "content": "This review applies for both seasons of Fate/Zero and it is my only experience of the Fate universe, so I will review it from the perspective of a standalone anime, with no universe tie in. I assume that there's a lot of things that were done to show tie ins and could be interesting for Fate fans and the people that have knowledge of the universe and they will have a different appreciation of this. Just know that this series sets the events of its sequel in motion and I think, and this is definitely not a guarantee, merely a suspicion so you might wantto consult someone other than me, that you might want to start off with one of its sequels and then watch this to fill in the gaps if you deemed those any good.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the first season of Zero and the second season of Zero are not in any way independent and they pretty much feel like they shouldn't be considered separate seasons by any means. Hence expect when picking up Zero to go on a journey of 26 episodes rather than merely 13.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, let me actually talk about what happens in Fate. So Fate is a story where an omnipotent wish granting device picks seven participants which it arms with spirits which they have to make kill each other. It is not demanded for the people who control the spirits to kill each other because the control will just be sent to a different person but the master provides them with a form and whatnot. Basically, you have a story where people have to kill each other. So in other words, it's a death game. So my problem with Fate is... that pretty much nothing to further this death game happens. More often than not the characters will find a reason to retreat and not commit to the events happening around them or create some reason to approach things in a different way than the most efficient way and what not. And you will be mostly left with one question most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nWhy? \\n\\n\r\nWhy would an omnipotent wish granting device just... not be taken more seriously? Why are the heroic spirits so free to do whatever the fuck they want? And why does everyone approach the war the way they do? Most of these questions will be answered or at least have some rational explanation you can fill in... in the second half of the season. The first half of the series is basically like a game of Monopoly where every player is in jail. You're  constantly rolling the dice but not advancing by any means. And I gotta say, it's pretty annoying. Zero basically stacks up a couple of things and then keeps stacking them up, changes their order a bit and only in the second season, uses anything its build up and somewhat ties it together.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are things that are questionable in the logic of the events and the characters, I'll try to be vague as to not spoil you but let me present you some situations. Say you have something that goes through your defense and you're fighting someone that is famous for fighting people mastering the type of defensive technique you own. How do you choose to proceed in your fight? A) Tighten your defense. B) Find some way to dodge the attack in the future. OR another thing, you know magic is a thing right. In order to ensure you kill someone, what do you do? A) Stab them and leave them to bleed out. B) Kill them on the spot so nothing can regenerate them through magic? OR another thing, lets say again, you know magic is a thing. You see someone being able to travel at fast speeds but not through their usual means. What do you assume? A) It's totally that guy. B) It's probably some shapeshift. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can honestly go on and on like this. There's so many situations in Zero that are like this that are ridiculous. Thus most fights in the series are either: completely one sided with you knowing the victor from the start because, really? OR Wait why would you do that? Like Zero has nice visuals, but the fights only excel in their looks rather than their content. There were only two fights in the series that I could find entertaining, everything else was just boring. Add the contrived logic for an entire season of rolling dice and nothing happening and then a lot of unsatisfaction ensued. \\n\\n\r\nBut to be honest, things become far more understandable and pick up in action in the second season. There are some things that happen by the end that make you realize that the things happening are... different than your expectations of them. What presents itself as a death game, is not a death game. I could explain what it is as vaguely as possible so if you want to have a vague explanation of what it is, read ahead. If not skip the paragraph. I assume since you continued reading you're commited to this paragraph then, okay. The events of Fate are basically a ritual. I won't say what its goal is but  certain conditions need to be met in order for something to happen. That's why everyone pretty much can do whatever they want in whichever way they want. Because things aren't really under anyone's control. As I've said, it's gonna be vague. But knowing this would've made me enjoy this for what it is more so there you go.\\n\\n\r\nNow let me talk about the characters. You will understand their motivations and their desires and this is what the anime tackles. The desire and the actions you're willing to take to fulfill said desire. Anyway, since I've described how some of these actions unravel... some turn offs will obviously happen. And considering most of the character archetypes I didn't like, (for the spirits mostly. Isn't limited to just them but yeah) I can say I didn't really like most. But most characters, the important ones anyway, are defined well. You will know who they are and you will dislike them for who they are or like them for who they are. There is only one character that does feel complete and that is Kiritsugu. In Kiritsugu's case you explore his life and desire fully, having even 2 episodes dedicated to his backstory and you will understand what the character does and how he works by the end of the series rather well. I like his character and how he developed. And I liked some other characters and felt they had good focus on but Kiritsugu kinda steals the show which is fair.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as visuals and sound goes, Fate looks good and sounds good, I liked the voice acting of the series and the overall OST is decently chosen and even has a noteworthy song from it which was pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nBasically Fate ends up as a series about desire. And the consequence and sacrifice to fulfill it. And understand it. And so on and so forth. And it does justice to what it tries to do. Things won't be obvious at first and the series has plenty of flaws but depending on your expectations and prior knowledge the series, the way this show will be received by you I think will be different. I recommend having some knowledge about the things happening prior like what I said about it not actually being a death game. It suffers of not making its message obvious and I assume this is due to focus on the details around the past of the Fate series. You should watch this if you think you like the theme of deaing with desire or have any knowledge of the series as far as its universe goes. But otherwise I recommend avoiding it. It isn't bad as far as it actually succeeds doing goes but... its bad in building up to it. Which I assume is a result of you not knowing exactly what to expect prior.",

            "content": "Fate Zero was a show that I felt improved on the original Fate formula. It being a prequel, it cut straight into the chase with only a brief recap on what the series is about. This I felt to be something that benefited the series more, even though something like UBW's longer intro helped me as a newcomer to the Fate series.\r\nStory: Fate Zero starts out with a colourful cast of characters, and when I mean colourful, I mean that there are like 6 true main characters. I'll get to them in the character section, so I'll move on now. Those familiar with UBW wouldknow that there were only 2 main characters, Emiya and Rin, and that made the stories a bit more centralized and at one moment due to how the story was structured, and how they stuck together. Here, we have a bunch of main characters all lined up for their struggles and wishes to be highlighted. Instead of one area, we are given a basic bird's eye view of Fuyuki due to how everyone's spaced out instead of allied. Even when there is an alliance, it isn't that long. For the overall plot, it's your basic tactical kind of story. Everyone's there to fight for one thing, but what's the highlight of the story is not in the form of the main plot points, but the juicy details in between. The interactions and knowing who helped in what battle ultimately is what sets the standard in this show, and I felt that it did this extremely well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Being a ufotable show, you can already expect what kind of art you'll get yourself into here. Visuals are stunning, although a bit behind UBW due to the latter being 3 years after this. Besides that, minor details are stressed in this show. You can find scenes where small effects are what change a scene from just being there to having an impact. What I also liked was the character designs. Every character is distinctly different, and their designs really reflect who they are. There's no fanservice with anyone, really, and nothing is exaggerated or overdone. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Fate Zero provides us with basically the same standards that I put on my UBW review. Read that for more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I feel like this is where Zero goes slightly astray, but in more of a technical standpoint rather than a developmental one. You see, with all the main characters they have, they aren't as developed since you'd have to spend the same amount of time to develop each and every one of them. Now, none of them aren't really what I'd consider to be hateable, but some I could see why you'd dislike them. For example, Waver. He comes off as a slightly bratty kid whose only goal is to improve his magic. Now, after you do some reading and try to get through the show, you would find that his first impression is a bit true, but also not. I hoped that he would have blown me out of the water by being someone else, but it appears that only applies to UBW. Anyways, I only found Waver to be a bit annoying in terms of personality, and not his overall development. Although limited in development (with his one little intro), you get everything you need to know about him. The only problem with the other masters is that sometimes you don't get enough. I understand why everyone wants to fight in this war, but I don't feel like rooting for anyone in particular due to the lack of knowledge. In UBW, even if Shirou came off as a little annoying, I could find a reason to root for him since I knew everything there was to him. Overall, they were better here on the personalities, but not as much on backstories.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Zero was a trip for me. Half the time, I couldn't even feel that 23 minutes had past, and instead felt that it was more like 10. It made me feel the same urge to binge like UBW season 2, which gives it huge props in terms of enjoyability. Although characters were slightly lacking due to how many there were, everything seemed to be great. I really should have watched this first if we're going to compare it with UBW, but that's just the way I watched it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: You probably could tell, but like most things I review, I found this to be satisfying. Everything was structured nicely, and there was enough that I could view this both with a critical view and also a regular anime watcher view and still give it a pretty good score. If you haven't seen the Fate series, I'd probably recommend UBW first (this kind of spoils a bit in there), then this. But if you're feeling like watching this first, then it's your choice. Anyways, I'd recommend this.\\n",

            "content": "*Covers the entire 25 episode series*\r\nEver wondered how interesting it would be if historical figures from long past times fought against each other? And wouldn't it be interesting if said figures were fueled by magic power, used the symbolism they are related with to fight each other and were categorized under a RPG game class, serving their master mage? The Fate franchise is as close as you'll ever get to that kind of premise. In this case, the Fate/Zero anime, the prequel to the Fate/StayNight anime which is adapted from a novel of the same name written by Gen Urobuchi, is what I will reviewabout.\\n\\n\r\nAs of today, this is the first ever Fate franchise anime I watched so I won't even be able to compare this with FSN(2006) or UBW. I'll talk about it as a standalone anime of 25 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole premise can be easily resumed as being a death tournament where seven mages, chosen by the divine entity of the Holy Grail, summon one powerful spirit of a historical figure of the past each, as their servants, in order for them to fight each other to death. The winner will have his wish granted by the Holy Grail.\\n\\n\r\nThis is something we already have in anime; It is not atypical for anime to have some kind of tournament between powerful fighters at some point as in every typical fighting shounen. I'm not implying it is a shonen, which is not true, but the premise doesn't make it that far from one. \\n\\n\r\nWhat is the Grail? Why are the characters demanded to fight in a tournament? Don\u2019t ask me! Even the anime doesn\u2019t know. Why do they use servants? To avoid bloodshed between masters.\\n\\n\r\nEven though Fate/Zero follows the overblown premise, it actually tries to implement some complex terminology to distinguish itself from the others.\\n\r\nHowever, Fate/Zero fails in attempting to distinguish itself from the rest by introducing these complex rules since the writers will break the rules in the show whenever they feel free and see fit for the plot. Sometimes they even use it to put characters in complete tragedy. These plot conveniences and asspulls are what really made half of the show become a dreadful watch for me and I would rather watch a honest all out battle tournament to this failed attempt in masking what turned out to be just a death match tournament.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing that completely pisses me off about this show is how pretentious it can become at times. When one has the goal to explore any type of theme in a fictional story, making characters to quote some philosophical statements and facing that as actually making the show thematically deep is wrong. You don\u2019t make a show explore a theme by spouting some deep words to the audience and taking that as seriously exploring an idea. \\n\\n\r\nOne laughable situation is that, while the anime is trying to make a point out of morality, it chooses a freaking psychopath to enter the game and make him defend a bloodlusting ideal. What in hell are you trying to imply by putting an inhuman character, in your story, while you're trying to make a point out of what's morally just? A character coming from an historical era where it is excused for him to be bloodlusted is acceptable, but choosing an unrealistic psychopath from modern times? Why? Some say is is to show that the Graal makes wrong decisions while rushing the selection but such a counter argument would only be ok if the anime itself wasn't trying to be smarter than it actually is. If they still wanted to make an intriguing debate out of that situation, the writers should have chosen a completely different character, who disagrees with the manic from old. By having an oposition, there could have been an interesting argument.\\n\\n\r\nSubtlety is a golden rule that must be respected so you wont end up being pretentious as this show. You show characters facing a problem or situation that will transmit the message to the audience, while taking it in a natural way. It really is funny how some people accuse shows like Ergo Proxy and Neon Genesis as being pretentious when these people love Fate/Zero. Even though both series sometimes have their characters uttering thought provoking statements, they still explore those statement in a subtle way by putting their characters in a situation that will speak to the theme, which is not the case of Fate/Zero.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand I can't accuse FZ of being completely pretentious. It does have its well written moments that I pretty much enjoyed about the show. One of the situation where the show does have some complexity is when characters will be discussing about their own ideals and how they perceive the ideals of others around them. This type of exploration is indeed totally different from having characters spouting some pretentious statements in monologue or unrelated dialogue. This time around characters will actually be discussing with each other about a topic in question, so it will be perceived has normal dialogue between people instead of unrelated quoting, which turned the show into something much more engaging. Even when we had two maniac psychopaths discussing about how God loves to watch death and bloodshed, it was still a better choice than going full pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nI found the pacing in FZ somewhat of stalling. Shortly, it was something deliberately slowed so that we could have more character insight throughout the anime but that could be otherwise resolved in a cour and would not need two seasons. Of course that this is a battle to the death but how much would I care for the death of the characters that I barely know something of. Although stalled purposely, it can easily be excused as, while fighting, characters will resort much more to tactics instead of going all out and as such need proper reply to the opponents attack. It can feel somewhat of forced at times but, in the great spectrum of things, it wasn't that poorly thought.\\n\\n\r\nThe finale of the series was a complete let down. It was anti climactic and left me thinking that even a guy like Waver, who had the most childish dream, even if this is changed throughout the series, would have been a much deserving winner instead of how it turned out to be. In order to have such an ending happening it was needed to change the main conviction of a character overnight, which felt unconvincing and cheap since that character had that dream for such a long time that it would be dumb for him not to have acknowledged its consequences a long time ago. \\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSo, even though the story ended up being unpleasant, at least the characters should be able to lift it up a little, right? Well not that much. The writers didn\u2019t worry about establishing the historical characters backdrop as they were counting with the already existent information. They don't even have historical accuracy with Saber's name and even change the gender of the character, which could reveal a complete different story from the legend of King Arthur but that is never shown. We could say that we can predict how it turned out by examining her ideology but that\u2019s rather unrelated. It could be seen as irrelevant and comprehensible if the characters had more to them but they can easily be reduced to the ideals they represent and to a little share of flaws that won\u2019t be overcome in the long run. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some of them receiving some glimpses of it like Rider and Lancer which was actually well done but the others had poor to any of it. The masters are in the same situation of poor backdrop. Kiritsugu however had his entire back story shown and I felt pleased with the result. The main problem with these characters is that, since they are nothing besides walking ideologies, even though that can bring some features to a character, they rarely feel human at all and whenever they develop a character it will happen in a very messy way. Thanks to that, characters lose their ideology and feel rewritten with an entire different personality with no trace of what they were before. That way, characters feel more like plot devices than actual characters. \\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI may seem like I'm lying but, to be honest, the presentation in FZ is something I don't really enjoy. I can understand how people describe it as beautiful, colorful and vivid but that opinion doesn't seem to be mine. What I most dislike about it are the character figures. In an anime where the creators are trying to sell an image of seriousness, which they should if they wanted to explore mature themes, these fail horribly. They are far too inadequate and simplistic for a story that includes various deaths and bloodshed, mainly the feminine characters. The art just doesn't blend with it. \\n\\n\r\nAnime like HunterxHunter face the same situation but in this case HxH's art is completely able to assimilate its darker moments and transmit the pressure in life or death situations without breaking my immersion.\\n\\n\r\nScenarios are otherwise extremely realistic and detailed, which would be perfect in an anime where the character figures would not be very simplistic and had at least realistic proportions, like in the Mukou Hadan movie, but in FZ sometimes the characters and the background seem so distant in tone that I just can't enjoy it. Not much of a problem as the other one but this one also has his impact. When the image feels alright though it looks outstanding. \\n\\n\r\nVisual effects are top-notch for a TV series and, opposed to the scenarios, the more complex they are, the more eye gripping they look. \\n\r\nArt/Animation: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is extremely well fitting for the series and magnificently well used. The creators know how to place each track so it can extract the most out of each moment whatever it is about. Really makes the action sequences more dynamic and engaging. Most of the easy-going tracks have somewhat of an overblown tune to them but they still nail its effect. Sound effects are also well used and don't have much I can add to them. Something I recommend listening, although I don't count with them to score the sound section, are the openings and the first ending of the series. They are completely top material. Sound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you are going to watch FZ in order to watch some well built and animated fights, you won't be disappointed. If you're going for the discussion of ideals between the so called characters, you will be mildly satisfied. However, if you're going for its self-indulgent philosophical wannabe side, you will regret watching it. Recommendable under certain conditions.\\n\\n",

But getting to see the 4th Grail War and being introduced to new characters rejuvenated my interest in this franchise. \r\nI gotta say, I much prefer the Caster and Rider pairs from the 4th Grail War over the pairs from the 5th Grail War. They're a lot richer as characters than the Caster and Rider pairs from Fate/stay night and UBW. \r\nI'm also enjoying seeing the connections to the 5th Grail War that came aboutbecause of the 4th Grail War. There's a few things with Emiya, for example, that pave the way for Shirou and his part in the Grail Wars that's really cool to see. \\n\\n\r\nThere's also a little more background given for Rin and Sakura, which is interesting because I didn't think I'd see the main series' characters at all in this prequel. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Fate/Zero has been a really positive experience.

So after hearing them talk about I finally decided to start my journey into the Fate anime series with Fate/Zero's first season. And it looks like my journey is starting off great.\r\nThe characters all have distinct and different personalities and its exciting to watch the interactions the different masters and servants have witheach other. They all have their reasons for fighting and that makes it hard to root for your personal favorite when they have to in this war, but when they do its exciting and heartpounding to watch. The animation is great and in the fight scenes is where it really stands out. As the character designs and fight choreography and beautiful display here. For as of now I am watching the english dub of the series and the cast is great, you have some veteran actors doing great performances all around, this is a great dub cast and they are doing an excellent job.\\n\\n\r\nSo with me talking about so much good stuff  about this anime, there is something I do not like about the series, and to me its music. Now don't get me wrong the soundtrack is not bad it fits well with the anime, for when there is the quiet talking scenes between two characters or when the action scenes happen when they supply that bombastic display destruction and tension. It's fine for being in the background and setting the atmosphere but it just doesn't have a track that stands out or is memorable to me personally. \\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is a good entry point, I think for anyone who wants to finally start to get into the Fate series. It's for the fan who loves good drama, fantasy and action in your anime.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero Review (NO SPOILERS)\r\n.......................................................................................WHAT.\r\nOk. Fate/Zero. A show that I saw a lot of pictures of for a while and it just had something about it that made me think it would become one of my favorite anime series ever. Did that end up being true? Well, let's see. Now, before I begin the review, let me make it clear that first off, this is a review of BOTH seasons. Not just 1 or 2. Just so we're clear on that. You can't really just stop at the first season, anyway, so I feel this is justified. And second, this review is being done by someonewho has ZERO (teehee) experience with ANYTHING else Fate, related. I haven't seen Fate/Stay Night, I haven't seen Unlimited Blade Works. I chose to start with Fate/Zero, because it's first in the timeline. So if my opinions seem a bit strange, due to not knowing anything else that happens in the future, that is why. Ok. Now that that's settled, let's jump into the review.\\n\\n\r\nNow, again. This review is being done, before seeing anything else Fate related. Fate/Zero may be first in the timeline, but it was released after Fate/Stay Night and Unlimited Blade Works. So maybe this complaint would be null and void if I watched it in release order, but I really had a hard time following what was going on, a lot of the time. The first season is very slow, in my opinion. It focuses a lot more on building up the world and characters, but in a bit of a weird, almost awkward sort of way. While the second season completely focus on tearing everything apart, and ripping any and all hope you had for anything and anyone to shreds. The second season was much more intense and engaging to watch, but I still wish that kind of intensity was sprinkled all around the entirety of this show, rather than just solely the second half. For the most part, I knew what was going on. I know who's on whose side. I know which characters I'm rooting for. I know what they're fighting for. I get the main gist of it, but it tends to get a bit convoluted in terms of explaining its history. Stuff like the connections and relations with all the characters in the past, explaining the details of the Holy Grail War, the different classes and creatures and rules of magic in this world. It got better in the second season, which is a lot more action oriented. But then it wen back to being confusing in the ending. And I still don't entirely know what just happened.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters either range from very interesting, to not at all. Personally, I much rather preferred watching the servants be on screen and interact with one another, while the master characters were a lot less interesting and overall kinda quiet and bland. It's like, the show knew that they were taking a back seat to the servants, who were the real stars of the show. But still tried to focus the main story elements all on them. The masters have the deep story, while the servants have the fun personalities. If only we could've gotten both traits within both groups. Though, the masters did have their moments. Even if it was usually only when they were interacting with their servants. Specifically Irisveil and Waver. It certainly helped that they had the most interesting servants, out of the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nNow the place where this show REALLY shines, is in its animation. I'll just say it right here. I'm not sure if I'd call Fate/Zero's animation my favorite that I've ever seen. But I'm willing to say that it's one of, if not THE best animation I've ever seen in an anime series, not counting movies. This show is downright gorgeous in every way! Seriously, it looks like it was released just yesterday, it looks so good! I'd go as far as to say that you need to watch this show, only for the amazing visuals. Because it's seriously stellar, 100% of the time. As for the music, I'm pretty much neutral on it. Nothing really jumped out on me, but it certainly wasn't bad, by any means, either. And as for the sub vs dub debate, considering the type of show that this is, with medieval knights and warriors and whatnot, I think it's a bit more appropriate to watch in English. The dub is pretty fantastic, with every single character. The only complaint I could come up with is that Kirei and Kiritsugu had VERY similar voices, and I often got their characters mixed up, because of that. But still, the performances were amazing, nonetheless. Though, I should probably warn you that if you plan on watching the entire Fate series in English, you'll have to watch out for some casting changes. As the main character, Saber, goes through a whopping THREE English voice actors, throughout the series. So if hearing characters lose their voice actors is a turn off for you, then you might wanna stick with the Japanese. The Japanese dub is amazing, as well. And I feel it actually adds to Saber's personality, specifically. Honestly, both the Japanese and English get my complete and total approval. So pick whichever one you like.\\n\\n\r\nSo then.... did I like this show? Well.... there were a couple times where I was heavily considering dropping it. The first season is VERY slow, and while the action parts are fun to watch, it was just very rare to see any of those, on top of the story being rather confusing. If it wasn't for the FIRST episode of Season 2 getting REAL intense REAL quickly, I probably would've dropped this show. Season 2 was much more enjoyable, and incredibly intense and mind blowing until the very end. Speaking of the end...... WHAT!? Like, seriously. WHAT!? Ok. If they were planning to get people like me to immediately want to watch Fate/Stay Night, after Zero, they succeeded. You outright can't just watch Fate/Zero. Not with that ending! I am definitely very much intrigued to find out what happens next, now. For those who watched Fate/Zero after Stay Night and UBW, I'm not sure how you'd feel about this show. Personally, I'm sure I would've appreciated learning about the backstory a bit more, but having THIS be the last Fate thing I ever watch would've been very... weird. So I'm glad I decided to watch Zero first. And while it may not be right away, they definitely sold me on eventually watching the rest of the story unfold.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero gets a 7/10",

            "content": "Considering coming back to this review as soon as I finish Season 2.\r\nFate/Zero Season 1 is difficult to review. Ultimately, it just doesn't deliver what you would hope it to. But since this is only Season 1, that is sort of what you would expect. If I had to rate the first 30 episodes of FMA:B, a show with an action-packed, thrilling conclusion, I would give it a much lower score. In the same way, it is disingenuous to say that, since there isn't much being resolved at this point of the series, that this season doesn't do its job well enough. It could bedoing its job exactly as it needs to, and I just wouldn't be aware of that without completing the series. As such, I'll be giving Fate/Zero S1 the benefit of the doubt... for now.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, it seems like Fate/Zero Season 1 fails to deliver on many promises that are pushed by the premise. You expect a battle royale with thrilling action, strategy, and political moves, and high stakes. The action is mediocre, there is little strategy, political dynamics are hinted at but never come to fruition, and there are no recognizable stakes since nothing really happens.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Rating]\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nArt: 9 \\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 5]\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the show is cool. Battle royales are exciting! But the first season does not execute on it well enough.\\n\\n\r\nNothing happens. There is essentially no change to the landscape of the Holy Grail War since the reveal of all the Masters/Servants. This is a huge problem. If there are no stakes, there's no excitement.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the story does give several Masters and Servants convincing exposition. The cast is large, so it is difficult to develop them as characters, but that is probably not necessary. Instead, the audience seeks for them to be developed as players in the Holy Grail War. This is well-executed. We know what the pieces are... but we still want to see them in action.\\n\\n\r\nAlso that awful cliffhanger at the end of the season... Just awful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 9]\\n\\n\r\nThe art is always on point. The style is mature and serious, so there is nothing stylistically impressive going on. But the art never falters, the character design is strong, the background work is strong, the characters fit into the background exceptionally well, and even the CGI looks great.\\n\\n\r\nI am wishing for stronger action sequences. Better choreography or at least more successful spectacle reached by speed, scale, shot composition, cuts... something.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 7]\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good. Strong use of dynamics. Voice acting is good and never seriously falters. That being said there isn't a whole lot of memorable stuff happening here. But the sound is good.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 8]\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are developed appropriately for their role in the show. This is a battle royale that should be stacked to the brim with political intrigue. I would say that the stage is set for the variety of moral judgments in the cast to make exciting plot swings. I'm giving Season 2 the benefit of the doubt.\\n\\n\r\nSome characters are not properly elaborated, but I trust they will be later.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 6]\\n\\n\r\nThe show never gives the feeling that it has any real stakes, so that sucks any plot-driven enjoyment out of the series. Seriously. It is supposed to be a battle royale, and something SORT OF happens to one master. Barely.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is OK and looks good, but it could be paced faster and have much stronger choreo.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 7]\\n\\n\r\nThis series is survived by its sequel. Maybe this does a good enough job setting up the pins, maybe it doesn't. Too early to tell. Sometimes the first entry in a series can still succeed very well because it contains a closed arc. Fate/Zero doesn't really go for that. And sure, it doesn't necessarily have to... if it sets up Season 2 well enough. Will it?\\n",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review will count for both seasons of the series.\r\nI\u2019m sure anyone who is genuinely reading this review knows what Fate/Zero is, as it has gained a large following in the anime community, from, what only I could discern being the high quality of the animation and the fanbase it has already received from its predecessor series, what many often refer to as Deen/Stay Night. It has been generally positively reviewed by the community, but, as one could most definitely tell from my score of it, I don\u2019t particularly follow that train of thought. This is due, in a brief exposition for those whodon\u2019t have the patience for long reviews, to the uselessness of many of its character, the somewhat pretentious philosophy of said characters, and the general slow and not well executed thought. However, I will say that it does have good ideas, they are just not properly fleshed out to the point where I can award the show points for it. The premise means nothing if there is bad execution. With that being said, allow me to get into the actual review.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nMany characters in the show have their backstory shown and their goals explained (if not drastically then at least in part), however, this in and of itself does not justify being warranted as having good characters. The first main point against the quality of these characters is there general uselessness. Many, such as Lancer, Archibald, Sola-Ui, Irisviel, Waver, etc., do not have any main role to serve in the show. That is not to say that all characters should make a considerable donation to the plot, but they should at least be used in a way where they felt they had some limited impact. Tokiomi, for instance, was said to have had an infallible plan and was pushed to be one of the main contributors to the story, but never did anything except burn Kariya and get killed by Kirei. \\n\r\n\tThere are also instances in the show where character development is shown. Waver developed the most in the show and got a surprising amount of screentime considering he was one of the lesser mages in the main characters. Saber also had character development, however, it didn\u2019t really feel like it made much sense. She let a few sentence speech by Rider change her views on her philosophy that she had followed for many years, and could have easily been told of her oversight by Lancelot, who seemingly left the roundtable instead of just telling Saber how he really felt. The worst offender of bad character development is Kirei, who basically got told by Gilgamesh what to do, and then ended in desiring to make people suffer, a very bland and typical villainesc goal for a series that is supposed to have grey characters.\\n\r\n\tThe historical inconsistencies, such as Arthur\u2019s Gender, his existence as a whole, and Iskander\u2019s height were a little off-putting, but that is just a nitpick. It also bugs me that they had so many better historical figures to chose from then what they chose. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to have Arthuria face off against, say, William the Conqueror. That sure would be interesting. Wasted potential, I suppose.\\n\r\n\tThe character\u2019s sense of philosophy is always annoying. Irisviel basically has no reason for adhering to Emiya\u2019s philosophy, and Emiya himself has a very silly goal, considering that he wants to save humanity by killing all who stand in his way, a thing a normal human being would clearly find to be repulsive. The whole honor thing as spouted by Lancer and Saber is basically a time waster and a method from the authors to make the characters \u201cdance their dance\u201d as they say. There is also Caster\u2019s philosophy, which is so stupid it doesn\u2019t even deserve mentioning. There should always a motive that would be befitting of a human to do their own actions, which is certainly not what I see here. Anyway, that is enough rambling about the characters, let us move onward.\\n\\n\r\nThe Plot:\\n\r\n\tThe Plot drags its feet along in the first season and then shoots off like a rocket towards the end of the second season. The first season was almost entirely skippable, with the only things missing being the death of Assassin (not that they mattered to the show anyway), and the near death of Archibald, which I guess mattered but he instead died in the 2nd season after an entire sequence with Emiya that didn\u2019t really matter. The conversation between Gilgamesh, Iskander, and Arthuria was also important in some ways.\\n\r\n\tA minor thing was that they shoved in Emiya\u2019s backstory in the middle of the 2nd season for practically no reason, considering that it had absolutely nothing to do with the events that were conspiring in the present. It was also boring as it moved far too fast and was basically edge lord material in the first episode. The 2nd episode was good for what it was, but if was still far too rushed.\\n\r\n\tAnother thing that bothered me was the powers that the characters were using. The masters were said to be all strong with magic (excluding Ryuunosuke and Waver), but the only people to ever show it were Tokiomi, Kariya, Archibald, and Emiya (and Kirei slightly but that doesn\u2019t really count). Even when they did show their magical powers, it only mattered to the story and only caused damage when they were being used by Emiya. It made it feel like Emiya was so much powerful than everyone else and it killed the tension. If that were the case, all of the noble houses should\u2019ve hired people like him instead of wasting times with these useless fools. The Servants also had the power to teleport and ride any vehicle they so desire (as explained by Arthuria in the first season), however, they never did. Gilgamesh could\u2019ve easily wiped the competition and Rider could\u2019ve defeated Saber if he didn\u2019t just simply run away and actually decided to fight. It really kills the tension when you know that these characters could instantly defeat opponents but don\u2019t due to the plot demanding so.\\n\r\n\tThe whole setting of the show also irks me. Why would the houses agree to send only a few men into battle when they could gather a literal magical army in order to claim the holy grail. Also, the holy grail was used before, in which case, what wishes did it grant and why doesn\u2019t one magical family rule over the world at this point. Something like Emiya\u2019s and the royal families\u2019 ambitions should have already been carried out if the grail truly has unlimited power like the legend states. Also, everyone should already know that the grail has bad intentions if people have seen the wishes fulfilled before. There also very little possibility that the ever attentive governments of the world would not know about these magical abilities. It also doesn\u2019t make sense why the Church would allow magic considering it was heavily panned by early church philosophers as being the work of the devil and his followers. \\n\r\n\tMy other gripes with the story were already listed in the character section, so I will not bother to repeat them here, but I am sure I missed some and will have to come back to this later.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art/Animation:\\n\r\n\tDespite the lack of good choreography in many of the fight scenes, the animation was good for the most part. The art style didn\u2019t really fit the dark tone that the story was going for, but considering that the original Fate/Stay Night has these types of designs, there was really no way around that so I won\u2019t fault them too much for that. It has good detail on most of everything and does sometimes give the impression that the surroundings could be an actual place while not losing the stylistic look of the original. Animation, however, can not save this series from being the disaster that it was. \\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack:\\n\r\n\tNothing really to say here, I, personally, didn\u2019t notice any pieces that were too memorable or too forgettable. The music fit well with the series, I suppose, and there was never a time where I thought the music was misplaced. The sound effects for the series are also fairly good. However, this should not be considered a major category to logically find the quality of any show, at least not to the same extent that the Story and Characters are.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\n\tFate/Zero was a series that certainly had potential, but failed to capitalize on it. The plot felt contrived at points, and stupid at others. The characters had the potential to be written well, as the writers seem to have known what they were doing with a few of them, however, most were completely useless and felt as if they were more of an excuse to elongate the anime rather than to be genuinely good. The sound and animation are great, for the most part, and is probably the reason why you should watch this show if you decide to do so after reading this review. It certainly could have been a fantastic anime to have been remembered for years after, but instead ended up as another overhyped show that pops up once ever couple of years. At least, that is my educated opinion. I have been Kakorat859, and this has been Kakorat\u2019s review of Fate/Zero. Be sure to be safe and have a nice day.\\n",

Mages that pair themselves with famous heroes from the past in order to pursue the holy grail? Excuse me? \r\nBut, what I got in this anime was an extraordinarily complex look at the conflict in the human condition. It is a philosophical exploration of age-old questions regarding leadership, servanthood, love, evil, and the salvation of humanity. The action is fantastic and enhances, rather than detracts, from the story and character development. The animation is superb and the use of CG effects istastefully done and combines itself delicately with the animation. The music was BEAUTIFUL and I can't WAIT to get the soundtrack at my next opportunity. The openings and endings were gorgeous and memorable (I frequently get them stuck in my head). \\n\\n\r\nThough there were so many characters present in this show, I very easily grew extremely attached to all of them. There are deaths in this show and each one hit me hard (either in the emotionally vulnerably spots or in the mental pondering). In my opinion, this story is really about two opposing characters when you boil it down to its essence: Emiya Kiritsugu and Kotomine Kirei. \\n\\n\r\n(This is for the ENTIRE series (i.e. Season 1 and 2)\\n\\n\r\nKiritsugu's backstory episodes, for example, are literally the two best episodes of anime I have ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are going into this expecting a fluffy, light, happy anime with lots of Dragon Ball Z-esque fights, you will be disappointed. This is literally a gold-standard anime that is the BEST of the BEST. I am still reeling over the ending and, though some may find it dark, I was impressed that they held nothing back and the feeling I was left with was one of battered and broken, but still present, hope.",

The artwork is brilliant, incorporating a number of different charter styles to embody their personalities and the battle sequences look incredible. The cast is large and diverse, with varied amounts of screen time per episode, although there isa focus on certain cast members. It is slow paced at times, but thats intentional, its building up into an absolute epic. It has moments of intense action, comedy but also very thoughtful and emotional scenes also.

            "content": "This review is to cover both seasons of this anime. There is a lot of hype surrounding this series, and it does deserve good marks. This is a very visually appealing anime and it's filled with amazing action. I love some of the characters, and really love the concept. Since this is a prequel, it already had a solid fanbase when it was released. It's the crazed fan reviews that made me give this series a look.\r\nFrom the beginning you're thrown from character to character as the story simply starts. There is a lot going on, but it's not difficult to follow. I feel thatit is missing a proper setup (probably due to it's prequel status). Visually, I was impressed from the start, but I had no attachment to any of the characters even after a few episodes. I had never seen Fate/Stay Night, and someone had recommended I watch this first to see them in chronological order. That may have been a mistake, however, I feel a story needs to at least have a good setup and minimal character development. This series brought up the different mages histories, but saying a character is one way and then showing it are two different things.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters all flip flopped between good and evil personas, but the heroes were the saving grace for this series. They were consistently in character, and their desire to have honorable fights kept them the stars as the story trudged on. Every one of the mages played dirty at one point or another, which is understandable, but it made it difficult to root for any of them. \\n\\n\r\nThis is not a happy tale, and if you've seen Fate/Stay Night then you already expect a depressing story to some degree. It has a dark feel throughout, and there's a lot of deceit and backstabbing as the mages attempt to win by any means necessary.\\n\\n\r\nThis particular series gets high marks on the art, sound and characters (though I feel more on the hero side), but I personally found the story/plot lacking in development and I wasn't waiting for each episode with any kind of anticipation. It's sort of the opposite of the series that chronologically follows (which is older so lacks in the art/sound but makes up in story and character development).\\n\\n\r\nIn short, it's a good anime and worth watching, but I would watch Fate/Stay Night before this one so you don't have to worry about setup and development.",
