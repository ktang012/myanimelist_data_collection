            "content": "This was probably one of the most polar animes of Fall 2013; either you love it, or you thought it was boring. Enjoyment of Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shuushoku wo Ketsui Shimashita (Yuusha-ni henceforth, damn..) relies entirely on the perception of Fino Bloodstone, the main character. \r\nFino Bloodstone is an aloof, kind, and incompetent girl who has come to work at the Leon magical appliances store due to not being able to become the next Demon Lord. There, she meets Raul Chaser who is also working at Leon due to not being able to become a Hero. From that description alone, you canalready tell that \"I Couldn't Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job\" (the direct English translation of this anime) has a mediocre story. Even though this anime has its dark moments and attempts to tell a dramatic narrative, let's be honest; it fails at it. You can't really take an anime seriously if it's shoving breasts  and panties in your face every other scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice in Yuusha-ni is probably the first noticeable polarizing aspect of it. Breasts. Panty shots. Suggestive scenes. Expect lots of them; Yuusha-ni has no intent on hiding its ecchi glory. There are the people who absolutely hate fanservice, claiming it to be the Demon Lord's offspring herself (see what I did there?). Then, there are the ecchi enthusiasts who watch anime solely FOR fanservice. You know which kind of anime watcher you are; delve into this anime accordingly.\\n\\n\r\nFor all intents and purposes, Yuusha-ni should be seen as a (light) romantic comedy, with ecchi elements to it. You should watch it with that exact mindset; otherwise, you'll just come out disappointed. For what its worth, Yuusha-ni is fantastic. It had me laughing like crazy every episode. Fino is such a fun character, and this anime is just plain silly. If you love light-hearted ecchi-based comedy, Fino's personality (her cluelessness in particular), or hell, even her looks, you'll love Yuusha-ni. However, if you are neutral to fanservice, no one can tell you if you are compatible; this is just one of those anime that you have to dive in and watch the first episode to find out for yourself.",

            "content": "Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shuushoku wo Ketsui Shimashita is literally the translation of \u201cI Couldn't Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job.\u201d With a title that long, it\u2019s probably difficult to take such a show seriously. Why even bother reading the synopsis? The title is what you get and our main male protagonist in the show, Raul Chase, takes a job small shop called Magic Shop Leon. Raul himself is no ordinary young man because his origins traces him back to Hero School where he was a former Hero candidate. Like a carte in a restaurant, this show hasa list of tasty selections to offer. And if you didn\u2019t see it coming before, then you should have now. The show is saturated with fan service so take it reluctantly or leave it home altogether.\\n\\n\r\nThe series can be abbreviated simply as \u201cYu-Sibu\u201d and is based off the light novel of the same name written by Jun Sakyou. The initial premise sounds generic and unoriginal. After all, one cannot help but think of \u201cThe Devil is a Part-Timer\u201d without a second thought. While both series shares similar premises, Yu-Sibu lacks what The Devil is a Part-Timer had: an engaging and energetic humorous tale between a hero and a devil.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, Yu-Sibu takes place in the modern setting of Japan. Despite having fantasy themes, the show ventures into a more realistic zone of portraying the working environment; or at least so it tries. The series starts off with some familiarity as we see what happens with Raul. Battered, humiliated, and defeated, he begins a new life as a salesman at a local magical store. If the show was depicted as a slice of life story, the series would have no problem with presenting Raul\u2019s life like a biography. Unfortunately, the fantasy element enters his busy life in the form a young girl named Fino Bloodstone. Here is where it gets complicated because the girl is not just human, she\u2019s also a demon lord\u2019s child.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re coming into this series with expectations, fan service will be one of those. This is thanks to Fino and her clueless mind. Her lack of common sense not only gets herself into trouble but others as well on many various occasions. It doesn\u2019t help by the fact that she is unconscious of situations when she wakes up nude next to Raul. Unlike most female protagonists in the typical harem series genre, Fino does not panic (much anyways) but instead question why Raul reacts in such an astonishing way. The lack of chemistry from the beginning makes this show\u2019s characterization look like a cookie cutter without any dynamics. Luckily over time, there are some development for the duo as Fino gets more situated to her new life. However, the series still shamelessly advertises her character as the eye candy. This is supported by her clumsiness that gets herself into trouble on many occasions as well as compromising positions.\\n\\n\r\nNo fantasy romance is complete without a rival such as Airi Ortinet, the mature older woman (Ceara August), foolish (Nova Luminous), senpai (Lore Beriferal), or the sidekick (Lamdimia Do Aximemor). The series has a package of these coming in all shapes and sizes literally. Because the series has fan service, the camera angle often focuses the girls\u2019 movements on areas where you may raise some eyebrows in response. It never hides the fan service either as in a particular episode, the girls decide to pull out the old trick in the book by advertising themselves with swimsuits. It\u2019s odd on most occasions that the girls in this series has little care about their sexual orientation. Only some of the more traditional characters like Airi shows emotions during embarrassing moments especially in her lascivious bunny outfit. \\n\\n\r\nThe series does maintain its serious tone on occasions though. Most of this comes with Fino\u2019s road of helping out at the store. Her intentions are genuine and she really wants to learn more about her job. The series captures her moments of discovery as she learns more about ideas in the human world. These include tasks such as simple greetings while working at the front counter. Not to mention the fact that Fino has the mind of a child, she often make mistakes but strives to learn from them. In one particular episode, she puts all her effort in order to impress Raul and everyone.\\n\\n\r\nFor the story itself, it shifts between fantasy and reality on various occasions. The story picks up later on as we find out some startling revelations. The past comes back like a dagger with its sharp edge pointing at Raul. In various ways, the series doesn\u2019t entirely neglect itself without the initial set up from the beginning. The problem is the execution being slow paced and utterly sudden.\\n\\n\r\nAbsurd is also an underrated word to be used to describe this show. For whatever reason, Nova often lets others take advantage of her such as the dirty old man that comes to visit on occasions. Additionally, humans also sees demons as vile evil but Raul treats Fino with care. It\u2019s peculiar the sense that Raul was defeated by a demon lord and stuck in the situation he is now. Yet, he never plots for revenge directly or take out his frustrations towards Fino. (well only when she ends up scaring away the customers) Surprisingly enough also, Raul never takes advantages of the compromising positions he gets himself into. In a way, he is more tolerable than the typical male harem although he isn\u2019t immune to nosebleeds or lewd thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of comedy, the show honestly tries a bit too hard with repetitive clich\u00e9s that we see often in harem series. While the series negates the presentation of a beach episode, it still keeps its fan service dosage high with sexual innuendos. The way Fino wakes up every day in the morning, the tentacle monster, bunny girl outfit, and girls in bikinis advertising themselves are just a few examples. Most of the girls\u2019 outfits are designed with excessively short skirts where ladders are a showcase to their positions. If designs tries to hides some of the body parts, action scenes will shed them off. Speaking of action, the series does have maintain somewhat of consistency with the sword fighting, armor, and magic. Unfortunately, most of it is obscured by its strange comedy where it only occasionally shines when the plot is at its core. Wait, did I just say \u2018plot\u2019? An ecchi/fantasy series with a plot?! How remarkable. The romance itself is also blend and this is again thanks to Fino\u2019s absentmindedness. Her trivial mind cannot even comprehend the simple term of a \u2018girlfriend\u2019. On the other hand, Raul seems to have small inklings of feelings or at least lust for Fino in the forms for daydreams. The duo may have some chemistry but their relationship is senseless and incompatible. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation of this series is about as generic as it can get. The way the girls are designed along with their outfits is suggestive. Most of the women in this show also has absurdly big breasts that bounces in uniform. The OP song is highly innovative on this with no shame at all. Fino\u2019s character is also designed to look like an innocent girl because of her childish behavior. However, she is more like a molded character with a million dollar body but a 2 cent brain. In other cases, the backgrounds of the series is hardly noticeable. There\u2019s nothing extraordinary about the place our main characters work out or venture out throughout the series. Only the fantasy world occasionally has a few noticeable features to say the least. The animation studio Asread is in charge of the production with some odd similarities to their previous work, Shuffle. It\u2019s hard to take the animation style for granted with all the fan service plastered and in the end standing out with little substance. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack wise, the series mostly retains a lighthearted nature because of Fino\u2019s innocence. Some of the more intense action scenes does give off the feeling of how battles should feel like. But in most cases, there\u2019s little chance for praise because the soundtrack lacks a dynamic tone. Even during some of the more emotional scenes, the soundtrack is off balance. Fino\u2019s VA Azusa Todokoro is noticeable with her contagious laugh. (\u201cha, ha, ha\u201d) It\u2019s surprising she can portray her character so well in the case because her relative new experience in voice acting. On the other hand, Raul\u2019s VA Keisuke K\u014dmoto is unfavorably dull and often possessing a commanding tone. The OP song is like a rainbow of fan service of colors. I already mentioned this before but fan service will be something you can\u2019t avoid, at least not without diving into a wave of bouncing breasts.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to label this series as enjoyable because it\u2019s generic plot and characters. While it does try to characterize Fino\u2019s discovery and development on various occasions, the show doesn\u2019t redeem itself thanks to her own lack of common sense. There\u2019s little sense in this show either with its main plot or romance subplot. Surprisingly enough, Raul isn\u2019t a weak man and doesn\u2019t give into temptations like the typical harem protagonist. Unfortunately though, Raul is just the common working man with little sense of humor. The humor in this show itself also tries far too hard on various occasions fused with fan service, clich\u00e9s, and gags. In the end, it\u2019ll be up to you to enjoy this series or not. It\u2019s not aimed for a war between humans/demons or is one about how a human and demon can find love with each other. It\u2019s about working in the real world - a tale between a young man and a demon.\\n",

            "content": "Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore we Shibushibu Shuushoku wo Ketsui Shimashita (this is a mouthful!), or simply, Yusibu, is a rather...interesting addition to the demon king genre of anime.  I have not seen a more ridiculously long title as this since Noucome, so I thought that I would give it a try.  Here's my review.  (The review is 10% off if you're the first person to read it.)\r\nStory (7.43/10):  Have you ever played an RPG game before that involves you, the player, as a hero, questing and adventuring to go and defeat the dark evil of the realm?  (Games like: FinalFantasy, Legend of Zelda, Fire Emblem.)  After you finish the game, a game over appears after completing it, right?  And without a second thought, you go about your way, happy that you conquered the evil of that world.  But do you ever think about the afterthought of said world?  \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Yusibu is what could be considered as in my eyes, as a show that continues the story of the world, after it was saved.  Because the demon lord in Yusibu has been defeated valiantly by some unnamed person, all of the heroes-in-training, including our main protagonist Raul, are reluctantly disbanded and sent away, as there is no more evil for them to fight, and therefore, no need for heroes.  It is because of that, that Raul must work at a magic shop to sell magical goods such as a \"hair dryer\" and a \"refrigerator\" in order to take care of himself.  (btw, magic = electricity in this world).  It is then on, that a new person by the name of Fino comes in, wanting a job, meeting Raul, and the story goes on from there.  \\n\\n\r\nI won't lie.  This exposition really reeled me in.  The sheer ridiculousness that this beginning exposition had, was more than proof enough that I was going to enjoy this to some extent.  And, I was gladly rewarded.  The story itself isn't really that difficult to understand.  It mainly follows the lives of Raul and Fino, as the two of them live their lives, working at the equivalent of a small department store in our world.  As such with commercial market, and animes involving businesses, the general idea of bigger competition, new products, the payday, and breaktime are all featured in the episodes, giving a very supernatural slice of life feel to the series.  The pacing is rather steady the whole way through, and didn't feel rushed or anything.  \\n\\n\r\nAt the end though, the story threw me for a loop, as the whole series turned into your stereotypical \"female lead is in a situation that the male lead must save her from\" sort of bullcrap that exists throughout all of the anime world.  It did feel a bit different when watching it, and it was executed in an original and different way; but all in all, it was still the same thing, regardless.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't bad in any way, shape, or form, and it wasn't executed poorly either.  It was just a little bit cliched and generic with an interesting twist to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.43/10): The characters are an interesting mix.  Some are developed and explored to a large degree, and others are just there to appease the perverted crowd of the anime fanbase (you know who you are).  \\n\\n\r\nRaul Chaser.  True to his name, Raul chases his dreams, only to have them be brutally crushed before he could even start.  As the main protagonist, Raul gets a greater majority of development, as he begins the series as an ungrateful twat who can't appreciate what he has, to someone who's happy for what he's accomplish and/or done.  He's not a bad character per se, as he can kick ass when need be, as well as being an awesome guy with some common sense and little to no denseness, but he is still quite dull at times.\\n\\n\r\nFINO BLOODSTONE.  She needs to be in all caps because, she makes this show what it is.  Fino is the daughter of the late demon lord that inhibited the demon world.  A charismatic and enthusiastic girl who always tries her best and gets happy at the smallest of things.  She mainly occupies the role as being the show's major comic relief, as she can turn any situation or object into a depressing and sadistic one at the mention of about ten or so words.  Also, she's completely shameless, being, for the most part, ok for our main lead Raul to see her completely nude (A rare sight in anime, I find.)  Fino herself is the show's main focus, and it emphasizes that a lot, focusing the last couple episodes on her position as the demon lord's daughter, and throughout the series, building up her familiarity with the human world.  While she definitely is a bit much, the show heavily relies on her to carry the show along, which is a bit unfair considering that the side characters get jack.  (Other that Airi, who gets a minuscule amount.)\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is gigantic, consisting of about 95% of the cast.  All of them are associated with Raul in some way, either being a coworker or friend, adding into either the comedy aspect of the show, or the non-existent story aspect.  The ratio of men to women is about 2:7, so it's kind of obvious what you're in for when you're watching this show.  I'll get to that later.  Troupes include a proud loli, a tsundere with a bust complex, a kuudere, an overly happy person, the shy girl with the crush on the main lead, the coworker, and even a pervy old man.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Yusibu is a mix of well developed characters, and cardboard cutouts, creating a mix that works as well as it could've done for this show.  I wouldn't bank on this show being the most developed show ever. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound (7.02/10 and 7.00/10):  The art is good, for starters.  The palette used in this show is a more lighter tone, veering over to a whiter shade of coloring for this anime.  It is quite pleasing to the eye to look at, and the quality doesn't really dim down or anything.  The comedic scenes are also fun to look at, as they have your usual standard fare of simplified drawings for exaggerated expressions.  \\n\\n\r\nNow...the character designs.  There's a big, big reason that this show has been walled off by some people in the anime community  (Make that two big, big reasons.)  And that is, of course, the fanservice.  While the actual facial designs and looks of the anime are pretty well done, (except the awkward eyebrow colors that I see on the majority of the cast), the dimensions of said characters remains to be...determined.  5 out of the 7 female cast members are very big in the chest area, and as such, according to the laws of anime physics, each one of them individual breasts must move independently even due to the slightest movement of the body.  As an ecchi show, it's obvious that this should be standard fare.  But even so, they do go out of their way of glorifying it even further, and it just feels so weird to watch it.  Personally, I'm fine with some ecchi, but it was just a bit over the top for me.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was good, but forgettable.  The OP and ED were quite similar sounding, and sounded good, but they didn't stick in my head like other anime tracks, and they didn't seem that great to listen to.  Mood fillers are mood fillers.  No extra explanation needed.  Voice acting on the other hand was a slightly different story altogether.  Tadokoro Azusa does a fantastic job at being Fino, and I felt like it was worth mentioning because she does such a good representation of the character.  (Hope she gets more roles in the future.)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment (7.41/10):  Large breasts and other ecchi complaints, Yusibu was a rather interesting series to watch.  It was intriguing enough for me to start and finish all the way to the end, and gave me a somewhat satisfying feeling after finishing it.  The story was an interesting idea that was executed as well as it could've been, and the characters were one noted, but still fun to watch.  One thing to note, is the non-existent romance.  The possible romance in the series goes absolutely nowhere, and was rather pointless to begin with since all they did was blush every now and then, and gaze into each others eyes, making you want to reach into your screen going, \"KISS!  KISS!\"  I will admit that I throughly enjoyed it regardless.  By no means is this a required anime for people to watch, but it does provide some nice, time-killing entertainment with adequate comedy, occasional female molestation, and a cliched ending that was bought from the cliche store on overused ave.  Good for killing time, not good for if you want to watch something really good and meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.01/10\\n\\n\r\nHere's a review card to see how much you enjoyed our service.

Well, if his point was to maintain that \"Moe\" thing then he could have put them in such outfits that is befitting of a typical department store clerk where the girls are wearing heels and min pencil cut skirts and not that high-school uniform thing while doing cooking class, the guys would be better off just wearing a shirt and tie.    \\n\\n\r\nGood 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound - I pretty much like Fino's evil laugh....HA!HA!HA! Also I like Sarah's cutsy voice as well as Elsa sweet voice. I also like the opening and the closing theme as well, Raul..........his voice sounded like some dork who can do anything right.\\n\\n\r\nDecent 4.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- At one point I kinda like Fino for being this good demon who wanted a simple life and has to undergo a lot of adjustment to fit it, but I kinda hate the fact that she is that naive about customer service and a bit clumsy. Raul on the other hand is a dichotomy, where at one point he still wanted to live in the past where the war between the human and demon exist and yet in another point he cares for Fino very much as a co worker, however he still plays a typical harem guy who is too dumb to be aware of his harems feelings. Sarah, I kinda like her positive thinking, but I hated her constant teasing of Raul with Fino. As for the rest of the cast, they did their part well, but not much a any flare since their roles were just too simplistic to say the least.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFair 6.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- In all fairness it was enjoyable enough to a certain degree, but not that much at all, since it was pretty obvious that studio Asread focuses on the fanservice than anything else. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPathetic 1.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- I would never understand what's going on in the mind of the writer Jun Sakyou as why did he gave this anime such title \" Y\u016bsha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Sh\u016bshoku o Ketsui Shimasta\" or I can't become a hero so I decided to get a job.\" Then again, this anime did live up to its title, but the problem is that to whom does this anime's title refer to, was some what of a \"DUH.\" Btw, even if the plot and story are very good, the fact is more emphasis was given on the fanservice and that's that. Adios. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

There is also something with the eye drawing that was kind of unique, in a not so good way.\r\nIMO, this isn't my cup of tea series. The female lead is the blockhead in this anime. I will commend the author though, its not a HIGHSCHOOL anime, but for a store. I haven't seen anime's other than this one that are primarily based in a store. Power to them.\r\nThe story is also very poor. Nothing is explained. Supposedly they were heroes inone age, but now they work in a hardware store? And one of the female heroes is also stalking the store? And a daughter of Demon Lord falls out of the sky. Idk, but its too much random for my taste.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, there is a good amount of ecchi moments.\\n\\n\r\nI can't recommend it because I didn't like it BUT if you like random anime non-sense, then I think you will like this one.",

            "content": "Yuushibu, the busty tale of a would-be-hero and would-be-demon-lord working at a magic shop.\r\nYuushibu maximizes attention on its busty character design, and attempt at a lukewarm story of how our would-be-hero and would-be-demon-lord mature into excellent employees.\r\nDoesn't sound too interesting, does it? That's because it really isn't.\r\nYuushibu takes place in a regular human world, where magic is used as some sort of energy supply. In this world, another world exists outside of it. This world is where heroes and the demon lord exist. Well, existed. As it appears, the demon lord was killed, leaving her daughter heir to the demon lord throne. However, since shedoes not want to fulfill her father's title, she leaves the seat of demon lord absent. Without a demon lord present, heroes have no use. Our would-be-hero is unable to become a hero because of the lack of demand, and is therefore thrust to reluctantly take a job at a magic shop. It is there he must train a grey-haired boy by the name of Fino Bloodstone, who is instantly revealed (and I mean REVEALED) to be a woman.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the story develops from that premise. The story has no clear initial plot, and does not emerge until the last couple of episodes. Viewers can enjoy a busty slice-of-life comedy for about 10 episodes, and then dive into a quickly tossed plot that ties events from the past together. In all honesty, the story was quite dull and uninteresting. It is the other elements of this anime that will keep viewers watching, but it is still no excuse for such an uneventful story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Yuushibu is a bit of an acquired taste. It's not as exquisitely drawn as other anime today, but it is by no means an eyesore. The bust physics are completely illogical, and the colouring is par at best. The animation is a tad choppy, and viewers will see abrupt jumps in frames. The character models, aside from one character, seem to be carbon copies of each other. Essentially every female is drawn with a well-endowed body; there is only one loli character. The lack of variety in an anime that uses these \"plot devices\" to lure in the male demographic acts more of a liability than an asset. Sometimes it is hard to differentiate between the female cast because they all look the same.\\n\\n\r\nYuushibu had a passable OP and ED. The OP, \"Extra Revolution\" by ZAQ, is upbeat, and ANNOYINGLY catchy; it may take a few listens to determine if it is a likeable track or not. The ED, \"Sticking Places\" by Sphere is a gentle yet energetic song. On a side note, the members of Sphere actually make frequent appearances in the anime. The members voice themselves, and their song often makes cameos in the anime through radios, concerts, etc.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voicing, the voice cast does a respectable job. The most notable performance was by Tadokoro Azusa, voice of Fino Bloodstone. Her laugh is quite memorable. She captured Fino's archetype well. The rest of the cast did an average job. No seiyuu will be winning an award for this performance, however.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Yuushibu were bland. Yuushibu did not successfully create interesting archetypes that made the anime more captivating. The male lead, Raul Chaser, is portrayed as a responsible yet cowardly man in the face of fanservice. In other words, he is your typical faceless MC-kun in harems. Of course, very few watch harems for the males anyways. The females show their archetypes rather quickly, but almost none of them are engaging. Fino Bloodstone is an energetic, naive busty girl. She starts out from not knowing any culture differences; she often makes decisions based on her life back in the demon world, like assuming every customer is fond of blood. Her naive mind also causes her to be utterly confused and ask Raul Chaser where does the store sell money. Aside from Fino, viewers have a mild array of female choices. They aren't bad, but there is close to nothing going for them that will make them memorable characters.\\n\\n\r\nYuushibu is best enjoyed as an ecchi comedy. The drama, romance, story-telling, and cast development are all so poor that it's a pity to see Yuushibu even attempting it. The more serious dialogue is corny, predictable, and lackluster. However, the comedic dialogue was at times pretty well-written.\\n\\n\r\nYuushibu is by no means a must-watch anime. The story is awful, the dialogue sounds like it came from a novice author. Of course, these elements are not the main meat of what is to be critiqued. It's the fanservice, the voice cast, and the comedy that must be analyzed. The fanservice does not appeal to a wide audience because the majority of the female cast have the same body. The voice cast for the most part does an excellent job. The comedy does a fine job when it can.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Yuushibu is best described as a bust*. \\n\\n\\n\r\n*no pun intended",

The characters were funny and the harem concept was not overdone or annoying. \r\nIf you love Fino(or Phino) and Raul you ll love the show. It seemed that only 2 characters were truly given importance in this show and the rest were in supporting roles though they had hints of such potential.\r\nThe idea is similar to Devil is a part timer(which is amazing) but I wouldrecommend this series if you can ignore the lewdness(you wont regret it as long as you Dont think/analyze it too much)",

Over-all its actually an enjoyable watch if you can handle fan service. (Spoiler Free)\r\nStory - The story was not so original because Hataraku Maou-sama! already pulled off something like this. But, with the fan service and the way the setting was set gave a new spin on it. What I really wished for most was the story to elaborate a bit more on the pasts of Raul and Fino.\r\nArt - I was a bit skepticalat first, but then it really grew on me. Colorful and really cool at certain points. Very bouncy and raunchy at times though! \\n\\n\r\nSound - Some of the music was actually very catchy, like the violin in some of the fighting scenes. I very much enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Fino reminded me of Nyarko. Very weird and very revealing. Every character had their own personality which added a bit. Not to mention finding out some of a hidden past with a few of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - It was a fun and filling watch. If you have seen many, many, many anime... It may not be original but its definitely at the least a great time waster.\\n\\n\r\nSomething worth watching this year if you have run out of shows!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shuushoku wo Ketsui Shimashita. or Yuushibu for short is by no stretch of the imagination a masterpiece. With that being said, it is also by no means without its merits. Yuushibu is fine; in fact, in places it\u2019s even good. It plays to the strengths of its premise just enough to be considered fun, and that\u2019s ok\u2014allow me to explain why:\r\nThe story of Yuushibu follows Raul Chaser: a would-be hero, if not for the fact that the Demon Lord has already been defeated. With his dreams crushed, and him in need of finding a way to make ends meet,Raul finds himself working for a magic shop, which is humorously setup to parody that of a modern day, Japanese electronics store.\\n\\n\r\nIt is at this point that many people may draw a comparison with Hataraku Maou-sama! and that is certainly not unfounded; however, to suggest that Yuushibu is an imitation of Hataraku Maou-sama! is not giving credit where credit is due. Where Hataraku Maou-sama! poses the question: \u2018what would happen if the Demon Lord showed up in modern day Japan?\u2019, Yuushibu instead asks: \u2018what would happen to a world where the Demon Lord no longer exists?\u2019 They both deconstruct and poke fun at a well-established genre in opposite ways, which is truly a strength of both shows.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Yuushibu ultimately falls short of Hataraku Maou-sama! is unfortunately in how it answers its own question. Yuushibu introduces its heroine, Fino Bloodstone, and from that point on, the majority of the show becomes the Raul and Fino show. That is not to say that this is a bad thing; their interactions are fun and make for easy watching, but it does mean that a lot of characters get sidetracked and used as mere plot devices.\\n\\n\r\nThe show definitely picks up its momentum going into its final arc, questioning the idea of what makes a hero and what makes a villain; but once again, it\u2019s the questions it poses that are more interesting than what actually comes across.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the show\u2019s art is arguably where we can find another strength. Sure, with the exception of Fino and a few other characters, the character designs are mostly bland. This goes for the backgrounds too, which whilst being colourful, aren't really anything special. What makes this show's art a strength, dare I say it, is the way it handles its fan service and ecchiness. I hazard to use the word tasteful, but Yuushibu\u2019s fan service never felt overused or too obscene. It was never the \u2018plot\u2019, if you get what I mean, so I felt it complimented the show more than it harmed it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound on the other hand certainly wasn\u2019t anything to write home about. Not that it detracted from my enjoyment of the show, but it never went beyond what I expected. The same goes for the voice actors too. No one character\u2019s voice stood out as great or annoying\u2014they were all just fine.\\n\\n\r\nSo to wrap things up, is Yuushibu worth watching? Yes, even if it\u2019s just the once. At times, Yuushibu can feel like it's squandering its storytelling potential; but nevertheless, it offers up enough light romance, enough action, and enough fan service to justify the watch. Oh, and that's not even mentioning the Captain Picard cameos throughout!",

            "content": "I'm tempted to give it a really good, but in reality it's really only good towards the beginning and then at the end. I feel like it could have been improved if they stretched the series out more. Despite a few quirks, Fino came off as too sweet for a Demon Lord's daughter and Raul warmed up to her too quickly. I enjoyed the first 3 episodes, tolerated episodes 4-10 (a large serving of slice of life), and pretty much enjoyed 11 and 12. If you liked episode 1, you'll probably like the ending scenes. Personally, my favorite part was seeing Raul interact with hisformer Yuusha friends and then let off a mad laugh in episode 11. Fino can also be fun at times. She's naturally sweet and smiles, but when Raul tells her to smile at customers, she does and starts uncontrollably letting off an \"evil demon\" air. At those times, it's Raul' s face that's the funniest. As far as ecchi goes, it's pretty mild: though there is heavy showing of bare breast and Fino being naked. Episodes 2-3 are pretty much that. If you liked The Devil Is A Part Timer, I'd recommend this. Another thing is that there is almost zero lip to lip contact. That was refreshing. Hope this was helpful. In my mind, Raul was the best character. The others seemed almost typical.",

Then great, because this anime is perfect for you! The women are all dense, because how else would an \"ecchi\" work? Good for you though, because you already can\u2019t handle strong women. They\u2019re also one dimensional characters, because of course, all introspection has to be done by our beloved hero. \r\nSpeaking of whom, Raul is an absolute darling and a complete gentleman (not being sarcastic). After all, he did aspire to be a hero! He was the saving grace ofthe anime. Wish we had more men like him in the real world instead of, you know, the pervs enjoying the \u201cfan service\u201d in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nComparisons with Hatarakou Maou Sama (The Devil is a Part Timer) were to be expected, but apart from the devil and hero being forced to work together in the human world to survive, both anime have different story-lines which were treated very differently. I rated Hatarakou a LOT more, simply because it didn\u2019t have to stoop low enough to objectify already sexualized women. It also had a plot and great characters, something which this anime lacks. Yuushi ni could have been decent, but alas, its fan servicing took whatever little good grace it had left in the eyes of viewers.\\n\\n\r\nSome points I have to make>\\n\r\n# Raul-Phino appeared to share a more of brother-sister relationship. The romance seemed obviously forced.\\n\r\n# Why the FUK does a Star Wars-ish music start playing as soon as the creepy old man makes an appearance?  Randomist shit I've seen in an anime\\n\r\n# Why did the skins of all girls appear as if they were shrink wrapped in plastic? And those pink spots\\n\r\non their skin to highlight a \"rosy\" tint (shoulders, breasts and legs) always appeared as more of a rash. Ugh.\\n\r\n# Why such a long title? I will now have to google it every time before doing any research on Google. Yes, I get the irony. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPS. For those of you jerks enjoying the nipples of Phino, know that she isn\u2019t more than 14-15 at best (argue all you want). \\n",

I feel like in order to have a good show, the main character hasgot to be at least memorable. I do remember the love interest however: she had a good design and was a well rounded character; but, those last few episodes, they just pissed me off. Why? Why the heck did they decide part-way through that it actually needed a story. The magic system already sucked, the MC sucked, the gross CG sucked: it could of at least been reserved as a stupid, but funny slice-of-life. But no, they just had to try to put a story on this thing. It's like trying to clothe Beelzebub, it's just not going to work. All in all, it deserved a 3, more like a high 2.

            "content": "Yuushibu is an Ecchi/Comedy anime with some minor action and romance type aspects. While the premise is similar to The Devil is a Part Timer, the focus of the shows are not.\r\nThe story is simple. Raul Chaser is working at a magic items store (instead of electricity things are run by magic) but his real dream is to be a hero. However, because the demon lord was defeated there is no need for them anymore. One day a \"guy\" walks into the store and applies... this \"guy\" happens to be the demon lords kid. Okay, the \"guy\" is really a girl named Fino, the demonlords daughter.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing this anime does very well is executing the premise. Each episode the characters (mostly Fino) learns something about her job or life outside the demon realm in general. At the same time... it kind of reflects like real life situations and such. It even had this whole thing about the big department store out pricing the small local shops by literally working small demons to death. I want to say that I really like the world they built in the anime. I thought using normal household appliances and having them powered by magic in this fantasy world was a great idea.\\n\\n\r\nYes a big aspect of the show is fan-service and honestly in the first episode it's not that well placed. However, I don't think people should mind that much after that episode. There is a lot of fan-service but eventually it's almost completely becomes integrated into the story/situations rather than just being there for the sake of having it (okay I totally realize the situations are set up for fan service but come on)\\n\\n\r\nThe main pair in Raul and Fino make a great team. Fino starts out very naive (and mainly stays that way) but she does learn concepts at a regular basis. Not only this but she actually has actual insight into some concepts which automatically makes her smarter than 99% of anime females. While Raul's character and the way he progresses is rather predictable but he changes gradually as Fino learns. He learns through teaching and experience and not through endless exposition.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had a complaint is that the show is too straight forward and cliche. It does everything it sets out to do very well, has likeable characters that get development over the entirety of the series, and does not faulter on sound or animation. However, the ending is essentially saving the day because of the power of LOVE and saving a floating pair of chesticles.",

He works in a magic item store, reluctantly of course, when a new girl appears with a resume in hand and wants to work at the same store. The new girl, named Fino, has a really interesting background, so interesting that it can change the course of the world!\r\n The story, for the most part is a very fun slice of life about working in aretail store when competition emerges, forcing everyone to work harder to make the store more known and popular. It's not until the last 3-4 episodes where a plot appears from quite literally no where and changes the direction of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n The girls, Fino, Elsa, Airi, Nova, Saera, Lore and Lamdimia are all really insanely cute and pretty. The art style, like many harems and anime that want to accentuate cuteness, use red blemish marks on the skin, typically around the thighs, breasts, cheeks, elbows shoulders, things of that nature; it works really well and it make all the girls so much cuter! ! !\\n\\n\r\n Fino, the main girl of the anime, is a totally adorable demon with a bright passion for wanting to succeed and to become something with her life; she's also has an incredibly infectious cheerful and peppy personality, making her a lot of fun to watch and care for. Raul, our main guy for I Could Become a Hero, is like most MC's in a harem based situation; he gets flustered when breasts are near him, he loses composure when a girl clings to him, but aside from that, he can be a cool guy, he'd obviously be a lot better if he made some magic happen.\\n\\n\r\n There are some minor characters that become a little important during the last 2-3 episodes of the anime, but I don't think I really enjoyed seeing the drastic and entirely different direction the anime went into. I guess in many ways, it makes sense and works, but I'd rather not have seen Fino get manipulated and toyed with.\\n\\n\r\n The music in I Couldn't Become a Hero, is surprisingly good. The OP and ED are quite amazing and will probably find the artist who did the songs, but the background music was good and so were the ambient based sounds, I didn't really expect that at all.\\n\\n\r\n Like I mentioned before, the art style is one that accentuates cuteness and is animated in such a way to make sure you notice the bouncing boobies and beautiful girls, a lot of good.\\n\\n\r\n I Couldn't Become a Hero is really a show for people looking for a lot of ecchi. We have pantsu shots, both the front and the back, we have beautiful bouncing breasts, we have nipples and amazing ass shots. The first couple episodes start off really strong on the fan service aspect too, even having a couple tentacle(hands) scenes that when explode, turn into a white mess....",

            "content": "Is it just me, or do the Japanese love giving their anime over-the-top, overly long, ridiculous titles. I Couldn't Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job is the story about a young man who went to an academy where people trained to defeat the Dark Lord. Unfortunately, the Dark Lord was defeated before he even graduated and the academy went under. Destitute and in need of money, Raul Chaser reluctantly gets a job working for a magic appliance retail store. Months later, another person also begins working there - the Dark Lord's only daughter, Fino Bloodstone. Can't you just smell therecipe for disaster here?\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those anime that I feel is underrated. Sure, it's not the best. In fact, most of it is downright cliched. However, I think this anime understands that it's a cliche and doesn't pretend to be something else. The humor, while seen in every ecchi anime series, is well-done and over-the-top. The ecchi is, well, ecchi. There's not much that can be said there. This is an anime that has plenty of boobs for young men who want fan service to enjoy. While I'm sometimes sketchy about ecchi, this anime is of the ecchi genre, so pandering to fan service actually works here - unlike some of the other anime I have watched.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is okay. Honestly, I've seen better, but I've seen worse as well. This is a middle-tier anime, where the animations aren't terrible, but not amazing to the point where you're thinking, \"wow! The animation is so flawless, and the frame rate is amazing!\" I will admit, though, that I do like the artwork. It's sort of standard, but it's still nice. The girls, in particular, are well designed. I suppose that's only natural, since this is an ecchi anime. No one's gonna want to watch an anime about boobs and nude scenes if the female's weren't hotter than sin.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this being an ecchi anime where most of the plot is, um, well, PLOT, this does have a somewhat interesting story. It also makes you wonder. What happens to the people who tried to become a hero but, due to unforeseen circumstances, never got the chance? This story deals with a new, intriguing aspect to heroism and Dark Lord slaying that I haven't seen before. Raul Chaser is a man who dreamed of defeating the Dark Lord and becoming a hero, yet now he's stuck working at a retail store because none of the vaunted, Dark Lord slaying abilities he has are useful in anything but, well, Dark Lord slaying. Now he has to deal with the fact that he's essentially wasted several years of his life learning how to become a hero in a world where heroes aren't needed. To make matters more interesting, one of his co-workers happens to be the daughter of the Dark Lord that he wanted to kill, which adds a new dynamic to the story.\\n\\n\r\nAside from Raul Chaser, Fino Bloodstone, and Ahri All-A, none of the characters are really touched upon. This isn't as bad as it sounds. Like I said. This is an ecchi anime. Literally. It's genre is ecchi. In an anime where the story is merely an excuse to deliver boob scenes to the audience, character development isn't that important. I was honestly surprised that these three actually received the development they had. Raul and Ahri deal with what it means to live in a world where their skills are no longer needed, and Fino is dealing with the fact that she's a demon, the daughter of the Dark Lord, living in a world that she doesn't understand. While the plot never gets very deep or complex, sticking with mostly comedy and slapstick humor, the way these aspects are pulled off is well-done.",

            "content": "This was probably one of the most polar animes of Fall 2013; either you love it, or you thought it was boring. Enjoyment of Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shuushoku wo Ketsui Shimashita (Yuusha-ni henceforth, damn..) relies entirely on the perception of Fino Bloodstone, the main character. \r\nFino Bloodstone is an aloof, kind, and incompetent girl who has come to work at the Leon magical appliances store due to not being able to become the next Demon Lord. There, she meets Raul Chaser who is also working at Leon due to not being able to become a Hero. From that description alone, you canalready tell that \"I Couldn't Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job\" (the direct English translation of this anime) has a mediocre story. Even though this anime has its dark moments and attempts to tell a dramatic narrative, let's be honest; it fails at it. You can't really take an anime seriously if it's shoving breasts  and panties in your face every other scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice in Yuusha-ni is probably the first noticeable polarizing aspect of it. Breasts. Panty shots. Suggestive scenes. Expect lots of them; Yuusha-ni has no intent on hiding its ecchi glory. There are the people who absolutely hate fanservice, claiming it to be the Demon Lord's offspring herself (see what I did there?). Then, there are the ecchi enthusiasts who watch anime solely FOR fanservice. You know which kind of anime watcher you are; delve into this anime accordingly.\\n\\n\r\nFor all intents and purposes, Yuusha-ni should be seen as a (light) romantic comedy, with ecchi elements to it. You should watch it with that exact mindset; otherwise, you'll just come out disappointed. For what its worth, Yuusha-ni is fantastic. It had me laughing like crazy every episode. Fino is such a fun character, and this anime is just plain silly. If you love light-hearted ecchi-based comedy, Fino's personality (her cluelessness in particular), or hell, even her looks, you'll love Yuusha-ni. However, if you are neutral to fanservice, no one can tell you if you are compatible; this is just one of those anime that you have to dive in and watch the first episode to find out for yourself.",

            "content": "Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shuushoku wo Ketsui Shimashita is literally the translation of \u201cI Couldn't Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job.\u201d With a title that long, it\u2019s probably difficult to take such a show seriously. Why even bother reading the synopsis? The title is what you get and our main male protagonist in the show, Raul Chase, takes a job small shop called Magic Shop Leon. Raul himself is no ordinary young man because his origins traces him back to Hero School where he was a former Hero candidate. Like a carte in a restaurant, this show hasa list of tasty selections to offer. And if you didn\u2019t see it coming before, then you should have now. The show is saturated with fan service so take it reluctantly or leave it home altogether.\\n\\n\r\nThe series can be abbreviated simply as \u201cYu-Sibu\u201d and is based off the light novel of the same name written by Jun Sakyou. The initial premise sounds generic and unoriginal. After all, one cannot help but think of \u201cThe Devil is a Part-Timer\u201d without a second thought. While both series shares similar premises, Yu-Sibu lacks what The Devil is a Part-Timer had: an engaging and energetic humorous tale between a hero and a devil.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, Yu-Sibu takes place in the modern setting of Japan. Despite having fantasy themes, the show ventures into a more realistic zone of portraying the working environment; or at least so it tries. The series starts off with some familiarity as we see what happens with Raul. Battered, humiliated, and defeated, he begins a new life as a salesman at a local magical store. If the show was depicted as a slice of life story, the series would have no problem with presenting Raul\u2019s life like a biography. Unfortunately, the fantasy element enters his busy life in the form a young girl named Fino Bloodstone. Here is where it gets complicated because the girl is not just human, she\u2019s also a demon lord\u2019s child.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re coming into this series with expectations, fan service will be one of those. This is thanks to Fino and her clueless mind. Her lack of common sense not only gets herself into trouble but others as well on many various occasions. It doesn\u2019t help by the fact that she is unconscious of situations when she wakes up nude next to Raul. Unlike most female protagonists in the typical harem series genre, Fino does not panic (much anyways) but instead question why Raul reacts in such an astonishing way. The lack of chemistry from the beginning makes this show\u2019s characterization look like a cookie cutter without any dynamics. Luckily over time, there are some development for the duo as Fino gets more situated to her new life. However, the series still shamelessly advertises her character as the eye candy. This is supported by her clumsiness that gets herself into trouble on many occasions as well as compromising positions.\\n\\n\r\nNo fantasy romance is complete without a rival such as Airi Ortinet, the mature older woman (Ceara August), foolish (Nova Luminous), senpai (Lore Beriferal), or the sidekick (Lamdimia Do Aximemor). The series has a package of these coming in all shapes and sizes literally. Because the series has fan service, the camera angle often focuses the girls\u2019 movements on areas where you may raise some eyebrows in response. It never hides the fan service either as in a particular episode, the girls decide to pull out the old trick in the book by advertising themselves with swimsuits. It\u2019s odd on most occasions that the girls in this series has little care about their sexual orientation. Only some of the more traditional characters like Airi shows emotions during embarrassing moments especially in her lascivious bunny outfit. \\n\\n\r\nThe series does maintain its serious tone on occasions though. Most of this comes with Fino\u2019s road of helping out at the store. Her intentions are genuine and she really wants to learn more about her job. The series captures her moments of discovery as she learns more about ideas in the human world. These include tasks such as simple greetings while working at the front counter. Not to mention the fact that Fino has the mind of a child, she often make mistakes but strives to learn from them. In one particular episode, she puts all her effort in order to impress Raul and everyone.\\n\\n\r\nFor the story itself, it shifts between fantasy and reality on various occasions. The story picks up later on as we find out some startling revelations. The past comes back like a dagger with its sharp edge pointing at Raul. In various ways, the series doesn\u2019t entirely neglect itself without the initial set up from the beginning. The problem is the execution being slow paced and utterly sudden.\\n\\n\r\nAbsurd is also an underrated word to be used to describe this show. For whatever reason, Nova often lets others take advantage of her such as the dirty old man that comes to visit on occasions. Additionally, humans also sees demons as vile evil but Raul treats Fino with care. It\u2019s peculiar the sense that Raul was defeated by a demon lord and stuck in the situation he is now. Yet, he never plots for revenge directly or take out his frustrations towards Fino. (well only when she ends up scaring away the customers) Surprisingly enough also, Raul never takes advantages of the compromising positions he gets himself into. In a way, he is more tolerable than the typical male harem although he isn\u2019t immune to nosebleeds or lewd thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of comedy, the show honestly tries a bit too hard with repetitive clich\u00e9s that we see often in harem series. While the series negates the presentation of a beach episode, it still keeps its fan service dosage high with sexual innuendos. The way Fino wakes up every day in the morning, the tentacle monster, bunny girl outfit, and girls in bikinis advertising themselves are just a few examples. Most of the girls\u2019 outfits are designed with excessively short skirts where ladders are a showcase to their positions. If designs tries to hides some of the body parts, action scenes will shed them off. Speaking of action, the series does have maintain somewhat of consistency with the sword fighting, armor, and magic. Unfortunately, most of it is obscured by its strange comedy where it only occasionally shines when the plot is at its core. Wait, did I just say \u2018plot\u2019? An ecchi/fantasy series with a plot?! How remarkable. The romance itself is also blend and this is again thanks to Fino\u2019s absentmindedness. Her trivial mind cannot even comprehend the simple term of a \u2018girlfriend\u2019. On the other hand, Raul seems to have small inklings of feelings or at least lust for Fino in the forms for daydreams. The duo may have some chemistry but their relationship is senseless and incompatible. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation of this series is about as generic as it can get. The way the girls are designed along with their outfits is suggestive. Most of the women in this show also has absurdly big breasts that bounces in uniform. The OP song is highly innovative on this with no shame at all. Fino\u2019s character is also designed to look like an innocent girl because of her childish behavior. However, she is more like a molded character with a million dollar body but a 2 cent brain. In other cases, the backgrounds of the series is hardly noticeable. There\u2019s nothing extraordinary about the place our main characters work out or venture out throughout the series. Only the fantasy world occasionally has a few noticeable features to say the least. The animation studio Asread is in charge of the production with some odd similarities to their previous work, Shuffle. It\u2019s hard to take the animation style for granted with all the fan service plastered and in the end standing out with little substance. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack wise, the series mostly retains a lighthearted nature because of Fino\u2019s innocence. Some of the more intense action scenes does give off the feeling of how battles should feel like. But in most cases, there\u2019s little chance for praise because the soundtrack lacks a dynamic tone. Even during some of the more emotional scenes, the soundtrack is off balance. Fino\u2019s VA Azusa Todokoro is noticeable with her contagious laugh. (\u201cha, ha, ha\u201d) It\u2019s surprising she can portray her character so well in the case because her relative new experience in voice acting. On the other hand, Raul\u2019s VA Keisuke K\u014dmoto is unfavorably dull and often possessing a commanding tone. The OP song is like a rainbow of fan service of colors. I already mentioned this before but fan service will be something you can\u2019t avoid, at least not without diving into a wave of bouncing breasts.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to label this series as enjoyable because it\u2019s generic plot and characters. While it does try to characterize Fino\u2019s discovery and development on various occasions, the show doesn\u2019t redeem itself thanks to her own lack of common sense. There\u2019s little sense in this show either with its main plot or romance subplot. Surprisingly enough, Raul isn\u2019t a weak man and doesn\u2019t give into temptations like the typical harem protagonist. Unfortunately though, Raul is just the common working man with little sense of humor. The humor in this show itself also tries far too hard on various occasions fused with fan service, clich\u00e9s, and gags. In the end, it\u2019ll be up to you to enjoy this series or not. It\u2019s not aimed for a war between humans/demons or is one about how a human and demon can find love with each other. It\u2019s about working in the real world - a tale between a young man and a demon.\\n",

            "content": "Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore we Shibushibu Shuushoku wo Ketsui Shimashita (this is a mouthful!), or simply, Yusibu, is a rather...interesting addition to the demon king genre of anime.  I have not seen a more ridiculously long title as this since Noucome, so I thought that I would give it a try.  Here's my review.  (The review is 10% off if you're the first person to read it.)\r\nStory (7.43/10):  Have you ever played an RPG game before that involves you, the player, as a hero, questing and adventuring to go and defeat the dark evil of the realm?  (Games like: FinalFantasy, Legend of Zelda, Fire Emblem.)  After you finish the game, a game over appears after completing it, right?  And without a second thought, you go about your way, happy that you conquered the evil of that world.  But do you ever think about the afterthought of said world?  \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Yusibu is what could be considered as in my eyes, as a show that continues the story of the world, after it was saved.  Because the demon lord in Yusibu has been defeated valiantly by some unnamed person, all of the heroes-in-training, including our main protagonist Raul, are reluctantly disbanded and sent away, as there is no more evil for them to fight, and therefore, no need for heroes.  It is because of that, that Raul must work at a magic shop to sell magical goods such as a \"hair dryer\" and a \"refrigerator\" in order to take care of himself.  (btw, magic = electricity in this world).  It is then on, that a new person by the name of Fino comes in, wanting a job, meeting Raul, and the story goes on from there.  \\n\\n\r\nI won't lie.  This exposition really reeled me in.  The sheer ridiculousness that this beginning exposition had, was more than proof enough that I was going to enjoy this to some extent.  And, I was gladly rewarded.  The story itself isn't really that difficult to understand.  It mainly follows the lives of Raul and Fino, as the two of them live their lives, working at the equivalent of a small department store in our world.  As such with commercial market, and animes involving businesses, the general idea of bigger competition, new products, the payday, and breaktime are all featured in the episodes, giving a very supernatural slice of life feel to the series.  The pacing is rather steady the whole way through, and didn't feel rushed or anything.  \\n\\n\r\nAt the end though, the story threw me for a loop, as the whole series turned into your stereotypical \"female lead is in a situation that the male lead must save her from\" sort of bullcrap that exists throughout all of the anime world.  It did feel a bit different when watching it, and it was executed in an original and different way; but all in all, it was still the same thing, regardless.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't bad in any way, shape, or form, and it wasn't executed poorly either.  It was just a little bit cliched and generic with an interesting twist to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.43/10): The characters are an interesting mix.  Some are developed and explored to a large degree, and others are just there to appease the perverted crowd of the anime fanbase (you know who you are).  \\n\\n\r\nRaul Chaser.  True to his name, Raul chases his dreams, only to have them be brutally crushed before he could even start.  As the main protagonist, Raul gets a greater majority of development, as he begins the series as an ungrateful twat who can't appreciate what he has, to someone who's happy for what he's accomplish and/or done.  He's not a bad character per se, as he can kick ass when need be, as well as being an awesome guy with some common sense and little to no denseness, but he is still quite dull at times.\\n\\n\r\nFINO BLOODSTONE.  She needs to be in all caps because, she makes this show what it is.  Fino is the daughter of the late demon lord that inhibited the demon world.  A charismatic and enthusiastic girl who always tries her best and gets happy at the smallest of things.  She mainly occupies the role as being the show's major comic relief, as she can turn any situation or object into a depressing and sadistic one at the mention of about ten or so words.  Also, she's completely shameless, being, for the most part, ok for our main lead Raul to see her completely nude (A rare sight in anime, I find.)  Fino herself is the show's main focus, and it emphasizes that a lot, focusing the last couple episodes on her position as the demon lord's daughter, and throughout the series, building up her familiarity with the human world.  While she definitely is a bit much, the show heavily relies on her to carry the show along, which is a bit unfair considering that the side characters get jack.  (Other that Airi, who gets a minuscule amount.)\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is gigantic, consisting of about 95% of the cast.  All of them are associated with Raul in some way, either being a coworker or friend, adding into either the comedy aspect of the show, or the non-existent story aspect.  The ratio of men to women is about 2:7, so it's kind of obvious what you're in for when you're watching this show.  I'll get to that later.  Troupes include a proud loli, a tsundere with a bust complex, a kuudere, an overly happy person, the shy girl with the crush on the main lead, the coworker, and even a pervy old man.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Yusibu is a mix of well developed characters, and cardboard cutouts, creating a mix that works as well as it could've done for this show.  I wouldn't bank on this show being the most developed show ever. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound (7.02/10 and 7.00/10):  The art is good, for starters.  The palette used in this show is a more lighter tone, veering over to a whiter shade of coloring for this anime.  It is quite pleasing to the eye to look at, and the quality doesn't really dim down or anything.  The comedic scenes are also fun to look at, as they have your usual standard fare of simplified drawings for exaggerated expressions.  \\n\\n\r\nNow...the character designs.  There's a big, big reason that this show has been walled off by some people in the anime community  (Make that two big, big reasons.)  And that is, of course, the fanservice.  While the actual facial designs and looks of the anime are pretty well done, (except the awkward eyebrow colors that I see on the majority of the cast), the dimensions of said characters remains to be...determined.  5 out of the 7 female cast members are very big in the chest area, and as such, according to the laws of anime physics, each one of them individual breasts must move independently even due to the slightest movement of the body.  As an ecchi show, it's obvious that this should be standard fare.  But even so, they do go out of their way of glorifying it even further, and it just feels so weird to watch it.  Personally, I'm fine with some ecchi, but it was just a bit over the top for me.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was good, but forgettable.  The OP and ED were quite similar sounding, and sounded good, but they didn't stick in my head like other anime tracks, and they didn't seem that great to listen to.  Mood fillers are mood fillers.  No extra explanation needed.  Voice acting on the other hand was a slightly different story altogether.  Tadokoro Azusa does a fantastic job at being Fino, and I felt like it was worth mentioning because she does such a good representation of the character.  (Hope she gets more roles in the future.)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment (7.41/10):  Large breasts and other ecchi complaints, Yusibu was a rather interesting series to watch.  It was intriguing enough for me to start and finish all the way to the end, and gave me a somewhat satisfying feeling after finishing it.  The story was an interesting idea that was executed as well as it could've been, and the characters were one noted, but still fun to watch.  One thing to note, is the non-existent romance.  The possible romance in the series goes absolutely nowhere, and was rather pointless to begin with since all they did was blush every now and then, and gaze into each others eyes, making you want to reach into your screen going, \"KISS!  KISS!\"  I will admit that I throughly enjoyed it regardless.  By no means is this a required anime for people to watch, but it does provide some nice, time-killing entertainment with adequate comedy, occasional female molestation, and a cliched ending that was bought from the cliche store on overused ave.  Good for killing time, not good for if you want to watch something really good and meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.01/10\\n\\n\r\nHere's a review card to see how much you enjoyed our service.

            "content": "HA!HA!HA! Another very pathetic anime has finished, and quite frankly, it is the supposed Fino and Rau arc that I'm into it and not the whole anime, so I'm ain't gonna fuck around and just present my ratings for each of this anime's category.\r\nVery good 8.\r\nStory- Frankly it's very good enough for a 10 year old and below.....now,now it is the story that I'm referring to, we'll get to the fan-service later on, it is basically a typical twisted fairy tale about a group of wash-out warriors and enemies where the war between them is over and it is time to get back to basicliving kind of thing plot,that is interest enough and wholesome enough for a children's cartoon. There isn't any of the typical sexual innuendo ( for the most part, that is) that would be around in most of animes that has an ecchi genre.\\n\\n\r\nDreadful 2.\\n\\n\r\nArt - A lot of fanservices for the pierros to howl for, also, I kinda find it hard for the staff of Leon's magic shop to sport such attires that should be suited for someone working in a restaurant, I mean does this anime's illustrator,   Masaki Inuzumi this perverted to keep them in such attires where they look like a bunch of highschoolers working part-time in some fancy cosplay cafe? Well, if his point was to maintain that \"Moe\" thing then he could have put them in such outfits that is befitting of a typical department store clerk where the girls are wearing heels and min pencil cut skirts and not that high-school uniform thing while doing cooking class, the guys would be better off just wearing a shirt and tie.    \\n\\n\r\nGood 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound - I pretty much like Fino's evil laugh....HA!HA!HA! Also I like Sarah's cutsy voice as well as Elsa sweet voice. I also like the opening and the closing theme as well, Raul..........his voice sounded like some dork who can do anything right.\\n\\n\r\nDecent 4.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- At one point I kinda like Fino for being this good demon who wanted a simple life and has to undergo a lot of adjustment to fit it, but I kinda hate the fact that she is that naive about customer service and a bit clumsy. Raul on the other hand is a dichotomy, where at one point he still wanted to live in the past where the war between the human and demon exist and yet in another point he cares for Fino very much as a co worker, however he still plays a typical harem guy who is too dumb to be aware of his harems feelings. Sarah, I kinda like her positive thinking, but I hated her constant teasing of Raul with Fino. As for the rest of the cast, they did their part well, but not much a any flare since their roles were just too simplistic to say the least.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFair 6.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- In all fairness it was enjoyable enough to a certain degree, but not that much at all, since it was pretty obvious that studio Asread focuses on the fanservice than anything else. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPathetic 1.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- I would never understand what's going on in the mind of the writer Jun Sakyou as why did he gave this anime such title \" Y\u016bsha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Sh\u016bshoku o Ketsui Shimasta\" or I can't become a hero so I decided to get a job.\" Then again, this anime did live up to its title, but the problem is that to whom does this anime's title refer to, was some what of a \"DUH.\" Btw, even if the plot and story are very good, the fact is more emphasis was given on the fanservice and that's that. Adios. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

There is also something with the eye drawing that was kind of unique, in a not so good way.\r\nIMO, this isn't my cup of tea series. The female lead is the blockhead in this anime. I will commend the author though, its not a HIGHSCHOOL anime, but for a store. I haven't seen anime's other than this one that are primarily based in a store. Power to them.\r\nThe story is also very poor. Nothing is explained. Supposedly they were heroes inone age, but now they work in a hardware store? And one of the female heroes is also stalking the store? And a daughter of Demon Lord falls out of the sky. Idk, but its too much random for my taste.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, there is a good amount of ecchi moments.\\n\\n\r\nI can't recommend it because I didn't like it BUT if you like random anime non-sense, then I think you will like this one.",

            "content": "Yuushibu, the busty tale of a would-be-hero and would-be-demon-lord working at a magic shop.\r\nYuushibu maximizes attention on its busty character design, and attempt at a lukewarm story of how our would-be-hero and would-be-demon-lord mature into excellent employees.\r\nDoesn't sound too interesting, does it? That's because it really isn't.\r\nYuushibu takes place in a regular human world, where magic is used as some sort of energy supply. In this world, another world exists outside of it. This world is where heroes and the demon lord exist. Well, existed. As it appears, the demon lord was killed, leaving her daughter heir to the demon lord throne. However, since shedoes not want to fulfill her father's title, she leaves the seat of demon lord absent. Without a demon lord present, heroes have no use. Our would-be-hero is unable to become a hero because of the lack of demand, and is therefore thrust to reluctantly take a job at a magic shop. It is there he must train a grey-haired boy by the name of Fino Bloodstone, who is instantly revealed (and I mean REVEALED) to be a woman.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the story develops from that premise. The story has no clear initial plot, and does not emerge until the last couple of episodes. Viewers can enjoy a busty slice-of-life comedy for about 10 episodes, and then dive into a quickly tossed plot that ties events from the past together. In all honesty, the story was quite dull and uninteresting. It is the other elements of this anime that will keep viewers watching, but it is still no excuse for such an uneventful story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Yuushibu is a bit of an acquired taste. It's not as exquisitely drawn as other anime today, but it is by no means an eyesore. The bust physics are completely illogical, and the colouring is par at best. The animation is a tad choppy, and viewers will see abrupt jumps in frames. The character models, aside from one character, seem to be carbon copies of each other. Essentially every female is drawn with a well-endowed body; there is only one loli character. The lack of variety in an anime that uses these \"plot devices\" to lure in the male demographic acts more of a liability than an asset. Sometimes it is hard to differentiate between the female cast because they all look the same.\\n\\n\r\nYuushibu had a passable OP and ED. The OP, \"Extra Revolution\" by ZAQ, is upbeat, and ANNOYINGLY catchy; it may take a few listens to determine if it is a likeable track or not. The ED, \"Sticking Places\" by Sphere is a gentle yet energetic song. On a side note, the members of Sphere actually make frequent appearances in the anime. The members voice themselves, and their song often makes cameos in the anime through radios, concerts, etc.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voicing, the voice cast does a respectable job. The most notable performance was by Tadokoro Azusa, voice of Fino Bloodstone. Her laugh is quite memorable. She captured Fino's archetype well. The rest of the cast did an average job. No seiyuu will be winning an award for this performance, however.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Yuushibu were bland. Yuushibu did not successfully create interesting archetypes that made the anime more captivating. The male lead, Raul Chaser, is portrayed as a responsible yet cowardly man in the face of fanservice. In other words, he is your typical faceless MC-kun in harems. Of course, very few watch harems for the males anyways. The females show their archetypes rather quickly, but almost none of them are engaging. Fino Bloodstone is an energetic, naive busty girl. She starts out from not knowing any culture differences; she often makes decisions based on her life back in the demon world, like assuming every customer is fond of blood. Her naive mind also causes her to be utterly confused and ask Raul Chaser where does the store sell money. Aside from Fino, viewers have a mild array of female choices. They aren't bad, but there is close to nothing going for them that will make them memorable characters.\\n\\n\r\nYuushibu is best enjoyed as an ecchi comedy. The drama, romance, story-telling, and cast development are all so poor that it's a pity to see Yuushibu even attempting it. The more serious dialogue is corny, predictable, and lackluster. However, the comedic dialogue was at times pretty well-written.\\n\\n\r\nYuushibu is by no means a must-watch anime. The story is awful, the dialogue sounds like it came from a novice author. Of course, these elements are not the main meat of what is to be critiqued. It's the fanservice, the voice cast, and the comedy that must be analyzed. The fanservice does not appeal to a wide audience because the majority of the female cast have the same body. The voice cast for the most part does an excellent job. The comedy does a fine job when it can.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Yuushibu is best described as a bust*. \\n\\n\\n\r\n*no pun intended",

The characters were funny and the harem concept was not overdone or annoying. \r\nIf you love Fino(or Phino) and Raul you ll love the show. It seemed that only 2 characters were truly given importance in this show and the rest were in supporting roles though they had hints of such potential.\r\nThe idea is similar to Devil is a part timer(which is amazing) but I wouldrecommend this series if you can ignore the lewdness(you wont regret it as long as you Dont think/analyze it too much)",

Over-all its actually an enjoyable watch if you can handle fan service. (Spoiler Free)\r\nStory - The story was not so original because Hataraku Maou-sama! already pulled off something like this. But, with the fan service and the way the setting was set gave a new spin on it. What I really wished for most was the story to elaborate a bit more on the pasts of Raul and Fino.\r\nArt - I was a bit skepticalat first, but then it really grew on me. Colorful and really cool at certain points. Very bouncy and raunchy at times though! \\n\\n\r\nSound - Some of the music was actually very catchy, like the violin in some of the fighting scenes. I very much enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Fino reminded me of Nyarko. Very weird and very revealing. Every character had their own personality which added a bit. Not to mention finding out some of a hidden past with a few of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - It was a fun and filling watch. If you have seen many, many, many anime... It may not be original but its definitely at the least a great time waster.\\n\\n\r\nSomething worth watching this year if you have run out of shows!\\n\\n",

With that being said, it is also by no means without its merits. Yuushibu is fine; in fact, in places it\u2019s even good. It plays to the strengths of its premise just enough to be considered fun, and that\u2019s ok\u2014allow me to explain why:\r\nThe story of Yuushibu follows Raul Chaser: a would-be hero, if not for the fact that the Demon Lord has already been defeated. With his dreams crushed, and him in need of finding a way to make ends meet,Raul finds himself working for a magic shop, which is humorously setup to parody that of a modern day, Japanese electronics store.\\n\\n\r\nIt is at this point that many people may draw a comparison with Hataraku Maou-sama! and that is certainly not unfounded; however, to suggest that Yuushibu is an imitation of Hataraku Maou-sama! is not giving credit where credit is due. Where Hataraku Maou-sama! poses the question: \u2018what would happen if the Demon Lord showed up in modern day Japan?\u2019, Yuushibu instead asks: \u2018what would happen to a world where the Demon Lord no longer exists?\u2019 They both deconstruct and poke fun at a well-established genre in opposite ways, which is truly a strength of both shows.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Yuushibu ultimately falls short of Hataraku Maou-sama! is unfortunately in how it answers its own question. Yuushibu introduces its heroine, Fino Bloodstone, and from that point on, the majority of the show becomes the Raul and Fino show. That is not to say that this is a bad thing; their interactions are fun and make for easy watching, but it does mean that a lot of characters get sidetracked and used as mere plot devices.\\n\\n\r\nThe show definitely picks up its momentum going into its final arc, questioning the idea of what makes a hero and what makes a villain; but once again, it\u2019s the questions it poses that are more interesting than what actually comes across.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the show\u2019s art is arguably where we can find another strength. Sure, with the exception of Fino and a few other characters, the character designs are mostly bland. This goes for the backgrounds too, which whilst being colourful, aren't really anything special. What makes this show's art a strength, dare I say it, is the way it handles its fan service and ecchiness. I hazard to use the word tasteful, but Yuushibu\u2019s fan service never felt overused or too obscene. It was never the \u2018plot\u2019, if you get what I mean, so I felt it complimented the show more than it harmed it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound on the other hand certainly wasn\u2019t anything to write home about. Not that it detracted from my enjoyment of the show, but it never went beyond what I expected. The same goes for the voice actors too. No one character\u2019s voice stood out as great or annoying\u2014they were all just fine.\\n\\n\r\nSo to wrap things up, is Yuushibu worth watching? Yes, even if it\u2019s just the once. At times, Yuushibu can feel like it's squandering its storytelling potential; but nevertheless, it offers up enough light romance, enough action, and enough fan service to justify the watch. Oh, and that's not even mentioning the Captain Picard cameos throughout!",

I feel like it could have been improved if they stretched the series out more. Despite a few quirks, Fino came off as too sweet for a Demon Lord's daughter and Raul warmed up to her too quickly. I enjoyed the first 3 episodes, tolerated episodes 4-10 (a large serving of slice of life), and pretty much enjoyed 11 and 12. If you liked episode 1, you'll probably like the ending scenes. Personally, my favorite part was seeing Raul interact with hisformer Yuusha friends and then let off a mad laugh in episode 11. Fino can also be fun at times. She's naturally sweet and smiles, but when Raul tells her to smile at customers, she does and starts uncontrollably letting off an \"evil demon\" air. At those times, it's Raul' s face that's the funniest. As far as ecchi goes, it's pretty mild: though there is heavy showing of bare breast and Fino being naked. Episodes 2-3 are pretty much that. If you liked The Devil Is A Part Timer, I'd recommend this. Another thing is that there is almost zero lip to lip contact. That was refreshing. Hope this was helpful. In my mind, Raul was the best character. The others seemed almost typical.",

Then great, because this anime is perfect for you! The women are all dense, because how else would an \"ecchi\" work? Good for you though, because you already can\u2019t handle strong women. They\u2019re also one dimensional characters, because of course, all introspection has to be done by our beloved hero. \r\nSpeaking of whom, Raul is an absolute darling and a complete gentleman (not being sarcastic). After all, he did aspire to be a hero! He was the saving grace ofthe anime. Wish we had more men like him in the real world instead of, you know, the pervs enjoying the \u201cfan service\u201d in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nComparisons with Hatarakou Maou Sama (The Devil is a Part Timer) were to be expected, but apart from the devil and hero being forced to work together in the human world to survive, both anime have different story-lines which were treated very differently. I rated Hatarakou a LOT more, simply because it didn\u2019t have to stoop low enough to objectify already sexualized women. It also had a plot and great characters, something which this anime lacks. Yuushi ni could have been decent, but alas, its fan servicing took whatever little good grace it had left in the eyes of viewers.\\n\\n\r\nSome points I have to make>\\n\r\n# Raul-Phino appeared to share a more of brother-sister relationship. The romance seemed obviously forced.\\n\r\n# Why the FUK does a Star Wars-ish music start playing as soon as the creepy old man makes an appearance?  Randomist shit I've seen in an anime\\n\r\n# Why did the skins of all girls appear as if they were shrink wrapped in plastic? And those pink spots\\n\r\non their skin to highlight a \"rosy\" tint (shoulders, breasts and legs) always appeared as more of a rash. Ugh.\\n\r\n# Why such a long title? I will now have to google it every time before doing any research on Google. Yes, I get the irony. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPS. For those of you jerks enjoying the nipples of Phino, know that she isn\u2019t more than 14-15 at best (argue all you want). \\n",

I have got to say, I don't remember much from this anime (since I watched it quite a while back), but I don't remember crap about the main character. I feel like in order to have a good show, the main character hasgot to be at least memorable. I do remember the love interest however: she had a good design and was a well rounded character; but, those last few episodes, they just pissed me off. Why? Why the heck did they decide part-way through that it actually needed a story. The magic system already sucked, the MC sucked, the gross CG sucked: it could of at least been reserved as a stupid, but funny slice-of-life. But no, they just had to try to put a story on this thing. It's like trying to clothe Beelzebub, it's just not going to work. All in all, it deserved a 3, more like a high 2.

            "content": "Yuushibu is an Ecchi/Comedy anime with some minor action and romance type aspects. While the premise is similar to The Devil is a Part Timer, the focus of the shows are not.\r\nThe story is simple. Raul Chaser is working at a magic items store (instead of electricity things are run by magic) but his real dream is to be a hero. However, because the demon lord was defeated there is no need for them anymore. One day a \"guy\" walks into the store and applies... this \"guy\" happens to be the demon lords kid. Okay, the \"guy\" is really a girl named Fino, the demonlords daughter.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing this anime does very well is executing the premise. Each episode the characters (mostly Fino) learns something about her job or life outside the demon realm in general. At the same time... it kind of reflects like real life situations and such. It even had this whole thing about the big department store out pricing the small local shops by literally working small demons to death. I want to say that I really like the world they built in the anime. I thought using normal household appliances and having them powered by magic in this fantasy world was a great idea.\\n\\n\r\nYes a big aspect of the show is fan-service and honestly in the first episode it's not that well placed. However, I don't think people should mind that much after that episode. There is a lot of fan-service but eventually it's almost completely becomes integrated into the story/situations rather than just being there for the sake of having it (okay I totally realize the situations are set up for fan service but come on)\\n\\n\r\nThe main pair in Raul and Fino make a great team. Fino starts out very naive (and mainly stays that way) but she does learn concepts at a regular basis. Not only this but she actually has actual insight into some concepts which automatically makes her smarter than 99% of anime females. While Raul's character and the way he progresses is rather predictable but he changes gradually as Fino learns. He learns through teaching and experience and not through endless exposition.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had a complaint is that the show is too straight forward and cliche. It does everything it sets out to do very well, has likeable characters that get development over the entirety of the series, and does not faulter on sound or animation. However, the ending is essentially saving the day because of the power of LOVE and saving a floating pair of chesticles.",

He works in a magic item store, reluctantly of course, when a new girl appears with a resume in hand and wants to work at the same store. The new girl, named Fino, has a really interesting background, so interesting that it can change the course of the world!\r\n The story, for the most part is a very fun slice of life about working in aretail store when competition emerges, forcing everyone to work harder to make the store more known and popular. It's not until the last 3-4 episodes where a plot appears from quite literally no where and changes the direction of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n The girls, Fino, Elsa, Airi, Nova, Saera, Lore and Lamdimia are all really insanely cute and pretty. The art style, like many harems and anime that want to accentuate cuteness, use red blemish marks on the skin, typically around the thighs, breasts, cheeks, elbows shoulders, things of that nature; it works really well and it make all the girls so much cuter! ! !\\n\\n\r\n Fino, the main girl of the anime, is a totally adorable demon with a bright passion for wanting to succeed and to become something with her life; she's also has an incredibly infectious cheerful and peppy personality, making her a lot of fun to watch and care for. Raul, our main guy for I Could Become a Hero, is like most MC's in a harem based situation; he gets flustered when breasts are near him, he loses composure when a girl clings to him, but aside from that, he can be a cool guy, he'd obviously be a lot better if he made some magic happen.\\n\\n\r\n There are some minor characters that become a little important during the last 2-3 episodes of the anime, but I don't think I really enjoyed seeing the drastic and entirely different direction the anime went into. I guess in many ways, it makes sense and works, but I'd rather not have seen Fino get manipulated and toyed with.\\n\\n\r\n The music in I Couldn't Become a Hero, is surprisingly good. The OP and ED are quite amazing and will probably find the artist who did the songs, but the background music was good and so were the ambient based sounds, I didn't really expect that at all.\\n\\n\r\n Like I mentioned before, the art style is one that accentuates cuteness and is animated in such a way to make sure you notice the bouncing boobies and beautiful girls, a lot of good.\\n\\n\r\n I Couldn't Become a Hero is really a show for people looking for a lot of ecchi. We have pantsu shots, both the front and the back, we have beautiful bouncing breasts, we have nipples and amazing ass shots. The first couple episodes start off really strong on the fan service aspect too, even having a couple tentacle(hands) scenes that when explode, turn into a white mess....",

            "content": "Is it just me, or do the Japanese love giving their anime over-the-top, overly long, ridiculous titles. I Couldn't Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job is the story about a young man who went to an academy where people trained to defeat the Dark Lord. Unfortunately, the Dark Lord was defeated before he even graduated and the academy went under. Destitute and in need of money, Raul Chaser reluctantly gets a job working for a magic appliance retail store. Months later, another person also begins working there - the Dark Lord's only daughter, Fino Bloodstone. Can't you just smell therecipe for disaster here?\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those anime that I feel is underrated. Sure, it's not the best. In fact, most of it is downright cliched. However, I think this anime understands that it's a cliche and doesn't pretend to be something else. The humor, while seen in every ecchi anime series, is well-done and over-the-top. The ecchi is, well, ecchi. There's not much that can be said there. This is an anime that has plenty of boobs for young men who want fan service to enjoy. While I'm sometimes sketchy about ecchi, this anime is of the ecchi genre, so pandering to fan service actually works here - unlike some of the other anime I have watched.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is okay. Honestly, I've seen better, but I've seen worse as well. This is a middle-tier anime, where the animations aren't terrible, but not amazing to the point where you're thinking, \"wow! The animation is so flawless, and the frame rate is amazing!\" I will admit, though, that I do like the artwork. It's sort of standard, but it's still nice. The girls, in particular, are well designed. I suppose that's only natural, since this is an ecchi anime. No one's gonna want to watch an anime about boobs and nude scenes if the female's weren't hotter than sin.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this being an ecchi anime where most of the plot is, um, well, PLOT, this does have a somewhat interesting story. It also makes you wonder. What happens to the people who tried to become a hero but, due to unforeseen circumstances, never got the chance? This story deals with a new, intriguing aspect to heroism and Dark Lord slaying that I haven't seen before. Raul Chaser is a man who dreamed of defeating the Dark Lord and becoming a hero, yet now he's stuck working at a retail store because none of the vaunted, Dark Lord slaying abilities he has are useful in anything but, well, Dark Lord slaying. Now he has to deal with the fact that he's essentially wasted several years of his life learning how to become a hero in a world where heroes aren't needed. To make matters more interesting, one of his co-workers happens to be the daughter of the Dark Lord that he wanted to kill, which adds a new dynamic to the story.\\n\\n\r\nAside from Raul Chaser, Fino Bloodstone, and Ahri All-A, none of the characters are really touched upon. This isn't as bad as it sounds. Like I said. This is an ecchi anime. Literally. It's genre is ecchi. In an anime where the story is merely an excuse to deliver boob scenes to the audience, character development isn't that important. I was honestly surprised that these three actually received the development they had. Raul and Ahri deal with what it means to live in a world where their skills are no longer needed, and Fino is dealing with the fact that she's a demon, the daughter of the Dark Lord, living in a world that she doesn't understand. While the plot never gets very deep or complex, sticking with mostly comedy and slapstick humor, the way these aspects are pulled off is well-done.",

            "content": "Yusibu is a decent ecchi anime that has many fantasy elements. At its core, Yusibu relies on the formula of Beverly Hillbillies and takes a person from a faraway place with different customs and understandings and puts them in a modern setting where hilarity ensues. Make the modern setting a fantasy world where magic equals the technology you see in the real world and have the strange newcomer be the daughter of the demon lord, sprinkle in some ecchi for some added spice and you have yourself a show. That said, Yusibu is not a bad show, and I would even call it a greatshow at the beginning, but it does falter at the end so I must declare it just a good show.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are Raul Chaser and Fino Bloodstone. Raul Chaser is a man who dreamed of being a hero but that particular career field ended with the death of the demon lord, and Fino Bloodstone is the previously mentioned daughter of the demon lord that wants to live in the human world. Both these characters are employees in magical appliance store with Raul being the senior store employing showing Fino the ropes to her new job. The best part of the anime has to be the interaction between these two. Raul makes a wonderful straight man. He is established as a bad ass early on in the series who has the misfortune of working in retail. He handles himself in a much more reasonable manner than your typical ecchi male lead, though this does wear off as the series goes. Fino has an extremely energetic and optimistic attitude, but that doesn\u2019t really help her at all when it comes to working in retail. I do like how she isn\u2019t depicted as being stupid or clumsy, but as a fish out of water. It is nice to see her slowly get the hang of things as time goes on, but that makes it even more funnier when she makes hilarious mistakes because there still more to learn.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the anime mainly revolves around the business that Raul and Fino work at, whether that is trying to learn how to interact with customers or tying to think of way to drum up business because a big competitor has moved into town. While the story is not the greatest, it allowed for comedic situations so I never found myself bored while watching it. I was disappointed how the show takes a very simplistic look at economics and the nature of running a business, but it\u2019s really shame on me for expecting insightful discourse on the benefits and dangers of capitalism from an anime that contains a gratuitous amount of bouncing boobs in its OP. The ending was disappointing; there was really little buildup to the climax and there were multiple cases of deus ex machine. It would easily have been a great ended if the series used more foreshadowing and introduced the final antagonists sooner.\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn\u2019t anything in Yosibu that makes me believed it will be remembered years from now, but it is worthy for a look now and a quick laugh.",

Unfortunately, Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shuushoku wo Ketsui Shimashita. made me hate myself for holding that ideal.\r\nYuusha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shuushoku wo Ketsui Shimashita. (I Couldn't Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job.) is an anime produced by Asread and directed by Kinji Yoshimoto (Genshiken 2, Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai). It is the adaptation of the light novel series of the same name.\r\nWhile the premise may give hints of originality, the rest ofthe story does not present any whatsoever. Presenting almost no real story, the story focus on the day-to-day lives on the workers of the shop, which could have made an enjoyable slice-of-life, however, their lives fail to be compelling or even entertaining to watch, choosing to focus on ecchi. \\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I have no problems with ecchi if it doesn't become the main focus of a story. Hell, I enjoyed No Game No Life, and it was full of fanservice. Sadly, Yuushibu's is nothing more than a road between boob grabs and panty shots.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the end of the season, Yuushibu tried hard to create a more dramatic and even political plot , but couldn't manage to do so. It tried to make an internal conflict for Fino (the Demon Lord's daughter), but its effort only resulted in laughably predictable storyline that, as always, resulted in breasts being exposed.\\n\\n\r\nIncredibly, Fino was the most interesting character of the cast, with her quirky personality and lack of knowledge of the human world, even with her proness to nudity. The rest of the cast is hugely forgettable. Raul was a blank slate, with no real motivation for his desires. The other workers, all girls, with the exception of one guy, were only there for more panty shots and plot \\n\\n\r\nSaid all that, it made a genuine effort to create an interesting world. Actually, it was the aspect of the anime I enjoyed the most (that is to say, the only aspect I enjoyed). It was lovely seeing how magic was integrated with day-to-day life. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was unoriginal and missed the timing, most of the time. I can't remember laughing during any of the 12 episodes. It all felt too forced, with situations being created only to spawn jokes in a ridiculously obvious way.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty looking, but, looking at it with more care, it failed  to create its own style, particularly with the character design, which looked like rehashes of stuff that we see numerous times through the years. The animation of the few battle scenes was quite smooth, specially considering Yuushibu is, for the most part, a slice-of-life.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the visuals, the soundtrack was decent, but not above-average in any way. The same can be said about the voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nI, personally, hated almost every second of it. I am normally an easy laugher, but I didn't find any of the comedy even remotely funny; the story was uninteresting; the character development was basically non-existent, and I was not into the fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nI watchedYuushibu only because someone recommended it to me as a great slice-of-life with just one tiny bit of fanservice. I can't remember who did it, but I am never trusting that person again if I find him/her.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend it only for people looking for boobs and panties, as they will find a lot to enjoy. But I can't really recommend it to anyone else.\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave your (constructive) criticsm in my profile!",

            "content": "I Couldn\u2019t Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job.\r\nYep, that\u2019s the English name for the bullet train sized Japanese name of the anime I\u2019m reviewing right now right up there in the blog post title. Geez, what a mouthful.\r\nAfter waiting two whole years to hear some news on whether \u2018The Devil Is A Part-Timer\u2019 (highly recommended) would get a second season or not, I finally went crazy and decided to go on a hunt for similar anime. Luckily, it was pretty much just 5 second Google search and around 10 seconds of me reading the synopsis on MyAnimeList about this anime,which I\u2019ll call \u2018Yuu-ni\u2019, to come to the conclusion that I had hit the jackpot and would thoroughly enjoy the next 4 hours or so.\\n\\n\r\nThe very first thing I have to say about Yuu-ni is\u2026 TITS. Like, no. I mean, yes! Tits. Fully exposed jiggly wiggly bosoms dancing around on your screen hilariously 3 minutes into the first episode of this anime. I did not expect this to be an ecchi show. Well, not THAT ecchi. The Devil Is A Part-Timer had plenty of ecchi. But, most of it was rather contained and there weren\u2019t any fully bare breasts shaking up a fleshy storm almost every 4 minutes. So, be warned that if you can\u2019t stand fanservice then it\u2019s best that you just stop reading right here.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s get to actual meat of this review!\\n\\n\r\nRaul is a strong and uptight cherry-boy that couldn\u2019t become a Hero because the Demon Lord had his ass handed to him right before Raul\u2019s Hero qualification examination. The Demon Lord-less world meant that there was no need for Heroes anymore and so, many current and aspiring Heroes and the industries involved with this work, like armories and weapon blacksmiths, were devastated and had to look for another source of income. And that\u2019s why Raul is stuck reluctanly working in a magic shop. That is, until one day the Demon Lord\u2019s daughter takes up a job at Raul\u2019s shop and he\u2019s stuck showing her the ropes while his life, his dreams, and his way of working are all turned upside down with each passing day bringing them closer.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s the plot. Well, that\u2019s the plot until the last 3 episodes where a major twist messes things up and actual non-ecchi action (relatively speaking here) takes center stage. Up until the twist, Yuu-ni was probably a 5/10 in my view. When the show ended, the rating went up to an 8 in terms of enjoyment and a 7 when considering the show objectively.\\n\\n\r\nSince Yuu-ni isn\u2019t a show I\u2019ll ever recommend to anyone, I will discuss the twist and the ending and urge you to watch it if you\u2019re looking for a fun ecchi show that knows what it is, takes pride in itself, and does not half-ass the things it wants to do.\\n\\n\r\nThe twist is that Fino, the Demon Lord\u2019s daughter, is forced by some shady demon guy and a couple of Heroes to become the next Demon Lord. Fino ain\u2019t want none o\u2019 that shit. She justs want to be a normal salesperson and open up a magic shop in the demon world. So, a bunch of betrayals, fight scenes two or three levels below that of Fate\u2019s, and a load of wittiness later: Raul saves the day.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a pretty hectic end that ties up the starightforward story quite well. So where does the 6/10 from before the last few episodes come from? That would be the world-building, characters and the dry dramatic scenes. Let\u2019s talk about Yuu-ni\u2019s world first.\\n\\n\r\nIs it a game world? The characters talk about being drained of HP and use game terms so, is it? Are the human world and the demon world different dimensions or in the same one? There\u2019s a mountain that can either take you to or is the Demon Lord\u2019s lair in the human world so, what gives?  Why didn\u2019t the Heroes try to jobs as cops or join the military? Surely, there\u2019s crime and humans are morons so there must be conflict amongst humans as well so, why? SO MANY QUESTIONS. NO ANSWERS. At least the jokes are funny. Somewhat.\\n\\n\r\nThe dramatic scenes can get too dramatic. Like crying for a very \u2018why are the hell are you even crying?\u2019 reason is something I despise. Especially in comedies. Over-passionate speeches and edgy monologues are things I let slide in non-comedies but here it\u2019s a big \u2018NO!\u2019 from my side.\\n\\n\r\nAs in most comedies, it\u2019s a one-dimensional harem paradise ensemble of cute ladies and two guys. Add in three more guys by the ending because who else is better suited to play the villain to cuties than two frustrated men and a thousand years less inexperienced Orihara Izaya? Raul gets some development over the course of the show. Fino is jolly smiles and doesn\u2019t know the meaning of \u2018sexual restraint\u2019 until that twist. Other than for the fanservice, the rest of the cast is forgettable \u2013 well except for Searas, the boss of Raul\u2019s shop, who is a joy to watch especially in battle where she\u2019s selling goods from her shop. Real neat-o!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is the actual highlight of the show. I just wish it focussed more on the action scenes. It\u2019s still wonderfully fluid and suffers from no drops on quality, though. But it sometimes be too bright for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound\u2026 nothing special. Forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the score is a 5 out of 10. It was fun.",

I imagine it would be a lot better and that she could even openher own Leon store in the demon realm. I also imagine the MC being with her. It ending like it did didn't leave me satisfied. If it ended kind of like this then i may have even given this a 10 rating.\\n\\n\r\nI also wish the Armada store got into some type of trouble .\\n\\n\r\n~~SPOILERS OVER~~ \\n\\n\r\nOverall this was an awesome show with an adorably awesome girl MC and a pretty good paring for ships.",

            "content": "Shall we take a trip down the memory lane? The reason why I watch anime must have been started by watching Gundam Seed back in 2004, which I realized that anime is not just something similar to Scooby-Doo or Spongebob, but anime tells a story, unlike cartoons.\r\nWhy I watch anime since 2004 is not for the art, the OSTs, the mainstream-ness, the fanservice [okay I get there are those who get turned-on by 2D girls but still, reality-check], well, think of whatever positive notion or in worse cases, \"stigma\" of anime has, but I watch anime for the plot and characters.\r\nI always just shrug thosekind of anime which just centers on visual entertainment, I even drop mainstream anime because 10% of their story is for the plot, 90% of it are fillers which have mostly nothing to do with what the story is all about. Most especially, and as much, I always cut ecchi anime off my system [dropped \"To Love Ru\" and its cousins], but Yuusha ni Narenakatta~~ or simply \"Yuushibu\" here, I gave it a go after a brother [great friend] of mine watched it, who also likes Hataraku Maou-sama [and other wicked anime like SnK, Madoka, Kyousougiga, etc etc].\\n\\n\r\nAt first I watched Yuushibu because of its similarities to Hataraku, but I could go on to say that Yuushibu was able to go on par with Hataraku even without borrowing elements from the ecchi realm.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY = 8\\n\r\nOver and over have we came across demons and heroes, and again, similar to Hataraku's development where the main character lost somewhat his purpose, the similarity of Yuushibu against Hataraku ends here. The significance of Yuushibu sets it apart.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART = 7\\n\r\nI always don't get this \"art\" section, they animate, right? They should be good as that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 7\\n\r\nhaven't checked much on the seiyuu's, but they're a great cast, especially Azusa Tadokoro voicing the adorable Fino.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER = 10\\n\r\nYes, my favorite thing to point-out in MAL, the character section.\\n\r\nSo again, why am I watching anime, is because of the revolting story and characters.\\n\r\nKiddies and anime-fans and otakus who just watch anime because the bishie is there, or there's fanservice and pantsu showing, simply just watches anime because of those kind of secondary-factors.\\n\r\nPrimary factors always involve the plot and the character. That's the deep reason, man. You don't watch anime because you've seen pantsus, or because there's a cute bishoujo with big boobs on it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's with the plot? It's something about demons and heroes and a world almost the same as ours but with magic and the age of heroes ended.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's with the character, then?\\n\r\nThe good thing about the characterization of Yuushibu is simply not \"rip-offs\" of other ecchi anime. \\n\r\nThe main characters are dynamic, they have their conflicts from ep.1, and in the end of ep.12 [never mind the OVA, that's already the denouement] they were able to resolve it. What's good is it ties, or stitches with the plot. Yuushibu could stand alone with as it is \"character-drivern\" rather than plot-driven type of anime. How the characters resolved their conflicts in the end, that's as good as it gets. What's more, even if the story sets about demons and a fantasy-world, but their problems are \"contemporary\"---meaning we, people in this real-world, have the same kind of problems/ordeals they are having [job-related, lost, and other ordeals of their  that will flag the spoiler so I can't narrate it more here].\\n\r\nTBH, Yuushibu doesn't need to borrow ecchi-elements to stand-out; but because of the \"Hataraku Maou-sama\", then maybe they need the edge of ecchi to propel the series to recognition.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 9\\n\r\none of the very few ecchi [and at this point in time, I'll disregard this anime being ecchi, I don't have time for pantsu-ness and boobs-ness] anime that I enjoyed and didn't regret watching. This anime is totally worth the watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 8\\n\r\nAgain, like I said in my review of Stella Jogakuin, anime-fans and otaku are very hard to please.\\n\r\nSo this one here, being \"randomly labeled\" as ecchi just because of the eye-candy and some skin showing, doesn't mean it can simply be shoved alongside with the rest of the ecchi-genre. Yuushibu may not be one of a kind, but the fact that it made much importance of the aspects of the characters revolving in a world of demon-realm and fantasy, then Yuushibu may just be the only [ecchi] anime to do just that.",

Nothing outstanding but nothing bad either.\r\nSmall spoiler ahead!!\r\nCharacters have some stereotypes included for example the shop manager is by nature exactly the same as in Ika musume (nice all the time but when triggered powerful enough to destroy any foe). The character development is also there which is always a plus.\r\nEnjoyment suffers from too many bouncing/nudeboobs-scenes which kinda annoys the viewer.

            "content": "This.... this was just bad. \r\nBland, unimaginative, with uninspired characters.... imagine if someone took \"Wagnaria\" or \"Hataraki Maou-sama\" and took all the humor and life out of it. It is a very depressing anime about how some people gave up on their dreams, failed to find their place in life, landed at odd job in retail stores, and then spent 12 episodes convincing themselves that this is how the things should be. Well, at least that's the way this anime feels. It is SUPPOSED to be a comedy about ex-hero and Daughter of ex-maou (i.e. \"demon lord\") working together in a retail store. However, itis not very fun, characters are bland, the world is not very interesting, there's some very awkwardly done and disruptive attempts of fan-service (the anime really loves boobs, but has no clue how to properly include them into the story), and pretty much the only ray of hope in this depressing mess is main heroine - Fino. However, her positive qualities are not strong enough to make watching this anime a positive experience.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nVery bland, unconvincing, and fairly unimaginative. There were heroes that were training to defeat \"the demon lord\", but someone killed the demon lord first, so they end up working inr etail stores. The world does not really look like fantasy, and resembles modern day settings, with few minor modifications in it (magic being electricity, and cars being driven by monsters). There were downright cringeworthy moments involving interactions with other stores, plus, as I said, anime handles fanservice very awkwardly. The anime never loses an opportunity to focus on someone's breasts, butt or show a panty-shot, however, this looks out of place and does not fit the anime well.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe main heroine - Fino, resembles a character from Denpa onna to Seishun no Otoko. It almost looks like she is much more detailed that pretty much anyone else in the series and that her image is of higher quality. All the other characters are fairly low detailed, and backgrounds usually are nothing interesting. The anime uses some very obvious cg for some background objects, thankfully it is not used for characters, otherwise it would've been truly horrible. Basically, Fino is drawn well, but everything else - not so well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nDoesn't really stand out, and there's nothing to say. I liked how  Fino was voiced, though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nBad. All of them. Well, all of them except Fino. Fino looks fairly convincing - and works well as a naive daughter of demon lord who never knew manners of the human world (which also explains fairly well her lack of shame regarding being nude on more than one occasion). She's occasionally charming and even cute. Her visual design is fairly interesting too. However, everybody else acts in strange awkward fashion on every occasion, and their characters are unconvincing. I can't recall any trait that could describe any character aside from their looks or uniforms. Few characters obsess over their past of \"would be heroes\", but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIT was one of the worse animes I watched. Fino by herself was interesting, and I liked her character, but the world and the rest of the cast was so badly done, that Fino had no chance of saving the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI'd say skip it. It is not a good harem anime, not a good fanservice anime, not a good comedy, not a good adventure, overall it is quite bad. Fino is an interesting, cute and likeable character, but the rest of the show is quite awful, so Fino alone doesn't really justify watching this show. You might as well look up Fino's designs online, or search for screenshots of the movie.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the best idea is to skip it, unless you're really bored, or really like fino, or literally have nothing else to watch. On other hand... I saw worse animes than this.",

Watch \"Hataraku\" instead.\r\n[STORY - 6] - The protagonist is a hero who has reluctantly become a simple cashier at Reon's due to the lack of necessity for heroes which stems from the defeat of the demon lord. \r\nSurprisingly~, the demon lord's heir soon joins the Reon's team and must adapt to generic human life.\r\nRising action and the 'serious' tone begins at episode 8. \r\nI would give the story a 7 but I got extremely bored past episode 8 and had to deduct a point.\r\n[ART - 8] - Great animation, especially for being made in 2013.\\n\\n\r\nThere's lots of fanservice, if you're into it. \\n\\n\r\nI personally did not add nor deduct points for the fanservice, because its irrelevant to the score of 8 in terms of great animation.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTERS - 5] Nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nMain character is the typical 'clueless to romance' archetype prevalent in many anime. The side characters are nothing special, and just used as a means of fanserivce/ecchi.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT - 5] - I enjoyed it at the beginning but the anime slowly became shittier/boring. It was a chore to finish the series. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL - 5] - I'd honestly say to skip this anime and save yourself the time.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a fantasy 'fall-from-grace' romantic comedy, I'd recommend \"Hataraku\".\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: I did not factor in ecchi/fanservice to any portion of the rating. Even if I did, this was still a bad anime.",

When our anime begins he is in the final days of his Hero Training, and is one of the best in his class, but when someone else kills the Demon Lord, all of the Heroes, adventure supplystores, and Heroes-in-training lose their jobs. Now plunged into the regular world with little-to-no job experience outside of demon fighting, Raul is forced to get a job at a magical appliance store called Leon\u2019s. A while after Raul gets his job he meets the secondary character, Fino Bloodstone, the daughter of the Demon Lord that Raul had sworn to kill! Despite this pair having such an interesting dynamic, Yu-Sibu keeps up an \u201cadventure of the day\u201d sort of feel, with a few overarching plot lines such as keeping Leon\u2019s in business. Or at least, it did until the final few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a decent number of important characters in this anime, including our dynamic duo of Raul and Fino, the other employees of Leon\u2019s, as well as other friends from around town. However, due to the happy-go-lucky feel of this anime, the only other character that felt fully utilized was Airi Ortinet, Raul\u2019s close friend and rival from his hero days. Airi begins looking down on Raul\u2019s deciding to get a job, however once the two meet up again after the closing of the Hero program, they slowly start rebuilding their friendship and work ethic.\\n\\n\r\nYu-Sibu had some decent background music, with a few tracks really inspiring my sense of adventure. The ending didn\u2019t really have anything of note but the opening, oh the opening\u2026 It was a cutesy song with a very funny video. Nothing that I\u2019d put on my iPod, but nice all the same.\\n\\n\r\nIt did have a bit more fanservice than I\u2019d like, but not too much more than average for an anime of this genre/feel. In the end I\u2019m giving Y\u016bsha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Sh\u016bshoku o Ketsui Shimashita an 8/10 because it did have some genuinely funny (albeit occasionally crude) scenes, and I could honestly relate to and feel for Raul throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this review, please check out my anime review blog at trips-anime-review.tumblr.com",

Think of it, demon lords daughter comes to the human world, and the dad is, at least in this show, dead. From episode 1 I saw this coming, and was hoping I was wrong, and up till then, I thought I was. Up till the end of episode 8 I was thinking that maybe i was wrong and the cliche wasn't going to happen, but than it happened... than episode 9 came around, andI thought it could still go a different route... it doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, when they pull the cliche, they do it in an interesting way revealing a little at a time that its not just the obvious white and black, but manage to do a shade of grey approach.\\n\\n\r\nNow, episode 1-9 (before the ending) feel like I'm watching episodes of working but in a different setting, and with a story backbone, and if it was just those 9 episodes, I would rate this a 10... but the cliche does it in for me and made it much less enjoyable because I knew how  the last 3 episodes were going to go, with the last episode I knew the direction almost point by point. These episodes also feel so VERY rushed, where they just bomb the thing with plot that shows up like we should already know what is going on, which if you read the source material, you may very well get a better appreciation for it, but as I cant read japanese, and am fairly sure nothing substantial is in english, I cant confirm. \\n\\n\r\nTL:DR\\n\r\nIf you know what the cliche is just by me saying that, you may also not enjoy the last few episodes, or at the very least say they are the weakest part of the show. If you don't know what the cliche is by me saying cliche... than this very well could be a 10 out of 10 anime for you.",

            "content": "2nd review here so please be gentle. \r\nYuusha Ni Narenakat- Oh for the gods' sakes... What is with Japanese and in long anime title names????\r\nUnlike other reviews, I'm not gonna go over the characters and summary of the story because it's in the synopsis. Besides, I'm too lazy to type that out. Thanks Review Guidelines-san. \r\nAnyways, let's see first the story.\r\nStory: 3\r\nOh where to begin. Let's see. An interesting backdrop story featuring a guy trying to be a hero, but failed to do so due to sudden changing circumstances that is beyond his control? Check.  And thus having to settle for the lowest optionavailable as a store clerk? Check. He works with many busty and/or sexually appealing girls (and one dude...)? Check. A new girl arrives in town? Check. Boy meets girl? Check. The main character is a cherry boy (virgin)? Check. And he clearly acts like one? Double check. \\n\r\nThis is one of your stereotypical harem animes where it features a very boring and bland main character that was \"supposedly\" designed to represents the majority of the male audiences... Like every other boring and average MCs in existence... Oh wait. Forgot to mention, they are supposed to represent the majority of JAPANESE males. And it really shows in not only their manner and upbringing, but in their flaws, too. In both the characters and writing intended for the said demographics. This is one of those guilty pleasure animes that is not supposed to be taken seriously, like the anime adaptation of High school of the Dead. But even that anime has more story and things going on than this one that I'm reviewing. The story was more or less a promising adventure medieval fantasy backdrop at the beginning, but then it quickly turned into a more modernized setting where the guy works at a retail store. A store that supposedly existed in a medieval fantasy realm.... Reason? Japanese storytelling convenience. They don't even explain how they gotten to that point of civilization either. It was just there... FOR YEARS. So it just goes on as much slice of life and glorifying Japanese culture aka the work/retail culture and industry. Like any other Working (no pun intended) or job or career animes. But again with that medieval fantasy twist. But it serves no other function other than being able to touch the medieval fantasy fetish side in people and offer a demon lord's daughter as part of the *main moe fetish dish\". And it doesn't ever get serious until near the end, but even that was pointless since it was more like trying to advance the overarching story, even when there was barely any development on it, therefore made the rising development almost completely out of left field. \\n\r\nSo you ask me for the story rating?  Honestly I don't watch a whole lot of animes, but I can definitely this was one of the worst one so far. Don't come here looking for a story. It's just a fanservice anime through and through. One that sometimes flits around in trying to take itself seriously, while mostly not....\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nI don't see a whole lot of animes much lately so I can't properly rate it like one of those high end critics or even reviewers here who have tons of anime under their belt. But I can definitely say it was pretty solid, especially due to the fact that they don't rely on CG. Especially during the fight scenes. Instead they use more of the traditional cell shade animations. But that unforutanetly tends to show during fight scenes where the colors look off or bland due to the time constraints and demanding poses and scenes. But it was still solid. It was not Konosuba S2E1 launch bad.... \\n\r\nAs for the characters art, some of them looked very early 2k anime style coloring and lines, but it was not that bad. The stockings on the girls looked fantastic, but due to such, it often heavily contrasted that it sometimes catches TOO well. Oh and please don't look at their toes (swimsuit ep)....\\n\r\nAs for the fanservice aka the boobs. .....Unable to compute. Only found Phino's completely bare chests shown MANY times throughout the entire season. Airi only reveals the nipples on her pantyhose suit, otherwise the nipples are never to be seen. Only the general shape of her breasts. As for the other girls, they sadly don't get that much level of fanservice. AT ALL. Few are even exempt such as Lore. So if you were hoping for breast and nudity and fan-service diversity, the likes of which you could see in High School DxD? Sorry. You're all fresh out of luck on that one. You gonna have to settle for the main heroine, whether you like it or not. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nWhat can I say? It was pretty much stereotypical upbeat harem ecchi anime? Thus the music fitted to it as such esp in the OP and ED theme. Worse is when it gets all serious, but then the upbeat song comes into play.....\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nOh gods... Where to start on this one. Like any other harems, the MC is as exciting as a flattened nail on a 2x4... He may be a powerful hero candidate, but that's all his redeeming features. He has no other skills. He has nothing to offer other than being the \"straight man\" in many wacky situations. He may be diligent worker. But that's all he is. If you are looking for a useful character that can kick butt? Sorry, not until near the end of the season, and it's highly debatable if he's even useful or redeemable during or even after the fact. \\n\r\nThen for the main heroine.... Well she's one of those cheery happy-go-lucky main heroines? Welcome back to the 90s tropes. She's your titular go to character for any character development and fap material.... Because that's all she is. A bundle of fanservice served on a silver platter. She's almost the only one to let it all show. And the only one you will almost ever see. The other girls? They are all chopped liver, in terms of story, development, plot (of both kinds), and so on and so on. Them being potential love interests? Pft. Fat chance. This is one of those animes where it clearly pushes for the main ship MCxMH by beating it into your head with a stick. There's no room for anyone else. And with poor screentime and development for them, you almost won't care. Though I really cared about Airi. She had some potential here.... But another terrible that wastes away good potential characters in its own narrowsighted goal. And that goal is to promote and perpetuate the MH as the absolute perfect goddess and go-to waifu that she supposedly is. Everyone else is just a mere afterthought or slight intrigue, nothing more. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nThis was not enjoyable at all. Other than the awesome old man getting his kicks off of Nova or Airi displaying her own unique brand of fanservice in the beginning and near the end, there was nothing much to stay around for. The MC was utterly boring, the MH tends to grate on my nerves due to her constant trouble making, courtesy of her dubious upbringing and personality. And there's the fact that many of the *fights* are treated like a joke. Like the girls other than Phino, the fights were also a \"afterthought\" or probably made it with whatever left over budget they could squeeze for *fight scenes*. So if you were looking for DxD or any other fighting/adventure anime level of fights, nope. It left much to be desired. Especially not only how short and sudden they were but also because of strong and OP the MC and manager was... Seriously... Why was there even a fight with these strong entities?? It was almost completely one-sided. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nI did NOT enjoy the story or the whole progression. If it wanted to be a career slice of life anime? Then fine. Be one. If it wanted to be an adventure thriller anime like DxD or any other medieval fantasy animes (whether it has actual old medieval elements or modern elements), then also fine. Be one. But don't try to be both if you can't even execute it properly. It all fell flat in how it all integrated with each other since they don't explain how it all integrated with each other. Like it just... \"was\". No need to explain. Too complicated. Focus on story. Oh wait no story? Sorry forgot. Just focus on the tits please. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally for me, the only girl and waifu to take from all of this was Airi because she was almost the only sane girl in the entire group that wasn't a complete space case (Nova, the next door cashier), a cloud nine-walker (the manager), or loudspeakers (Ram, Phione). Although there was Lore who was the series' resident kuudere. But she gets very little screen-time other than to advance the story and plot. Otherwise she might as well not have existed. Because she didn't put on the bathing suit for the appropriate ep. She doesn't even strip at all or provide fanservice. She only gets naked for a bathhouse scene, and she still shows very little.... So honestly, the true takeaway from me that was a MH all shoved right into my face, was Airi, who honestly should've been the true MH due to how they made the ED credit animation and how she the first girl to show up when the show started. But alas, she gets pushed to the side for the \"new girl in town\".... So it was all a waste of time other than be able to rescue a poor character that was doomed to be neglected and adopt her and make her one of my waifus (Airi).\\n\\n\r\nIf you like that sort of thing or don't care for the \"articles\" (in other words you're here for the \"plot\"), then this anime is for you. Enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you are like me and have actual standards? Avoid this. Other than maybe seeing it for best girl Airi (completely subjective opinion)...",
