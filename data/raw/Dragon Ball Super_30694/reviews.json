            "content": "Look I think I understand what is wrong with the people giving bad reviews to this brilliant anime, they are being too..Kantian...let me explain.\r\nI am not a big anime fan in general, yet I grew up watching and reading Dragon Ball and let me tell you a secret I believe we all should keep in mind: the beauty of Dragon Ball is its diversity of registry, ranging between comedy, romance, horror, drama...and whatever else you may think of.\r\nEach character in Dragon Ball is endowed with affinity towards a specific element...BUT each character also has some room to expand and switch between his less dominant traits.Even Yajirob\u0113 had its dramatic moments, and Piccolo had its comedic ones. \\n\r\nThe same is true for the whole chapters, yes Dragon Ball Z has a more mature and dramatic tone than the original Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball GT is surely much more of a commercial product which targets younger audiences...BUT these are all generalizations and they can only grasp a portion of what each of the chapter actually amounts to.\\n\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super is a fresh, inspired look into Goku's world, offering beautiful artworks and some brilliant story-telling, the right combination of comedy relief and thundering action. The comic scenes with King Kai at the beginning are just the treat, Beerus and Whis turn out to be absolute comic geniuses on par with mythological Master Roshi in the original Dragon Ball or Old Kai in Dragon Ball Z. The battle sequences between Goku and Beerus in deep space are unprecedented and IMO they set a milestone for the whole saga in awesomeness.\\n\r\nI think that much a better work could and should have been done with the characters of Gohan, Chichi, Krilin, Goten, Trunks, Piccolo&Co, it seems that Beerus, Whis, Goku&Vegeta, Bulma got a first-class script while the rest of the family is stuck with clich\u00e9 and predictable/boring dialogue. \\n\r\nAbout Vegeta, I think he has the potential to become the most loved character in the series, he is smart, strong, has great timing in its lines and he is (almost) always at the right place at the right time story-wise. \\n\r\nI cannot but highly recommend this Dragon Ball Super who stole my heart and brought me back almost 20 years* and wish you to have as much fun as I had!\\n\\n\r\n*I hope Jaco is not reading me;)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Dragon Ball is and probably always will be my favorite series. I was just an four year old boy when I first had the pleasure of witnessing Dragon Ball on TV. Though I was perhaps too young to understand it, as I got older, I'd eventually move onto Dragon Ball Z. The more I'd aged, the more I grew to love Dragon Ball. I was hooked, and my knowledge of the series was immense. \r\nDragon Ball Super is the continuation and sequel of Dragon Ball Z. The story is quite similar to Z as we see our hero Goku progressively meeting stronger foes and thestakes becoming higher. New elements and characters are introduced such as the Gods. Something that Super has incorporated in this show that sets it apart from Z is character development. The series is also able to incorporate effective drama and genuinely hilarious comedy into its story, the most noteworthy being the action and pure fighting that is reminiscent of Dragon Ball Z.\\n\\n\r\nNow there are a few problems with it right at the start. The first two arcs were basically retelling the movies Battle of Gods and Resurrection F. While the animation can occasionally dip into the inexcusable category (I'm looking at you, episode 5 and over half of Golden Frieza arc), the show is never able to dissuade you from watching it due to the action and nostalgia. However, after those two arcs, the animation gets noticeably better. The OSTs and intros are also very nostalgic. But at the end of the day, it is just more Dragon Ball Z.  I think it is simply nostalgia surrounding the dragon ball franchise for me that makes you just can't help but want to watch it and enjoy it. I think we can all agree the writing is very bad but the action is absolutely amazing.\\n\\n\r\nIf you grew up with Dragon Ball or have watched Dragon Ball Z as a kid or early teens, then you will probably enjoy this series!",

            "content": "So, Dragon Ball Super. A series widely criticized and panned from the beginning, due to a multitude of things. Retelling the past 2 movies, poor animation quality, etc. But as you can see by my score, I actually really like this show! Is it perfect? No, just look at some of those first 27 episodes, and you can really see a struggle to get episodes out.\r\nThis isn't a review of episodes 28-89, it's a review from episode 1. I'll be reviewing each arc separately, before wrapping it all up with my overall thoughts.-Battle of Gods-\\n\r\nThe animation overall during this arc is, in my opinion..pretty good. It tries to imitate the cleaner art style of the movie, and I think it succeeds, for the most part. Minus the extreme mess that was the original airing of episode 5. The story is pretty much just a retelling of the movie, stretched out into 13/14 episodes. Some of the fight scenes are now longer, some filler scenes have been added, or new perspectives. It's pretty minor stuff, not a whole lot to change my mind about the movie. If you want the \"definitive\" Battle of Gods experience, I recommend watching the movie, but also watch some of the new scenes, and that last fight can be swapped out for the TV version.\\n\\n\r\n                  -Resurrection 'F'-\\n\r\nLook. I'm not the biggest fan of the original movie, and sadly this arc does little-to-nothing to improve upon the original material. Time restrictions and tight schedules led to poor animation, and it really shows in some of the later episodes. There's this odd addition of Captain Ginyu that just happens at one point, for around 5 minutes, but that's really all of note. I'd say skip this arc, just watch the movie. Or don't watch the movie, and read the manga. It's up to you.\\n\\n\r\n                  -Universe 6-\\n\r\nYes! The first real original content to come from Super...and it's a tournament arc. Okay, I know people like tournament arcs, whether it be My Hero Academia or Hunter x Hunter, and fans of the original Dragon Ball probably appreciate them doing a tournament arc. To me, however, that's one of the issues of this arc: it's just a tournament. There aren't really any stakes, no universe-destroying threat, it's a fight compilation. And while the fights are pretty good (Hit vs Goku for example), and the arc certainly sets up later stories as well as introducing some new and unique characters, there's not much else. If you just want some good fights, then yeah, I can recommend this arc. If you want a tournament with stakes..I'll save that for later.\\n\\n\r\n                  -Future Trunks/Goku Black-\\n\r\nAs a fan of Future Trunks, you can bet I was excited when I heard that he'd be in the \"newest arc of Dragon Ball Super\". Any excuse to give Eric Vale more work is fine with me. But then I saw an \"evil Goku\", and I was intrigued. Before I dig deep into this arc, a few things:\\n\r\n\u2022 Yes, the time travel did get convoluted at times, but I still enjoyed it\\n\r\n\u2022 Yes, the Potara retcon did annoy me at first, but I believe it will allow for more Vegito\\n\r\n\u2022 Yes, the ending was a little lackluster, but I enjoyed it\\n\\n\r\nNow, with that out the way, I can truly dig in. Goku Black is a great villain, with a great voice in both English (via Xenoverse 2) and Japanese. Seeing how the Kaioshin from Universe 10 differ from the ones of Universe 7 was also nice. I loved seeing Trunks as a broken man, fighting for what little was left of humanity in his timeline. The arc was full of great moments, like the Final Kamehameha, Super Saiyan Rage (or even Ros\u00e9), and the conversation between Future Trunks and kid Trunks. By far, my favorite arc of Super so far. I do not recommend skipping it, but I do recommend reading the manga in addition to watching the anime. The  differences between the two are interesting, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\n                  -Universe Survival-\\n\r\nLimit Break x Survivor is amazing. The subtle changes in the art style that were made are noticeable, and add a layer of beauty to the show. The fact that Goku sort of caused this arc by suggesting the tournament back in the Universe 6 arc shows to me that the writers remember previous arcs. Although we're still in the build-up to the actual tournament, I can clearly say why I think it's better than Super's other tournament arc. \\n\r\n\u2022 It has real stakes, the destruction of multiple universes\\n\r\n\u2022 Each member of our main team has had development\\n\r\n\u2022 Goku's attitude has turned against him, everyone is targeting him\\n\r\n\u2022 It feels like the story could go anywhere, while setting things up\\n\\n\r\n                  -Overall-\\n\r\nDespite a rocky start, and lackluster moments, Dragon Ball Super has - at least in my eyes, become an entertaining and fun show to watch every week, with an endless amount of possibilities for the story. While it still takes place in that 10 year gap between the end of the Buu saga and the last episode of Z, I wouldn't be surprised if it went past that final moment after the Universe Survival arc. In fact, I hope it does! See, I enjoy Super so much because of where it could go with its concepts. Gods, other universes, I'm really interested where the story goes next.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a Dragon Ball fan, or just want some good fights, I definitely recommend Super. If you were turned off by the early episodes and their animation, give it another chance, will ya?",

            "content": "Dragon Ball Super Review\r\nStory (6/10) Fair\r\nIf you are looking for a great story in Dragon Ball (past the pre-DBZ stuff) in 2018 you are doing it wrong. We all know Akira Toriyama is far from the best when it comes to this department so I never go in looking to have my mind blown by it. But in my opinion at least it never gets to the point where it's completely brain dead stupid that I feel like my intelligence is being directly insulted (like Fairy Tail for example yes shots fired but no one is defending that anime's story anyway). The anime started offgiving us the rehashed and in my opinion an overall inferior version of the Battle of Gods and Resurrection 'F', so many were quickly turned off during these two starting arcs and I don't blame them as it has some of the worse art style and animation the series had to offer regardless of the excuses or reasons of it looking the way they did, it should not have been released like that. A few changes like Ginyu making an appearance but nothing significant enough for anyone to say Toei did a better job the second time around with these to arcs in comparison to the movies. The Universe 6 Arc is when the series starts some new worth watching content as we get brand new characters. Although there were a few fights that were good like the Goku vs Hit fight majority of them fell short of what I and majority of the people I talked to after this arc was over expected. The story for this arc was decent and acceptable also especially with the ending introducing Zeno and revealing an even greater force to be reckoned with giving the series promise to where it would go next. The Future Trunks Arc after this was probably in my opinion the best arc in the entire series as it was the only time I personally felt the gave me the nostalgic feeling of actual threat to the characters and story. The execution in this arc I felt was quite good also even though there were a few short comings like the reveal of who Goku Black actually was and the who scheme behind it. Majority of this arc I felt keep it up with the standards that I remember back in the Z days. The final arc in the series The Universal Survival Arc was hyped up as it was hyped up to be a bigger and crazier version of the Universe 6 arc with it's one threat of the multiple universe at stake even though I was technically on a bigger scale of threat compared to the Future Trunks arc I guess since there was so many light heard and joky moments during this arc I never took it too massively serious. A ridiculous amount of build up to this arc, many many characters introduced and a shit ton of good fights. That's all good an all because coming into anything Dragon Ball like I said after Z that's all you are going to really get. Many many good fights happened in this arc definitely the best fights, animation and art style the series had showcased but from a story standpoint once again you shouldn't be expecting much especially from an arc that's basically just a giant Team Battle Royale which lasted basically over 1 year to conclude but 48 minutes in the show (how? idk). Although it didn't (at least to me) feel dragged out I do definitely have my issues with how some characters were handle but I'll mention more about that in the characters section. The Universal Survival Arc overall was a treat for the good fights we got out of it but I wouldn't call this the best arc just because it had the best fights I would give that to the Future Trunks arc. Either way you look at it all of the arcs presented in Super were fair at best and nothing to brag about to say the most. But like I'll say one more time story isn't the reason we watch Dragon Ball as it's not abysmal we fans of Dragon Ball accept it for what it is. (Or should I speak for myself?)\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (7/10) Good (For the most part)\\n\r\nAt it's worst (4/10)\\n\r\nAt it's best (10/10)\\n\r\nMore Specifically (7.00/10 when you average both of those together)\\n\\n\r\nThe Beginning of Dragon Ball Super from an animation and art style standpoint I felt was it's biggest thing working against it. Coming out the gate looking look the hottest of garbage is the worst thing you can do for a first impressions for any series. Still to this day I felt it was a poor decision on Toei's part to let such a thing occur for those first few episodes should have been looking spotless, first impressions is extremely important and the result of what happened only proves this statement to be true as many many fans of Dragon Ball dropped it within the first 5 episodes when they saw such a pathetic excuse of art style and animation being showcased and still to this day have not returned to the series and I don't blame them. With all that being said just because the start of the anime was terrible doesn't mean it should be ignored as powerhouse animation directors like Yuya Takahashi and Naotoshi Shida eventually show up and blow everyone's heads off with their effort. Sadly even with their efforts the most the people who dropped the series will do is watch the clips of what they have done on Youtube say \"yeah that impressive but that crap at the start of the anime lost me and I can't invest the time to want to get to where ever the hell this is\". Good things come to those who wait sure but like I said earlier first impressions are everything now these days especially in anime. And with all that being said overall not taking the worst of the worst or the best of the best from an animation standpoint into more consideration that the other on a regular basis the anime's art style and animation wasn't anything to brag or complain about to be honest and if you take that into consideration if the worst of the worst is averaged in with the best of the best you get the score I came out with which is a solid 7. I personally think it's fair since the best of the best is some of the best I've seen in all of Dragon ball animation and I personally feel it outweighs the worst of the worst this anime has shown.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10) Great\\n\r\nMore Specifically (9.50/10) Great+\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for the anime I feel is the best part about it. From the openings to the countless endings, voice acting (JP VA), sound effects and background music I felt they were all great in every department in the sound category. They also did a great job and from the little that I've heard from the English Dub, it sounds like everything is great over there also with some extra flair to it's dialogue script.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10) Fair\\n\r\nMore Specifically (6.50/10) Fair+\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Dragon Ball were always something that was always endearing to me. But sadly over the time majority of the characters has failed to develop, impress or even stay relevant. The old saying in Dragon Ball Z (and even GT for that matter) days were \"if you aren't a Saiyan you ain't shit\". But now in the days of Dragon Ball Super it's basically \"if you ain't Goku you ain't shit\". Now we know the ultimate formula of layout of a Dragon Ball Z arcs for the most part goes bad guys show up Vegeta and maybe Piccolo get a fight, a win or two in until they get mopped then Goku shows up and takes it from there. Majority of the time this formula can be seen in all of the movies. When it came to Dragon Ball Super this formula never really is show cased. (And I'm not counting the first two arcs since both of those were movies originally titled with a Z in their names vs a Super). Even though we don't see this predictable by now formula in Super doesn't mean it's for the better or worse as changing from it only showcased it's pro and cons. One Pro is that since it isn't following that formula, it's hard to predict exactly will happen next, which is good to some degree. The cons show themselves a bit differently as each arc has it's new narrative content but from a story standpoint based on what the characters decided to do they have lead the story down such inconsistencies or disappointments that are shown though out each arc. Like I said I don't really care about high quality story telling when it comes to Dragon Ball and to tell high quality story telling in and story you must also have a high quality/well written characters to coincide the high quality story telling one can say they must go hand in hand. With that being said we all know characters in the Dragon Ball Universe aren't that impressive but we can agree that the characters are better and more interesting than the story they exist within right? (or am I alone on that statement also? anyway..). Either way I'm not going to break down the issues I have with every single character that I thought had an issue with new or old that Super has showcased as this section is already long enough for you to understand where I'm coming from. But what I will do is a quick run down ok?... and... Gohan is a disappointment, Vegeta is still and for ever will be behind Goku (but who isn't?) with Hit and Jiren being the new people pushing Goku farther sadly, Trunks was cool until he left, Hit was awesome until he gets whooped by the hyped up Jiren who's backstory is the most generic backstory I've seen in a hot minute and also get's nerfed 80% of the way thru the arc and ultimately disappoints. Champa was cool tho right? Everyone else isn't worth mentioning even in this short period of time I've given myself.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) Very Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.50/10) Very Good+\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of everything that bothered me with Dragon Ball Super for the 2-3 years that it aired, I was basically present every single week nonetheless excited to some degree for the next episode it next felt like a shore to watch for me. On top of the fact that there wasn't any manga to be ahead of the anime so more so than often not knowing what was going to occur felt like the good old days of Dragon Ball Z. Will I miss Dragon Ball Super? Yeah I can't lie and say that I wouldn't, I love Dragon Ball as a franchise and any complaining I do above is only because I want to see it do better and is the main reason I why continued to watch it through thick and thin and I don't regret it. The amount of enjoyment I got out of Dragon Ball Super every Saturday for the past 2-3 years far exceeds the amount of disappointment that came with it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) Good \\n\r\nMore Specifically (7.50/10) Good+\\n\\n\r\nWith Dragon Ball Super concluding at the time of this review the only thing Dragon Ball we have is the manga which is changing a decent amount of content and the movie later this year. Dragon Ball has shown that it can come back and still be relevant as a top anime at least from a popularity standpoint. I do think that after the movie we will indeed get some sort of sequel to Dragon Ball Super who knows Dragon Ball Ultra? Either way farewell Dragon Ball until we meet again!",

            "content": "SPOILERS duh...\r\nHard work always ran at the core of Dragon Ball Z's appeal.  Inspiring people to get into shape & persevere in the face of unspeakable odds.  Perhaps this is the most appropriate place to focus our critique.\r\nWhat is Dragon Ball Z?\r\nIt's impossible to speak for everyone when it comes to what message you take away from the show.  However I would like to make a case, that perhaps some of the backlash this series has received, can inform why people acted so negatively towards it (at least in comparison to DBZ).\r\n\"Goku never wins\"\r\nI can understand both sides of this argument.Lets first argue against this sentiment.\\n\\n\r\nBeerus: Beerus is not really a 'bad guy' he acts as a sign of whats to come for the story.  After obtaining a new transformation Goku ISN'T able to beat Beerus.  Which I find personally fascinating because that usually doesn't happen in the show.\\n\\n\r\nFrieza: Goku technically wins this fight, but is cheated out.  But in a certain perspective this was a good decision.  Goku's first battle against Frieza is ICONIC, but it only turned out that way because there was a entire arc of buildup.  Vegeta has progressed tremendously as a character and his battle with Frieza holds more weight.  However Goku does kill Frieza last minute, robbing the battle of a proper dramatic ending.\\n\\n\r\nHit: He plays a similar role to Beerus, but on a much smaller scale.\\n\\n\r\nZamasu: This was the most traditional Dragon Ball Z arc in the whole show.  But much like the Android Saga, it ends with Trunks victory.  Remember Gohan Vs Cell wasn't the end of that arc.  It was Trunks vs First Form Cell when he returned back home.  Goku killing Zamasu doesn't hold the same weight because it's not Goku's world thats in danger.  It's Trunks.\\n\\n\r\nJiren: Disappointing end boss.  Not much else to say. (AWESOME fight though)\\n\\n\r\nIt can easily be explained why certain decisions were made in the story, but the major complaint runs back to what I spoke about before.  Hard work.\\n\\n\r\nIn Dragon Ball Z, when Goku beat the final antagonist, it was a thematic representation of hard work.  That if you keep pushing yourself, you can surpass unspeakable odds.  But with the lack of final boss defeats in Dragon ball Super, that theme isn't as resonant.  Goku progresses but it never feels like his training meant anything if he still can't win in the end.\\n\\n\r\nFinal boss fights matter in DBZ, they act as that big moment that makes the whole experience worth watching.  But with no end goal for our heroes (not to mention people like Whis and the other angels still rank HIGH above the Z fighters) the whole workout is just draining.\\n\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super is not a BAD show, but I understand why people were upset.  I still really enjoyed myself despite this above average score, and I would recommend watching the last couple arcs after the movie re-caps.",

            "content": "hello Everyone! This is my first review here so I'll try my best on reviewing this show thus far through my viewing. \r\nThis will be quite a surprise for me to say this but I am actually enjoying this series more than I thought. I know right? Since its A first I need to come out and state why I'm enjoying it. You see it has been a LONG time since we heard there was going to be a new series for the Dragonball Franchise after all, It is a major household name in anime.\r\nI'd advise anyone who are thinking of watching Dragonball Super tohave at the very least watch the previous seasons Dragonball, Dragonball Z and Dragonball kai or just reading the manga otherwise you won't understand much of what is going on thus far if you have not so just thought I should let you know.\\n\\n\r\nNow this might sound weird and completely off to some people out there but I actually prefer this series more for its build up and its variety of content with each episode that feels like it is a genuine continuation, YES I know! So far its just a lesser quality rehash of the 2 movies of battle of gods and Revival of F but from a series standpoint its still at the same time its an interesting continuation of the manga of what its setting up for and I'll gladly say so even if others are put off by it.\\n\\n\r\nSo far in comparison to the first Dragonball, Z and GT whether you are considering comparing them or not, I feel that this gets in a nice stride of fun with that nice sense of comedy relief with its characters in its continuation which in foremost is great to see that it still retains that Akira Toriyama spirit in his depiction which is why I fell in love with the franchise in the first place and I'm glad they didn't decide to bring out some random black star dragonballs out of nowhere which was stupidly added in GT which I didn't like (though I did like his art design for some of the characters in GT) Problem was he wasn't handling the story especially when the story thought it was a good idea to turn Goku into a child throughout the whole ordeal which I found extremely pointless.\\n\\n\r\nSo I'm glad seeing that in this series so far, characters like Goku, Vegeta and many of the others made me feel like I'm watching a proper continuation FINALLY in terms of its setting and surroundings with these certain memorable moments that have happened in the arcs so far. \\n\\n\r\nBeerus definitely feels a little more antagonizing than he was in battle of gods which the show strides to show more and more as it goes along. seen as I watched the film I also noticed some differences with the story in comparison to the movie which is thankfully good in terms elaborating on certain key points in term flushes out more content that will seem to show other alternative points within each episodes that is coming out so far and that alone is evident and exciting also. \\n\\n\r\nFinally the art has had an UPGRADE!! about damn time despite the fact Toei Animation studios lack consistency now and then.\\n\r\nits nothing as dynamic and obviously won't be to that movie quality but it still feels very refreshing to see something not dated for dragonball in 2015 which is nice. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is brilliant too with good animations and hints to where the journey is bound to take the viewers along in their stride of the story with the showcase of new characters and the music is really good and doesn't feel repetitive at all. In fact I'm watching the episodes with the opening so far which goes to show how good the song is.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending if you have seen the previous series also has nice touching memories of nostalgia which the ending songs complements it nicely. \\n\\n\r\nMy real main issue of the show so far is that the story seems to get a bit too quirky and extensive at times which is my main gripe with this show mainly. but so far its getting into build up and also giving way for the fights that will take place in its simplistic approach at this very moment which feels easy for me to sit through and just enjoy the fun.\\n\\n\r\nNow do not go into this with high expectation just because its Dragonball, otherwise it won't be to your liking, after all its an 80s anime in its continuation of the modern day that still retains those very aspects of what made this franchise stand tall for so long now from back then, Of course its not for everyone If others are not willing to tolerate this show for what it is than do not bother anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAlso try thinking of watching this as just another fun, simple and yet silly shounen appetizer after the big main course, that being the previous seasons of the Dragonball franchise. So far I'm enjoying the moment.\\n\\n\r\nThere could be many new stuff to come along the way so who knows..\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading and have a great day wherever you are ;)",

            "content": "I'm here to give my review from an objective standpoint of a fan who has seen and read Toriyama's work.\r\nStory - 6\r\nIts pretty basic, the story is a continuation after the Majin Buu arc that takes place sometime after some time (Its not yet specific as to when in this series) \r\nhowever It doesn't mean its right at the end of Dragon ball Z like some people by accident think, but it does somewhat takes place in between the 2 since there was a 10 year time gap after the majin buu saga and before UuB is even introduce into the story. questionable I knowbut writer Akira Toriyama along with Toyotar\u014d who handles the manga adaptation for Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection \u2018F\u2019 anime and Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection \u2018F\u2019 Special One Shot. \\n\\n\r\nToyotar\u014d is also the official artist of the manga version of Dragon Ball Super and toriyama's staff can usually have certain weaknesses when it comes to consistency and handling such a big franchise then again it has those inconsistencies within the story towards whatever comes and goes in and outside the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nNow I can understand if the confusion for some people as well as fans, well that is if you were paying attention with the story of battle of gods which mostly aren't in some people's cases here and to point out with what the movie was showing was an indication from Toriyama's setting placing these films as parts of the dragon ball super series. \\n\r\nYES toriyama is putting the same storyline from the latest movies but that is not the entire focus of dragon ball Super neither is Frieza's Revival of F we get it everyone in the universe has seen it. \\n\\n\r\nYes it does include rehashing the 2 movies which is a bad drawback here in terms of fans expectation as well as the fact that these movies are still very recent and I get it, Its not acceptable for starting this new series off towards but I still liked to see them to do certain tweaks with its story in regards to the movies, But the main question I guess is Do they do it and does it make that much of a difference? \\n\\n\r\nThis is a mix bag while yes they have made a few certain alterations in some nice ways in the episodes but in terms if it really made that much of a difference? Than If I'm being honest it really at the same time doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't to say its a discouraging thing though, Instead this certain continuation in a way I believe hold these ideas as part of something big to happen for later on. \\n\\n\r\nIn the manga and interviews toriyama has referenced a new UNIVERSE 6 with there being 12 universes mentioned as part of it lore in that shares these 2 movies as part of a long series and I've seen some of the episode listing and its as how these reviewers try describing to you saying that ''OH CRAP THIS ENTIRE SERIES IS THE 2 MOVIES WITH FILLER'' (yes because the author is getting the members of the same staff from GT working on this who wasn't satisfied with GT wants to do another. WOW well done Einstein but your wrong as this is cannon so you can bow out.)\\n\\n\r\nSome have laughably mentioned that these 2 movies take up 100 episodes as most of the majority which is false considering the last point of battle of gods in super is actually within the 12 episodes after the first 2 episode. ''WHAT!? WHY DO I HAVE TO SEE THAT FOR 14 EPISODES?\\n\\n\r\nEasy answer, FOR THE NEW INTRODUCTION OF CONTENT THAT CONTINUES IN THE SERIES AND FURTHER ON DUH, The same goes for revival of F as they are also giving way for certain added features in the mean time on top of this long story, the real question is are you willing to tread far with what ever new content starts going into this series?? \\n\\n\r\nIf so, STOP BITCHING ABOUT THE FIRST 5 EPISODES BEING SHIT IF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY CARE WHERE THE STORY IS GOING,\\n\r\nIF SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ ANY FURTHER. After All I intend to give an objective review, which doesn't mean I'm praising it, let alone Bashing it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you do have a question that you need to address me with you can do so if you not sure on what I'm stating in my review.\\n\\n\r\nIf after the review you are feeling annoyed about my score you can just skip it if you think I'm just wasting Your time. Got it?.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing on, The story in its continuation has an interesting layout so far and I can say I like how the story is expanding on with its new content however there are a lot of inconsistencies so far which seems pretty obvious. \\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't trying to recapture a complete essence of nostalgia but mostly its trying to stay closer to toriyama's light hearted and comedic themes with its continuation in a proper manner where the time skip has happen after the events of majin buu onwards and this would be through the characters we know already of since the start such as Goku as well as the other characters old and new and even those that are strangely in between playing somewhat of a role into this.\\n\\n\r\nBeerus who is a major threat to goku and others recalls a dream to his assistant whis where he predicts that he will face against the super saiyan god. knowing that there is a connection to the saiyan race as well how beerus says about him ordering frieza to depose of the race as he did not like King vegeta now to me it diminishes frieza's character as a villain but can be argued that it makes beerus that more antagonizing and possibly a threat in a lot of ways.\\n\\n\r\nBy the 4th episode we see the supporting characters such as krillin, 18, Tien, yamcha and others play out in the very segment that happens in the movie but in a different location, that doesn't mean to say things change much because for the most part it still showcases a lot of slapstick sillyness which really at times isn't my fancy. \\n\\n\r\nAs goku trains, king kai is aware of the incoming threat that heads to his planet being beerus and whis as they head to confront the last remaining saiyans about the super saiyan god in the hopes of a duel. however these are just the beginning of these episodes. Where we really move from the movies we go into new territory that brings the fans more attention to what has been pretty much setting up for the story. which honestly is a long while but where you want to see new content and not the movies Episode 28 will be that point of interest for those interested.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7\\n\r\nNow despite the fact there really hasn't been too much progression with lots of these characters. For me to go through each of them for analysis is personally too long individually all at once though lets be honest,\\n\r\nYou wouldn't watch this series in the first place if you haven't seen the previous seasons or read the dragonball manga but lets get something straight here. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the very 1st episode, A time of peace has happened as usual from the theme that begins in most dragon ball settings during timeskips. \\n\\n\r\nGoku now alive at this point from the other world is pretty much unsatisfied with his earthly lifestyle which is funny since this is the real first significance in the series where goku is actually working as a family man along with goten, yes gohan and videl we know are easily together at this point as well being that its 6 months later after the events of the Buu arc. \\n\\n\r\nHercule is still regarded as the planet saviour from the public. feeling grateful he gives the prize money to goku and his family which I thought was fair since goku was the true warrior that save the world from the threat of buu.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there goku continues to train with King Kai, Meanwhile goku's rival vegeta is more in tune with his family despite feeling uncomfortable with living a regular family lifestyle with trunks and bulma. Vegeta has come to recognise from the time he fought buu he has changed to feeling more of a connection to his family as well as having the same smug exterior and also still even more determined to surpass goku.\\n\\n\r\nBeerus and Whis who we got to know from battle of gods are extremely powerful beings that are roaming across the galaxy as they see fit. \\n\r\nBeerus being the most chaotic of the 2 destroys multiple planets and civilisations whenever he is not in a good mood or doesn't like the food which at times will feel a lot more silly but at the same time enjoyable to watch for these 2 characters in terms of those comedic moments.\\n\\n\r\nBeerus for me, is the stand out character of the show so far. \\n\r\nI love BEERUS-SAMA!\\n\\n\r\nThe way the writers have build him up so far has been very good in terms of a new big threat within the overall world of the franchise and a unique individual among the cast in general which for me is a smart entertaining addition to the story so far.\\n\\n\r\nAgain there is a lot that could happen from now with the characters, that can change from here on so we'll see a lot more of the other characters in depth later on. \\n\\n\r\nThe real bad of this story has been a lot of its writing inconsistencies at along with its characterisation at times which has been a major gripe I've been having with the show so far. Though Its writing in the franchise in general hasn't really always shown those thoughtful consistency it still at the very least caters to trying to being entertaining in other ways that it conveys in its mood of the characters in general. \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't regard to being picky to a certain demographic nor does it try to steer away from its traditional fun that it places its content with the story since it knows its own entertaining aspects of its genre lies towards in and is for the most part very casual in its very approach in that sense. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - 6\\n\r\nI can agree with most of the reviewers here that episode 5 art was god awful which got a lot more strange with the thick outlines that was present throughout episode 4 which tells me that Toei Animations that have handled a lot of series with long amount of episodes will usually find it very tough to keep the work rate consistent which is a real shame since its been a long time that dragonball fans would get the chance to watch a new dragonball anime that has a difference in art and animation and its sad that early on as this. \\n\r\nThe first 3 episodes to me are still decent and not that bad at all And I feel unlike certain others that its dreadful throughout like a lot want you to believe. \\n\\n\r\nBut it also doesn't excuse A rich company like Toei Animation at times have this ongoing reputation of poor handling of art and animations in series such as One Piece, World Trigger, Digimon, Toriko, Sailor Moon, Yu-Gi-Oh along with SO many others that toei I feel are mainly damaging their own reputation because these are some major household names that they have the rights to the handling of the art and animation in the process. \\n\\n\r\nI simply cannot ignore that they are being quite disrespectful to the shows including most of all Dragonball Super and its fans in terms of their service. Dragonball as a franchise has been one of their biggest profits. I mean just look at how well Battle of Gods and Revival of F did here in the west. \\n\r\n(Which I know already some are mixed on it anyways)\\n\\n\r\nTo me its just odd for a studio that has had great earnings and yet are making this show with inconsistent art and animations in the way it has been for episodes 4 and 5, Though recently it has been handled carefully as of late.\\n\\n\r\nIts Easily not a favourable studio amongst the fans which is obvious, They seemed to have less acknowledgement in what they are doing which I don't believe that to be the characters or the writing what so ever but the animators and designers behind the way certain episodes are handled which is unfortunate and yet Toei have also been known to up the quality when it is needed like they did when they showed off the transformation of SSJ3 Goku but then they didn't keep up with its consistency which makes this section a mixed bag here. then again that possibly could alter or change sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nHell even creator toriyama, TORIYAMA!! of all people was unhappy with the state of its animation and came out about his feelings on it, so you know this is already an issue.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the Visual have started to make a much better improvement now and now I absolutely applaud them for that even at times the art might look a little wonky it is becoming a lot more handled with better care than that of episode 5 at this point.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nApart from some of the characters that sound off in their performance other voice actors such Ryo Horikawa as Vegeta, Kouichi Yamadera as Beerus and Tien, Tsuru Hiromi as Bulma, Morita Masakazu as Whis along with most of the cast sound fine as their respective characters however I don't like the voice actress for goku even though she is notably great in other roles, Jouji Yanami as King Kai I feel he should stick to being the narrator as his performance is showing a rather abysmal display, And I mean no disrespect when saying this.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is can be good at times but then other times it can also be a underwhelming which is lacks that overall feel to some certain scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThis goes without saying but I love The Dragonball Super's opening theme!!! \\n\r\nThe song is very easy on the ear to listen to and not so overblown out of proportion that it feels like another show entirely and It goes well with the art and animation. .\\n\\n\r\nGood morning America also has a nice light hearted beat for its ending as it serves to bring more of a simple and fun movement at its core. \\n\r\nSumitomo has done a few tracks in the series for specific scenes I like so far but not all his soundtracks really hit it out of the park in the way I would of liked it but that might be just down to my own personal taste I guess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nUnlike most of the hate and negative thoughtless reviews this show is ridiculously getting in the space of 5 episodes and so on. I have found the story while having the movies displaying within this series still to be quite reliable with its continuation as a natural viewer I've appreciate some of its episodes so far but its still got ways to carry on from here in terms of that necessary quality of recent animes of this present day and as a fan, It is still pretty exciting and enjoyable without the fact of me feeling that much neglect on what the previous series stood for in terms of its own brand of entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nI'd for one say foremost that this is a okay continuation after Z even if you disagree, Compared to other reviewers I do have great knowledge on this series and I can tell where it delivers so for those looking to write the most negative review about this show are only serving to make other feel negative where I have addressed this in a more constructive fairer manner than these other jokers that can't barely write a review let alone an insult that anyone probably would have heard so many times over by now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nI suggest sticking to the manga as well as the anime if you just want to see where toriyama is going at times with the story. And yes I know the manga is monthly and the anime is weekly which btw the anime is ahead at this moment of time.\\n\\n\r\nBut you still should check out the difference in between though the anime will at times will easily overtake the manga itself which can effect the state of any writers of A story that will have many fans constantly debating what they want all the time which will be at times a real big chore of trying satisfy those out there and toriyama has been known to have those inconsistencies a lot of times of trying to always keep trying to meet fans expectations despite this and other ambitions.\\n\\n\r\nNow and then I feel how passionate and fun the story wants to stay no matter how others will perceive it to be.\\n\\n\r\nIts also a driving force that we even got a new dragonball series and now viewers around at times even after getting a new series is just bitch and moan when something never goes there way which by the way we all can be guilty of this among any written fiction no matter what, so it shouldn't come as a surprise in the way people behave about this franchise (Not saying you can't be critical but at the same time should never over analyse to the point knowing what the series represents as to what it had always started out as a \\n\r\nsimple, fun, battle shonen in the first place) so deal with it. \\n\\n\r\nThe main thing is to have fun with the franchise in general, without going off the deep end of it.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan I've been able to watch the previous series prior to this one which I enjoy still especially since its art/animation was very much ahead of its time from long ago but if you still want to hear more negativity and very blind insights around you because of someones over analysis of it then go right ahead because I for one, don't have any shame of watching Dragon ball super so far and you shouldn't either, After all everyone has different taste as well as mine of just being a dragon ball fan and I'm proud of that.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing the Journey now. Later. \\n\r\nFeel free to ask me any questions about dragon ball super or \\n\r\nmy just review in general.",

If you exclude ANY of them, it will doens't change anything;\r\n-The anime tries tu use fanservice every singles time, but they doesn't make any sense. They grew up Trunks' hair only to show the \"Super Trunks\" transfomation with the exactly same design as before (when he actually had a long hair);\r\n-Goku and Vegeta are not heroes anymore. They've never protected the universe, never won a villain;\r\n-There's no tension, no senseof danger. Jokes are present all the time, even in the middle of the battles or DEATHS;\\n\\n\r\n-Trunks and Freeza's return is completely pointless. It just ruined the characters (since Trunks became a big crying baby, with 30+ years old but with the same appearance as 17 (again, non-sense fanservice));\\n\\n\r\n-The villains there's no motivation. They've tried to make something complex with Goku Black/Zamasu, but they abandoned it in the middle of the saga;\\n\\n\r\n-The powerscale went to hell. Nothing makes sense. Goku Black Pink form is strongest than Goku Blue, which is strongest than any other transformation, but Trunks ssj2 can still beat the enemy;\\n\\n\r\n-It's the only DB production which used the \"friendship power\" as a horrible deus ex-machina;\\n\\n\r\n-Goku became an idiot, he can't even recognize ki anymore. Vegeta dances for Bills and became a tsundere. Future Trunks became a crying babe, he doesn't know how to do anything by himself. Goten e Trunks are 14 years old, but they look younger than Z (with 7). Gohan became the weakest guy of the show, never won one battle;\\n\\n\r\n-The battles are fast, censored, you can't feel the punches, there's no impact;\\n\\n\r\n-The animation is horrible. I think only Berserk 2016 can be worse;\\n\\n\r\n-The direction is completely terrible. Nothing is in the right place. You can't even recognize if it's a serious scene or if it's a joke. The use of the BGMs is pathetc. The angles of the camera, very poor. There's no sense of storytelling. Nothing.",

            "content": "I know that since the start, many have given up on this series, But as for me I've enjoyed the start to this series so far as well as seeing characters we have known for so long now are back yet again. \r\nWould I say its as good as the previous seasons? Definitely not. \r\nbut I guess that will be subjective since it still hasn't gotten too far into this new story at the moment but it sure as HELL still beats Dragonball GT AKA GOKU TIME. Which as you guessed was the only purpose of that show was for Goku's character to have theentire spotlight and very little development unlike anybody else who hardly got any time to shine at all with there being no BEERUS, no WHIS, VADOS, HIT, JACO, or anything to show except for the badass SSJ4 Transformation which you don't see until the halfway point of GT. Apart from that, The entire thing was disappointing and forgettable which is why a lot of fans knew GT Sucked and why its only saving grace was its Art and its Japanese music score other than that everything else about it Lacked in execution Etc.\\n\r\nNow as for Dragonball Super, It is sort of a continuation and at the same it isn't which is really weird if I'm being honest. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem so far with this premise from the start is that its hard to know the exact time where this series sort of starts off from. All that is mentioned is that it begins shortly after the Majin Buu arc in Dragonball Z after the defeat of Kid Buu.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode starts with Goku working in the fields with his son Goten as hes finding his new lifestyle quite dull, he is than met by Hercule who gives him a large sum of money for saving the world from majin buu, thanks to hercule, goku can go ahead in continuing his usual training that he so obsesses over while goten and trunks go on their mini adventure in finding a gift for videl. Meanwhile Vegeta finally plays the role of being a proper father to Trunks and husband to Bulma though that doesn't last to long knowing what saiyans can be like at times. \\n\\n\r\nNow from this point I don't think I need to mention too much of the premise of the story so far since after the first 2 episodes it pretty much follows the story told in the movie of Battle of gods with added padding which will be a turn off to some viewers out there which I don't blame since I also expected something of a new start which Isn't to say its bad but it isn't good thing either in the way how many fans feel mislead. but as of now Its working very well and obviously its been a series that was bound to happen whether you like it or not isn't relevant because Its here now.\\n\\n\r\nSome parts of the anime feel slows and not really that inspiring what so ever and other times it feels like its rushing on too far ahead which for the series is something that needs to improve on now. \\n\r\nDragonball Super at times can be entertaining and can get viewers demanding more pretty quick depending how you can tolerate it. So for the most part its best to not go into this series with such a high expectation of this, Otherwise It will feel stressful to get through since I feel the author Toriyama and Toei Animation in general are still living in the past. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the manga the current co writer of dragonball super, Toyotaro who is the writer of the dragon ball super manga is sticking very close at hand to toriyama's style. That alone could prove to provide some good material but maybe not always to the extent that we, the viewers want. which is always going to be a really tough thing in terms of living up to what has been previously done before in the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nMy main concern with this series is how would this effect dragonball Z current ending where we left off from. after all we got to see new characters towards the end such as Uub, Pan, Bra, teen Goten and Trunks which would of been really cool if they were the new main characters of this series and If they were a lot more older like they were in the end of Z but even at this point on I'm not sure what Toriyama or Toei Animation is thinking besides GIVE ME MONEY or whatever.\\n\\n\r\nSo far in the story it has taken quite a familiar route in terms of what has been done but at least its more dragonball so I'm thankful on that note (again my opinion). \\n\r\nI appreciate that the animation is not dated like it was in the past and has been decent at some points but other times it looks Absolutely shameful in this day and age.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not great at all despite the fact the first couple of episodes were really good and that episode 5 was really bad up and till now it has been very inconsistent especially where it should matter and that is in its action scenes but they have been very mediocre so far.\\n\\n\r\nThe only great fight scene so far that has been done in all honesty to me was Goku Vs Beerus Godlike fight!! (Which most dragonball fights usually excel at) and yet since that there hasn't been many action scenes noteworthy which is a problem. at the same time the episodes are still watchable and I tend to enjoy some of the comedy, slice of life moments through the arcs now and then. Another thing that is great in this series is that you don't have see as much long segments of shouting and powerups like before, so keep that in mind.\\n\\n\r\nToei Animation as some may know unless you really are living under a rock have a bad reputation with having too many projects on their hands to deal with along with their pre-production of new workers and whoever thats in charge of handling of the episodes and its source material would stop making this franchise so inconsistent then it already is now.\\n\\n\r\nSo its no surprise on how they are going about this and considering how popular this franchise was before and still IS, \\n\r\nYou would think they would they would at least for the most part take the time to learn how to plan ahead of time and to animate their stuff properly regardless of their budget and working conditions to how they are finding it tough which to me is only excuse of demanding more business profit without even really taking to much care or consideration over the show or its fanbase. \\n\\n\r\nCan WE just for once have some thought put into this SHOW!!? \\n\r\nCome ON TOEI!! This is SERIOUS business here anyone of us could do a better job than what they are doing with Super so far And Plus SUPER?! Really thats the best title they could come up with? never mind the fact its connected to the whole lore of the Super Dragonballs itself.\\n\\n\r\nBesides my annoyance so far what I will say I'm enjoying the most so far in this are the characters such as their take on Beerus who is overwhelmingly powerful in this version and rightfully so being a God of destruction than he was in the movie and I do like seeing the other characters now but to be fair I would of like to expect more urgency put into the story like for example A great new Galactic Threat anyone? with such powerful characters appearing and being introduce there has been a real lack in terms of danger \\n\r\nIN This SHOW! Why!? \\n\\n\r\nTo be fair I know the chances of danger is there as it has been in the previous series despite the fact there dragonballs but now with powerful characters maintaining balance the problem is the danger is always going to be imminent to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nI can only hope that the new content also from here on in would be enough to suffice after 28 episodes in but if it isn't I will have to resort to putting my rating further down for this show.\\n\\n\r\nNow the Biggest Gripe I liked to mention in Dragonball Super, is its struggle to recall its glory days of the previous series. The plot takes fans on a roller coaster ride through less tension or urgency ever occurring which I will now touch upon. \\n\\n\r\nSo to start off, Each arcs has its own virtues and vices, and have slowly but steadily improved with some new content. Battle of The Gods saga can sum up as a frustrating comedic circus of characters that focuses more on family values and food than martial arts or self improvement. \\n\\n\r\nDragonball Super honestly might as well play out like a family comedy with few occasional action segments in between. The God of Destruction's goals seem to revolve around delicious meals rather than universal annihilation or ambition. Thus, dish after dish of Japanese cuisine is served throughout certain arcs, taking the place of questing for dragon balls and martial arts training. After an anti-climatic ending, the next saga jumps immediately into the action and then after that it just falls into real retarded stuff after.\\n\\n\r\nThough more action-packed, the Resurrection of F story arc relies heavily on nostalgia to make up for faults of the previous arc. The positive qualities of this arc can be found in flashbacks, A former villain returning in Frieza and fight sequences that look straight out of WWE! funny enough I prefer this over that crap any day of the week Imo, no offence to WWE Fans though Its still plagued by comedic distractions like Jaco the space patrolman and strawberry sundaes so what ever rows your boat I guess. \\n\r\nHowever Jaco is made for some real good moments for his character especially within Super.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the current Arc this multi-universal tournament is the series\u2019 first opportunity to show viewers what DBS is really all about. More new opponents are introduced to provide more combat, however the new characters appearance are just unappealing A lot of these new characters are simply just recycled character designs. \\n\\n\r\nThe fights shown are completely underwhelming and we that dragonball as a franchise excels in this really well but Toei Animation just Shits all over this making the characters mundane in their understanding and progression as well as making fans doubt a lot what they have seen from Dragonball and Dragonball Z Respectively which is sad to see. \\n\\n\r\nCatch all that? Yes, that is how its been so far in terms of its inconsistencies that it has shown In other words It has taken over 30 episodes of recycled scripts and filler, but at this point I cant really judge the entirety of this review until I see this arc and the rest of Dragonball Super play out. \\n\\n\r\nWe know from watching this far this series that it hasn't really tried to step up so far which I have no idea why but at the same time because we are in an entirely new arc we finally have gained some traction by shifting its focus back to the action, putting down the fork, leaving the wife and kids on the sidelines, and stepping back into the ring in the midst of fight.\\n\\n\r\nFor me they should of just let this series rest along with many other series I can think of out there. however I've always been in favourite of this franchise and like a lot of anime out there that isn't going to change.\\n\\n\r\nScore Rating\\n\\n\r\nStory thus far: 5\\n\r\nSound/Music: 5\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: IGN Rating 10/10. My rating: TOEI GO FUCK YOURSELVES!.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nOverall: Undecided but for me its a 5 which In case you don't know it means just Average.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend checking out the manga if your that desperate since its better handled than the anime. Do keep in mind however that the manga is monthly and is only just been overtaken by the anime at this point.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that Do not be in a rush to check this anime out at all just yet, not until everything of this show is said and done which will be a long time but either way take my advice.",

            "content": "Well, since I did a review on the horrible story that is One Piece, I decided that I might as well finish what I started, and get all of this off my chest, by doing a review on another Anime done by Toei Animation: Dragon Ball Super. \r\nThere is a famous quote that I would like to apply to Dragon Ball Super, which says \"Everything that has a beginning comes to an end.\" Toei Animation, of course, ignored this quote while selfishly looking at the money bags that would come to them from producing this shameless sequel to Dragon Ball Z. They did not onlyignore the quote, they made fun of it and said \"Do you underestimate the power of merchandising?\" \\n\\n\r\nListen, I like Dragon Ball Z, I LOVE Dragon Ball Z, it was my favorite show as a child by far. I realize that Dragon Ball Super is really not meant for me anymore, but I had watched it as a 15/16 year old at the time of it's airing (The first three arcs at least), and it honestly fell apart after a few arcs, and did not feel like Dragon Ball anymore. \\n\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super starts off with a recap of both the Beerus movie, Battle of Gods, and the Frieza Movie, Resurrection of F. It's a shame they had to recap Battle of Gods because it was honestly a really great movie. Episode 5 of this arc has been widely regarded as one of the worst pieces of animation ever put to Anime. You know, when you start out with one of the best Dragon Ball movies and you ruin it just because you are this greedy, then the sequel is eventually going to be bad. The arc then got better eventually, Beerus is honestly a great villain/anti hero, his introduction was done well, his character design is pleasing to look at, and I'd say he is easily in my top three villains in Dragon Ball due to how intimidating/fun he is. The fight between Goku and Beerus was really good, and I was surprised that it was this good considering how a number of weeks ago we had episode 5. This arc ended on a good note, and was good/great overall. \\n\\n\r\nI was thinking to myself \"Did Dragon Ball Super just have a great arc? Will this continue on? Will they better the animation? Will they have better character development? Will they get better villains?\" The short answer is no. Toei disappointed yet again in the following arc. Same old story, the animation in this arc was even worse. I genuinely could not believe, even as a 15 year old boy, that this was being broadcasted as an actual TV show. The animation during the Goku/Frieza fight is honestly an insult to all of Dragon Ball. The designs and the faces during the fight felt like they were being drawn by a child, not a professional animation studio. This is not to mention how Frieza jumped this high in power, horrible power scaling done to advance the plot. \\n\\n\r\nSince every one of Dragon Ball's arcs is condensed into a basic shonen formula, reviewing every single arc would be pointless, so let us look at Dragon Ball Super in a broader sense and discuss it's power scaling as a whole. I feel like the power scaling is what ruined all of Dragon Ball Super. \\n\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super's power scaling is just one big mess to be frank. Where do you start with it honestly? Dragon Ball Z did not always have the best power scaling. For example, you had the awfully inconsistent zenkai boosts during the Namek saga, something that Toriyama pulled right from his pocket and decided to just place it in there as a sudden explanation as to why Saiyans get stronger, and as a way for our heroes to always defeat the bad guys. Dragon Ball Super did not avoid this issue, they looked at the issue and asked \"How can we make this problem ten times worse than it already is?\" You have instances where even the hardcore Super fans cannot defend it. Instances such as Krillin fighting off against Super Saiyan Blue Goku. This fight was ridiculous, and you cannot honestly tell me that Goku was holding back, because if he was, he would have gradually transformed from his weakest form to his most powerful form. An excuse I hear about this is that Goku was trying to motivate Krillin into thinking he was doing well against him in his strongest form. Really? Did these people forget that Krillin knows that he is leagues below base level Goku? It was honestly just done to hype up the lame fight so that more viewers will watch, and to result in more controversy, therefore resulting in more publicity for the Anime. That is the only logical explanation. The fact that Goku started all out against Krillin, but not against Jiren is just ridiculous. The writers could have avoided all these problems by not having Goku turn into the eighth color of the rainbow against Krillin, with no explanation as to why. The writers dug themselves into this hole and should not be surprised at the negative backlash. \\n\\n\r\nIt does not just stop with Krillin. Every single member of the team that Goku assembled during the TOP arc just magically got stronger. All of these average characters, who were nothing one episode before the TOP arc started, just got magically stronger than the eighth color of the rainbow. These characters trained for a mere fraction of the time that Goku and Vegeta had been training for, and got this strong. It's honestly a joke, and Dragon Ball Super can't be taking itself seriously at this point.... but it actually is.... \\n\\n\r\nThe Zamasu arc is even worse than the preparation arc because Dragon Ball Super made even less sense than it usually does during this arc, and the asspulls were too much to handle. How can a guy like Trunks, who is infinitely weaker than Vegito/Zamazu, defeat Zamasu? Back in Dragon Ball Z, it took everyone on earth to  power up the spirit bomb to the point where it could kill Buu, but Trunks makes one that is a million times stronger with an abandoned city and a dead planet. Nobody can defend this terrible writing. I challenge any fan of this Anime to come and defend it. \\n\\n\r\nIt's irritating to look at, and see irrelevant characters suddenly become relevant again, and become as strong as two characters who have been sweating blood for years to get to the level that they are at right now. 17, the most irritating character in the whole Anime, Trunks (I already talked about him above, one of my favorite characters in Dragon Ball Z was handled very poorly here), Gohan, Frieza. All of these characters got magically stronger than Goku and Vegeta. Please don't even get me started on the sorry excuse of a character that is Kefla. Dragon Ball Z at least explained how the characters got stronger during it's run. \\n\\n\r\nOf course powerscaling is not the only problem that this Anime has. A lot of stuff that is counter-intuitive happens in Dragon Ball Super, retcons that don't make any sense. An example of this would be the potara earring fusion. The potara earring fusion was always known to be a permanent fusion, meaning that the two individuals who use the earrings and fuse together cannot defuse if they wanted to. Dragon Ball Super could have defused Vegito the same way it did with the Supreme Kai, by using the super dragon balls, but it just was not the case here with these lazy writers. After they fused, the Anime decided to disregard the last thirty years of Dragon Ball and just place a time limit on the potara fusion. The stupidest retcon anyone can think of, and it ruined the fusion dance for me, because what's the use of the fusion technique when the potara earrings can now diffuse? Other than this awful retcon, there were many unexplained things. What about Super Saiyan Rose, which was never explained? Why didn't Zamasu switch bodies with Jiren, who was leagues above Goku? These are just some examples in the endless sea of retcons, unexplained stuff and awful narrative decisions this Anime makes. \\n\\n\r\nI don't even want to talk about the Tournament of Power arc, which was by far the worst arc in all of Dragon Ball Super. The segments where they show the characters explaining everything that happens during the fights are the very definition of cringe. How are we supposed to be entertained or informed when the characters talk about the most obvious of things that are happening? The only thing the audience of Gods and Angels talks about is how much stronger a character has gotten, or how a character is beating another character and is winning, that's it. You would think that they would give explanations to things that need an explanation, since they were cramming this much dialogue into the show, but they don't. Why not just let the fight play out as it should be without interrupting it every ten seconds? Are you that cheap, Toei Animation? Are you really that greedy that you can't even do one fight properly? Yeah, I know that Goku vs Jiren was a thing, but that was towards the very end of that arc, when Toei had already made ten times what they were hoping for. If you are going to not explain all of the stuff you wrote, then you can at least not place the loads of pointless dialogue you placed during TOP. One or two good fights in an entire series of bad does not excuse all of this. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis Anime is an obvious disrespect to Dragon Ball Z, and it is a shameless cash grab done by Toei Animation so that they can make more money. This whole Anime was made to sell merchandise of the various forms that Goku and Vegeta obtain throughout all of it's run, it was not made to please the fans of the franchise. The feel of Dragon Ball is just gone here. Dragon Ball was great for it's time, it is still clearly memorable and the most popular Anime in the world, so a reboot was not necessary at all. But what do I know? Toei Animation owns the rights to the two most popular Anime on the planet, so clearly they are doing something right. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, if you haven't for some odd reason seen this, then I advise you to just not watch it. Go watch or rewatch Dragon Ball Kai if you want to see Dragon Ball. Or go watch some of the Dragon Ball Z or Super movies. Both are much better use of your time.",

            "content": "Dragonball super is among the worst animes I have ever seen. I strongly recommend you to not even start watching this crap. I honestly think that this show slowly ruins the reputation of Dragonball. In the following I will present you my reasons why I absoulte hate this show.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThe first two arcs of this anime are nothing else than retellings of the Battle of Gods and Fukatsu no F movies. If you have seen the movies the roughly first 30 episodes are completely pointless. On top of that they dragged the events out for the worse. Therefore the pacing in the first two arcsis just horrible. (1/10)\\n\r\nThe Universe 6 arc is a little bit better but still nothing special and complete trash in comparison to the Tournaments we had back in the Original Dragonball. It's obvious that the creators didn't put much thought in the designs of the Universe 6 participants. The fights are mostly uninteresting and lack tension. (3/10) \\n\r\nThe Black Goku arc started out promising at first but in the end it was just as bad as the previous arcs. Especially the ending is full of aspulls and it has one of the worst conclusion to an arc I have ever seen. (3/10)\\n\r\nAnother thing that really bothers me is that you really can't tell anymore how strong a character is, it all just makes no sense anymore. I know that DBZ to an extent especially in the Buu saga suffered from this problem as well, but in Super it's just gotten completely out of hand.\\n\r\nAll in all the story lacks tension and for the majority of it it's uninteresting and the writing is just horrible considering the amounts of asspuls throughout of it. Sure there were some episodes that were individually good but as a whole every arc was pretty bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really just pathetic. Just from that you can tell the creators don't give a fuck about this series. We live in 2017 and this trash is what they give us. Even compared to Dragonball and Dragonball Z it sucks bad and they were released more than 20 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special, pretty average. But still a huge step down from Db and Dbz which had amazing soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nHoneslty this is by far the worst aspect of the show. Every character has become a parody of themselves. Almost none of the characters acts the way they should. Videl has pretty much lost all of her character traits. In fact now in Super you could replace her with any standard anime girlfriend and it wouldn't even matter. Chichi bitches in every scene she is shown. With Gohan they exaggerated it with this whole \"Not a fighter\" trait.\\n\r\nBut by far the most damage has been done to Vegeta and especially to our main character Son Goku. Even though in the Buu saga Vegeta admitted that Goku is the Number 1, now he just behaves the way he did before. After the Buu saga Vegeta became friends with Goku and you could see he matured. It's like he just regressed as a character. Goku on the other hand has become a complete retard, infact even his kid self wasn't this much of an idiot. In Z you could see that Goku matured. Even though he loved fighting there were other things as well he cared for like the well being of his family and friends. He was selfish in Z as well but he was always aware of it and took responsibility when he fucked up. In super on the other hand they took his retarded and selfish side and leveled them up to new heights. He really just became a parody of himself and it hurts since they are slowly ruining a character I always loved.\\n\r\nCharacters like Gohan, Piccolo, Yamacha, Tenshinhan etc barely get any screen time anymore. To be honest the only characters I think they didn't ruin is Bulma and maybe Goten and kid Trunks.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nBecause of all these flaws this show has I could barely enjoy it. I will be honest some episodes in between will be enjoyable if you turn off your brain, but most of the time even this won't help. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before I recommend you to just avoid this terrible excuse of a show. Even Dragonball GT as bad as it was, is good compared to this shit. If it woudn't be for the name Dragonball in the title, it would never become as popular as it is today. The characters, the story, the art just everything about this anime sucks and it's clear that the only purpose of this show is to make some fast money because people will watch it anyway no matter how bad it is since it's Dragonball.  \\n",

            "content": "Dragon Ball Super, the sequel of the popular Dragon Ball Z, is a show with very polarising opinions. Some people love it and others hate it. I'm going to say it's pretty good and will give it a 7/10.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story of Dragon Ball Super isn't very complicated. There is a villain who shows up and Goku and his friends need to defeat him or there is a tournament going on and Goku and his friends must find a way to win it. The first 2 arcs are the movies Battle of Gods and Resurrection 'F' retold, the 3rd arc is a universal tournament, the4th arc is about a mysterious enemy in Future Trunks' timeline and the 5th arc is a battle royale with 8 universes. The stories are quite simple, but can offer a lot of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation of the show in the first 2 arcs is very inconsistent. Some moments it's very bad and worth around a 3/10 and sometimes (more often in the later arcs) it's very good and worth a 9/10. I would recommend skipping the first 2 arcs and watching the movies Battle of Gods and Resurrection 'F' instead, if you can't stand bad animation (the first 2 arcs are episode 1-27). The major fights in the 3rd, 4th and 5th arc are often very well animated and deserve a 8/10 or higher. That's why the art and animation is overall worth a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the show is overall pretty good and the show has some great music (often in the major battles). Overall the soundtrack deserves a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThe characters in Dragon Ball Super are pretty simple. There's Goku who likes to fight and wants to keep getting stronger, there's Vegeta who's fighting for his Saiyan pride and you've got some new characters like Whis and Beerus. The characters are overall pretty simple, but can still be very likeable. Overall they deserve a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall the show was very enjoyable for me. The major fights were very fun or exciting to watch. Even some of the filler episodes in the series were very fun to watch, because of certain character interactions or a pretty good subplot. It was enjoyable enough for me to wait every week for a new episode to air. Overall this deserves a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 (6,8/10)\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super had its ups and downs, like problems with the animation at the start (which were luckily fixed later on), but was overall a very enjoyable show. If you've previously watched Dragon Ball Z, I would recommend to watch this series as well (although you could watch the movies and start at episode 28, if you can't stand bad animation). Overall I think the anime deserves a 7/10.",

            "content": "I was hyped when I heard that there would be a new Dragon Ball movie back in 2013. The anticipation to get tickets to the showing of Battle of Gods was crazy and the movie did not disappoint. The fluid animation and mix of action and comedy that people were calling a Dragon Ball - Dragon Ball Z hybrid left a very nice impression. When they announced Resurrection F, the hype train carried over full capacity. And again, the movie left a very nice impression, albeit not as strong due to the weak ending, but that's a point for another discussion.\r\nI had been hoping thatthe success of these two movies would inspire a full anime series, and surprisingly enough, my hopes were indeed not misplaced. However, at the time I should have known better.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Dragon Ball Super, Toei's latest endeavor into further cementing why they are one of the worst studios of all time. Never in my life have I seen a more BLATANT cashgrab attempt than through this series. The first two arcs were just drawn out versions of the events that took place during the movies. Many believed that this would allow the plots of the two movies to be more fleshed out and pragmatic but they couldn't be more wrong. The pacing and animation were inconsistent and at times, god awful. The writing has been a weak point for this series post Dragon Ball so nothing new here in Super. The only redeeming qualities I found were the cast and the comedy, but you can only go so far with banter and antics in a partly action battle shounen, much less the sequel of Dragon Ball Z. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the next arc was quite interesting as it provided a solid extension and insight as to how exactly everything worked in the Dragon Ball universe and fleshed out many aspects that were introduced in the beginning of the series as they showcased this mini tournament between universes. Again however, this was hampered by Toei's signature inconsistent animating and poor pacing. Overall though, not so bad.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the good impressions as to the direction of this anime was heading was immediately smashed once the next arc started to pan out. The premise, at first, was very promising with the return of future Trunks, and the enemy this time being a little bit more than your typical DB monster/alien villain however things had started to go south very quickly. I found myself watching one empty episode after the last every week. Pointless fights, ridiculously inconsistent power scaling, a plot riddled with more holes than H&M jeans, and absolutely no direction in the directing. It was as if the animators weren't given a script at all and were just animating whatever they wanted and slapped it together. Suffice to say, I did not enjoy it at all. I was waiting for things to pick up but they never seemed to do so. This week's episode 67 was the final nail in the coffin. I can say with certainty that it was the worst conclusion to a story arc that I have ever seen out of any source of media or entertainment, anime or otherwise. It has thoroughly convinced me that this show has become a parody of itself. There is no other way I can simply fathom them putting out such an abomination into the world with their names included in the end credits, not even as an attempt at making a quick profit.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of Dragon Ball I am simply ashamed. This was indeed an even worse follow up than GT, and it makes me fear for what is to come in the future for this show. I am praying that someone in that office wakes up and realizes how much damage they are doing to this series.\\n\\n\r\n------------------\\n\\n\r\n3/20/18 edit:\\n\\n\r\nIt looks as if they refused to fix the gigantic plot hole at the end of that episode 67 I mentioned. Rather they used it to shoehorn the plot even further into the garbage. With that series finale but I can say with certainty that at this point the only reason you'd want to watch this series is if its nostalgia filled motivation. Newcomers looking for a battle shounen, look elsewhere. This is 131 episodes of time padding, repetitive, discontinuous, rubbish.",

            "content": "After being hyped for a while I caught up with the anime today, and decided to write a review because...why not. Being a hardcore DB fan in the past, I was really excited to get a canon continuation of DBZ, but...\r\nStory: 2\r\nThe story gets a 2 because the anime is so far a rehash of the two movies that came out, Battle of Gods and Resurrection of F. The only difference is the awful pacing this time. You're better off watching both movies and skipping what I reckon will be 30 episodes of the anime. The storylines themselves aren't anything to write home about either.\r\nAlso,speaking of DBZ, one can't help but bring up powerlevels. There're a lot of inconsistencies here. One example, one of Friezan's new henchmen is supposed to be stronger than the old Ginyu force (confirmed with a scouter), which means that even Goten should be able to wreck him without any effort, let alone Piccolo, Tien, Krillin, or freaking Gohan. \\n\\n\r\nYet he proceeds to solo EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM without any effort at the same time. Seriously? Piccolo in the original DBZ was fighting Frieza's second form to a stalemate and he's gotten a lot more powerful than that by Cell Saga, going toe to toe with 17, and first form Cell, and then even more powerful in the Buu Saga. Getting wrecked by a guy at Ginyu's level or so (hell, or even double, triple, quadruple that) was ridiculous to watch. Facepalm.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3\\n\\n\r\nArt gets a 3 because it's bad. Scenes which were copied from the movies look spectacular (since the movies are high quality) but everything else looks absolutely terrible, and for no reason at all. TOEI has the budget, they're simply lazy it seems. Anyone who's used to the awesome, detailed, perfectly proportioned character models from DBZ which could be used as wallpapers, will notice the terrible drawings right away. Couldn't help but getting bothered by it and asking why.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\\n\r\nSound gets a 3. DB is probably the only anime which is better in english DUB than SUB, but I watched the SUB nonetheless. The Goku-granny needs to go. Sure, nostalgia goggles and whatnot...but it's just not right. Goku being as old as he is...it's just not right when he sounds like a kid or a woman. Better stick with the ENG DUB.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings, although catchy, are a total mismatch for the series. I'd rather have badly remixed versions of the old openings than this. The OST in the anime is practically nonexistant. I noticed only a couple of musical pieces that play here and there, easily forgettable. They contribute nothing to the excitement of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  5\\n\\n\r\nCharacters get a 5. Goku is pretty much the same, Vegeta is a lot less hostile than before, Whis is a joke and plot device, but the worst thing about the anime has got to be Beerus. I actually liked Beerus in the movies. Sure, he had his idiotic and playful side, but it was also pretty obvious that he was somebody who KNEW STUFF, somebody who was above our heroes in terms of knowledge and wisdom, befitting of his age. \\n\\n\r\nBut this Beerus in the anime acts like a spoiled ass for absolutely no reason at all. Sure, that makes him a tad scarier, knowing you can't reason with him, but after a certain point, all that gets thrown out the window in a moment's notice, and he turns a companion? That's bad. Facepalm.\\n\\n\r\nMoving into the Frieza part of the anime, Frieza is satisfying, truly evil, angry and really crazy. He's awesome, but in true DBZ fashion, characters who are pissed off and have sworn to kill each other, stop in the middle of the battle in order to talk about who fights whom first, and tell each other to wait for power ups/transformations. \\n\\n\r\nReally??? That might be alright in Beerus' case, since he wanted to fight a strong opponent,and was actively searching for one, and maybe for Frieza in the past who was simply arrogant coz he had never lost a fight, but THIS Frieza? One moment he's fuming with anger about everything he went through in HELL, then he's torturing someone for sadistic pleasure until his nemesis arrives, and when said nemesis does arrive, he's chitchatting with him over pointless stuff. The one guy whom he'll do ANYTHING TO SEE DEAD FOREVER. Ridiculous. Facepalm.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this is a dreadful series and less enjoyable than anything that came before it. Watch the Battle of Gods and Resurrection of F movies, and skip this anime altogether. Not really worth it. At least not yet. Maybe once they're done with rehashing the movies...\\n",

They drag out unnecessary scenes over the whole episodes. They try to drag out anything to stall time so they can find a story to animate. The animation is bad, it's clean but bad. Poor camera angels mixed with poor animation and you have a dragon ball super fight. Fight scenes have nothing with them except for punching and kamehameha's. fighting choreography is close to none.  I heard that the animators for dragonball super are new to animation and is just beginning to animate. And you can see how little the creator of dragon balls care about it. Dragon balls used to be a an anime like one punch man, you weren't really there for the story just more for the raw power fights. But it has really gone downhill. If you have watched all the other dragon balls and is wondering if this is worth watching, my answer to you is no. Do not watch it, it will ruin everything you liked about dragon balls\\n",

Cant stay silent when someone butchers a legendary series with a cheap cash-grab.\r\n Not sure where to start so..i'll start with positives, as its whole 2/10 so got to have some, right? Ok. Positives: opening. End of positives.\r\nReally. It looks ok, music isnt terrible...\r\nProblems begin when the opening ends and show starts. Its one of the ugliest series i've seen in YEARS. It looks worse than DB, DBZ ang GT. Can't stop wondering why - dragon ball shits golden eggs for years, so i expected level of FSN: UBW, Naruto Shippuden, One PunchMan and other fighting series we see nowadays. Actually, i'd be happy even with the quality presented in the opening.  But this is straight bad. Characters, backgrounds, effects... everything looks cheap and amateur. Cut-scenes in DB games look better. \\n\r\nLet's continue. Story. It's on a whole different level of bullshit than GT. First of all, its inconsistent with regular DBZ. Examples? Beerus popping out of nowhere, then its further explained that if kaioshins die, he vanishes too. Where was he when Buu was butchering kaioshins? Or in latest events of buu saga when last 2 kaioshins could be annihilated any second? OK, lets say he could pop in a second and 1shot buu...i wont even start with golden freeza, and those random characters with random abilities in tournament, the most unfitting characters in DB World. The future trunks saga is when it totally breaks any logic that was introduced in DBZ. Trunks going back in time created alternative future, events splitted. In 1 continuum goku lives, in other he's dead for good. Then how the heck this joke-of-a-kaioshin from trunks continuum got to know goku and create black in his image, if goku died of disease before anyone knew about beerus and other universes, so if he was dead i guess he couldnt visit the other universe. But fck logic, right? And more problems popup with every episode.\\n\r\nI dont really know japanese, so cant talk about dubbing. Characters sound ok, i like beerus voiceactor. \\n\r\nI kept watching hoping for improvement, end with each episode it was only getting worse and worse and worse and worse....i finally gave up and wont be trying it again. Better to rewatch DBZ remaster next time...",

            "content": "After having watched 69 episodes, I think I can fairly assess whether this story is worth your time or not: it isn't. For the biggest part of the series it really isn't worth it, but there are some small parts which hardcore Dragonball fans might want to see anyway, which is why in addition to reviewing this series, I'll write a how to watch guide too.\r\nLet's start with the Story first.\r\nThe 1st and 2nd episode details where our heroes are and what they're doing after the Buu-saga. FANS CAN WATCH EPISODES 1 AND 2, BUT IT ISN'T NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE STORY.\r\nThen the real storystarts. And it's bad. There's no way around it. The first two arcs of the story is a re-hash of the movies, except each movie is stretched out to fit one arc, causing the story to drag, and this is done for no reason other than to cynically fill the air time and milk the cash cow. The movies are done way better. FANS OF THE DRAGONBALL FRANCHISE SHOULD SKIP EPISODE 3-14 AND WATCH \"BATTLE OF GODS\" INSTEAD. \\n\r\nEpisodes 15-19 are filler.\\n\r\nEPISODES 20-27 IS \"RESURRECTION F\", SKIP THIS AND WATCH THE MOVIE.\\n\r\nFrom episode 28 on, we get to see actual original content. The first arc, didn't much impress me, although there were some chuckle worthy moments here and there, it was pretty much standard tournament fare. FANS WHO LIKE WATCHING DRAGONBALL'S QUIRKY MARTIAL ARTS TOURNAMENTS SHOULD WATCH EPISODES  28-41, BUT SKIP EPISODE 30, WHICH IS A RECAP. OTHERWISE, WATCH EP28 (INTRODUCES NEW CHARACTERS) AND EP31 & EP41 (INTRODUCES NEW CONCEPTS), AND SKIP EVERYTHING ELSE.\\n\r\nEpisodes 41-43 are filler.\\n\r\nNext a new mini arc that's kicked off by Trunks and Goten. Again, some quirky humor and chuckles, but nothing great to write home about. Except for the very ending of episode 46, which introduces the next arc. FANS OF TRUNKS AND GOTEN CAN WATCH EPISODES 44-46 IN ITS ENTIRETY, OTHERWISE SKIP EVERYTHING UNTIL THE LAST 10 MINUTES OF EPISODE 46.\\n\r\nThe next arc, which is the Black arc, was very entertaining... despite its plot holes. For some reason, I really liked the villain, and his attitude; he was probably the best thing about the entire super series. Actually, he might be the ONLY good thing about this series... THIS ARC, RUNNING FROM EPISODE 47-67, IS THE REASON YOU SHOULD BE WATCHING SUPER, IT'S THE ONLY LEGITIMATELY ENTERTAINING THING ABOUT THIS SERIES.\\n\r\nEpisode 68 is filler, and episode 69 is filler with a crossover to Toriyama's other manga and stuffed with visual gags. Neither impressed me. IF YOU LIKE DR SLUMP AND ARALE-CHAN, WATCH EPISODE 69.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to Art. It should have improved over its 80s and 90s counterpart considering the availability of new technology, but instead it's WORSE. And not just a little, but A LOT worse. If your modern animation looks worse than the aged counterpart, then something's definitely gotta be wrong here. Sailor Moon Crystal knew this and brushed up their 3rd season, but Dragonball Super... not so much.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Sound, there's nothing wrong with it, but there's nothing great about it either. I was not blown from my chair. The fifth ED does like to get stuck in my head for some reason though, so that probably a plus point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are dreadful. Everything you knew and loved about your characters is made into a gag or exaggerated. Whatever growth they had experienced in the previous two series is gone. The characters have basically become a parody of themselves and are annoying. TV Tropes would call this flanderization. The only interesting character is the villain from the Black arc, and that says a lot about this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment can pretty much only be found in the Black arc. The rest is mediocre to terrible drivel.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series rests upon the shoulders of one character, and that character is the villain of one arc. The rest is just not that interesting and sometimes even downright terrible.",

Equal Vegeta and Goku beat everyone, 5 vs 5 something very strange or unnecessary, then this Frost, conveniently showed us that he is a good subject and such nonsense, being that in the previous fight did not do the same with Botamo, but hey, then it turns out he is bad and I do not know what . Hit, the kind of 1000-year-old who can stop time, who overcomes the power of Goku and Vegeta, being both have the power of the gods (and included in a higher phase), the god level is so mediocre that it can be reached And overcome by anyone? And worst of all, the Kaioken * 10, with that mother should have killed Hit by just touching it, but no, and even loses ... Then comes the twist comic plot with Monaka and Bills also fulfilling the desire of Champa, Making the whole saga a nonsense.\\n\r\nIn the saga of black the most salient are that they went all over the ass with powers, like Black saying that because he has the body of a Saiyan he gets stronger every time he fights, but Genkai saiyan works only when they hurt you Gravity and you recover and not of cina you will raise the power of a ssj1 to that of a ssjdssj, Trunks and its deus ex machina supreme, first holding battles with Black and Zamasu, being that both gave to a pump to Goku and Vegeta in mode Blue, then acquiring an aura similar to that of the gods because I do not know, his sword resists a chingo (Although of course, in Z his sword could cut Freezer, the most powerful race at the time, but not 2 humans with part Robotic), it is obvious that Vegetto was just to attract more publicity and it's okay, I would not care so much if they did not leave the pothara union as worthy dick as the dance, all that was a Plot Device for which Trunks (which inexplicably Said that he would defeat Zamasu, being that Vegetto at that moment was giving him a slap), then generates that \"Genkidama\" with energy of the earth and a population fucking REDUCED (With energy of Goku and Vegetas done shit and in base mode), Being that to kill Buu was necessary a Genkidama universal and equal Buu resisted, it does not make sense that Zamasu to die so easy, but GOD EX MACHINA + GARY STU = Trunks. Many say that humans guided their energy and hope to Trunks and so they did not raise their hands, well, when they learned to master / control their Ki? One very important thing would be that Vegetto in ssjdssj should destroy the earth with the shock wave in one fell swoop, is a fucking OP character, but when he launches the Final Kamehameha the UNIVERSE should have been worth dick, but nothing happens to the earth. Previously they made the conveniences subtle, but now everyone noticed (Although good, 80% of fans complain about the duration of the merger, this being the least important compared to all other inconsistencies in the chapter). Trunks defeated Cell and the Androids \"Yes, because I TRAIN quite and its power was not so far from an inperfecto cell or the androids. It might be good that Trunks will defeat Zamasu but not with something so forced.\\n\\n\r\nThis saga in specific was to attract more public, I know several people who did not see DBS but started to see this saga, Akira should be counting his money while laughing at his fans.\\n\\n\r\nDbz also had very stupid mistakes, mainly in the saga of the androids and cell, but they were more subtle, DBS is so bad that even the PLEBS can notice that everything is wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThis last arc improved a little bit, since from the beginning there was a change in the color palette that made it no longer look all stiff and was more pleasing to the eye.\\n\r\nOne of the most notorious things about the tournament is the lack of originality in the characters, not only in design but also in skills, almost everything was reduced to hits instead of strategies or even interesting techniques.\\n\r\nRoshi, Krillin and Tenshinhan have their own chapters where they are given a little time on screen, Roshi being the most interesting and Tenshinhan the most boring.\\n\r\nIt is impossible not to notice the stupidities of the writers when supposedly important things happen, for example, when Frost was going to eliminate Roshi, Goku was like an idiot screaming and could not escape ... The guy is a god and to top it off he has teleportation ! This happens very often.\\n\r\nA very annoying thing is the emotional manipulation to eliminate a universe that we know absolutely nothing (literally), put phrases and sad melodies, being that they did not have the ability to make us care as spectators.\\n\r\nOnly one universe behaved credibly by being eliminated, acting scared and desperately trying not to be eliminated.\\n\r\nSaiyan girls are one of the worst things in the franchise, being a Mary Sue full-fledged, acquiring powers removed from the ass and extremely stupid transformations (Broly, WITHOUT SENSE) to then carry out the fusion Pothara that seemed to be even stronger that Vegetto.\\n\r\nHit is eliminated for being stupid.\\n\r\nVegeta takes a meaningless transformation out of his ass for a super cheap drama that even he does not believe himself.\\n\r\nHit and his past 3 minutes of unnecessary exposure are something that is not even worth talking about.\\n\r\nUltra instinct, ultra improved instinct, ultra Jiren instinct, all are power ups taken from the ass.\\n\r\nThe end with 17 reviving all the universes was too predictable but it's funny to see how it arrives 18 and says \"But 17, and you travel with your family?\" Dialogues so stupid that break the immersion.\\n\r\nFrieza the revived and apparently continue the story with the Resurrection of Frieza 4.0.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the first two arcs are the movies made even worse and unnecessarily lengthened, the first tournament of universes is a nonsense for that horrible final and has too many power ups nonsense that even they respect, the saga of Black is undoubtedly the worst , having 10 inconsistencies with Z and even with the same Super per chapter and the tournament improving a little but without being something remarkable.\\n\r\nAnimation of shit carried by animators who seem not to strive, there were only a few caps where there really was fluency and good drawing.\\n\r\nThe OST is not particularly noteworthy but has a good track record.\\n\r\nThe choreography of combat is terrible, showing only one or two planes, reducing everything to blow hit with limited animation, to be a shounen of fights this is very bad.\\n\r\nWas not this supposed to show what happened to reach the epilogue of Z?\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nRese\u00f1a de todo Dragon Ball Super hasta el capitulo 131\\n\r\nVayamos por partes porque todo en Dbs es un error.\\n\r\nDbs inicio con rehacer las pel\u00edculas, supuestamente para corregir fallos, pero en ambas ponen sucesos como lo e Tagoma (creo que as\u00ed se llamaba), dej\u00e1ndolo vivo, con una pseudo motivaci\u00f3n para que luego llegar\u00e1 Ginyu y se robara el cuerpo e igual Ginyu muere, haciendo todo esto irrelevante, hab\u00eda escenas en la pel\u00edcula que duraba con 5 minutos y la serie los alargo hasta a 2 cap\u00edtulos, siendo que 1 pel\u00edcula se puede resumir hasta en 4 cap\u00edtulos.\\n\r\nEl arco del torneo me parec\u00eda el peor de todos, dejando de lado que hagas un torneo con 2 tipos que tienen el poder de un dios, desaprovecharon a todos los dem\u00e1s, Piccolo valiendo verga con una estrategia bien pendeja, siendo que en Z el tipo si pensaba bien, Gohan hab\u00eda dicho que entrenar\u00eda y aqu\u00ed ni aparece, Majin Buu, osea, pinche ser extremadamente fuerte y salen con una tonter\u00eda de que no puede entrar porque no sabe escribir... Igual Vegeta y Goku vencen a todos, haciendo el 5 vs 5 algo muy extra\u00f1o o innecesario, luego esta Frost, convenientemente nos mostraron que es un buen sujeto y esas tonter\u00edas, siendo que en la pelea anterior no hicieron lo mismo con Botamo, pero bueno, luego resulta que es malo y no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9. Hit, el tipo de 1000 a\u00f1os que puede detener el tiempo, que supera el poder de Goku y Vegeta, siendo que ambos tienen el poder de los dioses (e inclusos en una fase superior), el nivel dios es tan mediocre que puede ser alcanzado y superado por cualquiera? Y lo peor de todo, el Kaioken*10, con esa madre deber\u00eda de haber matado a Hit con solo tocarlo, pero no, e incluso pierde... Luego llega el plot twist c\u00f3mico con Monaka y a Bills cumpliendo igualmente el deseo de Champa, haciendo a toda la saga con un DESPROPOSITO.\\n\r\nEn la saga de black lo mas resaltable son que se pasaron todo por el culo con los poderes, como Black diciendo que porque tiene el cuerpo de una Saiyan se hace mas fuerte cada vez que pelea, pero el Genkai saiyan funciona solo cuando te hieren de gravedad y te recuperas y ni de co\u00f1a te subir\u00e1 el poder de un ssj1 a el de un ssjdssj, Trunks y sus deus ex machina supremos, primero sosteniendo batallas con Black y Zamasu, siendo que ambos le dieron una putiza a Goku y Vegeta en modo azul, luego adquiriendo un aura similar a la de los dioses porque Yo No S\u00e9, su espada resiste un chingo (Aunque claro, en Z su espada pod\u00eda cortar a Freezer, la raza mas poderosa en su momento, pero no a 2 humanos con partes roboticas), es obvio que lo de Vegetto fue solo para atraer mas publico y esta bien, no me importar\u00eda tanto si no dejaran a la uni\u00f3n pothara tan vale verga como la danza, todo eso fue un Plot Device para que Trunks (El cual inexplicablemente dijo que derrotar\u00eda a Zamasu, siendo que Vegetto en esos momentos le estaba dando una putiza), luego genera esa \"Genkidama\" con energ\u00eda de la tierra y una poblaci\u00f3n jodidamente REDUCIDA (Con energ\u00eda de Goku y Vegetas hechos mierda y en modo base), siendo que para matar a Buu fue necesaria una Genkidama universal e igual Buu se resisti\u00f3, no tiene sentido que Zamasu muera tan f\u00e1cil, peeeeeeeero DEUS EX MACHINA+GARY STU=Trunks. Muchos dicen que los humanos guiaron su energ\u00eda y esperanza hacia Trunks y por eso no levantaron sus manos, bien, cuando aprendieron a dominar/controlar su Ki? Una cosa muy importante seria que Vegetto en ssjdssj deber\u00eda de destruir la tierra con la onda expansiva de un solo golpe, es un personaje jodidamente OP, pero cuando lanza el Final Kamehameha el UNIVERSO debi\u00f3 valer verga, pero a la tierra no le pasa nada... Anteriormente hac\u00edan las conveniencias medio sutiles, pero ahora todos lo notaron (Aunque bueno, el 80% de los fans se quejan de la duraci\u00f3n de la fusi\u00f3n, siendo esto lo menos importante a comparaci\u00f3n con todas las dem\u00e1s incoherencias del capitulo) \"El futuro debe ser arreglado por alguien de ese futuro, por eso Trunks derroto a Cell y a los Androides\" Si, porque ENTRENO bastante y su poder no estaba tan alejado de un cell imperfecto o los androides. Pudo ser bueno que Trunks derrotar\u00e1 a Zamasu pero no con algo tan forzado.\\n\r\nEsta saga en especifico fue para atraer a mas publico, aunque todo lo que trajo son PLEBS y elitistas a los que les dan un muy buen material para echarle mierda.\\n\\n\r\nEste ultimo arco mejor\u00f3 un poquito, ya desde el principio se vio un cambio en la paleta de colores que hacia que ya no se viera todo acartonado y era mas agradable a la vista.\\n\r\nUna de las cosas mas notorias del torneo es la falta de originalidad en los personajes, no solo en dise\u00f1o sino tambi\u00e9n en habilidades, casi todo se reduc\u00eda a golpes en lugar de estrategias o t\u00e9cnicas siquiera interesantes.\\n\r\nRoshi, Krillin y Tenshinhan tienen sus propios cap\u00edtulos donde se les da un poco de tiempo en pantalla, siendo Roshi el mas interesante y Tenshinhan el mas aburrido.\\n\r\nEs imposible no notar las estupideces de los escritores cuando pasan cosas supuestamente importantes, por ejemplo, cuando Frost iba a eliminar a Roshi, Goku estuvo como idiota gritando y seg\u00fan no pod\u00eda escapar... El tipo es un dios y para colmo tiene la teletransportaci\u00f3n! Esto ocurre muy seguido.\\n\r\nUna cosa muy molesta es la manipulaci\u00f3n emocional al eliminar a un universo del que no conocemos absolutamente nada (literalmente), ponen frases y melod\u00edas tristes, siendo que no tuvieron la capacidad de hacer que nos importe como espectadores.\\n\r\nSolo un universo se comport\u00f3 de una manera cre\u00edble al ser eliminado, actuando asustados y tratando desesperadamente de que no los eliminaran.\\n\r\nLas ni\u00f1as Saiyan son una de las peores cosas de la franquicia, siendo unas Mary Sue hechas y derechas, adquiriendo poderes sacados del culo y transformaciones sumamente est\u00fapidas (Broly, SINSENTIDO) para luego llevar a cabo la fusi\u00f3n Pothara que parec\u00eda ser incluso mas fuerte que Vegetto.\\n\r\nHit es eliminado por ser un est\u00fapido.\\n\r\nVegeta se saca del culo una transformaci\u00f3n sin sentido por un drama super barato que ni \u00e9l mismo se cree.\\n\r\nHit y su pasado de 3 minutos de exposici\u00f3n innecesaria son algo de lo que ni siquiera vale la pena hablar.\\n\r\nUltra instinto, ultra instinto mejorado, ultra instinto de Jiren, todos son power ups sacados del culo.\\n\r\nEl final con 17 reviviendo a todos los universos era demasiado predecible pero da gracia ver como llega 18 y dice \"Pero 17, y tu viajo con tu familia?\" Di\u00e1logos tan pendejos que rompen la inmersi\u00f3n.\\n\r\nFreezer el revivido y aparentemente continuar\u00e1 la historia con la Resurrecci\u00f3n de Freezer 4.0.\\n\\n\r\nEn general, los dos primeros arcos son las pel\u00edculas hechas aun peor y alargada innecesariamente, el primer torneo de universos es un desprop\u00f3sito por ese horrendo final y tiene demasiados power ups sinsentido que ni ellos mismos respetan, la saga de Black es sin duda la peor, teniendo 10 incoherencias con Z e incluso con el mismo Super por capitulo y el torneo mejorando un poquito pero sin ser algo destacable.\\n\r\nAnimaci\u00f3n de mierda llevada por animadores que parecen no esforzarse, solo hubo unos pocos caps donde realmente hubo fluidez y buen dibujo.\\n\r\nEl OST no es particularmente destacable pero tiene una que otra buena pista.\\n\r\nLa coreograf\u00eda de combate es p\u00e9sima, mostrando solo uno o dos planos, reduciendo todo a golpe golpe con animaci\u00f3n limitada, para ser un shounen de peleas esto es muy malo.\\n\r\n\u00bfNo se supon\u00eda que esto era para mostrar lo que paso para llegar al epilogo de Z?",

            "content": "Ahhhh, Dragon Ball Super, the canon version of some weird fanfiction called Dragon Ball AF. Let's start!\r\n*Movie recaps: you can't start an anime with just a recap of the first two (bad) movies. It's feels more like filler and just a waste of time. The episodes are excessively long and the terrible animation is over the top.  EXAMPLE? Remember episode 5? The story is bad just like that movies. Retcons, asspulls, resurrections, lazy designs of 'new' transformations. 1/10\r\n*Super Tournament Arc: the reason of this Tournament makes no sense in the first place. Champa can gather the Super Dragon Balls without discuss with Bills. Iknow that fights are important here but at least give me a decent reason of why they are fighting! The worst part is that they are a disaster (asspulls, zero strategy). Piccolo is defeated by Frost because he was cheating, for that, he can't return. Goku is defeated for the same reason yet he can return!? Because is the MC, of course! The arc is just Vegeta and Goku vs Universe 6. The other characters are just wasted potential. Majin Boo can't enter because he failed to some written test? LMAO 2/10\\n\\n\r\n*Future Trunks Arc: they tried to give us a different villain there but as the arc  proceeds it becomes your sadist and standart villain. Zamatsu is highly hypocritical, he wants to kill all the mortals believing them to be the source of all evil. Yes, i got it! But you can do that with Super Dragon Ball that you had! Why do you slowly kill everybody!? The series tries (and fail) to sympathise with him but he is just a sadist! Almost all the scenes are bad: Trunks being just a Gary Stu (just look the ending of the battle!), repetive (so many time travels are just ridiculous!), asspulls, Goku Black have some unexplained and forced new transformation (also the desing is very lazy), Goku being more idiot than ever and they tried to establish  a weird and nonsense romance between Future Mai and Future Trunks LOL?! 2/10 (the only interesting scene was Future Zeno erasing all the universes).\\n\\n\r\n*Tournament of Power Arc (or the Tournament of Asspulls Arc): the most 'hyped' tournament! I know that Goku loves fighting but what he do is something antithetical here, everybody that loses this tournament will be erased by Zeno. Despite that, Goku doesn't care and just want to fight strong guys. This arc consists on two factors: no tension or forced tension. The first were in the first episodes of the arc and in the middle. It was supposed that everybody IN THE UNIVERSE will be killed if they lose yet many of them take the issue far too lightly. The second is the overdramatic episodes, many are scared that universe 7 will be erased! Nobody remeber the ending of Z? They are alive! There are some interesting subplots that were forgotten like Frieza plan in the tournament (nothing happens in the end). The fights are slightly better but the asspulls are still over the place again. The most clear example was Kefla (Caulifla and Kale fusion), she exists just to be owerpower and nothing more. And now, Jiren, is personality is all over the place. First, he is a calm guy that thinks before acting. Suddenly, after some generic and tragic flashback, he goes full fledged yandere for no reason! There is no consistency in anyway. Of course, the ending is just everybody reviving. I don't dislike so much this arc like the others, 17 and 18 were cool and very few fights scenes are decent. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of blood,  bad animation, retcons that ruined Z, the characters are just parodies of themselves, asspulls. Ehh, this series makes me ashamed to like Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. It hurts that a decent franchise was ruined just for the sake of money. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nFiller: 0/10\\n\\n\r\n2/10 overall. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Ifyou ever watched GT you'ed know that most of the conflicts in the anime  took place away from earth. But Gt spent entire episodes flashing out the planets goku and his crew went to. Super spends 4 minutes on each new planet and never comes back to them. This makes the universes in super feel shallow and void of life. \\n\\n\r\nIn short\\n\\n\r\nPuddle deep worlds, bad writing, shit animation, shallow and occasionally edgy characters, and a lot less screaming.

The comic scenes with King Kai at the beginning are just the treat, Beerus and Whis turn out to be absolute comic geniuses on par with mythological Master Roshi in the original Dragon Ball or Old Kai in Dragon Ball Z. The battle sequences between Goku and Beerus in deep space are unprecedented and IMO they set a milestone for the whole saga in awesomeness.\\n\r\nI think that much a better work could and should have been done with the characters of Gohan, Chichi, Krilin, Goten, Trunks, Piccolo&Co, it seems that Beerus, Whis, Goku&Vegeta, Bulma got a first-class script while the rest of the family is stuck with clich\u00e9 and predictable/boring dialogue. \\n\r\nAbout Vegeta, I think he has the potential to become the most loved character in the series, he is smart, strong, has great timing in its lines and he is (almost) always at the right place at the right time story-wise. \\n\r\nI cannot but highly recommend this Dragon Ball Super who stole my heart and brought me back almost 20 years* and wish you to have as much fun as I had!\\n\\n\r\n*I hope Jaco is not reading me;)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Dragon Ball is and probably always will be my favorite series. I was just an four year old boy when I first had the pleasure of witnessing Dragon Ball on TV. Though I was perhaps too young to understand it, as I got older, I'd eventually move onto Dragon Ball Z. The more I'd aged, the more I grew to love Dragon Ball. I was hooked, and my knowledge of the series was immense. \r\nDragon Ball Super is the continuation and sequel of Dragon Ball Z. The story is quite similar to Z as we see our hero Goku progressively meeting stronger foes and thestakes becoming higher. New elements and characters are introduced such as the Gods. Something that Super has incorporated in this show that sets it apart from Z is character development. The series is also able to incorporate effective drama and genuinely hilarious comedy into its story, the most noteworthy being the action and pure fighting that is reminiscent of Dragon Ball Z.\\n\\n\r\nNow there are a few problems with it right at the start. The first two arcs were basically retelling the movies Battle of Gods and Resurrection F. While the animation can occasionally dip into the inexcusable category (I'm looking at you, episode 5 and over half of Golden Frieza arc), the show is never able to dissuade you from watching it due to the action and nostalgia. However, after those two arcs, the animation gets noticeably better. The OSTs and intros are also very nostalgic. But at the end of the day, it is just more Dragon Ball Z.  I think it is simply nostalgia surrounding the dragon ball franchise for me that makes you just can't help but want to watch it and enjoy it. I think we can all agree the writing is very bad but the action is absolutely amazing.\\n\\n\r\nIf you grew up with Dragon Ball or have watched Dragon Ball Z as a kid or early teens, then you will probably enjoy this series!",

            "content": "So, Dragon Ball Super. A series widely criticized and panned from the beginning, due to a multitude of things. Retelling the past 2 movies, poor animation quality, etc. But as you can see by my score, I actually really like this show! Is it perfect? No, just look at some of those first 27 episodes, and you can really see a struggle to get episodes out.\r\nThis isn't a review of episodes 28-89, it's a review from episode 1. I'll be reviewing each arc separately, before wrapping it all up with my overall thoughts.-Battle of Gods-\\n\r\nThe animation overall during this arc is, in my opinion..pretty good. It tries to imitate the cleaner art style of the movie, and I think it succeeds, for the most part. Minus the extreme mess that was the original airing of episode 5. The story is pretty much just a retelling of the movie, stretched out into 13/14 episodes. Some of the fight scenes are now longer, some filler scenes have been added, or new perspectives. It's pretty minor stuff, not a whole lot to change my mind about the movie. If you want the \"definitive\" Battle of Gods experience, I recommend watching the movie, but also watch some of the new scenes, and that last fight can be swapped out for the TV version.\\n\\n\r\n                  -Resurrection 'F'-\\n\r\nLook. I'm not the biggest fan of the original movie, and sadly this arc does little-to-nothing to improve upon the original material. Time restrictions and tight schedules led to poor animation, and it really shows in some of the later episodes. There's this odd addition of Captain Ginyu that just happens at one point, for around 5 minutes, but that's really all of note. I'd say skip this arc, just watch the movie. Or don't watch the movie, and read the manga. It's up to you.\\n\\n\r\n                  -Universe 6-\\n\r\nYes! The first real original content to come from Super...and it's a tournament arc. Okay, I know people like tournament arcs, whether it be My Hero Academia or Hunter x Hunter, and fans of the original Dragon Ball probably appreciate them doing a tournament arc. To me, however, that's one of the issues of this arc: it's just a tournament. There aren't really any stakes, no universe-destroying threat, it's a fight compilation. And while the fights are pretty good (Hit vs Goku for example), and the arc certainly sets up later stories as well as introducing some new and unique characters, there's not much else. If you just want some good fights, then yeah, I can recommend this arc. If you want a tournament with stakes..I'll save that for later.\\n\\n\r\n                  -Future Trunks/Goku Black-\\n\r\nAs a fan of Future Trunks, you can bet I was excited when I heard that he'd be in the \"newest arc of Dragon Ball Super\". Any excuse to give Eric Vale more work is fine with me. But then I saw an \"evil Goku\", and I was intrigued. Before I dig deep into this arc, a few things:\\n\r\n\u2022 Yes, the time travel did get convoluted at times, but I still enjoyed it\\n\r\n\u2022 Yes, the Potara retcon did annoy me at first, but I believe it will allow for more Vegito\\n\r\n\u2022 Yes, the ending was a little lackluster, but I enjoyed it\\n\\n\r\nNow, with that out the way, I can truly dig in. Goku Black is a great villain, with a great voice in both English (via Xenoverse 2) and Japanese. Seeing how the Kaioshin from Universe 10 differ from the ones of Universe 7 was also nice. I loved seeing Trunks as a broken man, fighting for what little was left of humanity in his timeline. The arc was full of great moments, like the Final Kamehameha, Super Saiyan Rage (or even Ros\u00e9), and the conversation between Future Trunks and kid Trunks. By far, my favorite arc of Super so far. I do not recommend skipping it, but I do recommend reading the manga in addition to watching the anime. The  differences between the two are interesting, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\n                  -Universe Survival-\\n\r\nLimit Break x Survivor is amazing. The subtle changes in the art style that were made are noticeable, and add a layer of beauty to the show. The fact that Goku sort of caused this arc by suggesting the tournament back in the Universe 6 arc shows to me that the writers remember previous arcs. Although we're still in the build-up to the actual tournament, I can clearly say why I think it's better than Super's other tournament arc. \\n\r\n\u2022 It has real stakes, the destruction of multiple universes\\n\r\n\u2022 Each member of our main team has had development\\n\r\n\u2022 Goku's attitude has turned against him, everyone is targeting him\\n\r\n\u2022 It feels like the story could go anywhere, while setting things up\\n\\n\r\n                  -Overall-\\n\r\nDespite a rocky start, and lackluster moments, Dragon Ball Super has - at least in my eyes, become an entertaining and fun show to watch every week, with an endless amount of possibilities for the story. While it still takes place in that 10 year gap between the end of the Buu saga and the last episode of Z, I wouldn't be surprised if it went past that final moment after the Universe Survival arc. In fact, I hope it does! See, I enjoy Super so much because of where it could go with its concepts. Gods, other universes, I'm really interested where the story goes next.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a Dragon Ball fan, or just want some good fights, I definitely recommend Super. If you were turned off by the early episodes and their animation, give it another chance, will ya?",

            "content": "Dragon Ball Super Review\r\nStory (6/10) Fair\r\nIf you are looking for a great story in Dragon Ball (past the pre-DBZ stuff) in 2018 you are doing it wrong. We all know Akira Toriyama is far from the best when it comes to this department so I never go in looking to have my mind blown by it. But in my opinion at least it never gets to the point where it's completely brain dead stupid that I feel like my intelligence is being directly insulted (like Fairy Tail for example yes shots fired but no one is defending that anime's story anyway). The anime started offgiving us the rehashed and in my opinion an overall inferior version of the Battle of Gods and Resurrection 'F', so many were quickly turned off during these two starting arcs and I don't blame them as it has some of the worse art style and animation the series had to offer regardless of the excuses or reasons of it looking the way they did, it should not have been released like that. A few changes like Ginyu making an appearance but nothing significant enough for anyone to say Toei did a better job the second time around with these to arcs in comparison to the movies. The Universe 6 Arc is when the series starts some new worth watching content as we get brand new characters. Although there were a few fights that were good like the Goku vs Hit fight majority of them fell short of what I and majority of the people I talked to after this arc was over expected. The story for this arc was decent and acceptable also especially with the ending introducing Zeno and revealing an even greater force to be reckoned with giving the series promise to where it would go next. The Future Trunks Arc after this was probably in my opinion the best arc in the entire series as it was the only time I personally felt the gave me the nostalgic feeling of actual threat to the characters and story. The execution in this arc I felt was quite good also even though there were a few short comings like the reveal of who Goku Black actually was and the who scheme behind it. Majority of this arc I felt keep it up with the standards that I remember back in the Z days. The final arc in the series The Universal Survival Arc was hyped up as it was hyped up to be a bigger and crazier version of the Universe 6 arc with it's one threat of the multiple universe at stake even though I was technically on a bigger scale of threat compared to the Future Trunks arc I guess since there was so many light heard and joky moments during this arc I never took it too massively serious. A ridiculous amount of build up to this arc, many many characters introduced and a shit ton of good fights. That's all good an all because coming into anything Dragon Ball like I said after Z that's all you are going to really get. Many many good fights happened in this arc definitely the best fights, animation and art style the series had showcased but from a story standpoint once again you shouldn't be expecting much especially from an arc that's basically just a giant Team Battle Royale which lasted basically over 1 year to conclude but 48 minutes in the show (how? idk). Although it didn't (at least to me) feel dragged out I do definitely have my issues with how some characters were handle but I'll mention more about that in the characters section. The Universal Survival Arc overall was a treat for the good fights we got out of it but I wouldn't call this the best arc just because it had the best fights I would give that to the Future Trunks arc. Either way you look at it all of the arcs presented in Super were fair at best and nothing to brag about to say the most. But like I'll say one more time story isn't the reason we watch Dragon Ball as it's not abysmal we fans of Dragon Ball accept it for what it is. (Or should I speak for myself?)\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (7/10) Good (For the most part)\\n\r\nAt it's worst (4/10)\\n\r\nAt it's best (10/10)\\n\r\nMore Specifically (7.00/10 when you average both of those together)\\n\\n\r\nThe Beginning of Dragon Ball Super from an animation and art style standpoint I felt was it's biggest thing working against it. Coming out the gate looking look the hottest of garbage is the worst thing you can do for a first impressions for any series. Still to this day I felt it was a poor decision on Toei's part to let such a thing occur for those first few episodes should have been looking spotless, first impressions is extremely important and the result of what happened only proves this statement to be true as many many fans of Dragon Ball dropped it within the first 5 episodes when they saw such a pathetic excuse of art style and animation being showcased and still to this day have not returned to the series and I don't blame them. With all that being said just because the start of the anime was terrible doesn't mean it should be ignored as powerhouse animation directors like Yuya Takahashi and Naotoshi Shida eventually show up and blow everyone's heads off with their effort. Sadly even with their efforts the most the people who dropped the series will do is watch the clips of what they have done on Youtube say \"yeah that impressive but that crap at the start of the anime lost me and I can't invest the time to want to get to where ever the hell this is\". Good things come to those who wait sure but like I said earlier first impressions are everything now these days especially in anime. And with all that being said overall not taking the worst of the worst or the best of the best from an animation standpoint into more consideration that the other on a regular basis the anime's art style and animation wasn't anything to brag or complain about to be honest and if you take that into consideration if the worst of the worst is averaged in with the best of the best you get the score I came out with which is a solid 7. I personally think it's fair since the best of the best is some of the best I've seen in all of Dragon ball animation and I personally feel it outweighs the worst of the worst this anime has shown.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10) Great\\n\r\nMore Specifically (9.50/10) Great+\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for the anime I feel is the best part about it. From the openings to the countless endings, voice acting (JP VA), sound effects and background music I felt they were all great in every department in the sound category. They also did a great job and from the little that I've heard from the English Dub, it sounds like everything is great over there also with some extra flair to it's dialogue script.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10) Fair\\n\r\nMore Specifically (6.50/10) Fair+\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Dragon Ball were always something that was always endearing to me. But sadly over the time majority of the characters has failed to develop, impress or even stay relevant. The old saying in Dragon Ball Z (and even GT for that matter) days were \"if you aren't a Saiyan you ain't shit\". But now in the days of Dragon Ball Super it's basically \"if you ain't Goku you ain't shit\". Now we know the ultimate formula of layout of a Dragon Ball Z arcs for the most part goes bad guys show up Vegeta and maybe Piccolo get a fight, a win or two in until they get mopped then Goku shows up and takes it from there. Majority of the time this formula can be seen in all of the movies. When it came to Dragon Ball Super this formula never really is show cased. (And I'm not counting the first two arcs since both of those were movies originally titled with a Z in their names vs a Super). Even though we don't see this predictable by now formula in Super doesn't mean it's for the better or worse as changing from it only showcased it's pro and cons. One Pro is that since it isn't following that formula, it's hard to predict exactly will happen next, which is good to some degree. The cons show themselves a bit differently as each arc has it's new narrative content but from a story standpoint based on what the characters decided to do they have lead the story down such inconsistencies or disappointments that are shown though out each arc. Like I said I don't really care about high quality story telling when it comes to Dragon Ball and to tell high quality story telling in and story you must also have a high quality/well written characters to coincide the high quality story telling one can say they must go hand in hand. With that being said we all know characters in the Dragon Ball Universe aren't that impressive but we can agree that the characters are better and more interesting than the story they exist within right? (or am I alone on that statement also? anyway..). Either way I'm not going to break down the issues I have with every single character that I thought had an issue with new or old that Super has showcased as this section is already long enough for you to understand where I'm coming from. But what I will do is a quick run down ok?... and... Gohan is a disappointment, Vegeta is still and for ever will be behind Goku (but who isn't?) with Hit and Jiren being the new people pushing Goku farther sadly, Trunks was cool until he left, Hit was awesome until he gets whooped by the hyped up Jiren who's backstory is the most generic backstory I've seen in a hot minute and also get's nerfed 80% of the way thru the arc and ultimately disappoints. Champa was cool tho right? Everyone else isn't worth mentioning even in this short period of time I've given myself.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) Very Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.50/10) Very Good+\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of everything that bothered me with Dragon Ball Super for the 2-3 years that it aired, I was basically present every single week nonetheless excited to some degree for the next episode it next felt like a shore to watch for me. On top of the fact that there wasn't any manga to be ahead of the anime so more so than often not knowing what was going to occur felt like the good old days of Dragon Ball Z. Will I miss Dragon Ball Super? Yeah I can't lie and say that I wouldn't, I love Dragon Ball as a franchise and any complaining I do above is only because I want to see it do better and is the main reason I why continued to watch it through thick and thin and I don't regret it. The amount of enjoyment I got out of Dragon Ball Super every Saturday for the past 2-3 years far exceeds the amount of disappointment that came with it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) Good \\n\r\nMore Specifically (7.50/10) Good+\\n\\n\r\nWith Dragon Ball Super concluding at the time of this review the only thing Dragon Ball we have is the manga which is changing a decent amount of content and the movie later this year. Dragon Ball has shown that it can come back and still be relevant as a top anime at least from a popularity standpoint. I do think that after the movie we will indeed get some sort of sequel to Dragon Ball Super who knows Dragon Ball Ultra? Either way farewell Dragon Ball until we meet again!",

            "content": "SPOILERS duh...\r\nHard work always ran at the core of Dragon Ball Z's appeal.  Inspiring people to get into shape & persevere in the face of unspeakable odds.  Perhaps this is the most appropriate place to focus our critique.\r\nWhat is Dragon Ball Z?\r\nIt's impossible to speak for everyone when it comes to what message you take away from the show.  However I would like to make a case, that perhaps some of the backlash this series has received, can inform why people acted so negatively towards it (at least in comparison to DBZ).\r\n\"Goku never wins\"\r\nI can understand both sides of this argument.Lets first argue against this sentiment.\\n\\n\r\nBeerus: Beerus is not really a 'bad guy' he acts as a sign of whats to come for the story.  After obtaining a new transformation Goku ISN'T able to beat Beerus.  Which I find personally fascinating because that usually doesn't happen in the show.\\n\\n\r\nFrieza: Goku technically wins this fight, but is cheated out.  But in a certain perspective this was a good decision.  Goku's first battle against Frieza is ICONIC, but it only turned out that way because there was a entire arc of buildup.  Vegeta has progressed tremendously as a character and his battle with Frieza holds more weight.  However Goku does kill Frieza last minute, robbing the battle of a proper dramatic ending.\\n\\n\r\nHit: He plays a similar role to Beerus, but on a much smaller scale.\\n\\n\r\nZamasu: This was the most traditional Dragon Ball Z arc in the whole show.  But much like the Android Saga, it ends with Trunks victory.  Remember Gohan Vs Cell wasn't the end of that arc.  It was Trunks vs First Form Cell when he returned back home.  Goku killing Zamasu doesn't hold the same weight because it's not Goku's world thats in danger.  It's Trunks.\\n\\n\r\nJiren: Disappointing end boss.  Not much else to say. (AWESOME fight though)\\n\\n\r\nIt can easily be explained why certain decisions were made in the story, but the major complaint runs back to what I spoke about before.  Hard work.\\n\\n\r\nIn Dragon Ball Z, when Goku beat the final antagonist, it was a thematic representation of hard work.  That if you keep pushing yourself, you can surpass unspeakable odds.  But with the lack of final boss defeats in Dragon ball Super, that theme isn't as resonant.  Goku progresses but it never feels like his training meant anything if he still can't win in the end.\\n\\n\r\nFinal boss fights matter in DBZ, they act as that big moment that makes the whole experience worth watching.  But with no end goal for our heroes (not to mention people like Whis and the other angels still rank HIGH above the Z fighters) the whole workout is just draining.\\n\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super is not a BAD show, but I understand why people were upset.  I still really enjoyed myself despite this above average score, and I would recommend watching the last couple arcs after the movie re-caps.",

            "content": "hello Everyone! This is my first review here so I'll try my best on reviewing this show thus far through my viewing. \r\nThis will be quite a surprise for me to say this but I am actually enjoying this series more than I thought. I know right? Since its A first I need to come out and state why I'm enjoying it. You see it has been a LONG time since we heard there was going to be a new series for the Dragonball Franchise after all, It is a major household name in anime.\r\nI'd advise anyone who are thinking of watching Dragonball Super tohave at the very least watch the previous seasons Dragonball, Dragonball Z and Dragonball kai or just reading the manga otherwise you won't understand much of what is going on thus far if you have not so just thought I should let you know.\\n\\n\r\nNow this might sound weird and completely off to some people out there but I actually prefer this series more for its build up and its variety of content with each episode that feels like it is a genuine continuation, YES I know! So far its just a lesser quality rehash of the 2 movies of battle of gods and Revival of F but from a series standpoint its still at the same time its an interesting continuation of the manga of what its setting up for and I'll gladly say so even if others are put off by it.\\n\\n\r\nSo far in comparison to the first Dragonball, Z and GT whether you are considering comparing them or not, I feel that this gets in a nice stride of fun with that nice sense of comedy relief with its characters in its continuation which in foremost is great to see that it still retains that Akira Toriyama spirit in his depiction which is why I fell in love with the franchise in the first place and I'm glad they didn't decide to bring out some random black star dragonballs out of nowhere which was stupidly added in GT which I didn't like (though I did like his art design for some of the characters in GT) Problem was he wasn't handling the story especially when the story thought it was a good idea to turn Goku into a child throughout the whole ordeal which I found extremely pointless.\\n\\n\r\nSo I'm glad seeing that in this series so far, characters like Goku, Vegeta and many of the others made me feel like I'm watching a proper continuation FINALLY in terms of its setting and surroundings with these certain memorable moments that have happened in the arcs so far. \\n\\n\r\nBeerus definitely feels a little more antagonizing than he was in battle of gods which the show strides to show more and more as it goes along. seen as I watched the film I also noticed some differences with the story in comparison to the movie which is thankfully good in terms elaborating on certain key points in term flushes out more content that will seem to show other alternative points within each episodes that is coming out so far and that alone is evident and exciting also. \\n\\n\r\nFinally the art has had an UPGRADE!! about damn time despite the fact Toei Animation studios lack consistency now and then.\\n\r\nits nothing as dynamic and obviously won't be to that movie quality but it still feels very refreshing to see something not dated for dragonball in 2015 which is nice. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is brilliant too with good animations and hints to where the journey is bound to take the viewers along in their stride of the story with the showcase of new characters and the music is really good and doesn't feel repetitive at all. In fact I'm watching the episodes with the opening so far which goes to show how good the song is.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending if you have seen the previous series also has nice touching memories of nostalgia which the ending songs complements it nicely. \\n\\n\r\nMy real main issue of the show so far is that the story seems to get a bit too quirky and extensive at times which is my main gripe with this show mainly. but so far its getting into build up and also giving way for the fights that will take place in its simplistic approach at this very moment which feels easy for me to sit through and just enjoy the fun.\\n\\n\r\nNow do not go into this with high expectation just because its Dragonball, otherwise it won't be to your liking, after all its an 80s anime in its continuation of the modern day that still retains those very aspects of what made this franchise stand tall for so long now from back then, Of course its not for everyone If others are not willing to tolerate this show for what it is than do not bother anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAlso try thinking of watching this as just another fun, simple and yet silly shounen appetizer after the big main course, that being the previous seasons of the Dragonball franchise. So far I'm enjoying the moment.\\n\\n\r\nThere could be many new stuff to come along the way so who knows..\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading and have a great day wherever you are ;)",

            "content": "I'm here to give my review from an objective standpoint of a fan who has seen and read Toriyama's work.\r\nStory - 6\r\nIts pretty basic, the story is a continuation after the Majin Buu arc that takes place sometime after some time (Its not yet specific as to when in this series) \r\nhowever It doesn't mean its right at the end of Dragon ball Z like some people by accident think, but it does somewhat takes place in between the 2 since there was a 10 year time gap after the majin buu saga and before UuB is even introduce into the story. questionable I knowbut writer Akira Toriyama along with Toyotar\u014d who handles the manga adaptation for Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection \u2018F\u2019 anime and Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection \u2018F\u2019 Special One Shot. \\n\\n\r\nToyotar\u014d is also the official artist of the manga version of Dragon Ball Super and toriyama's staff can usually have certain weaknesses when it comes to consistency and handling such a big franchise then again it has those inconsistencies within the story towards whatever comes and goes in and outside the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nNow I can understand if the confusion for some people as well as fans, well that is if you were paying attention with the story of battle of gods which mostly aren't in some people's cases here and to point out with what the movie was showing was an indication from Toriyama's setting placing these films as parts of the dragon ball super series. \\n\r\nYES toriyama is putting the same storyline from the latest movies but that is not the entire focus of dragon ball Super neither is Frieza's Revival of F we get it everyone in the universe has seen it. \\n\\n\r\nYes it does include rehashing the 2 movies which is a bad drawback here in terms of fans expectation as well as the fact that these movies are still very recent and I get it, Its not acceptable for starting this new series off towards but I still liked to see them to do certain tweaks with its story in regards to the movies, But the main question I guess is Do they do it and does it make that much of a difference? \\n\\n\r\nThis is a mix bag while yes they have made a few certain alterations in some nice ways in the episodes but in terms if it really made that much of a difference? Than If I'm being honest it really at the same time doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't to say its a discouraging thing though, Instead this certain continuation in a way I believe hold these ideas as part of something big to happen for later on. \\n\\n\r\nIn the manga and interviews toriyama has referenced a new UNIVERSE 6 with there being 12 universes mentioned as part of it lore in that shares these 2 movies as part of a long series and I've seen some of the episode listing and its as how these reviewers try describing to you saying that ''OH CRAP THIS ENTIRE SERIES IS THE 2 MOVIES WITH FILLER'' (yes because the author is getting the members of the same staff from GT working on this who wasn't satisfied with GT wants to do another. WOW well done Einstein but your wrong as this is cannon so you can bow out.)\\n\\n\r\nSome have laughably mentioned that these 2 movies take up 100 episodes as most of the majority which is false considering the last point of battle of gods in super is actually within the 12 episodes after the first 2 episode. ''WHAT!? WHY DO I HAVE TO SEE THAT FOR 14 EPISODES?\\n\\n\r\nEasy answer, FOR THE NEW INTRODUCTION OF CONTENT THAT CONTINUES IN THE SERIES AND FURTHER ON DUH, The same goes for revival of F as they are also giving way for certain added features in the mean time on top of this long story, the real question is are you willing to tread far with what ever new content starts going into this series?? \\n\\n\r\nIf so, STOP BITCHING ABOUT THE FIRST 5 EPISODES BEING SHIT IF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY CARE WHERE THE STORY IS GOING,\\n\r\nIF SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ ANY FURTHER. After All I intend to give an objective review, which doesn't mean I'm praising it, let alone Bashing it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you do have a question that you need to address me with you can do so if you not sure on what I'm stating in my review.\\n\\n\r\nIf after the review you are feeling annoyed about my score you can just skip it if you think I'm just wasting Your time. Got it?.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing on, The story in its continuation has an interesting layout so far and I can say I like how the story is expanding on with its new content however there are a lot of inconsistencies so far which seems pretty obvious. \\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't trying to recapture a complete essence of nostalgia but mostly its trying to stay closer to toriyama's light hearted and comedic themes with its continuation in a proper manner where the time skip has happen after the events of majin buu onwards and this would be through the characters we know already of since the start such as Goku as well as the other characters old and new and even those that are strangely in between playing somewhat of a role into this.\\n\\n\r\nBeerus who is a major threat to goku and others recalls a dream to his assistant whis where he predicts that he will face against the super saiyan god. knowing that there is a connection to the saiyan race as well how beerus says about him ordering frieza to depose of the race as he did not like King vegeta now to me it diminishes frieza's character as a villain but can be argued that it makes beerus that more antagonizing and possibly a threat in a lot of ways.\\n\\n\r\nBy the 4th episode we see the supporting characters such as krillin, 18, Tien, yamcha and others play out in the very segment that happens in the movie but in a different location, that doesn't mean to say things change much because for the most part it still showcases a lot of slapstick sillyness which really at times isn't my fancy. \\n\\n\r\nAs goku trains, king kai is aware of the incoming threat that heads to his planet being beerus and whis as they head to confront the last remaining saiyans about the super saiyan god in the hopes of a duel. however these are just the beginning of these episodes. Where we really move from the movies we go into new territory that brings the fans more attention to what has been pretty much setting up for the story. which honestly is a long while but where you want to see new content and not the movies Episode 28 will be that point of interest for those interested.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7\\n\r\nNow despite the fact there really hasn't been too much progression with lots of these characters. For me to go through each of them for analysis is personally too long individually all at once though lets be honest,\\n\r\nYou wouldn't watch this series in the first place if you haven't seen the previous seasons or read the dragonball manga but lets get something straight here. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the very 1st episode, A time of peace has happened as usual from the theme that begins in most dragon ball settings during timeskips. \\n\\n\r\nGoku now alive at this point from the other world is pretty much unsatisfied with his earthly lifestyle which is funny since this is the real first significance in the series where goku is actually working as a family man along with goten, yes gohan and videl we know are easily together at this point as well being that its 6 months later after the events of the Buu arc. \\n\\n\r\nHercule is still regarded as the planet saviour from the public. feeling grateful he gives the prize money to goku and his family which I thought was fair since goku was the true warrior that save the world from the threat of buu.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there goku continues to train with King Kai, Meanwhile goku's rival vegeta is more in tune with his family despite feeling uncomfortable with living a regular family lifestyle with trunks and bulma. Vegeta has come to recognise from the time he fought buu he has changed to feeling more of a connection to his family as well as having the same smug exterior and also still even more determined to surpass goku.\\n\\n\r\nBeerus and Whis who we got to know from battle of gods are extremely powerful beings that are roaming across the galaxy as they see fit. \\n\r\nBeerus being the most chaotic of the 2 destroys multiple planets and civilisations whenever he is not in a good mood or doesn't like the food which at times will feel a lot more silly but at the same time enjoyable to watch for these 2 characters in terms of those comedic moments.\\n\\n\r\nBeerus for me, is the stand out character of the show so far. \\n\r\nI love BEERUS-SAMA!\\n\\n\r\nThe way the writers have build him up so far has been very good in terms of a new big threat within the overall world of the franchise and a unique individual among the cast in general which for me is a smart entertaining addition to the story so far.\\n\\n\r\nAgain there is a lot that could happen from now with the characters, that can change from here on so we'll see a lot more of the other characters in depth later on. \\n\\n\r\nThe real bad of this story has been a lot of its writing inconsistencies at along with its characterisation at times which has been a major gripe I've been having with the show so far. Though Its writing in the franchise in general hasn't really always shown those thoughtful consistency it still at the very least caters to trying to being entertaining in other ways that it conveys in its mood of the characters in general. \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't regard to being picky to a certain demographic nor does it try to steer away from its traditional fun that it places its content with the story since it knows its own entertaining aspects of its genre lies towards in and is for the most part very casual in its very approach in that sense. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - 6\\n\r\nI can agree with most of the reviewers here that episode 5 art was god awful which got a lot more strange with the thick outlines that was present throughout episode 4 which tells me that Toei Animations that have handled a lot of series with long amount of episodes will usually find it very tough to keep the work rate consistent which is a real shame since its been a long time that dragonball fans would get the chance to watch a new dragonball anime that has a difference in art and animation and its sad that early on as this. \\n\r\nThe first 3 episodes to me are still decent and not that bad at all And I feel unlike certain others that its dreadful throughout like a lot want you to believe. \\n\\n\r\nBut it also doesn't excuse A rich company like Toei Animation at times have this ongoing reputation of poor handling of art and animations in series such as One Piece, World Trigger, Digimon, Toriko, Sailor Moon, Yu-Gi-Oh along with SO many others that toei I feel are mainly damaging their own reputation because these are some major household names that they have the rights to the handling of the art and animation in the process. \\n\\n\r\nI simply cannot ignore that they are being quite disrespectful to the shows including most of all Dragonball Super and its fans in terms of their service. Dragonball as a franchise has been one of their biggest profits. I mean just look at how well Battle of Gods and Revival of F did here in the west. \\n\r\n(Which I know already some are mixed on it anyways)\\n\\n\r\nTo me its just odd for a studio that has had great earnings and yet are making this show with inconsistent art and animations in the way it has been for episodes 4 and 5, Though recently it has been handled carefully as of late.\\n\\n\r\nIts Easily not a favourable studio amongst the fans which is obvious, They seemed to have less acknowledgement in what they are doing which I don't believe that to be the characters or the writing what so ever but the animators and designers behind the way certain episodes are handled which is unfortunate and yet Toei have also been known to up the quality when it is needed like they did when they showed off the transformation of SSJ3 Goku but then they didn't keep up with its consistency which makes this section a mixed bag here. then again that possibly could alter or change sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nHell even creator toriyama, TORIYAMA!! of all people was unhappy with the state of its animation and came out about his feelings on it, so you know this is already an issue.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the Visual have started to make a much better improvement now and now I absolutely applaud them for that even at times the art might look a little wonky it is becoming a lot more handled with better care than that of episode 5 at this point.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nApart from some of the characters that sound off in their performance other voice actors such Ryo Horikawa as Vegeta, Kouichi Yamadera as Beerus and Tien, Tsuru Hiromi as Bulma, Morita Masakazu as Whis along with most of the cast sound fine as their respective characters however I don't like the voice actress for goku even though she is notably great in other roles, Jouji Yanami as King Kai I feel he should stick to being the narrator as his performance is showing a rather abysmal display, And I mean no disrespect when saying this.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is can be good at times but then other times it can also be a underwhelming which is lacks that overall feel to some certain scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThis goes without saying but I love The Dragonball Super's opening theme!!! \\n\r\nThe song is very easy on the ear to listen to and not so overblown out of proportion that it feels like another show entirely and It goes well with the art and animation. .\\n\\n\r\nGood morning America also has a nice light hearted beat for its ending as it serves to bring more of a simple and fun movement at its core. \\n\r\nSumitomo has done a few tracks in the series for specific scenes I like so far but not all his soundtracks really hit it out of the park in the way I would of liked it but that might be just down to my own personal taste I guess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nUnlike most of the hate and negative thoughtless reviews this show is ridiculously getting in the space of 5 episodes and so on. I have found the story while having the movies displaying within this series still to be quite reliable with its continuation as a natural viewer I've appreciate some of its episodes so far but its still got ways to carry on from here in terms of that necessary quality of recent animes of this present day and as a fan, It is still pretty exciting and enjoyable without the fact of me feeling that much neglect on what the previous series stood for in terms of its own brand of entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nI'd for one say foremost that this is a okay continuation after Z even if you disagree, Compared to other reviewers I do have great knowledge on this series and I can tell where it delivers so for those looking to write the most negative review about this show are only serving to make other feel negative where I have addressed this in a more constructive fairer manner than these other jokers that can't barely write a review let alone an insult that anyone probably would have heard so many times over by now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nI suggest sticking to the manga as well as the anime if you just want to see where toriyama is going at times with the story. And yes I know the manga is monthly and the anime is weekly which btw the anime is ahead at this moment of time.\\n\\n\r\nBut you still should check out the difference in between though the anime will at times will easily overtake the manga itself which can effect the state of any writers of A story that will have many fans constantly debating what they want all the time which will be at times a real big chore of trying satisfy those out there and toriyama has been known to have those inconsistencies a lot of times of trying to always keep trying to meet fans expectations despite this and other ambitions.\\n\\n\r\nNow and then I feel how passionate and fun the story wants to stay no matter how others will perceive it to be.\\n\\n\r\nIts also a driving force that we even got a new dragonball series and now viewers around at times even after getting a new series is just bitch and moan when something never goes there way which by the way we all can be guilty of this among any written fiction no matter what, so it shouldn't come as a surprise in the way people behave about this franchise (Not saying you can't be critical but at the same time should never over analyse to the point knowing what the series represents as to what it had always started out as a \\n\r\nsimple, fun, battle shonen in the first place) so deal with it. \\n\\n\r\nThe main thing is to have fun with the franchise in general, without going off the deep end of it.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan I've been able to watch the previous series prior to this one which I enjoy still especially since its art/animation was very much ahead of its time from long ago but if you still want to hear more negativity and very blind insights around you because of someones over analysis of it then go right ahead because I for one, don't have any shame of watching Dragon ball super so far and you shouldn't either, After all everyone has different taste as well as mine of just being a dragon ball fan and I'm proud of that.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing the Journey now. Later. \\n\r\nFeel free to ask me any questions about dragon ball super or \\n\r\nmy just review in general.",

If you exclude ANY of them, it will doens't change anything;\r\n-The anime tries tu use fanservice every singles time, but they doesn't make any sense. They grew up Trunks' hair only to show the \"Super Trunks\" transfomation with the exactly same design as before (when he actually had a long hair);\r\n-Goku and Vegeta are not heroes anymore. They've never protected the universe, never won a villain;\r\n-There's no tension, no senseof danger. Jokes are present all the time, even in the middle of the battles or DEATHS;\\n\\n\r\n-Trunks and Freeza's return is completely pointless. It just ruined the characters (since Trunks became a big crying baby, with 30+ years old but with the same appearance as 17 (again, non-sense fanservice));\\n\\n\r\n-The villains there's no motivation. They've tried to make something complex with Goku Black/Zamasu, but they abandoned it in the middle of the saga;\\n\\n\r\n-The powerscale went to hell. Nothing makes sense. Goku Black Pink form is strongest than Goku Blue, which is strongest than any other transformation, but Trunks ssj2 can still beat the enemy;\\n\\n\r\n-It's the only DB production which used the \"friendship power\" as a horrible deus ex-machina;\\n\\n\r\n-Goku became an idiot, he can't even recognize ki anymore. Vegeta dances for Bills and became a tsundere. Future Trunks became a crying babe, he doesn't know how to do anything by himself. Goten e Trunks are 14 years old, but they look younger than Z (with 7). Gohan became the weakest guy of the show, never won one battle;\\n\\n\r\n-The battles are fast, censored, you can't feel the punches, there's no impact;\\n\\n\r\n-The animation is horrible. I think only Berserk 2016 can be worse;\\n\\n\r\n-The direction is completely terrible. Nothing is in the right place. You can't even recognize if it's a serious scene or if it's a joke. The use of the BGMs is pathetc. The angles of the camera, very poor. There's no sense of storytelling. Nothing.",

            "content": "I know that since the start, many have given up on this series, But as for me I've enjoyed the start to this series so far as well as seeing characters we have known for so long now are back yet again. \r\nWould I say its as good as the previous seasons? Definitely not. \r\nbut I guess that will be subjective since it still hasn't gotten too far into this new story at the moment but it sure as HELL still beats Dragonball GT AKA GOKU TIME. Which as you guessed was the only purpose of that show was for Goku's character to have theentire spotlight and very little development unlike anybody else who hardly got any time to shine at all with there being no BEERUS, no WHIS, VADOS, HIT, JACO, or anything to show except for the badass SSJ4 Transformation which you don't see until the halfway point of GT. Apart from that, The entire thing was disappointing and forgettable which is why a lot of fans knew GT Sucked and why its only saving grace was its Art and its Japanese music score other than that everything else about it Lacked in execution Etc.\\n\r\nNow as for Dragonball Super, It is sort of a continuation and at the same it isn't which is really weird if I'm being honest. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem so far with this premise from the start is that its hard to know the exact time where this series sort of starts off from. All that is mentioned is that it begins shortly after the Majin Buu arc in Dragonball Z after the defeat of Kid Buu.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode starts with Goku working in the fields with his son Goten as hes finding his new lifestyle quite dull, he is than met by Hercule who gives him a large sum of money for saving the world from majin buu, thanks to hercule, goku can go ahead in continuing his usual training that he so obsesses over while goten and trunks go on their mini adventure in finding a gift for videl. Meanwhile Vegeta finally plays the role of being a proper father to Trunks and husband to Bulma though that doesn't last to long knowing what saiyans can be like at times. \\n\\n\r\nNow from this point I don't think I need to mention too much of the premise of the story so far since after the first 2 episodes it pretty much follows the story told in the movie of Battle of gods with added padding which will be a turn off to some viewers out there which I don't blame since I also expected something of a new start which Isn't to say its bad but it isn't good thing either in the way how many fans feel mislead. but as of now Its working very well and obviously its been a series that was bound to happen whether you like it or not isn't relevant because Its here now.\\n\\n\r\nSome parts of the anime feel slows and not really that inspiring what so ever and other times it feels like its rushing on too far ahead which for the series is something that needs to improve on now. \\n\r\nDragonball Super at times can be entertaining and can get viewers demanding more pretty quick depending how you can tolerate it. So for the most part its best to not go into this series with such a high expectation of this, Otherwise It will feel stressful to get through since I feel the author Toriyama and Toei Animation in general are still living in the past. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the manga the current co writer of dragonball super, Toyotaro who is the writer of the dragon ball super manga is sticking very close at hand to toriyama's style. That alone could prove to provide some good material but maybe not always to the extent that we, the viewers want. which is always going to be a really tough thing in terms of living up to what has been previously done before in the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nMy main concern with this series is how would this effect dragonball Z current ending where we left off from. after all we got to see new characters towards the end such as Uub, Pan, Bra, teen Goten and Trunks which would of been really cool if they were the new main characters of this series and If they were a lot more older like they were in the end of Z but even at this point on I'm not sure what Toriyama or Toei Animation is thinking besides GIVE ME MONEY or whatever.\\n\\n\r\nSo far in the story it has taken quite a familiar route in terms of what has been done but at least its more dragonball so I'm thankful on that note (again my opinion). \\n\r\nI appreciate that the animation is not dated like it was in the past and has been decent at some points but other times it looks Absolutely shameful in this day and age.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not great at all despite the fact the first couple of episodes were really good and that episode 5 was really bad up and till now it has been very inconsistent especially where it should matter and that is in its action scenes but they have been very mediocre so far.\\n\\n\r\nThe only great fight scene so far that has been done in all honesty to me was Goku Vs Beerus Godlike fight!! (Which most dragonball fights usually excel at) and yet since that there hasn't been many action scenes noteworthy which is a problem. at the same time the episodes are still watchable and I tend to enjoy some of the comedy, slice of life moments through the arcs now and then. Another thing that is great in this series is that you don't have see as much long segments of shouting and powerups like before, so keep that in mind.\\n\\n\r\nToei Animation as some may know unless you really are living under a rock have a bad reputation with having too many projects on their hands to deal with along with their pre-production of new workers and whoever thats in charge of handling of the episodes and its source material would stop making this franchise so inconsistent then it already is now.\\n\\n\r\nSo its no surprise on how they are going about this and considering how popular this franchise was before and still IS, \\n\r\nYou would think they would they would at least for the most part take the time to learn how to plan ahead of time and to animate their stuff properly regardless of their budget and working conditions to how they are finding it tough which to me is only excuse of demanding more business profit without even really taking to much care or consideration over the show or its fanbase. \\n\\n\r\nCan WE just for once have some thought put into this SHOW!!? \\n\r\nCome ON TOEI!! This is SERIOUS business here anyone of us could do a better job than what they are doing with Super so far And Plus SUPER?! Really thats the best title they could come up with? never mind the fact its connected to the whole lore of the Super Dragonballs itself.\\n\\n\r\nBesides my annoyance so far what I will say I'm enjoying the most so far in this are the characters such as their take on Beerus who is overwhelmingly powerful in this version and rightfully so being a God of destruction than he was in the movie and I do like seeing the other characters now but to be fair I would of like to expect more urgency put into the story like for example A great new Galactic Threat anyone? with such powerful characters appearing and being introduce there has been a real lack in terms of danger \\n\r\nIN This SHOW! Why!? \\n\\n\r\nTo be fair I know the chances of danger is there as it has been in the previous series despite the fact there dragonballs but now with powerful characters maintaining balance the problem is the danger is always going to be imminent to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nI can only hope that the new content also from here on in would be enough to suffice after 28 episodes in but if it isn't I will have to resort to putting my rating further down for this show.\\n\\n\r\nNow the Biggest Gripe I liked to mention in Dragonball Super, is its struggle to recall its glory days of the previous series. The plot takes fans on a roller coaster ride through less tension or urgency ever occurring which I will now touch upon. \\n\\n\r\nSo to start off, Each arcs has its own virtues and vices, and have slowly but steadily improved with some new content. Battle of The Gods saga can sum up as a frustrating comedic circus of characters that focuses more on family values and food than martial arts or self improvement. \\n\\n\r\nDragonball Super honestly might as well play out like a family comedy with few occasional action segments in between. The God of Destruction's goals seem to revolve around delicious meals rather than universal annihilation or ambition. Thus, dish after dish of Japanese cuisine is served throughout certain arcs, taking the place of questing for dragon balls and martial arts training. After an anti-climatic ending, the next saga jumps immediately into the action and then after that it just falls into real retarded stuff after.\\n\\n\r\nThough more action-packed, the Resurrection of F story arc relies heavily on nostalgia to make up for faults of the previous arc. The positive qualities of this arc can be found in flashbacks, A former villain returning in Frieza and fight sequences that look straight out of WWE! funny enough I prefer this over that crap any day of the week Imo, no offence to WWE Fans though Its still plagued by comedic distractions like Jaco the space patrolman and strawberry sundaes so what ever rows your boat I guess. \\n\r\nHowever Jaco is made for some real good moments for his character especially within Super.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the current Arc this multi-universal tournament is the series\u2019 first opportunity to show viewers what DBS is really all about. More new opponents are introduced to provide more combat, however the new characters appearance are just unappealing A lot of these new characters are simply just recycled character designs. \\n\\n\r\nThe fights shown are completely underwhelming and we that dragonball as a franchise excels in this really well but Toei Animation just Shits all over this making the characters mundane in their understanding and progression as well as making fans doubt a lot what they have seen from Dragonball and Dragonball Z Respectively which is sad to see. \\n\\n\r\nCatch all that? Yes, that is how its been so far in terms of its inconsistencies that it has shown In other words It has taken over 30 episodes of recycled scripts and filler, but at this point I cant really judge the entirety of this review until I see this arc and the rest of Dragonball Super play out. \\n\\n\r\nWe know from watching this far this series that it hasn't really tried to step up so far which I have no idea why but at the same time because we are in an entirely new arc we finally have gained some traction by shifting its focus back to the action, putting down the fork, leaving the wife and kids on the sidelines, and stepping back into the ring in the midst of fight.\\n\\n\r\nFor me they should of just let this series rest along with many other series I can think of out there. however I've always been in favourite of this franchise and like a lot of anime out there that isn't going to change.\\n\\n\r\nScore Rating\\n\\n\r\nStory thus far: 5\\n\r\nSound/Music: 5\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: IGN Rating 10/10. My rating: TOEI GO FUCK YOURSELVES!.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nOverall: Undecided but for me its a 5 which In case you don't know it means just Average.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend checking out the manga if your that desperate since its better handled than the anime. Do keep in mind however that the manga is monthly and is only just been overtaken by the anime at this point.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that Do not be in a rush to check this anime out at all just yet, not until everything of this show is said and done which will be a long time but either way take my advice.",

            "content": "Well, since I did a review on the horrible story that is One Piece, I decided that I might as well finish what I started, and get all of this off my chest, by doing a review on another Anime done by Toei Animation: Dragon Ball Super. \r\nThere is a famous quote that I would like to apply to Dragon Ball Super, which says \"Everything that has a beginning comes to an end.\" Toei Animation, of course, ignored this quote while selfishly looking at the money bags that would come to them from producing this shameless sequel to Dragon Ball Z. They did not onlyignore the quote, they made fun of it and said \"Do you underestimate the power of merchandising?\" \\n\\n\r\nListen, I like Dragon Ball Z, I LOVE Dragon Ball Z, it was my favorite show as a child by far. I realize that Dragon Ball Super is really not meant for me anymore, but I had watched it as a 15/16 year old at the time of it's airing (The first three arcs at least), and it honestly fell apart after a few arcs, and did not feel like Dragon Ball anymore. \\n\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super starts off with a recap of both the Beerus movie, Battle of Gods, and the Frieza Movie, Resurrection of F. It's a shame they had to recap Battle of Gods because it was honestly a really great movie. Episode 5 of this arc has been widely regarded as one of the worst pieces of animation ever put to Anime. You know, when you start out with one of the best Dragon Ball movies and you ruin it just because you are this greedy, then the sequel is eventually going to be bad. The arc then got better eventually, Beerus is honestly a great villain/anti hero, his introduction was done well, his character design is pleasing to look at, and I'd say he is easily in my top three villains in Dragon Ball due to how intimidating/fun he is. The fight between Goku and Beerus was really good, and I was surprised that it was this good considering how a number of weeks ago we had episode 5. This arc ended on a good note, and was good/great overall. \\n\\n\r\nI was thinking to myself \"Did Dragon Ball Super just have a great arc? Will this continue on? Will they better the animation? Will they have better character development? Will they get better villains?\" The short answer is no. Toei disappointed yet again in the following arc. Same old story, the animation in this arc was even worse. I genuinely could not believe, even as a 15 year old boy, that this was being broadcasted as an actual TV show. The animation during the Goku/Frieza fight is honestly an insult to all of Dragon Ball. The designs and the faces during the fight felt like they were being drawn by a child, not a professional animation studio. This is not to mention how Frieza jumped this high in power, horrible power scaling done to advance the plot. \\n\\n\r\nSince every one of Dragon Ball's arcs is condensed into a basic shonen formula, reviewing every single arc would be pointless, so let us look at Dragon Ball Super in a broader sense and discuss it's power scaling as a whole. I feel like the power scaling is what ruined all of Dragon Ball Super. \\n\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super's power scaling is just one big mess to be frank. Where do you start with it honestly? Dragon Ball Z did not always have the best power scaling. For example, you had the awfully inconsistent zenkai boosts during the Namek saga, something that Toriyama pulled right from his pocket and decided to just place it in there as a sudden explanation as to why Saiyans get stronger, and as a way for our heroes to always defeat the bad guys. Dragon Ball Super did not avoid this issue, they looked at the issue and asked \"How can we make this problem ten times worse than it already is?\" You have instances where even the hardcore Super fans cannot defend it. Instances such as Krillin fighting off against Super Saiyan Blue Goku. This fight was ridiculous, and you cannot honestly tell me that Goku was holding back, because if he was, he would have gradually transformed from his weakest form to his most powerful form. An excuse I hear about this is that Goku was trying to motivate Krillin into thinking he was doing well against him in his strongest form. Really? Did these people forget that Krillin knows that he is leagues below base level Goku? It was honestly just done to hype up the lame fight so that more viewers will watch, and to result in more controversy, therefore resulting in more publicity for the Anime. That is the only logical explanation. The fact that Goku started all out against Krillin, but not against Jiren is just ridiculous. The writers could have avoided all these problems by not having Goku turn into the eighth color of the rainbow against Krillin, with no explanation as to why. The writers dug themselves into this hole and should not be surprised at the negative backlash. \\n\\n\r\nIt does not just stop with Krillin. Every single member of the team that Goku assembled during the TOP arc just magically got stronger. All of these average characters, who were nothing one episode before the TOP arc started, just got magically stronger than the eighth color of the rainbow. These characters trained for a mere fraction of the time that Goku and Vegeta had been training for, and got this strong. It's honestly a joke, and Dragon Ball Super can't be taking itself seriously at this point.... but it actually is.... \\n\\n\r\nThe Zamasu arc is even worse than the preparation arc because Dragon Ball Super made even less sense than it usually does during this arc, and the asspulls were too much to handle. How can a guy like Trunks, who is infinitely weaker than Vegito/Zamazu, defeat Zamasu? Back in Dragon Ball Z, it took everyone on earth to  power up the spirit bomb to the point where it could kill Buu, but Trunks makes one that is a million times stronger with an abandoned city and a dead planet. Nobody can defend this terrible writing. I challenge any fan of this Anime to come and defend it. \\n\\n\r\nIt's irritating to look at, and see irrelevant characters suddenly become relevant again, and become as strong as two characters who have been sweating blood for years to get to the level that they are at right now. 17, the most irritating character in the whole Anime, Trunks (I already talked about him above, one of my favorite characters in Dragon Ball Z was handled very poorly here), Gohan, Frieza. All of these characters got magically stronger than Goku and Vegeta. Please don't even get me started on the sorry excuse of a character that is Kefla. Dragon Ball Z at least explained how the characters got stronger during it's run. \\n\\n\r\nOf course powerscaling is not the only problem that this Anime has. A lot of stuff that is counter-intuitive happens in Dragon Ball Super, retcons that don't make any sense. An example of this would be the potara earring fusion. The potara earring fusion was always known to be a permanent fusion, meaning that the two individuals who use the earrings and fuse together cannot defuse if they wanted to. Dragon Ball Super could have defused Vegito the same way it did with the Supreme Kai, by using the super dragon balls, but it just was not the case here with these lazy writers. After they fused, the Anime decided to disregard the last thirty years of Dragon Ball and just place a time limit on the potara fusion. The stupidest retcon anyone can think of, and it ruined the fusion dance for me, because what's the use of the fusion technique when the potara earrings can now diffuse? Other than this awful retcon, there were many unexplained things. What about Super Saiyan Rose, which was never explained? Why didn't Zamasu switch bodies with Jiren, who was leagues above Goku? These are just some examples in the endless sea of retcons, unexplained stuff and awful narrative decisions this Anime makes. \\n\\n\r\nI don't even want to talk about the Tournament of Power arc, which was by far the worst arc in all of Dragon Ball Super. The segments where they show the characters explaining everything that happens during the fights are the very definition of cringe. How are we supposed to be entertained or informed when the characters talk about the most obvious of things that are happening? The only thing the audience of Gods and Angels talks about is how much stronger a character has gotten, or how a character is beating another character and is winning, that's it. You would think that they would give explanations to things that need an explanation, since they were cramming this much dialogue into the show, but they don't. Why not just let the fight play out as it should be without interrupting it every ten seconds? Are you that cheap, Toei Animation? Are you really that greedy that you can't even do one fight properly? Yeah, I know that Goku vs Jiren was a thing, but that was towards the very end of that arc, when Toei had already made ten times what they were hoping for. If you are going to not explain all of the stuff you wrote, then you can at least not place the loads of pointless dialogue you placed during TOP. One or two good fights in an entire series of bad does not excuse all of this. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis Anime is an obvious disrespect to Dragon Ball Z, and it is a shameless cash grab done by Toei Animation so that they can make more money. This whole Anime was made to sell merchandise of the various forms that Goku and Vegeta obtain throughout all of it's run, it was not made to please the fans of the franchise. The feel of Dragon Ball is just gone here. Dragon Ball was great for it's time, it is still clearly memorable and the most popular Anime in the world, so a reboot was not necessary at all. But what do I know? Toei Animation owns the rights to the two most popular Anime on the planet, so clearly they are doing something right. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, if you haven't for some odd reason seen this, then I advise you to just not watch it. Go watch or rewatch Dragon Ball Kai if you want to see Dragon Ball. Or go watch some of the Dragon Ball Z or Super movies. Both are much better use of your time.",

            "content": "Dragonball super is among the worst animes I have ever seen. I strongly recommend you to not even start watching this crap. I honestly think that this show slowly ruins the reputation of Dragonball. In the following I will present you my reasons why I absoulte hate this show.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThe first two arcs of this anime are nothing else than retellings of the Battle of Gods and Fukatsu no F movies. If you have seen the movies the roughly first 30 episodes are completely pointless. On top of that they dragged the events out for the worse. Therefore the pacing in the first two arcsis just horrible. (1/10)\\n\r\nThe Universe 6 arc is a little bit better but still nothing special and complete trash in comparison to the Tournaments we had back in the Original Dragonball. It's obvious that the creators didn't put much thought in the designs of the Universe 6 participants. The fights are mostly uninteresting and lack tension. (3/10) \\n\r\nThe Black Goku arc started out promising at first but in the end it was just as bad as the previous arcs. Especially the ending is full of aspulls and it has one of the worst conclusion to an arc I have ever seen. (3/10)\\n\r\nAnother thing that really bothers me is that you really can't tell anymore how strong a character is, it all just makes no sense anymore. I know that DBZ to an extent especially in the Buu saga suffered from this problem as well, but in Super it's just gotten completely out of hand.\\n\r\nAll in all the story lacks tension and for the majority of it it's uninteresting and the writing is just horrible considering the amounts of asspuls throughout of it. Sure there were some episodes that were individually good but as a whole every arc was pretty bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really just pathetic. Just from that you can tell the creators don't give a fuck about this series. We live in 2017 and this trash is what they give us. Even compared to Dragonball and Dragonball Z it sucks bad and they were released more than 20 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special, pretty average. But still a huge step down from Db and Dbz which had amazing soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nHoneslty this is by far the worst aspect of the show. Every character has become a parody of themselves. Almost none of the characters acts the way they should. Videl has pretty much lost all of her character traits. In fact now in Super you could replace her with any standard anime girlfriend and it wouldn't even matter. Chichi bitches in every scene she is shown. With Gohan they exaggerated it with this whole \"Not a fighter\" trait.\\n\r\nBut by far the most damage has been done to Vegeta and especially to our main character Son Goku. Even though in the Buu saga Vegeta admitted that Goku is the Number 1, now he just behaves the way he did before. After the Buu saga Vegeta became friends with Goku and you could see he matured. It's like he just regressed as a character. Goku on the other hand has become a complete retard, infact even his kid self wasn't this much of an idiot. In Z you could see that Goku matured. Even though he loved fighting there were other things as well he cared for like the well being of his family and friends. He was selfish in Z as well but he was always aware of it and took responsibility when he fucked up. In super on the other hand they took his retarded and selfish side and leveled them up to new heights. He really just became a parody of himself and it hurts since they are slowly ruining a character I always loved.\\n\r\nCharacters like Gohan, Piccolo, Yamacha, Tenshinhan etc barely get any screen time anymore. To be honest the only characters I think they didn't ruin is Bulma and maybe Goten and kid Trunks.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nBecause of all these flaws this show has I could barely enjoy it. I will be honest some episodes in between will be enjoyable if you turn off your brain, but most of the time even this won't help. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before I recommend you to just avoid this terrible excuse of a show. Even Dragonball GT as bad as it was, is good compared to this shit. If it woudn't be for the name Dragonball in the title, it would never become as popular as it is today. The characters, the story, the art just everything about this anime sucks and it's clear that the only purpose of this show is to make some fast money because people will watch it anyway no matter how bad it is since it's Dragonball.  \\n",

            "content": "Dragon Ball Super, the sequel of the popular Dragon Ball Z, is a show with very polarising opinions. Some people love it and others hate it. I'm going to say it's pretty good and will give it a 7/10.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story of Dragon Ball Super isn't very complicated. There is a villain who shows up and Goku and his friends need to defeat him or there is a tournament going on and Goku and his friends must find a way to win it. The first 2 arcs are the movies Battle of Gods and Resurrection 'F' retold, the 3rd arc is a universal tournament, the4th arc is about a mysterious enemy in Future Trunks' timeline and the 5th arc is a battle royale with 8 universes. The stories are quite simple, but can offer a lot of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation of the show in the first 2 arcs is very inconsistent. Some moments it's very bad and worth around a 3/10 and sometimes (more often in the later arcs) it's very good and worth a 9/10. I would recommend skipping the first 2 arcs and watching the movies Battle of Gods and Resurrection 'F' instead, if you can't stand bad animation (the first 2 arcs are episode 1-27). The major fights in the 3rd, 4th and 5th arc are often very well animated and deserve a 8/10 or higher. That's why the art and animation is overall worth a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the show is overall pretty good and the show has some great music (often in the major battles). Overall the soundtrack deserves a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThe characters in Dragon Ball Super are pretty simple. There's Goku who likes to fight and wants to keep getting stronger, there's Vegeta who's fighting for his Saiyan pride and you've got some new characters like Whis and Beerus. The characters are overall pretty simple, but can still be very likeable. Overall they deserve a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall the show was very enjoyable for me. The major fights were very fun or exciting to watch. Even some of the filler episodes in the series were very fun to watch, because of certain character interactions or a pretty good subplot. It was enjoyable enough for me to wait every week for a new episode to air. Overall this deserves a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 (6,8/10)\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super had its ups and downs, like problems with the animation at the start (which were luckily fixed later on), but was overall a very enjoyable show. If you've previously watched Dragon Ball Z, I would recommend to watch this series as well (although you could watch the movies and start at episode 28, if you can't stand bad animation). Overall I think the anime deserves a 7/10.",

            "content": "I was hyped when I heard that there would be a new Dragon Ball movie back in 2013. The anticipation to get tickets to the showing of Battle of Gods was crazy and the movie did not disappoint. The fluid animation and mix of action and comedy that people were calling a Dragon Ball - Dragon Ball Z hybrid left a very nice impression. When they announced Resurrection F, the hype train carried over full capacity. And again, the movie left a very nice impression, albeit not as strong due to the weak ending, but that's a point for another discussion.\r\nI had been hoping thatthe success of these two movies would inspire a full anime series, and surprisingly enough, my hopes were indeed not misplaced. However, at the time I should have known better.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Dragon Ball Super, Toei's latest endeavor into further cementing why they are one of the worst studios of all time. Never in my life have I seen a more BLATANT cashgrab attempt than through this series. The first two arcs were just drawn out versions of the events that took place during the movies. Many believed that this would allow the plots of the two movies to be more fleshed out and pragmatic but they couldn't be more wrong. The pacing and animation were inconsistent and at times, god awful. The writing has been a weak point for this series post Dragon Ball so nothing new here in Super. The only redeeming qualities I found were the cast and the comedy, but you can only go so far with banter and antics in a partly action battle shounen, much less the sequel of Dragon Ball Z. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the next arc was quite interesting as it provided a solid extension and insight as to how exactly everything worked in the Dragon Ball universe and fleshed out many aspects that were introduced in the beginning of the series as they showcased this mini tournament between universes. Again however, this was hampered by Toei's signature inconsistent animating and poor pacing. Overall though, not so bad.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the good impressions as to the direction of this anime was heading was immediately smashed once the next arc started to pan out. The premise, at first, was very promising with the return of future Trunks, and the enemy this time being a little bit more than your typical DB monster/alien villain however things had started to go south very quickly. I found myself watching one empty episode after the last every week. Pointless fights, ridiculously inconsistent power scaling, a plot riddled with more holes than H&M jeans, and absolutely no direction in the directing. It was as if the animators weren't given a script at all and were just animating whatever they wanted and slapped it together. Suffice to say, I did not enjoy it at all. I was waiting for things to pick up but they never seemed to do so. This week's episode 67 was the final nail in the coffin. I can say with certainty that it was the worst conclusion to a story arc that I have ever seen out of any source of media or entertainment, anime or otherwise. It has thoroughly convinced me that this show has become a parody of itself. There is no other way I can simply fathom them putting out such an abomination into the world with their names included in the end credits, not even as an attempt at making a quick profit.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of Dragon Ball I am simply ashamed. This was indeed an even worse follow up than GT, and it makes me fear for what is to come in the future for this show. I am praying that someone in that office wakes up and realizes how much damage they are doing to this series.\\n\\n\r\n------------------\\n\\n\r\n3/20/18 edit:\\n\\n\r\nIt looks as if they refused to fix the gigantic plot hole at the end of that episode 67 I mentioned. Rather they used it to shoehorn the plot even further into the garbage. With that series finale but I can say with certainty that at this point the only reason you'd want to watch this series is if its nostalgia filled motivation. Newcomers looking for a battle shounen, look elsewhere. This is 131 episodes of time padding, repetitive, discontinuous, rubbish.",

            "content": "After being hyped for a while I caught up with the anime today, and decided to write a review because...why not. Being a hardcore DB fan in the past, I was really excited to get a canon continuation of DBZ, but...\r\nStory: 2\r\nThe story gets a 2 because the anime is so far a rehash of the two movies that came out, Battle of Gods and Resurrection of F. The only difference is the awful pacing this time. You're better off watching both movies and skipping what I reckon will be 30 episodes of the anime. The storylines themselves aren't anything to write home about either.\r\nAlso,speaking of DBZ, one can't help but bring up powerlevels. There're a lot of inconsistencies here. One example, one of Friezan's new henchmen is supposed to be stronger than the old Ginyu force (confirmed with a scouter), which means that even Goten should be able to wreck him without any effort, let alone Piccolo, Tien, Krillin, or freaking Gohan. \\n\\n\r\nYet he proceeds to solo EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM without any effort at the same time. Seriously? Piccolo in the original DBZ was fighting Frieza's second form to a stalemate and he's gotten a lot more powerful than that by Cell Saga, going toe to toe with 17, and first form Cell, and then even more powerful in the Buu Saga. Getting wrecked by a guy at Ginyu's level or so (hell, or even double, triple, quadruple that) was ridiculous to watch. Facepalm.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3\\n\\n\r\nArt gets a 3 because it's bad. Scenes which were copied from the movies look spectacular (since the movies are high quality) but everything else looks absolutely terrible, and for no reason at all. TOEI has the budget, they're simply lazy it seems. Anyone who's used to the awesome, detailed, perfectly proportioned character models from DBZ which could be used as wallpapers, will notice the terrible drawings right away. Couldn't help but getting bothered by it and asking why.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\\n\r\nSound gets a 3. DB is probably the only anime which is better in english DUB than SUB, but I watched the SUB nonetheless. The Goku-granny needs to go. Sure, nostalgia goggles and whatnot...but it's just not right. Goku being as old as he is...it's just not right when he sounds like a kid or a woman. Better stick with the ENG DUB.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings, although catchy, are a total mismatch for the series. I'd rather have badly remixed versions of the old openings than this. The OST in the anime is practically nonexistant. I noticed only a couple of musical pieces that play here and there, easily forgettable. They contribute nothing to the excitement of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  5\\n\\n\r\nCharacters get a 5. Goku is pretty much the same, Vegeta is a lot less hostile than before, Whis is a joke and plot device, but the worst thing about the anime has got to be Beerus. I actually liked Beerus in the movies. Sure, he had his idiotic and playful side, but it was also pretty obvious that he was somebody who KNEW STUFF, somebody who was above our heroes in terms of knowledge and wisdom, befitting of his age. \\n\\n\r\nBut this Beerus in the anime acts like a spoiled ass for absolutely no reason at all. Sure, that makes him a tad scarier, knowing you can't reason with him, but after a certain point, all that gets thrown out the window in a moment's notice, and he turns a companion? That's bad. Facepalm.\\n\\n\r\nMoving into the Frieza part of the anime, Frieza is satisfying, truly evil, angry and really crazy. He's awesome, but in true DBZ fashion, characters who are pissed off and have sworn to kill each other, stop in the middle of the battle in order to talk about who fights whom first, and tell each other to wait for power ups/transformations. \\n\\n\r\nReally??? That might be alright in Beerus' case, since he wanted to fight a strong opponent,and was actively searching for one, and maybe for Frieza in the past who was simply arrogant coz he had never lost a fight, but THIS Frieza? One moment he's fuming with anger about everything he went through in HELL, then he's torturing someone for sadistic pleasure until his nemesis arrives, and when said nemesis does arrive, he's chitchatting with him over pointless stuff. The one guy whom he'll do ANYTHING TO SEE DEAD FOREVER. Ridiculous. Facepalm.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this is a dreadful series and less enjoyable than anything that came before it. Watch the Battle of Gods and Resurrection of F movies, and skip this anime altogether. Not really worth it. At least not yet. Maybe once they're done with rehashing the movies...\\n",

They drag out unnecessary scenes over the whole episodes. They try to drag out anything to stall time so they can find a story to animate. The animation is bad, it's clean but bad. Poor camera angels mixed with poor animation and you have a dragon ball super fight. Fight scenes have nothing with them except for punching and kamehameha's. fighting choreography is close to none.  I heard that the animators for dragonball super are new to animation and is just beginning to animate. And you can see how little the creator of dragon balls care about it. Dragon balls used to be a an anime like one punch man, you weren't really there for the story just more for the raw power fights. But it has really gone downhill. If you have watched all the other dragon balls and is wondering if this is worth watching, my answer to you is no. Do not watch it, it will ruin everything you liked about dragon balls\\n",

Cant stay silent when someone butchers a legendary series with a cheap cash-grab.\r\n Not sure where to start so..i'll start with positives, as its whole 2/10 so got to have some, right? Ok. Positives: opening. End of positives.\r\nReally. It looks ok, music isnt terrible...\r\nProblems begin when the opening ends and show starts. Its one of the ugliest series i've seen in YEARS. It looks worse than DB, DBZ ang GT. Can't stop wondering why - dragon ball shits golden eggs for years, so i expected level of FSN: UBW, Naruto Shippuden, One PunchMan and other fighting series we see nowadays. Actually, i'd be happy even with the quality presented in the opening.  But this is straight bad. Characters, backgrounds, effects... everything looks cheap and amateur. Cut-scenes in DB games look better. \\n\r\nLet's continue. Story. It's on a whole different level of bullshit than GT. First of all, its inconsistent with regular DBZ. Examples? Beerus popping out of nowhere, then its further explained that if kaioshins die, he vanishes too. Where was he when Buu was butchering kaioshins? Or in latest events of buu saga when last 2 kaioshins could be annihilated any second? OK, lets say he could pop in a second and 1shot buu...i wont even start with golden freeza, and those random characters with random abilities in tournament, the most unfitting characters in DB World. The future trunks saga is when it totally breaks any logic that was introduced in DBZ. Trunks going back in time created alternative future, events splitted. In 1 continuum goku lives, in other he's dead for good. Then how the heck this joke-of-a-kaioshin from trunks continuum got to know goku and create black in his image, if goku died of disease before anyone knew about beerus and other universes, so if he was dead i guess he couldnt visit the other universe. But fck logic, right? And more problems popup with every episode.\\n\r\nI dont really know japanese, so cant talk about dubbing. Characters sound ok, i like beerus voiceactor. \\n\r\nI kept watching hoping for improvement, end with each episode it was only getting worse and worse and worse and worse....i finally gave up and wont be trying it again. Better to rewatch DBZ remaster next time...",

            "content": "After having watched 69 episodes, I think I can fairly assess whether this story is worth your time or not: it isn't. For the biggest part of the series it really isn't worth it, but there are some small parts which hardcore Dragonball fans might want to see anyway, which is why in addition to reviewing this series, I'll write a how to watch guide too.\r\nLet's start with the Story first.\r\nThe 1st and 2nd episode details where our heroes are and what they're doing after the Buu-saga. FANS CAN WATCH EPISODES 1 AND 2, BUT IT ISN'T NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE STORY.\r\nThen the real storystarts. And it's bad. There's no way around it. The first two arcs of the story is a re-hash of the movies, except each movie is stretched out to fit one arc, causing the story to drag, and this is done for no reason other than to cynically fill the air time and milk the cash cow. The movies are done way better. FANS OF THE DRAGONBALL FRANCHISE SHOULD SKIP EPISODE 3-14 AND WATCH \"BATTLE OF GODS\" INSTEAD. \\n\r\nEpisodes 15-19 are filler.\\n\r\nEPISODES 20-27 IS \"RESURRECTION F\", SKIP THIS AND WATCH THE MOVIE.\\n\r\nFrom episode 28 on, we get to see actual original content. The first arc, didn't much impress me, although there were some chuckle worthy moments here and there, it was pretty much standard tournament fare. FANS WHO LIKE WATCHING DRAGONBALL'S QUIRKY MARTIAL ARTS TOURNAMENTS SHOULD WATCH EPISODES  28-41, BUT SKIP EPISODE 30, WHICH IS A RECAP. OTHERWISE, WATCH EP28 (INTRODUCES NEW CHARACTERS) AND EP31 & EP41 (INTRODUCES NEW CONCEPTS), AND SKIP EVERYTHING ELSE.\\n\r\nEpisodes 41-43 are filler.\\n\r\nNext a new mini arc that's kicked off by Trunks and Goten. Again, some quirky humor and chuckles, but nothing great to write home about. Except for the very ending of episode 46, which introduces the next arc. FANS OF TRUNKS AND GOTEN CAN WATCH EPISODES 44-46 IN ITS ENTIRETY, OTHERWISE SKIP EVERYTHING UNTIL THE LAST 10 MINUTES OF EPISODE 46.\\n\r\nThe next arc, which is the Black arc, was very entertaining... despite its plot holes. For some reason, I really liked the villain, and his attitude; he was probably the best thing about the entire super series. Actually, he might be the ONLY good thing about this series... THIS ARC, RUNNING FROM EPISODE 47-67, IS THE REASON YOU SHOULD BE WATCHING SUPER, IT'S THE ONLY LEGITIMATELY ENTERTAINING THING ABOUT THIS SERIES.\\n\r\nEpisode 68 is filler, and episode 69 is filler with a crossover to Toriyama's other manga and stuffed with visual gags. Neither impressed me. IF YOU LIKE DR SLUMP AND ARALE-CHAN, WATCH EPISODE 69.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to Art. It should have improved over its 80s and 90s counterpart considering the availability of new technology, but instead it's WORSE. And not just a little, but A LOT worse. If your modern animation looks worse than the aged counterpart, then something's definitely gotta be wrong here. Sailor Moon Crystal knew this and brushed up their 3rd season, but Dragonball Super... not so much.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Sound, there's nothing wrong with it, but there's nothing great about it either. I was not blown from my chair. The fifth ED does like to get stuck in my head for some reason though, so that probably a plus point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are dreadful. Everything you knew and loved about your characters is made into a gag or exaggerated. Whatever growth they had experienced in the previous two series is gone. The characters have basically become a parody of themselves and are annoying. TV Tropes would call this flanderization. The only interesting character is the villain from the Black arc, and that says a lot about this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment can pretty much only be found in the Black arc. The rest is mediocre to terrible drivel.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series rests upon the shoulders of one character, and that character is the villain of one arc. The rest is just not that interesting and sometimes even downright terrible.",

            "content": "**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS**\r\nReview in English and Spanish/Rese\u00f1a en ingles y espa\u00f1ol.\r\nReview of all Dragon Ball Super up to chapter 131\r\nLet's go in parts, EVERYTHING DBS does is wrong.\r\nThey started adapting the 2 movies, although supposedly it was to correct mistakes, but in both they put events like that of Tagoma (I think that's what it was called), leaving him alive, with a pseudo motivation so that later Ginyu will arrive and steal the body and equal Ginyu Dies, making all this irrelevant, there were scenes in the film that lasted with 5 minutes and the series extended them to 2 chapters, being that1 film can be summarized in up to 4 chapters.\\n\r\nThe bow of the tournament seemed to me the worst of all, leaving aside that you do a tournament with 2 guys who have the power of a god, wasted all the others, Piccolo valued cock with a strategy stupid, being that in Z type If he thought well, Gohan had said that he would train and here he does not appear, Majin Buu, bone, be extremely strong and leave with a nonsense that can not enter because he can not write ... Equal Vegeta and Goku beat everyone, 5 vs 5 something very strange or unnecessary, then this Frost, conveniently showed us that he is a good subject and such nonsense, being that in the previous fight did not do the same with Botamo, but hey, then it turns out he is bad and I do not know what . Hit, the kind of 1000-year-old who can stop time, who overcomes the power of Goku and Vegeta, being both have the power of the gods (and included in a higher phase), the god level is so mediocre that it can be reached And overcome by anyone? And worst of all, the Kaioken * 10, with that mother should have killed Hit by just touching it, but no, and even loses ... Then comes the twist comic plot with Monaka and Bills also fulfilling the desire of Champa, Making the whole saga a nonsense.\\n\r\nIn the saga of black the most salient are that they went all over the ass with powers, like Black saying that because he has the body of a Saiyan he gets stronger every time he fights, but Genkai saiyan works only when they hurt you Gravity and you recover and not of cina you will raise the power of a ssj1 to that of a ssjdssj, Trunks and its deus ex machina supreme, first holding battles with Black and Zamasu, being that both gave to a pump to Goku and Vegeta in mode Blue, then acquiring an aura similar to that of the gods because I do not know, his sword resists a chingo (Although of course, in Z his sword could cut Freezer, the most powerful race at the time, but not 2 humans with part Robotic), it is obvious that Vegetto was just to attract more publicity and it's okay, I would not care so much if they did not leave the pothara union as worthy dick as the dance, all that was a Plot Device for which Trunks (which inexplicably Said that he would defeat Zamasu, being that Vegetto at that moment was giving him a slap), then generates that \"Genkidama\" with energy of the earth and a population fucking REDUCED (With energy of Goku and Vegetas done shit and in base mode), Being that to kill Buu was necessary a Genkidama universal and equal Buu resisted, it does not make sense that Zamasu to die so easy, but GOD EX MACHINA + GARY STU = Trunks. Many say that humans guided their energy and hope to Trunks and so they did not raise their hands, well, when they learned to master / control their Ki? One very important thing would be that Vegetto in ssjdssj should destroy the earth with the shock wave in one fell swoop, is a fucking OP character, but when he launches the Final Kamehameha the UNIVERSE should have been worth dick, but nothing happens to the earth. Previously they made the conveniences subtle, but now everyone noticed (Although good, 80% of fans complain about the duration of the merger, this being the least important compared to all other inconsistencies in the chapter). Trunks defeated Cell and the Androids \"Yes, because I TRAIN quite and its power was not so far from an inperfecto cell or the androids. It might be good that Trunks will defeat Zamasu but not with something so forced.\\n\\n\r\nThis saga in specific was to attract more public, I know several people who did not see DBS but started to see this saga, Akira should be counting his money while laughing at his fans.\\n\\n\r\nDbz also had very stupid mistakes, mainly in the saga of the androids and cell, but they were more subtle, DBS is so bad that even the PLEBS can notice that everything is wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThis last arc improved a little bit, since from the beginning there was a change in the color palette that made it no longer look all stiff and was more pleasing to the eye.\\n\r\nOne of the most notorious things about the tournament is the lack of originality in the characters, not only in design but also in skills, almost everything was reduced to hits instead of strategies or even interesting techniques.\\n\r\nRoshi, Krillin and Tenshinhan have their own chapters where they are given a little time on screen, Roshi being the most interesting and Tenshinhan the most boring.\\n\r\nIt is impossible not to notice the stupidities of the writers when supposedly important things happen, for example, when Frost was going to eliminate Roshi, Goku was like an idiot screaming and could not escape ... The guy is a god and to top it off he has teleportation ! This happens very often.\\n\r\nA very annoying thing is the emotional manipulation to eliminate a universe that we know absolutely nothing (literally), put phrases and sad melodies, being that they did not have the ability to make us care as spectators.\\n\r\nOnly one universe behaved credibly by being eliminated, acting scared and desperately trying not to be eliminated.\\n\r\nSaiyan girls are one of the worst things in the franchise, being a Mary Sue full-fledged, acquiring powers removed from the ass and extremely stupid transformations (Broly, WITHOUT SENSE) to then carry out the fusion Pothara that seemed to be even stronger that Vegetto.\\n\r\nHit is eliminated for being stupid.\\n\r\nVegeta takes a meaningless transformation out of his ass for a super cheap drama that even he does not believe himself.\\n\r\nHit and his past 3 minutes of unnecessary exposure are something that is not even worth talking about.\\n\r\nUltra instinct, ultra improved instinct, ultra Jiren instinct, all are power ups taken from the ass.\\n\r\nThe end with 17 reviving all the universes was too predictable but it's funny to see how it arrives 18 and says \"But 17, and you travel with your family?\" Dialogues so stupid that break the immersion.\\n\r\nFrieza the revived and apparently continue the story with the Resurrection of Frieza 4.0.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the first two arcs are the movies made even worse and unnecessarily lengthened, the first tournament of universes is a nonsense for that horrible final and has too many power ups nonsense that even they respect, the saga of Black is undoubtedly the worst , having 10 inconsistencies with Z and even with the same Super per chapter and the tournament improving a little but without being something remarkable.\\n\r\nAnimation of shit carried by animators who seem not to strive, there were only a few caps where there really was fluency and good drawing.\\n\r\nThe OST is not particularly noteworthy but has a good track record.\\n\r\nThe choreography of combat is terrible, showing only one or two planes, reducing everything to blow hit with limited animation, to be a shounen of fights this is very bad.\\n\r\nWas not this supposed to show what happened to reach the epilogue of Z?\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nRese\u00f1a de todo Dragon Ball Super hasta el capitulo 131\\n\r\nVayamos por partes porque todo en Dbs es un error.\\n\r\nDbs inicio con rehacer las pel\u00edculas, supuestamente para corregir fallos, pero en ambas ponen sucesos como lo e Tagoma (creo que as\u00ed se llamaba), dej\u00e1ndolo vivo, con una pseudo motivaci\u00f3n para que luego llegar\u00e1 Ginyu y se robara el cuerpo e igual Ginyu muere, haciendo todo esto irrelevante, hab\u00eda escenas en la pel\u00edcula que duraba con 5 minutos y la serie los alargo hasta a 2 cap\u00edtulos, siendo que 1 pel\u00edcula se puede resumir hasta en 4 cap\u00edtulos.\\n\r\nEl arco del torneo me parec\u00eda el peor de todos, dejando de lado que hagas un torneo con 2 tipos que tienen el poder de un dios, desaprovecharon a todos los dem\u00e1s, Piccolo valiendo verga con una estrategia bien pendeja, siendo que en Z el tipo si pensaba bien, Gohan hab\u00eda dicho que entrenar\u00eda y aqu\u00ed ni aparece, Majin Buu, osea, pinche ser extremadamente fuerte y salen con una tonter\u00eda de que no puede entrar porque no sabe escribir... Igual Vegeta y Goku vencen a todos, haciendo el 5 vs 5 algo muy extra\u00f1o o innecesario, luego esta Frost, convenientemente nos mostraron que es un buen sujeto y esas tonter\u00edas, siendo que en la pelea anterior no hicieron lo mismo con Botamo, pero bueno, luego resulta que es malo y no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9. Hit, el tipo de 1000 a\u00f1os que puede detener el tiempo, que supera el poder de Goku y Vegeta, siendo que ambos tienen el poder de los dioses (e inclusos en una fase superior), el nivel dios es tan mediocre que puede ser alcanzado y superado por cualquiera? Y lo peor de todo, el Kaioken*10, con esa madre deber\u00eda de haber matado a Hit con solo tocarlo, pero no, e incluso pierde... Luego llega el plot twist c\u00f3mico con Monaka y a Bills cumpliendo igualmente el deseo de Champa, haciendo a toda la saga con un DESPROPOSITO.\\n\r\nEn la saga de black lo mas resaltable son que se pasaron todo por el culo con los poderes, como Black diciendo que porque tiene el cuerpo de una Saiyan se hace mas fuerte cada vez que pelea, pero el Genkai saiyan funciona solo cuando te hieren de gravedad y te recuperas y ni de co\u00f1a te subir\u00e1 el poder de un ssj1 a el de un ssjdssj, Trunks y sus deus ex machina supremos, primero sosteniendo batallas con Black y Zamasu, siendo que ambos le dieron una putiza a Goku y Vegeta en modo azul, luego adquiriendo un aura similar a la de los dioses porque Yo No S\u00e9, su espada resiste un chingo (Aunque claro, en Z su espada pod\u00eda cortar a Freezer, la raza mas poderosa en su momento, pero no a 2 humanos con partes roboticas), es obvio que lo de Vegetto fue solo para atraer mas publico y esta bien, no me importar\u00eda tanto si no dejaran a la uni\u00f3n pothara tan vale verga como la danza, todo eso fue un Plot Device para que Trunks (El cual inexplicablemente dijo que derrotar\u00eda a Zamasu, siendo que Vegetto en esos momentos le estaba dando una putiza), luego genera esa \"Genkidama\" con energ\u00eda de la tierra y una poblaci\u00f3n jodidamente REDUCIDA (Con energ\u00eda de Goku y Vegetas hechos mierda y en modo base), siendo que para matar a Buu fue necesaria una Genkidama universal e igual Buu se resisti\u00f3, no tiene sentido que Zamasu muera tan f\u00e1cil, peeeeeeeero DEUS EX MACHINA+GARY STU=Trunks. Muchos dicen que los humanos guiaron su energ\u00eda y esperanza hacia Trunks y por eso no levantaron sus manos, bien, cuando aprendieron a dominar/controlar su Ki? Una cosa muy importante seria que Vegetto en ssjdssj deber\u00eda de destruir la tierra con la onda expansiva de un solo golpe, es un personaje jodidamente OP, pero cuando lanza el Final Kamehameha el UNIVERSO debi\u00f3 valer verga, pero a la tierra no le pasa nada... Anteriormente hac\u00edan las conveniencias medio sutiles, pero ahora todos lo notaron (Aunque bueno, el 80% de los fans se quejan de la duraci\u00f3n de la fusi\u00f3n, siendo esto lo menos importante a comparaci\u00f3n con todas las dem\u00e1s incoherencias del capitulo) \"El futuro debe ser arreglado por alguien de ese futuro, por eso Trunks derroto a Cell y a los Androides\" Si, porque ENTRENO bastante y su poder no estaba tan alejado de un cell imperfecto o los androides. Pudo ser bueno que Trunks derrotar\u00e1 a Zamasu pero no con algo tan forzado.\\n\r\nEsta saga en especifico fue para atraer a mas publico, aunque todo lo que trajo son PLEBS y elitistas a los que les dan un muy buen material para echarle mierda.\\n\\n\r\nEste ultimo arco mejor\u00f3 un poquito, ya desde el principio se vio un cambio en la paleta de colores que hacia que ya no se viera todo acartonado y era mas agradable a la vista.\\n\r\nUna de las cosas mas notorias del torneo es la falta de originalidad en los personajes, no solo en dise\u00f1o sino tambi\u00e9n en habilidades, casi todo se reduc\u00eda a golpes en lugar de estrategias o t\u00e9cnicas siquiera interesantes.\\n\r\nRoshi, Krillin y Tenshinhan tienen sus propios cap\u00edtulos donde se les da un poco de tiempo en pantalla, siendo Roshi el mas interesante y Tenshinhan el mas aburrido.\\n\r\nEs imposible no notar las estupideces de los escritores cuando pasan cosas supuestamente importantes, por ejemplo, cuando Frost iba a eliminar a Roshi, Goku estuvo como idiota gritando y seg\u00fan no pod\u00eda escapar... El tipo es un dios y para colmo tiene la teletransportaci\u00f3n! Esto ocurre muy seguido.\\n\r\nUna cosa muy molesta es la manipulaci\u00f3n emocional al eliminar a un universo del que no conocemos absolutamente nada (literalmente), ponen frases y melod\u00edas tristes, siendo que no tuvieron la capacidad de hacer que nos importe como espectadores.\\n\r\nSolo un universo se comport\u00f3 de una manera cre\u00edble al ser eliminado, actuando asustados y tratando desesperadamente de que no los eliminaran.\\n\r\nLas ni\u00f1as Saiyan son una de las peores cosas de la franquicia, siendo unas Mary Sue hechas y derechas, adquiriendo poderes sacados del culo y transformaciones sumamente est\u00fapidas (Broly, SINSENTIDO) para luego llevar a cabo la fusi\u00f3n Pothara que parec\u00eda ser incluso mas fuerte que Vegetto.\\n\r\nHit es eliminado por ser un est\u00fapido.\\n\r\nVegeta se saca del culo una transformaci\u00f3n sin sentido por un drama super barato que ni \u00e9l mismo se cree.\\n\r\nHit y su pasado de 3 minutos de exposici\u00f3n innecesaria son algo de lo que ni siquiera vale la pena hablar.\\n\r\nUltra instinto, ultra instinto mejorado, ultra instinto de Jiren, todos son power ups sacados del culo.\\n\r\nEl final con 17 reviviendo a todos los universos era demasiado predecible pero da gracia ver como llega 18 y dice \"Pero 17, y tu viajo con tu familia?\" Di\u00e1logos tan pendejos que rompen la inmersi\u00f3n.\\n\r\nFreezer el revivido y aparentemente continuar\u00e1 la historia con la Resurrecci\u00f3n de Freezer 4.0.\\n\\n\r\nEn general, los dos primeros arcos son las pel\u00edculas hechas aun peor y alargada innecesariamente, el primer torneo de universos es un desprop\u00f3sito por ese horrendo final y tiene demasiados power ups sinsentido que ni ellos mismos respetan, la saga de Black es sin duda la peor, teniendo 10 incoherencias con Z e incluso con el mismo Super por capitulo y el torneo mejorando un poquito pero sin ser algo destacable.\\n\r\nAnimaci\u00f3n de mierda llevada por animadores que parecen no esforzarse, solo hubo unos pocos caps donde realmente hubo fluidez y buen dibujo.\\n\r\nEl OST no es particularmente destacable pero tiene una que otra buena pista.\\n\r\nLa coreograf\u00eda de combate es p\u00e9sima, mostrando solo uno o dos planos, reduciendo todo a golpe golpe con animaci\u00f3n limitada, para ser un shounen de peleas esto es muy malo.\\n\r\n\u00bfNo se supon\u00eda que esto era para mostrar lo que paso para llegar al epilogo de Z?",

            "content": "Ahhhh, Dragon Ball Super, the canon version of some weird fanfiction called Dragon Ball AF. Let's start!\r\n*Movie recaps: you can't start an anime with just a recap of the first two (bad) movies. It's feels more like filler and just a waste of time. The episodes are excessively long and the terrible animation is over the top.  EXAMPLE? Remember episode 5? The story is bad just like that movies. Retcons, asspulls, resurrections, lazy designs of 'new' transformations. 1/10\r\n*Super Tournament Arc: the reason of this Tournament makes no sense in the first place. Champa can gather the Super Dragon Balls without discuss with Bills. Iknow that fights are important here but at least give me a decent reason of why they are fighting! The worst part is that they are a disaster (asspulls, zero strategy). Piccolo is defeated by Frost because he was cheating, for that, he can't return. Goku is defeated for the same reason yet he can return!? Because is the MC, of course! The arc is just Vegeta and Goku vs Universe 6. The other characters are just wasted potential. Majin Boo can't enter because he failed to some written test? LMAO 2/10\\n\\n\r\n*Future Trunks Arc: they tried to give us a different villain there but as the arc  proceeds it becomes your sadist and standart villain. Zamatsu is highly hypocritical, he wants to kill all the mortals believing them to be the source of all evil. Yes, i got it! But you can do that with Super Dragon Ball that you had! Why do you slowly kill everybody!? The series tries (and fail) to sympathise with him but he is just a sadist! Almost all the scenes are bad: Trunks being just a Gary Stu (just look the ending of the battle!), repetive (so many time travels are just ridiculous!), asspulls, Goku Black have some unexplained and forced new transformation (also the desing is very lazy), Goku being more idiot than ever and they tried to establish  a weird and nonsense romance between Future Mai and Future Trunks LOL?! 2/10 (the only interesting scene was Future Zeno erasing all the universes).\\n\\n\r\n*Tournament of Power Arc (or the Tournament of Asspulls Arc): the most 'hyped' tournament! I know that Goku loves fighting but what he do is something antithetical here, everybody that loses this tournament will be erased by Zeno. Despite that, Goku doesn't care and just want to fight strong guys. This arc consists on two factors: no tension or forced tension. The first were in the first episodes of the arc and in the middle. It was supposed that everybody IN THE UNIVERSE will be killed if they lose yet many of them take the issue far too lightly. The second is the overdramatic episodes, many are scared that universe 7 will be erased! Nobody remeber the ending of Z? They are alive! There are some interesting subplots that were forgotten like Frieza plan in the tournament (nothing happens in the end). The fights are slightly better but the asspulls are still over the place again. The most clear example was Kefla (Caulifla and Kale fusion), she exists just to be owerpower and nothing more. And now, Jiren, is personality is all over the place. First, he is a calm guy that thinks before acting. Suddenly, after some generic and tragic flashback, he goes full fledged yandere for no reason! There is no consistency in anyway. Of course, the ending is just everybody reviving. I don't dislike so much this arc like the others, 17 and 18 were cool and very few fights scenes are decent. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of blood,  bad animation, retcons that ruined Z, the characters are just parodies of themselves, asspulls. Ehh, this series makes me ashamed to like Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. It hurts that a decent franchise was ruined just for the sake of money. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nFiller: 0/10\\n\\n\r\n2/10 overall. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Ifyou ever watched GT you'ed know that most of the conflicts in the anime  took place away from earth. But Gt spent entire episodes flashing out the planets goku and his crew went to. Super spends 4 minutes on each new planet and never comes back to them. This makes the universes in super feel shallow and void of life. \\n\\n\r\nIn short\\n\\n\r\nPuddle deep worlds, bad writing, shit animation, shallow and occasionally edgy characters, and a lot less screaming.

(GodTuber... im still laughing..) the arc of the battle between universe 7 warriors and universe 6 was well made as well, overall i really liked the storylines other then the first 2\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nas i mentioned its pretty awesome to see all the old characters and the old attacks and the old transformations with 2016 animation, its really well made\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\ni was never really sure what to put in the \"Sound\" section but if they are referring to the opening i really like it and the endings are pretty nice too but.. its a point of taste so... i dont know\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nwell i love Goku, Vegeta, Bulma, Trunks,Goten, Gohan, Chi-chi and all the rest, really i cant really add much since im assuming you do know at least a little bit but...\\n\r\nGoku- Goku is a simple character, he always was, he wants to battle for fun, he almost never gets serious in a battle but when he does he is awesome, he isnt much of a good parent and no matter how much i say here i cant say how much i love this guy\\n\r\nVegeta- the prince of saiyans, the most prideful character you will ever see, always looking to beat Goku to prove that he is the strongest\\n\r\nwell these are pretty much the main ones (in my opinion)\\n\r\nbut bulma's sharp mind, chi-chi's motherly love, gohan's disappointing future, Beerus and Whis's love of food and Goten and Trunks's friendship make nice additions\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\noverall i really enjoy this show, im repeating myself but seeing all the old characters fight again is really nice\\n\\n\r\ni dont have much to add but i highly recommend you watch this anime (if you already saw Dragon Ball Z) i truly dont understand how the top review (in this time) with over 150 people who found it helpful is some guy who only watched 3 episodes and assumes what will happen in the anime (totally wrong by the way) \\n\r\nwow im really bad at making reviews, hope i helped whoever really read this",

There is zero suspense in Dragon Ball Super, and that was what made DBZ great; a strong villain that forced the characters to surpass their limits to protect their friends and family. DB super has none of that. It's just a snooze fest.\r\nIt is clear to me that Akira is just continuing the story just to make money, especially sincethe plot is even more lackluster than the Buu saga's plot. Super is much worse than Dragon Ball GT, and the worst part about it is that it's Canon! There isn't a single lick of creative writing going on in DB Super. Just the same re-hashed cliche anime stereotype about anime characters' lives revolving around when it's time to eat. The joke has gotten old. I don't think any real fan of DBZ will like this, and if they say they do, they are kidding themselves. \\n\\n\r\n***Some of the animation quality in this anime is seriously the worst I have ever seen. Nobody can deny how bad it gets. Just embarrassing. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict: DON'T WATCH THIS!!!!\\n\r\n2.5/10",

            "content": "Dragon Ball Super is the worst installment of the Dragon Ball franchise. When GT first came out, everyone thought it was the worst installment of the Dragon Ball franchise. Guess what, Dragon Ball Super is way worse than that. Following Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball Super is the sequel of Dragon Ball Z. If you are a fan of Dragon Ball Z and is looking for more content of Dragon Ball, don't waste your time, Dragon Ball Super is an outrageous disappointment.\r\nMost of the anime's arcs are just worse, budget versions of the movies. There is no extra content in the anime, so I wouldadvise you to watch the Dragon Ball Super movies rather than the anime. You would save a lot of time, and the movies are done in higher quality than the anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10\\n\r\nThe story is appalling, and the stakes are dreadfully low, every time the main characters get in a predicament, they suddenly obtain a new transformation and defeat the villain. Goku also forms a friendly relationship with the most powerful being in the multiverse, Zeno, so whenever the main characters are in trouble, they just summon Zeno and win. The amount of retcons and contradictions are ridiculous. Trunks suddenly gets a new unexplained transformation. Most of the arcs feel disconnected as well, it feels as if each arc is its own standalone story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 1/10\\n\r\nThe animation and art of Dragon Ball Super are ridiculously terrible. The fight scenes are riddled and littered with repeated animation, and that ruins most of the fights in Dragon Ball Super.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe sound is fair, in fight scenes, the music can enhance and improve your experience of Dragon Ball Super. Still, the music is nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nMost of the characters are flat, one-dimensional, and generally boring. Goku turns into a jerk, Vegeta turns into comedic relief, and most of the side characters do nothing and just appear in the background. Surprisingly, the most enjoyable characters are the newly introduced characters. I enjoyed Beerus and Whis, they were funny.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nSurprising, even with all its flaws, I somewhat enjoyed Dragon Ball Super. I wouldn't rewatch it by no means, but I didn't absolutely hate the time I spent watching Dragon Ball Super. After you overlook all of Dragon Ball Super's flaws, you can somewhat enjoy it. I view Dragon Ball Super as mindless entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10\\n\r\nYou can spend your time doing something more productive, or watching better anime, instead of watching Dragon Ball Super. If Dragon Ball Super was viewed critically, it will undoubtedly score extremely low.\\n",

            "content": "So this my overall Review of the anime Dragon Ball Super. I will talk about the story, art , sound , character, enjoyment  and then I make a conclusion to my review.\r\nStory\r\nSo basically the fist two arcs are retelling of the movie. I was not watching it weekly back then, when the episodes aired. I knew that there was a series but I was not sure if it was a weekly anime for new content. So I waited 1 year before I watched the episodes. I watched the episodes when it was in the Universe 6 Tournament.\r\nThe story was ok in the first twoarcs. They could deliver something with right power scaling. The 3rd arc had a nice story too. The problems started in the Goku black arc. I was first impressed of the writing. The thing with Zamasu and Goku Black were interesting. I hated how they did not explain how Trunks was able to use Mafuba again, the SSJ Rose thing or the final attack of Trunks. The writers made the ending weird for the Trunks arc. They let Trunks the win with a Genkidama sword that HE CREATED. But how did he learned this?? Never explained. They could have changed the ending that way: Goku makes the Genkidama and he let Trunks  absorb the Genkidama. Then Goku could have said to Vegeta to give Trunks the reserves of all of their power to boost his attack. That ending would be so cool. \\n\\n\r\nTHe real problem started in the Universe survival arc. There the writing collapsed completly to something that made no sense. (For example SSB Goku/Vegeta Final Kamehameha, Jirens backstory, Kefla being strong as SSJ God/Blue, Tiens writing, SSJ Blue spam...)\\n\\n\r\nThe reason was that the preproduction and the schedeule were tight. I come to that topic later.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe real issue that Toei animation did 2015 was to announce Dragon Ball super first and then start the production of the series. A series should need at least 7 months of preproduction. But it got 1-2 months of production time. So the art and storytelling suffered a lot from this. So the art suffered in the first two arcs dramatically. Because of that the series got a bad reputation for a long time. They used the first two arcs as a solution for the preproduction of the animie for the animating the 3rd and 4th arc of DB Super. These episodes were outsourced expensively with a big staff list that could not wrap the episodes good enough for a good art style especially in ithe R of F arc. But the art got better in the Goku Black arc and Tournament of Power. \\n\\n\r\nI do not like Yamamuros sheets for Dragon ball Super. They look so plastic and are not animation friendly. I hope Shintanis Sheets are used when DB Super comes back. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nthe Sound is in my opinion not suitable till the Goku Black arc. Its too soft till there. The tournament of Power got better sounds but I would prefer harsher music like in the English DBZ Dub. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nGokus Character was a lot of time so off. I dont know why, but I like a more serious Goku like in the Tournament of Power arc. They made the Character really weak, \\n\\n\r\nVegeta is really ilkable. He changed a lot. From a warrior who wanted evil intentions to a caring father, who is like a antagonist. I dont like that he does not get the win for once in DB general\\n\\n\r\nFrieza is my favourite Character. He was really weird in the 2nd arc but when he was introduced again he was greatly brought back. I like his new attitude. Better then the not thinking, revenge seaking attitude \\n\\n\r\nGohan is the worst handled character in all Super. I thought he could be useful in the ToP arc but he was handled reaaaaaallly bad. \\n\\n\r\nGoten and kid Trunks are really not useful in DB Super? No character progression or really making stories of them... I do like that kid Trunks is more involved with his future counterpart. But after that its really like the same like before.\\n\\n\r\nAndroid 17 is my MVP Character. Really well done in the anime Android 18 is a bit meh and I have mixed feelings about her.\\n\\n\r\nKrillin was handled really bad in the first half, then got more screentime in the ToP arc\\n\\n\r\nTien is really poor handled. I mean he only got relevance in the ToP arc and was dirty thrown out of the ring. After that he was just sitting there and said nothing the whole tournament??\\n\\n\r\nBeerus and Whis are likeable characters. Whis can do too much in my opinion. He can resurrect people from the dead and give birth? Come on...  The thing with the time makes sense but the all other things are just meh... Beerus and the other Gods of Destruction are interesting. I want to know more about them\\n\\n\r\nBulma is really funny and has a nice touch. I enjoyed her like Frieza.\\n\\n\r\nBuu as a character is weirdly done with the falling asleep. How they removed him from the list is really annoying every time!!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI do enjoy the episodes but it gets more foreshadowing what will happen next. The fights are not intense, because the choreography is a bit off for the most times and the music does not flow with the fight most of the times. Episode 130 was better handled but not as much as I hoped. I really miss strategy fights with exploiting weaknesses during a fight. I want the characters themself figure out weaknesses and not the crowd or someone other else. I miss the self monolouges the character have for defeating an enemy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nDue to the tight preproduction the anime is not worth to be called a very good anime. THe flaws in the choreography, art and Story makes the anime not the best. I believe if DB Super comes back everything will be better for sure. The characters should be better handled and should get relevance. The Sound of the DB Super Broly were the best. It should be used for the new anime if it comes back. Yamamuro should step back and other talents like Shintani shine. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Dragon Ball Super was a big letdown for me. All the Character Development from DBZ was thrown out the window, and characters are not who they used to be, leaving them as a shallow, stupid version of themselves that attempts to mimic the good parts of Z. \r\nAnimation:\r\nBy far the most appalling part of the show. First half of the anime looks awfully horrible. It sometimes looks fan animated. I will admit though, in the later parts of the anime, it does improve. Visually, not a good looking anime compared to any modern-day anime such as One Punch Man, which featured great visuals. The artstylewas very off-putting, usually the models were completely dumb-looking. On top of that, there is no blood at all, which has happened for censorship reasons, I suppose. Overall, DBS does anything visually not well at all.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nBland, sometimes outright dumb. Resurrection of F Arc was awful. Later Arcs are better, but still, the story lacks any deep connection or intensity to the core, like Z did. \\n\\n\r\nFiller:\\n\\n\r\nliterally the most enjoyable part of the show, lmao.\\n\\n\r\nTransformations:\\n\r\nAll of them were stupid and are only good for ridiculous and out of control power scaling. they lack intuitive or creative design. Seriously, Super Saiyan Blue is literally a recolor. and blue hair? seriously? Then there's Super Saiyan Rose. Pink hair. What's next? Looks like they've run out of colors to use. Guess we'll just give Goku some contacts and make his hair white! Seriously, these designs were all boring and stupid. The only good thing from GT was SSJ4, and at least that was done somewhat right.\\n\\n\r\nPower Scalings:\\n\\n\r\nCompletely ridiculous and stupid. At the end of the show, Goku can apparently destroy the universe in 3 punches. This... it's gone to damn far.. The writer thinks it's cool now, but i find it absolutely moronic. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nA big letdown for me. Animation pales in comparison to any other anime aired in the recent years. Story is bland and almost seems like a fanfic (Golden Freeza! Evil Goku!!! yaaaaaaaaaaaa!!11!!) Transformations are boring, stupid, and uncreative. Power scalings are just out of hand, now. \\n\\n\\n\r\n3/10. mostly cause this is the only anime I've found that I enjoyed the filler more than the actual story.",

            "content": "As someone who not unlike many of you, has been a fan of this franchise since longer than I could remember, believe me when I say that all I'm going to bring up here is from a place of love. I also want to say that, in spite of everything Dragon Ball Super was still at least an entertaining experience on some level but I can't use that as an excuse to ignore the disappoinment I've felt continuously with this series time and time again. \r\nWhen we look at the the first 27 episodes of Super, you can pretty much take anything nice I haveto say about the series and put in the dumpster since besides the odd filler episode here or there, their's next to no fun to be had with the retread stories of Battle of Gods and Resurrection F. I understand it was done in order to bridge the gap between the new storylines for those who hadn't seen the movies as well as retcon said movies in some handy ways (like how in this version, Beerus wasn't using any where close to 1% of his power to fight SSG Goku, forget 70%). But there's really no excuse in the world that could make a bad product good and these arcs only serve to fuel the most cynical of views towards a franchise that many would argue past it's prime decades ago. These two arcs were just ugly, slow, and didn't even bother to take the opportunity to fix what issues were already present in the movies.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough about low hanging fruit, let's look at what happened when Dragon Ball Super set out to do something original. Yes, the Universe 6 arc, the place that myself and likely many others consider the real beginning of Dragon Ball Super, and I'll say, it certainly was an improvement at the very least. Animation-wise it was still incredibly shabby in places and as a tournament arc it didn't exactly have very high aspirations and essentially no stakes. But at the very least we managed to get some actual decent fights in if nothing else, with Goku vs Hit setting the bar far higher than anything to that point. Beyond that we got a brand new storyline featuring everyone's blue(?)-haired time traveler Trunks and his ongoing fight with a now inexplicably evil version of Goku. It's probably the most unapologetically fanfic-ish premise to ever get greenlit that I've ever seen and the way the story bends over backwards to and explain how it all happens doesn't make a lick of sense, even by Dragon Ball standards. Plot-holes and dumb choices by characters are nothing new to the series as anyone whose ever really thought about any these stories for an extended period of time can attest to, but the ones here are incredibly distracting since the arc spends more of it's focus building up a mystery then any others. The ending they opted for with this arc was no less ridiculous and only further cemented this arc as nothing but superficially cool ideas with bafflingly stupid execution.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now we arrive at the Tournament of Power, which by my estimation, was easily the most fun story arc to follow by a country mile. The level of scale and the immediate stakes grab interest from the word \"go\" and the promise of seeing characters who haven't had anything to do for the longest time get some shine is something that the arc did an OK job of following up on (even if by doing so they managed to cause much confusion with anyone who at all cared about power scaling). I have no doubt that the vast majority of Super's best episodes came from this arc, but that doesn't make the overall structure of this arc good. The set-up for tournament itself was excessive for sure with nearly 20 episodes from the beginning off the arc focused on getting the gang together with not as much time spent on getting to know the other Universe's combatants as their could have been. A missed opportunity to try and get us invested in the stories of these off these other far off places. The actual event itself suffers from how the series rarely does anything interesting with the fact that this is an 80 person Royal Rumble. Sure their's no shortage of teamwork on display, but it never feels as if anything is happening besides the one or two fights that are the focus of the episode, even during many of the earlier episodes. It instead feels like an extended gauntlet match for Universe 7 to grind through. While the first few episodes manage to capture the appeal of what a fight like this could look like, it fizzles out from there. Most of the combatants may as well be sitting around picking their noses for all it matters. The endgame of the entire arc also falls flat thanks to Jiren being a strong contender for the worst antagonist in the entire series, someone who was hyped too soon only to lead to the reveal of a hollow personality/backstory and a lame moveset. Not to mention the transparent way he was made to look villainous when the spotlight was on him merely to make Goku look righteous by comparison, even though good/evil was never supposed to be a factor in a fight between entire Universe at risk of vanishing. I look at his character and see a hole poorly filled for another combatant more deserving, Hit. After all him and Goku already had a fun rivalry set-up between them and what better way to have it settled than on such a grand stage? Instead we got yet another addition in the miles long conga line of antagonists with power dwarfing the last and that's really it.\\n\\n\r\nPlease note that by pointing out problems here, I'm not suggesting that Z wasn't guilty any of the problems Super had. Not that it should matter either way but I've noticed that a lot fans of Super mischaracterize critics as people who \"thought it was OK when Z did it\". My point here isn't that Super created many wholely unique problems all on it's own since a good deal of what's wrong here was also an issue with Dragon Ball Z. The problem is nothing resembling what Z at least somewhat competent by today's standards is here beyond some good fights. There are no character arcs here that could hold a candle to what Z did with Vegeta and Gohan (they even went back and made Vegeta Goku's eternal rival again when he already put that part of himself to rest in Z), and besides Goku Black, Zamasu and I suppose Jiren towards the end, their weren't any truly detestable villains whose defeats we could come back each episode to look forward to. I respect how Super goes out of it's way to portray it's characters moreso as normal people during their downtime than Z did with how it shows characters in lifestyles that don't involve fighting for the sake of the planet/Universe but the low-key scenes and episodes only served to make me wish I was watching a chill slice-of-life spin-off than what we ended up getting.\\n\\n\r\nThis series frustrates me less for how bad it is, and more for how good I wanted it to be.",

            "content": "Strap yourselves in for an honest review of Dragon Ball Super!\r\nThis long-awaited continuation of the Dragon Ball franchise (following directly from Dragon Ball Z), Dragon Ball Super attempts to bring back our childhood excitement with brand new material from the original creator himself. However, being the follow-up to the extremely popular Dragon Ball Z, Super had big shoes to fill. Now I shall give my opinion on whether or not it did.\r\nStory:\t1.0 / 10\r\nSimply put: there is no story. Two arcs are movie retellings, two arcs are generic tournament arcs and the other arc has a story that doesn\u2019t even affect our main cast andends horribly. To be fair, Dragon Ball Z didn\u2019t have brilliant storylines either, they were primarily to set up entertaining fights. But every arc in Z at least had some sort of purpose. None of the arcs in Super have any impact, leave you thinking or wanting to know more. But do the fights make up for the lack of story? I will answer that in the \u201cEnjoyment\u201d section.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\t4.0 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is terribly inconsistent. The first 30-ish episodes look horrible, no other word for it. Many scenes from these early episodes are so badly animated that it put a lot of the community off of watching it any further at all. The animation does become great nearing the very end of the series, but that is only good enough to bring the overall visuals to below average for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\t6.0 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing exceptional. None of the songs were really memorable or exciting to me. The openings were also just something that I sat through because I had to. The action sounds were decent and the voices were fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\t0.4 / 10\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this is the category where Super completely dropped the ball. Not one of the characters have any sort of development. On the contrary, Goku is suddenly a much bigger idiot than he was before, Vegeta completely degrades to \u201cplaying catch-up to Goku\u201d (completely reversing his satisfying character arc from the end of Z) and Gohan cannot be decided on whether he should be a family-man or a badass fighter. All of the established character arcs are discarded and all of the characters become as bland and one-dimensional as possible. Even the character designs were slimmed down and became boring to look at. To me, the way that Super handled its characters made me want to drop the show entirely.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\t1.0 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy Super at all. On the contrary, Super made me ashamed to be a fan of the Dragon Ball franchise. I envy the people that can look past all of these problems and enjoy Super for the fights. The inconsistent animation, complete disregard for logic regarding transformations and power scaling, the bland characters and the tensionless fights all made it so that I enjoyed absolutely none of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\t\t2.0 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve made my point. Between the animation, bad characters, illogical writing and lack of story, I cannot honestly describe Super as anything but \u201chorrible\u201d. However, Super became a controversial topic to talk to my friends about, so I could at least take one good thing out of this experience.\\n",

            "content": "What keeps the Dragon Ball series alive is its gigantic fanbase that has developed ever since the 1990's. Dragon Ball Z is perhaps the father of shounen. Although, the amount of popularity for a source of entertainment doesn't necessarily always infer its quality. \r\nThe more serious of anime consumers have watched hundreds of anime and spent months watching anime. And by spending months, I mean literally 2000+ hours (that would be equivalent to watching anime 3 months straight without eating, sleeping, etc) worth of watching anime. With most of them critiquing anime seriously. \r\nBy contrast, you have reviewers on here, perhaps having little knowledge ofanime, giving Dragon Ball Super scores of 8/10 or 9/10. Needless to say, it would seem that they're Not dedicated towards fairly comprehending what constitutes something as a great work of art, and that is the process of inflating the value of good anime. \\n\r\nBy juxtaposition, I would gauge that the overall quality of Dragon Ball Super lies within the bottom third of all anime. \\n\\n\r\nThere is much to say about Dragon Ball Super. \\n\r\nIn Universe 7 (where our main characters are from), the fighters gathered for tournaments all come from Earth. The problem is that DBS doesn't feel like a living breathing world. Everything is bent and manipulated to place emphasis on the main cast. And unfortunately, it can't even do that. As we know that the main cast isn't just Goku and Vegeta, but those two are the only protagonists that are viable in battle. It'd be much better... rather than giving characters unreasonable power boosts just so that they can be somewhat relevant to the now immeasurably god-level characters... it'd be much better if Dragon Ball Super decided for moving on to explore potential characters that rival our main protagonists in terms of power and importance, with emphasis on importance.  \\n\r\nBecause while power levels are horrible, yes... at least the saving grace can still be for the characters to be well-written (development, depth, etc). Unfortunately, the writing of characters isn't on the same level as its predecessors. Endearing characters of old from DBZ have lost much of their flare and relevancy. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I really enjoyed Dragon Ball Z because it had many heartfelt moments (that I could name from the top of my head), Dragon Ball Super doesn't do anything great in its own right. It doesn't become a developed and improved version of its predecessor so that it could in-potential be an epitome of how great the Dragon Ball series is. And unfortunately, as nice as it is to see Goku and Vegeta strive to be the best, I am disappointed that Dragon Ball Super doesn't strive to be its best, if only at what it does.",

            "content": "Does anybody remember when Goku went Super Saiyan for the first time? It was on Namek, the whole arc had been building up Frieza as this impossibly strong monster, the Z Fighters had to fight tooth and nail just to defeat his lackies. The only reason we had to hope that Goku stood a chance was this mysterious term floating around about a \"Super Saiyan.\" Unless you were following the manga as it came out, you knew how it was going to go, Goku would go Super Saiyan and beat the alien tyrant in a classic case of good defeats evil. But, that's not howit goes. Sure, Goku unlocks the legendary power and is able to beat Frieza, but it's only after all the Namekians are dead, it was only after Vegeta had gone from unlikable prick to respectable anti-hero only to get unceremoniously pierced through the chest. It was only after Krillin, a character that had been with us since early in the original Dragon Ball, was dead, and as far as we knew at the time, he wasn't coming back. Goku going Super Saiyan wasn't a moment of masculine glory, it's just kind of sad. Even Goku recognizes this, one of his defining characteristics is a love for fighting, but he doesn't even want to finish the fight, Freiza is brought down with his own attack and Goku only finishes him off because he refuses to accept defeat. That's why this moment still resonates with people 30 years later, as many problems Dragon Ball Z had, be it horrible pacing or not aging well in other ways, DBZ at its core had heart and it deserves its place as a classic.\\n\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super has none of that. Every arc is the exact same; introduce a new rival, Goku gets a new form to fight them with, Goku loses because of some stupid reason like a time limit or he lets his guard down, but everything turns out fine anyway because we know how this is all going to end from the time skip in Z. There's never any tension, there's never any excitement, there's never any character development, all the plot twists feel contrived, the new plot elements are hit or miss, and most of the time it is just boring to watch because while the technology has improved, their animation style hasn't been updated in 3 decades. All in all, this show is a painful waste of time designed to prey on nostalgia for a much better series.",

            "content": "This review takes all the Dragon ball series into account, including all the anime and all the movies/OVAs.\r\nNo need to introduce Dragon Ball, it's with no doubt the most known manga ever. Not only it keeps running despite being 30 years-old or more, it's also a perfect concept for kids: colorful, epic, memorable, funny.\r\nSadly, the anime version doesn't deserve any more praise than that. In the manga, the art was good but the story was shit most of the time ; in the anime, the art is way worse and it keeps the original messed-up story, which gives a show full of flaws that can'tbe denied.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nYes, the story is NOT the point of the show. So I understand people who tolerate that. But I'll say it anyway: the story and the universe of Dragon Ball makes no god damn sense.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the universe. I think I never saw a world so inconsistent, even in japanimation. There are no clear living species, Toriyama just puts whatever comes into his mind and many species don't even have an official name (hello, \"Frieza's race\").\\n\\n\r\nThen, the story. The quality of the narration depends on the arc. Everyone liked the story of Cell and the Cyborgs. It's actually the only story worth telling in this whole show. That's why I was really surprised to learn that this arc was actually completely improvised.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, worst of all: there's a lot of incoherences. The Dragon Balls are the worst. First, they're on Earth and are limited ; then, we learn that another planet has Dragon Balls, that are conveniently way less restricted than the Earth ones. And now, there are seven huge DBs in the galaxy? Make up your mind, damn it! It's the name of the show, so why does it have no clear definition?!!!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I won't develop any more, the story of Dragon Ball is shit, everyone knows it.\\n\r\nI read a review saying that it wasn't as stupid as Fairy Tail. I'll counterbalance and say that DB IS indeed way more stupid AND at least the universe of Fairy Tail makes sense, which we can't say about DB.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nThe anime is horrendous. Toei Animation is a very old studio that weren't able to evolve and keeps serving us old-school level animes. Today they simply can't keep up against their opponents. If their style was good 20 years ago, now their shows are so ugly!\\n\r\nThe animation is bad, it's slack and not fluid enough to be enjoyable. Their shows are the kind where the characters chat for at least 70% of their fight, which results in unbelievably long fights (remember Goku vs Frieza).\\n\\n\r\nThe drawings are very bad as well, especially Dragon Ball Super.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nNow that's a bit better here. The OST has memorable themes and the openings are very good. No, they're better than that, some of them are even legendaries!\\n\\n\r\nI do have a problem with the seiyuus though. I've never had any problem with seiyuus, EXCEPT in Dragon Ball. Their voices are simply not believable. Whenever I hear Goku, I don't even hear a human. I think I would take him more seriously with a robotic voice (which would still be bad).\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nThe characters in DB are badass, and... that's all. Aside from that, they're all brain dead and most of them are useless as f*ck. I still can't believe Bulma was one of the MCs in DB!\\n\r\nThe chara-design makes no sense, like everything else in DB.\\n\\n\r\nFuture Trunks is the only character with a memorable story. For the rest, you may be interested in the Saiyan race origin story ; personnally, they lost me with the Super Saiyan levels.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI did enjoy reading the manga of Dragon Ball. But the story was shit, and that's the only thing the anime took from the manga. Then, they added a horrendous art style, and take way too long to fight. Not only that, they also added a bunch of fillers with literally zero interest.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, when it comes to Dragon Ball, the only thing worth mentioning is the original manga, the OST of the anime, and the openings.\\n\r\nAmong the long anime shows, this one is definitely the worst.",

And in this review, i will tell you why it - not only; doesn't provide that. It's slaps the loyal fans in the face at every single turn. \r\nStory 5/10 Much like Dragon ball, and shonenen fashion. The show focuses on multiple arcs, containing more challenging opponents. Some do this well (One Piece) others not so much. (Dragon Ball: Super) Aside from, maybe (And that's a big maybe) Zamasu, every villain, or opponent feels completely underwhelming.And for me, Zamasu was also a major let down. There's no emotion, no struggle, no badass moments. Nothing we dragon ball fans have come to love. They even have the gual to rehash 2 movies, in 2 drawn out arcs. Just because they want to length the show. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10 you know those over used DBS animation memes? It's like that. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10 There are some admittedly decent moments when a song will play during a fight. But the song choices are never anything good. And during Goku's fight with Jiren - may go full blown cringey. For the most part, the music is either meh, or awful. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10 God, i wanted this to be a better rating... I was so afraid this would happen. The characters with pre-established development, are left to coast on that. While the writing staff does everything in their power to destroy what little depth these characters had. The side characters like Krillian, Piccolo, and even Gohan. Are so far gone, that they server almost no purpose at all in any of the plots. Focusing almost exclusively on Vegeta, and Goku. But what really kills me, is that they decimated Vegeta's character. What once was a proud, and headstrong Sayian warrior. Is now nothing more than Goku's power hungry Tsundere friend... Everyone exsits to hype up Goku's fight. and it's always been this way. but now, these side characters are completely devoid of any meaningful moments. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10 *NOTE* i am exclusively talking about new content. Not the 2 movies arc. If i added them, this number would be in the negatives. For the most part, this show is an utter chore to chug through. But when Goku does enter the battle. It's at the very least - meh. Everything besides Goku's fights are so drawn out, and boring. That after episode 30 something. I just started flipping through the episode looking for Goku's next fight. Every now and then, a comedic episode will pop up that's decent enough to warrent a watch. But very rapidly, you'll realize. You're only watching the show on the off chance one of your childhood character will do something memorable. And spoiler alert, they don't. Ever...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10 this show isn't worth your time. Even if you're a die hard fan of the series like i am. It's a chore to watch. And for all the 10 episodes worth of actually, somewhat enjoyable content. There's 110 episode of bland, pointless, borderline filler, anime. This show will leave you disappointing, and hurt. Because it's clear to me, this anime is nothing more than an attempt to sell out.",

            "content": "[Watched Only In Japanese]\r\nIts no secret that I think that Dragon Ball is spiraling down an eternal hole of darkness, one from which there is no escape. Goku has descended into a caricature of his former self, Vegeta has reversed all of his character development, Toei has more-or-less forgotten how to treat Gohan, and the plot grows more and more ridiculous.\r\nThe series started off at a terrible point by adapting the two most recent films in the franchise. The show would have been better off not retreading this familiar territory, but it doesn't really get much better after that. \r\nThe Universe 6 tournament was amediocre arc with a pretty cool end, made worse by mediocre animation. The Goku Black Arc was interesting and fresh for the first half. Toei had successfully turned an idea as dumb as an evil Goku into an interesting concept. However, the arc then fell to pieces in its ending and left an all out bitter taste in my mouth. \\n\\n\r\nThe Tournament of Power had the potential to be an incredible return to form for the franchise. Throughout the preparation episodes, the anime was bringing back the ideas of strategy, and removing the idea that power is absolute. However, the arc ended up heavily dragging and ruining itself. The 40 minute tournament took forever and came choke full of missed potential. With a villain so basic he makes Broly seem deep and fascinating, the tournament finished off in a predictable and sad way. You could get the same information and enjoyment out of a compilation fo some of its best moments. The highs of this arc are amazing, but  the lows are so awful. All of this combined with a lame narrative through-line and the dragging plot result in a lackluster overall arc.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn't particularly a fan of the soundtrack either, save the second opening and Ultimate Battle. There were a few other notable themes, but many of them aren't ones I'll ever listen to in my free-time. \\n\\n\r\nYamamuro's character designs just hurt me at a personal level, and make me yearn for the days of old. Along with this, while much of the animation is gorgeous, the rest ranges from ugly to awful. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of the characterization falls flat, and Goku has ascended into a full on caricature of himself. I yearn for the days where Goku could be a hero who protects those in need AND a goofy uneducated child who just wants a simple fight. Speaking of the overused main character, the voice of Nozawa Masako doesn't bother me in the slightest, and I now feel weird returning to Schemmel's portrayal. However, I can see why someone wouldn't like her, and I can respectfully not try and argue that point.\\n\\n\r\nThis poor series embodies some of the worst elements of Dragon Ball, the bloated muscles and constant transformations and alien bull. I can see why someone would like those things, but that isn't what Dragon ball is for me. Personally, Dragon Ball started its descent during the middle of the Freeza Arc, and just cascaded from there. While I didn't hate GT, it definitely wasn't a positive time in the franchise, but for me, Super is about as low as Dragon Ball has ever been. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't see Dragon Ball ever regaining the glory it had before the introduction of Super Saiyan.\\n\\n\r\nStill not as bad as Dragon Ball Minus.",

            "content": "Honestly, I wanted to love this series to a point of fanboyism but many things come up short. While I still do love it, it did have a lot of issues that the series itself wasn't at fault for. What I mean is, Toei. Toei underestimated how much people love Dragon Ball, and I'll get into that as the review goes on.\r\nStory\r\nWhile Super is a continuation of Dragon Ball Z, it does not take place after the last episode as Pan is not born as of the first episode. The first two arcs are basically Battle of Gods and Resurrection 'F' movies with subtle differences.Things pick up with the Universe 6 saga and the hype truly lives by the time Future Trunks pops in. All in all, after the first two arcs, you'll be greeted with a fun story that touches on the whimsy of the original Dragon Ball far more than GT ever did. Also the return of Kaioken is something fans like me love. (patching up plot holes from DBZ and causing their own is a thing so if you're a fan of that, that's cool)\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nLet's not sugarcoat it...the first two sagas had complete poop art. We've all seen it and most of us have been upset about it. The reason for this isn't because there's no time to make each episode, but the fact Toei didn't understand how big Dragon Ball was and assigned a lot of newbies in the industry to what is probably their biggest franchise. The animation team doesn't use the same techniques as their Z predecessors so the way they handle high speed animation is hit or miss. As of episode 66, I think the animation has nearly become on par with DBZ.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nLet me start with this, I will never skip the OP because it is that enjoyable. While the sound track has some fun tunes playing, new songs don't really come in until another saga begins. When it comes to the voice over, the only performance that's jarring to me is King Kai. Joji Yanami, from my understanding, got sick and could no longer voice King Kai due to his slow recovery and older age. Currently the role has been taken over by Naoki Tatsuta, the voice of Oolong. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nSurprisingly enough, there is a fair amount of character development. Vegeta in particular has come a long way from the Saiyan Saga. He is now a loving father and husband, who is A LOT less stubborn than used to be. While he is still trying to be better than Goku, he's a lot more accepting of him as a friendly rival. Gohan is also of particular interest because he's wanting to be a fighter again but much hasn't been done with him yet in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAs the episodes go on, the series keeps getting better and better, my only real complaint is that the pacing is all over the place and recently I feel that things are just going by too fast. It's a very fun series that actually keeps me interested no matter the flaws.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nStill rough around the edges but it brings back the spirit of Dragon Ball! Ignore those first 5 episodes and you'll be fine.\\n",

            "content": "**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS**\r\nMy relationship with Dragon Ball : I had watched bits of Dragon Ball when I was a kid but I never knew the complete story. Then, in 2014 I binge watched DBKai and Final Chapters and realised that this was the greatest anime of all time. Then came Dragon Ball Super. \r\nSummary of how I think I felt during the story :\r\nFirst 28 episodes were retelling of the movies with shitty art and animation. Watch the movies instead. \r\nNext came the Tournament arc with Universe 6. Finally, got new content. It was good. This arc introduced many new characters and newinformation like Universe 6 Saiyans, Multiple Universes, Super Dragon Balls and Zeno. It opened up infinite possibilities for the series and I was really excited to see the direction in which the series would have gone, only to be let down afterwards. \\n\\n\r\nThen came the Future Trunks saga. This arc had its moments but overall it was a bad arc in my opinion. Trunks getting emotional was really sad to watch and you could feel his pain. The animation had improved slightly for the fights. The idea of Black Goku was intriguing and  the villain was well written. He was not just another generic baddie. Beerus killing Zamasu was one of the best moments in the entire series. However, later the arc went downhill. We couldn't make any sense of the power levels(but that's a problem that plagued the whole of Super), and the fights were too fan fiction-ey. The ending didn't make any sense with Trunks somehow defeating the villian with a power up.\\n\\n\r\nNext was the Universe Survival Saga. It was great until the last few episodes. They changed how the anime looked to give it the old feel and the art and animation got a lot better. I didn't mind the bad animation of Super until then since I was watching a version of the show where Goku was voiced by an old lady. This change in the look of the show gave a lot of fans including me, the hope that the series might be finally getting better. The animation and art was brilliant at some points and the episodes were really entertaining. There were many twists including the inclusion of Frieza which was unexpected. We even got a mysterious villian called Jiren who looked invincible who was then revealed at the end to be an uninteresting baddie with a shitty backstory. The final episodes were...different. Overall a 7/10 anime. \\n\\n\r\nPros: \\n\r\n-More Dragon Ball \\n\r\n-World building and new possibilities with the introduction of multiverse. \\n\r\n-Beerus and Whis\\n\r\n-Some epic moments, fight scenes, twists and some slice of life episodes. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Subpar art and animation for the majority of the show. \\n\r\n-No sense of power levels. \\n\r\n-Power ups without explanations and new forms just to sell toys. \\n\r\n-Turning Goku from a battle genius who didn't give a shit about anything else into an idiot whose good at fighting and achieving new asspull forms just like that because that's what Saiyans do.(according to Vegeta anyway).\\n\\n\r\n-Turning Dragon Ball Z and all its characters kids friendly. (I know Dragon Ball was a kids show but still...). \\n\r\n-Turning the bulky characters to stick figures. \\n\\n\r\nMusic : Some tracks from Final Chapters were reused for this anime. I felt that the number of tracks were low. Same music was played throughout the anime with very few additions in the last arc. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10. Watch it if you want to.",

            "content": "Dragon Ball is Dead, All hail Dragon Ball.\r\nDespite having some bad criticisms from the fans when it began the series had some positive ones later on, probably because people who hated stopped watching or the ones who watched were casual fans who were like \u00ab\u00a0yeah well what can you do about it\u00a0\u00bb or hardcore fans who jumped on the bandwangon because some of their Youtubers who criticized the show at the start stopped and told them to support it (because of their sponsors/views) and hyped it every single week for the past three years in order to get their check.\r\nThe truth is, knowing it's reallybad in many aspects they will probably use the remote control and will state afterwards that even if they reviewed it for about three years \u00ab\u00a0They were not fans\u00a0\u00bb and will say that it wasn't that good, they will highlight the issues of the series only when it will be finished because they couldn't afford to do such thing when it was airing. I mean, nobody would take the risk to lose so much subs or sponsors. Dragon Ball Super IS without the shadow of a doubt, one of the worst anime series ever and people who see the series as a guilty pleasure are actually admitting that too in a way. It's one of the most inconsistent mess from a writing, directing perspective I've ever seen and I'm not even speaking about its art or its animation which are much weaker than GT's. And yet, thanks to the Youtubers (and mainly their sponsors) and websites and hardcore DB clickbaiters fans it was one of the most hyped one. \\n\\n\r\nThis series managed to mix all of the wrong aspects of mangas/animes today and became a generic show using multiple forms of fanservice during its run, due to its success it wouldn't be surprising for other shows to try and redo some of its formula meaning that Super is a bad omen for what is to come for the manga/anime world in general. The only reason that makes people care more about Super than GT is because Toriyama's name is mentionned. Toriyama also worked on GT and on a few movies back then when it comes to chara-design and so on, the main difference here is that he's just developing basic ideas for the franchise. He already did this for filler arcs from the Z series back then. Super takes place after the Buu saga, the beginning is another take on the movies Battle of Gods (That Watanabe wrote) and Fukkatsu no F.\\n\\n\r\nYou have to understand that from a marketable point of view in order to not repeat the disaster that Dragon Ball GT was for the fans, Toei had to use Toriyama's name at some extent. For the fans Dragon Ball Super is the canon sequel to Dragon Ball but it's more complicate than that, I don't think \u00ab canon \u00bb is a synonym for \u00ab quality \u00bb and the truth is people said the movies were canon before Super became a part of the franchise. The story has 2 or 3 takes per arc, the basic story remains the same but many things changed when you're comparing the movies to the anime series or to the manga, Dragon Ball Super is an original anime but the fact is even if the manga is done for promotional purposes only both have access to Toriyama's original plot points. Both the anime and the manga share more similarities with what people might call fanfictions. Canon is a dead concept and even if it wasn't it's not a shield which can cover the flaws of the actual series.\\n\\n\r\nThe changes when it comes to the chara-design which was made to look more childish (round faces, less muscles, shiny colours, simple design) always bothered me from an artistic point of view. One of Dragon Ball Super's producers talked about the anime and its animation issues at Barcelone (29th October) with its chara-designer Yamamuro and said the critics were too excessive, that the problems were just about a few scenes but does acknowledge that some of the animators who worked on Dragon Ball Super were newbies which is more than surprising. Using new animators for such a big franchise is more than problematic for obvious reasons which tells us a lot on its production by the way. Toei's problems when it comes to their animations is quite known. There was the Sailor Moon Crystal polemic, World Trigger being too static, the end of Toriko decreasing from an animation point of view, some of Saint Seiya's spin-offs being poorly drawn and each fanbase more or less complained about the animation of these shows every single time. When it comes to Dragon Ball the fanbase is divided on that topic, recently it became even more complicate to speak about the quality of the series without people losing their minds and defending the show as hard as they could, like the holy grail, when Super actually does have a lot of bad animations or bad, sketchy and not well detailed drawings in its show. Other fanbases admitted it and called a spade a spade in due time and each time it was most likely a consensus which says a lot about the degree of denial of the DB fandom. (Compare the quality of Super to other long-running animes, like Bleach, Hunter x Hunter 2011 and so on)\\n\\n\r\nThe timeline of Dragon Ball Super is more than confusing. When it comes to Dragon Ball the main characters are known to surpass themselves, with that being said the story taking place after the Buu saga and before Uub arrives is tricky (Uub arrives 10 years after the Buu saga). Obviously there are more chances that things won't add up, like Trunks and Goten's appearances. We could probably say that Goten ages like his father but at one point Trunks would have to look like Future Trunks. Also, Pan is 4 years old at the end of Z which means that as soon as she is born the story should take place 5-6 years after the Buu saga but the fact is Goku and Bulma state that they didn't see each other for 5 years. (Interesting that Bulma complained about it and said \u00ab Only 5 years ago \u00bb in volume 42, chapter 324) Uub's introduction after in the context of Super makes little sense, speaking of which, Vegeta clearly didn't know who Goku's referring to (Uub) at the end of the manga and yet in Dragon Ball Super (Episode 30 I think) Goku tells Piccolo, Gohan and Vegeta that he wanted Buu to be reincarnated just before the Champa tournament when Piccolo was training Gohan after the Fukkatsu no F arc. It's just a few exemples here, there are way more problems than that when it comes to continuity, I covered them all arc by arc but it'd be too long to talk about them all here. I managed to make a top 10 of the biggest issues with GT, when it comes to Super there is a top 10/20 per arc (which include all of the plotholes).\\n\\n\r\nBOG the first arc of the show is closer to Neko Majin Z (Toriyama's parody of his own series) than Dragon Ball Z. The comedic tone for the story makes the stakes here seem non-existant compared to what we've seen in the previous sagas...that's why I'd be comparing it with Neko Majin Z. Beerus is not an antagonist so to speak, Pilaf and his gang kinda set the tone here and are irrelevant to the story as a whole to me. Dragon Ball becoming more and more mature (as a story) through the years made sense, from my point of view trying to use the old gags and so on is a huge step back mainly because like I just said, the comedy side will tend to reduced the importance of the stakes. Even the musics are not here to create a dramatical effect like in the Z saga, through the electronic sounds they are mainly here to create a comedic effect. Our main characters don't have any kind of positive character developement, Vegeta goes from a sort of comic-relief to his old character from the Cell saga. Goku's recent character developement and portrayal has been terrible, it's like a giant step back. Adding to that the heavy-handed humor using his stupidity as a plot convenience, it just makes the whole show suffer a bit more. One will say that at this point it won't make much of a difference. But it's painful to see such a famous and important character having some kind of unexplained degenerative brain disorder. Other than that there is no real evolution, Super pretends that it took a lot for Gohan to comeback and fight when he actually always did that in the manga. Each time the planet was threatened he fought, he did not train during 7 years because he thought the peace would remain and I think that's a part that Toei misunderstood because he did admitt he should have trained and said he will keep training in the manga (after seeing how strong Goten truly is) and followed the group in order to fight Buu without thinking twice, the Androids and Cell back then. Him studying (like he always did) is not a reason for him to not care about the earth, his character never was like that to begin with so there is no reason for me to see his treatment as an evolution or as an actual development. Other than that none of the characters really had some kind if character development. They all had power-ups outta nowhere tho. Android 17surpassing Vegeto in 6 years after training in a forest with squirrels and so on. The funniest part of the whole show. Kame Sennin/Muten Roshi surpassing Chiaotzu who always trained and Yamcha... because...skipping the Saiyajin, the Android sagas' power levels so that he could be on par with them with no explanation whatsoever was also a big surprise too. Maybe the fact that he tried to \"sexually assault and rape\" Puar during a serious arc in episode 91, no I'm not making that up, helped him out. Or the powers of the gifted Saiyajins from universe 6 who managed to master SSJ1 and 2 and another unknow level (Berserker, a ripoff of Broly's legendary form) in one single day. What a mess.\\n\\n\r\nEven when it comes to the show's story, there is nothing new, having multiple universes was a way for Toei to create new strong opponents without justifying their power levels (they should have) and to reuse the exact same stories, like the Other World Tournament where they got the Kaioken SSJ idea, while adding concepts borrowed from fanfictions to the whole thing like Dragon Ball Multiverse and Dragon Ball AF. But honestly, what was the show's moral? What did it tell us? Dragon Ball, Z and GT had morals to their journeys...what was Super's\u00a0since fanservice is not a moral or a message. So what was the message there? Was Dragon Ball Super really \u00ab\u00a0needed\u00a0\u00bb? I don't really think it was and the series itself proved it in many ways. Sequels or reboots tend to undermine the overall vision of a work and purge them culturally and intellectually, particularly by monopolizing its title. In my opinion that's unfortunately what Dragon Ball Super did to the original work and its aura.\\n\\n\r\nDragon Ball is Dead, All hail Dragon Ball.",

            "content": "Dragon Ball; a franchise, that is still going, despite the lack of anything interesting to add to it. But the die-hard fans appearently still want more. The first sign of it's ressurgence, that I remember was a Facebook post, that if I'm not mistaken the company Bandai Namco made; It was when Dragon Ball felt like spinning it's course. The Playstation 3 games had been nothing but inferior versions of the older existing Playstation 2 games, so the company decided to directly ask fans, whether they still want to support the franchise or not. Appearently this worked, because the post managed to collect enough likesfor Bandai Namco to not give it up; It ultimately resulted in the critically not well received game \"Battle of Z\". The quality appearently didn't matter enough though, because after that (whether that was the reason or not is up to debate), Dragon Ball started showing new signs of life; first they decide to bring back Dragon Ball into cinema with Battle of Gods and later they even did a game, that wasn't just the same thing over again (well, it kinda still is) with Xenoverse. With nostalgia milking being one of the most popular trends in modern entertainment, it was only a matter of time till an actual tv sequel would follow.\\n\\n\r\nNow you may ask yourself; Why exactly am I writing a review and why do I bother watching the series, when you can obviously read from my overall score, that I gave it a poor rating? Thing is Dragon Ball was my favourite series, when I was a kid, and when it was announced I was indeed interested in where it goes. Back when I was 7 they were airing the original series on the german channel RTLII and it was the best tv experience I had in those days, with the over the top battles and the juvenile jokes perfectly resonating with my mindset at the time. Since Super decided to reboot the latest two movies, it was also a bit harder to accept, that this was all a nostalgia-milking process, because you foolishly believed the new content to eventually turn worthwhile. By the time, that happened you however already spent 30 weeks on the series and decided, that your investment was already big enough to as well see it end. Besides, it's not like 20 minutes on a weekend is that big of an investment. Not to mention the reviewing part is actually pretty fun. You also probably want to know, why I bother reviewing it, when it's nowhere near finished? I guess it's due to my selfish determination to bring my thoughts on paper. I just felt like it. Especially since it's currently starting to develop more hype, so I figured; Let's reflect about it a bit. I will likely write a review covering the whole series, when it finishes, but right now I feel like talking about the stuff, that is there.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's start with the most important category; the STORY. I warn you beforehand; there will be minor SPOILERS, I won't write anything directly, but I will point out a thing or two, if I think it could help me bring my point across better. I guess that doesn't really require me to put anything in spoiler tags. You've been warned. But let's start;\\n\\n\r\nLike I already said, Super decided to buy some time at first by remaking the latest two movies, which were written by original creator Akira Toriyama. First we start with the BATTLE OF GODS arc. To start off, let me say it as it is; I liked the movie. It wasn't anything brilliant, but it introduced a fun enough new villain with Beerus the God of Destruction, had goofy comedy, that worked and was well animated throughout. Yes, the Super Saiyan God transformation was stupid both conceptionally and design-wise and the writing felt like another unnecessary tacked-on story to the Dragon Ball series, but it still felt like decent enough fan service. That being said remaking the arc for the tv series, didn't exactly work, because the writers didn't bother with improving upon the base material at all. For the first 13 episodes or so, you get the exact same product, but with worse animation and poorer pacing. They switch up the jokes, but that fell flat as well, because if you are familiar with the jokes in the movie, the jokes will feel like the same thing all over again. Not to mention the battles in the series were poor. You can imagine my dissapointment, when Goku finally goes Super Saiyan God to fight Beerus and the fight you get is just them clashing their fists together like they were Naruto and Sasuke doing the Rasengan/Chidori clash three times in a row. But hey it can only go upstream from that on, right?\\n\\n\r\nSadly no. FRIEZA'S RESSURECTION arc, was the one where I thought you could improve upon the source material a lot, by stretching it out, introducing more enemy characters, give more spotlight to the characters, who got snubbed out of it in the \"Ressurection F\"-movie, which the arc is based on and make Frieza's plan a little more elaborate. But once again the writers just couldn't allow themselves to mess with Toriyama's ideas a bit and bringing the best out of it. To be fair they added some stuff, but none of it was worthwhile. Among others they almost carbon-copied Krillins first significant character arc of the original Dragon Ball. You know the one, where he faces his bullies from the monastery and unexpectedly realizes he's stronger than them. I guess half the people who've seen DBZ haven't bothered watching the original, so they probably didn't even notice it. There's also the return of Ginyu, that was just another forgettable affair, that didn't add anything interesting to the table. I genuinely feel like you would get the same amount of plot and substance as this arc has to offer, if you played Budokai Tenkaichi 3, selectively picked characters to play and to battle against, listened to the before battle dialoge, finish the fight and listen to the victory line of your character.\\n\\n\r\nNow we get to the first new material TOURNAMENT arc. Now stuff gets good, right? First we're introduced to Beerus' overweight brother and Whis' female version of a sister; Champa and Vados, because Toriyama was really on a roll with his character ideas. Because everyone is a gourmet now, Champa gets jelous of Beerus' universe and plots a 5 on 5 tournament to steal earth from his borthers universe by winning. This could have been an interesting fan service type of thing. Unfortunately the characters are as stale as ever and the battles just underwhelming. Our main team's squad pretty much gets reduced to just Goku and Vegeta again, because Majin Buu is too dumb to participate and Beerus' handpicked contestant is... I guess that would be considered a spoiler, so I can't tell. Piccolo atleast gets a fight, that's decently choregraphed, but ultimately just ends up being another 20 minutes, that don't really add that much to the plot progression. On the enemies' team we get a big yellow teddy bear, universe 6 Frieza, a giant robot, who doesn't like racial slurs and whom I actually liked, a saiyan kid and purple Pikkon. Ultimately Winnie the Pooh and the Tinman are just minibosses to stretch the plot. Universe 6 Frieza is the one-dimensional two-faced politician, who (which is a thing I actually liked) prepared for the fights against his god-level adversaries by using the only types of tricks, that appearently work against them, which would have been cool, if it weren't for his bland personality and anticlimatic defeat. The Saiyan boy is basically a rehash of the final DBZ episode, but by using Vegeta instead of Goku. And there's purple Pikkon, who despite being the strongest being of his universe works as an assassin.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that came another shorter FILLER arc, were Goten and Trunks accidentally end up on different planet, that however didn't add much to the bigger picture. Other than using some ideas from GT, messing even more with power levels by completely contradicting, what was implied about them in the previous 3 arcs and giving us the image of Vegeta sucking on a pacifier.\\n\\n\r\nNow we arrive at the present with the GOKU BLACK arc. Once again Toriyama dwellt deep in his idea box (the fanfic box, that is), to dig up another idea for an unnecessary story continuation. A lot of people like it appearently. Unfortunately I can't join them. The villain feels cliched and uninteresting even for Dragon Ball standards; he's neither sadistic or dark like the previous DBZ-villains nor as goofy as early DB-villains, but also not sympathetic enough in his pursuit for his own ideals to be somewhat likeable. Not to mention the arc so far was only a chain of clashes with the villains, that barely led anywhere and got interrupted in the end, keeping people's attention by more silly transformations, that don't do anything else, but make characters supposedly stronger and relevant in battle.\\n\\n\r\nNow with the story out of the way, there are a few other categories to discuss. Let's start with the ACTION. I already addressed it previously; it's not good. The choreographies are for the most part weak. I remember people cheering for the Vegeta VS Cabba battle, because it atleast a bit reminded them of DBZ battles. Problem however is, that DBZ used to pull those same choreographies on an episodes basis back in the day. To be fair, this area is improving, with some more decent fights in the latest episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is the COMEDY. I've noticed people apologizing DBS's comedy by saying it's trying to recapture the days of the original DB-series and that if you go back to the original series, you will immediately see that. Well I did just that and let me tell you one thing; DB had much better comedy. Especially early on, when it didn't took its fighting aspects as seriously and even the most serious fights could include well written jokes like Krillin and Master Roshi motivating the narrator to help them recreate exactly what  happened in the fraction of a second during a battle, because the audience couldn't comprehend their high speed movements. DB was full of those creative and absurd but also edgy jokes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the CHARACTERS; they're stale now. Goku was never particularly interesting, but DBZ avoided him becoming annoying by making him give his main character spot over to Gohan and serve as more of a mentor figure and trump card. Now he still has the trump card role, but his getting way more exposure, than is good for the series. The second most important character is Vegeta. He was one of the more interesting characters in DBZ. He went from ruthless planet destroyer, to ally to the Z-Fighters out of convenience and ultimately became part of their family. He got especially interesting in the last 2 arcs, because of his pursuit to reach Goku, who was clearly superior to him, despite not having royal blood. Now with that character arc over, he's just training, because that's what he does. No other characters really matter. I guess I like Beerus for being a snarky gourmet and Piccolo for becoming a babysitter and him being my favourite character in DBZ. A lot of people complain about them \"ruining\" Gohan, but atleast he went the direction DBZ intended him to.\\n\\n\r\nNow to the PRESENTATION; we all know the dreadful episode 5. Yes, the ART can become really horrendous at times. But atleast it's improving just like the animation. The most praiseworthy thing about the series in my opinion is the SOUNDTRACK. It fits the tone well and the opening feels weirdly in line to \"Cha-la Head Cha-la\" and that other opening DBZ had back in the days of the Majin Saga.\\n\\n\r\nAs you are able to see, my overall opinion on DBS is not positive. I honestly think it's even weaker than DBGT. GT atleast knew how to play with the existing DB-lore more creatively, even if didn't make much sense in the end. I don't recommend it, but based on what I already said in the intro I might as well finish, what I started.\\n\\n\r\n3/10",

Of course I will make sure to edit this review if something will change my view.\r\nJust like everybody I was excited to see more of Dragon Ball sinceit's just the best Anime ever!\\n\r\nI can understand that many didn't like the first (~25) episodes because it was just a retelling of the movies Battle of Gods and Revival of F. I didn't enjoy them that much as well, although I thought the \"new\" Battle of Gods was worse and the \"new\" Revival of F better than the movies themselves. \\n\r\nBUT! the real thing starts after (!) that so for me it makes no sense rating the movie parts. I will focus on what's after.\\n\r\nIt starts pretty nice with some new characters, everyone's interesting and with a exciting new story - a tournament. It's still as hilarious as it was before and it's still as heartwarming as we know. Enough fights but also enough story. \\n\r\nAs for the art I also prefer the old style but the new one is not bad either.\\n\r\nTo say a negative thing I think it happens too little in one episode. 20% of the whole episodes are basically flashbacks but it seems that they get better every while.\\n\\n\r\nThat's everything I want to say for now, I am looking forwards to more episodes every week and can't wait to know how it continues. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT: seen episode 39 and got an orgasm. might give this a 10.\\n\r\nEDIT: seen episode 41, and I love this old Dragon Ball humour :)",

            "content": "Dragon Ball Super when it first started out, was widely criticized by many due to many reasons.\r\nFirstly, poor animation. DBS started out with poor animation, considering it can cost up to $300,000 to make one episode, this is understandable but having better animation would certainly be more appealing.\r\nSecond, power scaling problems. There are many many 'flaws' to Dragon Ball as a whole not just DBS. It just doesn't make sense that someone clearly weaker or more inexperienced can fight toe to toe with someone much much much stronger. \r\nOne of the more common talking points is Frieza being able to beat Goku after only fourmonths of training. If that's the case, take into account that Frieza at 100 percent power gave Super Saiyan Goku trouble way back on Namek, without training a day in his life. His raw strength was so much so that he never had to train to confront anyone stronger than him\u2014at the time, he was the strongest in the universe (Beerus and Majin Buu were asleep) so it makes sense for him to be that strong. \\n\\n\r\n I\u2019ve seen a lot of people say that characters like Gohan and Android 17 were able to make Goku go Super Saiyan Blue so they must be at god-level strength. This is not the case because Goku\u2019s Blue form does not have a rigid power level. Since it depends on perfect ki control, Goku can modify his energy output so as to not go all out and destroy people or even planets. Come on guys, are you seriously telling me that Goku was going 100 percent on Gohan and 17? If he wanted to, he could have easily wiped the floor with them in an instant. If you\u2019re saying that Goku went to Blue because these characters were THAT strong, then explain to me why Blue wasn\u2019t effective against Zamasu at all? Or why Vegito\u2014arguably the strongest character in the entire franchise\u2014had to be formed to stand a chance of beating him? There\u2019s no other explanation other than Goku holding back. \\n\\n\r\nThird, many fans complain that DBS is only about Goku, that is true but there is nothing wrong with that because the show is about HIM, it's like saying 'WHY IS NARUTO IN EVERY EPISODE OF NARUTO' because the show IS ABOUT NARUTO not everyone else in the Hidden Leaf Village.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm here, I'm also going to address Gohan\u2019s character development, which is STILL somehow a huge talking point for the series. \\n\\n\r\nLet me make this clear. Gohan is not a Saiyan\u2014he is a half Saiyan. Gohan never liked fighting. He never reveled in it. From the get go, he has always tried to resolve things peacefully and without conflict. He only fought because he was forced to, not because he WANTED to. So WHY people are complaining about the fact that he\u2019s not kicking butt on screen every other episode is beyond me. He was NEVER meant to fight. He wanted to just live a normal life as a student. He\u2019s doing something now in the latest arc, which is great to see for nostalgia purposes, but if you're going to say that Dragon Ball Super is a bad show because Gohan isn't fighting, then you really need to reconsider how well you know the series in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nBUT.\\n\\n\r\nWith the end of the series and the final arc finished, I''m sure all you DB fans are finally satisfied. Everything I mentioned above was fixed even though in my opinion none of it was actually wrong. Let's just say it was a necessary improvement, not really to improve the anime but to please the fans whilst improving the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'd safely say 1/3 of the anime was the Tournament of Power, one of the most epic arc or to be more precise, the arc that contains the most epic battles.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation also improved drastically if I don't say so myself. The Tournament of Survival Arc is literally a 48 minute battle that lasted through an epic series of consecutive battles throughout a good 50 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis was no doubt the main 'comeback' for DBS and this of course helped the anime end in a BANG\\n\\n\r\nPower scaling was still a bit of a problem but the anime managed to provide some or at least a slight bit of explanation to why certain characters are suddenly/still so strong.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with the arc featuring the strongest warriors in all of the universes, we get to see every character getting much much stronger due to breaking past their limit. This was very predictable however it was understandable and very well done because it all had one reason and that was survival.\\n\\n\r\nIt allowed development for almost every main character in the arc for that one simple reason. Because similar to real life, in a battle for survival one can and will go above and beyond their limits to survive.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Goku went well above his limits and I can say the same for all our warriors in the Tournament of Power, even the enemies of our Universe 7 warriors went beyond themselves to fight for survival.\\n\\n\r\nThis allowed us to capture everyone's 'Full Power' and be amazed at the new levels of power they achieve and also take us on a rollercoaster of feelings as despite becoming overpowered from breaking their limit, nothing is decided simply because breaking your own limit takes a huge toll on your stamina and because of that fact, once your stamina wears off, you can't do anything at all.\\n\\n\r\nOur main character Goku was the epitome of that. He broke his limit once in an epic battle against the strongest mortal being in all universes, Jiren and attained a level that even gods fear, Ultra Instinct. He then lost almost all his stamina and afterwards attaining UI again when fighting Kefla, another super strong Saiyan and finally mastering it and using it once more in the final fight against Jiren. He tired himself out time and time again but endured till the final battle where he ended up working with none other than.\\n\\n\r\nFrieza\\n\\n\r\nThere was ALOT of development for other characters as well, their personality and all for example who would have ever thought someone like Frieza would end up working together with Saiyans the main beings he despises when pushed/cornered to his limit or Frieza actually saving so many of Universe 7 warriors, even boldly sacrificing himself and actually putting his trust on them and them actually trusting him.\\n\\n\r\nTruly an unexpected turn of events and true character development. Who would've known how much one can change in a battle of survival or when cornered. I'm really glad that the anime actually seized the opportunity to develop every character largely through this ark.\\n\\n\r\nWith this one ark alone, everything the fans were hating on at the beginning was fixed. It also showed us that teamwork was very important since most of the time our characters would be selfish and attempt to 1v1 their opponents.\\n\\n\r\nThanks to the introduction of many clearly superior and truly overpowered opponents including one way way way beyond anyone Universe 7 ever faced, it helped our characters realize working alone isn't possible and even allowed someone like Frieza, not to mention our prideful Vegeta to understand and work together with their most hated comrades or letting go of their pride to beat their enemy.\\n\\n\r\nYes, I've begun to like Frieza through this ark despite him still being a ruthless dick actually seeing a change just once is really cool. And seeing how all our strongest MCs get pushed to a corner so badly, barely holding their own until they surpass their limits is very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say the final arc more than makes up for the beginning and this is probably one of the coolest and most amazing character development I've ever seen in Dragon Ball History.\\n\\n\\n\r\nContinue to amaze me. \\n\r\nTill we meet again",

            "content": "Let's start by re-introducing how I review Animes. First off, no Gamespot/IGN scores. This means 7 DOES NOT mean Average, nor 6 means Bad. That's the usual perspective of a lot of ppl, and has gone quite troublesome when properly reviewing. We'll take MAL's rating system, and round-off the overall score of all 5 elements. Second, I'll be saying as little to no spoilers as much as possible, unless stated otherwise when deemed necessary for a proper review. Third, take everything with a grain of salt.\r\nDragon Ball Super. A continuation from the classic Dragon Ball series, Z. An extended take on a shounen-genre anime, thatuses simple formula, but still works fairly well. I won't take my time reviewing previous Dragon Balls, such as the first and Z, and I will base my review solely on this with little comparison of Z and this as much as possible.\\n\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super is one of the first few Shounen anime I've watch again in quite some time as I've felt that I've outgrown the genre. But the simple take on the genre, even without much regard on other elements like storytelling, or character development still makes quite some great enjoyment. If there's one thing that proper Shounen animes can get away with, is that plot advancement can be done on the spot, without unnecessary story backtracking, and some Deus Ex Machina can even work on story/character development, without needlessly diminishing enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nCritical Review:\\n\\n\r\nStory - [6/10]\\n\r\nA fair rating for a shounen anime. Like I previously said, most shounen animes plot are usually made on spot, and aren't usually connecting major plot devices in previous storylines. There are some exceptions to this obviously, but those are quite uncommon. While DB Super connects a few things from back even as far as the original Dragon Ball, these are not major factors that will affect a lot of things that can become influential to the current story. Most of DB Super's plot are on-the-spot and advances from there taking a few things from the old and re-imagining them to something new.\\n\\n\r\nIn anycase, this doesn't mean it's bad, but that also means there's not much depth. Hence why the automatic memes of \"Akira Toriyama's asspulls\" is all true real...in some form atleast. Nevertheless, it's a simple formula that works, and for DB's lengthy run, it works well enough to stand on it's own. And it's this formula that keeps the series alive and well, and most likely it'll keep the series running for a long time...of course there are some things that we don't ever want to mention that has never worked for...(ehem GT).\\n\\n\r\nIf there's anything I will like to greatly compliment, it will be the pacing. DB Super has improved it's story pacing quite significantly, and has managed to forward it's plot properly without being too long nor short compared to Z. In the case of Universal Survival Saga of course, a 48 min battle in a course of a lot of episodes is somewhat understandable. Weird, but understandable, considering fights happening mostly at the same time in the course of 20+ episodes however I wished they would've made a more realistic timer than 48 mins.\\n\\n\r\nArt - [7/10]\\n\r\nTo start off, this was a mixed-bag for me honestly. DB Super's art in earlier episodes were...lackluster to say the least. Toei's legendary animation is showing, and the quality was so obvious even in a lot of crucial moments. Even seeing things that were of so low quality that when compared to Dragon Ball Z, it was just an embarrassment. However the quality gradually changes around later episodes, and the style becomes significantly eye-catching in some moments. Of course there are still some scenes where the quality drops which are still present in newer episodes, but these becomes mostly isolated in scenes where high-paced action is taken or where only a few seconds take place. Even so, quality in crucial scenes has become better to the point you'd be wanting for more. \\n\\n\r\nSound - [9/10]\\n\r\nI'm a fan of good sound and music. Sound is one thing, where something fits into an action, voice, or anything in the environment. In this case, it's good. I won't say there's anything I noticed bad in particular, because sounds like ambient are usually gone unnoticed in a lot of shows. \\n\\n\r\n(Seiyuu/VA)\\n\r\nVoice acting is done quite well by everyone, especially the main characters like Goku, Vegeta, even Frieza, etc. They all follow their roles well, and is always in character. Legendary seiyuus like Masako Nozawa who can do multiple characters in one go, I applaud you. (Rest In Peace, Hiromi Tsuru; 1960 - 2017; Voice of Bulma)\\n\\n\r\n(Music)\\n\r\nMusic is also amazing. I'd say Norihito Sumitomo has done well in the series, and a lot of the background music fits well in their respective scenes. From Goku first transforming to SSJG to Ultra Instinct. Classic intense shounen music that fits on almost everything shounen-like. I would even go far as to saying, my favorite music/scene combination in the series so far would have to go to Vegito Blue vs Fused Zamasu. That moment, even though it was just short, was enough to give me goosebumps. Continue on with the great music~\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - [7/10]\\n\r\nProperly delivering character development is somewhat hard in shounen animes without bloating the character themselves. But since the simple plot formula works, as long as they don't stray from this and don't focus for heavy-story elements like what some newer, ambitious animes do(eg. heavy back story of a character), it'll go smoothly. In the case of DB Super, this has been executed well.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the main cast has developed well off from their original selves in their prequels, as well as some previously thought obsolete characters like most of the Z-Fighters have redeemed themselves in the series. Which is why Super's character plot is actually a lot better than Z, because instead of slowly setting aside the old forgotten roster for newer, stronger characters, it has gone it's way back to their roots to make them useful again...atleast most of them(poor Yamcha). \\n\\n\r\nThe two main saiyans, Goku and Vegeta retains most of their old personalities. With Goku still the fun dumbstruck as ever, with a heart of gold, and Vegeta with his somewhat \"more Tsun, less dere\" side. Showing bits of their characters making them feel natural rather than forced, their human side despite being incredible forces of nature. While they're the ones mostly shown with their somewhat easygoing side(in terms of a story universe where almost anything can just flat out kill you), these characteristics are also shown to others as well, like Gods of Destruction, some enemies, etc. Making the show feel at pace with the main cast without the latter being too heavy for them to face in a normal conversation.\\n\\n\r\nSetting that aside, the show's use of character self-willpower/guts is heavy. As for all shounen-anime this works very well, and just intensifies the characters themselves. This simple thing, is one of the foundations of the series and most shounen animes. At the very least, self-willpower/guts power is something that's more satisfying to watch in a shounen anime, than \"nakama power\". Of course, this still has tiny bits of that, but atleast it doesn't overblown it to the point it feels...ughhh.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - [10/10]\\n\r\nI'd be lying if I say I didn't enjoy DB Super. Regardless of its undesirable animation quality in the earlier episodes, or anything remotely bad in some way, it still manages to get me wanting for more. Like I previously said, DB Super is one first mainstream shounen anime again I've watch in quite a while. I'm a person who thinks to himself \"I have superior taste than all those pathetic lowlife and weaboos.\", of course we all know that's what we all tell to ourselves.\\n\\n\r\nI've deviated from shounen animes for quite some time, thinking I've outgrown them. Watching a few hero animes like Boku no Hero Academia, OPM, etc. What triggered me to watch DB Super wasn't exactly nostalgia. No, it wasn't nostalgia as a child watching old DB/Z that rekindled my fondness of the series, rather how eye-catching the simple execution of shounen elements in a series like Dragon Ball Super. Being spoiled in facebook by friends, seeing Ultra Instinct scenes, already made me eager to watch it. Apparently, I just realized that there was little to no blood in the series...that's how much I enjoyed it that I completely unnoticed small details like that, but I guess I could say majority of shounen series are somewhat kid-friendly, like Fairy Tail even.\\n\\n\r\nJust seeing someone like Goku push his limits, taunt and fight Godlike beings. Sending shivers down my spine, and remembering memorable things like Vegito saying \"What's wrong? Is this all the power a God has?\" to Goku first achieving Ultra Instinct. It was exciting, just doing simple fighting, using martial arts, and tackle of Godlike beings. It was all intensifying and exciting overall, making me crave for newer episodes to come. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so...\\n\\n\r\nOverall - [8*/10] *7.8 rounded to 8\\n\r\nA classic series like Dragon Ball, and Super, proves that a series doesn't necessarily needs to have very heavy story elements and depth, like what a lot of modern series strives to do today to be enjoyed. Sure it'll add to the immersion, but one wrong slip, it can be fatal to the series. The right execution of shounen-elements will provide a long-running series have endless possibilities of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nDB Super's use of simple shounen-formula makes it safe from heavy criticism, and also a safe and fun choice for any fan of the shounen genre. It's plain and simple, and it's those reasons why it's good and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\nReviewed on December 21st, 2017. Right after binge-watching until the latest episode of 120. My full honest review. Will continue to update review after one or few major arcs.",

            "content": "It is very difficult, borderline impossible, to please everyone. Specially when talking about a follow up to the most iconic  worldwide famous and influential anime in history that, to had explosives to the mix, saw generations of viewers grow and mature during the +30 years of it's existence.\r\nThe Dragon Ball franchise is indeed still to this day the most recognizable across the world as grandmas in south america, US, Europe or Australia will know Goku somehow. DB became part of Pop culture forever and this helps understanding all the mess that are most  opinions about it.\r\nFrom immense nostalgia that will make some rateit 10 out of 10 no matter what, to immense frustration because DBS fails to provide the same feelings than 10-20 years ago (mostly because viewers have matured along the way) resulting in very low ratings, one should focus and try to make a fair judgment of it.\\n\\n\r\nThat's where i come in.\\n\\n\r\nDBS started by annoying people in 2 ways.\\n\\n\r\n1- It tells once again the story of Battle of Gods and Revival of F.\\n\\n\r\n* About that, people should know that the movies were made to \"feel out\" the public reaction to a new series. As it was a success and these movies were at the basis of a new story line, it would obviously be retold in the series once that most people didn't saw the movies. DBS is a complete story and could not start from a point that many would not know about. So, this should not be seen as a bad thing but a normal one.\\n\\n\r\n2- Animation.\\n\\n\r\n* It is universally known that some episodes, specially the infamous n\u00ba5, was a disgrace that shook Toei itself to the point that Toryiama had to speak out. Nevertheless, along the story of DBS, there as been marvelous animation too. Also, the process that is managing resources in an anime like this one is actually pretty normal and seen both in DBZ and many other long term running series. In other words, animation fluctuates depending of the team responsible for it and usually achieves it peak when the arcs are in key episodes. No one knowledgeable about anime will expect a long running series being done weekly to have the same degree of quality that shows with 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe impact of these 2 problems still remain to this day and strongly influence opinions across the board. Even if the new arcs have been very interesting (Goku black was amazing and one of the bests ever) and animation really improved.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that people always mention are the same old plot holes.  \\n\\n\r\nAgain complaining abut that is kind of useless because they always were part of Dragon Ball. Even if they are annoying and piss off what is now an adult audience, fat is that much of the conversation about DB is made around these plot holes. And conversation, weather we like it or not, is what makes this anime popular and timeless.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, DBS has been very good since the end of the movies retold. I ve seen character development, beautiful animations, epic moments, nostalgia to bring tears to the eyes, excitement and this childish curiosity about the next episodes that we all had when kids.\\n\\n\r\nI truly appreciate what Toriyama is doing for the community and the way he gives what people WANT to see (Trunks moments, Vegeta moments, Goku breaking llimits,  that fusion we all wanted to see, new births introducing characters as babies once again etc).\\n\\n\r\nAnime, specifically Dragon Ball, is to me a door way to my childhood and teenage years. It brings me joy like no other anime can.\\n\\n\r\n Although i am aware of it's flaws, i am also an adult that can separate them from basic judgemental rants and understand why they exist. A few poorly animated episodes and some minor plot holes are nothing when compared to what DBS has been doing for many millions of fans across the world.\\n\\n\r\nI'll rate if 9/10 because of the fact that Super has been giving us many of the things we wanted to see, is successful in re creating the old nostalgia, has given character development and kept people hooked to it like always.\\n\\n\r\nReally, nothing can top that. We must understand what DBS is in order to fairly rate it.",

            "content": "Spoilers incoming.\r\nStory: 3/10. The extent of DBSuper's narrative is basically \"Villain appears, Goku fights but loses, Vegeta gets time to shine, Goku comes back and puts up a good fight but loses again, world is saved\". Most of the arcs within Super are predictable (excluding Goku Black, which tried to be something different but fell short as well), and most of the characters are shafted or given superficial moments of 'character development' to make it seem like they're relevant. Don't let this fool you: DBSuper is solely about Goku, and everyone else is just there to make Goku shine brighter than ever. If you're aGoku fanboy, you'll LOVE Super; if you wanted to see other characters get their time in the spotlight, or wanted an interesting narrative filled with deeper themes and good character development, you're fresh out of luck. Although, the latter really never was a staple of the DB franchise, but Super definitely manages to be the worst of the three in presenting superficial plots and characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10. DBSuper had a pretty rough start in terms of animation and art; in fact, DBZ's Saiyan saga fights had more intensity and action than Super's, where the fights in the former were only on the planetary destruction level while those of the latter involve beings that can destroy galaxies. The animation prior to the ToP arc is janky, save for the few episodes where Takahashi came in to animate; DBSuper's fight scenes are actually a step down from its predecessor's, which aired nearly 20-30 years before its onset. \\n\\n\r\nThe ToP arc does fix this problem and present us with pretty good animation and art, but it's hard to forget the mediocre at best artwork prior to this. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10. Great soundtrack, although not much diversity. You won't get Falcouner-level music here, but some of the tracks can get you pumped. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10. Every character is a caricature of what their personalities were in DBZ, and most are ignored just to have Goku in the spotlight. The ToP tried to insert some superficial development within our characters (both old and new), but this is, as stated, SUPERFICIAL at best. Jiren comes off as a knock-off Toguro or space Batman rather than an actual original character; he is probably the most one-dimensional character ever presented in DB to date. In DBZ, we got some pretty great character development, namely from the likes of Gohan, Piccolo, Vegeta, heck even Mr. Satan even though he was a joke character. Here everyone is, for the most part, ,static, and Toriyama tries to put on the facade of development by having a cliche scene where Goku thinks about his friends and family and gets stronger or the like.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nGranted, DBZ was never about profound character development or a mature handle of themes; it's basically mindless fighting with characters we love. But those characters I loved in DBZ ended up as characters I can't even respect in DBSuper; there really is no personality to be had in any of these characters other than some singular sentiment that doesn't even spark the driving force of change. Toriyama plays it safe here and doesn't want his characters to change, which makes Super just consist of a series of events rather than an actual engaging narrative where I care about what happens and who's involved .\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10. If you shut off your brain and just watch for fun, you'll have some good times. The ToP specifically has some great fight scenes, and whenever our main character Goku takes the spotlight, Super is sure to be at its best in terms of animation, art, sound, etc. Other than that, you'll get somewhat interesting fights, nothing too noteworthy. If you're a fan of plot armor powerups and multitudes of super saiyan transformations, you'll be in love with Super too; pretty sure we have atleast 5 of the 7 colors of the rainbow in super saiyan transformations at this point.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10. Some say the hate at Super stems from DBZ fanboys who watched the show as kids and are blinded by nostalgia. I only watched DBZ in its entirety a few months ago, and having watched through DBSuper, the same charm and intensity is completely absent from the sequel. This is probably one of the more subpar shonens I've watched so far, and the only reason it's as popular as it is isn't due to any good writing on Toriyama's part, but rather from Toriyama riding on the coattails of his past work's legacy.",

I grew up watching Dragon ball and Dragon ball Z, while these anime are far from perfect, especially with childhood nostalgia removed from the equation, they still possess qualities which make them enjoyable in their own right. I went into Super wanting to enjoy it, to be filled with warm and fuzzies as I reminisce. What I got was a rerun of the latest films, only less enjoyable and with worse animation, which is to be expected given the budget and time a film has when compared to the averageseries. \\n\r\nFollowed by a frivolous tournament arc, which i can't even remember. Now time for Goku black, probably the highlight of the series.\\n\r\nJiren, a character written for the purpose of giving Goku some competition in the tournament of power, to basically stop Goku dominating. A character with a single dimension and cliche, crappy back story. Every other Dragon ball character we have known over the years is cast aside to let Goku be the raving center of attention, no body else matters any more. Power scaling is completely thrown out and remember how long it took our main protagonists in DB and DBZ to increase their power? pfft forget that, now anyone can make exponential LEAPS in strength in a few episodes. Remember when Goku first achieved SSJ, how much of an achievement that like, the legendary transformation. Well forget all that, now all you need to achieve that is a good nights sleep and a hearty breakfast. Want that new form? Don't need to train for it, just dig really deep, okay? Granted this started in the Buu saga in DBZ, which I also didn't enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude what has been a pretty messy review, I wanted to like super, but everything was against me:\\n\\n\r\n- Bad writing\\n\r\n- Bad continuity (Character development from the previous series gone)\\n\r\n- Bad pacing\\n\r\n- Power scaling\\n",

            "content": "This might be one of the worst shounen out there. None of the charm and essence of DBZ is in this cash-cow milked sequel. It's clear this series was just made to take the DB trademark and ring all the money it could from it; and since fans of DB get hyped if Goku is taking a dump, you can bet they succeeded in making money off this sequel by putting in the least work possible.\r\nStory: 1/10. First off, the entire world of Super feels so contrived and bland for how much the show tries to expand it. There's all this talk of multiple universesbut nothing interesting comes from it. There was a DB fanfiction manga, DB Multiverse or something, that made more out of the idea of universes and parallelism between universes than this show did. None of the characters among the universes are interesting, and the actual fact that other universes exist is trivial because we never see how these universes evolved or if there are Goku/Vegeta/Gohan/etc - counterparts within these universes. The writer could've easily said \"these fighters came from other planets\" and nothing would've changed; the word 'universe' is thrown around to artificially have stakes that don't really amount to anything.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the story of Super isn't really deep or profound. You could say the same of Z, but I'd disagree there. At least Z had a coming of age story with Gohan, or Goku avenging his people and proving Saiyan dominance over a tyrant in the Frieza saga. With Super, you just get linear fights for the sake of it, with no depth to the story at all. It's all about changing your hair color to win. Of course Z established that precedent, but even then it tried putting layers to the idea with Saiyan transformations paralleling a desire/emotion for success, and the Cell saga imposed limitations on the SSJ transformation that warranted the saiyans trying to find new ways to surpass their power. Super doesn't do any of that, and is probably the worst shounen to date in terms of power scaling.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10. Inconsistent and lazy. The ToP does have better art though. I'd say the first 2/3 of the show have a 2/10 art rating but the ToP has around a 5 or 6.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10. The soundtrack has a few good tracks but overall nothing memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10. Every character you loved in Z is either irrelevant or stripped of his dimensionality and turned into a caricature of his former self. Vegeta is just a grumpy dude, and Goku is idiotic and naive but of course is able to get all the special powerups because he's the main character. There was a certain wittiness and determination to Vegeta in Z that made him likable and strong-willed which is just gone now. Likewise, Goku was naive in DBZ but not as dumb as he is now. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10. Turn your brain off and you'll get some ok fights, except not really because somehow the choreography and direction of Super is miles below Z, which came out 30 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10. Only thing good to come out of this show is the FighterZ videogame and even then that game got old real quick. +1 for trying though.\\n\\n",

            "content": "As a child Dragon Ball Z was among some of the first anime I was ever introduced to, along with the rest of the shows that aired on the toonami back in the day. I still have such fond memorizes of forcing myself to stay up on Saturday nights just to watch DBZ, Naruto, One Piece, and even Prince of Tennis of all things. So like most I got very hyped when we all learned that Dragon Ball was coming back with a new entry into the series...unfortunitly the hype didn't last as the first two arcs of the show were poor rehashes of thelast two movies. A bit of promise showed in the Universe 6 tournament, but quickly burned out mid Goku black arc and eventually died out at the tournament of power. So that's my quick run down of DBS if you don't feel like reading any more of this, but for those who wish to stay I'm gonna go arc by arc explaining my likes and dislikes of them.\\n\\n\r\nBattle Of Gods & Resurrection F:\\n\r\nWhat's not to love about having your show start with a slow, unenjoyable retelling of the last two DBZ movies. honestly a lot of my gripes just come from the fact that these two arcs are a bit one the redundant side for anyone who's seen their movie counterparts. I understand that not every might have seen them but when the animation is as awful as it was for both arcs, I'M LOOKING AT YOU EPISODE 5, then why bother animating them at all. Along with Toei animations inablity to animate these arcs there was a lot of fluff added that didn't need to happen. The best example being the return of Captain Ginyu, while I'm not saying Tagoma was this super interesting character that I hated to see go, this just felt like a shameless attempt to spark some nostalgia for fans of DBZ. The fights in these two arcs just feel so lifeless compared to their movie versions, with the only on close to being as good as the movies being SSG Goku Vs Beerus. On the brighter side of things the more light hearted episodes were a treat to watch, and felt like I was watching the OG dragon ball with their emphasis on Dragon Ball's more comedic half.\\n\\n\r\nUniverse 6 Tournament:\\n\r\nEverything this arc does makes me wish the rest of the series was more like this! The world building knowledge bomb that is the fact that there are multiple universes opens the door for all sorts of possibilities, making me at first think DBS might take a more GT style story where goku and the gang would go from universe to universe meeting new allies and fighting strong new foes, but boy was I wrong. The cast of U6 charaters we are introduced to are all a treat, with the exception of Botamo and Magetta. From the hillarious duo of Champa and Vados, to they plucky young saiyan Cabba, the dirty cheat Frost, and of course my personal favorite character from all of DBS the hitman Hit. While the first matches against Botamo and Magetta were pretty much just warm ups for Goku and Vegeta the action starts to pick up with the fight of Piccolo Vs. Frost and they only get better and better with the peak being the fantastic fight of Goku Vs Hit. This fight is personally the best fight in the whole of DBS for me, it reminds us that Goku is a talented fighter who is quick to adapt to Hit's OP Time Stop ability. Though Hit is just as skilled of a fighter and still continues to put the pressure on Goku even in SSB, leading to the amazing return of the Kaioken which helps push this fight up to one of the best fights in all of Dragon Ball. Most importantly GOKU LOST A FIGHT, a rarity for Dragon Ball, which left the impression that while Goku has grown the other universes could be filled with fighters who are as strong if not even more powerful than him. Needless to say I could go on till the cows come home about how I love this arc but I'll do us all a favor and move on.\\n\\n\r\nGoku Black: \\n\r\nSo back when I watched DBZ Trunks was my favorite character, like come on the dude had a sword whats not to love. So hearing that this arc was gonna mark the return of Trunks I was pretty excited, that was until I saw that he had blue hair instead of its usual lavender color. I know this is a really nitpicky sort of thing but in scenes that have both version of trunks it's extremely annoying to see kid Trunks with the right hair color and then future Trunks has that damn blue hair color. Of course with future Trunks back that means so is the time machine, and good kami do they use and abuse that poor time machine for this arc. With there being no minions for Goku and Vegeta to fight it means all fights have to be against Goku Black and/or Zamasu so when one side is one the ropes they just jump to the present or future to stretch this arc out far too long. On top of that since these villains are as strong as they are it means Vegeta has to do a lot of jobbing to show off the strength of these foes which is a real shame since it only gets worse for Vegeta from here.  The arc could have been resolved easily since Trunks learns and uses the Evil Containment Wave on Zamasu, but Goku being Goku accidentally left the seal for the container back in the present. Thankfully this blonder on Goku's part leads to the return of the mighty fusion fighter Vegito, which you quickly find out is just another nostalgia trip when he is gone almost as quickly as he came. Only to give the win to Trunk with an admittedly super cool final clash using the spirit sword, but my big grip is how is there enough people left on earth in the destroyed future to give any meaningful amount of energy to the spirit bomb turned sword. Even still that doesn't kill Zamasu and he has to get ctrl alt deleted by Zenoh because this arc has gone on for far too long. This arc could have really been better if there wasn't so much time line hopping and Vegeta jobbing.\\n\\n\r\nTournament of Power:\\n\r\nTHIS ARC IS WHY THIS SERIES DROPPED FOR A 6 TO A 4 FOR ME! For one we already had a tournament arc two arcs ago, but more importantly this tournament was just poorly done. With this tournament being an 80 person 8 way team free for all with a 48 minute time limit, it was clear from the start that it was going to be a hot mess. We have to get introduced to 75 new fighters and 10 sets of god of destruction, angel, and supreme kai's and almost all of them are gone before we even learn the most basic things about them, and those that we do get to learn about are awful, with the exception of of the delightfully bombastic Toppo. Seeing as each universe is a team of 10 lets talk about them. Universes 9, 10, 4, 3, and the majority of 2 are irrelevant and only exist for the big players of Universes 6, 11 and 7 to beat senseless as a warm up for their later fights between these three universes. Speaking of universe 7 lets talk about our 10 fighters, while the majority of the team makes a lot of sense it's a bit odd that the human fighters are here since they are unfortunately highly out classed by many of these higher tier fighters. While Krillin and Master Roshi are given their time to shine in this tournament, one questions why Tien was included if he was only going to get eliminated in the most unceremonious way possible(see Plague of Gripes video on Tien for more info). To avoid this part of the review being me complaining about every fight I hate and just simply say that 90% of these fights are awful and only get good once the only universes left are 6, 7, and 11. unfortunately for U6 almost all of the time spent showing their fighters is spent on the highly controversial saiyan duo of Kale and Caulifla(that's a rant for another time). Once these fussed together saiyan ladies get a hot load of kamehameha to the face, we can get to the real fight Goku Vs the buff ayyy lmoa alien...I mean Jiren which was honestly a cool fight but it just dragged out way too long. OH MY KAMI DOES JIREN\"S MOTIVATION SUCK. It's not like it's impossible to make a motivation like seeking power to avenge your family only become power hungry good, just look at Toguro from Yu Yu Hakusho for a perfect execution of that very same motivation.  It was so powerful to see Android 17 sacrifice himself for Goku and Vegeta, but it lost all of it impact when he just suddenly shows up at the climax to help finish off Jiren and then wish back everyone that was erased as a result of the tournament. There was one redeeming factor for me this entire arc, and that was MORE FRIEZA BABY!  Though no amount of screen time from my favorite DBZ villain could save this arc from being the worst thing in all of DBS for me\\n\\n\r\nObviously I didn't go too in depth with is review because lets be honest you and I both don't want to be bothered with reading some ten page long rant about how I feel DBS is alright but all of its attempts to play off DBZ nostalgia and the hot mess that was the tournament of power really made me go from liking the series to mildly annoyed with it. If it wasn't clear enough this is my first review so this probably sucks but I don't care.",

And when I'm older and retired I might just find a bit of my forgotten past in the Dragon Ball franchise. It has notonly entertained me but helped me form bonds that to this day aren't broken. \\n\\n\r\nBut onto a more technical review , regardless of my feelings towards DBZ , back when i started It was just another cartoon yet somehow this specific one ( Dragon Ball ) stood out above POKEMON, Yu-Gi-Oh and the rest. It was a mixture of the humour , fight scenes and the story that all managed to appeal to my younger self. When growing older Dragon Ball Z was released and this was about the time i stopped watching POKEMON , DBZ however matured along with my tastes where the stakes became higher , the villains more sinister and the characters more emotional and the art rose to meet my expectations. \\n\\n\r\nA few years later Dragon Ball Super shocked us die hard fans by maturing even more to suit their loyal viewers. Art improved drastically as well as sound effects ( compared to DBZ and DB ) As for the story , the stakes has literally never been higher , new characters influencing current characters and despite all these changes it still has the core elements of the good old days. Say what you want but the Dragon Ball franchise has done what had to be done in order to survive and I'd say they did a damn good job , it's like a good wine , only gets better with age. \\n\\n\r\nAs Krillin once said :  \"Hey Goku, you're my friend. We grew up together. Just make sure that...that we both grow old together too.\" I can also say that I grew up with DB and DBZ and now I will grow old with whatever they have in store for the future.",

They should end this series and never start Dragonball again and just leave at the Original or maybe do the Goku story again but with updated Animation.

            "content": "Hey guys, I am here to give a review on Dragon Ball Super. To sum up it all up, I am disappointed. I will also be reviewing all the arcs too.\r\nStory - Overall: 5\r\nThe story is basic and takes a certain amount of time after the Buu Saga.\r\nThe hate for this anime is understandable. The dread like we had with the Androids, Frieza, Cell or Buu is non-existent. You can ignore the 20 to 30 episodes and jump to the U6 Tournament arc. Anime wise, I would give the Battle of Gods arc and the Resurrection of Frieza arc a 5/10\r\nThe Universe 6 Tournament Arc-3/10\\n\r\nThis arc was a mess, the art was horrible, the fights were horrible and the consistency was even worse. Don\u2019t get me started on the lack of danger. The Consistency is just horrible, Goku using Kaioken with SSB was horrible and does not help the series at all. The fights lacked danger and were predictable. The most disappointing part was when Piccolo quit. My rating for this arc is a 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe Black Goku Arc- 5.5/10\\n\r\nThis arc is probably the best that the anime adaptation can ever provide. The future is once again being attacked by Goku\u2019s lookalike. Sadly enough, the lookalike was immediately predicted to be Zamasu, and what\u2019s even worse is that they are both Mary Sue\u2019s too. Both gaining power through getting hurt. Future Trunks was unconscious for 6 hours, but nobody killed him. He was rendered useless right there. The power levels became extremely inconsistent in this arc. SS2 Trunks is apparently equal to Black. Zamasu is apparently as strong as SSB, even though he was equal to SS2 Goku earlier. What is even worse is Trunks pulling a Super Saiyan form out of his ass and using friendship power to kill the villain. There are too many problems in this arc and that is disappointing. The constant trips to the future and back will bore you to tears, and the predictability is ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nUniversal Survival Arc- 4.5/10\\n\r\nWe finally get to where we are now and all I can say is if you want characters to talk for ages then keep watching. If you want Goku\u2019s SSB form to be degraded further, then keep on watching. In the Universal Tournament Arc, you have Goku and the others fight other universes in a battle royal. \\n\r\nThis was disappointing, as I mentioned above, all the fighters do is talk. Apparently, everyone can match SSB and quite a lot of the new characters are like Mary Sues who just get stronger because they have the power within them, Caulifla and Kale being the best examples. This also hardly as any involvement from Toriyama himself, if you all want to see Toriyama involve himself completely, then read the manga. The worst part of this all is how badly explained the plot points are, Goku gaining a new form through no explanation was horrible. The way the Earthlings were treated throughout the arc was even worse. Guess what folks, Vegeta might be shit on, Gohan will definitely get shit on and for all we know the tournament could be a waste of time. The sense of dread is gone, since we all know U7 will survive at the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 4\\n\r\nNow despite the fact there really hasn't been too much progression with lots of these characters. The only characters that get remotely any attention is either Goku or Vegeta.\\n\\n\r\nGoku- The character has been serverly degraded into a child\\n\r\nVegeta- The only character that as development\\n\r\nPiccolo- Thrown away, like Gohan\\n\r\nMaster Roshi, Krillin, Tien and Yamcha- Thrown away\\n\r\nBeerus and the other Gods of the universes have ample development. The same can be said about the angels (Whis, Vados etc)\\n\\n\r\nArt - 5\\n\r\nThe art is deplorable and it is probably the worst part of DBS in general. Everyone is a child in comparison to how they used to look. If you want an example, then look at Tien from Z and look at him now.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nThe characters overall have great voice acting. King Kai is probably the only exception, the soundtrack is alright and the opening themes are probably the only good things about this series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4\\n\r\nThis is indeed the worst sequel to Z ever. Yes, even GT is better than this garbage. So far, the only thing good about this series is the fact that it is a continuation of Z. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 4/10\\n\r\nI recommend reading the manga, which is probably the place for every fan that wants something like Z. Sadly, Toei as spat on what was once a great franchise and made it look total garbage. \\n\\n",

            "content": "First off, this will be a mostly negative review. I say this upfront because I know there are hardcore fans who don't want to waste their time, I understand.\r\nI was not impressed with, nor did I enjoy all 90 (up to date (99), but I skim them) eps of Super. It is hard for me to pinpoint the reason(s) and form them into words. (There will be light spoilers, I'll try my best to keep them vague (hard to review a show without talking about it))\r\nI will total ignore the animation we all were abuzz about, because it has gotten way better. I feel thisis the most important thing to think about when talking about this; Super is different from Z, and Z is different from Dragon Ball. They all have different tones and focuses, so many of the complaints could very well be a preference thing and not a \"it's bad\" thing. Okay, real talk.\\n\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super has been a piano recital with missed keys. The ideas are cool, they get the blood pumping and the mind abuzz with ideas about what will come next, but then they seem to miss their mark. They set up a cool story and then it doesn't have a climax, or they have some drama that is under cut with to much comedy. It really seems like they think they can get us to watch it off namesake only.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, they made us rewatch the movies, with some changes to them, which was annoying, half because we already saw it, and half because what took a movie an hour forty-five, took them fourteen eps (five hours) to tell us the same thing. Then they did it again with Fukkatsu No F, Hour thirty became thirteen eps. \\n\\n\r\nThe fights are as well a let down, but to be fair most of them have been since Frieza (even if it took like four hours (Never forget)). I know Teen Gohan is raw, and you likes Buu, but really, to be completely honest, the best fight in Dragon ball, Z or otherwise, is probably Goku (and friends) vs Vegeta, and that is what Super should be doing. That fight takes five eps, and it's awesome. They don't just punch for five eps, everyone involved almost dies and it feels like a real struggle, like each hit means the difference in winning, or losing. Not just that fight though, but the whole of Z from start to Frieza. It had weight, and character development; it had growth and over arching plot threads. You had connected villains leading one into the next, you have a build and a climax after each villain, and capping it off with (at the time) *THE* villain, in a thematic battle for the universe, for Goku's loved ones, and for his whole race, ending (So we thought) the galaxies worst threat; it was cool, it was great, it is what you think about when you think \"Dragon Ball Z\". Super just misses it's mark on these things. You get build, Trunks is back with a cool new villain (Can't the future just get a break), it has real drama again, it makes you start thinking of what or how there can be two Goku's, \"Is one evil, dragon balls?, Alt time line?. They gear up to go help Trunks, almost die and then they just have a party and laugh it off before trying again. Trunks is the only one who feels like maybe we should take this more seriously. They have this cool story, neat villains and real drama again, and it's undercut with out of place comedy. Then the end of that arch (I won't say it, but if you've seen it, there is a *big* goofy problem you already know I was going to bring up)\\n\\n\r\nI really feel weird about it, I want to like it so much, I want to be able to add Super to my collection with the rest of Dragon Ball (yes, I even own GT), but it just makes me upset. I feel like it's ruining my favorite characters and a series I grew up with, something I hold close to my heart. Dragon Ball has never been a masterpiece, it has never had the best writing, fights, animation, etc, but it was cool, it had a neat story, it made you want to become strong and protect your friends and loved ones, it made you want to train to fight evil. Super seems like it's trying to go through the motions, but it doesn't remember how.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it's whether or not you enjoy yourself. If you like it, keep watching, if you don't, then don't. These are just my feelings on it, they don't change how you feel about it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nSuper feels like it lost it's groove and can't hold onto a real plot or build drama anymore.

The old characters are caricatures of themselves, the new characters are either boring or just downright unbearable, and the plot points are beyond ridiculous. This anime has no consistency and runs on pure nostalgia. I've defended Super for a while now due to my love for the DB franchise that goes back all the way to the 90s, but even I have a limit. \r\nI'm sure I don't even have to mention the god awful animation this show has. For one of the most decorated and recognizable  anime series in the world, the way Toei treats the showis insulting. The writing is equally as atrocious as the writers at Toei are obviously more interested in selling toys and merchandise than writing a coherent story.\\n\\n\r\nPeople love to rag on GT, but at this point in Super, GT was actually a better show as a whole. Yes GT had a whole host of problems on it's own, but at least it tried to keep consistency with the original series. And Goku in GT acted more like an adult despite him being turned into a kid than Goku in Super who seems to be legitimately clinically retarded. Super throws logic out the window just for the sake of selling merchandise. Super is the lowest of the low and should be treated like GT has been treated for the past two decades; a mistake.",

Dragon Ball was an anime that I appended all of it without watching, but that does not make me able to comment on the work as a whole as if it had that ability.\r\nHistory: Well what to talk about it, only part 2 of the anime there is a story (Arc of the Trunks of the Future), the rest? Not\r\nSpeaking of this bow, he has a good development of history, well done, without many thefts, that is, it is medium and legal. That simple.\r\nArt: Good art, keep what weknow of Dragon Ball, characters with good traits, many people could give a smaller note by preferring the old one, but this does not happen to me. Nothing to complain about about art, note 8!\\n\r\nSound Production: In most anime? Bad, in the Power Tournament? Well done Nothing much and different, just action songs for an anime fight.\\n\r\nCharacters: My 4th note is only for one character: Zamasu. He was the only personage developed throughout the anime. It was a character with an interesting plot, which combines with Dragon Ball, in addition to a legal development! Only this.\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super is a weak anime, where the focus is on fights, transformations, and the protagonist. Only one bow was decent and well worked, the rest is dispensable for the whole story. As someone said in a review, just take a bow that will not make any difference, I think this is the biggest problem, an anime made to get fans nostalgia, and money, that's all.",

            "content": "Story: 2/10. The story of DBSuper is uninteresting and aimless. There is no cohesive goal or narrative other than 'get stronger', so every arc just feels disjointed and doesn't seem to serve any greater purpose. This would be fine if each arc was individually strong with its own strong sense of story, themes and characters, but alas there is nothing compelling about DBSuper in any of these areas. \r\nThe characters are bland, there are no themes to be had in the plot and the story of every arc never extends past \"fight this strong villain and try to win\". Even though DB and DBZ employedthis same formula to its arcs, there were still stakes aside from saving the world/universe/whatever that really helped make the story; whether it was personal character goals and aspirations or the coming of age of certain characters, these two shows really nailed not just focusing on bigger and badder stakes to tell a story (for the most part). Unfortunately, DBSuper thinks bigger stakes = better story and fails as a result. \\n\\n\r\nAs an aside, there is little to no tension in the story regardless of how big the stakes are. I felt more tension in DBZ watching two non-Super Saiyans fight each other than I did watching literal god-level beings clash in Super. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10. Everyone knows DBSuper had its fair share of problems when it was coming out in terms of art and animation. But the series does get way better as it progresses. I'd say starting out the art/animation was maybe a 2 or 3/10 but by the end of the series it's probably a 7/10. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. Pretty great soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10. The worst written characters I've seen in literally anything, not just anime. The depth every character had in DB and DBZ has been extracted out and all we're left with are shells of characters, caricatures of what they once were. Everyone you knew and loved in DBZ is either ignored or reduced to one or two personality traits. DBZ was guilty of doing this to a degree, but DBSuper takes it to a whole other level. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of development, it seems Super equates changing one's hair color with substantial character development. There is not an ounce of interesting development in any of the characters excluding one villain who is mediocre at best. Watching DBSuper is like watching a bunch of cardboard cutouts fly and punch each other really hard and then end the day screaming really hard. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10. Some fights are ok to watch, I also had nostalgia-feels watching the sequel to one of the first animes I was exposed to and have rewatched several times (DBZ). But even then there was clearly something off with DBSuper. I felt no tension in any of the arcs, and most of the fights did not captivate me the way even the simple, inconsequential fights of DB and DBZ did. I couldn't even turn off my brain to enjoy the fights because the fights weren't even choreographed well. If you're going to write a story that doesn't have interesting characters, themes or plot, at least make it fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10. DBSuper is a contender for the worst battle shounen of all time. It is a shameful legacy to DB and DBZ and I'm surprised it's so popular when it just does the bare, BAREST minimum (not even) in terms of its story and characters. I would give this a 1/10 but the soundtrack is pretty good and the last arc of the series does have 1 or 2 good fights, so +1 for that I guess. Other than that watch literally anything else for a better time.",

But don't worry the series are still circlejerking around Goku through the entire series. Goku is \"the man\" he will always save the day and I mean ALWAYS.\r\nI am so tired of seeing this overused plotmachine called Goku. Don't even dare to give any excuses how this is acceptable. Goku is running around with godmodeon and isn't even interested what he is facing more than half of the time. There is never any sense of danger or trouble because he exists.\\n\\n\r\nLets talk more about character development in Super. ITS ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS. \\n\r\nAny character can suddenly be on the level of Goku if the plot demands it and apparently writers thought this was a great idea. Its not. Not only does this type of writing make the story and the past events completely meaningless it makes characters that worked their way to the top weaker than most of the other characters that were lightyears away from reaching others.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation. My god this awful animation. It gets better eventually when the show goes further but it has become meme at this point because of how bad it was at the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThere is really nothing to say about this show or maybe I just don't feel like writing any longer than this.

The fight choreography is great but still pales in comparison to Z. Music is generally forgettable with the exception of a couple of tunes. Had some memorable characters like Zamasu, Goku Black, Caulifla, and Hit. Powerscaling was god-awful and due to the nature of the show this aspect was more obvious and painful to watch.Its highs were truly spectacular but that doesn't make up for its plastic animation, unstructured & shallow story, fan-pampering shenanigans, and questionable character portrayals most of the time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it disappoints in comparison to its predecessors.

However the case of 'Dragon Ball Super' is worse than that. After the obvious bad reception of the non-canonical series of 'Dragon Ball GT' is removed '... Super' in this case if it is a canonical sequel to 'Dragon Ball Z'. But the canonical title remains in almost nothing good that has this series.\r\nHistory (2/10)\r\nGoing by part, this series starts with arcs that are in themselves quite mediocre, but when the most ambitiousand original arches arrive, they turn out to be even worse than those who did not have this because of the terrible narrative they have, to the point where even the characters major of the sagas, less Trunks of the Future and Mai are totally flat.\\n\\n\r\n-Arc of the Battle of the Gods (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis arc introduces something positive that could have had much more focus the series but ended up being ignored staying alone in a vacuum power-up convenient to the whim of the direction. That something turns out to be the expansion of the Ki, but not in power, if not finally show us in the series the scope of the operation of this and its different types. The introduction of the Divine Ki seemed something that could have worked but for a constant power-up. But its explanation of use is so poor that it is never made clear how it is achieved in a concrete way, ending as I said before in stupid convenience. Although the Divine Ki ended up being another type of force that more in the brute hits ended in the more mental and full control of the Ki being an interesting field, the series does not explain it well here, nor does it later. Bills ends up being a waste no more than someone powerfully idle who does not do anything relevant.\\n\\n\r\n-Arch of the Resurrection of Freezer (1/10)\\n\\n\r\nIf it was not much, this arc is even worse, where the series not only leads a bad course, it also destroys the rationale and rules that we had previously of the power and its levels, arriving Frieza, who only had just a few weeks to reach power of a God and passing to Majin Buu when the same Buu was millions of times more powerful than Frieza, and if the illogical of this is not enough it ends up reaching the similar level of a Super Saijayin Blue God, where they are excused with the bad handling of their new transformation so that from nowhere Goku again beat Frieza and the stupidity of Goku and Vegeta, Frieza ends up destroying the earth, where perhaps the saga could have been redeemed by expanding the arc in a more intelligent post-destruction of the Earth , but Whiss takes a shameless convenience out of nothing, returns everything to how it was before, and Goku kills Frieza, again.\\n\\n\r\n-Arc of the Tournament of the Universe 7 vs 6 (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nAt least this arc was some fresh air to the series improving some quality, where the characters at least have motivations and are less flat. Unfortunately, they again waste the potential of Majin Buu making him look like a useless child being disqualified from the tournament for not knowing how to write, something illogical. At least the characters of universe 6 are somewhat less flat, and we can see at least Cabba and Hit that have something interesting, because Frost is nothing more than the cliche of the other you who in the end ends up being pathetic. And Hit and Cabba, despite their potential, do not take advantage of it and end with luck in the mini-arch where Hit should kill Goku, where we end up knowing something at least of universe 6 and its society.\\n\\n\r\n-Arc of Black Goku (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis arc is very deceiving, because it seems interesting and they use the resource of basically the best DBZ character, Future Trunks to give it something more seriousness. But the villains end up being a complete mess, where they seem to be sadistic because they never clarify or expand the plot to why Zamas or Black hate humans so much, and the resolution of all this that comes after the series goes in circles constantly from the past to the future, everything is resolved by a plot convenience of biblical proportions. The only rescue of this arch is gracefully the presence of 'Trunks' because like the Cell saga ends up being the most reasoned character of all.\\n\\n\r\n-Arc of the Power Tournament (1/10)\\n\\n\r\nAnd here the worst arc away from the series. The writing and development of the plot in this arc is extremely mediocre, not only because they keep you in the same for several episodes and send everything to the bottom which meant the effort in Dragon Ball Z as a key to get power, besides this, the dialogos are totally ridiculous and the values \u200b\u200bof a hero are destroyed, not to mention that the development of the main rival of Universe of Goku and company has not a single development besides the little development of Toppo, and hardly 1 minute of which they speak of the past of Jiren to explain in a certain way why it is so strong. And that they never focus because Jiren is so exaggeratedly strong the point of being stronger than almost all the Gods of Destruction. That Vegeta 'maximizes the power of the Blue SSJ', which by the way only obscures the color of his hair and eyes, is only a convenience to defeat Toppo with the powers of God. The selfish doctrine is something cool, but only in something, because in the end its proposal is more interesting than the SSJ Blue God, but in the end they never explain why it is activated, and out of nowhere Goku dominates it to pass to Jiren and that Frieza and Goku can get it out. The only redeemable thing that this bow has is that the least flat and most intelligent character of the whole tournament was at the end. And although the desire could not be more obvious, it was the logical thing coming from the winner. It's funny to think that the theories of an evil Daishinkan have saved something in this saga. So mediocre was the writing of this saga and the series? Totally disappointing and a poor and cutting end.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art at the beginning seems to be done quickly without desire, and throughout the series ends up being something better for when at the end of the saga has something of redeemable things, like the lights and the appearance of the last state of Goku to enter.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is OK, neither good nor bad, it happens, it has good melodies especially in Black's bow, but in the rest it is poor, without more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (1/10)\\n\\n\r\nDoes Toei hate his saga? Or just want to profit? Because the development of DBS characters is totally pathetic, flat, without personality or motives, in addition to the fact that antagonistic characters do not have a single effort. The manga without being good develops this better.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is so bad and sloppy that even Akira Toriyama complained and dedicated himself to the manga that at least has the desire to offer something else.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10 (Horrible)\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n[Peque\u00f1os Spoilers]\\n\\n\r\nEs realmente malo cuando le haces falsas expectativas a los que esperan cualquier tipo de producto, sea animaci\u00f3n, cine, m\u00fasica, literatura, o cualquier cosa que encierre al arte. Sin embargo el caso de 'Dragon Ball Super' es peor que eso. Luego de la obvia mala recepci\u00f3n de la serie no can\u00f3nica de 'Dragon Ball GT' se saca '...Super' que en este caso si es una secuela can\u00f3nica de 'Dragon Ball Z'. Pero el t\u00edtulo can\u00f3nico se queda en lo casi nada de bueno que tiene esta serie. \\n\\n\r\nHistoria (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nYendo por parte, esta serie empieza con arcos que son de por s\u00ed bastante mediocres, pero cuando los arcos mas ambiciosos y originales llegan, resultan ser a\u00fan peores que los que no ten\u00edan esto por la p\u00e9sima narrativa que tienen, al punto donde incluso los personajes principales de las sagas, menos Trunks del Futuro y Mai sean totalmente planos.\\n\\n\r\n-Arco de la Batalla de los Dioses (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nEste arco introduce algo positivo que podr\u00eda haber tenido mucho mas enfoque la serie pero termin\u00f3 ignor\u00e1ndose qued\u00e1ndose solo en un vac\u00edo power-up conveniente  al antojo de la direcci\u00f3n. Ese algo resulta ser la expanci\u00f3n del Ki, pero no en poder, si no que por fin nos muestran en la serie el \u00e1mbito del funcionamiento de este y sus diferentes tipos. La introducci\u00f3n del Ki Divino parec\u00eda algo que podr\u00eda haber funcionado de no ser por un power-up constante. Pero su explicaci\u00f3n de uso es tan pobre que jam\u00e1s se deja claro como se alcanza de una forma concreta terminando como dije anteriormente en una est\u00fapida conveniencia. A pesar de que el Ki Divino terminara siendo otro tipo de fuerza que mas en los golpes brutos terminaba en el control mas mental y pleno del Ki siendo un \u00e1mbito interesante, la serie ni aqu\u00ed lo explica bien, ni lo hace mas adelante. Bills termina siendo un desperdicio no mas que alguien poderoso ocioso que no hace nada relevante.\\n\\n\r\n-Arco de la Resurrecci\u00f3n de Freezer (1/10)\\n\\n\r\nSi no fuera mucho, este arco es a\u00fan peor, donde la serie no solo lleva un mal rumbo, adem\u00e1s destroza el raciocinio y reglas que ten\u00edamos anteriormente del poder y sus niveles, llegando Freezer, que solo le bast\u00f3 apenas unas semanas para llegar al poder de un Dios y pasando a Majin Buu cuando el mismo Buu era millones de veces mas poderoso que Freezer, y si no basta la il\u00f3gica de esto termina llegando al nivel similar de un Super Saijayin Dios Azul, donde se excusan con el mal manejo de su nueva transformaci\u00f3n para que de la nada Goku vuelva a superar a Freezer y por la estupidez de Goku y Vegeta, Freezer termine destrozando la tierra, donde quiz\u00e1s la saga pudo haberse redimido con expandir el arco de una manera mas inteligente post-destrucci\u00f3n de la Tierra, pero Whiss se saca una conveniencia desvergonzada de la nada, regresa todo a como estaba antes, y Goku mata a Freezer, de nuevo.\\n\\n\r\n-Arco del Torneo del Universo 7 vs 6 (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nAl menos este arco supuso algo de aire fresco a la serie mejorando algo la calidad, donde los personajes al menos tienen motivaciones y son menos planos. Lamentablemente vuelven a desperdiciar el potencial de Majin Buu haci\u00e9ndolo ver como un ni\u00f1o inutil quedando descalificado del torneo por no saber escribir, algo il\u00f3gico. Al menos los personajes del universo 6 son algo menos planos, y podemos ver al menos a Cabba y Hit que tienen algo de interesante, porque Frost no es mas que el clich\u00e9 del otro t\u00fa que al final termina siendo pat\u00e9tico. Y Hit y Cabba a pesar de su potencial no lo aprovechan y terminan con suerte en el mini-arco donde hit debe matar a Goku adelante donde terminamos sabiendo algo al menos del universo 6 y su sociedad.\\n\\n\r\n-Arco de Black Goku (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nEste arco es sumamente enga\u00f1oso, porque parece interesante y usan al recurso de b\u00e1sicamente el mejor personaje de DBZ 'Trunks del Futuro' para darle algo mas de seriedad. Pero los villanos terminan siendo un completo bodrio, donde parecen ser s\u00e1dicos porque s\u00ed, jam\u00e1s aclaran ni expanden la trama al por qu\u00e9 Zamas o Black odian tanto a los humanos, y la resoluci\u00f3n de todo esto que viene despu\u00e9s de que la serie vaya en c\u00edrculos constantemente del pasado al futuro, se resuelva todo por una conveniencia argumental de proporciones b\u00edblicas. Lo \u00fanico rescatable de este arco es graciosamente la presencia de 'Trunks del Futuro' porque al igual que la saga de Cell termina siendo el personaje con mas raciocinio de todos.\\n\\n\r\n-Arco del Torneo del Poder (1/10)\\n\\n\r\nY ac\u00e1 el peor arco lejos de la serie. La escritura y desarrollo de la trama en este arco es sumamente mediocre, no solo porque te mantengan en lo mismo por varios episodios y manden todo al traste lo que supon\u00eda el esfuerzo en Dragon Ball Z como llave para conseguir poder, adem\u00e1s de esto, los dialogos son totalmente rid\u00edculos y los valores de un h\u00e9roe se destrozan, sin mencionar que el desarrollo del principal rival de Universo de Goku y compa\u00f1\u00eda no posea ni un solo desarrollo adem\u00e1s del poco desarrollo de Toppo, y apenas 1 minuto del cual hablan del pasado de Jiren para explicar de cierta forma porqu\u00e9 es tan fuerte. Y eso que jam\u00e1s enfocan porque Jiren es tan exageradamente fuerte el punto de ser mas fuerte que casi todos los Dioses de la Destrucci\u00f3n. Que Vegeta 'active al m\u00e1ximo el poder del SSJ Azul' que por cierto solo le oscurece el color de pelo y ojos, no es mas que una conveniencia para vencer a Toppo con los poderes de Dios. La doctrina ego\u00edsta es algo fresco, pero solo en algo, ya que en el fondo su propuesta es mas interesante que la del SSJ Dios Azul, pero al final jam\u00e1s te explican porqu\u00e9 se activa, y de la nada Goku la domina para pasar a Jiren y que Freezer y Goku puedan sacarlo. Lo \u00fanico rescatable que tiene este arco es que el personaje menos plano y mas inteligente de todo el torneo qued\u00f3 al final. Y a pesar de que el deseo no pudo ser mas obvio, era lo l\u00f3gico vieniendo del ganador. Es gracioso pensar que las teor\u00edas de un Daishinkan malvado hubiesen salvado algo a esta saga. \u00bfTan mediocre fue la escritura de esta saga y la serie? Decepcionante totalmente y un final pobre y cortante.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArte (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nEl arte en un inicio parece ser hecho a la r\u00e1pida sin ganas, y a lo largo de la serie termina siendo algo mejor para cuando ya en el final de la saga tenga algo de cosas rescatables, como las luces y el aspecto el \u00faltimo estado de Goku en introducirse.\\n\\n\r\nSonido (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nEl sonido es un OK, ni bueno ni malo, pasa, tiene melod\u00edas buenas en especial en el arco de Black, pero en el resto es pobre, sin mas.\\n\\n\r\nPersonajes (1/10)\\n\\n\r\n\u00bfAcaso Toei odia su saga? \u00bfo solo quiere lucrar? Porque el desarrollo de personajes de DBS es totalmente pat\u00e9tico, plano, sin personalidad ni motivos, sumado a que los personajes antag\u00f3nicos no tienen ni un solo esfuerzo. El manga sin ser bueno desarrolla esto mejor.\\n\\n\r\nLa serie es tan mala y descuidada que hasta el mismo Akira Toriyama se quej\u00f3 y se dedic\u00f3 al manga que por lo menos tiene las ganas de ofrecer algo mas.\\n\\n\r\nTotal: 2/10 (Horrible)",

            "content": "Dragon Ball Super, after a 3-year journey, has finally come to an end. The sequel to one of the most influential and ragingly popular series that captured the world by storm, that made preteens scream and wish they become a super Saiyan and had them do Kamehameha waves during recess hours in school is a show that unfortunately fails to capture the magic of its predecessors and is terribly misguided as to what made Dragon Ball Z such a great show that impacted a whole generation of not only children but also shounen anime in general. \r\nDragon Ball Super's story is flawed and is definitelyone that will not stand the test of time. The first nail in the coffin was definitely that the show was going to adapt the movies that came out fairly recently (2 years before the broadcast started), this obviously didn't sit well with the audience since the new content would take a long time to release. It didn't help that the adaptation was vastly inferior to the movies (obviously) with shameless padding and terrible animation that looked way worse than the franchise's anime debut 3 decades ago, it took a whopping 8 months for the show to get started on any new content. \\n\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super's NEW content was shamelessly unoriginal, 2 of the 3 main arcs were TOURNAMENT arcs, this obviously meant that there'd be no real effort in world-building, what a waste of potential especially since we just now learned that there were 12 universes opening various opportunities for discovery, adventure, and world-building, but now the majority of the show's narrative would be contained in a martial arts arena, SUPER INTERESTING.  \\n\\n\r\nOne of the arcs i.e. the non-tournament arc had considerable hype surrounding it, the Black Goku arc, it had fan-favorite character Trunks make a return and to top it all off the villain was actually Goku, an evil version of him. It also finally made the show feel like as if there would be drastic consequences, real stakes were there and it certainly had a dark tone to it, there was a mystery to uncover, an intrigue as to the identity of this villain and the first parts of the arc were really good in building it up, but unfortunately the story fell flat and the villain, while interesting and empathetic to an extent became a mindless power hungry meathead who wanted world domination. It had a sloppy ending and the story was entirely self-contained with zero consequences to the world, even Trunks didn't care about his world. \\n\\n\r\nComing to characters, Super has a shockingly terrible understanding of them, the show introduced very weak characters that lack motivation and are shockingly generic, while Dragon Ball Z didn't have very complex characters, it nevertheless made them grounded and loveable, introducing characters that were very focused on their ideals, their desires, and motivations. Vegeta's pride and his insecurities led him to become Majin Vegeta and led to a fight that was extremely gratifying and even cathartic, it gave him closure to his insecurities, his insecurities were erased and thus he went on to sacrifice himself to save the world i.e. his son Trunks. Gohan too had a similarly interesting character arc. The reason I'm talking about this is because DBS has severely stunted character growth and hasn't established their driving motivation, all characters are either forgettable or are the same as when they started out. The show is just mindless fighting offering no insight as to the character's ideals with nothing more than a desire to \"save their world\". \\n\\n\r\nHit is merely reactionary and doesn't have any will of his own making for a very uninteresting character, but honestly, he is by far the best new character of Super which is saying something. And Jiren, ooohhh boii, definitely the worst main antagonist of the franchise if not in shounen history. First of all, he is such an incoherent character, he started off as this self-righteous and almost majestic villain that I'd argue had some depth to him and then BAM he has a backstory that is extremely derivative, shockingly generic and very insulting to the character, because almost instantly he becomes \"evil\" and says generic evil things like \"strength is absolute\", \"lament your weakness\", \"friends are useless\" and it just totally destroys him and really insults the viewer's intelligence because Jiren finally becomes a generic villain that makes Goku look good rather than someone who was calm, calculating, self-righteous and pursued something \"beyond strength\". It doesn't help that his design is mediocre and that he looks like Buu in the final episodes. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Super's stories and characters are mediocre at best and insulting at worst, power scaling is something Super seemingly throws out the window making even the notion of Gods ultimately pointless because even normal people like Trunks, Kale and Caulifla master it within minutes to a day and that is insulting and makes for poor, unlikeable characters. I still can't shake off the fact that Goku, someone who has fought the God of Destruction on equal footing and is trained by the even stronger Angel Whis struggles to pummel a Super Saiyan 2 (at best) fusion. It sickens me that that fight even happened for as long as it did. \\n\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super's animation has had a rocky ride, it ranges from shockingly terrible to amazing. There are many standout fight scenes in the show that make these characters move in kinetic and dynamic ways that really make the fights very entertaining to watch however they are few and far in between, most of the show is sloppily done. This show has had a terrible production run, it had no manga to follow so all the stories, character designs and other technicalities had to be made by the animation team themselves which I assume amounted to many problems while making the show and I assume would result in a troubling and hectic production. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, Dragon Ball Super's only redeeming aspect is the fight scenes, they are well done and beautifully choreographed, Ultra Instinct was well done. However there's one really troubling problem here too, it's the overuse of effects, at times the auras just drown out the characters and it honestly looks like 2 balls of fire clashing rather than actual people fighting, it is really annoying since it covers actual real animation. \\n\\n\r\nSo far there's been a lot of bad things said about this show and while it has been poorly handled it is not without good moments, I actually think that the filler in this show is really entertaining and dramatic and should not be missed because it gives insight into each character's personality and is overall really fun and light-hearted, it had heartwarming moments too. Character interactions are funny and really well handled with a good sense of humor and ridiculous plot lines. It somehow feels good to see the lives of the people who were once part of the main cast, be it Gohan's acting career and cheating scandal, or the baseball match between U6 and U7, it's all fun to watch and weirdly heartwarming. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly enjoyed Dragon Ball Super at its best, but there is no denying that this is a flawed show that relies more on hype transformations rather than focusing on fleshing out characters, it's really a pity because the Dragon Ball franchise is something I've loved and cherished for a very long time and resulted in some of my best childhood memories, when Goku first went Super Saiyan I was ecstatic, when Goku fought Majin Vegeta I was shocked and saddened, when Gohan went Super Saiyan 2 I was severely moved by how he let go of his emotions and hesitations to be able to protect his friends, these moments were severely lacking in Super, any semblance of character driven narratives or transformations were entirely non-existent and it's a pity because Super could have easily built on Z's foundation, build on its characters, introduce new and intriguing ones but unfortunately all it learnt was that transformations generate hype and result in selling more merchandise and it has kind of butchered the franchise in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nI know that there are diehard fans of this show who don't mind shallow and mindless fights that need no context but that's not what Dragon Ball was to me and it surely shouldn't have been what Super focused on, it could have learnt and become better and surpassed it, Dragon Ball Z defined shounen, it inspired legendary shows like One Piece and Boku No Hero Academia that built on its formula and pushed shounen forward as a genre but unfortunately Super is severely misguided as to what makes Dragon Ball Z such a generation and genre defining series and has succumbed to using insulting plot devices that make for shallow characters and generic stories. \\n\\n\r\nI will never give up on Dragon Ball as a franchise, it's something that I hold close to my heart, I am saddened by how Super has tarnished the franchise but it'd take more than that to destroy Dragon Ball. Here's hoping to a great movie and to an all but confirmed eventual series.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I remember when I was like 10 and I dreamed fighting bad guys alongside Goku, becoming a powerful super saiyan and marry Bulma. This is what Super is, a Dragon Ball fan fiction written by people who think they understand DB perfectly but have no idea what the series is really about, exept marrying Bulma, that was my thing.\r\nI remember when everybody was hyped for the Dragon Ball Room team leading the writing of the series, but as it's finally over I think I appreciate the Black Goku arc more and more by contrast. The tournament of power arc is probably the best antithesys ofDragon Ball Z as a whole, where every single trope that Z established is done as worst as it could.\\n\r\nUltra Instinct is literally a \"I win anyway\" wih no explanation or build up to it whatsover, and if you think that's how power-ups work in DB you're a fucking retard, both the super saiyan and super saiyan 2 were built up for the entirety of their respective arcs and the super saiyan 3 and the fusion were not used only for ending the Buu arc so stop saying that please. Oh yeah, and Vegeta also gets an unexplained power up, except it's totally useless and raises more questions than it should.\\n\r\nThe villains of this arc are total garbage. Let me teach you how to find out who is the villain of any episode is: if he/she laughs maniacally it's the villain, good job Dragon Ball Room, I can see why you guys were trusted with the most influential series in Japan history. They have zero depth and when they try to make them look interesting it's just ridicoulus.\\n\r\nJiren's backstory is probably the worst I've ever seen in long time, and for a show like Dragon Ball it's a disgrace. Take Frezeer: he doesn't have a lot of depth as a character that's for sure, but he still managed to be intimidating and fun to watch and to hate, he's a simple villain but there's a reason if everybody remembers him, unlike Jiren who doesn't say a word for 30 episode, when he finally does he sounds like the douchiest jerk there is, and then they give him a tragic backstory, how the fuck am I supposed to connect with a character like that?\\n\r\nBut Kale and Caulifla are the worst thing in this shithole of an arc. It's literally written how I thought of myself in the DB universe as a kid, they are random dudes, a super saiyan walks to them and they become super saiyan in a day, what the fuck, no really what the fuck?\\n\r\nRemember when Goku had to watch his best friend blowing up by a guy whom he couldn't defeat with his most powerful weapon? When Trunks couldn't fight alongside Gohan because he was too weak? How Gohan saw his former enemy who turned out to be a gentle and innocent man crushed to death after he made an encouragement speach for him turning his morals upside down?\\n\r\nThat's called character build up. Cabba turning into one was pretty weak by itself, but Kale and Caulifla didn't even justified it, and people like them anyways beacuse they are cute girls with a hint to be gay, that's sexist and they knew it when they wrote them like that, the fact that they are bishoujos make up for how stupid and sloppy they were written, I think it's disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason that I and many MANY people stick out for this pile of trash is because we are nostalgic fucks, we like Goku and watching Goku every week, doesn't matter how badly written he is, and I'll miss him a lot.\\n\r\nThat's pretty much everything that Super is, a bad show written by incompetent writers that only lives up to the heritage of one of the best anime and manga there was, fuck you Dragon Ball Super, see you in 7 months.",

More like...Dragon Ball Super amazing that this anime got away with such a shit script and mostly bad animation, while dumb nostalgia blinded fanboys still pretended like this was one of shounen's greatest shows.\r\nThis series has no red thread. No theming. Characters don't really learn anything. Son Goku, the main character, stays the same guy he stayed in DBZ. Same goes with every other hero of this show. The characters reset every arc so what the hell was the point of this?\r\nI'm gonna tell you. Merchandising. Lots and lots of Merchandising. There is a reason every arc in Super introduced at least2 new transformations for the heroes and villains. Like with every anime, this show wasn't made because the studio wanted to create new interesting stories and worlds. It was made to sell toys and books. That isn't a direct problem in itself but Super makes it blatantly obvious that it isn't interested at all to do anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThe first few arcs are some of the slowest and worst I've seen in any anime. There is so much fucking filler, it hurts and no one ever really gets developed. Who cared about the Pilaf gang? What was the point of bringing Trunks back if he disappeared into the basically same fucking world as he did in DBZ? I can tell you. A few people cared, but not enough to give them some shitty fucking filler episodes. Super has no good story thread. This means that our characters jump from arc to arc with no connecting tissue. \\n\\n\r\nThe Tournament of Power makes up almost one third of the anime and introduces so many bad and unnecessary character, I couldn't count them even if I tried. Everyone is bland and/or annoying. Was I supposed to root for the destruction of every universe? Seemed like it. Jiren is one of the worst villains in anime because of his blandness and ridiculously generic background story. Caulifla is the biggest Mary Sue ever conceived, since the creation of Sakura Haruno from Naruto and let's not talk any further about the other poorly written characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is so fucking bad the first three arcs, I was surprised Toei didn't cancel the fucking show because fans dropped this fucking thing. It certaintly gets better later on but side characters interrupt the well drawn action sequences so much that the pacing gets destroyed in an instant.\\n\\n\r\nThe series did it's job. It created new transformations to sell toys, videogames and books to, yes, dumb Youtube/Twitter reactionists, that hype every transformation up, like it's the second coming of christ. DBS didn't try to break new ground. It didn't want to tell an interesting story or create an amazing new world. The job to create a new amazing Dragon Ball series was done pretty poorly but this mess hyped up everyone. Flavor of the week show would describe this anime the best. \\n\\n\r\nGreat. That's what everyone wanted, right? \\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n",

            "content": "Hell-o everyone. I'm here..  Writing this review. Why you ask? Because I'm kinda tired of all that hate on dragon ball super. But then again is there ANY anime that is not being hated? So lets begin my small review.\r\n###MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS###\r\nSo i have watched 32 episodes so far. What can i say? I'm enjoying it very much so far. Maybe I'm not very picky when it comes to anime, but i don't really care as long as i enjoy it.\r\nSo first thing.. The hate.. I just love to see those people trying to write those \"smartass\" reviews after seeing 5 episodes ofanime, trying to predict how much episodes will take first two sagas. Guess what? They were wrong. What a surprise, right?\\n\r\nAbout the anime itself..\\n\r\n#Story#\\n\r\nI must admit.. The story is not as god as it could be.. But lets be honest, it never is. Well it is kinda slow going but I'm totally fine with that.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\n#Art#\\n\r\nI'm ok with the art so far. It's only natural not to expect a perfect art on a long anime. And then again it is never perfect. I must admit i don't quite like the way some characters look like but as long as i can bare it it's ok.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\n#Sound#\\n\r\nHere we go.. I never.. Like NEVER pay attention to sounds in anime. Well except voice acting. And here comes King Kai.. It's really painful for me to listen to his voice.. I mean.. It sounds like its really hard to speak for him.. But.. It is fine.\\n\r\nI really like opening though. First time i listened to it i was like \"Wrf is all of this??!!1\" second time was like \"I still don't like it. Hmph!\"(slightly tsundere) and after third time.. \"I love it goddamnit!!\"\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\n#Character#\\n\r\nEverything here seems fine.. Well.. Vegeta seem a lot less obsessed with becoming stronger than Goku. Maybe Vegeta is acting more like pussy in Dragon Ball Super. But it seems like he finally knows whats happening. The pride of sayians wont help you. You can have as much pride as you want but if you are weak you can't do shit. Anyways that \"pride of sayian prince\" was getting annoying. So I'm kinda happy this happened.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\n#Enjoyment#\\n\r\nI'm enjoying this anime very much so far. I guess i could say they are delaying that universe 7 VS universe 6 thingy but since I'm patient that's totally fine with me. \\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\n#Overall#\\n\r\nThis is a great anime in my opinion. To be honest i finished DBZ last year(in January i think). And after finishing it i had already lost hope that there will be a new season. So i have never tried to look for a clues or something. And then one day i was in a mood to watch an ongoing anime and KAPOW!! Dragon ball super???? I must say i was kinda disappointed that it's story goes right after Majin Buu saga.. Then the first two sagas... But then i realized that the plot will be totally different from Dragon BHall GT. i can't wait to see more new episodes. This anime is worth watching, that's for sure!",

            "content": "Might have light spoilers regarding content of the show in very general terms so read at your own choice.\r\nI grew up reading and watching Toriyama. I can tell you Dragon Ball Super isn't really close to the best Dragon Ball content, but it's not really the absolute worst the series has ever been either. Since there are so many episodes this review will be more of a mix of all the things I liked, and disliked, that I can remember about it. Of course there are over 120 episodes to pull things from so a lot of things I might forget or not mention, butmy point is this is a collection of some of the best and the worst about this show.\\n\\n\r\nTHE GOOD:\\n\r\n- This show is filled with the good kind of fanservice. When I saw fanservice people usually imagine stuff like ero scenes, but in this case what I mean is it's full of moments to give old Dragon Ball and DBZ fans things to be hype about, such as: new villains, bringing back old villains, new transformations for heroes and villains, cool new arcs and stories, tournament arc, things that explore the world of Dragon Ball, such as going new places, etc. It honestly feels like a work geared towards pleasing the fans and giving them things to be happy and excited about. If you've been a fan from day one it's hard not to grin or enjoy some of the best DB Super has to offer.\\n\r\n- Comedy, tragedy, action... Dragon Ball has ALWAYS been about mixing all of those elements and creating an experience that isn't too dark, or too light, that isn't too fun, but not too serious. In that sense I think Dragon Ball Super delivers a lot of the same types of experiences and feels like a proper sequel to DBZ on that end.\\n\r\n- Animation and action scenes are sometimes really good.\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD:\\n\r\n- I mentioned above that animation and action scenes are sometimes really good. I remember the first Ultra instinct episode reveal and how hype and well animated that was. That being said, this didn't stick thorough the entire series. The animation was awful in the beginning, then towards the evil Goku saga it sort of became 'just ok' with just a few good episodes.\\n\r\n- Some of it reads like fanfiction. I don't know why, it just does. Some stuff about it feels to crazy or silly to be a canon continuation of Dragon Ball Z. I think some of the issues to follow explain why:\\n\r\n- Too many transformations. In DBZ we had Super Sayian , and then 2 and 3. This show was much shorter, yet had way more transformations, and they all look like the kind of stuff teenagers would come up with when posting art in deviantart. You have nothing but color variations... like they decided the normal Super Sayian design was what they wanted, and went for the laziest approach to give us new transformations: basically just change hair color over and over again until dragon ball characters look like a rainbow. Bad move in my opinion. I miss interesting transformations such as SS3 where Goku had no eyebrows (lol). Dragon Ball used to be more interesting. These are aliens for Gosh sake, give us cool alien stuff. Bring the tail back, make them look like monkeys sort of like SS4, I don't know, do something original, don't just paint their hair in some new color.\\n\r\n- Gohan. Basically a lot of DB Super felt like a slap in the face for Gohan fans. He gets his moment to sort of shine in the end of the last arc after being mostly useless until then, but I think that came way too late and didn't really have the impact it should have. We really needed more of Gohan, and Videl, and even more Satan, Pan and all that side of their family which in my opinion is way more interesting than watching Vegeta and Goku training with Whis. Also weird how they changed Videl's personality. I remember she was a bit tsundere and somewhat of a tomboy, did she really change all that much just from getting married? I miss teenager Videl maybe, but my point is current Videl is kinda boring and a less compelling character.\\n\r\n- Sometimes it felt like they had too many toys and didn't know which one to play with next. Stuff like for example bringing a popular character back, then tossing said character aside and not even allowing him to defeat an enemy he was specifically brought back for.\\n\r\n- Power levels all over the place. Almost all fights have dumb sudden rises of ki (power). It is really inconsistent who is stronger/weaker than whom. I honestly noticed I enjoyed Super more the more I turned off my brain and stopped worrying about power levels because if it was already quite a bit inconsistent in the end of DBZ it got ten times worse with Super. With the way things currently are I wouldn't be surprised if Yancha trains for a month and becomes stronger than Goku. Character powers and combat abilities became less and less logical.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - CONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super is an interesting sequel to Dragon Ball Z and will please old time fans of the series. That being said, I don't really recommend it as a 'great anime' overall. Power levels and characterizations are inconsistent, plots go all over the place and end without a lot of resolution, jokes sometimes fall flat, drama is forced and boring, and a lot of stuff gets handwaved by bad writing so we can get to the action scenes. The action scenes overall aren't great either save some very cool exceptions. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, give us more Gohan you cowards!\\n",

            "content": "I'll try making this brief since there are plenty of MAL Dragon Ball Super reviews to comb through.\r\nDragon Ball Super is not DBZ, nor will it ever be. It can't in some aspects ever really bring back the charm that Dragon Ball Z or the original Dragon Ball had and it was never meant to. But is it still worth a watch? Yes, aside from the movie arcs (which are horrible in every conceivable way). You'll have a good time with Super because at its heart it's the same as DBZ but with higher stakes, higher levels of power and a whole new set ofvillains and challenges for our heroes to overcome. There are good moments, bad moments and moments where you'll be cheering or crying depending on your preference - because that's how good DBS is. It'll never be the original DBZ but it brings its own charm and passion to the franchise and truly makes itself at home as long as you're willing to embrace it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd no, the animation is not bad - That's only the movie arcs, the rest are fine (even extremely good in some cases). Again, skip the movie arcs - it'll save you a lot of pain.",

This show has some of the worst pacing, writing, and character development I have ever seen in a high budget production. Dragonball is a series known for hard-hitting villains who are the baddest of the bad and evilest of the evil, but the Villans in super are bland as hell. Not only do the villains not hit home at all but they are introduced in the worst way possible. the final fights have no build up and power struggles don't happen. It's alwaysa bad one-sided fight until some MC powers up beyond and whoops ass (And not in a cool way). I hate-watched Dragonball super and boy did I regret it. This is fan service done very wrong. Let's hope the Broly movie is better than this garbage show.",

I thought it would be more better than DB:GT, but this series failed to make me think like that. The anime's about the old Z fighters, Goku and rest of the team you probably know. The anime's art style has gone down (as compared to DBZ)  and looks like as it was made in hurry.

            "content": "DRAGON BALL Z is a show that even non-anime watchers will remember fondly from their childhood. The signature screams during the hour-long \u2018power up\u2019 sequences, the bright energy blasts, and the dedication to the finer points of whoop-ass make the show a classic, and a damn good one at that. However, those memories are very quickly becoming boons I only attribute to the older series, DRAGON BALL. When that particular anime arc ended in 1996, there was tremendous viewership capital left over. Like most popular franchises, this meant an inevitable sequel, several movies, sporadic reboots, and a (godawful) live-action adaptation. I\u2019ll mostly be talking aboutthe state of the anime following the conclusion of DRAGON BALL Z and working through the reasons why it has become an abject slap in the face to longtime fans.\\n\r\nPlot spoilers ahead for DRAGON BALL Z and DRAGON BALL SUPER\\n\\n\r\nDRAGON BALL SUPER  enjoyed moderate success by essentially riding the coattails of the Battle of Gods film. That movie experienced excellent international success and grossed $50,353,002  worldwide and introduced a new transformation for the franchise\u2019s main character, Son Goku. His new Super Saiyan God form granted him the power to fight on equal footing with heavenly opponents. DRAGON BALL SUPER coasted along this movie\u2019s popularity. Before I get into details, I want to emphasize that I don\u2019t think the DRAGON BALL franchise should end. But, if a series is aiming for longevity and fan retention, there are some basic areas that need to remain consistent for future arcs to work.\\n\r\nPoor Animation Quality\\n\\n\r\nModern standards of animation quality are decently high now, but DRAGON BALL Z already proved that high standards were always reachable. The movies preceding SUPER had incredible quality, so it\u2019s quite strange for the beginning of the series (which was essentially just Battle of Gods broken into episode-long chunks) was such a huge drop in quality. I can forgive poor drawing for non-important scenes, but if Super Saiyan 3 Goku is fighting a literal God of Destruction, half the frames shouldn\u2019t be this:\\n\r\nThe bigger issue with this is that half of DRAGON BALL is the visual experience. A fight isn\u2019t good if it doesn\u2019t look good, and that makes it pretty hard to be on board with the series as a whole. On top of that, there\u2019s plenty of sakuga within the show too. Sakuga essentially describes a moment where animation quality radically increases to emphasize a few moments of an episode. Movements turn fluid, expressions sharpen, and shading grows detailed. Because the moments of sakuga are so incredible, there\u2019s a huge gap between standard quality and amazing quality. For comparison, check out a brilliant sequence from a few months ago:\\n\\n\r\nGranted, single episodes of anime can cost upwards of $100,000, so it\u2019s understandable that not every scene will be crisp. But I would much rather see fewer sakuga moments if it meant a general increase in animation quality for the entire show.\\n\r\nCareless Inconsistency\\n\\n\r\nNext up is a portion of the show that\u2019s more annoying than it is terrible. Inconsistencies aren\u2019t new to DRAGON BALL, but they\u2019re usually minor or cosmetic. Older inconsistencies were things like a shirt changing color, or minor conflicts in dialogue. SUPER\u2019s inconsistencies break basic, long established facts.\\n\\n\r\nTrunks Brief, Bulma and Vegeta\u2019s son from the future, has always had purple hair in the anime, despite his mother\u2019s hair being blue and his father\u2019s hair being black. This traces back to an error decades ago when Bulma\u2019s purple hair was mistakenly colored blue for the anime. In an attempt to rectify that earlier mistake, series author Akira Toriyama had Trunks drawn with blue hair in DRAGON BALL SUPER. One little problem\u2014the younger version of himself still has purple hair, and the two are in several scenes together.\\n\r\nBack in DRAGON BALL Z, Goku and Vegeta used the potara fusion to become an incredibly powerful single entity. The two each donned an earring given to them by gods and became one. Vegito, the result, was a permanent transformation that could not be normally reversed. This detail was important to distinguish potara from other forms of fusion. However, SUPER creates a 15-minute time limit that pacifies the most powerful transformation in the series. Suddenly, a technique that traded your identity for incredible power is meaningless. Not only does this confuse fans who are aware of the technique, it disposes an official DRAGON BALL Z rule just for fanservice and to showcase a good fight. DRAGON BALL SUPER does things like this and takes away the meaningful qualities of the previous series to lazily create better fights.\\n\r\nLazy Character Creation\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the arc with Trunks, the Tournament of Power saga began, introducing a few new Saiyans from a different universe. One, in particular, draws from a movie released outside of the series. Kale, also referred to as the \u2018female Broly\u2019 due to her similarity to the main villain of the DRAGON BALL Z movie Broly \u2013 the Legendary Super Saiyan, is a dangerous crossover. While I was as excited as anyone else to finally see female Super Saiyans (and strong ones at that) grace the stage of the Tournament of Power, I was annoyed at how lazy the rebranding was.\\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with how anime usually flows, there is the canon story, including the plot of the manga, and non-canon story, including filler episodes and movies. Broly had three movies but was not canon in the slightest. So for a character to essentially be him with lipstick poses three big problems for the series.\\n\r\nFor one, it means that one of the first female Saiyans is just a copy paste of someone else. There was some obvious effort to parallel another Saiyan from Kale\u2019s universe, Cabba, with Vegeta. The other female Saiyan, Caulifla, also shares some similarities with Goku. Seeing as Goku and Vegeta are literally the only two living full-blooded Saiyans left in existence, there\u2019s nobody else to parallel, and Kale should have been her own character.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, this breaks precedent with all of DRAGON BALL Z. If movie characters start encroaching on the main story line, it makes it difficult to keep track of what\u2019s canon. Finally, it\u2019s just plain lazy. DRAGON BALL SUPER  has fantastic fights, but what really makes the show worth watching is the meaningful fights that lead to character development. Slapping an old character on to a new one invalidates all of that. Fights and characters really need to make sense in the context of the story.\\n\r\nZero Power Scaling\\n\\n\r\nThe context of the characters is, by far, the most irredeemable factor of DRAGON BALL SUPER\u2019s downfall. Power scaling is essentially the dynamic and relative strength of each character. Generally, in an action-focused anime, main characters continuously get stronger, so villains have to as well. So as not to upset that balance, side characters will get stronger, but never stronger than a protagonist, and certainly never stronger than the main villain. This is the reason why someone like Piccolo, someone who has been around since Goku\u2019s teenage years, consistently gets strong, but not too strong. Lesser involved side characters, like Yamcha, are still predictably weak even against the weakest enemies.\\n\r\nHere\u2019s the problem with DRAGON BALL SUPER. Goku and Vegeta obtained a powerful transformation called Super Saiyan Blue. This form combines the power of a god with the body of a Saiyan. It\u2019s way too powerful. It takes Goku and Vegeta into a league far beyond every other character in DRAGON BALL history because all they did in the series for years was train with a god while everyone led normal lives. So when DRAGON BALL SUPER attempts to bring back old characters like Android 17 and 18, they have no choice but to retroactively create some reason why these normally weak characters can suddenly keep up with Goku and Vegeta.\\n\\n\r\nRemember that whenever the main characters of an anime get strong, their enemies have to as well. Logically, this means the best enemies of the latest SUPER arc are at or near Goku\u2019s power level. But the entire anime can\u2019t be 100% Goku and Vegeta fights, so how is this problem rectified?\\n\r\nWeak Plot Design\\n\\n\r\nThe answer is pretty blunt. It can\u2019t be. Given the current tournament structure ( a free-for-all) and plot, there is no way to include multiple characters without making Goku seem uncharacteristically weak compared to them. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the characters are flawed, it just means the plot should have been something else. Hundreds of anime have found ways to deal with power scaling and accepted alternatives that aren\u2019t avoidable. Eventually, the main character gets so powerful that only they can face a certain enemy, and that\u2019s fine. It just means that weaker characters need to fight weaker enemies.\\n\\n\r\nDRAGON BALL SUPER could have structured the Tournament of Power like a classic bracket, where stronger universes fought weaker ones in the first rounds, moving up until only one is left standing. When you have dozens of new enemies, most need to be strong. If you\u2019re only fighting one other universe each time, there are fewer outrageously strong people to worry about. Goku and Vegeta can take the stronger ones, while other characters take on who they can handle.\\n\r\nWriters could\u2019ve used something as simple as a time skip to account for increases in power. Give the Z fighters a year to prepare for this tournament. The earth literally has a room in this series where you can get a year of training done in a day. Instead of making Krillin way stronger than he should be, pop him in that room for a bit and find some way to keep him there for several days.\\n\\n\r\nAs things are now, the plot is trying to be extreme in a way that just isn\u2019t possible. An 80 warrior free-for-all simply isn\u2019t compatible with the kinds of characters DRAGON BALL SUPER has to work with.\\n\r\nLack of Meaningful Combat\\n\\n\r\nWhat this all boils down to is more or less a subversion of the basic things that make DRAGON BALL as great a franchise as it is. The most incredible fights are when characters radically surpass their limits for a reason beyond just plot. In DRAGON BALL Z, Gohan had to abandon his docile nature to defeat Cell, learning that it\u2019s okay to release his anger to protect those he loves. Goku had to sacrifice himself twice to guarantee the safety of the earth. Even Vegeta had to abandon his pride during his final act against Majin Buu, embracing his son for only a second time and detonating himself with his own life force. Every character always has a trait that needs to be tossed aside before they\u2019re able to become truly powerful.\\n\r\nWith DRAGON BALL SUPER, I found myself struggling to justify every little inconsistency. I would hear an explanation within an episode, then see that very explanation invalidated seconds later. Goku would act strategic one moment, then waste time sparring with someone a second later. Because of this, everything seems pointless, especially since this arc doesn\u2019t leave any room for varying options. There are only two outcomes, win and everyone lives or lose and everyone dies. Nobody can sacrifice themselves for someone else because nobody is in danger until everyone loses. It robs the fights of any complexity and reduces the story to a slug fest where characters look nice but aren\u2019t doing much.\\n\r\nHope For DRAGON BALL\u2019S Comeback\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s super important that future arcs are different from what we\u2019ve seen. I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing creative ways to interact with these new characters. The odds that at the end of this tournament every losing universe will actually get destroyed are low. After all, who else would there be to fight? Maybe, later on, we\u2019ll have some drama with other worlds. What\u2019s stopping Vegeta from finally realizing his identity as a Saiyan prince, and reigning in Universe 6? Who\u2019s to say there aren\u2019t some Rogue angels out there needing to be stopped? Or that having two copies of Zeno, king of everything, won\u2019t cause problems? There\u2019s a lot to work with, and I do think that with some more careful focus on story, things can improve.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever stop watching. I have too much respect for the old series to completely give up on it. But even fan favorites deserve criticism. Honestly, if the DRAGON BALL fan base decides to stop making excuses for sloppy mistakes, maybe things will go back to the original quality. The roots are all there, and Akira Toriyama has spun gold from crumbs before. As of now, he\u2019s mostly acting in an advisory role, and could possibly take control and make some improvements. Here\u2019s hoping the coming weeks will bring that spark I remember from my childhood.",

            "content": "Okay so i know alot of people were quite disappointed going into the anime for numerous reasons ( animation, rehashing of the moving plots, and a very slow start) but ive got to say if you haven't caught up on this series yet you definitely should. \r\nAfter watching the last few episodes in the universe tournament, I've gotta say that the show brings you back to the roots of what dragon ball truly was. Yes, there a lot to be said about the whole SSB thing but honestly watching this series makes me feel like a kid again and there's so much things about itthat make you wanna watch the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nThere is good character development ( for the most part so far), still those good comedic moments, and the pacing (OMFG THE PACING) is very well done. you never really feel like its taking forever to get where they need to go in the story. \\n\r\nThere's a lot of things you get out of the show that the audience wanted. as well as alot that you weren't expecting and it is great to see how the show has progressed in such a way that it makes you proud to watch it. And the animation has improved over the last 39 episodes so hopefully it keep moving that way. \\n\r\nI have to say this show is underrated at the moment and i know its hard for people since most of them are waiting for the dub to be released so they can hear Sean Schemmel be the Goku we want. There's a lot of story to be had with this series so don't count it out just because you think that its not going to be as good as the original series.  overall the show is amazing so far and i highly recommend you all check it out. \\n\\n\r\nBECAUSE WHO DOESN'T LOVE DRAGONBALL!\\n\r\nHappy watching everyone! Thanks for taking the time to read my review!",

The characters are dumb, all of them. Even at times where you would think that the characters would take it seriously, they don't.\r\nThere are no stakes, like... never, all of the plots or arcs are extremely predictable and the characters don't grow in any way, shape or form. Though if we are talking about power-ups God they have a lot of those. The series way ofsaying that a character grew is by Power-Ups, that they get by doing ... a lot of training? Losing a fight? NOPE, they get them because PLOT NEEDS FIGHT TO ENTERTAIN AUDIENCE. \\n\\n\r\nTalking about fights, the overall animation is MEDIOCRE. Yes, they improved just a bit in the newest episodes but it is still godawful compared to the much superior animation from DB and DBZ (even DBGT). They overuse still images and reuse the same scene more than twice in one episode. For some reason, the director had the brilliant idea of using Long Shots, leading to disfigured and disproportional drawings. There is also they ugly filter used in the last arc that made things even worse. \\n\\n\r\nDB Super is for the fans who just want to see Goku, Vegeta, and Freeza on screen once again. If you are looking for an actual plot with developing characters, moments of seriousness, stakes and an actual development of a narrative then DB Super is not for you. One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, and DBZ are all far better shows that deserve their fame, Super is just another cash grab just like GT.",

            "content": "Following is my personal opinion and i'll be blunt about the truth....... So if you don't like it then just ignore reading....\r\nWhen this anime came out first in 2015 i was hoping the writers/team would at least try to write a better story than GT. My very reason to watch this anime in the first place but at the middle of the series it became like any other cliche anime ever written\r\nThe series focused too much on dying our heroes' hair rather than on content, while goku and vegeta achieved new levels of super saiyan and fans were going all crazy i was feeling cringeand disappointed, achieving new level has become a necessary element because of the villains are stronger than ever but if you keep creating new forms every time you encounter a new villain then audience start losing interest. It is worth taking in account that every time you give your heroes a new form, it laughs in the face of the previous form.... let's admit that it makes the previous form useless. I would have enjoyed more if writers had focused on improving previous/current forms rather than giving away new forms. And what is that???? God mode? I'm already not a fan of this \"Make-Earthlings-Gods\" cliche in anime but why are Goku and Vegeta are only two who could achieve it? so much character centered, If you overpower your favorite heroes then your teammates become completely useless, hell you don't need them at all. The story would have been balanced if a character from the past had been given an improvement , characters such as ultimate Gohan or Trunks from the future but it seemed like dragon ball super was written to make goku a god!!! The last episode of this series was utterly disappointing... Goku and his teammates were beaten to an almost death but Jiren alone, they couldn't match Jiren in their most powerful forms but all of a sudden Goku and Friza manages to level with him in their normal forms? What sense does that make? I'm not taking about the last episode only but the entire series as one subject.\\n\\n\r\nYou gave so much to Goku and Vegeta's fans but you failed to deliver even smallest to other characters' fans, hell you disappointed them on a very deep level. \\n\\n\r\nAnd don't rub that \"Gohan-never-wanted-to-fight\" ship in my face, you just needed to give him a reason to fight, push him belief system to a next level just like you did in the Cell saga and Buu Saga, I understand that Goku and vegeta are the pure saiyans but you instead of improving Gohan's reputation one tiny bit you ruined him entirely for me and for the others. \\n\\n\r\nJiren's origin was such a cliche that you even ruined Jiren by giving him a crappy background! \\n\\n\r\nOther than new colorful hair i didn't find anything new in this series, the same overpowered goku and vegeta, the same one person centered storyline, a bunch of plot twists that makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nPlease don't come back next time with a shippy story and new forms. instead try to be creative and innovative\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Ratings : 4/10\\n\r\nProfessional Ratings : 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOtsukaresama deshita (\\-_-/)",

Some episodes were really good, and despite a few issues here and there, I did have a lot of fun watching it. The cool-factor is definitely there. That's why I gave it an \"8\" for enjoyment, but the other scores are a bit lower.\r\nA few reasons why:\r\n- The art started a bit poor on the first few episodes, but it did get better and better the longer it lasted, and there were a few beautifully animated episodes here and there. That said,it's still dragonball, so choreography is so-so. It's more about flashy fights, a thousand punches and kicks, and flying all over the battlefield, which is just what DBZ and DBS do.\\n\\n\r\nTHAT SAID, I can't help but miss the more serious art style DBZ was going for, the more gruffy look on characters, and portrayal of blood and injuries. Not really the animator's fault, just the timeslot the series was in. It's way too happy now!\\n\\n\r\n- I could say similar things about the soundtrack. It was fine, but nothing spectacular in my opinion. There's the ultra instinct meme but it's not something I'd put on repeat for my own enjoyment. It's fine, and it's happy - too happy for me! I preferred several DBZ soundtracks generally.\\n\\n\r\n- Character & story, now that's one of the bigger issues I have. Many decisions are made because it's cool and/or nostalgic, and that's definitely working. However, many of these choices I find troublesome for the consistency of the plot and character development.\\n\\n\r\nFor example: the main character, Goku, is portrayed completely different than he was in DBZ. He always was a goodfball fond of fighting, but he has his serious moments, and he was never a complete.. Idiot, by lack of a better word.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also A LOT of inconsistencies with power scaling. Characters suddenly gaining huge boosts out of nowhere just to be relevant to the plot, or suddenly learning new techniques with no foreshadowing. A lot of actions are questionable or contradictory and people gain, lose, or recover power whenever the plot needs it.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I felt the end was too rushed. The ending was fine-ish, albeit way too cliche and happy for me, but either way I would've liked a few more episodes to properly say bye to all these newly introduced characters. I feel a lot of potentially-good plotlines were left rather open.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the arcs go; I didn't care for retelling of Battle of Gods & Resurrection F even with some of the nice additions that the movies couldn't cover, and I was no fan of the purple blob (short & random & meh). I did like the first tournament, I loved the future Trunks arc (despite its mediocre ending), and the second tournament arc was okay-ish, although it lasted kinda long. Oh, and the filler episodes were actually really good!\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all I found it wasn't a great standalone anime, but as a DBZ fan I did enjoy myself so I was happy it's there. If you're not a fan then maybe not. If you are, I'd suggest to watch the movies rather than the first two arcs to save a lot of time, and maybe skip the purple goo filler. Don't think too hard and just enjoy the cool combat scenes. :D\\n\\n\r\nLooking forward to the movie!",

            "content": "After a very rough start, Dragon Ball Super ends on a pretty good note marking an amazing return of a series that was very near and dear to my heart. \r\nI have to admit I was not at all enthusiastic about the return of this series given what happened with GT but I was willing to give it a go based on the return of Dragon Ball's original creator Akira Toriyama and I have to be honest in saying I'm very pleased with its outcome.\r\nIf I had one big negative, it would have to be Super's Art design. I'm very aware of the conundrum ofStudio Toei which chooses senior artists over the ones who are far more adept at handling key animations. Because of this, Supers overall design suffers greatly and does not hold a candle to its true predecessor in Z which by far had the best animation and design of all four animes. Even with that being said, Super had some mind blowing moments in terms of choreography ultimately making it the saving grace of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Supers story was pretty boring in the beginning stages mainly choosing to follow the movies that came before it in an effort to flesh out the story, it certainly improved greatly there after. \\n\\n\r\nSuper's antagonists felt very thought out and well calculated. The Goku Black arc was a particular standout in storytelling while the new take on the tournament sagas, something to this day I always enjoy, definitely brought something fresh and interesting to the table. \\n\\n\r\nAnother standout of Super was its soundtrack.  It often hit the target on intense moments adding a great experience to the show and you can tell they spared no expense in delivering a symphonic sound wave of listening enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Super was a phenomenal return to the Dragon Ball universe making its argument for being around another 3 years. The hiatus is a good move in my opinion and I definitely cannot wait to see what they have in store for the movies and the series moving forward.",

            "content": "Overview: A lot can be said about the dragon ball franchise some people think its great while others can't give a crap anymore, where do I stand on this matter, the DB franchise is dead and GT was the nail in the coffin then what does that make super, the burning of the coffin.\r\nStory: Now not much needs to be said about the first part of super why because its a complete copy and paste of the two movies this would be alright if they did not drag the story as long as possible the movies were  only about 2 hours it could havebeen easily told in 4 episodes instead it takes more than freaking 10, why the hell would you want to watch more than 10 episodes of this when  you could just watch the movie ( in far better animation by the way ) and be done with it. When they do go and make a original story you think it might get better well long story cut short it doesn't. When the tournament begins we find that all of the opponents we were hyped for turn out to be weak ( except Hit ) majin buu does not even get to fight  and I can assure you that   piccolo fight was for fan service. Finally there was little character development the only one got it was Vegeta at the cost of making his opponent weak but since he got character development that's a OK. Finally we go to the latest arc Black Goku you don't have to care about it that much it's simply a redo of the cell arc but with a evil goku say what you  will about GT it at least made original storylines.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: If a DBZ fan tells you that human fighters were useful in DBZ well his lying don't believe him/her cause they were useless they were simply pawns to hold off the villian until Goku got  here. Nothing changed in super except now instead of being characters their the audience, no am not joking all they do is watch goku or vegeta same with gohan and piccolo. 18 and Videl might as well be trophy wives and bulma ( who cares about chi chi ). So what about goku just as under developed and overpowered as he always was. Like I said before Vegeta has gotten some character development and the cat and Whis or ok. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation ha ha ha ha it's mediocre for a high budget show and it goes down hill in ep 5 and the fights are lame which is a shame because most people only watched it for  the fights however since the people who are work on it are new a won't be to harsh besides it toei what do you except lol.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is OK nothing special but I did really like the theme song it's got energy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: In my opinion it seems that the writer and toei are still trying to write to kids and \\n\r\nnot bothering to put any effort into the story at all cause they know that the hardcore fanboys will watch it blindly and they are right, I don't know how  you can watch  this besides nostglia I really don't not know. But if you like this than that's fine it's your opinion personally I think that DB is dead and should rest in peace. I really did have high expectations for this it let me \\n\r\ndown.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. this is my first review forgive me for any mistakes.\\n",

But many of us didn't understand that DB Super is not for us Old Fans but for kids of New Generation. Everything is done as according to the age limit. \r\nAs for the Animation, they have improved from Future Trunks Arc and then they introduce new artwork which is good. Recent Animation of Ulta Instinct Goku was Awesome and Fighting scenes were great too. \r\nAs for Voice Acting, Most of them have done great jobs andBackground Music is good too.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Story, it's good but not great as DBZ as it's not so mature but again, it's for Kids so you have to compromise. It's Entertaining though but as it's short compare to DBZ where fightings tooks many episodes, you might not get those feeling like you get from Goku vs Freeza but still it's good. Ultra Instinct Goku vs Jiren is one of the best fighting in DB series.\\n\\n\r\nThough the only irritating thing is that they try to show as that Gohan is coming back but at the end nothing happens.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's entertaining and good Anime for DB Fans.

The champa arc was interesting to say the most, but it also fell short with inconsistent animation, bad character writing and partially good but nonsense concepts. Honestly the whole concept of super saiyan god is absolutely stupid, I mean 5 \"pure-hearted\" saiyans give ki and that's it? The new god transformations and pointless expositions are the new meta , and the story keeps borrowing ideas from its predecessorswith only minor original ideas of their own. Even the fans can write a much better story than this crap. Memorable characters like gohan are reduced to wimps which stay in the background, goku has turned to a retarded carefree clown (one of the main reasons I don't consider super canon, as I had huge respect for goku in z). Vegeta is almost the same, he no longer is too prideful but has extemely cringeworthy scenes but to some extent , super did him justice unlike Z. The music is bad guys , it tries so hard to build up tension with that disastrous animation, but fails miserably. And the animation, oh my god.... seriously if you super fanboys can't see it then I have nothing to say to you, since you are just blind to accept it. Bad art style, inconsistent colour saturation, constant off model characters, no more shaking grounds and epic ground breaking powerups, no more forces in punches and kicks just bland sonic waves, cringeworthy choreography(opposite of everything that made dbz great, an anime that is more than 20 years old....). Honestly even for dbz fans , they should just skip this. This series doesn't feel like dbz , just a cheap ripoff of the legendary anime that toei is tring desperately to milk every last drop of....",

            "content": "Dragon Ball Super ended after a long universal tournament\r\nAfter months in the Tournament of Power or Tournament for Survival, last weekend concluded Dragon Ball Super after 131 episodes. With that number it became the third longest series in the universe created by Akira Toriyama, displacing Dragon Ball GT. But how was the duel between Goku and Jiren? How does this series compare with what the franchise has offered us before?\r\nThe first story arc, which readapted The Battle of the Gods, received harsh criticism on my part for being a low budget version and much filler of the film of the same name. The second greatarch, dedicated to the Resurrection of Frieza, was a little more of the same. Once again it was a longer version with worse animation than we had seen in the movie.\\n\\n\r\nIn between both sagas and after them, the series featured many episodes of comedy and everyday situations to serve as a rest. It also had some shorter arcs, which really did not contribute anything and of quite questionable quality. The first saga of original content of the series was the Tournament of the Universes 6 and 7, in which they began to introduce us in the Multiverse of Dragon Ball.\\n\\n\r\nThat followed what undoubtedly is the best saga of Dragon Ball Super, the Trunks of the Future with Goku Black or Zamasu as villain (s). And finally, from episode 77 to 131, the big event with which it closed this series, the Power Tournament.\\n\\n\r\nThe preparation for the tournament\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlthough for all intents and purposes, the tournament lasted only 2 hours, we all know that nowhere like in Dragon Ball is it more real that time is relative. Despite the fact that it took us 54 episodes and more than a year to reach the conclusion, at the time of the story hardly more than a day passes from the announcement of the tournament until its conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of elapsed time, most of it goes to recruit members, which gave us interesting, emotional and frankly illogical moments at times. Among the interesting ones was the return of Gohan as a fighter and his duel with his father. Among the emotional and illogical, the clashes between Goku and Krillin or Roshi ... dominated by a girl out of nowhere. Let's be honest, no matter what skills and experience they may have, both Krillin and Ten Shin Han and Roshi had nothing to do in the strength tournament. The difference in power is too overwhelming with the rest of the team members, although it can not be denied that their presence gave color and charm to the event. It was a nice tribute and it saved us having to see five saiyajins in the Universe 7 team.\\n\\n\r\nAnd although it was also an important addition to the team, bringing Frieza was too forced. For the second time one of the most powerful characters in the universe was left out of the competition with an excuse. In a coherent world, the team would have included both Frieza and Majin Buu, Goten and Trunks, dispensing with human representation beyond the half human, half Saiyajins characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt is true that Muten Roshi gave us two of the most emotional episodes of the series during the tournament, but if we talk about the survival of the Universe, the old master would never have been a logical choice. But finally, the selection of members was carried away more by feelings than by logic and seen the result ... if we turn a blind eye to the huge problem of power levels in this series in general, it was a good decision.\\n\\n\r\nA \"predictable\" result\\n\\n\\n\r\nSince they introduced us to universe 11, using Toppo as a decoy character in his capacity as a candidate for God of Destruction, it was evident that the tournament would have an inevitable outcome. Universes 7 and 11 were the only ones with chances of winning. Therefore, neither the inclusion of two women Saiyajin, one of them a genius in combat and the other a pseudo-Broly, gave possibilities to Universe 6. The rest of the participants were extra characters that helped to animate the party and lengthened, sometimes unnecessarily, a tournament that stretched the series to the limits.\\n\\n\r\nFor a long time they remained on the platform whole universes that were totally inconsequential for the argument. Some frankly annoying, like that of the three magical girls who fought for love and whose name I do not want to remember. How the hell did they last so long?\\n\\n\r\nBut going back to Universe 11, Toppo was a decoy to then introduce us to Jiren, a character who was presented not only as the most powerful of his Universe, but also above his own God of Destruction, which, as seen in the manga, is the strongest.\\n\\n\r\nDoes it mean that Jiren is stronger than Beerus? The truth is that we hope not, because it would downplay one of the best additions to the franchise in recent years. And yet, the introduction of the Migatte no Goku'i or the \"Ultra Instinct\", already suggests that Goku himself has managed to overcome, at least transitorily, the God of the Destruction of the Universe 7.\\n\\n\r\nBut do not digress. After multiple detours and decoy fights, the conclusion of the tournament faced the three best fighters of Universe 11, Jiren, Toppo and Dyspo against the standing fighters of Universe 7, Goku, Vegeta, Freezer, A-17 and Gohan. And it was in this final stage that it really raised its technical level this series that started with a questionable quality. If we exclude the very good saga of Trunks of the Future, of course.\\n\\n\r\nFinally there was something, more creativity behind the scenes of combat. At last the animation kept a reasonably high level over several episodes and thematically we reached a satisfactory conclusion to an arc, whose result, I insist, was totally predictable. Did anyone think that the Universes would remain destroyed? Dragon Ball is infamous for being a series without permanent consequences. From the Earth Dragon Balls, which initially could only revive someone once, we have literally pass to Super Dragon Balls capable of granting any wish. Even to undo the destruction of 7 Universes and billions of living beings.\\n\\n\r\nWhat surprised us was who remained standing at the end of the battle. It could have been even more surprising, but I do not think anyone would have believed that a certain character with white and purple skin would have been capable of a kind gesture if he would have stayed with the wish.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 130 and 131\\n\\n\\n\r\nAn unthinkable duo, Freezer and Goku join forces at the end of Dragon Ball Super\\n\r\nThe conclusion of the Dragon Ball Super Power Tournament was particularly effective. Since episode 129 the series had been raising bets, delaying the return of Goku's new transformation, the Migatte no Goku'i mode. This transformation, which more than a power up is the completely instinctive use of his powers and abilities. It is the martial art that the Angels teach to the Gods of the Destruction and that these in fact have not reached to dominate.\\n\\n\r\nAfter two entrances to this incomplete trance state, Goku was finally able to enter this state dominating the defense and attack. Thanks to that, not only was he able to match the fight with Jiren, but for all practical purposes he defeated him. However, once again the series dared to subvert expectations a bit and instead of ending the fight there, with Goku as the hero, it made him suffer the side effects of exceeding his limits so many times in two hours.\\n\\n\r\nWith Vegeta and Gohan gone, Goku teamed up with a redeemed villain and a villain with no possible redemption to save his Universe. In the final episode we saw A-17 and Frieza join our protagonist in the last battle of resistance against Jiren. Parking grudges, Goku and the Emperor of Evil team to stop his rival, with the support of an A-17 that ends up being the last fighter standing, and who asks for the salvation of the eliminated Universes.\\n\\n\r\nYou have to admit, despite all its faults, Dragon Ball Super knew how to finish in a great way and even surprised a bit with this conclusion. The last two episodes were full of emotions and the ending was frankly epic. We never thought to see such a perfect collaboration between Goku and Frieza, and those minutes were pure gold.\\n\\n\r\nBut the best was the winks after the credits. Freezer returns to his throne as Emperor, Goku and Vegeta repeating combat pose and up to the stage of their first battle, with the promise of continuing to exceed their limits. Something that we will surely see in December, in the Dragon Ball Super movie that is already in production.\\n\\n\r\nBut for now we say goodbye to Dragon Ball, after almost three years of an anime that once again attracted the attention of millions of fans. This final saga has a 7.5 out of 10 and remains as the second best of the series. With respect to the franchise as a whole, Dragon Ball Super is the third best series, failing to reach the epic levels of Dragon Ball Z or the overall creativity of Dragon Ball.\\n\\n\r\nIts biggest flaw? That it did not make the most of its potential. But even so, as fans it leaves a good taste in the end.\\n",

Also we get some new characters like Beerus, Whis, Cabba, Hit, Caulifla and Kale, which are all handled great.\r\nI wishyou could say the same for characters like Goku, Goten, Trunks and Tenshian. These characters gets completely forgotten about or seems like dumber versions of themself from the belowed series Dragon ball Z. Im thinking about Goku in particular here. \\n\\n\r\nBut now that Dragon Ball Super is ending i can say that im gonna miss watching this show every Saturday night.

            "content": "It\u2019s pretty safe to say Dragon Ball Super (DBS) had escalated to become a very popular shounen anime in recent history, the creators knew the Dragon Ball franchise is still well loved everywhere, and capitulated on it by expanding it into something known as DBS. \r\nSubjectively speaking, I would prefer to straight away call DBS a kid-shounen show. While it does retain many of the shounen troupes such as infinite powering ups, power of nakama, single-minded villain, etc., astonishingly DBS also managed to throw away literally all kinds of logic out of the window, and you are left with a show that only has mindlessaction to entertain its viewers. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most impressive feat that DBS managed to do is to keep its viewers at the edge of their seats week in week out, especially during Black\u2019s arc and Tournament of Power\u2019s arc, which are easily two of the better arcs in DBS. We are given quite a number of power ups to our main protagonists, most notably Goku, where he receives several upgrades to his Super Saiyan form, ranging but not limited to, Super Saiyan God form, Super Saiyan Blue and Ultra Instinct \u2013complete-. Seeing our childhood hero Goku gaining such hefty upgrades and beating the crap out of his enemies are somehow very satisfying to watch, despite the fact that there is only a very simple story and a very simple villain going on. \\n\\n\r\nIn a sense, I can say DBS has been, to some extent, reduced to a show that caters very well to kids, as kids love to see their hero getting power ups, and beating the crap out of his enemies. I had to repeat this, because literally this is the only thing happening in DBS, over and over again. To give the show some justice, the animation, although can be terrible at times, can also be sublimely good when they has to be. It\u2019s all thanks to Toei as they knew what the viewers are after and managed their budget well. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to sound, most Toei veteran viewers would know, they wouldn\u2019t disappoint, especially at the voicing department. In the Japanese dub, Masako Nozawa once again delivered a powerful performance on voicing Goku, and this time we can hear many serious, cold and no-nonsense tones for Goku. Maybe it\u2019s because of her age (would you believe she\u2019s 80+?) and that Goku Black and Ultra Instinct may be done on purpose for her to utilize her voice in a new and less strained way. If that is so, hey, I would say Toei did a great job as those two things aforementioned are easily the best things to occur in DBS. \\n\\n\r\nOne biggest qualm I would want to point out is that DBS never actually had any sense of danger going on the entire show. Their biggest attempt was Black\u2019s arc however it received one of the stupidest solutions ever (don\u2019t use your brain). In DBZ we are constantly shivering when the likes of Frieza, Cell and Majin Buu really threatening to end everything and our heroes really struggle against them, in DBGT there\u2019s still Baby\u2019s arc which is filled with senses of danger almost throughout its entirety. In DBS, despite the World Tournament arc threatening to erase all universes, there is hardly any sense of danger because it had turned into an action fest and whatever universal erasure going on is never in the picture. \\n\\n\r\nTo wrap up this review, to watch DBS you really have to discard your brain and just let your eyes do their work. If you tried to think too hard to make logic of the plot, allow me to tell you that your efforts are futile. However, it is indeed an action delight, especially if you were a fan of Dragon Ball back then. DBS is selling extremely well and it will be back for sure, until then, stay tuned! \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10 (when considered as a kid show)\\n\r\nMy Score: 4/10 (too kiddy to my taste, great action though)",

This put an end to all my expectations. Dragon Ball never took things to that side, the character trained and became stronger and defeated his opponent, this thing of receiving infinite power from everywhereis simply shit.\\n\\n\r\nStory (1): Pathetic.

            "content": "Alright so I've been seeing very polarizing reviews on this anime, so I thought I'd chime in with my thoughts.\r\nI love the Dragon Ball series and so watching this new installment definitely created a lot of nostalgia for me. However, nostalgia aside, I do think that this is a very good series in its own right, but appreciating it will require you to have at least watched the original series and I'll explain that below.\r\nDragon Ball Super brings back what's been sorely missing from the series since GT and what made Dragon Ball such a popular show to begin with.\r\nAt the core of Dragon Ball,Akira Toriyama understands that its the characters that make the show and the adventures that they travel together. These adventures are often filled with a lot of mystery, danger, enemies, and of course life-threatening situations which lead to martial arts combat in epic proportions. However, that's not all. Most importantly, these adventures include a lot of fun, heart, and laughter. This is what the original series has always been about. And the martial arts to be seen were only felt that much more impactful because of how the series made us feel about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super brings those things right back into the series. It starts off slow, showing us the relationships between the main characters, highlighting how characters have changed over time, such as Piccolo, Gohan, and especially Vegeta.\\n\\n\r\nVegeta is the single most interesting character here because we see him make a full 180. From being the evil bad guy that cares only about himself, to actually having a family and caring for the planet Earth. And now, in this new series, we get to see his arc unfold alongside his rival Goku.\\n\\n\r\nOther important aspects are brought back to the show as well, such as the sense of adventure and granduer. Here, the universe of Dragon Ball is expanded once again, showing us mysterious new realms, new characters, new levels of power. What's great about this is that once again, we can embark on another adventure with our favorite characters.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing the new characters go off into space, Bulma included, really made the show feel like the original Dragon Ball once again. A feeling which I can definitely appreciate and commend the creator Akira Toriyama for being able to channel it anew.\\n\\n\r\nOverall as a stand alone series, this show is good, but to look at it as a stand alone is really missing the point. This show is all about the continuation of the original series, and so in comparison to that, it definitely does its job of bringing the best of the series that we know so well and spinning it with a new sense of adventure.",

            "content": "After the conclusion of Z, Dragon Ball Super had to overcome the huge hurdle, which was to entertain the viewers.\r\nOr, at least to not disappoint them. Everyone has talked about this, so I will keep it short and simple: The first two arcs were disappointing as they were simply rehashes with horrendous art and animation. \r\nUniverse 6 arc had an improvement in both, and already had the advantage by being a fresh new story with new characters. The new cast had majorly interesting characters, and the arc was exhilarating with all the battles and the character interactions/dynamic. Although I am still salty about failing buuin that exam.\\n\r\nThe final fight of that arc was orgasmic. It made me hop on the couch just like I did as a kid when watching the major battles of Dragon Ball Z. \\n\\n\r\nThe next arc is the Goku Black arc. With a darker and more desperate tone, Dragon Ball Super introduced its new arc. Stellar animation and direction went into the first episode which did a very good job at installing intrigue and interest into the viewer. We have been blessed with Future Trunks arc that was executed pretty well for the first 3/4th of the arc. The detective work regarding Black was really interesting; the constant battles between our protagonists and the enemy were a really fun watch (god bless naotoshi shida); and most importantly, the beloved Vegito, is back, mother****ers in blue! \\n\r\nThe arc gave vegeta his respect, and showed us that Goku still can rage if his buttons were pushed. Alas, the conclusion to this arc was haphazard and downright disappointing. It felt like a cop-out after such a nice arc.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, Universal Survival arc. I will sum it up in points since this has gotten too lengthy at this point. \\n\r\n- MUCH improved animation, and nicer color palette \\n\r\n- ACTION!\\n\r\n- ULTIMATE/MYSTIC GOHAN IS BACK!\\n\r\n- characters other than Goku get some development and/or get some time to shine\\n\r\n- Android 17, baby!\\n\r\n-  U L T R A I N S T I N C T \\n\\n\r\nThe show has very inconsistent animation, but the bright side is that it switches from badly inconsistent animation to inconsistent animation consisting of acceptable to very good scenes. The writing can feel arbitrary at points, as some episodes are really well-written while others feel like they were written by a hamster with an I.Q. of \u03c0 that really disappoints the viewers, and the same goes for the power-scaling. \\n\\n\r\nTaking all its pros and cons into consideration, I give DBS an 8 overall.",

It's been 18 years since the last episode of DBZ and some people didn't get the chance to watch DBZ or know all it's characters but they can now.I use to hate it when people said that DBZ has no story and is all action right off the bat but now DBS shows how the characters are developing before the big battles arrive.The starting is amazing for both old Fans and new ones.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is enjoyable but I believe Signing Bruce Faulconer as the composer can do wonders to this series. The action will probably be like 'Revival of F' and I have no problem with it cause the one thing DB excels at is it's awesome fights.

            "content": "The  first part of anime beginning well when the Battle Of Gods Story starts is a bit difficulty to wait the fight of Goku and Bills  after ritual begin . The Reaction of Vegeta when Bills Slaps Bulma is better in the anime  but the fight scene is more dynamic in Movie 14. Goku SSG Vs Bills  starts low but when begins I pray for not finish. Goku turn in a very overpowered character\r\nThe second part  is almost identical ROF  but Vados and Champa make a brief appearance,Tagoma lives,Piccolo Dies and Gotenks fight a little and Gohan  almostas killed by Freezer. The fight  of Goku and Golden Freezer have a strange and weird  choreography  but  Vegeta Vs Golden Freeza and world as destroyed  is  a way  badass  than the movie .\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Tournament  is a surprise the only  negative point is Frost is almost identical as Freezer , Vegeta  is a badass here, the fight with Hit is amazing the best fight at that point remind me Goku Vs Cell. The end of tournament and this arc give me goosebumps. The transition of this arc is a bit monotonous but  very interesting \u201cfiller\u201d plot. The Pan episode and episode 46 as a bit emotional.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mirai Trunks arc is a Very Badassery wake up of  Dragon Ball Super every  episode is full of information\u2019s, fight scenes  and tension. Give me cry, goosebumps and Hype. The best part of anime with no doubt. The Villain at this point is cold and rational  stalker and show no mercy.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and sfx is better in the  Tournament Arc and Mirai Trunks arc,and the animation too. I like more the first ending theme but I prefer J-Rock and Metal like Demon Kogure  Freezer theme in Kai or Maximum The Hormone in ROF . The slice of life moment as good,the blood make a appearance in the tournament and I miss Bra. Maron don\u2019t grew up, Trunks and Goten too but Ginga Patrol Jaco explain this.\\n",

The characters are super flanderized and seeing Goku smiling all the time disgusted me. Also the fact that Bulma became just a character who is dedicated to complaining and hitting everyone all the time gave me a lot of Cringe. Not to mention the HORRIBLE animation, which already made me dont want to spend all of my days watching this shit. Super is SUPER overrated, and it's just commercial shit. The only reason that this Anime stills being watched, is thatthey have \"Dragon Ball\" in their name, if this Show where an independent anime, a independent history, and totally new, this just would be forgotten forever like a trash shonen anime.",

This anime will deliver the quality from the past (its still the same level unfortunately, watch the battle of the gods movie in place of the first few episodes). It will also deliver the characters from the past, which in later episodes becomes a major plot twist. It begins where dbz left off, making this more of a sequel then a new anime series and if you thought that our favorite characters were overpowered before.. well... they pounded that level into the ground and are even more powerful... I highly recommend this anime, yes it does haveits cons that the original dbz had, and yes they are reusing old stories, but its a great blast from the past.",

The animation was not so good, but has improved, and I loved it enough to the story and the back of Mirai Trunks.\r\nAbout the tournament Saga of power, I found it extremely EPIC! The animation was surprised, the fights weregood, and the '' Ultra Instinct '' of Goku was amazing!\\n\r\nIf I'm going to give a note to Anime nowadays, I honestly give a note 8. Had a lot of things that could be improved, but I think this Anime deserves this note, for all the good that he did.",

The fighting scenes are amazing and character development has always been amazing in Dragon ball. The plots are also good. The only thing I've seen people complain about is the art. But for me overall I love it. The show is in outstanding and yes it will haveplot holes just like other shows but growing up watching Dragon ball and knowing all the characters is why i'm hooked on it.

The arcs are childishly simple, with no payoff and all it focuses on is giving us another excuse for a Goku fight. The show is poorly written, with no goal or end in sight, the writers and the story just move from one fight to the other. There are also next to no consequences as has been the case in Dragon ball for a while now and nothing of substance happens in theshow. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is very consistent in Super, they do repeat animation alot and have some noticeable drops in quality but overall its not something that will bother you. In fact there are some really good moments of animation, during some fights.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is not quite as good as Kais but they do use some old OSTs to help improve the atmosphere. I am personally a huge fan of the Dragon Ball soundtrack, its in my opinion the best part of the show. It really builds well and does not hold back on the epicness. I listen to each individual  OST and use them personally all the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The Characters in Super are all but empty. aside from Gohan and a few others there arent many characters that have any depth. Even Goku has become as one dimensional as you can imagine, Vegeta has more layers to him. Its unfortunate and it times it can even be irritating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This may have sounded like a negative review but it really is not, i do enjoy Super. Its not all that good but its alot of fun to watch, the fighting can get repetitive but with the addition of new and refreshing opponents the anime keeps finding new ways to make it exciting. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Id say the music and the fights are best part of this anime, everything else is not really any good. Still its a solid anime overall and if you are a dragon ball fan, id be shocked if you didnt enjoy this aswell.",

I believe this is an effort to give the manga version of Dragon Ball Super some time to stay ahead of the series.\r\nExpect more redundant details added to the anime.\r\nI do not like the art much. The movies had better animation (should be because they are movies) I have seen all 26 episodes so far. The upcoming episode 27 will be the end of \"Revival of F.\"\r\nPersonally, I do not recommend anyone watching the current Dragon Ball Super episodes. If you have seen \"Battle of Gods\" and \"Revival of F\", you shouldwait until episode 28 and beyond\\n\\n\r\nThe manga version did not cover Revival of F. It is at the next saga. I can't wait until the next chapter available.\\n",

DBS has a great mix of humor and action in it.\r\nThe animation in DBS isn't consistent you have some good times and bad times but the  animation has been getting better it hasn't been as bad as it was during the infamous  episode 5.\r\nI like Dubover sub but goku still sounds like a 80 year old women trying to sound like a man. Vegeta sounds fine and king kai voice actor is too old to put feeling in his voice.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have changed  goku and vegeta are still the same vegeta is a little bit more open and Gohan is a pussy .The humans are irrelevant who cares anyway they were weak in Z. You will love the new characters like whis,beerus and jaco the universe 6 charatcers: champa,vados, Heat/Hit, Kabe/Cabe(saiyan),Frost(frieza race),Botamo,  Magetta.\\n\\n\r\nYou will Enjoy DBS if you're not a BUTTHURT GT FANBOY or are over the age of 38.",

            "content": "You'd think after improving the dialogue and pacing of the original DBZ, we'd have an amazing show. However, it seems to be the opposite. DBS has shallow characters, a shallow plot that is all over the place, and only has merit in its ability to play towards the nostalgia of the viewers.\r\nWhat made the original DBZ so special, amidst the long dragged out battles, cheesy dialogue and somewhat awkward pacing? Each character had personality, something you could identify them with. You could see these characters grow throughout the show, whether it be Gohan from a timid child to the Earth's strongest warrior, or Vegeta froma prideful Saiyan to a caring father. \\n\\n\r\nDBS has none of this. It is solely focused on fights or developing the next season, which will just consist of either a tournament of big fight. 90% of the characters are tossed away for the sake of putting Goku or Vegeta in the spotlight, and even then Vegeta doesn't get his fair share of the glory. Every character in DBS is a caricature of their original: they are one-dimensional and plain flat. Goku is just arrogant, Vegeta is mildly irritated at everything, Gohan is a reserved guy, etc. Nothing of value, nothing unique to be seen in any character.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, DBS finds ways to not only play on the nostalgia of the viewers, but insult it as well. Their rendition of Trunks going super saiyan was miles worse than the movie which came out 20 years prior, yet it is the best example of how to view DBS: as a dry, bland show milking the DBZ name. I hope the show ends soon so that DBZ isn't insulted further, but one can only dream.",

            "content": "The true successor to the Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z legacy, Dragon Ball Super can be considered an Alternate Universe setting of Dragon Ball GT, continuing off from where the Majin Buu Saga of Z had ended.\r\nWith the threat of the evil Majin Buu finally erased for good, peace it seems has returned to Earth...at least for a small while. Until kicking off that is into another grand battle to save the planet, this time around however not against both aliens and androids...but against the gods themselves.\r\nFor every god of creation there is, there is also a god of destruction, one god gives lifeto planets and another destroys them entirely. The god of destruction known, as Beerus has appeared on Earth, searching for a legendary Super Saiyan known, as the \"Super Saiyan God\".\\n\\n\r\nSon Goku, ever seeking a worthy challenge in fighting since Vegeta, Frieza, Cell and Majin Buu all respectively now finds a challenge in Beerus, hoping to take on the god of destruction and prove he has what it takes to surpass him, Goku intends to become the Saiyan God of legend and confront Beerus on equal footing, at least...long enough before Beerus intends to destroy the planet after not receiving a single plate of pudding!\\n\\n\r\nNot long after his duel with Beerus, an old enemy returns back from the dead, seeking vengeance. The evil F himself-Frieza! after having been resurrected by the Dragon Balls, Frieza for the very 1st time in his life decides to train and upon completing his 1st ever training session has now gained a power rivaling that of even the Super Saiyan God! perhaps even more so!!\\n\\n\r\n...However, Frieza is not the only one who has received a very significant boost up in power, as Goku and Vegeta themselves have been training vigilantly, wanting to become even stronger then they were before so they can challenge Beerus to a rematch. Through training with Beerus' attendant Whis, they learn of the higher level beyond Super Saiyan God, whereas God was an incomplete transformation-both Goku and Vegeta have learned to perfect it and have gained the power that is Ki both of and on a god of destruction's level.\\n\\n\r\nThrough the perfected training, they have both become Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (Super Saiyan Blue for short) and with the new strength this transformation promisingly benefits, they confront Frieza in a rematch to settle the score once and for all with Frieza using his own transformation gained from his training-his Golden Frieza state.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, after both defeating and killing Frieza, sending him to his own personal version of Hell once again, after retelling the events of the canon Dragon Ball films-Battle of Gods and Resurrection F, its by this time that things really take a super turn!\\n\\n\r\nGoku and Vegeta learn from Whis that there is not just their universe but rather 12 universes in total, the one they all live in is known, as Universe 7, each universe has a Supreme Kai, God of Destruction and Angel overseeing the mortals that live in each and every single universe.\\n\\n\r\nEach universe from 1 to 12 are meant to mirror each other, as parallel worlds, 1 to 12, 2 to 11, 3 to 10 and so on, so forth. During this time, Beerus receives  an unexpected visit from his twin brother, the God of Destruction for the neighboring Universe 6, Champa and his own Angel attendant, Whis' older sister Vados.\\n\\n\r\nBeerus and Champa have always been at odds with one another and have always wanted to get the best upon each other, after seeing that Beerus has more or less taken on disciples in the forms of both Goku and Vegeta from Earth, Champa decides to issue a challenge towards Beerus. Because Earth no longer exists in Universe 6, Champa wants to make a deal with Beerus-if Champa defeats Beerus in a martial arts tournament representing the two Gods of Destruction then Champa will claim Universe 7's Earth, as his own but if Beerus wins then he will get claim to all of the 6 legendary mystical wishing orbs that Champa has collected...sound familiar? but of course! Champa is referring to the Dragon Balls but these aren't like the Dragon Balls that we know of on Earth, Namek and in GT.\\n\\n\r\nThese Dragon Balls are said to be \"the original\" Dragon Balls and are the size of planets themselves-they are the Super Dragon Balls! if Beerus wins then the 6 that Champa has already collected will be his, deciding to take on this challenge for the sake of it more or less, Beerus agrees to Champa's challenge and now both gods must find 5 fighters to represent them each from their own respective universes.\\n\\n\r\nI won't spoil anymore since this is where Dragon Ball Super truly begins, in all honesty, its a promising series and a true sequel to Dragon Ball Z itself. There are a few blips here and there but overall, Super is a solid product, a worthy continuation of the Dragon Ball series story line when compared to Dragon Ball GT.\\n\\n\r\nThe only major complaint i have about the series is the characterization of Goku when compared to both the original Dragon Ball and Z. Upon watching the series you'll understand exactly where i'm coming from about Goku, however, Vegeta on the other hand receives significant praise for the character developments he has shown throughout Super, truly showing him in a more heroic spotlight whilst still retaining his ever lovable anti-heroic personality.\\n\\n\r\nStory, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment and Overall are the exact same, as for Dragon Ball Z if not even more so, Character praise especially goes to Vegeta, as already mentioned and another familiar character shown later on in the series, finally for the Story praise, it continues the mold of Dragon Ball story lines whilst sometimes adding something new to the table, as well, as especially elements found in these modern times.\\n\\n\r\nThis Review is more relaxed then my last one on The Last: Naruto the Movie, i hope this Review was helpful in any way to everyone.",

DBS has all of these, but unfortunately it has suffered with many, many errors so far.\r\nThe first two arcs are essentially just stretched out retelling of the (in my view) far superior movie versions. They have both had atrocious moments of animation and art mistakes, some characters being drawn horribly off model (looking at you, Piccolo). This has been fixed to a point with the DVD releases, but I am watching it at it airs so this didn't help me. The fight animation is also pretty wooden attimes, the Golden Frieza arc being particularly bad. I would recommend just sticking to the movies instead. I will say as a positive that Beerus and Whis are two of the best things to happen to Dragon Ball in a long time- great characters. The 12 Universes also really expand the mythos well.\\n\\n\r\nThe Universe 6 arc was ok. For a low stakes tourney, it was fine and had some fights that were well choreographed, Hit vs Goku being a highlight. Not much to say except it was ok.\\n\\n\r\nThe Future Trunks/ Zamasu arc was in my opinion pretty bad. Zamasu had such potential as a villain but in the end just comes across as a generic baddie. His plan also makes no sense and his reason for hating mortals is trivial. The fights also take place in an alternate timeline that has no real stakes for us, and the plot is pretty much \"resolved\" by deus ex machina (even though nothing is really solved at all).\\n\\n\r\nThe current Universe survival arc has been slow to begin, with many boring eps about recruiting fighters. Hopefully it will liven up in the next few eps and I can continue my review.",

They have given too much attention to him since the beginning which irritates me. The other characters were treated like nothing now. They have forgotten how powerful and important roles of each characters like Vegeta and Gohan. Vegeta is treated like Piccolo in the Z series and Gohan is becoming like Krillin.

            "content": "As a long Fan of Dragon ball I've got to say This show disappoint me so hard but lets get to it \r\nStory(6): The story had 5 arcs . The first 2 arcs shouldn't even be there , You can watch the movies. In those arcs we get introduced to the new 2 characters (whis and beerus) and get new information of the universe of dragon ball and that was pretty awesome since the story could expand and potential bring dragon ball to new heights. After that we got a tournament arc that was pretty nice and was fairly good even thought I can understandif people disliked it since it wasn't as good as the other tournaments.\\n\r\nNow we have the future saga arc and oh man must I tell you what a clusterfuck of plot holes. If you pay attention even after the explanations things make 0 sense and they did it very poorly funny enough this is the arc that most people prefer.\\n\r\nThen to the final arc it had the potential to be the best DB arc ever, and then again they handle it very poorly. The whole felt like a major filler with entire episodes that should have been handled in 2 minutes. The ending was quite satisfactory but I dont even know if I liked it or I just wanted the series to actually end. It should have been around 70 episodes max each makes the story a bit boring even if it had potential made it feel dragged.\\n\\n\r\nArt(6): It was terrible at the beginning mediocre most of the series but in some episodes it was splendid, phenomenal each makes me even angrier because they could just cut the series to half of the episodes and made something really good. \\n\\n\r\nSound: It was very good could be higher if sometimes they didn't use sad music out of place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(6): Most of the characters were interesting and funny to watch , the new characters were also good. But since 95% of the screen time went for vegeta and goku we need to focus on both of this. Ill start with the good. \\n\r\nVegeta had a really nice development in his character to the point where you start to actually like him way more and felt like a real hero. Sometimes thought it felt really exaggerated and dragged each makes it not as good as it could have been.\\n\r\nGoku Oh boy what the fuck did they do with him, serious the 11 years old version of goku was smarter and reliable than this goku. They did everything wrong with him it just maked him a clown of the series and not a good one at that. Absolutely awful I know he had some stupid moments on Z but damn what the writers did to him makes me feel like they didnt watch anything from dragon ball to even work on it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(7): I gave it a 7 but in reality at some moments if was literally a 0 sometimes I just wanted to close the episode and drop dragon ball that i watch since i was 4. I kept coming back just in hope to see those badass moments each it had a few and very well done if I must say. But Overall you will rather watch the slice of life scenes then the actual story progressing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall(7): This 7 is probably because im a long fan of dragon ball and at a certain point i just drop all my expectations because in reality overall all my grades were up by to points. So this should probably be a 5. But the show had enormous potential and still has , 90% of the show was terrible like just terrible , but the other 10% was good and when i say good I mean near perfect, overall I think they should do it like MHA and just do it seasonly where the budget can actually be spent well",

            "content": "I don't mind about having a continuation of Dragon Ball, even though the show was supposed to end a good while ago. In fact, I wanted this, a sequel of what is likely the most famous anime in the world. So I got excited back in 2015 when they've announced Dragon Ball Super.\r\nBut if it is to have a sequel, then let it be better than what is being continued. Especially if twenty years have passed since the last show. That time is more than enough for the author to have thought of the most elaborate and exciting story of all times, which would justifythe \"waiting\" for this sequel to be aired.\\n\\n\r\nSuper is not a copy of DBZ, where in every saga there's a villain much more powerful than everyone else and that the protagonists need to get stronger, usually depending on a new transformation in order to defeat him. Super is worse than a copy. In 131 episodes and two and a half years of watching that, I never had that sense of danger I had in Z, the feeling that it's impossible to defeat the enemy, no matter what. In fact, those guys didn't even have the guts to kill a character this time. And not to mention they censored all the blood.\\n\\n\r\nIntead of miss watching Dragon Ball Super every sunday, I actually feel relieved since there were times I was watching it forcedly. It ended up being torture, because I always believed in the \"now it goes, this time it will be exciting for real\", which never really happened. The word 'disappointment' is a euphemism for describing this show.\\n\\n\r\nBut okay, not everything has to be so depressing. The Mirai Trunks arc (or Goku Black arc) is decent at the very least. I've found it almost as good as the Cell arc, which for me was the worst of all the arcs of DBZ. But I found it fun nevertheless, as there are some cool concepts in the story about time travel and it has a more serious atmosphere. The villain ends up being the highlight of it.\\n\\n\r\nI also liked some other concepts that Super brought up, such as the Super Shenlong, the super dragon balls themselves, the existence of a Omni-King, among others. The Dragon Ball universe itself is very interesting, and this is one of the few things the author has managed to preserve in this show.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all, is it worth watching? Talking as a DBZ fan, only the Mirai Trunks arc (episodes 47 to 76) is actually worth it, mainly because it's already dubbed in most countries. The tournament arcs are too predictable and childish, so they are dispensable. And instead of wasting time watching the first 2 arcs of the show, is much better to just go for the movies 'Battle of the Gods' and 'Resurrection of F', as they're only 1h30 long each and you will hardly find it a waste of time. At least, they should be enough to kill the boredom. From then, you can just go to the Mirai Trunk arc and after that just wait for the new DB movie that will come out in december, that I believe it'll be decent at least.",

            "content": "Let's get to the point.\r\nFor Dragon Ball, this series felt like a filler for most of the time, where two new colours were introduced: blue and gray... And this could be the end really...\r\nGoku is still Goku, Vegeta is one of the few who seems to develop as a person, we got a bunch of new overpowered people (Gods of Destruction and whatnot) as to establish a new high to where Goku and vegeta need to climb. \r\nUnfortunately the fights were very dragon ball esque for the better or the worse. Strength is relative, it doesn't really make sense at all until some character doesa comment the warrior's energy is off the charts, then you'll know A will kick B to the ground for the next minutes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, well, one does not visually distinguish strength apart from what colour is represented in our screens at any given time, so don't even try it... The fights themselves aren't any better, the details are what you would expect from a weekly show that airs every damn week for an entire year, it's not One Punch Man, meaning, there's no fancy destruction for you to gain a sense of how strong a character is, killing the vibe of Dragon ball as a shounen. \\n\\n\r\nFor the up points... There's only one, it's the OST's, that will surely please the ears of many shounen fans across the world, be them young or old. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame really, Dragon Ball could be so much more but in 2018 after watching shounens like TTGL, One Punch Man and even One Piece incredible story telling along the years, i'm afraid nostalgia isn't enough to make me like it. \\n\r\nThere's nothing here that makes DB Super unique, apart from Goku trying some new colour wigs, shame really..\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've wanted to do a review about Super for some time now but I wanted to wait a good while until I had a clear opinion on what I thought of the show.  If you look at any Dragon Ball Super forum or the youtube comments on a Super video you'll likely find that the fanbase is split between those who think that Super is a gift from God and those who think that Super is utter shit that is worse than GT.  So what do I think about it? \r\nLike most people, I was not happy when I learned that the showwould be retelling the events of the Battle of Gods and Revival of F movies.  Nevertheless, I still watched the show just to see if it would be any good.  After the first five episodes I literally dropped the series and never even bothered to look at it again until the Revival of F arc was finished.  Yes, the first two arcs are THAT bad.  However, when I decided to give Super another shot I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it was slowly but surely getting better.\\n\\n\r\nStory (Spoilers): If you have seen the Battle of Gods and Revival of F movies then you pretty much know the setup for about the first 25-30 episodes.  The retelling of the arcs are basically the same as the movies with very slight changes.  The only problem is they're told slower and have pretty bad animation.  The third arc is where things actually start to get interesting.  The arc is a tournament between two universes, Universe 7 which is Goku's universe and Universe 6.  This arc was the start of Super actually becoming a good show.  It's definitely not a great arc, the animation can be bad at times, only two fights are interesting, and the main reason behind the tournament poses no threat at all to the Z fighters, but it did do a good job of establishing the Super Dragon Balls, the 12 universes, and the Omni King who can wipe an entire universe from existence.  The Goku Black arc is held by many as the best arc in the show so far and I definitely agree.  Future Trunks travels to Goku's timeline to ask for help to defeat an enemy who is destroying Trunks's world.  What's really interesting is that the enemy looks exactly like Goku.  Without getting too into the plot, I will say that this arc was pretty good.  The story was entertaining, it arguably had the best villain in all of Dragon Ball, and a fan favorite makes a triumphant return.  The only problems I have with it are the constant jumps through time every time Goku and Vegeta are defeated, the inconsistency behind time travel logic, as well as the rushed and somewhat asspulled conclusion which in my opinion was pretty bad.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:  The animation for the first two arcs (and a little bit of the third arc) were honestly fucking terrible to look at especially at its worst.  At this point talking about the animation in Super's early days is like beating a dead horse but it truly is that horrendous.  The art also looked pretty poor with weird character models and faces.  Now I will say that once the Universe 6 and 7 Tournament got into full swing, the animation started to get better.  It wasn't anything great but I could tell that they were stepping up their game.  Once the Goku Black arc started the animation had actually become decent and at its best is fairly impressive.  Nowadays, even though there are times where the art and animation can look a little poor, its not as bad as it used to be.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The first three arcs of Super are basically the Goku and Vegeta show.  Anyone who was not a Saiyan with god energy or a god themselves was useless.  Gohan and Krillin had stopped training, Piccolo was bizarrely useless, and Goten and Trunks are rarely used.  The female characters are more or less the same with the exception of Videl who has lost any sort of personality she had and has devolved into a generic polite anime housewife.  While this bugged me GREATLY in the beginning of the show it seems that the writers are listening to the complaints of the fans and are not only giving development to the old characters but are actually making them relevant to the plot again.  Even Gohan is going to play a major role in this newest arc. Most of the characters act the same way they always have but Goku and Vegeta seem to have changed a bit.  In Vegeta's case he has definitely become calmer. Although he still has an attitude, he's no longer the proud, arrogant, ruthless prince he was in DBZ.  He actually has some comedic scenes. At first I wasn't a fan of this but now he might be my favorite character in the show.  Goku on the other hand has definitely become dumber almost as if he's a child.  Now people have stated that \"Goku was always dumb\" but at least you could tell that although he lacked common sense he was still an adult who had grown.  Super has taken Goku and has reverted his intelligence to that of a child.  He also doesn't seem to take things as seriously as he used to back in DBZ.\\n\\n\r\nSound: For the most part the music is ok and the second opening is honestly pretty awesome.  My main problem comes with the hitting sound effects.  A lot of them don't really match up with the hard punches the characters are throwing and sometimes makes the fight scenes less impactful.\\n\\n\r\nSmall Flaws:  The only other issues I have with Super are honestly pretty minor.  Firstly are the God transformations.  I don't really have a problem with the concept but I absolutely despise the designs.  I can't even call them designs since they are literally just recolors of the Super Saiyan transformation.  The god transformation (super saiyan blue as its called) also pretty much shoves the previous super saiyan forms to the side.  The writers have tried to still keep the lesser forms relevant by having Goku and Vegeta use them against weaker opponents but for the most part Super Saiyan Blue is almost always what they transform into to fight an opponent.  The only other problem I have is that the power scaling in this show is fucking ridiculous.  Goku is literally so powerful now that his base form is as strong as his SSJ3 form when he first fought with Buu.  This means that whenever he has to fight in his Super Saiyan Blue form then the fight should literally be destroying planets.  Goku and Vegeta have gotten so powerful that I find it hard to believe that the fights they have later in the show aren't destroying multiple planets. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you are someone who loves Dragon Ball and is not sure about watching Super or someone who dropped it but are thinking about getting back into it then I honestly recommend that you give it a shot (watch the Battle of Gods and Revival of F movies instead of watching the retold arcs).  The writers seem intent on learning from their early mistakes and listening to the responses of the fanbase and as of now they're not doing that bad of a job.  It's not as good as Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Z but despite the problems that I'm almost guaranteed you'll find it's becoming more enjoyable as the series continues to improve.",

            "content": "What happens when you are hailed as one of the Best Bakery in the World; use some of the best ingredients for making a cake \u2026\r\nBut instead it ends up blowing up in your own face, because you delivered something like a messy cake; complete opposite of what you expected \u2026\r\nThat appears messed up, no matter which angle you look at it from.\r\nSo, you must be wondering what could go wrong for an anime like DBS? It had some of the best staffs, voice actors, storyboard writers, animators of TOEI (a big name in the animation industry) working on it.\r\nNot to leave out the factthat it\u2019s a sequel to the most prestigious and coveted Anime of the 90s that so many grew up with.\\n\\n\r\nWell, to be honest, that\u2019s the root cause to exactly where it all begins to falter \u2026\\n\\n\r\nUnwarranted Expectation: To some extent, we fans are to somewhat take the blame for this. I mean, let\u2019s face it. Just because it\u2019s predecessor Dragon Ball was such a successful name (well, atleast to a chunk of people), you can\u2019t expect it\u2019s sequel to be just as good or even surpassing the bar set by it\u2019s predecessor.\\n\\n\r\nNot just Super, mind you \u2026 Boruto is a good recent example for it as well.\\n\\n\r\nYou just can\u2019t pull off a Clannad: After Story from it\u2019s prequel like Clannad for every other random anime. That was a masterpiece for an example.\\n\\n\r\nSo, my point is \u2026 due to this unwarranted expectations that was put on Super, and when it failed to deliver; it left a bitter taste in our mouth. Well, that was inevitable!\\n\\n\r\nNot many do bother how bad Mars of Destruction was or care much \u2026 but they do when it comes to a franchise like Dragon Ball.\\n\\n\r\nToo many cooks spoil the broth: Well there are many theories and reasoning behind why Super so faltered, and here\u2019s what I believe is one of it\u2019s original cause.\\n\\n\r\nThat line I used there is a pronounced adage. Something similar does happen with Super.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t know of it until recently I came across some facts that long running series especially one like Super has a different team of Storyboard/writers, animators, supervisors for every single episode. Yeah, that piece of info had me totally blown away.\\n\\n\r\nContrary to popular misconception, the entirety of Super ain\u2019t wrtten by Akira Toriyama. Yes, you read that right.\\n\\n\r\nToriyama himself said that, he initially prepares a draft/flowchart of the events that are to happen in Super. From then on, those drafts are handed over to various writers who prepare the scripts/story for every single episode. Toriyama doesn\u2019t write them; though he supervises them sometimes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nJust to name few, and if memory serves me right there are some 8\u201310 writers in all, in the Super cast. Now, this is not a bad thing, but my point is, this practise serves as a breeding ground for glaring plot-holes and inconsistencies that have stymied DBS.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 115 says one thing and episode 121 has some scene that completely contradicts that event in episode 115. (Just citing an example, but there are lot of such scenarios)\\n\\n\r\nI am not gonna list every plot-holes over here, sure any DBS watcher can spot them if they dig a little deep. What I mean to say is, despite having a strong team of writers, due to an unplanned co-ordination and clash of opinions, the execution is not as effective as it\u2019s supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nA single writer can do a much more effective job, in my opinion. (But hey, that\u2019s just me and it\u2019s an opinion )\\n\\n\r\nUnwanted Arcs (A Bitter Start): TOEI brings out two movie, one in 2013 - The Battle of Gods and the other in 2015 - Resurrection F.\\n\r\nAnd then TOEI plans to start an anime series based on seeing the unprecedented popularity of the fandom and seeing it\u2019s potential from it\u2019s revenues off the movie alone. Well and good \u2026 no issues there!\\n\\n\r\nBut then when the anime starts, you spent some 32 weeks in retelling the same story over and over again. Gosh, that was such a turnoff! It was totally unnecessary and rushed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then you escalate things further, by somehow dishing some poorly animated/worked episodes. The movies were atleast better \u2026\\n\\n\\n\r\nFanservice: Now, we all hear this term a lot. And as an anime watcher, it sometimes seriously puts one off from the presence of fan service in an anime.\\n\r\nBut when you hear the word \u2018fanservice\u2019, you have the image of something like this in your mind \u2026 right? (Desu?)\\n\\n\r\nSo, you must be wondering how does Super and and the term fanservice even co-relate. But boy, will you be surprised!\\n\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super is an example of fan-service at it\u2019s finest \u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnd why do I say so?\\n\\n\r\nJust look at it for yourself, TOEI knows exactly which age-range forms the chunk for DBS target audience. As an appeal to that group, they just change the colour in their pallet's and introduce various forms and transformation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell, you name it \u2026 yellow, blue, red, green, pink \u2026 they will change the colour pallet and give it, that hardly has any originality or appeal to it \u2026\\n\\n\r\nBesides fanservice, one of the main reasons they do it because it forms the basis of toys, figurines, merchandise they can sell off \u2026\\n\\n\r\nCharacters like Ribrianne and all are just montages to different anime shows like Sailor Moon and magical girl, etc \u2026\\n\\n\r\nAs much as people claim to hate GT, but they overlook some of the simplest of the facts.\\n\\n\r\nNothing is flawless, but GT was a lot original but in terms of character designs and storytelling. The idea of negative energy accumulating in the Dragon Balls due to overuse and giving rise to the Ultimate villain out of it was a really appealing idea!\\n\\n\r\nJust look at the character design of SSJ4\\n\\n\\n\r\nPeople talk about originality, right! Just look at it \u2026 it\u2019s the truest depiction of Saiyan heritage to it\u2019s core in terms of a character design!\\n\\n\\n\r\nNew Introduced Characters: Of all the plethora of characters introduced in Super throughout, in my opinion, there are only three - Hit, Goku Black & Jiren that has been significant.\\n\\n\r\nHit: Introduced in the Universal Tournament Arc between 6 and 7, Hit, hands down, is the only character in the entire show that has an original appeal.\\n\r\nThe 1000 year old assassin has left quite a mark. Everything about him is a great addition ranging from character traits to his abilities such as Time Skip, time freeze \u2026;\\n\r\nHit\u2019s a solid plus point in the entirety of Super.\\n\\n\r\nGoku Black: This character was interesting, if I may say so. Also, the fact that Goku Black Arc was in itself was the prime when DBS was it\u2019s peak.\\n\r\nSo, naturally a character like Goku Black had to have an appeal. Wasn\u2019t a great fan of merged Zamasu, but Goku Black was fine, really!\\n\\n\r\nHis ideals and thought-process was realistic from a God-tier viewpoint and thus it made for a good story.\\n\\n\r\nJiren: Okay, I will be aptly clear here and be brutally honest! Do you remember playing those games, where you had to beat opponents and go on clearing levels.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in the final stage, you have a Boss waiting for you. In order to complete the game, you had to beat the boss in the final stage. Well, Jiren was no more than one such final stage boss for you.\\n\\n\r\nContrary to Hit, Jiren was a one-dimensional plot-point introduced by the writers just for the sake of an obstacle/barrier that Goku and his co has to clear in order to complete the Tournament of Power \u2026.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, Jiren has no character depth. A ripoff of Sasuke or Batman, whichever way to take it \u2026 and that too grossly executed.\\n\\n\r\n(P.S - Jiren has surpassed Kirito and Saitama in terms of memes)\\n\\n\r\nAnd please don\u2019t get me started on Gohan, please \u2026. this thread will be unending in that case. He was and still is one my favourite characters and \u2026\u2026. well, you all saw how we was played out in Super.\\n\\n\r\nAnime over Manga: One of main reasons for Super\u2019s failure stems from the fact that the anime precedes the manga.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally, you have the manga written well ahead of manga. What happens due to which is, any inconsistency or plot-holes that rises in the story can then and there be arrested; and thus you can have a filtered version for the anime which is clean.\\n\\n\r\nWith Super, though, it\u2019s the opposite. The anime began it\u2019s airing a lot before the manga even started and thus you have the answer. Given the current scenario, the manga is performing better than the anime itself \u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe anime could have been better, had they done it that way \u2026.\\n\\n\r\nAs of 25th March, 2018, Dragon Ball Super just ended airing with it\u2019s last episode 131. They are most likely going on a hiatus and will likely pick it up somewhere in April, next year.\\n\\n\r\nNow that is it ending? Am I sad? Am I sad?\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I have mixed feelings about it. As much as I rant about it, but the truth is \u2026 over the course of two years, Super kinda grew up on me. At least I had something to look forward to every Sunday \u2026 which wouldn\u2019t be the case anymore. Add to that, the childhood nostalgia blast \u2026 :)\\n\\n\r\nBut, there\u2019s a Super movie coming up this December. And Super\u2019s going nowhere \u2026 so\\n\\n\r\n\u201cFarewell Goku! Until the day we meet again\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThank You!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Dragon ball Super is BACK BABY!!! SWINGING THEIR DRAGONBALLS ALL OVER THE SCREEN!!!!\r\nIS THIS SECOND COMING OF MONKEY KING WORTHY ENOUGH TO CHANNEL YOUR INNER CHILD, BRING OUT THE GOKU GI AND CONSTIPATING IN PUBLIC???  \r\nEhhh, 7/10... But if u want to know more about why it wasn't fan boy prasing, keep reading below or MasaGO.....\r\nStory: Dragon ball Super's story is bullet pointed by Akira Toriyama. The Dragon ball Super writing staff then fill in the blanks below the bullet points. Because there are several different writers on different episodes, the show's story becomes extremely inconsistent with the quality of each episode. The conceptsToriyama makes are very interesting, but because of many different writers interpreting his notes, one episode could be rich in character development and fighting escalations. Then the next one would be the dumbest writing u would have ever seen, you would have thought they brought in their 5 year old nephew, who just learn to read, to write the story for them. 6/10,  disappointing for something with the  dragon ball name....  Evolution in Dragonball? There's no such thing. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art the most inconsistent in the series. The series suffer from production chaos, this caused many episodes to look like absolute dog feces (Dragon ball super episode 5) OVER 9000 ejaculation, BRING OUT THE GOKU GI!! (Dragon ball super episode 109-110, 130-131). These inconsistencies alienate the viewer from the show and scenes that should unleash the hype beasts from people, don't even bring the chains because of the animation (Vegeta's transformation), however  despite the horrible and mediocre art and animations at times, the really well made scenes still slightly stand out more, 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack for the series was extremely lackluster. It especially didn't help that the first opening melody conveyed no hype at all and it took over 70 episodes to fix that. The show also constantly repeated their lackluster soundtracks which only fueled the problem. However, after 46 episodes of garbage, some person at Toei stepped up their game, and the black arc sound track is OVER 4 digits greater than what came before it, All but one of my favorite soundtracks from the show came from those small 23 episodes. The other one that is not from the black arc is pretty obvious to guess. (\"KA KA KACHI DAZE!!!, GUN GUN GUN WO MUKI!!\" )\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Mentioned before, multiple writers are on Dragon Ball Super, therefore characters could be loved in one episode, then the next, you want to slap them. Most the Z fighters and Goku is a create example of this. In each episode is acts like a different person, it becomes a Russian roulette of which Goku, the viewers will get. However, somehow despite screwing up Goku with character mood swings, out of all the consistencies the one thing that stayed consistent was Vegeta, he character development was one of the best things of the series, 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: My POWER LEVEL shot up when the series was announced, shattering scouters everywhere i went. This excitement slowly chipped away as the short coming of the shows were too prevalent to ignore and my enjoyment of the show deteriorated as the series progressed dropped to a 7/10. \\n\\n\r\nThat brings it up to an Overall a 7/10. It was cool that it came back, but would prefer if it came back at full swing, instead of half arsed. \\n\\n\r\nHopefully the dragon ball movie 2018 will rekindle the enjoyment for dragon ball \\n\\n",

Not to mention, the manga, Dragon Ball Chou, oh the lame excuse for a manga.... Initially, I was hyped that the manga was ahead of the anime introducing characters like Frost, Hit, and Botamo months ahead. Well, it fucking tanked starting from February 2016. Toyotaro decided to sit on his ass while the anime rolled onwards, leaving no reason for anyone to read the manga for brand new content :( Then, in the latest chapter of the manga released this month, Toyotaro pulledthe biggest bullshit that pushed me over the edge and stopped me from watching Dragon Ball Super. Beerus' life is fucking tied to the weak ass Supreme Kai, WTF?! This is a huge plothole as Toriyama yet again contradicted himself by stating in a previous interview that Supreme Kais that die will be replaced when a new golden fruit grows on the Shinjin tree, giving life to the new Supreme Kai. Toriyama would have to backpedal to explain to his fans how Beerus dies over and over again, magically coming back to life once a new Supreme Kai emerges. But based on Toyotaro's latest chapter, once the Supreme Kai dies, so does the Hakaishin, and it is permanent?! What the shit!! I was just starting to get hooked on the future Trunks arc, but Toyotaro pulling this kind of bullshit is gonna keep me away for good. All I will say is that during the time I watched the Champa arc, I had a lot of hype and fanboying moments. Goku's Kaioken-SSJ Blue transformation was worth all the hype!! Why the hell did Toyotaro reintroduce SSJ God \"Red\" into the Champa Arc!? I mean like what the actual fuck!!!!!! But the way Super is headed, it'll be no better than a egg in the face and a crash landing. Spare me...",

            "content": "While I was hyped for this at first, being a extreme Dragon ball fan, from the original to Z, I even have a soft spot for the infamous GT. But this?! This is just a  giant middle finger for me and all other DB fans alike. This was supposed to be the first Dragon Ball series after nearly two decades, and I was super excited! It was gonna be awesome seeing a long beloved retro anime get fused with modern animation techniques and story telling. Too bad they lacked on not only animation, but even messed up the story telling! I mean, nearly 20years and a new series comes out, so we are expected an exciting pilot episode! One that will get us hocked to the series, like how most anime do, and leaving on a cliffhanger that launches the premise of the main story, but what we got was not a launching point, but mundane collection boring events that serves not to advance th story, but to patch up plot holes from the original story. In shorts, the first episode is essentially a filler. Next, I would like to address the animation issues. Episode 1-30 is a perfect example. But while online memes and other analysers have already covered those issues, my biggest problem is that the later episodes, while improved on the art department, failed to deliver on the action department. Instead of showing epic blood pumping battles, we are given the Z treatment, where they just drag around the same 4-5 frames of two or three people rapidly punching each other, something that we had seen over two decades ago in Z. We expected improved fighting were every move is unique, and any hit that misses or hits feel significant, but watch two blurry figures maybe land a hit. These rapid punch-and-dodge scenes might as well be a loading screen to who ends up hitting who. Even the energy beams lack substance. Instead of being a stream of near liquid like energy, disintegrating mountains and buildings, passing through them as if they weren't even there, they were reduced to a one colour laser beam that explodes on contact. Another problem I would like to address is the Goku is a fucking idiot in this show. I mean, he wasn't smart in Z nor the original, but Super's version would make Kid Goku from the start of Dragon Ball look like Einstein. He is just annoyingly happy all the time as long as it's not against the antag, and even then he still goofs around. Vegeta merely talks about his pride which he use to ACTUALLY SHOW! In fact, While Vegeta had it bad in Z, always being one step behind Goku, He still had a character, one that gets developed time and time again, but now? All he does is complain about Goku being stronger and straight up ditches his family to train with weis. But all of those problems, I can overlook, in fact, I would have actually loved this show had it not made one fatal mistake: The Gods of Destruction. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, back in Dragon Ball Z, the plot was improvised, and every arc was thought up on the fly. But what they all shared is that they tie in to the main story and don't feel out of place. Raditz and the Saiyans feel like they could exist in the DB universe because of Goku's tail and his Ozaru form. Namek feels like it belongs because of Piccolo. Cell and the Androids feels like they belong because of the RR Army! And while the Buu arc wasn't my favourite, at least the main Antagonist was actually threatening and the apocalyptic atmosphere, leaving a sense of dread that's only surpassed by the Androids in Future Trunks's timeline was amazing. But there was no hint of Gods of Destruction existing, yet all of a sudden, they were behind everything, and everyone in the series knew about them, why? Plus, some of what Beerus did made no sense, like when he claimed to have caused the dinosaurs to go extinct, despite the fact that dinosaurs clearly still live in dragon ball's earth. But most importantly, especially with the introduction of the omni-king, it eliminated the fear that \"if you lose, this is the end\" because we know the main characters have allies that are way stronger. And because of that, especially with the Universe Survival Arc, every fight feels like suspenseful because we know that A, they can get revived, And B, the Antagonist won't win anyway because of The gods, angels and Zeno. So none of the arcs actually put the earth in danger and only one that did was a mere competition with no actual enemies. Besides, it just makes Zeno look like an asshole instead of an actual enemy.",

            "content": "**This review might contain spoilers but I will try to warn**\r\nDragon Ball Super is the third canon sequel of the popular Dragon Ball series. This anime has been bothering me both by its content and by the extreme reactions its getting. Either fans are considering it a masterpiece or they are really disappointed. And as I was reading a lot of reviews were either full of praises or by people who dropped the series before actual content got any development so I decided to write a detail review (till episode 73).\r\nFirst comes the question whether this series is recommended. If you have been a diehard DB series fan and loved it all these years in spite knowing its flaw then you definitely should give it a try. If you are just some one who liked the series or find it OK, well you may or may not watch, you can judge after reading this review and if you are someone alien to this series and thinking about starting from this part, don't bother because it is really not worth it. Rather you should either start from Dragon Ball (IF you like those adventurous type anime with somewhat an idiotic MC who somewhat becomes mature) or Dragon Ball Z (If you are into bad ass characters and intense fighting and not lengthy character development stuff).\\n\\n\r\nSecond from which episode should you start watching. As many of you might already be familiar that Dragon Ball Z had 2 new movies named \"Battle of Gods(BOG)\" and \"Ressuruction of F(ROF)\" and also a lot of you might also know that Dragon Ball Super that Super actually uses the content of its movie thus annoying fans by presenting them the content they have already watched. So unless you have a lot of time or you wanna note every single detail in series I would say just watch both of these movies, watch episode 1 and then start from episode 28 as movies have better animation and pacing.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10)\\n\r\nDragon Ball Super animation was stuff of memes at its release the animation of horrific,especially animation of episode 5 was so bad that it can probably give cancer . In next arc the animation became somewhat consistent but still really poor but since than it has improved and became a lot consistent by somewhat near episode 45. Though there are still noticeable flaws (in some frames) if you notice like unbalance eye level, some background characters not having eye but most of these are is scene of fast motion and some may also miss that old art style, but overall its not really that bad now (6 or 7 stuff).\\n\\n\r\nMusic (5/10)\\n\r\nThe opening is somewhat ok, mostly nostalgic. The first ending was basically nostalgic as well. The second and third were really good but ever since that all ending basically looks like those of a comical gag anime (though super had been that way sometimes). The sound track in series has just been disappointing. There hadn't even been a noticeable sound track till fourth arc in which I liked few but overall the sound track had been worst in all canon and also GT. Also I am not really a big fan of DB Japanese voices but probably dub might be able to fix some problem.\\n\\n\r\n Story (6/10)\\n\r\nAgain just like GT, Dragon Ball Super senselessly end up borrowing content from Dragon Ball.\\n\\n\r\n(Spoiler: Read next line only if you have seen BOG or relevant episodes)\\n\\n\r\nAmong one common trait, they both introduce return of Emperor Pilaf out of oblivion.\\n\\n\r\nThough unlike each other where Dragon ball GT adopted kid goku from DB, here the series takes the comical theme and which is by any means a horrible mistake. I mean seriously while in DB the theme was more comical but as the story progressed the theme becomes intense signifying growth and maturity but dropping it back to comical gag anime just was a change too big. Not to mention it is one of reasons why series hasn't been able to obtain as much intensity as its predecessors(not the major reason though).\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing Super has failed is the creativity of transformations. Even Toriyama admitted that. I am not saying they are concept wise the least creative but the execution really gives the sense. (The rest paragraph will contain some minor spoilers). The SSG is by far the most creative in terms of concept of achieving but the looks don't go with it and on top of that as soon as Goku transforms we hear someone say, you look the same. Oh this has got to be the worse way to bring down excitement seriously, in DBZ even on some new power up characters were like Holy shit what happened, though it was exaggeration but it did raised intensity. And then SSGSS, to be honest now some die hard fans will admit that series feel like they are just changing hair color and its in some words admitted by Toriyama as \"Since I used red in BOG so it had to be blue.\", seriously lacks creativity and also no proper explanation. Honestly Ascended Super Saiyan is by far the least creative transformation ever (considering u just trained in an isolated chamber for an year with changing physical condition and u receive a boost) it seemed still more creative than SSGSS which is actually the forth least creative transformation.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will just generally discuss arcs since I cant spoil contents. The first arc adapts BOG lasting till episode 13 to 14. The overall story of BOG was interesting and I really don't have much issue with it except some power level plot holes that anime generated.\\n\r\n The Second arc was pathetic. They just brought back an old villain and use that color changing strategy as lousy excuse for transformation and I don't even wanna start on all detailed plot holes(one example will be breaking of one year revive limit of dragonball). The only good thing that Z warriors actually get a chance to shine.\\n\r\nThird arc bring a battle between two universe but following Budokai Tenkaichi rule (not referring to game but tournament style (u will understand by episode 28)) thus making it like world martial art tournament so again a rip-off plot, the new character design lacked creativity. So majorly tournament wasn't really creative but it somewhat gets interesting near end. \\n\r\nThe fourth arc follows some messing in timeline and DBS after all these years finally introduce a villain with a background and reason for turning evil. The arc actually had a better track, better animation, more intensity and better fights but powers level had been inconsistent through out this arc and the end makes entire arc pointless.\\n\r\nThe next proper arc is still to start. Overall the story lack consistency but its enjoyable after second arc.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nFor old characters, I am really disappointed. Goku became comparatively immature to Z though he wasn't really mature much anyway. Vegeta is a huge let down sure in some ways he has evolved but generally I recognize Vegeta as a symbol of pride but now he is just completely ignoring it rather being more of a Tsundere. Role of rest Z warriors have been negligible.\\n\r\nOk generally talking about new characters. I already have mentioned that villain with actual reason for going evil and has reasons making him the third DB villain (after Tao and Cell) who just doesn't wanna rule, destroy something(for no creative reason) or have revenge and first villain who basically desires to achieve good but has a twisted philosophy of it. So this is a positive change.\\n\r\nThe third arc actually also introduces 2 characters with actual interesting potential.\\n\r\nNow for character that you probably know if you have watched BOG. \\n\r\nBeerus the God of Destruction. Its basically him, who is keeping the show interesting but what some fans don't realize that he is also a key cause in bringing the show down. As you all shall know he is oppressively strong and Toriyama as he said don't plan to make Goku anyway near his level. And this very fact takes the intensity of the show away. Bcz in show like DBZ, we know heroes had to go all out bcz everything used to be at stake and there was no one beside them who can handle danger. But now we know that even if Z-warriors can't defeat someone, Beerus or some stronger Deus ex machina can come for saving and this knowledge really takes out intensity of show. So basically there are few possibilities that can bring the shows intensity back (a good idea for this is being used for next arc)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\r\nMy recommendation for enjoying this show. Just enjoy the action and comedy and don't try (too hard) to find explanation for new plot holes and power scaling. I am still unable to enjoy it bcz of it.\\n\r\nIn general the series basically relies on nostalgia, comedy and action. Also u might consider this Goku and Vegeta shows in some ways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)\\n\r\nSo well the average would be 5.6 so almost 6. The show is enjoyable but honestly so far I will say its a worse follow up than GT because I have generally been disappointed be recycled plot, characters and transformation and yes the lack of intensity. GT was horrible too but compare to DBS it was intense and transformation were cooler though recycled plot and characters are there too. But I hope DBS gets better with next saga.",

            "content": "Well , some people don't like this show because of some stupid reasons lol. I have been watching Dragon Ball (the 1st one) since i was a little kid , continued with DBZ (DB-KAI also if u wanna count it) and got with the Dragon Ball Super ! The Show has awesome Characters , Design-s , best Fighting overall in Anime , etc. Dragon Ball has Comedy in it , Action , you get to see Horror-ic moments , Drama etc. \r\nWhy Some People Dont Like it? AND Why are some of those reasons Completely invalid (in my opinion obviously...)\r\n-*ANIMATION*- I Personally think this isa pretty stupid think to not like in an Anime... Well I Admit Dragon ball super's first episodes were AWFUL (till after the Revival of F arc) but if you still watch the show you can tell that the Animation got to the one of the BEST ONES !! Srsly animation now its Gorgeous !\\n\\n\r\n-*STORY*- Well as i said earlier before , Dragon Ball is based on Comedy,Action,Drama,etc. so the story its not THE BEST one out there , but its not bad either !! Some animes have a mission for the protagonist and in Dragon ball is for goku to get Stronger and Stronger but the part that makes the story Beautiful is that we get to see New and Stronger Villains every time which gets us HYPE...\\n\\n\r\nI Personally think its a good anime series and if you haven't watched it yet , i recommend it to !\\n",

            "content": "Before I start this review anybody who hasn't seen DB or DBZ this anime might not be as entertaining as DBZ since the cool down periods between fights and the character arcs built over the years play a greater role in DBS than they did in DBZ.   \r\nThis anime is the continuation of the granddaddy of all shonen. My ratting for this anime is higher than DBZ, but don't misunderstand. I still  personally love DBZ more and I believe that the fights in DBZ remain more epic than those in DBS. A side note, you should watch the BOG and ROF filmsinstead of the first 25 or so episodes of the anime. The main reason this anime gets a 9 and can possibly even drop down to an 8 is because of these first few episodes. They rehash the 2 films previously mentioned into the anime and on top of that there were certain scenes where the art was horrendous. The films are top quality and you can get more out of the films in a short amount of time. Everything past those episodes is 9-10 if you are a DB/DBZ fan and something between a 7-10 if you are a casual shonen anime fan.  \\n\\n\r\nFirst lets start with the story. The story of DBS is an improvement upon that of its predecessors. In DB Goku did have some goals like collecting the dragon balls and winning the world martial arts tournaments, but in DBZ it was mostly Goku fighting the next strongest fighter that came along (although I do think the Sayain/Freeza arcs had a good narrative). In DBS the story is mostly about Goku and Vegeta reaching the level of the Gods in terms of power. The story is driven by the mystery about all the other universes outside of the one we have know throughout this franchises history. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, other than the early episodes of the anime are top notch. Its fun to see characters from an old anime in such high quality. The art and animation is especially great when the big climactic fights are happening. Overall great art and animation expected from todays anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great, character themes always suit the action especially the super saiyan blue theme which always raises the intensity. There are alot of callback to old DBZ themes including the classic DBZ opening theme as background music.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in super are  the old characters we know and love. The great thing about super is all of the main cast get their chance to shine. One thing that was lacking in DBZ was that all our favorite characters from DB where pushed to the wayside in favor of the all powerful saiyan warrior race. Now obviously the saiyans are still more important than the rest of the cast but the spotlight is not as fixated on the saiyans especially in Gokus case. Goku shares the spotlight with Vegeta as main characters of this anime which adds a little diversity in terms of who gets more action.  All the history these characters have built over time comes into play in this anime and as a longtime fan its great to see. Theres a moment between Master Roshi and his students that tugs at the heart strings. They really take advantage of the longtime fans that have special attachments to these characters. They also introduce great new characters like Chompa, Hit, Caulifla, Goku Black,Zamasu and Cabba. All of which are very appealing for the small amount of time we get to spend with them. Also new additions to the main cast like Jacco, Beerus and Whis are intergrated very well and you will grow to like them as much as the old characters.\\n\\n\r\nObviously I enjoyed this anime very much. I believe if you consider yourself a fan of the dragon ball franchise this anime is a must watch. If you've never watched any dragon ball before I believe you should watch at least DBZ before jumping into this anime. Major improvements to this anime compare to its predecessors are the pacing (Which is shocking because Toei is the anime studio). One major issue with DBZ is the pacing which is not a problem in DBS. Where as in DBZ some major arcs could last 30+ episodes the new major arcs in this anime like the Universe 6 arc and the Goku Black arc are max 15 episodes so all the action and story comes fast. The treatment of the characters as previously mention is much better in DBS and the character development is more spread out. As a longtime fan certain things might bother you like how new characters can achieve legendary old techniques from the past series. This anime is also a great mix of DB and DBZ. It contains the comedy from DB with the cataclysmic fights from DBZ. The comedy is great, I've laughed out loud watching this anime more than any other anime I've ever seen. The fights are still amazing with most major contest being equivalent to those of DBZ. Although, I still think the action in DBZ was better so far...\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I definitely think this is a special anime for fans of the franchise and is worthy of a 9-10 rating for those fans. Obviously if you have never liked the franchise the chances of you liking this anime are very slim, unless the improved comedy sways you.",

The plot takes fans on a roller coaster ride through peaks of super-powered fights and deep valleys of annoying comedic filler. \r\nThe \"Battle of The Gods\" saga is a frustrating comedic circus of characters that in which family values and food porn replace martial arts training and quests for dragonballs. The \"God of Destruction\" instills no fear and inspires no hatred for the audience.\r\nAfter an anti-climatic ending, the next saga jumps immediately into the action,introducing new villains that quickly act out their evil deeds. Though more action-packed, the \"Resurrection of F\" story arc relies heavily on nostalgia to make up for the faults of the previous saga. The positive qualities of this saga can be found in flashbacks, returning villains, and fight sequences, though they\u2019re still plagued by comedic distractions like Jaco the space patrolman and strawberry sundaes. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike these first two sagas, there is no cinematic version for Dragonball Super\u2019s latest saga. This inter-dimensional tournament introduces new characters to provide more combat, however the new characters appear goofy and unappealing, with spaghetti arms and potbellies, while the tougher-looking opponents are simply recycled character designs. Unfortunately, there's more cheating and refereeing than fighting, and there's a complete lack of any side plots or urgency.",

            "content": "Hello Everyone, This Is My First Review and It's gonna be of the sequel of the First  I Ever Watched on TV.\r\nAND Here it is.\r\n..\r\nSTORY:-\r\nDBS Has a Great Story Indeed. And Yes, From DB-Z, the Last Episode was Skipped And the Story Continues After the Completion of Buu Arc. \r\nThe First arc was Beerus's Arc which was Really Good. Followed by Resurrection 'F', which was a Real Great Addition to DBS from DBZ, Freeza was a Character who was Feared By Many In DBZ and hadn't Dissapointed us in DBS Also.\r\n3rd was the Tournament between Beerus & Champa Which is a Must watch ofthe DBS Series. After that, a Small Superhuman Water Arc which was Fight between Goku and Superhuman Water Consumed Vegeta, it was only for about 5 Episodes but was good too. \\n\r\nAnd Next wa sthe GOKU BLACK Arc, The Story was Good and Short and the Story didnt get carried for too Long. \\n\r\nAnd Now Ongoing Tournament of POWER Arc, which has a great Storyline going on.\\n\r\nART:-\\n\r\n1st arc had Good Animations until the the resurrection of Freeza, after his Resurrection, The Animation became bad and there wasn't any consistancy in it. Every Episode, the Character's Body's looked a lil Diffrent in each scene, that went on until the End of Ressurection 'f' , but it had some Improvement's in Super Human water Arc, and In GOKU Black arc, they Killed it with the Animations, Man, it was Something after that, in the Tournament Arc, \\n\r\nThe ART was Changed, yes, the character art was more like, it had more shadow at the edges and was darker.\\n\r\nThe art's Really Good but They shouldn't had done that, i saw many comments stating that they didn't like Dbs anymore, like they used to, it wasn't because it was bad or anything, it's because of the Sudden Change in ART. Even i felt the same, they Shouldn't had changed the Animations while running the show, they should had released a Sequel with the New Animations we have Now. That's what i think about the Art.\\n\r\nSOUND:-\\n\r\nSound is DB Series (not watched DB Kai) is Alway's Good, But they Need to Improve on it because the Adrenaline Rush DBZ used to Give, that just Isn't there in DBS's Music. Still. it's Good though.\\n\r\nCHARACTER:-\\n\r\nThe Main Character Here is GOKU, in Resurrection ARC, the Strength Goku, Vegeta & Freeza had was shown to Be Monstrous. You'll Know what i mean if u see it. \\n\r\nGOHAN was way strong Before, so him Catching Up to them isn't an Issue.\\n\r\nAndroid 17 has been Training for Years and since he's part Human, He's capable of Becoming Stronger and we can clearly see how developed and Strong he is Now.\\n\r\nFreeza, well, he was Already strong than SSB before, He now has More Control over the Form and Goku/Vegeta had some time inbetween to become Stronger, considering the GOKU Black Arc, They Both were Supposed to be Atleast a Little Stronger than Freeza But No Idea why they were shown to be as Strong as Freeza. (Before the Tournament Start-Freeza & Goku Go 1-on-1 on a Single Punch Brawl).\\n\r\nAndroid 18, Krillin, Piccolo, Tien & Master Roshi have Become Stronger But Not So Strong that they can Be On Par with Goku,Vegeta, Gohan, Freeza or Android 17.\\n\r\nSo, the way Characters have Developed is Really Good.\\n\r\nAnd, in the Tournament of POWER, the new Characters that Were Introduced were Related to Many other Outside Characters, Ex: U10's GOD was similar to Hindu God Ganesha, Harley & Joker's Character Played as U11's GOD & Angel & Many More. It was really Nice to see those Similarities but a bit dissapointed too coz these & Some character's weren't Unique (Ex: Naruto's Characters, Each is Unique nomatter How Many there are. Hell, Take DB & DBZ for Examples).\\n\r\nOverall, Character Developement is Good.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:- \\n\r\nWell, It Wouldn't Say I Absolutely Love DBS. But  I Do Like watching it. \\n\r\nI Already Watched DBS twice until the 100th Episode and i'm sure I Can watch it again.\\n\r\nit isn't like Watching DBZ or DB, i can watch DBZ for like 5-10 Times and watch it Again.\\n\r\nBut, It is a Really Enjoyable Show Considering the Fact that the Animations were Changed all of a Sudden in Tournament of Power instead of Improving on the Animations of the Previous Arc's.\\n\r\nOVERALL:-\\n\r\nI'd recommend you to Wach DB & DBZ (You'll Love it if u like Fighting ) And DBZ too.\\n\r\nDB GT was a Diffrent Arc. More like the Other Part of Sequel for DBZ.\\n\r\nBut Compared to DB GT, DBS is Really Good. \\n\r\ni'd reccomend you Give it a Watch.",

            "content": "Huge Spoilers up to episode 92 :) I have watched up to episode 92. I have also watched all the previous series including GT. Sorry about my English, not my 1st language. This one right here is my least favorite one until now. I don't even know where to start. Firstly, it seems most of the characters have become somewhat dumber to a level of retardedness almost. The animation is very bad and the character design is incredibly lazy and bad. I mean the guy with the giant fists is an eyesore wtf. The way the most powerful being of the universe is portrayed iswow, baffling. A dumb 5 years old child. No higher conscience, no enlightement, just a moody spoiled 5-year-old. That was a huge slap on everyone right there. The only character that somehow remained interesting is Frieza in his latest appearance. The plot, well, seems to me that it was written by 12 year old children for 12 year old children. Whoever finds this awesome didn't watch too many animes I assume or they are incredibly huge fans.  That is why I watched it until now at least. I had huge hopes for this. It had huge potential. And when I first saw the rumor of Black Goku I thought I will see a genuine Goku from another universe that was genuinely bad for some reason and some events. But no, of course let's not dissapoint the kids, goku can't be bad. Anyway the delivery, the animation, the plot everything is mediocre at best. Oh the best part, the creator is like only supervising and sometimes giving pointers, the main writer of the manga that comes with pitches to him is a fan who got this job. But actually if I think about it, maybe it would be better if this guy made it all by himself. I mean I understand that he wanted to keep the same atmosphere and stuff but he totally ignored the fact that hey, maybe all the fans grew up in these 20 something years between this series. Maybe I should make it a bit more complex, a bit darker, a bit more realistic I would dare to say, not the huge joke it came out to be.",

            "content": "So, the thing about Dragon Ball Super is that how much you like it will depend strongly on the first two arcs. As they are just recaps of the movies Battle of Gods and Resurrection F, there are basically three different options as to how the first two arcs can be experienced. If you've already seen those two movies like many people(myself included), then these first 27 episodes are not going to be enjoyable. The story is almost exactly the same, so don't expect any surprises. On top of that the animation is far, far worse than the movies, and the plot is dragged outto an annoyingly slow pace. However, if you haven't seen the movies, then this will be new content, so you'll probably be able to overlook the little annoyances. The third option is to just skip these first 27 episodes and just watch the movies instead. After episode 28, Dragon Ball Super drastically improves. The current arc (the Black Arc) is possibly one of the best in the entire franchise, making Dragon Ball Super worth watching for any fan of the original series. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, if you watch the Battle of Gods movie, episodes 15-18, Resurrection F movie, and then continue with Super after episode 27, you'll be in for a really good time.",

It starts with a more funny and story based start and I like it cause newer fans can get use to the characters. It's been 18 years since the last episode of DBZ and some people didn't get the chance to watch DBZ or know all it's characters but they can now.I use to hate it when people said that DBZ has no story and is all action right off the bat but now DBS shows how the characters are developing before the big battles arrive.The starting is amazing for both old Fans and new ones.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is enjoyable but I believe Signing Bruce Faulconer as the composer can do wonders to this series. The action will probably be like 'Revival of F' and I have no problem with it cause the one thing DB excels at is it's awesome fights. Though one thing I heavily hope for this series is to not bring villains who regenerate and to use it's human characters more.\\n\\n\r\nbut otherwise its a great series and i highly recommend to watch it!!\\n\r\nand for more dragon ball related things join my discord server: https://discord.gg/BZZFphh",

            "content": "What does happen nowadays either in movie or anime making when there are an enormous amount of technical possibilities to create something stunning, something thrilling, gorgeous, satisfying motion picture? Everything is one half-assed. \r\n Dragon Ball Super, or I would like to call it \"God of Destruction: Untold story of Goku and Vegeta with commentary from everyone else\", was greatly awaited by most of its prequel fans, looking forward to how all the modern possibilities will improve all the thrilling action that Dragon Ball is known about. Starting from character designs to action scenes it is expected from viewers to receive exciting sequel toundoubtably one of the greatest anime series that has ever been created. But does it hold up to expectations? Even though the series have only begun, I suppose that this is as good as time as any to write a short review since I do not suspect of it getting any better.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nUp until now story have been about Goku and Vegeta (partly) facing the most powerful threat they have ever come across- God of Destruction. In order to beat the new foe, Goku must obtain power called Super Sayan God. \\n\r\nThe things I like in this new plot:\\n\r\n- Enemy this time is not some kind of evil being who tries to take control of world/universe, but instead it is a god that already poses such power that surpasses everyones elses in whole universe;\\n\r\n- God of Destruction is well placed into entire Dragon Ball universe with very believable explenation;\\n\r\n- Explores new dimensions of Sayan power.\\n\\n\r\n That is it for the good things I can say about the story, now I will get to cons, but since I want to keep it short, I will only name few features I did not enjoy:\\n\r\n- Making all the other characters, except main ones, useless;\\n\r\n- Super Sayan God power makes no sense, whatsoever. If in Dragon Ball GT SS4 was well integrated into story and in its representing universe it seemed very possible and a nice way to upgrade sayan skills to the next level without making them overpowered (well, except for SS4 Gogeta). But now even the idea of someone just suddenly becoming a god seems absurd\\n\r\n-  The beginning of anime was just sterile and lifeless. Crushed my hopes for a great sequel.\\n\r\n- The way story is presented seems like I am watching a cartoon for children.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nVisuals for these episodes are fairly good but could have been much better if more time was spent on improving those. What I hated the most was the design of Goku. In the way he is designed now, I do not care how many times he will turn into super sayan god, or how powerful he gets throughout episodes, with this design he looks like a little buffed up wimp.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nOnly ones that stood out were Goku, Vegeta (though he mostly seemed more like a circus clown than an actual fighter), Beerus and a little bit Whis. All the other ones where there for few awkward jokes and for commenting and watching Goku fight since they now are totally outclassed. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nReally enjoyed opening and ending themes, but other than that soundtracks were average.\\n\\n\r\nOther comments\\n\\n\r\n- There are almost no action scenes. and those who are, they are just \"meh, it is okay\". I miss the thrill from the old series, even Dragon Ball GT. You could feel all those emotions; action and suspense makes you shiver from excitement. \\n\r\n- Old series I can watch over and over, and over again without getting tire from them, but now you just have to hope that it will get better as time passes. \\n\\n\r\n(This short review was made after watching 16 episodes and I hope that when it ends my thought will have changed for the better)",

            "content": "I have never written a review before but I want to share my thoughts on how I felt about DBS, so bare with me.\r\n*SPOILERS MAY APPEAR*\r\nStory (6/10):\r\nThe story overall wasn't bad, but it wasn't what I expected either. There were certain sagas that could have been written so much better. I was quite disappointed in the first 2 sagas because the transformations and battles just seemed so underwhelming in my opinion. The Resurrection F one really annoyed me because I felt like Freiza should have had more justice to his return, as he is one of the best villains in the Dragon Ball franchise. Itjust didn't seem exciting to me at all, and the battle between Goku and Frieza was not even close to being as good as their first on in DBZ. I also found it pointless on releasing two movies that were practically the first two sagas of the show, you might as well just skip to the third saga if you have seen the movies before the series. These two arcs really turned me off from the series for a bit, but then I decided to continue. As the story progressed, it became better. The Future Trunks arc and The Universal Survival arc were the best out of the series. I felt the tension and sense of danger from the two, and it actually kept me wanting to watch the show more. I will say though that the US arc was dragged out a bit too much, which kinda got me frustrated as the tournament was just under an hour. I also wish that the last episode was an hour long, as the last episode felt a little rush, but I did still like it so it is all good. Overall, it wasn't bad, but like I said, better writing could have made the show much better.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7.5/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good, it definitely got better as the series progressed. In terms of animation, it had its good and bad days. Overall, I didn't have a problem with it.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the soundtracks and sound effects. No complaints about that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nThis factor is the one that really annoyed me out of the whole entire show.  Let me start off with Goku. I get that Goku has never been the smartest and has been selfish at times, but it seems like Goku has become more dumb and selfish in Super. To me, it seems like Goku has lacked in family values compared to Z, as all he wants to do is train and will do anything to avoid spending time with Chi-chi, his WIFE, and Goten, his YOUNGER SON or go and visit Gohan, Videl and Pan, hell, he even wanted Vegeta to ditch the birth of his daughter just to go train. I don't entirely blame him as it's his Saiyan genes, but Vegeta is Saiyan and seems to be a better family man. Goku also seems to be brain dead at times, not that he wasn't, but Super has pursued this to another level. I'm not too mad about his character overall as he is still one of my favourites, but come on now. However, I'm referring to the Japanese version but possibly some of the dialogue will be changed in the dub. Another thing that pissed me off was how there were a lot of characters pushed to the side or underdeveloped. For example, Yamcha was practically irrelevant in the whole series. Sure, he's not the best fighter or anything, but I feel like he deserved some more respect and be more relevant. I was also disappointed that Goten was irrelevant in the whole series too. The fact he is supposed to be Goku's son, he should have had much more character development and attention, just like Gohan had in Z, it would have been nice to see a journey for him. There are more characters in which I feel the same way but I'm not gonna waffle too much. There were some good new characters I liked, such as Hit, Jiren etc, but I wish Jiren had more of a better introduction and backstory as he was one of the important characters in the final arc.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the faults I pointed out previously, I still enjoyed the series, and I'm actually gonna miss watching it every Sunday. It still had its great moments and funny humour.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7-7.5/10):\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, it was still a good show. It may not be as good as DB and DBZ, but it definitely isn't the worst to what people have said, to each its own. To me, I think it is worth a watch. Luckily the series will return in the future, so I hope they will make major improvements, especially in story and character in my opinion.\\n",

Vegeta is a far cry from the asshole he use to be I'll say that much.\r\nEnjoyment (9): The only category that ultimately matters. It is a fun show.

It's one thing to be told someone is faster and stronger, it's much better that you can convey it with your animation in a way that really feels that way.\\n\\n\r\nMain reasons I dislike the show:\\n\r\n- Power creep too high. Zeno is a thing and it makes this all feel so minuscule and worthless literally.\\n\r\n- Goku.

Swapping between semi serious action kickass and really well written character comedy, this is a master piece for me. Most enjoyable anime I've watched in 10 years. \r\nat some points (early on in the show) the battles drag on a bit longer than they should (but hey that'sdragonball). and all the subplots early on in the show aren't the most interesting but both of these things get better later on. \\n\\n\r\nWould recommend to every DBZ fan and to ppl who want to watch something that is exciting and relaxing at the same time.",

Remember kids, before you hate on this review I love this series for the most part; but I gotta be fair and objective. \r\nStarting with if you saw the last two DBZ movies (Battle of Gods & Resurrection F) then you've seen the first two arcs of DBS. Yes there are subtle differences between the two versions but notenough. Also \\n\r\n[spoiler]\\n\r\nThe future Trunks arc goes nowhere and only serves to explain why there are two Zeno's later\\n\r\n[/spoiler]. \\n\r\nThis show also has no mercy for newbies (let's be honest here, how can you call yourself otaku if you haven't seen DBZ?). Nothing is explained except for new characters powers and motivations. I understand that this is the fourth series in the franchise but a 12 year old who got a CR membership for Xmas may not have seen DBZ and might find this series unapproachable. It's a good action show with no depth, no character development and no metaphorical symbolism. For some that's good, for others that's bad. It's about guys (and gals now) punching each other, powering up, and hurling energy blasts at each other. For some that's good, others that's bad. Hence the lack of a middle ground. \\n\r\nNOTE: Originally I was gonna give this a three but the addition of female characters who fight is innovative (For a Dragon Ball series) to elevate it to a four from me.",

Poorly drawn key frames and reused animation remained a problem all the way till the universe survival arc when things started picking up. The last six episodes had the best animation in the series. There were other notable episodes in the Universe Survival Arc like 103, 110, 115, 118 and many others. But reused animation plagued even their best. Another problem was the consistentuse of Anime troupes.\\n\\n\r\nThe music I felt was awesome throughout the series. Though the very best came with the tournament of power arc with the OPs, BGMs and EDs.\\n\\n\r\nThe series kept bringing in new and interesting characters while developing our old favourites. Of the old Android 17 saw the most development going from the rebellious teen we saw Z to a responsible yet cool adult in Super. Goku, Gohan and Vegeta also had their moments. Frieza's arc came as a surprise, I had written him off after Resurrection of F arc. Among the new characters, I liked Universe 6, especially the Namekians for their determination, Universe 3 and Universe 2 also had interesting characters. There were however many underplayed characters. Tien deserved better than he got. Jiren could have been handled better, he at least ended well.\\n\\n\r\nThe series was enjoyable throughout I really look forward to the movie.",

            "content": "Here's the long and short of it: Dragon Ball Super isn't that good, and its flaws are huge. On the other hand, it's fun to watch, a testament to the fact that I've willingly stuck with it until now. But I'm going to try to generalize what I feel the show succeeds in and what if fails in -- and why the latter literally doesn't matter.\r\nFirst let's get this out of the way: this show is a continuation of Dragon Ball, but has only been animated to this point for the sake of merchandising. This may be an oversimplification of the matter, but that isn'tto say this is a bad thing. It's just the nature of the beast when it comes to an IP like Dragon Ball. Is the show bad because of this? Not really. \\n\\n\r\nMy main critique of the plot and the characters boil down to the same argument: too shallow and unchanging. There's an important notion to consider here, that being the fact that most of us watched DB and DBZ as an English dub, and many switched to the sub for the sake of watching Super. Why is this important? Consider Goku. He's just a hillbilly hick who likes to fight. His whole speech after turning super saiyan about being the defender of the so and so and what not? Dubisms, and not in any way an accurate representation of the character. That being said, Super makes a lot more sense when you can turn your brain off and take it for what it is: Goku and friends fighting a lot. The last major villain is dumb as hell story-wise, and -- not to spoil anything -- the major \"reveal\" in the penultimate episode (regarding the remaining fighters in the tournament) was also dumb as hell. This critique applies to most of the tournament of power arc, but such is the nature when you have to introduce nearly 100 new characters only to eliminate most of them from the series nearly immediately. \\n\r\nThe main characters never really get any more interesting, with a few exceptions (17 gets a lot more showtime in this arc and I love that). Krillin's boring, 18 has a forced character, Gohan is cheated out of any cool scenes, we don't get to see Vegito (a waste, honestly, but I would be more okay with it if they took even five seconds to even mention why they wouldn't fuse in a battle with everything on the line), and Vegeta (while a lot of fun) doesn't really feel the same when they go on about his pride but we don't even get any thoughtful dialogue from him. A lot of wasted potential.\\n\\n\r\nBut but but, and here's the thing: while Super isn't an adaptation of a manga, it still has to consider its source material while still keeping up with a weekly release schedule. Rather, an anime of this nature has to play it safe plot-wise, which may explain its general lack of complexity. We can also see that, while quite a few episodes suffer (some more than others) from lack of time and effort, likely for the budget's sake, there are still obvious highlights in each arc for which it seems most of the effort was saved. Tokyo Ghoul season 2 did this, and it looked pretty terrible animation-wise at some points, but I still recognize it's altogether a really good IP. I don't know if I'm going to say the same about Dragon Ball considering a lot of the shit Super has tried to pull (such as the obvious question of how the hell Vegeta managed SSB without attaining SSG but whatever) but I also think we have good reasons for letting this slide.\\n\\n\r\nWhat baffles me the most in harsh critiques of this show would the the opinions I read on the art and sound. Let's be real, these are the best parts of the series. It sounds good. It may not have the most impressive soundtracks of the DB franchise but it's absolutely fine. I've also put some thought into the yelling of the show, which has become something of a staple of Dragon Ball in general. Those voice actors are good at yelling. There's really not more to say about that, I just appreciate it. And, despite the corners they had to cut animation-wise (as mentioned before), the show looks great as well. Just because a giant red beam colliding with a giant blue one isn't particularly new or intrinsically interesting, it still looks pretty enough and, really, why else do we care? \\n\\n\r\nThinking from Funimation's perspective as a company, the lack of \"change\" we see in the characters makes sense. To get creative and new with an existing character is to risk being scrutinized for not staying true to the established character or something of that nature, although when the established character is bland as hell, that kind of effort would be appreciated (consider Krillin as an example). But, in the end, Super's just fun to watch. Especially after FighterZ's release -- which is possibly the most respectable DB fighting game on the market -- we can see that the \"culture\" of super has not been sullied when translated to the game format, supporting the notion that Super isn't inherently bad, but can be presented in a fun, appealing way.\\n\\n\r\nA complex story is not necessary for many works, and DBS as an anime is a prime example of this. Note, a better story and more developed characters/drama would have been a very welcome step towards making Dragon Ball a much more quality series toward the end of its life cycle (as of now), but this standard for Dragon Ball hasn't really changed since the Buu Saga in Z.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's more Dragon Ball, for whatever that's worth to you. \\n",

            "content": "***I apologise for my horrible grammer***\r\n**This is gonna be a longi review so yh, theres your warning lol Theres no realy catagories where i can place my thoughts as these are fresh thoughts andi I'm just writing whetever comes to mind. also i dont wriye many reviews, imn fact I think this my very first so, i'm sorry if it sucks lol Its really just me rambling about how the show changed so much since it first aired, its such a differet show now.**\r\nActual review:\r\nDragon Ball Super was anime I absolutely despised, It just spat all over everything that was great about Dragon Ball andDragon Ball Z. Like I would actually look at Dragon ball GT and think that it was indeed the better show, I hated on everything, even before i watched the show lol, so much crap was shown to me through youtube and random articles and I hated it, I really didnt see anything great about it.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the show however? My opiniom has drastically changed, I really like Dragon Ball Super now to the point where i'm bummed out that I caught up to Episode 123, I'm desperate to see the next episode lol.\\n\\n\r\nNow i'll try and explain what my experience was like while watching the show from episode 1 to 123. When i first started things ff, i hated it because it wasjust some over the top, over dramatic and extremely slow paced show that was just doing a horrible job pf redoing the movies Battle Of Gods and Ressurection F. Why was it horrible? because it was compltetely pointless and absolutely no new information was given to the veiwer, absolutely NONE! Its a complete waste of time! Then you have the combat which is as bad as most of you heard, slow and pathetically sluggish! Put a toddler in the fight and it will fight faster and hit harder, hell its reaction timess will bne better too coz these mutha fukaz are completely brain dead the minute somethrew a punch!\\n\\n\r\n---------------> look here for example (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QokA6knnkA0)\\n\\n\r\nThen you have the art and animation just screaming cheap with every scene and every frame, shit was disgusting! I tried to make myself feel better by callling it an after story because it definetly felt like that, an oppurtunity to see my fave characters again and see where they ar now and whats going on after DBZ.  The fights definately felt like an after thought and there was so much pointless drama ourside of the fights, so much time wasted just to see shit like Vegete cook coe food to please a character named Whiss so he can train him. Ok not totally pointless but I stll feklt like my time was being wasted and man, Super has a LOT of pointless shite to see. \\n\\n\r\nLook long sotry short, it was a nightmare to get through and I don't know how I did it...but i'm glad i did. Once the movie reruns were over, the show was beginning to pick up, stilll fucking shit but now its original content and the story was moving forward, the fioghting was still utter trash and stupid shit was still going on but that all began to change when a character named Hit begins to fight in episode 38. You start to see the fights slowly resemble the kind of fights you see in Dragon ball Z, not quite there but its definetly showing up now. now the arc where this fight takes place is called the Universe 6 arc btw.\\n\\n\r\nNow after the universe 6 arc is another one but i'm not ging to say what it is as I think you should see for yourself. Let me just say though that it begins at episode 47 and its a damn good arc, THIS is where Dragon ball Super can be considered a good show because not only are the animation get good, the story itself is really interesting too, I was shocked in how immersed into the story I was and what was going on, I was actually enjoyimg myself now and then i realised that the people behind the show were actually listening to the complaints and making the show better, I never thought that would happen because it usually doesnt but it did. This arc is where they finally found therirsweet spot and figured out how to keep the momentum going and tell a good story on top of that. Like you know that moment when your struggling onsomthing for so llong but then something just clicks? like it just happened one day and verything starts working out and contniyes to work out rom there on? Thats whts going on here, they found the thing that clicked and they stuck with it while improving on it as time passed.\\n\\n\r\nAfter this, the show contnued to improve over time, sure we had some weak moments here and there bt all in all, the show had seriously stepped up up its game to the point where it feels like a completely different show alltogether. The currrent arc does what they been aiming for this whole time. Make Dragon Ball Super more hectic and crazy and over trhe top than DBZ. That scale and pressure froma powerful opponent has finally arrived and they went all out on this guy, you may have heard of him but i wont say a thing for people who don't, watch Dragon ball Super becase it is damn well worth it if your fan of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z.\\n\\n\r\n3 last things to say.  I gotta talk about the characters tho.\\n\\n\r\n1st things first. You remember how so many of the Z fighters became irrelelvent in DBZ since they cant match the power of Goku, Gohan, Vegeta n Piccollo? I wont spoil anything but Super does something fucking awesome with some of the old characters and made em relelvent aagain and that is just fucking amazing! i'm so glad they did hsi because i now have new found respect for the old characters. You have to see it to know exactly what i jean but it works with the story. So awesome seeing em back in action.\\n\\n\r\nSuper also seems self aware of the things we wonder while watching Dragon Ball and actually answers them, they even poke fun at transformations and the chracrrs te d to wait lol. I even learned of things that i didnt think about like why Goku n Vegeta fell for Chi Chi n Bulma despte them constantloy beating the shit out of em. Theres a ton of good info in the show.\\n\\n\r\nFinally the last part of my review. I'm mostly gonna focus on Goku,Gohan, Piccollo n Vegeta because this review is long enough as it is and itll take too long to explain everyone.\\n\\n\r\n-Goku: I feel they fucked his character a nit, He's waaay too laid back now to the point when its time to get serious...he doesnt, its lioke they took is happy go lucky attitutde and lust for fighting and cranked it up to 150%. one example i can give is when Goku lost a fight to someone and Piccolllo saus \"Whats the chanceof me beating this guy? Now itf this was DBZ Goku, he would say \"Honestly Piccollo, your chances of beating him is slim at best, he's really tough\" or somrthing like that but Super Goku just puts his hand behid his head, laughs n saus \"hahahaa nope, you got no chance\" I'm like wtf? Dude, you soud like a complete dick. They also made him seem pretty fuvkin stupid too, lie He's always been slow but never truly stupid or obnoxious, Super however most definetly is all that. Then his lust for fighting takes a whole diffferent level. Theres a point in the story where Goku n friends are gonna battle other chracters but lets just say suttin bad happens to the losers. Its a serious situatiion where DBZ Goku would at least get serious and have a frown on his face at least but Super Goku says \"I don';t care, i just wanna fight stronger people\" I'm like wtf!?  They fuckechim but i think he has definetly improved over the show, like the point im at, he's seems more like old Goku but yh, he's no longer my number 1 favourite character here.\\n\\n\r\n-Vegeta: I always liked Vegeeta but i like him even more in Super, i fel got him just right, he's matured so much, he;s accepted that goku is just someone who is always one step ahead of him and while yh it does piss him off, he's not constanltly ranting about it like before in DBZ, he just pushes himself and fights his own way. I feel sad for the guy whever Goku finds new powers n abilites and he;s just there, in second place, catching up, its infuriating. LET VEGETA GET STRONGER THAN GOKU FFS!!!! Anyway, Vegeta is the mature one, he's not begging for fights like Goku, he lets the fihts come to him and even puts his family above the fights, defimlty a step in the right directionhere.\\n\\n\r\n-Piccollo: Not too much to say about Piccolllo other than you get to see his more faherly side towards Gohan n his daughter lol ,he';s still the same old Piccolllo and thats a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nGoohan: I'm sick and tired of seeing Gohan get strong and then get weakerm WHY DO THEY KEEP FUCKING WITH HIS CHARACTER!? I get he's not a fighting maniac like his dad but cmon, at least give him this thing to want to stay i shape, you knwo>? that whole Saiyan thing? fuck in hell man. As usualy they made him strong again but for how long huh? LOL\\n\\n\r\nWelll thats the end of my review, sorry it was long and sorry is it sucked lol this is my first itme writing one.\\n\\n\r\nBtw, Wanna know the best way o watch? watch it like this in this order for the best experience.\\n\\n\r\nBattle Of Gods Movie------->Episode 18 (maybe 16 and 17 too)------->Ressurection F movie-------->28 and onwards. Fillers is up you.\\n\\n\r\n-tl;dr version:\\n\r\nSuper sucked ass balls at first because it redid the movies but slowly starts to pick up on episode 28 coz its new content but it gets pretty good from episode 47 and it just gets better n better and now feels like a proper ragon all show but with its own feel. Well worth the watch.",

            "content": "At the time of this review, approximately 112 episodes have aired, and we are almost done with the much hyped inter dimensional battle royale arc. And at this point I think it is very fair to say that many of the criticisms of this show are very valid. The animation is crap every three episodes (welcome to shounen battle anime), the first two arcs are overly stretched out retellings of the two newest movies (Battle of the Gods and Resurrection F), and the actually new arcs are incredibly underwhelming to say the least. \r\nIn my opinion, the new arcs being underwhelming has everything to dowith the fact that nothing could live up to the hype that much of Dragonball's audience has hyped up in their heads as THE battle anime. Though Akira toriyama has never been one to craft epic stories, he has been commissioned for them since the first time dbz jumped the shark and made goku a space alien. Not to shit on dbf its good mindless fun but thats what it is. mindless. \\n\\n\r\nI've gotten into a tangent here but my point is that judging DB Super for what it is. It isn't half bad. The action is badass when it wants to (mostly), the plot is best when there is none (hence all the retreading and battle tournaments), and the new characters introduced are sometimes so good I wouldn't mind a spinoff or two following just these new characters. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Start with episode 35 or so (approx when the original storylines start) and give it a whirl. Id just wait for the dubs for the black goku arc. hearing goku and the gang complain about the horrors caused by \"this black guy\" is only funny for about five minutes until they start to say it way too much.",

There's many great moments in this series, and it makes you feel involved watching the evolution of certain characters as they have life changing experiences that really grow on you.

            "content": "Okay, I honestly hate the reception this series has gotten in the past. It had gone through a rough patch when it started and still does go through some of those rough patches to date with its animation and through not explaining things, but I strongly feel that these reviews are not justified in the slightest.\r\nFor starters, the first thing that most people would complain about in this series is the way it begun. For those of you that don't know, Dragon Ball Super begins with two sagas that have taken about a third of the series so far. These were adaptations on the moviesthat came before it (and inspired the continuation of the Dragon Ball franchise). A lot of viewers, myself included, were not thrilled by this reveal since we would just have to re-watch everything all over again, and not to mention that the animation in these episodes were not great in comparison to the original movies. But with these adaptations, I think that they brought more to the franchise as a whole, greater fight scenes, better exposition about the super saiyan god (and blue), more character development and not to mention some call-backs to the original series which I think any long time fan would enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThese, are in my opinion the only real factors that people are judging this series on, and it is not a just way to look at it since it is ignoring all of the things that made this series great. For example, the characters in the series and the character development from the returning cast, Vegeta, in particular, displays how much he had grown since his debut in z. He had started from his own selfish desire to get stronger in order to beat Goku and tackle any and every obstacle in his way, even if doing so puts the sake of the world (or universe) at risk. But, in Super, we see him as a more matured character. Right off the bat, we see him spending time with his family in a way nobody would ever dream of from his character in z. Also, as time went on in the series, you truly do see him care more for the world and all the characters within it instead of being focused solely on himself.\\n\r\nThe Goku Black arc in the later part of the series brought a more serious tone to the series that haven't really been seen so far in the series, at least not to this extent. This time around, we see that the future is entirely destroyed and the population of Earth is down to around the same number as Earth hada fter Majin Boo's Human extinction attack. Everything looks charred, empty and lifeless as the group of humans from the future tries to hold their own against a threat leagues above them. By the end of the arc, that universe as a whole was destroyed entirely and nothing was left to it, showing a true failure from the cast that we aren't really used to as fans of Dragon Ball. The only solution that the heroes had was to travel back in time and rebuild in that version of Earth. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are a few things that are bringing the series down, there are still many other upsides that Super brings to the table that sets itself aside from other popular anime out there (engaging relationships, large multiverse and lore, actual entertaining filler episodes, etc.). \\n\r\nThanks for reading and give Dragon Ball Super a try if you haven't already:)",

            "content": "Everything is great but the filler arcs spout garbage out 60% of the time and have no relevance to a saga after a few arcs. Some Filler arcs are great but when you get to post-black saga, the series gets slightly underwhelming for a long time.\r\nStory is fantastic during arcs, Sound is amazing though recycling music from Kai 2016-2017 is okay I guess. Animation can be a** at times but overall is very amazing and outstanding at points that need it. Overall 80% of fighting in this whole series is better than the movies and or future arcs coming like Black Saga are amazing interms of fighting and plot. \\n\\n\r\nI suggest watching this anime but skip to the Champa Saga if you wish to skip the two movie repeats in sagas from the beginning.",

I have always loved it; it doesn\u2019t matter how many times I visit this world, I always end up admiring its characters, watching them evolve and making their lives grow, experiencing new challenges, and well! What else is to say; Dragon Ball is great! With DBS, I have found myself back in a couch where I used to watch these heroes with my friends. \r\nStill, there are some flaws, the usual complaint is about the drawing style, and it\u2019s true, it\u2019s ridiculous that TOEI is making this kind of errors with anime as beloved. Also, there are repeating already toldstories, TOEI, yes, we want to see our heroes, but in new stories!  And well, the other thing is about the characters; Goku is just plain stupid, I mean, we have always known how Goku is, how innocent and naive can be, but he is just so dumb that if he would have to live in a world as his, it cannot be! Also (spoiler ahead), he gets everyone in danger by an idiotic decision, the thing that would never happen with the old Goku, because even if he is as fanatic fighter as he is, he also worries and loves everyone and everything where he lives. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also kudos for this anime, the new opening is fantastic, characters such as the God of Destruction (Beerus-sama) have made of this new story and engaging one, active, dynamic, and something it make you think and feel. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend everyone to watch this anime, more if you are an old-time fan.\\n",
