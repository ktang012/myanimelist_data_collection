            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma (Food Wars) is an anime about battles of cooking as the title suggests. The anime adaption of the popular manga of the same name has received the same kind of reception as its manga version did in terms of popularity as well as critique. But is it any good or is it just another one of those popular but dull anime, that I will discuss in this review. \r\nStory - 8/10\r\nFrom the synopsis itself, you must have realized that the anime revolves around Soma Yukihira who wants to become a cook and surpass his father in cooking. Some stuff happens and Somaends up in Totsuki Academy, which is the best cooking school in Japan. After all this, you must have come to the conclusion that it isn't unique or special, but that doesn't make it bad. The story isn't anything even special to start off with but the other aspects of the show are so well done that it makes you feel that the story is better than it actually is. Not to say that the story's bad, by any means, it's pretty good but this is not a story-driven anime, it's character-driven.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the show, to be described in one word, is brilliant. While one can say that almost all anime that are released these days have really good animation quality, Shokugeki no Soma's animation is a level above most others. (while not being as good as something made by ufotable but its still very detailed and fluent). The best thing about Food Wars's art is the way they display food, it's just really awesome. The animation is consistent throughout the show and doesn't get bad at any moment. The openings and ending too are animated nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs, are, for the most part, unique as well, with most characters having different features. However, one can argue that Erina Nakiri(one of the female protagonists) looks pretty darn similar to Asuna Yuuki from SAO. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9.5/10\\n\r\nThe first opening is amazing; it a treat to the ears. It's simply beautiful. I am not too good at Japanese so I don't read the lyrics but just listening to the opening psyches you up for the episode. The ending is pretty good too but it still pales in comparison to the opening. (Says how excellent the opening song is). The second opening is good, but it's more of an opening for a fighting/action anime. The first opening was very charming and pleasant, which suits the theme of Shokugeki no Soma. However, the second OP's tone didn't quite suit it, in my opinion. It can be called pretty decent, nonetheless. The second ending is very good to hear too. (And they used the first OP at the end of the final episode 24 of the anime so that means it was the best of the series)\\n\r\nNow, on to the soundtrack, in my opinion, they lack a couple of battle soundtracks which they could use during shokugekis and stuff. There is only one track which played is over and over again, during food battles or while the characters are cooking something for their tests among other stuff. The track named Shokugeki no Soma Epic soundtrack(so much for a good title) on its own is thrilling to hear and you won't probably notice how repetitive it is unless you are watching like 8-9 episodes at once. But if you do watch a few  episodes at once, there is a chance that you will come to complaint about the limited tracks. The limited amount of soundtrack is the only critic I could have in the sound department. The voice acting is funny when required, serious and tension-building during a shokugeki, which is also another plus to the anime. Simply put, the voice acting is almost flawless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe cast in this anime is pretty big, which you would expect from a shounen+school anime like this. There are rivals, friends, upperclassmen, etc but most of the relevant characters have gotten pretty good screentime to express their characters.\\n\\n\r\nOur lovely protagonist, Soma Yukihira is just awesome. He can be OP sometimes with his dishes but he is awesome, nonetheless. He is and is not your typical shounen protagonist. When I say he is your typical shounen protag, I look into the fact that he has a goal of surpassing someone, he is pretty determined to do that, etc. When I say he isn't, the unique features of his characters come out : his confidence, his competence in stuff he does, his arrogance(at times). Now, here his arrogance does a great job because it's really fun to see the opponent's reactions after they are brought down by his words. However, most importantly, he entertains us. For an anime like Food Wars, he is the perfect protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThe two main female characters of the show are damn good :\\n\r\nMegumi Tadokoro is your usual clumsy, scared girl from a small village who hopes of making it big here. While there is nothing much unique about her character, she has done her job well so far and is getting development and she does get braver as the anime progresses.\\n\r\nErina Nakiri is the tsundere who is also known as \"God Tongue\" because of her ability to only acknowledge the best of foods. She is the daughter of the Director(or something big shot of Totsuki at least.) and her family is one of leads in culinary restaurants and other stuff in the world. She is prideful, arrogant and would destroy anything that could stand in her way of being no. 1 in Totsuki; anyone other than Soma. Erina hates Soma and you'll understand why she does after watching the first couple of episodes. The interactions between Soma and Erina are fun to watch, really fun to watch. Although, this season isn't focussed on Erina too much, I am sure she will be getting her time in this coming seasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe remaining characters, too, as I said, are entertaining to watch. Some of their interactions are hilarious while some will show you the intensity of the battles happening in Food Wars.\\n\\n\r\nPros :\\n\\n\r\n1. Extremely entertaining.\\n\r\n2. Amazing comedy and you'll jump out of your seat while watching some of them. \\n\r\n3. Great animation and soundtrack.\\n\r\n4. Immensely amusing character interactions.\\n\\n\r\nCons :\\n\\n\r\nComedy can get out of hand sometimes with the ecchi. If you aren't a fan of ecchi, you might not like the characters' reactions after they eat the food. They get naked and act and act like they're having orgasms. A lot of people have enjoyed this but some might not. However, the good thing is that these get less and less as the anime progresses and by around episode 8, these foodgasms are reduced since the anime starts to get more serious and take off to the skies.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime is a hell of a ride and the entertainment value of the show is right up there. The first episode is nothing compared to what the next few episodes bring to you. The thing got better and better with each passing episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9.5/10 \\n\r\nIn my opinion, Shokugeki no Soma is the best anime released in the year 2015. I guess, the stats it has on MAL speaks for itself.\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this anime to you, even if you are not a fan of such anime, it's worth your time and I am almost certain that you won't regret watching it.\\n",

            "content": "Sorry everyone, I honestly don't know why this show is so highly ranked as it is.\r\nShokugeki no Souma is a train wreck. And when I say this I don't say it lightly - what started out glowing with great potential came crashing and burning once the show got a little over half-way into the season.\r\nThe biggest and most saddening part of Shokugeki is the very poor (or lack of) character development. By throwing way too many characters into the mix, there is simply not enough screen time for most of the main characters. The only person who I would argue went under the most significantchange was Megumi, and even so, her development was incredibly forced - her development was not so much based on her own sheer free will but rather because she wanted to mimic other individuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe other disappointing factor about Shokugeki is the over-stretching (if this is even a word, lol) of the plot towards the latter half of the season. This is especially exemplified by the Autumn Elections. Most of the tournament events could have been condensed into two to four episodes, but since the judges kept talking and basically giving the same, predictable reviews and reactions (\"oh this doesn't look good... but it's so yummy! *insert overly used ecchi animation*), this was easily dragged on and on when it didn't have to be.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does Shokugeki get right? Arguably the humor. The humor is quick, witty, and light and never fails to disappoint. The artwork and sound is also decent, albeit the ecchi animations are way too overused.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Humorous\\n\r\n- Interesting characters, although some were clearly drawn from stereotypical personalities\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Poor plot execution, especially towards the second half of the season\\n\r\n- Poor character development\\n\r\n- Predictable\\n\r\n- Overuse of ecchi scenes - as the saying goes, the same jokes get old fast...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma also goes by the name, Food Wars. However, I\u2019d like to call it more as Food Gasm. The reason being is that the character reactions to food is not what you may expect. Or maybe you will once you see how ridiculously delicious the food actually is. What this show brings forth to the table is more than just a delicious meal though. Shokugeki no Souma is a satirical battle shounen that emphasizes more than just cooking. \r\nBased on the popular manga written by Yuto Tsukuda, the series is adapted into a 2 cour (24 episodes) of the same name. What startedoff as a one-shot has now transformed into this series that essentially makes food look like an exotic beauty. And it all starts with a young boy named Souma Yukihara. Like many young people, he has a dream and in this case, to become a professional chef. In fact, he actually hope to surpass his father and to do that, enlists at an elite culinary school. More precisely known as Totsuki Culinary Academy, it\u2019s here where Souma finds his true challenge and misadventures.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be honest here. This show feels like a classic. And although it doesn\u2019t involve any super powers like some other battle shounen series, Shokugeki no Souma does carry on with similar elements. The main course of the show consists of Souma\u2019s progress at the academy and proving himself as a candidate to becoming a professional chef. Throughout the journey, we also witness him build meaningful relationships with others ranging from friendship and rivalries. The first few episodes clearly establishes that Souma has a strong degree of confidence in his own abilities. His skill is shown first hand when he cooks a meal to overly satisfy Yaeko Minegasaki, an urban life planner who initially threatened to demolish the restaurant he worked at. It\u2019s here where the audience gets a taste of what the show tries appeal through the sexual metaphors and sensation of tasting food. It doesn\u2019t take long for the show to take Soma to a place where he faces off against powerful adversaries including high level chef, Erina Nakiri. \\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma accomplishes with entertainment not just by the storytelling but also through its characters. It has a colorful cast with a diverse range of personalities. From the prideful Erina Nakiri to shy Megumi Tadokoro, we see how their roles are played out through the series. What\u2019s most important is how they interact with others especially in the case of Souma. Because this way, it brings out the best and worst of characters. For Erina, she brings sheer antagonism and rivalry that against Souma. From the first moment they meet, there\u2019s a seemingly bitterness between them. Although Souma takes it more casually, it\u2019s Erina that acts arrogant because of her status and ability. On the other hand, there\u2019s Megumi who is more like the antithesis of Erina. Although she has decent skills of the culinary arts, there\u2019s a lack of confidence in her abilities. Thankfully, Souma slowly brings out her confidence throughout the show. Her partnership with Souma not only bring up Megumi\u2019s confidence but also shows that she does have a place to belong at Totsuki Culinary Academy. At the apex of the mid-season, we see exactly how much she improves herself through experience, confidence, and a willingness to succeed. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, there are many other characters that Soma meets along the way while at the academy. The staff members in particular have shown a particular interest in him such as Kojiro Shinomiya, Fumio Daimido, Senzemon Nakiri, and among others. This establishes the fact that Souma begins to earn the respect that he seemingly deserves. Throughout the show, we also see other characters that challenges him to disapprove of his ego. And this is also sometimes a fault for Souma. While he isn\u2019t overly arrogant, Soma displays a bit of overconfidence when he faces off against certain rivals. This occasionally doesn\u2019t work out as Soma does feels a taste of bitter defeat. The primary example is perhaps with his father as he has a long losing streak against him. Still, a good amount of focus on Souma can also be emphasized on his willingness to help others such as Megumi. He wants others to succeed and seeing them do so motivates himself to make his dream into a reality. At the best of his character, Souma demonstrates superior sportsmanship that deserves utmost respect.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show about culinary arts, you\u2019d all expect a lot of the food cooked in the show to be an eye candy. After all, food is like art that can be treated as beautiful. What the show emphasizes perhaps is a bit of over exaggeration on the reaction when the food is eaten. Just a warning but you\u2019re not a fan of sexual metaphor and satire, then this may not be a show for you. It\u2019s clearly shown that the characters\u2019 reactions can sometimes go overboard. The sheer effort put into the imaginations of the characters upon digesting the food is highly sensational with eroticism. While it isn\u2019t full on nudity, it does satires the food to a point where it becomes naughty. However, I would say that the reaction is appropriate in the case of this series for several reasons. First, it makes the craftsmanship of the various food products into a wonder. It tells (through the explanations of making the food), shows (with carefully crafted visuals), and then reacts with a way that you can expect the food to be. From the moment the first ingredient is set on the table to the last gulp of food down the throat, each episode carefully articulates the way the food is handled. And that is something to really think about. Plus, the show itself also does a neat job with the working mechanics. We get the making of various food dishes explained well through visuals, symbolism, and metaphors. There\u2019s also well timed comedy to make the process less dull. I mean, no one wants to watch every food making process like an instruction manual right?\\n\\n\r\nDespite the series being well done on most respects, it tries perhaps too much on its food war mechanics. Sometimes, it almost feels like the show is advertising itself like a sexualized commercial. There\u2019s good amount of characterization in the series but some of the side characters may easily be forgotten once you finish the show. Plus, the characters you may remember may not be of your taste. These may include Erina whose attitude can almost feel intolerable to get accustomed to. Megumi\u2019s shy behavior also isn\u2019t a strong trait. Even Souma has faults too when he shows weakness. Also, don\u2019t expect romance to develop much in this series. The show is not about Souma finding love but for him to find out if he is truly able to become a professional chef and surpass his father. Finally, the show does omit some parts of the manga. Overall though, it\u2019s still faithful for the fans of the manga that long awaited for the adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nEssentially, I wasn\u2019t sure which studio would handle this series\u2019 artwork. At first, Madhouse and Production I.G. came to mind with their quality. However, J.C. Staff became the engine to make this show\u2019s artwork running. And to be quite frank, it\u2019s fabulously well done. The character designs gives characters unique appearances that makes the most prominent ones stand out. This is especially true for the main leads. Erina is perhaps the girl that stands out the most because of her elegant ouju-sama like presence. Souma also attracts attention as well with his fiery hair that matches with his personality. The school and staff uniforms aren\u2019t designed to look decorate but rather to show their status at the school, as it should be. However, what really stands out about the artwork and visual of the series is the food. They look extravagantly well crafted. Combining elements of delusional fantasy and sensational appeal, each episode highly emphasizes on their design. And of course, do expect fan service as result of the reactions. Outside of the foodgasm, there is also fan service with the characters \u2013 both male and female. These include the eyebrow rising camera angles, alluring clothes of some of the female characters, and in general, something to really service the fans. \\n\\n\r\nIn general, soundtrack is well done although not regarded as a prominent feature of the series. There are two OP/ED theme songs with a decent amount of focus on its coordination. It\u2019s not a technical genius as there\u2019s not much more to draw from the songs themselves besides some of the obvious fan service, symbolism, and foreshadowing. However, the OST delivers a good momentum that carries on each episode. This is especially highlighted during moments when food wars are initiated by certain characters. The thrilling moments of the soundtrack serves up to what the audience anticipates and ultimately makes the show connect itself. The voice mannerism can be a hit or miss although mostly adapts well for characters like Souma with his confidence or Megumi with her increasing confidence level. But you know what really catches the attention of the viewer? Probably the moans and reactions again from tasting the food. It\u2019s not just \u201coh this is delicious!\u201d but more like the moans you hear when someone is having a lot \u201cfun\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time you started or finish this show, you may look at food in a different way than before. As a show that adapts battle shounen with food dishes, Shokugeki no Souma offers a glorious feast to the eye and ear. This is a tasty tale about a guy who cooks not just to show off but to make others happy. And while he is at it, his dream of becoming a professional chef is a journey that\u2019s hard to take eyes off of. I have to also mention that the character cast offers a little of almost everything to the audience. The food itself is irresistible when it comes to the way each episode handles itself. The series may be animated but the sensational feel is a majestic beauty. Sure, it does over exaggerates itself at times. However at the end of the day, it will reach a level of experience that you want to see over and over again.\\n",

            "content": "Imagine that you have a typical tournament-based battle shounen. Now replace the fighting... with food porn. The result is basically Shokugeki no Souma.\r\nThe story takes place at an elite culinary school called T\u014dtsuki Academy; a place so competitive that only about 10% of its students are estimated to ever graduate from it. Enter Yukihira Souma: a confident 15-year-old boy who dreams of becoming a full-time chef at his father's restaurant. In order to do so, Souma enrolls in the prestigious school and has to go through all the ruthless challenges it has to offer as he seeks to slowly but surely climb his way tothe top.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime follows Souma and the other students as they have to accomplish various difficult cooking assignments and challenges under very strict teachers, as well as compete against one another. This is primarily done through a dueling system called the Shokugeki: an official cook-off judged by an unbiased jury which is used as a means to settle debates and disagreements. During a Shokugeki, each competing side must prematurely wager something which is deemed to be of equal value, and they're both obliged to honor their part of the bargain should they be the one to lose the match. In this way, the students can use their cooking skills alone to \"fight\" each other.\\n\\n\r\nSo what exactly is it that makes this anime so good then? Well simply put, Shokugeki no Souma is incredibly entertaining. It is addictive, somewhat original and it keeps making you giggle to yourself at the never-ending foodgasms. Now if you don't know what a foodgasm is, it's basically the orgasm-like reaction a character has when eating something so delicious that they're unable to contain their excitement, and this anime has plenty of that. So yes, there are a lot of ecchi moments, but it somehow fits the show *perfectly*. I don't even know why it's so much fun to watch, but it just is. These reactions are very creative, generally connected to the food in question in some way, and beautifully illustrated accordingly. I might also add that the series' illustrator is originally a hentai mangaka, so it's not really that strange that the eroticism is so on point.\\n\\n\r\nAs a protagonist, Souma is extremely cocky, but also very charismatic. He's the kind of character which you like to cheer for and want to win, which in a competitive story is a pretty big deal. Other characters include the clumsy but kindhearted Megumi, the condescending tsundere Erina who has unparalleled taste buds, the meat-obsessed Nikumi and countless more. As a whole, the character cast is very balanced and diverse, which also results in very different kinds of cooking.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the culinary aspect is pretty interesting in and of itself. If you're interested in trying out some new recipes for yourself, then Shokugeki no Souma has plenty of inspiration for you. The sheer amount of creativity poured into the various exotic dishes in this anime is not to be underestimated. I haven't really tried cooking anything new that I've seen in this show myself as of yet, but there are certainly a handful of things I'd love to try someday.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end, regardless of whether you're primarily watching Shokugeki no Souma for the foodgasms, the cooking or the intense competition, you're probably not going to be left disappointed because the anime does a great job on all three fronts. There's also the fact that this is an almost perfect adaptation of the manga, so even hardcore fans of the source material should most likely be satisfied with it.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, given the huge tease of a cliffhanger ending, we're all going to have to be impatiently rolling our thumbs in eager anticipation for the fateful day when season 2 (hopefully) comes around.",

            "content": "One positive thing I can say about Shokugeki no Souma is that it's an anime that knows exactly what it is - a ridiculously over-the-top sports/battle shounen with cooking as the centerpiece.\r\nIn the beginning, the plot seems familiar, but inviting - our hero Souma is faced with his first opponent - an aggressive businesswoman looking to put his father's humble diner out of commission to make way for her development plans.  We all know she's simply a stepping stone into the universe of this anime. Predictably, she agrees to step down if Souma can impress her with his cooking. And, of course, he defeatsher with relative ease.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an amusing start, and you know there's a much larger story and far more formidable opponents on the road ahead. Unfortunately from here on out, Shokugeki no Souma slowly stumbles into mediocrity as it attempts to constantly out-do itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual gags in SnS are the primary source of its \"ecchi\" tag, which mostly consist of its infamous food-induced orgasms, complete with clothes being torn asunder and physics-defying breasts superimposed on dreamy foodscapes. Funny the first time, but it gets old fast.\\n\\n\r\nThough these scenes don't exist simply for humor, but also to beat you over the head with expository dialogue as to why the dish they're eating is just that good. Imagine your typical anime action battle scene -  a combatant suddenly realizes their opponent's \"secret technique\", and inexplicably begins to blab out loud what is happening, as if they knew we were watching.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is SnS in a nutshell - every shounen trope you can imagine, but with food. This by itself isn't inherently bad, it's simply what it does with them that makes SnS very predictable, tiresome and - despite pulling out all the stops to be as epic as possible - ultimately boring.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story of SnS plays it relatively safe. We are all familiar with the archetype of the unexpected hero and his hometown roots. He's young, highly competitive and determined - albeit a bit naive and a sore loser. Trained under his mysterious and skilled father, he sends him off to a prestigious academy for aspiring chefs. Surrounded by peers of elite and privileged upbringing, he sticks out like a sore thumb - something that sometimes comes to his advantage. It is here Souma will face one greater challenge after another as he fights for the chance to be the very best that no one ever was.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a tried and true classic plotline. It can be inspiring, motivational and relatable in all kinds of ways. It's meant to resonate with the average viewer, and that's great! But there's little reason to be invested in - even if the stakes are high - if we don't care about the characters. Unfortunately, SnS fails in many ways to create compelling characters.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOne glaring issue with SnS is that the main character is almost too perfect. Souma is basically a \"Marty Stu\", or an idealized self-insert that just so happens to excel at everything he does. He seems incapable of doing wrong, making mistakes or showing weakness. Women fawn over him, think about him constantly and even spite eachother in order to win his affection, though he seems blissfully unaware or uninterested in any of it.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Souma is capable of learning things and growing as a person, we don't ever really see it happen - we only see the results of it. And sometimes it happens literally overnight. \\n\\n\r\nSouma's flaws are merely personality quirks, nothing really stops him from reaching the next plateau. His struggle is almost non-existent because of this, and it rarely adds any tension or excitement to his story.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, there are far too many supporting characters that overlap eachother. In 2 cours of SnS we are introduced to over two dozen supporting cast with some kind of backstory and motivation - mostly sharing at least two of the following attributes: 1. the desire to be the best in the academy 2. obsessively competitive and self-righteous 3. the desire to best Souma as a chef - and, as an added bonus, may possibly have some kind of unrequited affection towards him. Granted, not all supporting cast follow this example (for example, the far more compelling and likable Miyoko Houjou), but there are few and they get painfully  little screen time.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, a lot of the supporting cast is generally flat and unlikable outside of Souma's dorm mates. True that many are merely rivals, but this doesn't mean that the character can't be complex and interesting. Sometimes the rivals and villains of a story can be even more compelling than the characters we're supposed to be cheering on.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character that comes from truly humble beginnings and experiences real growth is the female lead Megumi. Her flaws are human, her character is believable, and her struggle is familiar on many levels. Souma is so sickeningly idealized that it makes Megumi stand out even more, and it's hard not to cheer her on. However, with so many other characters competing for screen-time, she is sometimes absent. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nSnS is constantly trying to reach new heights of epic showdowns with the same set-up in every arc. It goes something like this - a new character or characters are introduced, Souma encounters them, and they appear in the next \"cooking battle\". There's monologues, wide-eyed moments of revelation, montages and of course ecchi. They all generally end the same way, though - with Souma edging his way to the next challenge and stunning his seasoned rivals. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem lies in that literally every cooking battle ends in the same way - those judging the food are seen as jaded and impossible to impress. Yet that illusion is instantly shattered as Souma and his peers unexpectedly blow them away every time to the shock of onlookers. But when the audience is shown this over and over from the get-go, it's anything but shocking and the tension is artificial.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time you get to the 6-episode cooking battle finale, you already know exactly what's going to happen. Watching it unfold is hilariously predictable and the whole arc falls flat. There's not much of a resolution either as the manga is ongoing, so the ending feels more like a lull than anything.\\n\\n\r\nOne positive thing to say about the enjoyment factor is that the pacing of SnS is fairly well done. Many anime struggle with pacing, but SnS manages to pack in a lot without seeming rushed or taking too much time here or there. Unfortunately what's happening on screen is not awfully compelling.\\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here besides \"good\". This is by no means an animated masterpiece, but the animation is generally solid and consistent. The art style is also aesthetically pleasing. The only complaint regarding the animation are the sometimes poorly animated bouncing breasts - if you're going to do blatant fanservice, at least do it right. At times the breasts bounce as if they were being flopped around in an exaggerated video game physics engine with no rhyme or reason. Also, the art can sometimes go overboard on the blush with soft red gradients topped with white highlights all over the body. They look like awkwardly large pimples when they're not done subtly.\\n\\n\r\nThe paintings and animation of food are nothing short of stellar. You won't see food this detailed in many other anime. But at the end of the day it is just food and doesn't do much for what's happening in the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is well done and the sound effects will make you hungry (if the food on screen isn't already). \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, despite its many flaws, there are much worse anime than SnS. In this case, it's the cast of SnS that drag down a story and premise that had potential, and the result is something decidedly mediocre. While SnS never loses its focus, it shows all the cards in its hand too quickly, leaving the audience with no surprises left to look forward to.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nWhen I was a kid, I was one of the pickiest eaters known to man. My diet consisted of essentially three edibles: cheese sandwiches, yogurt, and liquids. A cheese sandwich is exactly that: two pieces of cheese resting between two slices of white bread (it had to be white bread). The yogurt was devoid of seeds and covered in sprinkles (it had to have sprinkles). As for the liquids, I stuck mostly to Coca-Cola because it was sugary, sweet, and caffeinated which, considering everything else, was probably providing me the most nutrition.\r\nI did not eat hamburgersor turkey. I loathed fruits and vegetables. I rarely tried new foods, and even when I did, my first reaction was always to spit them out. Birthday parties forced my mother to create sack lunches for me so that I would have something to eat in case all that was served at the barbeque was hotdogs.\\n\\n\r\nThis continued for many years of my life, my daily cheese, sprinkles, and carbonated drinks the only foods my body knew. Until, one day, we pulled through a McDonald\u2019s. I was distraught since literally nothing on the menu was \u201cfor me.\u201d My mother suggested the chicken nuggets. I was mortified. No way, I thought. If I eat those, I know it will taste like pavement. I have never tasted the side of the road before, but my brain locked in on that being the only outcome. Still, my mother ordered the meal and I, rather reluctantly, took a bite.\\n\\n\r\nAt that exact moment, my mind unlocked. It was good. Really good. And from then on, I actually started to eat things. Cheeseburgers and roasted turkey were just the beginning. Tacos, spaghetti, pepperoni pizza were now available, and to this day I have no idea how I did not die from malnutrition.\\n\\n\r\nSo while watching Shokugeki no Souma, I thanked the stars that I had a deep-fried piece of chicken meat those many years ago because otherwise I would not have been able to fully engross myself in the delectable food presented by this equally delectable anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma\u2019s narrative is a refrigerator that works only half the time. When the fridge is on, the contents within are just as they should be: hyped, diverse, and silly, making leftovers fun to munch on. When the fridge is not on, the contents begin to rot, its weak themes and dramatic scenes stinking up the place. The anime never tries to fix its refrigerator, so the outcome is a mixture that is not always easily swallowed.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the figurative meat of Shokugeki no Souma? The narrative consists of essentially four courses: breakfast, lunch, a light snack, and dinner. More specifically, the opening festivities, the training camp arc, the \u201ckaraage\u201d arc, and the so-called Autumn Elections. The purpose of segmenting the plot in this way is the first sign of the anime\u2019s main mantra: hype it up. At all moments and at all points, the show is looking to build on its previous outing, one-upping what it did to entice the audience like a freshly baked loaf of bread. It starts normal, introducing the audience to the main cast of characters and how the \u201cShokugeki\u201d battles proceed. Here, simple tactics such as Souma declaring his superiority and a nighttime taste test against one of the ten leaders plant the seeds of hype from the get-go. Then the plot improves on itself, where the training camp technically expels Megumi and Souma has an omelet disaster during a buffet challenge. Interestingly it tones down slightly, the chicken arc seguing the main plotline to give the viewer a bit of breathing room before the Autumn Elections. When they arrive, the oven\u2019s temperature skyrockets, the intensity almost unbearable from the rapid-fire foodstuffs. Tiny details like the judges failing everyone but the main cast and huge details like having the competitors compete in contrasting carnage \u2013 Nao versus Hisako, Aldini versus Aldini, Souma versus Hayama, and so on \u2013 make it so that the tension and therefore the hype never falters. The show never stops trying to outdo itself, giving it that feel of ramping excitement that comes from stuffing one\u2019s face on an empty stomach.\\n\\n\r\nAs it is with microwaves, Shokugeki no Souma also heats up on the micro scale. This is an anime about food. Food is a mundane subject, a natural and indeed necessary part of life. Meaning that the topic is inherently not exciting. Food can certainly be this way, but the majority of people stick to regular meals of sandwiches and salads. Food is also not normally erotic, calories and fat more nutritional than sexual. Again, foods like that exist: chocolate, whip cream, and strawberries immediately come to the forefront of anyone\u2019s mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime focuses on this whole spectrum of food but with a twist. A giant monk fish here, a crunchy coating there, and peanut-butter-covered squid tentacles just for good measure. The anime takes both the common and the outlandish dishes and turns them into a sensual experience that affects not just the taste buds, but the body, mind, and soul. The show is never content with simply showing the food. No, the anime goes into ingredient-level details, spouting accurate yet useless information about the foods being presented. Useless in the sense that the facts are dry and unimportant to the audience. However, it takes these facts, puts them in a kettle to warm, simmer, and eventually boil over. By the end of each longwinded dissection, the food is not just a rainbow terrine or a cooked lobster but rather an adventure through fairytales and outer space that make the viewer feel as if the world is their oyster.\\n\\n\r\nAt times, the anime can get sentimental with specific scenarios \u2013 like the Aldini brothers\u2019 disparity or Megumi\u2019s struggles \u2013 but when these events are preceded or followed with magical girl caricatures or lewd happenings, it defeats the sincerity of these events. Worse still, these moments distract from the aforementioned hype, comedy, and sex, detracting from what the anime does so well to make room for what the anime does not-so-well. To be fair, the show is trying to provide a well-rounded tale. But since it is at the expense of its best material, it only hampers where it should help.\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma therefore sticks mostly to the same recipe: a new challenge is given, food is made, and ridiculous reactions are had. Such repetition is not automatically an issue since the show incorporates variety as much as possible to spice up its innards. Food selections, character combinations, and ever-expanding events keep the show surprisingly fresh since the scrambling and ballooning of its innards cause the anime to venture into new yet familiar territory. The occasional \u201cecchi\u201d and harem antics further prevent the anime from blending itself into blandness. Parts from before also spill into others. For example, Nikumi\u2019s don bowl downgrade expands her repertoire whereas Souma\u2019s previous failings are reimagined in their reiterations. The show\u2019s relevant themes also shake up the narrative: learning from mistakes, relying on others while also making sure to rely on yourself, the importance of pouring one\u2019s all into every task, and so on.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cRelevant\u201d because cooking requires these ideas. Cooking is more than following a few lines and measurements. Cooking is a process that might involve others, incorrect cups of flour, and most of all determination. It is a skill that teaches other skills in the process. Knowing how to use a mezzaluna or knowing the multitude of spices found throughout the world is not absolutely vital to live. But such skill, knowledge, and more is gained through cooking. It is something that people take part in not because they have to but because they want to. That is what Shokugeki no Souma tries to get at: the notion that cooking is what one makes of it. Plain or avant-garde, easy or hard, cold or hot; each character from Souma to Erina tackles cooking in their own way, subsequently demonstrating cooking\u2019s influential properties. Sadly, the anime does not explore this theme outright. Shokugeki no Souma showcases cooking and talks about cooking indefinitely, but the show does not break down this theme to prove why cooking is as important as it makes it seem. Consequently, and perhaps ironically, the cooking does not have substance in the anime. The show is not wholly concerned with cooking\u2019s \u201cbigger picture.\u201d Instead, the anime\u2019s hype, comedy, and sexual content is all that matters, making its figurative carry-out less appetizing than it could have been.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, Shokugeki no Souma\u2019s narrative is tasty when it wants. The hype, variety, and cooking elements make it worth taking a bite out of even if not every bite is completely satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nShoukugeki no Souma continues treating its audience when it serves its art.\\n\\n\r\nMost notable are the character designs. Each character is without a doubt attractive; the women are given beautiful faces, frames, and figures, and the men are sculpted into pristine statues. But they, like food, have more than superficial appeal. Each character has traits that match their personality and personal characterizations. Some are easy to spot: Megumi\u2019s braided twin-tails give her that country bumpkin look and Marui\u2019s glasses give him the aura of a bookworm. Others are deeper: Nikumi\u2019s skimpy outfits and the emphasis on her breasts match her meat motif and Nao\u2019s stringy black hair and hunching coincide with her warlock-like concoctions. Others still are esoteric: Erina\u2019s purple eyes symbolize the royalty she has secured in the culinary world and Ibusaki, the master of smoke, has hair that acts as a smokescreen for his face. Souma\u2019s fiery and spiky hair representing his passion and adaptiveness, Houjo\u2019s Chinese attire following her similarly originated cuisine, and Alice\u2019s red eyes with contrasting white hair equivalent to her contrasting style of \u201ccooking\u201d are more instances of the intricacies involved with the character designs, demonstrating just how savory they truly are.\\n\\n\r\nJust as savory is the food. Each dish is jam-packed with details, from bubbling cheese to individual rice grains. The food is enticing to see, glistening, soaking, and resting in a state that is nothing short of mouth-watering. Knowing this, Shokugeki no Souma preps itself, taking shots of the food before it is devoured as well as shots of the inside to showcase what treasures are hidden within. For good measure, the aftermath is shown, just to solidify how scrumptious the food would be if it actually existed.\\n\\n\r\nExistence is an interesting topic when it comes to the anime\u2019s art because roughly half of the locations visited are not real. The show obviously takes place in regular locales: a huge kitchen filled with utensils, a fancy hotel lined with red carpeting, a local food market, and so on. It is when the food is consumed that all bets are off. Some characters go to cloud nine, the taste of the food floating the eaters through the sky. Others swim with the fishes, the food so tasty it sends them to a mermaid-filled heaven. Others still feel as if they are frolicking through a forest. In other words, the anime takes advantage of the overreactions to include backgrounds that would not normally be possible given the setting, thereby improving the diversity of the art and thus its execution.\\n\\n\r\nExecution dips slightly when it comes to the show\u2019s actual animation. To reiterate, the anime is always looking to maximize hype. To accomplish this, Shokugeki no Souma relies heavily on still shots of heroic poses and the different foods, meaning there is not much movement. Often times when there is, it is illusory, with camera shaking and \u201cspeed lines\u201d to give the appearance that actions are occurring without actually showing them in full. Of course it can pick up when it wants to \u2013 especially during the \u201cecchi\u201d moments and the big reveals \u2013 but for the most part the show\u2019s animation remains at a passable level.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma is one of those anime that has an enormous cast \u2013 somewhere in the garden of 78 separately named characters. Even eliminating the minor members and some of the side ones from the menu, the cast still numbers roughly 20 people or so. The result is that it is highly unlikely, and indeed highly unfair, to expect each and every person to have huge depth and development (given the episode and time constraints).\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Shokugeki no Souma hits three areas: characterizations, growth, and widespread development. Many of the characters in the show follow the first idea. For instance, Hayama is an exotic man, known for his commanding use of spices and infallible nose. He also has feelings for Jun, his mentor. Houjou is known as a strong, independent woman, fighting the stereotype placed on women in the workforce. Nikumi is the meat master. Marui is the guy who nearly died from exhaustion. Hisako is the herbalist, and so on. Almost everyone has something unique or special about them that makes them standout from their competitors. That is a common but important directional decision: having characters who are unique, who can be differentiated, allows the audience to understand who everyone is and where they are coming from.\\n\\n\r\nSimultaneously, many of the characters see small personal growth. Hayama started out in the slums with no friends and no family, until Jun saved him, thereby creating the emotions he has towards her today. Houjou looked down on \u201cweak\u201d women, becoming the kind of person she despised, until Megumi allowed her to realize that strength comes in all shapes and sizes. Nikumi started off as arrogant, but her time with Souma and the don bowl club allowed the tenderness of her person to finally break free. Marui, despite his initial perception, is beyond knowledgeable, leveraging the numerous books he has studied to become a sort of fake cook. Hisako is not just the secretary to Erina but instead her healer, protecting her from sickness and tribulation, making her position less managing and more cleansing. A long list, but it emphasize that the growth of the characters, while relatively small, is collectively a nice amount that is distributed to practically all of the known players.\\n\\n\r\nArguably, though, some of the characters do not receive enough attention. The biggest victim of this is Erina. She is bossy, arrogant, and mean, although she is shown to have a sensitive and embarrassed side. A connection between her and Souma\u2019s father is alluded to, but it is never outright explored. Beyond these details, there is not much else given about her. This lack of information about a pretty important character can be viewed in two ways. One, that it is a mistake. Not delving into more of Erina\u2019s past or having her around more of the cast so she can have more interactions and therefore more opportunities to grow is a glaring flaw that leads to the static character she became. Two, that it was inevitable. Given her position among the students and her impressive abilities as a chef, she never had the chance in the first place to undergo development. Either way, like someone watching a turkey cooking in the oven on Thanksgiving Day, Erina\u2019s character remains mostly on the outside looking in.\\n\\n\r\nAlice, Erina\u2019s counterpart, is coincidentally in the same pot. Like Erin, she has a servant. She is not as bossy, but she is still rather arrogant. Her cooking style is off-kilter, giving her an edge over the others. But most interesting of all, she is a cousin of Erina\u2019s, meaning their relationship goes beyond mere friendship and rivalry. Despite her mirrored yet connected characterization, Alice is not expounded on. Understandably, Shokugeki no Souma is not a complete tale, meaning that it is very probable that the timer for her development has yet to go off. Therefore, and being somewhat generous, she at least establishes herself as a tough antagonist, both to Souma and to Erina.\\n\\n\r\nA character that has to be investigated is Souma. For all intents and purposes, he is a self-insert character. Souma is super nice, he easily makes friends, he is funny, he is an amazing cook, and he is surrounded by beautiful women. But he is not perfect. Souma makes mistakes, the biggest being his near failure during the buffet. Souma does not always win, evidence being his over 400 losses against his dad and his second place finish in the Autumn Elections. Still, Souma does not change much throughout the season. He is challenged and he expands his culinary abilities, but as a person and consequently as a character, he remains more or less the same from start to finish. The main problem is the anime having to divvy up its resources between 20 or more characters, giving him less kitchen space to work with. Even from the very beginning, his presence and cooking was more to explain and characterize those around him. Erina trying his first dish, Fumio\u2019s empty-pantry challenge, Aldini\u2019s mini-duel, Megumi\u2019s unofficial \u201cShokugeki,\u201d his childhood friend aiding his hometown, and the entirety of the Autumn Elections are individual instances that feature Souma but are not designed with him in mind. Instead, he is a sous chef, not the head chef, acting as the mediator for the character or characters that really matter during those events. The only time where he actually takes the spotlight for himself is the buffet disaster, which makes sense because this is the only time the audience sees Souma in a weakened state. To put it differently, despite being the main character he is never actually the main character, lessening the impact he has on the series overall.\\n\\n\r\nIt is abundantly clear that the strongest character of the anime is Megumi. Before heading to Totsuki Academy, she was the best cook from her hometown, although she quickly discovered that that did not mean much among the cutthroat competition. Away from home and the other students noticing her poor performances, she became lonely, losing any sense of self-esteem. Just when she was about to throw in the apron, Souma appears to reinvigorate her passion for cooking. He becomes her first true friend, his overconfidence and carefree attitude rubbing off on her. For a time this worked. Her first encounter with Shinomiya, however, crushed her spirit. But she fought through this trial, finding her own strength \u2013 homely, feel-good meals \u2013 while simultaneously saving Shinomiya in the process. At this point, she realized that she had gone to the completely opposite end: where she once was doing everything herself and failing, now she was relying too much on everyone around her. Her past is eventually revealed, where she had always been a determined girl but she knew that she could not do what she wanted on her own. Thus, when the Autumn Elections roll around, she uses her newfound strength, consequently letting her find that sweet spot between all and nothing. Megumi goes from bottom of the barrel to cream of the crop, her developmental arc as palpable as possible. In other words, if the rest of the cast is the batter, then Megumi is the icing on the cake.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi, alongside the rest of the characters, has a major theme: everyone can become better than themselves. People have weaknesses: mathematics, driving, and writing are categories where guys and girls alike will willingly declare their ineptitude. Contextually, Erina is bad at getting along with others, Alice is too prideful, and Megumi is easily flustered. But those same guys and girls also have that thing, whatever it may be, that they are good at. It might be organizational skills, hand-eye coordination, or endurance. The same can be said for the characters of Shokugeki no Souma. While each cast member\u2019s specialty deals with cooking in some fashion, they still have one: Erina has her \u201cGod Tongue,\u201d Alice has her gastronomy, Megumi has her home-style cooking, Ryouko has her sake, Yuuki has her hunting, and so on. Everyone has some kind of strength, something that separates them from (nearly) everyone else. So it is about using that strength to become a better person, to realize one\u2019s full potential, and to reach those new heights that previously seemed unattainable. Doing so is never easy \u2013 practicing, training, and failing are unavoidable \u2013 but such hardship is what is required to become someone better than before. And the point is that everyone can do this.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone can become a better person. It simply takes a little bit of elbow grease.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening theme nails that hype feeling. The strumming guitar and rising vocalist resonate with the listener, pumping up the audience as much as possible. The track is actually rather simple, with drums being the only other prominent part of the piece, but the simplicity precisely elevates it into a catchy and therefore memorable arrangement. The second OP somehow heightens the hype even more so than the first. While once again sticking to guitar, drums, and a single vocalist to power the piece, the guitar is harder, the flurry of drums is more energizing, and the vocalist is more emotional. The result: another stellar and exciting piece that stays with the audience long after an episode and the series concludes.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme is not like its OP counterparts in more ways than one. Putting it lightly, the first ED is arguably one of the best ever conceived in the medium. The track encapsulates all that food is: food is light, fluffy, and spicy; yummy, flavorful, and warm; simple, complex, and fun. The rising and falling guitar, the onomatopoeia, and the heartfelt vocalist, alongside the mellow beat and catchy lyrics, make these \u201cfeelings\u201d known, ultimately creating a five-star piece.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the second ED, it takes time to warm up to, especially considering the juggernaut it had to replace. The vocalist seems incapable of carrying the piece and the instruments are all over the place. In short, it appears to be a disaster. However, when context is considered, the piece is quite clever: this is a track from and about Nao, the stalker, the socially awkward girl, the strangest woman at the academy. Knowing this, the track comes together, meaning its disjointed and disruptive arrangement not only makes sense but makes the piece ironically funny.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the soundtrack is an orchestral feast for the ears, utilizing pieces of every part of the musical pie. Slice-of-life ensembles to keep the low-key moments light on the stomach and therefore lighthearted. Intense violin tracks accompanied by acoustic guitars to amplify the emotions. And suspenseful pieces coated in hard piano notes and ambient choirs to make those current, on-screen deliberations that much more tantalizing. Also, \u201cWelcome to the World of Gourmet Foods,\u201d with its churchlike sounds and opera-esque lyrics, is the only piece that could fit those majestic moments. The OST offers a wide selection, from the culturally influenced to the personality driven to everything in-between, making it worthy of seconds, thirds, and more.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting performances in Shokugeki no Souma are far above average, with each voice actor and actress providing well-done work across the board. Risa Taneda as Erina gives a pompous voice that captures Erina\u2019s equally pompous attitude. Minami Takahashi as Megumi stars in her first big major role, switching accents and sounding cute to match Megumi\u2019s similar disposition. And Mamiko Noto as Hinako for her mature yet childish voice aligns with Hinako\u2019s own personality.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nErina is one of my favorite characters from this show. Some might not like the 90-to-10 \u201ctsun\u201d-to-\u201cdere\u201d ratio she has going on, but when that outer shell does breakdown (however infrequent it might be), it was always hilarious and adorable to witness. Alice is another fun character because she is just so confident with herself all of the time that when people do not \u201cget\u201d her and her cooking, she likewise gets cute and it simply makes me smile. And of course, Megumi\u2019s constant apologizing, clumsiness, and general affability never failed to make me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, each character is more or less likable. The women and the men are meant to be attractive, but each has their shtick much like Erina, Alice, and Megumi. Souma\u2019s smug chuckle is super contagious. Hisako\u2019s \u201cyuri\u201d feelings towards Erina are awesome. Takumi always getting cut off when he tries to act super-cool towards Souma never got old. Hinako fawning over Megumi is something that I wanted to see happen nonstop. Nikumi\u2019s blushing whenever anything Souma-related was brought up was way too cute to handle. The list goes on and on. From the comedy to the \u201cecchi\u201d to the food, the show always wanted, if nothing else, fun.\\n\\n\r\nThat is the anime\u2019s strong suit: providing an impossibly fun time. The characters, the battles, the music; everything comes together in this neat little package that, when opened, bursts forth as this undeniably exhilarating anime. Hearing Souma and Erina hum the first ED interchangeably, watching the judges go overboard with their reactions, and seeing Yuuki acting beyond silly are designed to make the audience feel good about themselves and therefore feel good about the show. The anime is ridiculous \u2013 food is not that over-the-top \u2013 but that is exactly why it strikes a chord with nearly everyone who views it. The show is absurd. It is entertaining. And that is what makes it so gosh darn fun.\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma is a hearty meal that fills the stomach and warms the soul. The juicy, seared narrative is charred but tender. Corn-on-the-cob, slathered in characterizations and developments, sits nearby. Home-cooked art that is slightly sweet. An ice cool set of soundtracks to wash it all down. The meal is clearly not perfect but because it is filled with love these imperfections do not outright ruin what this plate offers. That is to say, not even a dude who only eats cheese sandwiches, yogurt-with-sprinkles, and Coca-Cola would pass this one up.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, hype to the max, constant variety avoids gross repetition, but its lack of a purposeful theme and detracting sentimental material sours what should be sweet\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, awesome character designs, mouth-watering food, interesting backgrounds, and about average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, majority of the cast is characterized and developed proportionally well, Souma is individually subpar but purposeful for others, Megumi is great, and the theme on betterment through personal strength is a welcome bonus\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, great first OP, great second OP, fantastic first ED, good second ED, great OST, above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, the entire cast, and indeed the entire season, is never-ending fun\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "Anime and manga are known to have the potential to make a subject that for most audiences is uninteresting to a compelling, enjoyable experience: such is the case of cooking. This theme has been explored before with less succesful titles such as \"Koufuku Graffiti\" or \"Bonjour Koiaji Patiesere\", but with Shokugeki no Soma it seems to have a huge success among the audiences, but why? \r\n~Story~\r\nThe story of Shokugeki no Soma is quite straightforward: Yukihira Soma pursues to become a full-time chef in the restaurant of his father, the reason why he has to surpass his father's culinary skill. In order to achieve his goals,Soma's father sends him to an elite culinary school, Toutsuki High School, where only 10% of the students graduate. What is more, Soma makes himself the enemy of the high school on his very first day.\\n\\n\r\nIn this high school there is one exceptional rule: any grudges/disputes are held with so-called \"Shokugeki\" (hence the title of the anime) or cooking battles between the students to prove their culinary skill before judges. How the story proceeds is curious, as instead of actual class lessons about cooking itself, the spectator is shown constant tests and shokugeki's between the students,in particular those of Soma. This displays the harsh conditions of the school, while at the same time keeping the story exciting. However, this leads to a problem: there is no realistic character development that takes place (cooking wise) and most of the ingredients and cooking techniques used are explained briefly. This can be an issue for the spectators looking for more detailed cooking.\\n\\n\r\nThe nature of the plot makes the story very predictable and formulaic, however it is interesting to observe through the difficulties and mysteries that surge throughout the anime how everything is executed and developed. Some spectators may ask themselves how the quality of the cooking is displayed; this done through \"foodgasms\", including breaking of clothes, for both male and female. While the idea is interesting, it was at times too exaggerated.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThere is a big cast of characters displayed in Shokugeki no Soma, all being introduced as the story progresses. There is the main character Yukihira Soma, who is skilled in cooking itself,has no romantic interest, is arrogant and ignorant, which bothers on stupidity. This is nevertheless a good quality for the protagonists as it leads to amusing situations as well as enhancing the pacing of the story. Then you have female protagonists, such as Nakiri Erina, the one who rejects Soma in any possible manner due to their opposite philosophies on cooking; Tadokoro Megumi, the shy and unhandy village girl... The rest of the cast includes rivals, friends, parents, you name it, all with their own charm and personality.\\n\\n\r\nAn interesting aspect of the characters is that each has attributed a certain speciality in the culinary scene, with their corresponding nickname: specialists in the smoking of food, spices specialist, herbal medicine, italian food, stinking food, you name it.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development so far is nothing impressive. However, the spectator can observe through little background stories how personalities develop and the reason why certain characters have that particular personality.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and Sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of Shokugeki no Soma is well done, what is to be expected of a show airing in 2015. The animation of the characters are fluid and are well designed and very varied, making it easier for the audience to distinguish the different characters. The backgrounds are often well animated and have at times good detail. One thing that stands out is how the food is displayed, which is done through good use of the different colours available.\\n\\n\r\nTo find a fitting soundtrack for a cooking anime is difficult, and in this case some of the soundtracks used didn't quite fit the atmosphere for the anime, in particular the ones used in the shokugeki's. It nevertheless fulfills its purpose. It was nice that the staff decided to use \"Tropical Gateway\" from Duke Starwalker.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Soma was overall a very enjoyable experience, even with the predictable and formulaic approach on the story, which was compensated with the different plot twists and development of the different cooking contests, and the characters; the ecchi scenes may be a drawback for some. I can recommend this anime to anyone who likes shonens and those who are interested in cooking, though you won't learn anything groundbreaking. Note that this anime is unfinished, and thus has an open ending.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma. . . Where do I begin with this show? Well, let's start with the common description that's been drifting around the internet since its airing-- \"Food Porn\". It's an understandable title, really. Every episode features numerous mouth watering dishes that we the audience can't help but lust after. With most (if not all) episodes also featuring a foodgasm it's an apt moniker. That may cause some misconceptions however. By that description alone you may assume this to just be another throw away ecchi show. I won't lie, I had similar thoughts after the first episode that featured a truly terrifying scene involvingtentacles and a naked woman. Luckily I'm not one to dismiss a show after a single episode and I'm thankful I didn't. (And these tentacles do rear their slimy tips on occasion, but they thankfully recede quickly... *shudder* I know you niche guys with the fetish aren't pleased by that info, but the rest of us are!)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nYoung high-school aged guy, bad-ass father that leaves the country, elite institution for the best of the best where our young hero will face overwhelming odds on a daily basis to prove his worth! This is a Shounen battle anime in every sense of the term. That being said it's a battle of culinary skill rather than a brawl with fists. I can't really get into a lot of battle Shounen, I have a difficult time feeling engaged when no matter how much fighting occurs everyone is allowed to walk away. That's why this series works though! These aren't life or death contests but rather a contest of one's future and pride. \\n\r\nOne aspect of this story that I love is the way our main character Souma isn't an underdog. Sure, a lot of people look down on him, but that's due to their asinine judgment rather than his actual skill. He is a damn good cook! He knows what he's doing in the kitchen and will put others to shame. Rather than starting from the bottom to work his way to the top, he is already close to the top and has to battle those who made it there with him. \\n\r\nThe story sounds relatively clich\u00e9, but most are in this day and age. However, it is well executed. There are constant challenges for our characters to overcome, and none of them feel contrived. The nature of the school they attend calls for consistent challenges, but there is time in between these events. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe animation is great. I never dreamed food could look so superb animated. I find myself thinking \"Does fried rice look that good in real life? I don't care, I need fried rice!!\" Only to promptly be disappointed when the fried rice I prepared doesn't look quite as amazing as the one portrayed in the anime. (Still tasted good though, in case you were wondering). J.C Staff is awarded full points in my book for making the food feel so enticing. It's an ecchi show but my eyes are drawn towards the hot dish on the plate rather than the hot female who just prepared it. (Pardon the quip, I'm making a point here.)\\n\r\nThe colors are vibrant and make the entire show exceedingly easy on the eyes. The character designs are very nice. I give genuine applause to the artist of the manga for incorporating so many different styles into the characters. No two look alike and all have some sort of flare to make them memorable. \\n\r\nThe first opening is nice and pleasant to look at with sequences of animation that have become fairly standard for openings in this day and age. The ending is a slightly different story; featuring nude, chibi versions of all the characters riding some sort of food. It's remarkably odd to say the least. And I don't know who in the past few years came up with the idea to take a floor polisher to the shoulders, knees, elbows and boobs of characters, but it really isn't necessary. Not necessarily bad, but I don't see a point. I mention it because my eyes were almost glued to those raw areas that look like they'd be extremely painful... But the pinnacle of this ending is the Last Supper imagery. I think the anime is hinting at Souma being the Messiah of cooking. He was sent there by his father, he shows up and shatters all the existing laws and standards, he makes bold declarations people don't like, yadda yadda yadda. Damn... That actually really works... O.o\\n\r\nThe second opening though, damn is it good. Translated to English this show is titled as \"Food Wars!\" and this opening makes you remember that. Gigantic ladle vs. the world's 4th largest fork. Imagery of the demon chef challenging the revered goddess. Planet Earth sitting in a soup-bowl. I think I saw a light-saber somewhere, still not sure on that one. But damn, when combined with the music I got hyped for every single episode!\\n\r\nOh, and just in the off-chance that you're curious, the 2nd ending... I don't really like to talk about that... Why you ask? Well, its actually kinda creepy. I'd rather not recall that girl...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe OST did it's job. The music is appropriate for the scene, but there aren't any tracks that had that \"wow\" factor. Not to say it didn't do it's job. The intense moments have epic or triumphant music, the more lighthearted scenes have matching melodies.\\n\r\nThe first opening song \"Kibou no Uta\"  is actually really good. I wasn't sold the first time listening to it, but the almost hoarse sound of the vocalist really grew on me. The first ending \"Spice\" is far catchier than it should be, I can't even begin to count how many times that song has gotten stuck in my head. The second opening \"Rising Rainbow\" is awesome. Every time that song played I felt myself getting hyped and excited for the episode to come. I mean, I was already hyped every time I clicked \"play\", but this song just sends the thrusters into overdrive!\\n\r\nThe acting is actually really, really well done. The casting was spot on and the actors/actresses nailed the duality of the characters. There isn't that one moment where you're blown away by their performances, but there's a consistent level of quality that just makes itself apparent. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nJust as you might expect from a Shounen there's a fairly large cast:\\n\r\nSouma Yukihira- The main character of the show and an excellent addition to Shounen protagonists. I mentioned earlier how Souma was actually skilled, but what makes him standout is that he's also rather arrogant. He knows he's a good cook and isn't afraid to prove it. He got this way because he has an unrivaled determination; he worked his ass off to get his skills and takes pride in them. To accompany this arrogance is a semi-permanent state of uncaring ignorance. A famous chef? He doesn't know nor care. Prestigious institution? He's never heard of it. A rival who doesn't like him? He'll speak to them in a pleasant manner and taunt their dramatics. His ignorance borders on stupidity but creates glorious situations because he's so laid-back. Souma is also a really nice guy who isn't foolish enough to downplay the skill of others. He recognizes talent and respects it. \\n\r\nErina Nakiri- The high-class bitch with a god complex. At least, that's the initial impression we see from her. Though still early in her character, we can tell that deep down she's a tsundere with an extra dose of tsun. So, a tsun-tsundere? Bad joke? Yeah, but I think it's accurate. She's demeaning, ruthless, and sadistic. She really is a complete and total bitch. But you know, I really like Erina. Maybe my perspective is a bit skewed because I can see the future (well, I read the manga... same thing, really), but Erina really grew on me with time. \\n\r\nMegumi Tadokoro- The shy, nervous, apprehensive hometown girl. Megumi is sweet, likable, and extremely prone to panicking. She doesn't show the best cooking skills, but no matter what you're going to want to pull for her. Megumi's the girl that you just can't help but love. She's like a newborn puppy or kitten. You look at them, tilt your head, say \"awwww\" and just smile as they go around tripping on themselves as they learn to walk. If you dislike Megumi, admit yourself because you're insane. The question of her as the main heroine is more debatable, but you're going to love this girl. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters include a wide array of friends, rivals, friend-rivals, teachers, and Souma's dad (who's pretty much all of the aforementioned roles). Despite being minor characters they're all memorable and relatively unique. And though I'm not delving into detail about them, they really do form a great cast. I previously mentioned \"duality\" in regards to the voice acting, there's a very simple reason for that- a character may be drastically different when they're cooking as opposed to when they're not. Or depending on who they're around they may undergo a bit of a 180.\\n\r\nA small shout-out to Isshiki-senpai, the guy that pulls off the naked apron with an unrivaled amount of vigor. His fan-girls are not without their reasons. Oh, and a second shout-out to Alice von Einzbern. Wait, my bad, the white hair, pale skin, and red eyes threw me through a loop. Alice Nakiri, I remember now. I'm not quite sure how to describe her, but maybe I'll use the phrase \"chibi pouting and/or chibi amazement\". An adorable character to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis show was an absolute pleasure to watch. It's fun and crazy with a decent splash of ecchi to keep your eyes riveted to the screen. But it also has a pretty damn good growth story about a guy chasing his dreams. The food contests are intense, the foodgasms are riveting in a horrible yet spectacular fashion, and the show has been just one huge gigantic ball of fun and excitement. This show was definitely one of the most enjoyable shows of 2015.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma is nothing short of fantastic. I was captivated by the story to such a degree that I couldn't contain my curiosity and I set out to read the manga. After binge reading for two days straight I caught up to the manga and I can say with certainty that since we've been graced with another season, this show has only just touched the tip of the ice-berg. More Shokugekis, more rivals, foodgasms galore, and character development are all aspects one can expect for this show and whatever else may follow. Oh, and a just as a side-note, this was a faithful adaptation to the manga. Nothing was cut out except for one epic Ping Pong match -sadface-, and nothing was rushed. \\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma was the surprise hit of the season for me. No, not even the season, all of 2015. I never would have anticipated this level of excitement from a show revolving around a culinary institute for teenagers. It's comedic, it's intense, and somehow it's all about cooking!",

With many a aspiring chef coming to showcase their culinary chops, we follow the story today of an anime character named Souma, and his road to culinary greatness in, Shokugeki no Souma, Food Wars!  Let's dig in!\r\nStory: Yukihira Souma is the son of the man Yukihiro Junichiro, a man who owns only but a lowly diner.  Being an aspiring chef, Souma wishes nothing more than to best his father and proudly take over the diner as its head chef and owner.  After being confronted by somepushy buyers for the land that the diner is on, Souma valiantly protects the diner that he treasures, and successfully pushes the buyers away, he is then told by his father that for his years in high school, he will be going to the a cooking academy to learn how to cook.  BUT THIS ISN'T YOUR AVERAGE COOKING ACADEMY!  It is Tootsuki Academy, one of the most prestigious cooking school with a graduation rate of apparently, only a literal 10 people successfully passing through the third year of school.  \\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma acts a lot like your average tournament anime/manga, only this time, there's cooking involved in the battles rather than sword fights, magic fights, or what have you.  With each group of episodes, one or more characters participate in some kind of battle since the setting, Tootsuki Academy, encourages fights between the students in order to hone their skills called Shokugeki.  (Basically, food war.  Hey, that's the title of the series!)  With this concept in mind, each character as a result acts as a different opponent to our main protagonist Souma, each of whom bring their own \"weapon\" with them like a general tournament anime with the \"weapon\" being each character's own cooking style and specialty in the culinary world.  \\n\\n\r\nThe downfall of this story, especially in part due to the time constraint of a general length of an anime, is the fact that that's really all the story has to offer.  Every episode or small group of episodes is devoted entirely to a specific battle within the series, with the possibility of prompting some character development in some select people.  (Usually, it's the generic rival declaration or enemy turned friend sort of deal.)  Plus, due to the show's entire devotion to food, there is a lot of tasting that goes on in this series to the point that they devote entire episodes solely on just tasting one dish or two dishes purely because there are characters that have so much to say about it.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the show's comedy (since this show does actually have a bit of a comedy factor to it), Shokugeki no Souma mostly draws this from Souma's extremely nonchalant and sometimes innocent attitude towards things.  If someone is challenging him, he'll just brush it off as a joke and wish them luck in the next confrontation.  If someone is saying he'll fail, he'll just sit their silently, cook, then prove them wrong with a straight face.  Several characters also do this style of nonchalantness, thus adding to it, but no one comes as near frequency as what Souma does in this series.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Shokugeki no Souma is your typical tournament anime, just with food as its battle of choice rather than a bloodbath in an arena, or what have you.  The issue I have with the ending in particular is the fact that they don't end it at the end of an arc, rather, just stopping in the middle of one.  This as a result puts a sour taste in my mouth because this is essentially a \"read the manga\" ending.  (Damnit J.C. Staff.  Not again!)  They don't resolve it in as comfortable place as I would like it to be, and as such, is a bit of a disappointment in that regard.  But, you get to learn a lot about food as you're watching this show, so that's a plus.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Food-based anime  (Because there honestly aren't a lot of these.)\\n\r\n+ Casual comedy \\n\r\n+ Food learning\\n\r\n-  Generic tournament based anime\\n\r\n-  Open ending  (Ending in the middle of an arc is a fatal error for an anime IMO.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Shokugeki no Souma's characters as well follow your same traditional style of tournament anime characters.  Each character acts as either an ally or an enemy for our main protagonist, with each of them equipped with a different cooking style to separate each of them from one another.  \\n\\n\r\nUp first is our main protagonist, Yukihira Souma.  As mentioned before, Souma is a very nonchalant character, completely confident in his abilities as a chef and never backs away from a challenge.  This in turn, creates a bit of a arrogant feeling to his character as he in the series, continuously showcases his cooking prowess and his style of \"Yukihira\" cooking, which is basically adaptive cooking, to put it in simple terms.  In the show, Souma doesn't particularly change all that much.  You get a sense of him as a character as he goes through the various battles in the series, but there isn't any real growth to him as a character.  He's very nonchalant as he goes through whatever situation he's in and as a result of his sort of \"beginner's luck\", doesn't really change because the outcome is always favorable to him.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Tadokoro Megumi, the sort of sidekick to our main character.  With \"home-style\" cooking as her main weapon of choice, Megumi is the shy girl in the corner who always tries to hang in there by a thread.  As a result, Megumi serves a lot of the time as the cute, shy girl who always tries her best in cooking better and becoming more independent.  As the series goes on, you get to see Megumi progress through the various challenges that she goes through, which ends up creating some rather nice character development.  As a result of this, she is actually more of a developed character than Souma is in the show, regardless of the fact that she appears less often than that of the main protagonist.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, we have Nakiri Erina, the \"high and mighty bitch-like\" character in the series.  With regal or elegant cooking as her forte, Erina reflects that by being one of the currently best talents that the Academy has to offer in its 92nd generation.  Acting like more of a side character for the series, Erina acts like that one character that you just love to hate.  She doesn't do much in the series aside from stand in the background and criticize what, especially Souma, is doing, and as a result isn't a phenomenal character at all.  She lacks in simple involvement in the series so there's that as a flaw for her even though she was one of the few characters showcased in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast as I have mentioned before are various \"warriors\" in this tournament style anime, that serve as both allies and enemies of Souma.  We have Yuki, a master at game cooking, Ryoko, who specializes in fermentation, Shun, who loves a good smoking, and so on and so forth.  Most of these characters act as either fillers for character roles, or obstacles for Souma.  The is in part because of the tournament style of storytelling because the ones who are considered as \"allies\" don't show off as often, and inversely, the \"enemies\" or \"rivals\" on the other hand, do, since they pose a threat to our main protagonist.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Some character development for select characters\\n\r\n-  Main protagonist stays very static throughout the whole series\\n\r\n-  Side characters mostly act as plot devices to progress the story\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by J.C. staff, Shokugeki no Souma uses a very bright style of animation where the colors just pop out at you with relatively good detail.  The characters themselves are nicely detailed, and the overall animation doesn't particularly change all that much for the series, except for three different areas that I suppose, make Shokugeki unique.  \\n\\n\r\nThe least exciting of the three is the comedic areas, where the characters are simply just drawn in a simpler aspect with less details and occasional slight chibification.  As such, there's not a particularly large amount to say about it since it's mostly just all exaggerated expressions and a couple background changes.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have food.  Out of every area of art in the series, Shokugeki's food is some of the most fantastic animation I have seen out of it.  Because the series puts so much emphasis to the dishes that the characters make, J.C. Staff has done good by devoting a crapload of time and energy into making the dishes look like literal pieces of art.  They look very good to the point that you just sort of want to reach in and take a bite.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, we have the animation that this show is famous for, the food porn.  Yes, you heard me right, food porn.  (I waited all the way till now to talk about this.)  The concept of a foodgasm is very common in this anime in particular.  Because the show involves a lot of tasting of dishes, in order to encapsulate what the characters eating the food are feeling, Shokugeki no Souma always puts in some kind of imagery in order to create something in order to explain the feeling of bliss or what have you when eating the food.  As such, the food is so good that in their foodgasm fantasies, clothes rip off, people sometimes get violated by tentacles, and there are quite a few lewd-like screams.  And with the way most of the girls in this series are drawn, oh boy, they took advantage of the opportunity.  This...creates a very interesting dynamic for the series and one of the main draws of the show.  Because apparently, getting violated by yogurt and squid after eating a horrible concoction of those two ingredients equates to you getting violated by said tentacles in your mind.  There's also manservice too for all you ladies out there, so it's equal, probably.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good animation\\n\r\n+ Great looking food\\n\r\n+/-  Foodgasm ecchi scenes  (This of course, varies on how you view ecchi.)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack of Shokugeki no Souma consists of two sets of OP's and ED's.  Outright, the ED's really aren't all that memorable.  Sure, they're fun little tracks that bring the joy of just eating, but there really isn't much substance to either one of them, which is a shame because the openings are pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nInversely, the two OP's of the show follow two completely different tones.  A casual and joyful tone for its first OP in order to illustrate the beginning of the journey and the beginning to the road to greatness, and the second OP which follows the more \"serious\" side of the anime involving Shokugekis and other food wars to settle differences between characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good OP's the reflect the show\\n\r\n-  Average ED's in comparison\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: So, all in all, did I enjoy food wars?  As someone who doesn't actively search tournament style anime, Shokugeki no Souma was a rather interesting experience.  It followed the anime portion that it covered to the letter, and put everyone in their right places in terms of where they come in, how they come in, and how they interact with each other.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI in fact, did.  There was always that sweet satisfaction of Souma confidently presenting an odd dish before earning high praises because of how casual he is to just about everything.  There were also a lot of characters that I particularly liked regardless of their lack of any proper roundness of a character, and I just simply liked how hungry the series made me.  (I think I made myself something eat after each episode after at least every other week.)\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I enjoy about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint about the series from my standpoint, is the fact that it ends in the middle of an arc.  I always find that to be a dangerous call because the creators end it in someplace that doesn't tell the whole story of what's going on, leading to some unanswered questions, questions that shouldn't be left over since it doesn't give the show a proper explanation for them.  (And it doesn't look like there's going to be a season 2 any time soon.)  Some of the scenes also made me a bit uncomfortable to watch.  Since the original mangaka used to be a hentai artist, well...you can see where I'm going with this.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of both ecchi and tournament anime, man do I have the anime for you.  Shokugeki no Souma is a series entirely devoted on cooking various dishes and comparing them to each other via Iron Chef style in order to prove which one is better; that's literally the entire series.  As a result, if you're not a fan of linear plotlines like that, then you may reconsider watching this.  But if you don't mind that, or the ecchi and sheer talking that this series is somewhat plagued with, then give it a shot, you might just like it when you try it.",

            "content": "Is this anime about food or po*n?\r\nDespite the criticism \"ecchi\" genre receives, it is really one of the hardest shows to achieve perfection. It is hard to find the right balance between storyline and lust. And Shokugeki no Souma is a perfect example of what not to do in this genre.\r\nJoin Yukihira Sora on his journey to become a master chef, in which every single judge is like Gordon Ramsey and doesn't give a god da*n about just eating food. You know... quite a lot of people live on ramen you know... And as long as it's cooked properly, it's edible god damn it. Butironically, when it comes to the POWER OF FRIENDSHIP, all cooks become like me, just complimenting on any edible food.\\n\\n\r\nTL DR; This show is utter garbage. There is not a compelling story unlike literature and the already barren plot is plagued with scenes that resemble hentai.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\r\nI totally don't get where the story is going. This is the one show where the fan service just totally destroys the storyline. There are just too many useless fan services and I really can't tell whether I am watching HENTAI or anime. Seriously, the VAs kinda make it sound like it is the former. The results of any food competition just seems BS and the story is just full of holes to make any outcome convenient to explain. This lacks all elements from Aristotle's Seven Golden Rules to storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe development of the characters are really poor - like Tadokoro for example - she just straight up goes from the worst cook in the school to the best. Zero explanations. Romantic developments are utter trash. And the story itself is just as boring as possible. And they just seem to add more overpowered cooks just to get the show going. \\n\\n\r\nAnd why are there even fan services in an anime supposed to be about food? Why are there even \"food orgasims\" in the first place? Nobody does that in real life. This show already didn't have a plot and this just ruined it even more.\\n\\n\r\nAfter some time, I just skipped all cooking scenes to the results.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I'm not giving this 1/10 is because it is not a propaganda.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is utter trash; I don't get why this is so popular.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nWell, people like the fan service shots. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nI generally don't give any ratings below 7/10 on this, but the VAs makes this sound like po*n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nWell, there are a bunch of fan service characters, bunch of side characters that are just thrown away and an MC with a boring past. \\n\r\nWell, works alright for pornography.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nSeriously, just watch hentai instead or something if you are watching for the fan service shots. This show just sucked. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nThis show is between 2/10 and 3/10. I reserve scores lower than this for the absolute worst. But this anime already is a disgrace to the storytelling medium. If you are really into food, just watch any Gordon Ramsey.",

            "content": "I had watched the first episode of Shokugeki when it aired, but dropped it when I realised it would be nothing but Cooking with Gary Stu. When I learnt this anime would have a sequel, I finally decided to see if it was worth it. Perhaps it improves after the first episode and I was being too harsh, I thought with all my heart. After all, it is sitting at a solid 8.6. And so I watched it. Turns out my original hypothesis was correct: It's a load of shit. Well, now instead of wondering about it, I can at least objectively state Shokugeki noSoma is pathetic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nI will say the premise behind Shokugeki is not bad. It's about cooking and battling, comparing skills with chefs of higher skill (mainly those of the Elite Ten) to become a better chef. Unfortunately, the execution needs a bit of work.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the first half of the show is boring. From the beginning our protagonist Soma is presented as nearly perfect. I'll go into more detail about him at the characters sections, but as far as the story goes, because Soma is so proficient at what he does, the plot instantly becomes predictable. Over 80% of this show is Soma facing off against someone who is meant to be higher in skill than him, whether they be part of the Elite Ten or not, but episode after episode he continues to dish out food so good it makes women (on rare occasion men) uncontrollably cream themselves. When the equation for every episode, especially in the beginning, follows as Soma + Ingredients + Cooking skills that surpass Gordon Ramsay = Food that can manipulate anyone to do anything, I already know what will happen in episodes five, six, so on... In the words of Edgeworth from 'Boot to the Head': \"How predictably boring...\"\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the ecchi. To put it bluntly, it was overused. I don't have an issue with it if it pops up to 'spice things up a bit.' A good example here is Code Geass. Every once in a while there was a boob/panty-shot to lighten the atmosphere of a rather serious anime. Good. This is how it should be used. But when those shots BECOME the plot, it ruins an anime. Since we're talking about cooking, imagine ecchi like a fine spice. Sprinkled in, it adds a bit of flavour to an already good dish. Poured on haphazardly like the cap fell off a saltshaker makes a meal absolutely disgusting and inedible. Probably the best formula I've found for this is: If you take out the ecchi of a story and you no longer have a plausible plot, you might as well call it hentai. At least Shokugeki admits what it is, but even so, I'm not watching this to masturbate, so the show becomes even more boring and predictable.\\n\\n\r\nThirdly, and I will admit this is a bit of a nitpicky one, but the story jumped around a bit too much. Usually a story has a stated goal which it follows. The story can branch off and create other short-term goals, but it doesn't usually sway from the long-term goal when that goal is the main focus. In this case, I thought the long-term goal would be Soma working toward and winning a seat in the Elite Ten, but this goal of Soma's seemed to die out the more time he spent at camp. This isn't necessarily bad as this added a bit of plot-specific filler content to the story, but Soma was so set on winning a place in the Elite Ten it was a let down to see that goal completely forgotten, as if it was mentioned mainly for introducing an interesting plot to keep watchers hooked. Of course, as I mentioned above, it would have been rather predictable given Soma's skill, but at least it was a goal the character had rather than just 24 episodes of cooking, beating someone supposedly more skilled, and moving onto the next person.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the pacing is a bit off. In the beginning it was done all right as characters head to an academy to hone their cooking skills, but the last half of the show involving the Autumn Elections are incredibly drawn out for no reason other than filler.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 6\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here. The art of the food was done very well. However, it was so detailed compared to the characters and everything else it was nearly overdone.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nI'll make this fairly to-the-point. Let's begin with Soma.\\n\\n\r\nSoma: As stated above, from the beginning he's shown as perfect. He's not presented with really any flaw nor backstory, and when he is, it's so much later on it doesn't matter. The purpose of the first few episodes should be exposition which is used in a story to sprinkle in bits and pieces of not only the premise and setting, but also who the characters are and a bit about where they wish to be in life. While Soma is presented a few times with the goal of becoming a better cook, it becomes a rather unnecessary goal when he's already surpassed other apparently brilliant chefs. Also, any flaws or backstory that do appear exist for mere moments. He's a lot like a cooking Naruto; hotheaded and determined. But at least Naruto's hotheadedness got the better of him from time to time and was something he could learn from. With Soma, it's a personality trait that all the tsunderes can't help but adore. So, really, he's more like a cooking Kirito. No flaws, really nothing to learn from besides one rival, his father, not much backstory, and all the ladies love him. Boring.\\n\\n\r\nErina: Not much to say here. She's the bitch with the boobs. Like Soma, she has a bit of backstory, but that's put on the back burner (see what I did there?) in order to show off how truly rich and elegant she is and how much she can't stand Soma. At least she has him as a rival of some sort, but again, there is much development from this rivalry.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi: She probably had the most development out of anyone. She has a bit of backstory that helps her grow as a cook, but unfortunately she relies too heavily on Soma to make her truly develop rather than deciding for herself how and when to grow. \\n\\n\r\nLast, Takumi: Arguably the best character in my opinion. He has a sibling, he has a personality, and he has a flaw, no passion to cook, but even so, he worked toward a goal of learning how to cook. They should have made him the protagonist...or at least kept him in the show. By about episode 10 he's no longer around. He does make a reappearance in the Autumn Elections, but only briefly, so one of the most interesting characters is used for a few moments of rivalry with Soma only to be forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki is not the worst thing I've watched, but certainly not the best. Certainly not worthy of that 8.6 rank. It skips exposition, introducing characters early on only to introduce their backstories and flaws and goals twenty episodes later. It completely cuts out characters with potential. The beginning is well-paced, but boring while the ending is drawn out and also boring. Its protagonist is too perfect while everyone else with potential and personality are used as side characters or boner-producers. Once it does become interesting, it's only for a moment before reverting back to the same formula: Perfect character is unbeatable, who would have guessed. In conclusion, this anime had potential, but didn't expand on it as unfortunately boobs are more important than plot and interesting characters.",

            "content": "I honestly went blind into this anime and had no idea what to expect well except for food. But, my reason for continuing to watch this show was because of I can\u2019t believe I am saying this \u2013 the parts where people become stark naked and have orgasms from the food they eat. Not to mention, that the tentacle porn like scenes also made me question how this show would go down. No kidding!\r\nBut, even though that\u2019s one aspect of this anime that grabbed my attention- but yet it still wasn\u2019t obviously enough for me to consider food wars even as a decent anime atthat point. I thought at most this was going to end up being a guilty pleasure for me- because at first this was show was basically people getting pleasured by food. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, what made me truly love this show was the competition aspect of it. I mean, I find it really interesting at how all the students are pressured to the point of basically wanting to commit suicide over cooking five star meals. Like I mentioned earlier, in this school only 10% of the students make it out alive and they are pushed basically beyond their limits. In this school, it\u2019s basically go big or go home situation for all the characters and it heavily reminded me of competition shows like Hell\u2019s Kitchen or Masterchef- where everyone judging your food is ten times harsher than Gordon Ramsey and Joe Bastianich combined. \\n\\n\r\nAnd just when you think, that the characters have gone through it all- turns out that the hell you thought they were facing was just a prep for the actual hell they are going to face. Any normal person, in their situations would have simply cracked under pressure and would have required major therapy to go on with life. I swear, the challenges are tough and kind of similar to the ones in HunterXHunter just with food.  But, we thank god we have a great cast of characters that manage to shine brightly in whatever challenge they face whether they win or lose.\\n\\n\r\nFirst in line, we have got our main male character Yukihira Sohma the underdog in Totsuki due to the fact unlike others he just worked in a local restaurant. Sohma despite being your average shonen protagonist was very likeable. I loved how confident he was and that he\u2019d face every challenge without breaking a sweat. He also never looked down on his opponents despite being like this and even helped others out too. One issue I had with his character in particular- that it seems that his victory is always guaranteed. Because he is the main character \u2013 not to mention all he seems to is win . But, what saved his character from being a disappointment that he was technically not the best and that he would work hard in improving his craft. He wants to outshine his dad- and he always fails in defeating him- reason why he becomes determined to be the best.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Erina Nakiri, the first main female protagonist of the show and also a potential love interest for Yukihira. And let me just say, that\u2019s it been a while since I have come across an annoying spoiled and bitchy tsundere. For the time being, I hate her guts and I am hoping that would change by the end. What I dislike the most about her character is the fact- she is full of herself and basically considers herself better than others. Everybody in her eyes are meagre peasants while she is the queen. Not to mention, her unfair treatment of Sohma in the second episode pissed the living hell out of me. She is literally the worst girl in the show and possibly one of the worst characters to come out in 2015.\\n\\n\r\nWe now Sohma\u2019s other potential love interest Megumi Tadokoro who is basically the opposite of Sohma and is a breath of fresh air compared to this bitch. She is timid, shy and scared shitless went dealing with a challenge unlike Sohma. Megumi is hands down the most relatable character in the show and I always rooted for her since her introduction in EP3. People think Sohma\u2019s the underdog when truth be told it\u2019s actually Megumi who manages to knock it out of the park with her cooking. But, she does screw up a lot and ends up getting poor grades because of nervous she gets. But, she gets probably the most character development and does her best to conquer her fears and prove to everyone that she does indeed belong here. \\n\\n\r\nI especially loved the bond she had with Sohma and they suit each other perfectly because of how their personalities contrast with one another. Sohma basically gives her the push she needs and helps her realize that she should cook while being calm and having fun in the process. I also love how much Sohma cares for Megumi and almost gets expelled in the middle of the show for her sake. Megumi thanks to Sohma, ends up improving a tonne and starts believing in herself more. That\u2019s why I ship these two like crazy and I swear if the mangaka makes Erina end up with Sohma then I will kill a bitch. Cause sweet and caring Megumi honestly deserves it more than this childish princess. Also, we don\u2019t want Food Wars to have a tragic ending by making Sohma end up dealing with the atrocity that is Erina Nakiri.\\n\\n\r\nI also loved yes Sohma\u2019s third potential love interest Mito Ikumi, Erina\u2019s cousin Alice (who is awesome unlike her), the Aldini brothers, Akira, Erina\u2019s assistant Hisako and they were all surprisingly given a fair amount of character development. It was a really clever idea to showcase the characters backstory when they present their food while nervously awaiting the judgment. It hence makes us worry for them even more. I honestly love all the characters in the show due to their over the top and unique personalities, with the exception of Erina Nakiri of course- which is obvious given how much I ranted about her earlier on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFood Wars however did not only give importance to the characters but also to the food which was obviously necessary. But, instead of just exploring Japanese cuisine they also dived into others like Italian, Indian, and Chinese etc. which I truly appreciate. They also didn\u2019t spew out anything complicated for us to understand but by the end we were thoroughly impressed at their knowledge of food- which is the key in cooking. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Food Wars was done by JC Staff- who I am a fan of. And even though JC staff have put out better looking shows in the past they still did a great a job with this one. They especially exceuted the food tasting scenes where the characters do that thing exceptionally well not to mention they made the food look good enough to make your mouth water. Hence, making Food Wars a terrible anime to watch during Ramadan for Muslims or basically anytime you are hungry. That\u2019s why I recommend you eat while you watch this show. \\n\\n\r\nI love both the first OP and especially the ED for Food Wars and I consider them better than the second ones - and I wish they didn\u2019t get replaced in the second half. \\n\\n\r\nAs for flaws of this show I would say that it takes about five episodes to get really good. Its when all the characters are properly introduced is when the show starts getting better. Also, after something as epic as a the arc dealing with the students at that camp- the karage arc felt very underwhelming to me. Thank god it only last two episodes because I got scared thinking that Food Wars would go downhill beyond that point. But thank god, it didn\u2019t it just got better and better!\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, what makes Shokugeki No Soma great are the characters, the challenges they face and the facts of food that are presented to us. The orgasming to food part is just a bonus and I hate how people are simply basing their opinion on the show simply based on that aspect. I know I also judged the show due that same reason at first- but it was easy to look past it given all the other stuff it offered me. The main reason, I guess I made this review is to fully inform those who think Foods Wars is basically unique form of fanservice that it\u2019s a show definitely worth not looking down upon. If you still didn\u2019t like Food Wars then I guess that\u2019s your problem!\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I would love to award Food Wars with an 10 for being addictive and interesting as hell- I have to give it a 9 because about seven episodes were underwhelming and not on the same level of brilliance as the rest. But, none the less Food Wars is a MUST WATCH show but avoid it at all costs if you are a Muslim fasting during Ramadan!\\n",

I knew it was about food and I'd seen pictures on various social media of the food that comes from this series\u2014it's beautiful! There hasn't been very many anime that centers around food so it piqued my interest.\r\nWhile Food Wars is definitely surprising\u2014shocking, even\u2014I was extremely disappointed to find that it has no plot, no interesting characters, character development was nonexistent, and it's just an overwhelming amount of gross ecchi-ahegaoman-service. Within the first 5 minutes of the pilot episode, the viewers had the misfortune of watching an underage child orgasm from eating food the red-haired kid (whose name escapes me; he's not interesting enough to remember) and suddenly get attacked and sexually violated by an octopus...all because the redhead made an octopus dish. I felt my brain liquefy from the stupendous amount of absurdity. I like my anime with a lot more meat on their bones and not just pretty animation of food.",

            "content": "Before watching Shokugeki, I did not know how to cook. After watching Shokugeki, I don\u2019t know shit about food at all.\r\nFood so real, you\u2019re going to cry - Shokugeki no Souma review\r\nThe story begins with a cooking face off between Yukihira Souma and his father, Yukihira Joichiro. Ever since Souma began cooking, he has always wanted to surpass his father and take the mantle of the head chef of their family restaurant. Souma is 15 and his father has enrolled him into Totsuki academy, the top culinary school in Japan, in order to expand his cooking skills and experience a whole new world of cooking.Now that is what a shounen is. Once he enters Totsuki, during the opening ceremony he makes his dominance palpable to everyone, asserting his confidence that he will not lose to anyone until he defeats his father.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with such an already fantastic start, we\u2019re given great direction and writing to feel what shounen is again, or rather a damn near perfect show. Right at the first few episodes, we\u2019re already introduced to the big shots of the culinary world, each with their own unique tastes and personality. It accomplishes a foreboding atmosphere expressing the skills and craft of those who fight for hegemony of the culinary world. Now that is bad ass. Immediately Souma is engaged in an early battle against one of them, and I think anyone can assume what will happen.\\n\\n\r\nSince the early days his cooking career began, Souma had always lost to his father, fermenting his skills and experience through loss, especially against one who was once one of the top at Totsuki. From here we learn that our main character isn\u2019t just some cocky and overrated dude. He has legitimate scores to boot what he barks when in face of his peers. Tadokoro Megumi is a shy and feint hearted girl who had yet to break her through her prisoning shell. But through the help of Souma\u2019s advisory and charisma, she is able to bring out her true self and show to the world she isn\u2019t just some useless girl who got lucky in enrolling Totsuki. Nakiri Erina being just about as cocky as Souma isn\u2019t developed as much as our other characters, but slowly with each episode opens to an insight of who Yukihira really is, even though it is situational irony that us the audience already know. However it doesn\u2019t hinder the story one bit. Everyone of the other cast members are given enough time to develop in their own small ways and improve however more enhanced by the dialogue given by spectators, as well as being charismatic in their own right.\\n\\n\r\nDialogue and direction of the show is done excellently. For a show that is about cooking, we actually are given enough details to know what ingredients are used in the food and how it is cooked. Each episode we\u2019re introduced to fantastic new dishes from a variety of different cultures from around the world. Not one moment is there overlapping food choices as we are shown food types and ways of cooking normal people outside of the culinary world would never have thought of before. It\u2019s inspiring and does its job of making us hungry, if you know what I mean ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). Being seriously, it does make you want to eat prior to watching the show.The narrative Shokugeki tells is compelling in the contained story that is it. It is kept small but so varied that not one moment felt dull.\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki proves a worthy contender in all categories of art, animation, and sound. The food looks better than anything I\u2019ve seen in real life, I could almost eat it from my screen. Animation is beautifully done. Blended with the art it aspires itself to go beyond each new episode every week, furthering what else it can accomplish. The voice acting and bgms enhance the experience to a whole new level. At first the foodgasms may be a turnoff for the fear of it being overused and pushed into your face just to put out sexual content, it surprisingly handles it maturely at times when it is needed. And it offers comedy in many of those moments as well, like as if the food was so great that Souma literally punched a judge in the face. Openings were alright to me, with the first ending being my favorite of the songs. With all three elements combined, it offers a surrounding greatness to it.\\n\\n\r\nWith all said and done, I think it\u2019s time I gave Shokugeki no Souma a high score of 9/10 with a fucking fantastic seal of approval. There are many terrible shows that came out in 2015, but Shokugeki proves that there are still shows out there with great writing and stand the test of time. And it is a show that I can recommend with no doubt. It is for sure that this show is one I will use to measure in those of its genre. Now then, I\u2019m off to write my next review.",

This is a work of art! The characters' personalities all work off each other, with each one having a backstory (that isn't too in-depth, I hate long and boring backstories) that helps develop the character. Oh yeah, and there is:\r\n-Cooking!\r\n-Learning how to cook!\r\n-Cutting with different types of knives!\r\n-And cooking speeches so awesome that Kamina would say them if he were achef!\\n\r\nSometimes, the staleness is so cliche that it is funny, too!\\n\r\nI love waiting to see how the next person will react to Yukihira's food. He is like the Kirito of the cooking world!\\n\r\nI love the story, full of cookingness\\n\r\nArtwork includes detailed artwork of food!

You might end up hungry after watching every episodes.  Souma (MC) isn't the main source of comedy here, he's not even a wacky character like luffy. He's a smooth operator, i like that his character was already built as a good cook from the start, though still lacking of experience. Unlike other anime with MC having good potential but fundamentally zero background/basics about their stuff.  Most ofthe Enjoyment here came from the situations like whenever they ridiculously react after they tasted the dish, some are awkward because of the ecchi scenes. Even some of the casual conversations are funny enough. You will eventually know why its really called FOOD WARS on its later episodes, don't wanna spoil but just think of the tv show \"iron chef.\"\\n\\n\r\n    Just take the story as it is, enjoy and don't expect something dark or depth on it. Its about Yukihira souma trained to cook by his father since childhood. They own a diner but souma's old-man closed it to work abroad and to fund his education in totsuki academy, where the culinary adventure starts.  \\n\\n\r\n    Art and sound are great! watch it on HD and you will appreciate it more.  Food appearances may not be detailed or realistic all the time which is not really an issue unless you are keen about details or seeing the ingredients on its realistic art.  Of course this show will also teach you cooking but don't expect to learn some advance techniques, even though they explained how the dishes were made. Its hilarious from ep. 1 to 24 but on a serious note, characters here are all aiming to improve their crafts, and achieve their personal goals.  \\n\\n\r\ni might not attempt to read the manga, so it will not spoil the 2nd season when i watch it. cheers!\\n",

But is it any good or is it just another one of those popular but dull anime, that I will discuss in this review. \r\nStory - 8/10\r\nFrom the synopsis itself, you must have realized that the anime revolves around Soma Yukihira who wants to become a cook and surpass his father in cooking. Some stuff happens and Somaends up in Totsuki Academy, which is the best cooking school in Japan. After all this, you must have come to the conclusion that it isn't unique or special, but that doesn't make it bad. The story isn't anything even special to start off with but the other aspects of the show are so well done that it makes you feel that the story is better than it actually is. Not to say that the story's bad, by any means, it's pretty good but this is not a story-driven anime, it's character-driven.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the show, to be described in one word, is brilliant. While one can say that almost all anime that are released these days have really good animation quality, Shokugeki no Soma's animation is a level above most others. (while not being as good as something made by ufotable but its still very detailed and fluent). The best thing about Food Wars's art is the way they display food, it's just really awesome. The animation is consistent throughout the show and doesn't get bad at any moment. The openings and ending too are animated nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs, are, for the most part, unique as well, with most characters having different features. However, one can argue that Erina Nakiri(one of the female protagonists) looks pretty darn similar to Asuna Yuuki from SAO. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9.5/10\\n\r\nThe first opening is amazing; it a treat to the ears. It's simply beautiful. I am not too good at Japanese so I don't read the lyrics but just listening to the opening psyches you up for the episode. The ending is pretty good too but it still pales in comparison to the opening. (Says how excellent the opening song is). The second opening is good, but it's more of an opening for a fighting/action anime. The first opening was very charming and pleasant, which suits the theme of Shokugeki no Soma. However, the second OP's tone didn't quite suit it, in my opinion. It can be called pretty decent, nonetheless. The second ending is very good to hear too. (And they used the first OP at the end of the final episode 24 of the anime so that means it was the best of the series)\\n\r\nNow, on to the soundtrack, in my opinion, they lack a couple of battle soundtracks which they could use during shokugekis and stuff. There is only one track which played is over and over again, during food battles or while the characters are cooking something for their tests among other stuff. The track named Shokugeki no Soma Epic soundtrack(so much for a good title) on its own is thrilling to hear and you won't probably notice how repetitive it is unless you are watching like 8-9 episodes at once. But if you do watch a few  episodes at once, there is a chance that you will come to complaint about the limited tracks. The limited amount of soundtrack is the only critic I could have in the sound department. The voice acting is funny when required, serious and tension-building during a shokugeki, which is also another plus to the anime. Simply put, the voice acting is almost flawless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe cast in this anime is pretty big, which you would expect from a shounen+school anime like this. There are rivals, friends, upperclassmen, etc but most of the relevant characters have gotten pretty good screentime to express their characters.\\n\\n\r\nOur lovely protagonist, Soma Yukihira is just awesome. He can be OP sometimes with his dishes but he is awesome, nonetheless. He is and is not your typical shounen protagonist. When I say he is your typical shounen protag, I look into the fact that he has a goal of surpassing someone, he is pretty determined to do that, etc. When I say he isn't, the unique features of his characters come out : his confidence, his competence in stuff he does, his arrogance(at times). Now, here his arrogance does a great job because it's really fun to see the opponent's reactions after they are brought down by his words. However, most importantly, he entertains us. For an anime like Food Wars, he is the perfect protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThe two main female characters of the show are damn good :\\n\r\nMegumi Tadokoro is your usual clumsy, scared girl from a small village who hopes of making it big here. While there is nothing much unique about her character, she has done her job well so far and is getting development and she does get braver as the anime progresses.\\n\r\nErina Nakiri is the tsundere who is also known as \"God Tongue\" because of her ability to only acknowledge the best of foods. She is the daughter of the Director(or something big shot of Totsuki at least.) and her family is one of leads in culinary restaurants and other stuff in the world. She is prideful, arrogant and would destroy anything that could stand in her way of being no. 1 in Totsuki; anyone other than Soma. Erina hates Soma and you'll understand why she does after watching the first couple of episodes. The interactions between Soma and Erina are fun to watch, really fun to watch. Although, this season isn't focussed on Erina too much, I am sure she will be getting her time in this coming seasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe remaining characters, too, as I said, are entertaining to watch. Some of their interactions are hilarious while some will show you the intensity of the battles happening in Food Wars.\\n\\n\r\nPros :\\n\\n\r\n1. Extremely entertaining.\\n\r\n2. Amazing comedy and you'll jump out of your seat while watching some of them. \\n\r\n3. Great animation and soundtrack.\\n\r\n4. Immensely amusing character interactions.\\n\\n\r\nCons :\\n\\n\r\nComedy can get out of hand sometimes with the ecchi. If you aren't a fan of ecchi, you might not like the characters' reactions after they eat the food. They get naked and act and act like they're having orgasms. A lot of people have enjoyed this but some might not. However, the good thing is that these get less and less as the anime progresses and by around episode 8, these foodgasms are reduced since the anime starts to get more serious and take off to the skies.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime is a hell of a ride and the entertainment value of the show is right up there. The first episode is nothing compared to what the next few episodes bring to you. The thing got better and better with each passing episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9.5/10 \\n\r\nIn my opinion, Shokugeki no Soma is the best anime released in the year 2015. I guess, the stats it has on MAL speaks for itself.\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this anime to you, even if you are not a fan of such anime, it's worth your time and I am almost certain that you won't regret watching it.\\n",

            "content": "Sorry everyone, I honestly don't know why this show is so highly ranked as it is.\r\nShokugeki no Souma is a train wreck. And when I say this I don't say it lightly - what started out glowing with great potential came crashing and burning once the show got a little over half-way into the season.\r\nThe biggest and most saddening part of Shokugeki is the very poor (or lack of) character development. By throwing way too many characters into the mix, there is simply not enough screen time for most of the main characters. The only person who I would argue went under the most significantchange was Megumi, and even so, her development was incredibly forced - her development was not so much based on her own sheer free will but rather because she wanted to mimic other individuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe other disappointing factor about Shokugeki is the over-stretching (if this is even a word, lol) of the plot towards the latter half of the season. This is especially exemplified by the Autumn Elections. Most of the tournament events could have been condensed into two to four episodes, but since the judges kept talking and basically giving the same, predictable reviews and reactions (\"oh this doesn't look good... but it's so yummy! *insert overly used ecchi animation*), this was easily dragged on and on when it didn't have to be.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does Shokugeki get right? Arguably the humor. The humor is quick, witty, and light and never fails to disappoint. The artwork and sound is also decent, albeit the ecchi animations are way too overused.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Humorous\\n\r\n- Interesting characters, although some were clearly drawn from stereotypical personalities\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Poor plot execution, especially towards the second half of the season\\n\r\n- Poor character development\\n\r\n- Predictable\\n\r\n- Overuse of ecchi scenes - as the saying goes, the same jokes get old fast...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma also goes by the name, Food Wars. However, I\u2019d like to call it more as Food Gasm. The reason being is that the character reactions to food is not what you may expect. Or maybe you will once you see how ridiculously delicious the food actually is. What this show brings forth to the table is more than just a delicious meal though. Shokugeki no Souma is a satirical battle shounen that emphasizes more than just cooking. \r\nBased on the popular manga written by Yuto Tsukuda, the series is adapted into a 2 cour (24 episodes) of the same name. What startedoff as a one-shot has now transformed into this series that essentially makes food look like an exotic beauty. And it all starts with a young boy named Souma Yukihara. Like many young people, he has a dream and in this case, to become a professional chef. In fact, he actually hope to surpass his father and to do that, enlists at an elite culinary school. More precisely known as Totsuki Culinary Academy, it\u2019s here where Souma finds his true challenge and misadventures.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be honest here. This show feels like a classic. And although it doesn\u2019t involve any super powers like some other battle shounen series, Shokugeki no Souma does carry on with similar elements. The main course of the show consists of Souma\u2019s progress at the academy and proving himself as a candidate to becoming a professional chef. Throughout the journey, we also witness him build meaningful relationships with others ranging from friendship and rivalries. The first few episodes clearly establishes that Souma has a strong degree of confidence in his own abilities. His skill is shown first hand when he cooks a meal to overly satisfy Yaeko Minegasaki, an urban life planner who initially threatened to demolish the restaurant he worked at. It\u2019s here where the audience gets a taste of what the show tries appeal through the sexual metaphors and sensation of tasting food. It doesn\u2019t take long for the show to take Soma to a place where he faces off against powerful adversaries including high level chef, Erina Nakiri. \\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma accomplishes with entertainment not just by the storytelling but also through its characters. It has a colorful cast with a diverse range of personalities. From the prideful Erina Nakiri to shy Megumi Tadokoro, we see how their roles are played out through the series. What\u2019s most important is how they interact with others especially in the case of Souma. Because this way, it brings out the best and worst of characters. For Erina, she brings sheer antagonism and rivalry that against Souma. From the first moment they meet, there\u2019s a seemingly bitterness between them. Although Souma takes it more casually, it\u2019s Erina that acts arrogant because of her status and ability. On the other hand, there\u2019s Megumi who is more like the antithesis of Erina. Although she has decent skills of the culinary arts, there\u2019s a lack of confidence in her abilities. Thankfully, Souma slowly brings out her confidence throughout the show. Her partnership with Souma not only bring up Megumi\u2019s confidence but also shows that she does have a place to belong at Totsuki Culinary Academy. At the apex of the mid-season, we see exactly how much she improves herself through experience, confidence, and a willingness to succeed. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, there are many other characters that Soma meets along the way while at the academy. The staff members in particular have shown a particular interest in him such as Kojiro Shinomiya, Fumio Daimido, Senzemon Nakiri, and among others. This establishes the fact that Souma begins to earn the respect that he seemingly deserves. Throughout the show, we also see other characters that challenges him to disapprove of his ego. And this is also sometimes a fault for Souma. While he isn\u2019t overly arrogant, Soma displays a bit of overconfidence when he faces off against certain rivals. This occasionally doesn\u2019t work out as Soma does feels a taste of bitter defeat. The primary example is perhaps with his father as he has a long losing streak against him. Still, a good amount of focus on Souma can also be emphasized on his willingness to help others such as Megumi. He wants others to succeed and seeing them do so motivates himself to make his dream into a reality. At the best of his character, Souma demonstrates superior sportsmanship that deserves utmost respect.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show about culinary arts, you\u2019d all expect a lot of the food cooked in the show to be an eye candy. After all, food is like art that can be treated as beautiful. What the show emphasizes perhaps is a bit of over exaggeration on the reaction when the food is eaten. Just a warning but you\u2019re not a fan of sexual metaphor and satire, then this may not be a show for you. It\u2019s clearly shown that the characters\u2019 reactions can sometimes go overboard. The sheer effort put into the imaginations of the characters upon digesting the food is highly sensational with eroticism. While it isn\u2019t full on nudity, it does satires the food to a point where it becomes naughty. However, I would say that the reaction is appropriate in the case of this series for several reasons. First, it makes the craftsmanship of the various food products into a wonder. It tells (through the explanations of making the food), shows (with carefully crafted visuals), and then reacts with a way that you can expect the food to be. From the moment the first ingredient is set on the table to the last gulp of food down the throat, each episode carefully articulates the way the food is handled. And that is something to really think about. Plus, the show itself also does a neat job with the working mechanics. We get the making of various food dishes explained well through visuals, symbolism, and metaphors. There\u2019s also well timed comedy to make the process less dull. I mean, no one wants to watch every food making process like an instruction manual right?\\n\\n\r\nDespite the series being well done on most respects, it tries perhaps too much on its food war mechanics. Sometimes, it almost feels like the show is advertising itself like a sexualized commercial. There\u2019s good amount of characterization in the series but some of the side characters may easily be forgotten once you finish the show. Plus, the characters you may remember may not be of your taste. These may include Erina whose attitude can almost feel intolerable to get accustomed to. Megumi\u2019s shy behavior also isn\u2019t a strong trait. Even Souma has faults too when he shows weakness. Also, don\u2019t expect romance to develop much in this series. The show is not about Souma finding love but for him to find out if he is truly able to become a professional chef and surpass his father. Finally, the show does omit some parts of the manga. Overall though, it\u2019s still faithful for the fans of the manga that long awaited for the adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nEssentially, I wasn\u2019t sure which studio would handle this series\u2019 artwork. At first, Madhouse and Production I.G. came to mind with their quality. However, J.C. Staff became the engine to make this show\u2019s artwork running. And to be quite frank, it\u2019s fabulously well done. The character designs gives characters unique appearances that makes the most prominent ones stand out. This is especially true for the main leads. Erina is perhaps the girl that stands out the most because of her elegant ouju-sama like presence. Souma also attracts attention as well with his fiery hair that matches with his personality. The school and staff uniforms aren\u2019t designed to look decorate but rather to show their status at the school, as it should be. However, what really stands out about the artwork and visual of the series is the food. They look extravagantly well crafted. Combining elements of delusional fantasy and sensational appeal, each episode highly emphasizes on their design. And of course, do expect fan service as result of the reactions. Outside of the foodgasm, there is also fan service with the characters \u2013 both male and female. These include the eyebrow rising camera angles, alluring clothes of some of the female characters, and in general, something to really service the fans. \\n\\n\r\nIn general, soundtrack is well done although not regarded as a prominent feature of the series. There are two OP/ED theme songs with a decent amount of focus on its coordination. It\u2019s not a technical genius as there\u2019s not much more to draw from the songs themselves besides some of the obvious fan service, symbolism, and foreshadowing. However, the OST delivers a good momentum that carries on each episode. This is especially highlighted during moments when food wars are initiated by certain characters. The thrilling moments of the soundtrack serves up to what the audience anticipates and ultimately makes the show connect itself. The voice mannerism can be a hit or miss although mostly adapts well for characters like Souma with his confidence or Megumi with her increasing confidence level. But you know what really catches the attention of the viewer? Probably the moans and reactions again from tasting the food. It\u2019s not just \u201coh this is delicious!\u201d but more like the moans you hear when someone is having a lot \u201cfun\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time you started or finish this show, you may look at food in a different way than before. As a show that adapts battle shounen with food dishes, Shokugeki no Souma offers a glorious feast to the eye and ear. This is a tasty tale about a guy who cooks not just to show off but to make others happy. And while he is at it, his dream of becoming a professional chef is a journey that\u2019s hard to take eyes off of. I have to also mention that the character cast offers a little of almost everything to the audience. The food itself is irresistible when it comes to the way each episode handles itself. The series may be animated but the sensational feel is a majestic beauty. Sure, it does over exaggerates itself at times. However at the end of the day, it will reach a level of experience that you want to see over and over again.\\n",

            "content": "Imagine that you have a typical tournament-based battle shounen. Now replace the fighting... with food porn. The result is basically Shokugeki no Souma.\r\nThe story takes place at an elite culinary school called T\u014dtsuki Academy; a place so competitive that only about 10% of its students are estimated to ever graduate from it. Enter Yukihira Souma: a confident 15-year-old boy who dreams of becoming a full-time chef at his father's restaurant. In order to do so, Souma enrolls in the prestigious school and has to go through all the ruthless challenges it has to offer as he seeks to slowly but surely climb his way tothe top.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime follows Souma and the other students as they have to accomplish various difficult cooking assignments and challenges under very strict teachers, as well as compete against one another. This is primarily done through a dueling system called the Shokugeki: an official cook-off judged by an unbiased jury which is used as a means to settle debates and disagreements. During a Shokugeki, each competing side must prematurely wager something which is deemed to be of equal value, and they're both obliged to honor their part of the bargain should they be the one to lose the match. In this way, the students can use their cooking skills alone to \"fight\" each other.\\n\\n\r\nSo what exactly is it that makes this anime so good then? Well simply put, Shokugeki no Souma is incredibly entertaining. It is addictive, somewhat original and it keeps making you giggle to yourself at the never-ending foodgasms. Now if you don't know what a foodgasm is, it's basically the orgasm-like reaction a character has when eating something so delicious that they're unable to contain their excitement, and this anime has plenty of that. So yes, there are a lot of ecchi moments, but it somehow fits the show *perfectly*. I don't even know why it's so much fun to watch, but it just is. These reactions are very creative, generally connected to the food in question in some way, and beautifully illustrated accordingly. I might also add that the series' illustrator is originally a hentai mangaka, so it's not really that strange that the eroticism is so on point.\\n\\n\r\nAs a protagonist, Souma is extremely cocky, but also very charismatic. He's the kind of character which you like to cheer for and want to win, which in a competitive story is a pretty big deal. Other characters include the clumsy but kindhearted Megumi, the condescending tsundere Erina who has unparalleled taste buds, the meat-obsessed Nikumi and countless more. As a whole, the character cast is very balanced and diverse, which also results in very different kinds of cooking.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the culinary aspect is pretty interesting in and of itself. If you're interested in trying out some new recipes for yourself, then Shokugeki no Souma has plenty of inspiration for you. The sheer amount of creativity poured into the various exotic dishes in this anime is not to be underestimated. I haven't really tried cooking anything new that I've seen in this show myself as of yet, but there are certainly a handful of things I'd love to try someday.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end, regardless of whether you're primarily watching Shokugeki no Souma for the foodgasms, the cooking or the intense competition, you're probably not going to be left disappointed because the anime does a great job on all three fronts. There's also the fact that this is an almost perfect adaptation of the manga, so even hardcore fans of the source material should most likely be satisfied with it.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, given the huge tease of a cliffhanger ending, we're all going to have to be impatiently rolling our thumbs in eager anticipation for the fateful day when season 2 (hopefully) comes around.",

            "content": "One positive thing I can say about Shokugeki no Souma is that it's an anime that knows exactly what it is - a ridiculously over-the-top sports/battle shounen with cooking as the centerpiece.\r\nIn the beginning, the plot seems familiar, but inviting - our hero Souma is faced with his first opponent - an aggressive businesswoman looking to put his father's humble diner out of commission to make way for her development plans.  We all know she's simply a stepping stone into the universe of this anime. Predictably, she agrees to step down if Souma can impress her with his cooking. And, of course, he defeatsher with relative ease.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an amusing start, and you know there's a much larger story and far more formidable opponents on the road ahead. Unfortunately from here on out, Shokugeki no Souma slowly stumbles into mediocrity as it attempts to constantly out-do itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual gags in SnS are the primary source of its \"ecchi\" tag, which mostly consist of its infamous food-induced orgasms, complete with clothes being torn asunder and physics-defying breasts superimposed on dreamy foodscapes. Funny the first time, but it gets old fast.\\n\\n\r\nThough these scenes don't exist simply for humor, but also to beat you over the head with expository dialogue as to why the dish they're eating is just that good. Imagine your typical anime action battle scene -  a combatant suddenly realizes their opponent's \"secret technique\", and inexplicably begins to blab out loud what is happening, as if they knew we were watching.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is SnS in a nutshell - every shounen trope you can imagine, but with food. This by itself isn't inherently bad, it's simply what it does with them that makes SnS very predictable, tiresome and - despite pulling out all the stops to be as epic as possible - ultimately boring.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story of SnS plays it relatively safe. We are all familiar with the archetype of the unexpected hero and his hometown roots. He's young, highly competitive and determined - albeit a bit naive and a sore loser. Trained under his mysterious and skilled father, he sends him off to a prestigious academy for aspiring chefs. Surrounded by peers of elite and privileged upbringing, he sticks out like a sore thumb - something that sometimes comes to his advantage. It is here Souma will face one greater challenge after another as he fights for the chance to be the very best that no one ever was.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a tried and true classic plotline. It can be inspiring, motivational and relatable in all kinds of ways. It's meant to resonate with the average viewer, and that's great! But there's little reason to be invested in - even if the stakes are high - if we don't care about the characters. Unfortunately, SnS fails in many ways to create compelling characters.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOne glaring issue with SnS is that the main character is almost too perfect. Souma is basically a \"Marty Stu\", or an idealized self-insert that just so happens to excel at everything he does. He seems incapable of doing wrong, making mistakes or showing weakness. Women fawn over him, think about him constantly and even spite eachother in order to win his affection, though he seems blissfully unaware or uninterested in any of it.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Souma is capable of learning things and growing as a person, we don't ever really see it happen - we only see the results of it. And sometimes it happens literally overnight. \\n\\n\r\nSouma's flaws are merely personality quirks, nothing really stops him from reaching the next plateau. His struggle is almost non-existent because of this, and it rarely adds any tension or excitement to his story.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, there are far too many supporting characters that overlap eachother. In 2 cours of SnS we are introduced to over two dozen supporting cast with some kind of backstory and motivation - mostly sharing at least two of the following attributes: 1. the desire to be the best in the academy 2. obsessively competitive and self-righteous 3. the desire to best Souma as a chef - and, as an added bonus, may possibly have some kind of unrequited affection towards him. Granted, not all supporting cast follow this example (for example, the far more compelling and likable Miyoko Houjou), but there are few and they get painfully  little screen time.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, a lot of the supporting cast is generally flat and unlikable outside of Souma's dorm mates. True that many are merely rivals, but this doesn't mean that the character can't be complex and interesting. Sometimes the rivals and villains of a story can be even more compelling than the characters we're supposed to be cheering on.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character that comes from truly humble beginnings and experiences real growth is the female lead Megumi. Her flaws are human, her character is believable, and her struggle is familiar on many levels. Souma is so sickeningly idealized that it makes Megumi stand out even more, and it's hard not to cheer her on. However, with so many other characters competing for screen-time, she is sometimes absent. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nSnS is constantly trying to reach new heights of epic showdowns with the same set-up in every arc. It goes something like this - a new character or characters are introduced, Souma encounters them, and they appear in the next \"cooking battle\". There's monologues, wide-eyed moments of revelation, montages and of course ecchi. They all generally end the same way, though - with Souma edging his way to the next challenge and stunning his seasoned rivals. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem lies in that literally every cooking battle ends in the same way - those judging the food are seen as jaded and impossible to impress. Yet that illusion is instantly shattered as Souma and his peers unexpectedly blow them away every time to the shock of onlookers. But when the audience is shown this over and over from the get-go, it's anything but shocking and the tension is artificial.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time you get to the 6-episode cooking battle finale, you already know exactly what's going to happen. Watching it unfold is hilariously predictable and the whole arc falls flat. There's not much of a resolution either as the manga is ongoing, so the ending feels more like a lull than anything.\\n\\n\r\nOne positive thing to say about the enjoyment factor is that the pacing of SnS is fairly well done. Many anime struggle with pacing, but SnS manages to pack in a lot without seeming rushed or taking too much time here or there. Unfortunately what's happening on screen is not awfully compelling.\\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here besides \"good\". This is by no means an animated masterpiece, but the animation is generally solid and consistent. The art style is also aesthetically pleasing. The only complaint regarding the animation are the sometimes poorly animated bouncing breasts - if you're going to do blatant fanservice, at least do it right. At times the breasts bounce as if they were being flopped around in an exaggerated video game physics engine with no rhyme or reason. Also, the art can sometimes go overboard on the blush with soft red gradients topped with white highlights all over the body. They look like awkwardly large pimples when they're not done subtly.\\n\\n\r\nThe paintings and animation of food are nothing short of stellar. You won't see food this detailed in many other anime. But at the end of the day it is just food and doesn't do much for what's happening in the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is well done and the sound effects will make you hungry (if the food on screen isn't already). \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, despite its many flaws, there are much worse anime than SnS. In this case, it's the cast of SnS that drag down a story and premise that had potential, and the result is something decidedly mediocre. While SnS never loses its focus, it shows all the cards in its hand too quickly, leaving the audience with no surprises left to look forward to.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nWhen I was a kid, I was one of the pickiest eaters known to man. My diet consisted of essentially three edibles: cheese sandwiches, yogurt, and liquids. A cheese sandwich is exactly that: two pieces of cheese resting between two slices of white bread (it had to be white bread). The yogurt was devoid of seeds and covered in sprinkles (it had to have sprinkles). As for the liquids, I stuck mostly to Coca-Cola because it was sugary, sweet, and caffeinated which, considering everything else, was probably providing me the most nutrition.\r\nI did not eat hamburgersor turkey. I loathed fruits and vegetables. I rarely tried new foods, and even when I did, my first reaction was always to spit them out. Birthday parties forced my mother to create sack lunches for me so that I would have something to eat in case all that was served at the barbeque was hotdogs.\\n\\n\r\nThis continued for many years of my life, my daily cheese, sprinkles, and carbonated drinks the only foods my body knew. Until, one day, we pulled through a McDonald\u2019s. I was distraught since literally nothing on the menu was \u201cfor me.\u201d My mother suggested the chicken nuggets. I was mortified. No way, I thought. If I eat those, I know it will taste like pavement. I have never tasted the side of the road before, but my brain locked in on that being the only outcome. Still, my mother ordered the meal and I, rather reluctantly, took a bite.\\n\\n\r\nAt that exact moment, my mind unlocked. It was good. Really good. And from then on, I actually started to eat things. Cheeseburgers and roasted turkey were just the beginning. Tacos, spaghetti, pepperoni pizza were now available, and to this day I have no idea how I did not die from malnutrition.\\n\\n\r\nSo while watching Shokugeki no Souma, I thanked the stars that I had a deep-fried piece of chicken meat those many years ago because otherwise I would not have been able to fully engross myself in the delectable food presented by this equally delectable anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma\u2019s narrative is a refrigerator that works only half the time. When the fridge is on, the contents within are just as they should be: hyped, diverse, and silly, making leftovers fun to munch on. When the fridge is not on, the contents begin to rot, its weak themes and dramatic scenes stinking up the place. The anime never tries to fix its refrigerator, so the outcome is a mixture that is not always easily swallowed.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the figurative meat of Shokugeki no Souma? The narrative consists of essentially four courses: breakfast, lunch, a light snack, and dinner. More specifically, the opening festivities, the training camp arc, the \u201ckaraage\u201d arc, and the so-called Autumn Elections. The purpose of segmenting the plot in this way is the first sign of the anime\u2019s main mantra: hype it up. At all moments and at all points, the show is looking to build on its previous outing, one-upping what it did to entice the audience like a freshly baked loaf of bread. It starts normal, introducing the audience to the main cast of characters and how the \u201cShokugeki\u201d battles proceed. Here, simple tactics such as Souma declaring his superiority and a nighttime taste test against one of the ten leaders plant the seeds of hype from the get-go. Then the plot improves on itself, where the training camp technically expels Megumi and Souma has an omelet disaster during a buffet challenge. Interestingly it tones down slightly, the chicken arc seguing the main plotline to give the viewer a bit of breathing room before the Autumn Elections. When they arrive, the oven\u2019s temperature skyrockets, the intensity almost unbearable from the rapid-fire foodstuffs. Tiny details like the judges failing everyone but the main cast and huge details like having the competitors compete in contrasting carnage \u2013 Nao versus Hisako, Aldini versus Aldini, Souma versus Hayama, and so on \u2013 make it so that the tension and therefore the hype never falters. The show never stops trying to outdo itself, giving it that feel of ramping excitement that comes from stuffing one\u2019s face on an empty stomach.\\n\\n\r\nAs it is with microwaves, Shokugeki no Souma also heats up on the micro scale. This is an anime about food. Food is a mundane subject, a natural and indeed necessary part of life. Meaning that the topic is inherently not exciting. Food can certainly be this way, but the majority of people stick to regular meals of sandwiches and salads. Food is also not normally erotic, calories and fat more nutritional than sexual. Again, foods like that exist: chocolate, whip cream, and strawberries immediately come to the forefront of anyone\u2019s mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime focuses on this whole spectrum of food but with a twist. A giant monk fish here, a crunchy coating there, and peanut-butter-covered squid tentacles just for good measure. The anime takes both the common and the outlandish dishes and turns them into a sensual experience that affects not just the taste buds, but the body, mind, and soul. The show is never content with simply showing the food. No, the anime goes into ingredient-level details, spouting accurate yet useless information about the foods being presented. Useless in the sense that the facts are dry and unimportant to the audience. However, it takes these facts, puts them in a kettle to warm, simmer, and eventually boil over. By the end of each longwinded dissection, the food is not just a rainbow terrine or a cooked lobster but rather an adventure through fairytales and outer space that make the viewer feel as if the world is their oyster.\\n\\n\r\nAt times, the anime can get sentimental with specific scenarios \u2013 like the Aldini brothers\u2019 disparity or Megumi\u2019s struggles \u2013 but when these events are preceded or followed with magical girl caricatures or lewd happenings, it defeats the sincerity of these events. Worse still, these moments distract from the aforementioned hype, comedy, and sex, detracting from what the anime does so well to make room for what the anime does not-so-well. To be fair, the show is trying to provide a well-rounded tale. But since it is at the expense of its best material, it only hampers where it should help.\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma therefore sticks mostly to the same recipe: a new challenge is given, food is made, and ridiculous reactions are had. Such repetition is not automatically an issue since the show incorporates variety as much as possible to spice up its innards. Food selections, character combinations, and ever-expanding events keep the show surprisingly fresh since the scrambling and ballooning of its innards cause the anime to venture into new yet familiar territory. The occasional \u201cecchi\u201d and harem antics further prevent the anime from blending itself into blandness. Parts from before also spill into others. For example, Nikumi\u2019s don bowl downgrade expands her repertoire whereas Souma\u2019s previous failings are reimagined in their reiterations. The show\u2019s relevant themes also shake up the narrative: learning from mistakes, relying on others while also making sure to rely on yourself, the importance of pouring one\u2019s all into every task, and so on.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cRelevant\u201d because cooking requires these ideas. Cooking is more than following a few lines and measurements. Cooking is a process that might involve others, incorrect cups of flour, and most of all determination. It is a skill that teaches other skills in the process. Knowing how to use a mezzaluna or knowing the multitude of spices found throughout the world is not absolutely vital to live. But such skill, knowledge, and more is gained through cooking. It is something that people take part in not because they have to but because they want to. That is what Shokugeki no Souma tries to get at: the notion that cooking is what one makes of it. Plain or avant-garde, easy or hard, cold or hot; each character from Souma to Erina tackles cooking in their own way, subsequently demonstrating cooking\u2019s influential properties. Sadly, the anime does not explore this theme outright. Shokugeki no Souma showcases cooking and talks about cooking indefinitely, but the show does not break down this theme to prove why cooking is as important as it makes it seem. Consequently, and perhaps ironically, the cooking does not have substance in the anime. The show is not wholly concerned with cooking\u2019s \u201cbigger picture.\u201d Instead, the anime\u2019s hype, comedy, and sexual content is all that matters, making its figurative carry-out less appetizing than it could have been.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, Shokugeki no Souma\u2019s narrative is tasty when it wants. The hype, variety, and cooking elements make it worth taking a bite out of even if not every bite is completely satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nShoukugeki no Souma continues treating its audience when it serves its art.\\n\\n\r\nMost notable are the character designs. Each character is without a doubt attractive; the women are given beautiful faces, frames, and figures, and the men are sculpted into pristine statues. But they, like food, have more than superficial appeal. Each character has traits that match their personality and personal characterizations. Some are easy to spot: Megumi\u2019s braided twin-tails give her that country bumpkin look and Marui\u2019s glasses give him the aura of a bookworm. Others are deeper: Nikumi\u2019s skimpy outfits and the emphasis on her breasts match her meat motif and Nao\u2019s stringy black hair and hunching coincide with her warlock-like concoctions. Others still are esoteric: Erina\u2019s purple eyes symbolize the royalty she has secured in the culinary world and Ibusaki, the master of smoke, has hair that acts as a smokescreen for his face. Souma\u2019s fiery and spiky hair representing his passion and adaptiveness, Houjo\u2019s Chinese attire following her similarly originated cuisine, and Alice\u2019s red eyes with contrasting white hair equivalent to her contrasting style of \u201ccooking\u201d are more instances of the intricacies involved with the character designs, demonstrating just how savory they truly are.\\n\\n\r\nJust as savory is the food. Each dish is jam-packed with details, from bubbling cheese to individual rice grains. The food is enticing to see, glistening, soaking, and resting in a state that is nothing short of mouth-watering. Knowing this, Shokugeki no Souma preps itself, taking shots of the food before it is devoured as well as shots of the inside to showcase what treasures are hidden within. For good measure, the aftermath is shown, just to solidify how scrumptious the food would be if it actually existed.\\n\\n\r\nExistence is an interesting topic when it comes to the anime\u2019s art because roughly half of the locations visited are not real. The show obviously takes place in regular locales: a huge kitchen filled with utensils, a fancy hotel lined with red carpeting, a local food market, and so on. It is when the food is consumed that all bets are off. Some characters go to cloud nine, the taste of the food floating the eaters through the sky. Others swim with the fishes, the food so tasty it sends them to a mermaid-filled heaven. Others still feel as if they are frolicking through a forest. In other words, the anime takes advantage of the overreactions to include backgrounds that would not normally be possible given the setting, thereby improving the diversity of the art and thus its execution.\\n\\n\r\nExecution dips slightly when it comes to the show\u2019s actual animation. To reiterate, the anime is always looking to maximize hype. To accomplish this, Shokugeki no Souma relies heavily on still shots of heroic poses and the different foods, meaning there is not much movement. Often times when there is, it is illusory, with camera shaking and \u201cspeed lines\u201d to give the appearance that actions are occurring without actually showing them in full. Of course it can pick up when it wants to \u2013 especially during the \u201cecchi\u201d moments and the big reveals \u2013 but for the most part the show\u2019s animation remains at a passable level.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma is one of those anime that has an enormous cast \u2013 somewhere in the garden of 78 separately named characters. Even eliminating the minor members and some of the side ones from the menu, the cast still numbers roughly 20 people or so. The result is that it is highly unlikely, and indeed highly unfair, to expect each and every person to have huge depth and development (given the episode and time constraints).\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Shokugeki no Souma hits three areas: characterizations, growth, and widespread development. Many of the characters in the show follow the first idea. For instance, Hayama is an exotic man, known for his commanding use of spices and infallible nose. He also has feelings for Jun, his mentor. Houjou is known as a strong, independent woman, fighting the stereotype placed on women in the workforce. Nikumi is the meat master. Marui is the guy who nearly died from exhaustion. Hisako is the herbalist, and so on. Almost everyone has something unique or special about them that makes them standout from their competitors. That is a common but important directional decision: having characters who are unique, who can be differentiated, allows the audience to understand who everyone is and where they are coming from.\\n\\n\r\nSimultaneously, many of the characters see small personal growth. Hayama started out in the slums with no friends and no family, until Jun saved him, thereby creating the emotions he has towards her today. Houjou looked down on \u201cweak\u201d women, becoming the kind of person she despised, until Megumi allowed her to realize that strength comes in all shapes and sizes. Nikumi started off as arrogant, but her time with Souma and the don bowl club allowed the tenderness of her person to finally break free. Marui, despite his initial perception, is beyond knowledgeable, leveraging the numerous books he has studied to become a sort of fake cook. Hisako is not just the secretary to Erina but instead her healer, protecting her from sickness and tribulation, making her position less managing and more cleansing. A long list, but it emphasize that the growth of the characters, while relatively small, is collectively a nice amount that is distributed to practically all of the known players.\\n\\n\r\nArguably, though, some of the characters do not receive enough attention. The biggest victim of this is Erina. She is bossy, arrogant, and mean, although she is shown to have a sensitive and embarrassed side. A connection between her and Souma\u2019s father is alluded to, but it is never outright explored. Beyond these details, there is not much else given about her. This lack of information about a pretty important character can be viewed in two ways. One, that it is a mistake. Not delving into more of Erina\u2019s past or having her around more of the cast so she can have more interactions and therefore more opportunities to grow is a glaring flaw that leads to the static character she became. Two, that it was inevitable. Given her position among the students and her impressive abilities as a chef, she never had the chance in the first place to undergo development. Either way, like someone watching a turkey cooking in the oven on Thanksgiving Day, Erina\u2019s character remains mostly on the outside looking in.\\n\\n\r\nAlice, Erina\u2019s counterpart, is coincidentally in the same pot. Like Erin, she has a servant. She is not as bossy, but she is still rather arrogant. Her cooking style is off-kilter, giving her an edge over the others. But most interesting of all, she is a cousin of Erina\u2019s, meaning their relationship goes beyond mere friendship and rivalry. Despite her mirrored yet connected characterization, Alice is not expounded on. Understandably, Shokugeki no Souma is not a complete tale, meaning that it is very probable that the timer for her development has yet to go off. Therefore, and being somewhat generous, she at least establishes herself as a tough antagonist, both to Souma and to Erina.\\n\\n\r\nA character that has to be investigated is Souma. For all intents and purposes, he is a self-insert character. Souma is super nice, he easily makes friends, he is funny, he is an amazing cook, and he is surrounded by beautiful women. But he is not perfect. Souma makes mistakes, the biggest being his near failure during the buffet. Souma does not always win, evidence being his over 400 losses against his dad and his second place finish in the Autumn Elections. Still, Souma does not change much throughout the season. He is challenged and he expands his culinary abilities, but as a person and consequently as a character, he remains more or less the same from start to finish. The main problem is the anime having to divvy up its resources between 20 or more characters, giving him less kitchen space to work with. Even from the very beginning, his presence and cooking was more to explain and characterize those around him. Erina trying his first dish, Fumio\u2019s empty-pantry challenge, Aldini\u2019s mini-duel, Megumi\u2019s unofficial \u201cShokugeki,\u201d his childhood friend aiding his hometown, and the entirety of the Autumn Elections are individual instances that feature Souma but are not designed with him in mind. Instead, he is a sous chef, not the head chef, acting as the mediator for the character or characters that really matter during those events. The only time where he actually takes the spotlight for himself is the buffet disaster, which makes sense because this is the only time the audience sees Souma in a weakened state. To put it differently, despite being the main character he is never actually the main character, lessening the impact he has on the series overall.\\n\\n\r\nIt is abundantly clear that the strongest character of the anime is Megumi. Before heading to Totsuki Academy, she was the best cook from her hometown, although she quickly discovered that that did not mean much among the cutthroat competition. Away from home and the other students noticing her poor performances, she became lonely, losing any sense of self-esteem. Just when she was about to throw in the apron, Souma appears to reinvigorate her passion for cooking. He becomes her first true friend, his overconfidence and carefree attitude rubbing off on her. For a time this worked. Her first encounter with Shinomiya, however, crushed her spirit. But she fought through this trial, finding her own strength \u2013 homely, feel-good meals \u2013 while simultaneously saving Shinomiya in the process. At this point, she realized that she had gone to the completely opposite end: where she once was doing everything herself and failing, now she was relying too much on everyone around her. Her past is eventually revealed, where she had always been a determined girl but she knew that she could not do what she wanted on her own. Thus, when the Autumn Elections roll around, she uses her newfound strength, consequently letting her find that sweet spot between all and nothing. Megumi goes from bottom of the barrel to cream of the crop, her developmental arc as palpable as possible. In other words, if the rest of the cast is the batter, then Megumi is the icing on the cake.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi, alongside the rest of the characters, has a major theme: everyone can become better than themselves. People have weaknesses: mathematics, driving, and writing are categories where guys and girls alike will willingly declare their ineptitude. Contextually, Erina is bad at getting along with others, Alice is too prideful, and Megumi is easily flustered. But those same guys and girls also have that thing, whatever it may be, that they are good at. It might be organizational skills, hand-eye coordination, or endurance. The same can be said for the characters of Shokugeki no Souma. While each cast member\u2019s specialty deals with cooking in some fashion, they still have one: Erina has her \u201cGod Tongue,\u201d Alice has her gastronomy, Megumi has her home-style cooking, Ryouko has her sake, Yuuki has her hunting, and so on. Everyone has some kind of strength, something that separates them from (nearly) everyone else. So it is about using that strength to become a better person, to realize one\u2019s full potential, and to reach those new heights that previously seemed unattainable. Doing so is never easy \u2013 practicing, training, and failing are unavoidable \u2013 but such hardship is what is required to become someone better than before. And the point is that everyone can do this.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone can become a better person. It simply takes a little bit of elbow grease.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening theme nails that hype feeling. The strumming guitar and rising vocalist resonate with the listener, pumping up the audience as much as possible. The track is actually rather simple, with drums being the only other prominent part of the piece, but the simplicity precisely elevates it into a catchy and therefore memorable arrangement. The second OP somehow heightens the hype even more so than the first. While once again sticking to guitar, drums, and a single vocalist to power the piece, the guitar is harder, the flurry of drums is more energizing, and the vocalist is more emotional. The result: another stellar and exciting piece that stays with the audience long after an episode and the series concludes.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme is not like its OP counterparts in more ways than one. Putting it lightly, the first ED is arguably one of the best ever conceived in the medium. The track encapsulates all that food is: food is light, fluffy, and spicy; yummy, flavorful, and warm; simple, complex, and fun. The rising and falling guitar, the onomatopoeia, and the heartfelt vocalist, alongside the mellow beat and catchy lyrics, make these \u201cfeelings\u201d known, ultimately creating a five-star piece.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the second ED, it takes time to warm up to, especially considering the juggernaut it had to replace. The vocalist seems incapable of carrying the piece and the instruments are all over the place. In short, it appears to be a disaster. However, when context is considered, the piece is quite clever: this is a track from and about Nao, the stalker, the socially awkward girl, the strangest woman at the academy. Knowing this, the track comes together, meaning its disjointed and disruptive arrangement not only makes sense but makes the piece ironically funny.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the soundtrack is an orchestral feast for the ears, utilizing pieces of every part of the musical pie. Slice-of-life ensembles to keep the low-key moments light on the stomach and therefore lighthearted. Intense violin tracks accompanied by acoustic guitars to amplify the emotions. And suspenseful pieces coated in hard piano notes and ambient choirs to make those current, on-screen deliberations that much more tantalizing. Also, \u201cWelcome to the World of Gourmet Foods,\u201d with its churchlike sounds and opera-esque lyrics, is the only piece that could fit those majestic moments. The OST offers a wide selection, from the culturally influenced to the personality driven to everything in-between, making it worthy of seconds, thirds, and more.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting performances in Shokugeki no Souma are far above average, with each voice actor and actress providing well-done work across the board. Risa Taneda as Erina gives a pompous voice that captures Erina\u2019s equally pompous attitude. Minami Takahashi as Megumi stars in her first big major role, switching accents and sounding cute to match Megumi\u2019s similar disposition. And Mamiko Noto as Hinako for her mature yet childish voice aligns with Hinako\u2019s own personality.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nErina is one of my favorite characters from this show. Some might not like the 90-to-10 \u201ctsun\u201d-to-\u201cdere\u201d ratio she has going on, but when that outer shell does breakdown (however infrequent it might be), it was always hilarious and adorable to witness. Alice is another fun character because she is just so confident with herself all of the time that when people do not \u201cget\u201d her and her cooking, she likewise gets cute and it simply makes me smile. And of course, Megumi\u2019s constant apologizing, clumsiness, and general affability never failed to make me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, each character is more or less likable. The women and the men are meant to be attractive, but each has their shtick much like Erina, Alice, and Megumi. Souma\u2019s smug chuckle is super contagious. Hisako\u2019s \u201cyuri\u201d feelings towards Erina are awesome. Takumi always getting cut off when he tries to act super-cool towards Souma never got old. Hinako fawning over Megumi is something that I wanted to see happen nonstop. Nikumi\u2019s blushing whenever anything Souma-related was brought up was way too cute to handle. The list goes on and on. From the comedy to the \u201cecchi\u201d to the food, the show always wanted, if nothing else, fun.\\n\\n\r\nThat is the anime\u2019s strong suit: providing an impossibly fun time. The characters, the battles, the music; everything comes together in this neat little package that, when opened, bursts forth as this undeniably exhilarating anime. Hearing Souma and Erina hum the first ED interchangeably, watching the judges go overboard with their reactions, and seeing Yuuki acting beyond silly are designed to make the audience feel good about themselves and therefore feel good about the show. The anime is ridiculous \u2013 food is not that over-the-top \u2013 but that is exactly why it strikes a chord with nearly everyone who views it. The show is absurd. It is entertaining. And that is what makes it so gosh darn fun.\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma is a hearty meal that fills the stomach and warms the soul. The juicy, seared narrative is charred but tender. Corn-on-the-cob, slathered in characterizations and developments, sits nearby. Home-cooked art that is slightly sweet. An ice cool set of soundtracks to wash it all down. The meal is clearly not perfect but because it is filled with love these imperfections do not outright ruin what this plate offers. That is to say, not even a dude who only eats cheese sandwiches, yogurt-with-sprinkles, and Coca-Cola would pass this one up.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, hype to the max, constant variety avoids gross repetition, but its lack of a purposeful theme and detracting sentimental material sours what should be sweet\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, awesome character designs, mouth-watering food, interesting backgrounds, and about average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, majority of the cast is characterized and developed proportionally well, Souma is individually subpar but purposeful for others, Megumi is great, and the theme on betterment through personal strength is a welcome bonus\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, great first OP, great second OP, fantastic first ED, good second ED, great OST, above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, the entire cast, and indeed the entire season, is never-ending fun\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "Anime and manga are known to have the potential to make a subject that for most audiences is uninteresting to a compelling, enjoyable experience: such is the case of cooking. This theme has been explored before with less succesful titles such as \"Koufuku Graffiti\" or \"Bonjour Koiaji Patiesere\", but with Shokugeki no Soma it seems to have a huge success among the audiences, but why? \r\n~Story~\r\nThe story of Shokugeki no Soma is quite straightforward: Yukihira Soma pursues to become a full-time chef in the restaurant of his father, the reason why he has to surpass his father's culinary skill. In order to achieve his goals,Soma's father sends him to an elite culinary school, Toutsuki High School, where only 10% of the students graduate. What is more, Soma makes himself the enemy of the high school on his very first day.\\n\\n\r\nIn this high school there is one exceptional rule: any grudges/disputes are held with so-called \"Shokugeki\" (hence the title of the anime) or cooking battles between the students to prove their culinary skill before judges. How the story proceeds is curious, as instead of actual class lessons about cooking itself, the spectator is shown constant tests and shokugeki's between the students,in particular those of Soma. This displays the harsh conditions of the school, while at the same time keeping the story exciting. However, this leads to a problem: there is no realistic character development that takes place (cooking wise) and most of the ingredients and cooking techniques used are explained briefly. This can be an issue for the spectators looking for more detailed cooking.\\n\\n\r\nThe nature of the plot makes the story very predictable and formulaic, however it is interesting to observe through the difficulties and mysteries that surge throughout the anime how everything is executed and developed. Some spectators may ask themselves how the quality of the cooking is displayed; this done through \"foodgasms\", including breaking of clothes, for both male and female. While the idea is interesting, it was at times too exaggerated.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThere is a big cast of characters displayed in Shokugeki no Soma, all being introduced as the story progresses. There is the main character Yukihira Soma, who is skilled in cooking itself,has no romantic interest, is arrogant and ignorant, which bothers on stupidity. This is nevertheless a good quality for the protagonists as it leads to amusing situations as well as enhancing the pacing of the story. Then you have female protagonists, such as Nakiri Erina, the one who rejects Soma in any possible manner due to their opposite philosophies on cooking; Tadokoro Megumi, the shy and unhandy village girl... The rest of the cast includes rivals, friends, parents, you name it, all with their own charm and personality.\\n\\n\r\nAn interesting aspect of the characters is that each has attributed a certain speciality in the culinary scene, with their corresponding nickname: specialists in the smoking of food, spices specialist, herbal medicine, italian food, stinking food, you name it.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development so far is nothing impressive. However, the spectator can observe through little background stories how personalities develop and the reason why certain characters have that particular personality.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and Sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of Shokugeki no Soma is well done, what is to be expected of a show airing in 2015. The animation of the characters are fluid and are well designed and very varied, making it easier for the audience to distinguish the different characters. The backgrounds are often well animated and have at times good detail. One thing that stands out is how the food is displayed, which is done through good use of the different colours available.\\n\\n\r\nTo find a fitting soundtrack for a cooking anime is difficult, and in this case some of the soundtracks used didn't quite fit the atmosphere for the anime, in particular the ones used in the shokugeki's. It nevertheless fulfills its purpose. It was nice that the staff decided to use \"Tropical Gateway\" from Duke Starwalker.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Soma was overall a very enjoyable experience, even with the predictable and formulaic approach on the story, which was compensated with the different plot twists and development of the different cooking contests, and the characters; the ecchi scenes may be a drawback for some. I can recommend this anime to anyone who likes shonens and those who are interested in cooking, though you won't learn anything groundbreaking. Note that this anime is unfinished, and thus has an open ending.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma. . . Where do I begin with this show? Well, let's start with the common description that's been drifting around the internet since its airing-- \"Food Porn\". It's an understandable title, really. Every episode features numerous mouth watering dishes that we the audience can't help but lust after. With most (if not all) episodes also featuring a foodgasm it's an apt moniker. That may cause some misconceptions however. By that description alone you may assume this to just be another throw away ecchi show. I won't lie, I had similar thoughts after the first episode that featured a truly terrifying scene involvingtentacles and a naked woman. Luckily I'm not one to dismiss a show after a single episode and I'm thankful I didn't. (And these tentacles do rear their slimy tips on occasion, but they thankfully recede quickly... *shudder* I know you niche guys with the fetish aren't pleased by that info, but the rest of us are!)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nYoung high-school aged guy, bad-ass father that leaves the country, elite institution for the best of the best where our young hero will face overwhelming odds on a daily basis to prove his worth! This is a Shounen battle anime in every sense of the term. That being said it's a battle of culinary skill rather than a brawl with fists. I can't really get into a lot of battle Shounen, I have a difficult time feeling engaged when no matter how much fighting occurs everyone is allowed to walk away. That's why this series works though! These aren't life or death contests but rather a contest of one's future and pride. \\n\r\nOne aspect of this story that I love is the way our main character Souma isn't an underdog. Sure, a lot of people look down on him, but that's due to their asinine judgment rather than his actual skill. He is a damn good cook! He knows what he's doing in the kitchen and will put others to shame. Rather than starting from the bottom to work his way to the top, he is already close to the top and has to battle those who made it there with him. \\n\r\nThe story sounds relatively clich\u00e9, but most are in this day and age. However, it is well executed. There are constant challenges for our characters to overcome, and none of them feel contrived. The nature of the school they attend calls for consistent challenges, but there is time in between these events. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe animation is great. I never dreamed food could look so superb animated. I find myself thinking \"Does fried rice look that good in real life? I don't care, I need fried rice!!\" Only to promptly be disappointed when the fried rice I prepared doesn't look quite as amazing as the one portrayed in the anime. (Still tasted good though, in case you were wondering). J.C Staff is awarded full points in my book for making the food feel so enticing. It's an ecchi show but my eyes are drawn towards the hot dish on the plate rather than the hot female who just prepared it. (Pardon the quip, I'm making a point here.)\\n\r\nThe colors are vibrant and make the entire show exceedingly easy on the eyes. The character designs are very nice. I give genuine applause to the artist of the manga for incorporating so many different styles into the characters. No two look alike and all have some sort of flare to make them memorable. \\n\r\nThe first opening is nice and pleasant to look at with sequences of animation that have become fairly standard for openings in this day and age. The ending is a slightly different story; featuring nude, chibi versions of all the characters riding some sort of food. It's remarkably odd to say the least. And I don't know who in the past few years came up with the idea to take a floor polisher to the shoulders, knees, elbows and boobs of characters, but it really isn't necessary. Not necessarily bad, but I don't see a point. I mention it because my eyes were almost glued to those raw areas that look like they'd be extremely painful... But the pinnacle of this ending is the Last Supper imagery. I think the anime is hinting at Souma being the Messiah of cooking. He was sent there by his father, he shows up and shatters all the existing laws and standards, he makes bold declarations people don't like, yadda yadda yadda. Damn... That actually really works... O.o\\n\r\nThe second opening though, damn is it good. Translated to English this show is titled as \"Food Wars!\" and this opening makes you remember that. Gigantic ladle vs. the world's 4th largest fork. Imagery of the demon chef challenging the revered goddess. Planet Earth sitting in a soup-bowl. I think I saw a light-saber somewhere, still not sure on that one. But damn, when combined with the music I got hyped for every single episode!\\n\r\nOh, and just in the off-chance that you're curious, the 2nd ending... I don't really like to talk about that... Why you ask? Well, its actually kinda creepy. I'd rather not recall that girl...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe OST did it's job. The music is appropriate for the scene, but there aren't any tracks that had that \"wow\" factor. Not to say it didn't do it's job. The intense moments have epic or triumphant music, the more lighthearted scenes have matching melodies.\\n\r\nThe first opening song \"Kibou no Uta\"  is actually really good. I wasn't sold the first time listening to it, but the almost hoarse sound of the vocalist really grew on me. The first ending \"Spice\" is far catchier than it should be, I can't even begin to count how many times that song has gotten stuck in my head. The second opening \"Rising Rainbow\" is awesome. Every time that song played I felt myself getting hyped and excited for the episode to come. I mean, I was already hyped every time I clicked \"play\", but this song just sends the thrusters into overdrive!\\n\r\nThe acting is actually really, really well done. The casting was spot on and the actors/actresses nailed the duality of the characters. There isn't that one moment where you're blown away by their performances, but there's a consistent level of quality that just makes itself apparent. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nJust as you might expect from a Shounen there's a fairly large cast:\\n\r\nSouma Yukihira- The main character of the show and an excellent addition to Shounen protagonists. I mentioned earlier how Souma was actually skilled, but what makes him standout is that he's also rather arrogant. He knows he's a good cook and isn't afraid to prove it. He got this way because he has an unrivaled determination; he worked his ass off to get his skills and takes pride in them. To accompany this arrogance is a semi-permanent state of uncaring ignorance. A famous chef? He doesn't know nor care. Prestigious institution? He's never heard of it. A rival who doesn't like him? He'll speak to them in a pleasant manner and taunt their dramatics. His ignorance borders on stupidity but creates glorious situations because he's so laid-back. Souma is also a really nice guy who isn't foolish enough to downplay the skill of others. He recognizes talent and respects it. \\n\r\nErina Nakiri- The high-class bitch with a god complex. At least, that's the initial impression we see from her. Though still early in her character, we can tell that deep down she's a tsundere with an extra dose of tsun. So, a tsun-tsundere? Bad joke? Yeah, but I think it's accurate. She's demeaning, ruthless, and sadistic. She really is a complete and total bitch. But you know, I really like Erina. Maybe my perspective is a bit skewed because I can see the future (well, I read the manga... same thing, really), but Erina really grew on me with time. \\n\r\nMegumi Tadokoro- The shy, nervous, apprehensive hometown girl. Megumi is sweet, likable, and extremely prone to panicking. She doesn't show the best cooking skills, but no matter what you're going to want to pull for her. Megumi's the girl that you just can't help but love. She's like a newborn puppy or kitten. You look at them, tilt your head, say \"awwww\" and just smile as they go around tripping on themselves as they learn to walk. If you dislike Megumi, admit yourself because you're insane. The question of her as the main heroine is more debatable, but you're going to love this girl. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters include a wide array of friends, rivals, friend-rivals, teachers, and Souma's dad (who's pretty much all of the aforementioned roles). Despite being minor characters they're all memorable and relatively unique. And though I'm not delving into detail about them, they really do form a great cast. I previously mentioned \"duality\" in regards to the voice acting, there's a very simple reason for that- a character may be drastically different when they're cooking as opposed to when they're not. Or depending on who they're around they may undergo a bit of a 180.\\n\r\nA small shout-out to Isshiki-senpai, the guy that pulls off the naked apron with an unrivaled amount of vigor. His fan-girls are not without their reasons. Oh, and a second shout-out to Alice von Einzbern. Wait, my bad, the white hair, pale skin, and red eyes threw me through a loop. Alice Nakiri, I remember now. I'm not quite sure how to describe her, but maybe I'll use the phrase \"chibi pouting and/or chibi amazement\". An adorable character to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis show was an absolute pleasure to watch. It's fun and crazy with a decent splash of ecchi to keep your eyes riveted to the screen. But it also has a pretty damn good growth story about a guy chasing his dreams. The food contests are intense, the foodgasms are riveting in a horrible yet spectacular fashion, and the show has been just one huge gigantic ball of fun and excitement. This show was definitely one of the most enjoyable shows of 2015.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma is nothing short of fantastic. I was captivated by the story to such a degree that I couldn't contain my curiosity and I set out to read the manga. After binge reading for two days straight I caught up to the manga and I can say with certainty that since we've been graced with another season, this show has only just touched the tip of the ice-berg. More Shokugekis, more rivals, foodgasms galore, and character development are all aspects one can expect for this show and whatever else may follow. Oh, and a just as a side-note, this was a faithful adaptation to the manga. Nothing was cut out except for one epic Ping Pong match -sadface-, and nothing was rushed. \\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma was the surprise hit of the season for me. No, not even the season, all of 2015. I never would have anticipated this level of excitement from a show revolving around a culinary institute for teenagers. It's comedic, it's intense, and somehow it's all about cooking!",

With many a aspiring chef coming to showcase their culinary chops, we follow the story today of an anime character named Souma, and his road to culinary greatness in, Shokugeki no Souma, Food Wars!  Let's dig in!\r\nStory: Yukihira Souma is the son of the man Yukihiro Junichiro, a man who owns only but a lowly diner.  Being an aspiring chef, Souma wishes nothing more than to best his father and proudly take over the diner as its head chef and owner.  After being confronted by somepushy buyers for the land that the diner is on, Souma valiantly protects the diner that he treasures, and successfully pushes the buyers away, he is then told by his father that for his years in high school, he will be going to the a cooking academy to learn how to cook.  BUT THIS ISN'T YOUR AVERAGE COOKING ACADEMY!  It is Tootsuki Academy, one of the most prestigious cooking school with a graduation rate of apparently, only a literal 10 people successfully passing through the third year of school.  \\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma acts a lot like your average tournament anime/manga, only this time, there's cooking involved in the battles rather than sword fights, magic fights, or what have you.  With each group of episodes, one or more characters participate in some kind of battle since the setting, Tootsuki Academy, encourages fights between the students in order to hone their skills called Shokugeki.  (Basically, food war.  Hey, that's the title of the series!)  With this concept in mind, each character as a result acts as a different opponent to our main protagonist Souma, each of whom bring their own \"weapon\" with them like a general tournament anime with the \"weapon\" being each character's own cooking style and specialty in the culinary world.  \\n\\n\r\nThe downfall of this story, especially in part due to the time constraint of a general length of an anime, is the fact that that's really all the story has to offer.  Every episode or small group of episodes is devoted entirely to a specific battle within the series, with the possibility of prompting some character development in some select people.  (Usually, it's the generic rival declaration or enemy turned friend sort of deal.)  Plus, due to the show's entire devotion to food, there is a lot of tasting that goes on in this series to the point that they devote entire episodes solely on just tasting one dish or two dishes purely because there are characters that have so much to say about it.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the show's comedy (since this show does actually have a bit of a comedy factor to it), Shokugeki no Souma mostly draws this from Souma's extremely nonchalant and sometimes innocent attitude towards things.  If someone is challenging him, he'll just brush it off as a joke and wish them luck in the next confrontation.  If someone is saying he'll fail, he'll just sit their silently, cook, then prove them wrong with a straight face.  Several characters also do this style of nonchalantness, thus adding to it, but no one comes as near frequency as what Souma does in this series.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Shokugeki no Souma is your typical tournament anime, just with food as its battle of choice rather than a bloodbath in an arena, or what have you.  The issue I have with the ending in particular is the fact that they don't end it at the end of an arc, rather, just stopping in the middle of one.  This as a result puts a sour taste in my mouth because this is essentially a \"read the manga\" ending.  (Damnit J.C. Staff.  Not again!)  They don't resolve it in as comfortable place as I would like it to be, and as such, is a bit of a disappointment in that regard.  But, you get to learn a lot about food as you're watching this show, so that's a plus.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Food-based anime  (Because there honestly aren't a lot of these.)\\n\r\n+ Casual comedy \\n\r\n+ Food learning\\n\r\n-  Generic tournament based anime\\n\r\n-  Open ending  (Ending in the middle of an arc is a fatal error for an anime IMO.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Shokugeki no Souma's characters as well follow your same traditional style of tournament anime characters.  Each character acts as either an ally or an enemy for our main protagonist, with each of them equipped with a different cooking style to separate each of them from one another.  \\n\\n\r\nUp first is our main protagonist, Yukihira Souma.  As mentioned before, Souma is a very nonchalant character, completely confident in his abilities as a chef and never backs away from a challenge.  This in turn, creates a bit of a arrogant feeling to his character as he in the series, continuously showcases his cooking prowess and his style of \"Yukihira\" cooking, which is basically adaptive cooking, to put it in simple terms.  In the show, Souma doesn't particularly change all that much.  You get a sense of him as a character as he goes through the various battles in the series, but there isn't any real growth to him as a character.  He's very nonchalant as he goes through whatever situation he's in and as a result of his sort of \"beginner's luck\", doesn't really change because the outcome is always favorable to him.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Tadokoro Megumi, the sort of sidekick to our main character.  With \"home-style\" cooking as her main weapon of choice, Megumi is the shy girl in the corner who always tries to hang in there by a thread.  As a result, Megumi serves a lot of the time as the cute, shy girl who always tries her best in cooking better and becoming more independent.  As the series goes on, you get to see Megumi progress through the various challenges that she goes through, which ends up creating some rather nice character development.  As a result of this, she is actually more of a developed character than Souma is in the show, regardless of the fact that she appears less often than that of the main protagonist.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, we have Nakiri Erina, the \"high and mighty bitch-like\" character in the series.  With regal or elegant cooking as her forte, Erina reflects that by being one of the currently best talents that the Academy has to offer in its 92nd generation.  Acting like more of a side character for the series, Erina acts like that one character that you just love to hate.  She doesn't do much in the series aside from stand in the background and criticize what, especially Souma, is doing, and as a result isn't a phenomenal character at all.  She lacks in simple involvement in the series so there's that as a flaw for her even though she was one of the few characters showcased in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast as I have mentioned before are various \"warriors\" in this tournament style anime, that serve as both allies and enemies of Souma.  We have Yuki, a master at game cooking, Ryoko, who specializes in fermentation, Shun, who loves a good smoking, and so on and so forth.  Most of these characters act as either fillers for character roles, or obstacles for Souma.  The is in part because of the tournament style of storytelling because the ones who are considered as \"allies\" don't show off as often, and inversely, the \"enemies\" or \"rivals\" on the other hand, do, since they pose a threat to our main protagonist.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Some character development for select characters\\n\r\n-  Main protagonist stays very static throughout the whole series\\n\r\n-  Side characters mostly act as plot devices to progress the story\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by J.C. staff, Shokugeki no Souma uses a very bright style of animation where the colors just pop out at you with relatively good detail.  The characters themselves are nicely detailed, and the overall animation doesn't particularly change all that much for the series, except for three different areas that I suppose, make Shokugeki unique.  \\n\\n\r\nThe least exciting of the three is the comedic areas, where the characters are simply just drawn in a simpler aspect with less details and occasional slight chibification.  As such, there's not a particularly large amount to say about it since it's mostly just all exaggerated expressions and a couple background changes.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have food.  Out of every area of art in the series, Shokugeki's food is some of the most fantastic animation I have seen out of it.  Because the series puts so much emphasis to the dishes that the characters make, J.C. Staff has done good by devoting a crapload of time and energy into making the dishes look like literal pieces of art.  They look very good to the point that you just sort of want to reach in and take a bite.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, we have the animation that this show is famous for, the food porn.  Yes, you heard me right, food porn.  (I waited all the way till now to talk about this.)  The concept of a foodgasm is very common in this anime in particular.  Because the show involves a lot of tasting of dishes, in order to encapsulate what the characters eating the food are feeling, Shokugeki no Souma always puts in some kind of imagery in order to create something in order to explain the feeling of bliss or what have you when eating the food.  As such, the food is so good that in their foodgasm fantasies, clothes rip off, people sometimes get violated by tentacles, and there are quite a few lewd-like screams.  And with the way most of the girls in this series are drawn, oh boy, they took advantage of the opportunity.  This...creates a very interesting dynamic for the series and one of the main draws of the show.  Because apparently, getting violated by yogurt and squid after eating a horrible concoction of those two ingredients equates to you getting violated by said tentacles in your mind.  There's also manservice too for all you ladies out there, so it's equal, probably.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good animation\\n\r\n+ Great looking food\\n\r\n+/-  Foodgasm ecchi scenes  (This of course, varies on how you view ecchi.)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack of Shokugeki no Souma consists of two sets of OP's and ED's.  Outright, the ED's really aren't all that memorable.  Sure, they're fun little tracks that bring the joy of just eating, but there really isn't much substance to either one of them, which is a shame because the openings are pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nInversely, the two OP's of the show follow two completely different tones.  A casual and joyful tone for its first OP in order to illustrate the beginning of the journey and the beginning to the road to greatness, and the second OP which follows the more \"serious\" side of the anime involving Shokugekis and other food wars to settle differences between characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good OP's the reflect the show\\n\r\n-  Average ED's in comparison\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: So, all in all, did I enjoy food wars?  As someone who doesn't actively search tournament style anime, Shokugeki no Souma was a rather interesting experience.  It followed the anime portion that it covered to the letter, and put everyone in their right places in terms of where they come in, how they come in, and how they interact with each other.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI in fact, did.  There was always that sweet satisfaction of Souma confidently presenting an odd dish before earning high praises because of how casual he is to just about everything.  There were also a lot of characters that I particularly liked regardless of their lack of any proper roundness of a character, and I just simply liked how hungry the series made me.  (I think I made myself something eat after each episode after at least every other week.)\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I enjoy about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint about the series from my standpoint, is the fact that it ends in the middle of an arc.  I always find that to be a dangerous call because the creators end it in someplace that doesn't tell the whole story of what's going on, leading to some unanswered questions, questions that shouldn't be left over since it doesn't give the show a proper explanation for them.  (And it doesn't look like there's going to be a season 2 any time soon.)  Some of the scenes also made me a bit uncomfortable to watch.  Since the original mangaka used to be a hentai artist, well...you can see where I'm going with this.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of both ecchi and tournament anime, man do I have the anime for you.  Shokugeki no Souma is a series entirely devoted on cooking various dishes and comparing them to each other via Iron Chef style in order to prove which one is better; that's literally the entire series.  As a result, if you're not a fan of linear plotlines like that, then you may reconsider watching this.  But if you don't mind that, or the ecchi and sheer talking that this series is somewhat plagued with, then give it a shot, you might just like it when you try it.",

            "content": "Is this anime about food or po*n?\r\nDespite the criticism \"ecchi\" genre receives, it is really one of the hardest shows to achieve perfection. It is hard to find the right balance between storyline and lust. And Shokugeki no Souma is a perfect example of what not to do in this genre.\r\nJoin Yukihira Sora on his journey to become a master chef, in which every single judge is like Gordon Ramsey and doesn't give a god da*n about just eating food. You know... quite a lot of people live on ramen you know... And as long as it's cooked properly, it's edible god damn it. Butironically, when it comes to the POWER OF FRIENDSHIP, all cooks become like me, just complimenting on any edible food.\\n\\n\r\nTL DR; This show is utter garbage. There is not a compelling story unlike literature and the already barren plot is plagued with scenes that resemble hentai.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\r\nI totally don't get where the story is going. This is the one show where the fan service just totally destroys the storyline. There are just too many useless fan services and I really can't tell whether I am watching HENTAI or anime. Seriously, the VAs kinda make it sound like it is the former. The results of any food competition just seems BS and the story is just full of holes to make any outcome convenient to explain. This lacks all elements from Aristotle's Seven Golden Rules to storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe development of the characters are really poor - like Tadokoro for example - she just straight up goes from the worst cook in the school to the best. Zero explanations. Romantic developments are utter trash. And the story itself is just as boring as possible. And they just seem to add more overpowered cooks just to get the show going. \\n\\n\r\nAnd why are there even fan services in an anime supposed to be about food? Why are there even \"food orgasims\" in the first place? Nobody does that in real life. This show already didn't have a plot and this just ruined it even more.\\n\\n\r\nAfter some time, I just skipped all cooking scenes to the results.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I'm not giving this 1/10 is because it is not a propaganda.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is utter trash; I don't get why this is so popular.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nWell, people like the fan service shots. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nI generally don't give any ratings below 7/10 on this, but the VAs makes this sound like po*n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nWell, there are a bunch of fan service characters, bunch of side characters that are just thrown away and an MC with a boring past. \\n\r\nWell, works alright for pornography.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nSeriously, just watch hentai instead or something if you are watching for the fan service shots. This show just sucked. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nThis show is between 2/10 and 3/10. I reserve scores lower than this for the absolute worst. But this anime already is a disgrace to the storytelling medium. If you are really into food, just watch any Gordon Ramsey.",

            "content": "I had watched the first episode of Shokugeki when it aired, but dropped it when I realised it would be nothing but Cooking with Gary Stu. When I learnt this anime would have a sequel, I finally decided to see if it was worth it. Perhaps it improves after the first episode and I was being too harsh, I thought with all my heart. After all, it is sitting at a solid 8.6. And so I watched it. Turns out my original hypothesis was correct: It's a load of shit. Well, now instead of wondering about it, I can at least objectively state Shokugeki noSoma is pathetic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nI will say the premise behind Shokugeki is not bad. It's about cooking and battling, comparing skills with chefs of higher skill (mainly those of the Elite Ten) to become a better chef. Unfortunately, the execution needs a bit of work.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the first half of the show is boring. From the beginning our protagonist Soma is presented as nearly perfect. I'll go into more detail about him at the characters sections, but as far as the story goes, because Soma is so proficient at what he does, the plot instantly becomes predictable. Over 80% of this show is Soma facing off against someone who is meant to be higher in skill than him, whether they be part of the Elite Ten or not, but episode after episode he continues to dish out food so good it makes women (on rare occasion men) uncontrollably cream themselves. When the equation for every episode, especially in the beginning, follows as Soma + Ingredients + Cooking skills that surpass Gordon Ramsay = Food that can manipulate anyone to do anything, I already know what will happen in episodes five, six, so on... In the words of Edgeworth from 'Boot to the Head': \"How predictably boring...\"\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the ecchi. To put it bluntly, it was overused. I don't have an issue with it if it pops up to 'spice things up a bit.' A good example here is Code Geass. Every once in a while there was a boob/panty-shot to lighten the atmosphere of a rather serious anime. Good. This is how it should be used. But when those shots BECOME the plot, it ruins an anime. Since we're talking about cooking, imagine ecchi like a fine spice. Sprinkled in, it adds a bit of flavour to an already good dish. Poured on haphazardly like the cap fell off a saltshaker makes a meal absolutely disgusting and inedible. Probably the best formula I've found for this is: If you take out the ecchi of a story and you no longer have a plausible plot, you might as well call it hentai. At least Shokugeki admits what it is, but even so, I'm not watching this to masturbate, so the show becomes even more boring and predictable.\\n\\n\r\nThirdly, and I will admit this is a bit of a nitpicky one, but the story jumped around a bit too much. Usually a story has a stated goal which it follows. The story can branch off and create other short-term goals, but it doesn't usually sway from the long-term goal when that goal is the main focus. In this case, I thought the long-term goal would be Soma working toward and winning a seat in the Elite Ten, but this goal of Soma's seemed to die out the more time he spent at camp. This isn't necessarily bad as this added a bit of plot-specific filler content to the story, but Soma was so set on winning a place in the Elite Ten it was a let down to see that goal completely forgotten, as if it was mentioned mainly for introducing an interesting plot to keep watchers hooked. Of course, as I mentioned above, it would have been rather predictable given Soma's skill, but at least it was a goal the character had rather than just 24 episodes of cooking, beating someone supposedly more skilled, and moving onto the next person.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the pacing is a bit off. In the beginning it was done all right as characters head to an academy to hone their cooking skills, but the last half of the show involving the Autumn Elections are incredibly drawn out for no reason other than filler.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 6\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here. The art of the food was done very well. However, it was so detailed compared to the characters and everything else it was nearly overdone.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nI'll make this fairly to-the-point. Let's begin with Soma.\\n\\n\r\nSoma: As stated above, from the beginning he's shown as perfect. He's not presented with really any flaw nor backstory, and when he is, it's so much later on it doesn't matter. The purpose of the first few episodes should be exposition which is used in a story to sprinkle in bits and pieces of not only the premise and setting, but also who the characters are and a bit about where they wish to be in life. While Soma is presented a few times with the goal of becoming a better cook, it becomes a rather unnecessary goal when he's already surpassed other apparently brilliant chefs. Also, any flaws or backstory that do appear exist for mere moments. He's a lot like a cooking Naruto; hotheaded and determined. But at least Naruto's hotheadedness got the better of him from time to time and was something he could learn from. With Soma, it's a personality trait that all the tsunderes can't help but adore. So, really, he's more like a cooking Kirito. No flaws, really nothing to learn from besides one rival, his father, not much backstory, and all the ladies love him. Boring.\\n\\n\r\nErina: Not much to say here. She's the bitch with the boobs. Like Soma, she has a bit of backstory, but that's put on the back burner (see what I did there?) in order to show off how truly rich and elegant she is and how much she can't stand Soma. At least she has him as a rival of some sort, but again, there is much development from this rivalry.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi: She probably had the most development out of anyone. She has a bit of backstory that helps her grow as a cook, but unfortunately she relies too heavily on Soma to make her truly develop rather than deciding for herself how and when to grow. \\n\\n\r\nLast, Takumi: Arguably the best character in my opinion. He has a sibling, he has a personality, and he has a flaw, no passion to cook, but even so, he worked toward a goal of learning how to cook. They should have made him the protagonist...or at least kept him in the show. By about episode 10 he's no longer around. He does make a reappearance in the Autumn Elections, but only briefly, so one of the most interesting characters is used for a few moments of rivalry with Soma only to be forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki is not the worst thing I've watched, but certainly not the best. Certainly not worthy of that 8.6 rank. It skips exposition, introducing characters early on only to introduce their backstories and flaws and goals twenty episodes later. It completely cuts out characters with potential. The beginning is well-paced, but boring while the ending is drawn out and also boring. Its protagonist is too perfect while everyone else with potential and personality are used as side characters or boner-producers. Once it does become interesting, it's only for a moment before reverting back to the same formula: Perfect character is unbeatable, who would have guessed. In conclusion, this anime had potential, but didn't expand on it as unfortunately boobs are more important than plot and interesting characters.",

            "content": "I honestly went blind into this anime and had no idea what to expect well except for food. But, my reason for continuing to watch this show was because of I can\u2019t believe I am saying this \u2013 the parts where people become stark naked and have orgasms from the food they eat. Not to mention, that the tentacle porn like scenes also made me question how this show would go down. No kidding!\r\nBut, even though that\u2019s one aspect of this anime that grabbed my attention- but yet it still wasn\u2019t obviously enough for me to consider food wars even as a decent anime atthat point. I thought at most this was going to end up being a guilty pleasure for me- because at first this was show was basically people getting pleasured by food. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, what made me truly love this show was the competition aspect of it. I mean, I find it really interesting at how all the students are pressured to the point of basically wanting to commit suicide over cooking five star meals. Like I mentioned earlier, in this school only 10% of the students make it out alive and they are pushed basically beyond their limits. In this school, it\u2019s basically go big or go home situation for all the characters and it heavily reminded me of competition shows like Hell\u2019s Kitchen or Masterchef- where everyone judging your food is ten times harsher than Gordon Ramsey and Joe Bastianich combined. \\n\\n\r\nAnd just when you think, that the characters have gone through it all- turns out that the hell you thought they were facing was just a prep for the actual hell they are going to face. Any normal person, in their situations would have simply cracked under pressure and would have required major therapy to go on with life. I swear, the challenges are tough and kind of similar to the ones in HunterXHunter just with food.  But, we thank god we have a great cast of characters that manage to shine brightly in whatever challenge they face whether they win or lose.\\n\\n\r\nFirst in line, we have got our main male character Yukihira Sohma the underdog in Totsuki due to the fact unlike others he just worked in a local restaurant. Sohma despite being your average shonen protagonist was very likeable. I loved how confident he was and that he\u2019d face every challenge without breaking a sweat. He also never looked down on his opponents despite being like this and even helped others out too. One issue I had with his character in particular- that it seems that his victory is always guaranteed. Because he is the main character \u2013 not to mention all he seems to is win . But, what saved his character from being a disappointment that he was technically not the best and that he would work hard in improving his craft. He wants to outshine his dad- and he always fails in defeating him- reason why he becomes determined to be the best.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Erina Nakiri, the first main female protagonist of the show and also a potential love interest for Yukihira. And let me just say, that\u2019s it been a while since I have come across an annoying spoiled and bitchy tsundere. For the time being, I hate her guts and I am hoping that would change by the end. What I dislike the most about her character is the fact- she is full of herself and basically considers herself better than others. Everybody in her eyes are meagre peasants while she is the queen. Not to mention, her unfair treatment of Sohma in the second episode pissed the living hell out of me. She is literally the worst girl in the show and possibly one of the worst characters to come out in 2015.\\n\\n\r\nWe now Sohma\u2019s other potential love interest Megumi Tadokoro who is basically the opposite of Sohma and is a breath of fresh air compared to this bitch. She is timid, shy and scared shitless went dealing with a challenge unlike Sohma. Megumi is hands down the most relatable character in the show and I always rooted for her since her introduction in EP3. People think Sohma\u2019s the underdog when truth be told it\u2019s actually Megumi who manages to knock it out of the park with her cooking. But, she does screw up a lot and ends up getting poor grades because of nervous she gets. But, she gets probably the most character development and does her best to conquer her fears and prove to everyone that she does indeed belong here. \\n\\n\r\nI especially loved the bond she had with Sohma and they suit each other perfectly because of how their personalities contrast with one another. Sohma basically gives her the push she needs and helps her realize that she should cook while being calm and having fun in the process. I also love how much Sohma cares for Megumi and almost gets expelled in the middle of the show for her sake. Megumi thanks to Sohma, ends up improving a tonne and starts believing in herself more. That\u2019s why I ship these two like crazy and I swear if the mangaka makes Erina end up with Sohma then I will kill a bitch. Cause sweet and caring Megumi honestly deserves it more than this childish princess. Also, we don\u2019t want Food Wars to have a tragic ending by making Sohma end up dealing with the atrocity that is Erina Nakiri.\\n\\n\r\nI also loved yes Sohma\u2019s third potential love interest Mito Ikumi, Erina\u2019s cousin Alice (who is awesome unlike her), the Aldini brothers, Akira, Erina\u2019s assistant Hisako and they were all surprisingly given a fair amount of character development. It was a really clever idea to showcase the characters backstory when they present their food while nervously awaiting the judgment. It hence makes us worry for them even more. I honestly love all the characters in the show due to their over the top and unique personalities, with the exception of Erina Nakiri of course- which is obvious given how much I ranted about her earlier on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFood Wars however did not only give importance to the characters but also to the food which was obviously necessary. But, instead of just exploring Japanese cuisine they also dived into others like Italian, Indian, and Chinese etc. which I truly appreciate. They also didn\u2019t spew out anything complicated for us to understand but by the end we were thoroughly impressed at their knowledge of food- which is the key in cooking. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Food Wars was done by JC Staff- who I am a fan of. And even though JC staff have put out better looking shows in the past they still did a great a job with this one. They especially exceuted the food tasting scenes where the characters do that thing exceptionally well not to mention they made the food look good enough to make your mouth water. Hence, making Food Wars a terrible anime to watch during Ramadan for Muslims or basically anytime you are hungry. That\u2019s why I recommend you eat while you watch this show. \\n\\n\r\nI love both the first OP and especially the ED for Food Wars and I consider them better than the second ones - and I wish they didn\u2019t get replaced in the second half. \\n\\n\r\nAs for flaws of this show I would say that it takes about five episodes to get really good. Its when all the characters are properly introduced is when the show starts getting better. Also, after something as epic as a the arc dealing with the students at that camp- the karage arc felt very underwhelming to me. Thank god it only last two episodes because I got scared thinking that Food Wars would go downhill beyond that point. But thank god, it didn\u2019t it just got better and better!\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, what makes Shokugeki No Soma great are the characters, the challenges they face and the facts of food that are presented to us. The orgasming to food part is just a bonus and I hate how people are simply basing their opinion on the show simply based on that aspect. I know I also judged the show due that same reason at first- but it was easy to look past it given all the other stuff it offered me. The main reason, I guess I made this review is to fully inform those who think Foods Wars is basically unique form of fanservice that it\u2019s a show definitely worth not looking down upon. If you still didn\u2019t like Food Wars then I guess that\u2019s your problem!\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I would love to award Food Wars with an 10 for being addictive and interesting as hell- I have to give it a 9 because about seven episodes were underwhelming and not on the same level of brilliance as the rest. But, none the less Food Wars is a MUST WATCH show but avoid it at all costs if you are a Muslim fasting during Ramadan!\\n",

I knew it was about food and I'd seen pictures on various social media of the food that comes from this series\u2014it's beautiful! There hasn't been very many anime that centers around food so it piqued my interest.\r\nWhile Food Wars is definitely surprising\u2014shocking, even\u2014I was extremely disappointed to find that it has no plot, no interesting characters, character development was nonexistent, and it's just an overwhelming amount of gross ecchi-ahegaoman-service. Within the first 5 minutes of the pilot episode, the viewers had the misfortune of watching an underage child orgasm from eating food the red-haired kid (whose name escapes me; he's not interesting enough to remember) and suddenly get attacked and sexually violated by an octopus...all because the redhead made an octopus dish. I felt my brain liquefy from the stupendous amount of absurdity. I like my anime with a lot more meat on their bones and not just pretty animation of food.",

            "content": "Before watching Shokugeki, I did not know how to cook. After watching Shokugeki, I don\u2019t know shit about food at all.\r\nFood so real, you\u2019re going to cry - Shokugeki no Souma review\r\nThe story begins with a cooking face off between Yukihira Souma and his father, Yukihira Joichiro. Ever since Souma began cooking, he has always wanted to surpass his father and take the mantle of the head chef of their family restaurant. Souma is 15 and his father has enrolled him into Totsuki academy, the top culinary school in Japan, in order to expand his cooking skills and experience a whole new world of cooking.Now that is what a shounen is. Once he enters Totsuki, during the opening ceremony he makes his dominance palpable to everyone, asserting his confidence that he will not lose to anyone until he defeats his father.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with such an already fantastic start, we\u2019re given great direction and writing to feel what shounen is again, or rather a damn near perfect show. Right at the first few episodes, we\u2019re already introduced to the big shots of the culinary world, each with their own unique tastes and personality. It accomplishes a foreboding atmosphere expressing the skills and craft of those who fight for hegemony of the culinary world. Now that is bad ass. Immediately Souma is engaged in an early battle against one of them, and I think anyone can assume what will happen.\\n\\n\r\nSince the early days his cooking career began, Souma had always lost to his father, fermenting his skills and experience through loss, especially against one who was once one of the top at Totsuki. From here we learn that our main character isn\u2019t just some cocky and overrated dude. He has legitimate scores to boot what he barks when in face of his peers. Tadokoro Megumi is a shy and feint hearted girl who had yet to break her through her prisoning shell. But through the help of Souma\u2019s advisory and charisma, she is able to bring out her true self and show to the world she isn\u2019t just some useless girl who got lucky in enrolling Totsuki. Nakiri Erina being just about as cocky as Souma isn\u2019t developed as much as our other characters, but slowly with each episode opens to an insight of who Yukihira really is, even though it is situational irony that us the audience already know. However it doesn\u2019t hinder the story one bit. Everyone of the other cast members are given enough time to develop in their own small ways and improve however more enhanced by the dialogue given by spectators, as well as being charismatic in their own right.\\n\\n\r\nDialogue and direction of the show is done excellently. For a show that is about cooking, we actually are given enough details to know what ingredients are used in the food and how it is cooked. Each episode we\u2019re introduced to fantastic new dishes from a variety of different cultures from around the world. Not one moment is there overlapping food choices as we are shown food types and ways of cooking normal people outside of the culinary world would never have thought of before. It\u2019s inspiring and does its job of making us hungry, if you know what I mean ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). Being seriously, it does make you want to eat prior to watching the show.The narrative Shokugeki tells is compelling in the contained story that is it. It is kept small but so varied that not one moment felt dull.\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki proves a worthy contender in all categories of art, animation, and sound. The food looks better than anything I\u2019ve seen in real life, I could almost eat it from my screen. Animation is beautifully done. Blended with the art it aspires itself to go beyond each new episode every week, furthering what else it can accomplish. The voice acting and bgms enhance the experience to a whole new level. At first the foodgasms may be a turnoff for the fear of it being overused and pushed into your face just to put out sexual content, it surprisingly handles it maturely at times when it is needed. And it offers comedy in many of those moments as well, like as if the food was so great that Souma literally punched a judge in the face. Openings were alright to me, with the first ending being my favorite of the songs. With all three elements combined, it offers a surrounding greatness to it.\\n\\n\r\nWith all said and done, I think it\u2019s time I gave Shokugeki no Souma a high score of 9/10 with a fucking fantastic seal of approval. There are many terrible shows that came out in 2015, but Shokugeki proves that there are still shows out there with great writing and stand the test of time. And it is a show that I can recommend with no doubt. It is for sure that this show is one I will use to measure in those of its genre. Now then, I\u2019m off to write my next review.",

This is a work of art!

You might end up hungry after watching every episodes.  Souma (MC) isn't the main source of comedy here, he's not even a wacky character like luffy. He's a smooth operator, i like that his character was already built as a good cook from the start, though still lacking of experience. Unlike other anime with MC having good potential but fundamentally zero background/basics about their stuff.  Most ofthe Enjoyment here came from the situations like whenever they ridiculously react after they tasted the dish, some are awkward because of the ecchi scenes. Even some of the casual conversations are funny enough. You will eventually know why its really called FOOD WARS on its later episodes, don't wanna spoil but just think of the tv show \"iron chef.\"\\n\\n\r\n    Just take the story as it is, enjoy and don't expect something dark or depth on it. Its about Yukihira souma trained to cook by his father since childhood. They own a diner but souma's old-man closed it to work abroad and to fund his education in totsuki academy, where the culinary adventure starts.  \\n\\n\r\n    Art and sound are great! watch it on HD and you will appreciate it more.  Food appearances may not be detailed or realistic all the time which is not really an issue unless you are keen about details or seeing the ingredients on its realistic art.  Of course this show will also teach you cooking but don't expect to learn some advance techniques, even though they explained how the dishes were made. Its hilarious from ep. 1 to 24 but on a serious note, characters here are all aiming to improve their crafts, and achieve their personal goals.  \\n\\n\r\ni might not attempt to read the manga, so it will not spoil the 2nd season when i watch it. cheers!\\n",

When this show was first announced (being an avid reader of the manga series) I was with one of my friend and I almost slapped him for not being excited over its adaptation's release. Luckilythis show almost completely avoids the slice of life genre and instead adopts the much hated ecchi shounen wombo combo. However instead of being a train wreck like most of those shows end up being, it instead leans more towards comedic scenes that have some hints of ecchi thrown into it, but the amazing thing is that none of it takes away from the cooking aspect of the show, which is what 90% of the show is based around, awesome and epic cooking. Whether it be traditional cooking techniques, the integration of gastronomical sciences in modern cooking styles, or theoretical cooking sciences, this show has it all; and for people such as myself who very much so enjoy cooking as a hobby, this show is a breath of fresh air for the many lack luster cooking anime out there. Now let's get on with the review!\\n\\n\r\n!WARNING! (stop reading if you don't want to be spoiled about anything at all)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 9\\n\r\nTo start off, a quick look, at the large cast of characters is my favorite place to start. This show, like my previously reviewed show Nanatsu no Taizai (check it out if you don't recognize the name) has a large cast of colorful and fun characters. Some of them will make you laugh: Isshiki Satoshi, some serve as the tsundere archetype: Ikumi Nito, you've got your goofy and possibly stupid rival: Takumi Aldini, and plenty of other characters who are all tons of fun and interesting. In fact while Soma, the main character, is a pretty good example of character development. I personally find that he shines more as a catalyst to other characters development and change. It's thanks to him that Tadokoro Megumi grows so much as a character, going from being down on herself and believing herself to be a terrible chef, to becoming one of the more likely characters to maybe even outshine Soma himself. Similarly with Erina Nakiri, while she might not seemingly change all that much, the truth is that her character is supposed to be stubborn and set in her ways, so in changing even slightly we see in fact a huge development in character. Soma practically breaks her confidence bubble which she is able to maintain around anyone else, and forces on her the desire to seek further achievements than what she thought possible in the past. Soma is more than just a main character, he is the fuel that feeds the flames burning in many of the characters, he gives them more life and makes them more vibrant.\\n\r\nPlot: 8\\n\r\nPacing: 9\\n\r\nAs for the plot there isn\u2019t much that I can really say without spoiling too much, or without sounding like a broken record. I mean as much as I like cooking there is only so much you can use from the field while still managing to hold the viewers\u2019 attention. The show is about cooking so you can\u2019t really expect anything huge in terms of plot twists, it\u2019s not like there is going to be any huge political commentary on how cooking is bad or wrong as that would not fit the atmosphere of the show. Which means that I am happy with where the story is at, and am not going to ask it to do anything more as it probably couldn\u2019t. Pacing has the same regard. Not sure how it could be improved if at all possible, however it wasn\u2019t executed perfectly either, almost though. Normally I would have an example however it\u2019s more of a feeling I got from the show rather than something I observed if that makes sense. Maybe it\u2019s just something that this type of show just can\u2019t fulfill do to its style.\\n\r\nArt Style/ Art Direction: 9\\n\r\nMusic/ Sound: 7\\n\r\nI find that the art choice fit well with this type of show, while it was nothing life changing it was very well executed and definitely made me want to eat whatever was served as I got to see the juices bubble, the steam rise off of freshly cooked meals, and the see the crunch of fresh vegetables and the fatty marbling of high grade meats. It was very visually appealing and definitely deserves props for its execution if anything else. The music sadly was the most disappointing part of this whole show in my opinion, most of the soundtrack was pretty standard and didn\u2019t really offer me anything to add to my current list of favorite songs, the only exception to that was the very first ED (if you haven\u2019t heard it yet definitely check it out). That was the song that I listened to fully every time after all of the episodes, and was even saddened when it was no longer used in the second half (obviously knew it would change though).\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 86/100 \\n\r\nUnfortunately the scoring system doesn\u2019t allow for decimal points so the score I\u2019ll give this show is a little lower than I\u2019d like to give it. However this show in my opinion does not deserve a 9 in the slightest no matter how good it is. Which is why I rounded down instead of up. \\n\r\nThank you very much for reading my review, if you have any questions, comments, or just want to say hi just shoot me a message I\u2019ll gladly respond. I hope you have a nice day.",

            "content": "[3.0/10] - DROPPED\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nFor anime that I've decided to drop and do have something to say about, I decided to write up some short thoughts on the subject matter. This isn't as structured or well put together as some of my other reviews, however, I figured to try my best and describe what exactly about this series didn't do it for me and determine why exactly it didn't work. \r\nShokugeki no Souma is a series that follows Yukihira Souma, a kid who just entered a prestigious cooking school that's treated like some kind of Olympics training camp in this world. In this special school, he meetsall kinds of colorful characters and scenarios in which cooking determines the end result of everything. Want to go into your dorm room? Cook off! Want to decide what to do in class? Cook off! What time to go to bed? Cook off! If you've seen virtually any shounen action anime then chances are you've seen this kind of setting before.\\n\\n\r\nIt's No Game No Life, it's Hunter x Hunter, it's FMA, well, maybe not that close to the latter two. The point here is that the setting isn't unique, and the entire idea isn't much of a twist, either. When I rolled this show to watch, because I usually let fate decide the next series I will consume, I was fairly interested since I heard that it has a very unique and satirical take on Shounen action shows. However, to my unfortunate realization, Shokugeki isn't really a twist on anything. It's just a shounen action show but now it has food in it. That's not a twist. That's just an idea. It's a shounen action show but the idea here is they fight with food rather than fists. But is that idea enough to carry the series? \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nShort answer : No, not in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue here is that I've seen this all before, and I haven't even watched that many anime. It goes to show  how repetitive this medium has become when I could predict virtually every cliche chucked on screen carelessly. \"Oh, is this girl taking a bath? I guess it's time for the protagonist to walk in on here!\" The humor here is kind of awful. There's an over-reliance on wacky faces, which isn't necessarily unfunny, but when it's all just chibi reaction-images with a few \"foodgasms\" thrown in for good measure it all just blends together in this jambalaya of boring nonsense. \\n\\n\r\nIt is almost as if the creators are checking off a list of \"Shounen must-do's\" while creating this series and it all feels inconsequential. All of these characters have been done before. All of these interactions have been done before. And I don't need a massive catalog in anime watching to understand that, which is so disappointing for a pretty huge medium with hundreds of shows coming out every year. How come one shounen action series can speak for them all? Where's the subversion? Where's the \"twist\" that is talked about? \\n\\n\r\nAnother saddening downside is that to my knowledge this show might actually provide some engaging and subversive material but i'm in the camp of people that believes that a series needs to put its best foot forward. I don't have all the time in the world to sit through something I'm genuinely not enjoying just to hopefully get to something good. Don't confuse this mentality with slow series, or series that may start out with a poor example of their abilities.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of shows out there with bad first episodes but end up providing some amazing entertainment. The problem here is that I always find something to attach myself to. For example, a live action series by the name of \"Black Sails,\" delivered a pretty awful first season but quickly picked up within its second, third, and eventual fourth season and became a great product. The difference between shokugeki and Black Sails, though, is that there were elements which I enjoyed within the empty and stupid first season of Black Sails. While in Shokugeki I often found myself checking the time and yawning. \\n\\n\r\nI'm sure for anyone who enjoys Shounen action tropes and generic anime fanservice and humor would enjoy this series. But for me, it really doesn't offer enough of anything, especially since I found its over-reliance on said tropes to be banal. There was nothing here other than this collecting of cliches that are accessibly translated into a food-related atmosphere. Of course everything else is textbook. \\n\\n\r\nThis leads me to the characters, which are all boring. Our protagonist, Soma, is near-unbearable with his monotonous characterization that speaks to this shows formulaic design. He's just the anime every-man. His flaws are non-existent within the first seven episodes I've seen and that's really not inspiring. His flawless nature and natural talent leave an empty husk. His mannerisms and actions are all the same stale bullshit you see within most other shounen protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nWhether they give him more character or not in the future, the point is that this isn't worth sitting through. Perhaps they develop his flaws more, however, there needs to be a base of it all. There needs to be initial intrigue. Virtually every other character, regardless of their screentime, is the same level of lifelessness. We have Megumi who's the shy one, there's a few other no-name secondaries that serve no purpose other than to fill an anime girl/guy archetype, and then a few villains which are equally mundane and end up jerking off the main character at some point. \\n\\n\r\nThat's the point, though, a self-insert protagonist that plays towards a power fantasy. With a newer concept that is less punch-oriented and more food-centric. If you like well-drawn food that's absurdly sparkly then this show could be visually engaging, but to me, again, it just sang tediousness. The food didn't really look good, being a mesh of brown coloring that's significantly over-blown and sparkly with all kinds of juices leaking out. They portray it in a sensual light, but it's the kind of sexual nature that most anime has. By that I mean very childlike and lame. \\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of \"foodgasms\" to be had here. So guys having decently funny slapstick mixed in with girls just having boring sequences where they are naked. I guess I'm expecting a bit more? Oh man, this guy had this crazy reaction to this food! And then the girl character tried it and she lost her clothes and moaned really loudly. That's... funny? Ha...ha? \\n\\n\r\nI really don't see the creativity here. Every girl has two body types. There is the loli-esq student and the crazy-busty student. They all have unnatural proportions. The girls in this series are just a set of titties with colorful hair and some outfit accessories. Which is the same complaint I had towards the exploitative nature of No Game No Life. It's not as bad here, but that's because this show is just not as fanservice-heavy from what I can tell.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the fanservice here is very blatant and still constant enough for me to realize how laughably childish it all is. I know I sound like a grumpy old man here, but can't we actually have some adult sexuality for once? This is not funny. This is not creative. This is not anything. It's just a checklist of anime cliches that permeates throughout this inherently pulpy and childish medium and it is consistently making me more and more jaded.\\n\\n\r\n\"Oh man, the camera focused on her titties which make a sloshing sound akin to two wet rags smacking each other!\" \\n\\n\r\n\"Oh man, another shot of her jugs! How creative!\" \\n\\n\r\n\"Oh man, they're focusing on her two personality traits!\" \\n\\n\r\nYou see what i'm getting at here? Sexuality isn't inherently bad. If a character dominates her own sexuality and wears it on her sleeve then I'm much less annoyed than I am when I see this completely unrealistic anime archetype with a \"pure yet totally obscene and sexual girl\". However, even when a character in this show definitely does own her sexuality, like Mito, it's quickly used to ridicule and dehumanize. Instead of having this be a character trait, she quickly becomes an object of embarrassment and it's just cringe-inducing. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't inherently unattractive, either, they are just drawn in such amateur and childish ways that nothing about this successfully proves interesting. The constant lingering on their breasts or legs is repulsive enough, but nothing about these character's appearance is emphasized apart from these more sexually exploitative parts. It creates for walking sacks of meat rather than sexually interesting characters or even interesting characters at all. Whatever this series was going for, I never really felt like it succeeded. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy here is really sub-par, as well. It lacks any flavor, no pun intended. There is nothing to it. Just a bunch of reaction images, wacky faces, chibis, and moaning with a heavy dollop of generic-as-all-hell fanservice. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Shokugeki failed to captivate me in just about any way. The presentation here isn't too bad. The animation is fine and occasionally lively, the direction is boring, but everything else falls totally flat. The story is just any generic shounen, the characters equally so, with the over-reliance on the creative idea to carry it. That being said, an idea rarely ever carries a series, especially since it requires more than a concept to really create a spectacular, believable world. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue here is that it's not ridiculous enough to be considered satire, either. Shounen has a tendency to be over-the-top and extremely pulp-oriented, so what exactly is this show accomplishing? I mean, if you've seen any of the escalation in something like Attack on Titan or FMA then you'd know exactly what i'm referring to. Shounen action as a concept is already absurd, so associating it with food doesn't really point out anything bizarre or over-the-top. What i'm saying, is that this show isn't goofy enough. It isn't creative enough for this concept to really flourish within it's generic pool of archetypal characters. \\n\\n\r\nApologies for the abridged review, but I felt like I should address my issues with this series. The reason I try with all these kinds of genres in anime, even if they are naturally unappealing as an idea is due to the fact that I believe a genre has more to offer than one kind of story. So I try my best to give every kind of genre its deserved due diligence. \\n\\n\r\nThe saddening idea here is that this show doesn't capture that idea, and if it does in it's later episodes then I'm sure the people who pushed through this fairly horrendous initial showing are ecstatic. This show is just generic and that doesn't mean that it is mediocre. Our standards shouldn't be set that low. I found that every sub-par episode made my attitude towards this series consistently negative and that regrettably created for a lousy watching experience plagued with disappointment.",

            "content": "Just your average-everyday anime-viewer here, with another review!\r\nWith the summer-anime-season finally ending and many, many reviews have hit the board on MAL, I feel like I just slow-lagged myself onto the computer and thought: \"Yeah, what will be my chosen review from the menu of this season?\". Well, if you are blind in any way, shape or form, either you can't read that this review is about the fan-loved and highly appreciated show \"Shokugeki no Souma\", or you are LITERALLY BLIND AND CAN'T EVEN READ THIS GODDAMN REVIEW OR EVEN WATCH THE SHOW AT ALL! And...I feel so so so sorry if I offended anyonewho might actually BE blind and being able to read this...but what I can tell you is that despite being a great if not a fantastical show, in more aspects than one, this show ain't perfect. But it ain't bad either, oh, far from it my friend! Like a real chef (such as an amatuer myself), this show hides it's weaker and more bland parts of the dish and covers it up with an amplified strong-point and often in several layers! And if you are already heading for that \"Not Helpful\" button, make sure that you smack that one as hard as you can because I don't give a crap!\\n\\n\r\nBefore reading on, this review is spoiler-free, so don't worry should you want to watch this show after reading the review. I take it that you've read the synopsis yourself and maybe even watched the show. This review also comes with a TL;DR section as well as a few additional details, right at the bottom before the conclusion. I will only refer to the ANIME and not the MANGA from which this show originates from, although I might throw in a note of things to come or reference to the original source-material (since I'm reading the manga right now). Beware that alot of food-related terms might pop up here and there in this review. You have been warned. Beware also that this review might get long, just sayin'. You have now been warned twice.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story: 8/10\\n\r\nAlthough not the most original plot ever concieved, Shokugeki takes the generic recipe and amplifies it to a degree where it perfectly balances between the flavours \"Great Plot\" and \"Parody\". Although its main-focus is pretty straight-forward and actually easy to follow, the \"Parody\" comes as an aftertaste, adding a tonal flavouring to the mix. I love when shows does this, only as long as shows SELFAWARENESS, the cornerstone of parody. And Shokugeki displays many moments and events showing their selfawareness towards die-hard and superserious action-plots. This is also one of the shows \"a-little\" weaker parts. Yes, they are fun to watch and are exectued hilariously (DO NOT FORGET ABOUT THAT), but Shokugeki either re-uses them quite often to the point of \"Dafuq, again?\" or they just shrug it off completely, which parodies does not do. Parodies embrace the quirkiness and makes them to an original and fun punchline. I won't say that Shokugeki failed to do so, but their overall execution and intensity could be more controlled. Other than that, the anime follows the manga faithfully if not perfectly. More than one time, I had to compare stills from the show to pages from the manga and they were pretty much are identical. Another thing I want to point out is that the level of interest and climaxes varies wildy from different parts of the show to another. Not only that, but the way Shokugeki builds up the climax is absolutely insane (in a good way, of course). It's like going on a roller-coaster and when it's time to go down, it goes hella fast. But, the show doesn't have the same power in every story-related climax, and is only reserved to the main-dishes of the show, which I believe was a smart strategy to go. That way, they make the climaxes that matters matter even more. And that doesn't also mean that the other \"smaller\" climaxes are bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: 8/10\\n\r\nNever in my life before have I ever experienced a Foodgasm the way they depict them in the show with that great emphasis on a more \"Ecchi\" approach. But then again, I have never eaten such food that is so innovative and displayed with genuine and faithful mirroring of real-life-food. Again, this is a part of the parody I mentioned in \"The Story\", but that is what makes this show not only fun to watch, but it serves as their trademark speciality as well. Outside of these \"Ecchi-foodgasms\", Shokugeki holds itself to an stronger neutral point between \"Original\" and \"Generic\". What I mean is that I feel like it's neither. On one hand, the enviroment looks detailed and the utensils and ingredients look surprisingly natural as Shokugeki holds up to the same formula as many anime do in the industry. On the other hand, just through the art, you'll actually see our characters emotions, stress and work-flow. Talking about work-flow, it kinda disappoints. It is often hidden to keep the dish in a mystical-feel and when we finally get to see the action, it's either a paned still or a mini-gif. But combined with the music and talk-overs of our characters in the kitchen that gradually explains what they are currently doing to thoughts of reasoning and action taking place, it still feels like a flow of water at work. There is one particular episode which is absolutely mind-blowing since you actually get to see and witness the epicness that our chefs do (you'll know which one if you've seen the show). To summarise, it's not the most generic pieces of art you've seen this summer, but it looks far from an original and the way they display the food is gonna make you hungry either way XD\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound: 8/10\\n\r\nI'll start off the same way an episode of a usual anime starts, with the OP. Having two OPs, the first one being \"Kibou no Uta\" performed by Ultra Tower is one that reflects the show's personality right from the start with neutral intensity and along with that competitive egde that of which this show has immensly great amounts of, OP1 embraced that tone and out comes a great signature OP for our ears to listen to while we ourselves get ready for the show. And as they usually do, they replace it halfways. Compared to the first, \"Rising Rainbow\" performed by Misokkasu is handled a little differently as the epic guitar steals the show and gives us a more intense and powerful opening in contrast to the first. OP2 uses empowerment and inspiration as it's way to play the game and it works not only for us but for the show as well, reflecting Souma's core purpose of this show. Inside the episode, there are many trademark soundtracks befitting different situations that occur in the plot. All are great to listen to and are often on par with masterpieces made by Hiroyuki Sawano (may you live a long life...)(ok, maybe not but close enough), but the problem here is the repetitiveness and re-occurance of which most if not all soundtracks have. There's that same soundtrack for when they cook, present, explain, rebuttle, reason, epic and so on. But they are set on repeat. Don't get me wrong, those soundtracks doesn't elevate the situation, it adds chili to the mix and out comes the most pumped-up and blood-boiling music that absolutely dominates our ears and combined with dat gorgeous gorgeous animation that's like a feast for your eyes, Shokugeki is a great example of how a show should be done as (on a technical level).\\n\\n\r\nThe Character(s): 9/10\\n\r\nNow, to the meat of the dish. With many characters representing their own category in many different ways, we've got our \"hero\" (Souma), our \"yandere\" (Erina), the \"shy\" (Tadokoro) and the \"rival\" (Takumi). Great! And then another \"rival\"? And another yandere? And even more characters?! Shokugeki, this is a 24-episode dish. You can't have as many characters as you want! So, enough about that comedic add-on. Our characters in Shokugeki are easily rememberable and you can easily tie their personality (and therefore, identity) with how they look, since all characters are easily distinguishable from on another and all play a great role in all of the arcs of this show. The characters might feel generic, but I actually see them with a refreshing originality mixed in with the generic. Then there's the small problem of which I (and hopefully you) will had to add a pinch of salt to since this show had that parody-feel to it. Many characters dreams and reasons are standard \"oh, I've got to be the best because [add action-generic reason]!\" and that's fine and all, considering that Shokugeki is a semi-parody towards action shows. But these reasons become a part of our characters identity and they (again) shrug those of as if it was nothing. One prime example is the reasoning of Takumi Aldini, Souma's \"rival\" whom Souma himself probably doesn't even see him as one. This strikes a cord within me, since Shokugeki is a parody but wants to keep the serious elements of an action-plot. That's not how you do it. You go all the way or you go home.\\n\\n\r\nMy Enjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis ride was more than awesome, more epic than I can describe. It just felt that despite having 24 episodes, it felt way too short and the ending simply begs for a sequel/season 2. Rewatching this show is more than welcome, as it adds a familiar heat to your tastebuds and you might actually learn a thing or two from the show which are REAL TRICKS to making food taste even better!\\n\\n\r\nHow it was Overall: 8.6/10\\n\r\nThis show is seen on multiple \"Top Ten anime of summer-season 2015\" and with damn good reason. Despite having a few issues, they just felt like literally insignificant towards the parts that made it's signature and trademark of the show! Have I rewatched it? Stupid question, more like: How many times have you rewatched it (like five times)? Pumped and ready for season 2? You bet!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\n+ Straight-forward\\n\r\n+ Easy to understand\\n\r\n+ A slight Parody to the mix\\n\r\n+ Climaxes of epic proportions\\n\r\n- Disregard of several parodic-core-elements\\n\r\n+ Mirrors the Manga great if not perfectly\\n\r\n+/- Demands a sequel, read the Manga instead\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\n+/- Not the most original piece of art but better than a generic one\\n\r\n+ Food, ingredients and utensils look very real and natural\\n\r\n+ Great enviroment and bright, crisp colours\\n\r\n+/- The way they prep the food is very stale and stiff. But with a combination of Talk-overs and epic music, it'll still feel like real work is being done and witnessed\\n\r\n+ Will get you hungry\\n\r\n+/- Ecchi-themed Foodgasms (depends on whether you like ecchi or not. I do)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\n+ Balanced and great OP1\\n\r\n+ Awesome and downright epic OP2\\n\r\n+ Signature-grade background music\\n\r\n- Background music set on repeat for different situations\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n+ Great, interesting and diverse main-characters\\n\r\n+ Refreshing characters\\n\r\n+ Different \"roles\" to different characters\\n\r\n+/- Copy-paste those \"roles\" a bit much on new characters\\n\r\n+/- Reason and motivations on characters are reasonable and motivated rather ok (wut?)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\n+ Worth it\\n\r\n+ Learn yourself a few new food-tricks\\n\r\n+ High Rewatchiblity\\n\\n\r\nAdditional Details:\\n\r\n* Romance?: Well, if there were any, it wasn't shown that greatly\\n\r\n* Gore & Blood?: None at all\\n\r\n* Comedic add-ons?: Quite alot of them and used with great effect and hilarity\\n\r\n* Feel-warning?: If you consider a fist in the air as \"feels\" and hell yeah! The more tear-feels are non-present here. This is a \"feel-good\" anime\\n\r\n* Fan-service?: Served with two dishes: Food and Boobs (censored)\\n\\n\r\nOh, and did I warn you that this show WILL get you hungry? Well, you have been warned three times now...\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you've managed to get this far without immediately spat out this dish of a review  or just headed straight for the \"Not Helpful\" button after having read the intro to this review, I would like to thank you for your time spent on reading this review by basically the most pathetic, average, no-life of an anime-viewer that I am! :)\\n\\n\r\nSo, smack that \"Helpful\" button for me (or for Foodgasms, whatever you prefer) and leave a constructive and productive comment on my profile so I can make better reviews that might fit your taste better :)\\n\\n\r\n- Just your average-everyday anime-viewer\\n\r\n//VoidX",

            "content": "Cooking; one of the hardest genres to make out into an anime (just because animating food is a pain) - I thoroughly enjoyed Shokugeki no Soma. I feel like the story is one of a kind and I love the drama they pour in when the food is being critiqued by a certain person - I also follow the manga very closely, thus, explaining why the score for Story is not that great; the characters develop so much more in the manga which cant be captured in 24 episodes. Personally, I find the art amazing, as I said before, I find food one of thehard things to draw/animate and the food they had in this is amazing (the manga is even better, I highly recommend reading it if you havent already done so!). This anime soundtrack is probably one of the best Ive ever heard; it contains both fun and extremely serious and dramatic orchestra sounds - which I love. Character development wise; it only had 24 episodes and since it follows the manga, it wasnt too much, but there were some obvious characters who developed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved this anime, I read the manga before watching this; so this review is based off someone who read the plot before watching it. The visuals and soundtrack really amazed me and really enhanced the way I thought about Shokugeki no Soma. I highly recommend it for anyone who has a passion for cooking (like I do), you'll be taken for one hell of a ride!",

            "content": "I marathoned season 1 in one day, so maybe that's affecting my review more than it should, but here goes (there are some spoilers, fair warning)...\r\nStory: 6\r\nPredictable, but I guess a food tournament doesn't really need a super inspiring plot. It is what it is. Boy enters food academy chasing after the dream of beating his father. Boy largely succeeds with almost no challenge because the skills his father taught him were basically god tier. My problem with it is once they get to the main tournament it's basically a continuous monotonous stream of judge reactions and food explanations.\r\nArt: 8\r\nPretty good. Never gets sloppy, doesn'trequire a lot of animation so I guess I can't complain. The fanservice bits are a plus I guess.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nHonestly this is where this show should have dumped all its resources into. Megumi seems to be the most developed, and she's sort of likable if you like the super innocent type with self esteem issues. Souma is the stereotypical down-to-earth boy whose biggest challenge is getting second place once or twice (boo hoo?). Erina is the aloof tsundere girl who love/hates Souma (WAY overplayed in this series). Souma establishes the standard \"every girl has a crush on the hero\" relationship with most of the girls in the series, but never really gets to any concrete relationship beyond \"hey you're a friend in need, so I'll cheer you up and help you out but nothing more because cooking is my life!\" Maybe all that changes in the later seasons, but now there's basically no character development beyond Megumi. All in all, they come out okay I guess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nIt's a good show for what it is. There isn't really any emotional investment on the viewer's part to most of the characters. Losses aren't really losses. It's just an exhibition on Souma winning. The comedy is good on about half of the stuff, but once you hit the tournament it's pretty forced.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Not as entertaining as Yakitate Japan, but you can watch it and get some enjoyment.",

            "content": "I finished the 3rd season of Shokugeki last month ahem year and i have to say it was just as awesome as its two predecessors. So, as a commemoration to the heart stopping 3rd season ending and the anticipation of the 4th season, i have decided to give my personal review of all 3 seasons of this show. Welcome to part 1! The beginning of everything, Season 1\r\nI believe that this show needs no introduction, seeing as the hype for it is just ridiculous. But, just for precaution sake, i won't spoil anything about the show in this review. Those who watched it, you knowwhat i'm talking about or what i'm referencing (mostly puns). First timers, newbies, if you haven't watched it, or not sure if you WANT to watch it, just read this. Just do it.\\n\\n\r\nPlot 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nEver had something so delicious, you just wanna moan? Of course you have! No need to lie, it happens to the best of us. Well, that's basically shokugeki in a nutshell. This show is about a boy who enrolls into an elite culinary school full of promising students. However, this isn't any ordinary school. In this school, the students engage in food wars known as Shokugeki, where they compete with each other in terms of their cooking skills, to determine who is superior. So what makes it interesting you might ask? Well, apart from the already interesting plotline, the main selling point of the show lies in its battles and its ecchiness. Yes, that's right. Ecchiness. No... seriously, it wasn't a typo. Let's elaborate more, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nIt's obvious that the battles would be something of a spectacle. But that's not just it either! In each battle since the beginning of the show, they present something more than just plain fights. Whilst battling, they actually elaborate on how each dish is prepared, cooked, and plated, giving some insight on what's actually happening instead of all show and no words. This is a really interesting aspect of the show since it educates you at the same time as instilling a rush of mouth watering anticipation of the food. Besides that, the ferocity between the competitors are no joke. In every battle, you could feel the fierceness and the passion of each character to win that it creates a really tense atmosphere, not just in the arena. It really spices things up ;) \\n\\n\r\nIf the battles weren't enough to sate your appetite,how about some ecchiness? Food wars's success is more than just food battles, it comes from an unexpected mix in a genre of anime that no one would ever expect from a culinary anime show, and that is the ecchiness, which is really one of the main reasons people are drawn to it anyway. The ecchiness stems from the amount of deliciousness the characters get from food, and depicts a wave of uncontrollable sensation you get from eating it. It's as if it is saying that the deliciousness is unbearable that you are completely STRIPPED ;) of your free will and conscience. The varying degree of metaphors is something to be admired as well, showcasing the extensive creativeness of the author.\\n\\n\r\nNot convinced? Here's something else. The first season not just caps out at ecchiness, and battles either. Throughout all 24 episodes, you are slowly brought around the Shokugeki World, from Totsuki Academy, to the Polar Star Dorm, to Totsuki Resort. Everything you experience is something new, from casual fights, to arena battles, to frightening exams, to diner saves. Don't even get me started in the waves of emotions and atmospheres it tosses you through. From the heated battles, to cut up tension to shocking revelations, to unexpected outcomes to peaceful resolutions to tear jerking moments. From the very beginning of the episode, every arc feels different and presents a varying degree of excitement and emotion to you. It was just so satisfying to watch!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art really shines in 2 places. \\n\r\n1. The metaphors - Apart from its creativeness, you can tell it sells when the scene changes and is literally stripped from reality and brought into the world of imagination, and it is at that spot that you begin to feel the grasp of the deliciousness of the food strangling (hehe) at you.\\n\r\n2. The plating of the dishes. Even from the scene changes, you are able to tell that the dishes shine (LITERALLY). The food that is being presented is marked at a different artwork from the rest of the show. You could see that the food served has really intricate designs to show how refined the work was from the chefs. I'd say that's somA dedication (get it? xD)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnother masterpiece! I don't really know how to describe it but let me speak from personal experience. When i first heard the songs from Shokugeki no soma, there were tears...though it didn't fall (yes, i said it). The differing osts sought to escalate an already high tensioned battle into something beyond. There were the battle themes that escalates the hype and the tension of the ongoing battle. And there was the victory theme that just brings tears to your eyes when you hear them. The openings were awesome as well. I mean, Kibou No Uta was such a smooth song. All in all, i LOVED the music. It had everything, from tear strained chokes to fist bumping hype.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the ABSOLUTE BEST PART of the show. Though if you are just watching it for the first time, you may not feel as attached. As i have said in some of my other reviews, there are a few shows that can handle a large roster of characters with care without screwing anything up, and the shows that could, are always shows that are nothing short of masterpieces (usually). Shokugeki no soma has one of the LARGEST roster of characters i've ever seen. So, what makes the Shokugeki characters awesome beyond compare? First of all, the ferocity and passion. This is really what contributes to making the show succeed. In every character, you could sense the passion to fight and never give up, to lose and yet strive on, the ferocity to fight till the end. Each of them has something that drives them, and that drive is what makes them compete so fiercely for the title of Totsuki best. With the story progression, the characters open up more and more, so that you get to know them a lot better. Secondly, their personality. I mean, come on. All of them are entirely lovable. Despite their ferocious battle spirit, they become good friends on the outside of battle. To teach one another and hone their skills and use it against others who have done the same. It's really a bond that is not to be underestimated. Thirdly, their distinctive personality. To top it all off, their personality are so distinctive in ways that they become instantly remembered. For example, Ryo with his sudden cool and sudden violent attitude. So, if they are so awesome, why did i give them an 8? Well, that's because in the first season, the characters did not receive much character backstories and growth development, though they do showcase their skills and abilities in a specific field of culinary arts. Though they do return in the following seasons, that is left to be graded by that season. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's kinda obvious how much i absolutely loved this show, based on how much is written above. I honestly found no flaws to the show and have rewatched it time and time again, and fell more in love with each increasing rewatch. So, go watch it! Seriously!",

Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods.[2][3] Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century.One of the first cars that were accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.",

            "content": "I thought this anime was just a meme before I watched it for myself. As a fantasy junkie, an anime like this breaking into my top 10 is an impossible feat. Of course, Soma-kun could pull it off.\r\nStory - forget about cooking, this story was more intense, dramatic, and gripping than almost any other I've seen. You really have to see it to understand how a show about cooking could be so enthralling. \r\nArt - no CGI, many different styles thrown in for emphasizing different scenes and items, and outstanding execution of all of them. The exceptional animation is one of two reasons why ashow about cooking was able to pull off the intensity that makes it so engaging. The artwork here is the image of perfection.\\n\\n\r\nSound - This is the other reason. Without the soundtrack, it would not have been able to pull off the drama and intensity that it did. In terms of fit and usage, the soundtrack gets perfect marks. However, I have no knock it down a whole three points because of how damn repetitive it is. There are three or four great tracks that fit the scenes perfectly, but they keep playing over and over for the whole series, and it gets annoying after a while.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The animation was flawless, but the characters in this anime exceed perfection. If I could give a higher score than 10, I would. There are so many different characters with detailed backstories and distinctive personalities, and the anime somehow manages to involve every one of them without leaving a single one neglected. To me, having three or four main characters with detailed backstories and good balance is a perfect score. This anime manages to pull off six in one season alone, and that doesn't even include multiple characters of equal or greater importance whose backgrounds have yet to be revealed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - The biggest complaint I have about the anime is the hypersexualized reactions. The first episode contains a literal hentai scene. It was extremely off-putting when I started, and I had to force myself to continue through four episodes, but once things started to pick up I forgot entirely about this reservation. By the end, I didn't even notice how questionable the worst scenes are, because I was so used to them at that point. The anime is so damn good that I forgot all about the incredibly NSFW scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - I'm rewatching this anime at least four times. The first was for entertainment. The second is to take notes, because after finishing this, I felt the need to spend more time in the kitchen myself. The third is to collect the surprisingly detailed recipes, and the fourth is to show it to others. On my own personal list, which is normalized around a mean of 5.5/10, I awarded it an 8... but there are only six entries I've rated higher. I might bump it up to a 9 in future revisions, as my sample size increases, as it's near borderline for me. Putting my normalized personalized ratings aside, on a more universal scale, this is closer to a 9.5. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I typically do not go into new anime shows with any sort of expectation mainly because it would limit my perspective of the show. A lot of talk about food wars went around and it was time that I watched the show. However, Food wars is not an exception to the expectation rule I use. As with any show that I start with, I am always looking forward to an enjoyable show until it comes down to whether I decide to write a review on it. Food wars happened to be within this criteria and was very enjoyable to watch, yet there were many lackingelements to the show. \\n\\n\r\nThere were many ways to interpret the story of the show. Ranges from guy who wants to be the best chef for the sake of being the best to guy who is looking to be the best to surpass a role model of his. I decided to interpret it as the latter and it overall lead me to believe that the show had a really vague conclusion. In hindsight, the show didn't seem to follow a linear story line, rather focus on the lot of characters that we are introduced to. However the intended interpretation was of this anime, it was executed nicely with detailed script. It was like watching one of those reality tv food shows where competitors are shown capabilities on the outside while delving into the philosophical elements of them as well. Well done story line even though there wasn't an overlying climax to look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest fall of this show were the characters. I try not to compare anime within reviews but I felt that there was a big flaw within the show that another show had. After some cooking scenes, we get to see a snippet of a character's backstory as to why and how they learned to cook the way they do. Is this what it means to give meaning to a character and make us give a damn about them? I do not think so, this is what I call the Akame ga Kill! effect. It is cool to learn about the character's through their past, but if its just for a moment and is disregarded towards the end of the show, then its meaningless. Even our main protagonist is not interesting, he sorta gives off the tatsuya vibe from Mahouka. Being the phenomenal star of the academy, lots of competition involving him does not provide the feeling of suspense, because one way or another due to plot convenience, he will come out on top. He does have redeeming qualities though, pretty much defying all the shounen type protagonist we see in shows lately. Arrogant, confident, and funny to boot. \\n\r\nAlso the focus of characters seem to shift wildly. The first few episodes gives off a feeling that the chick on the front of the cover photo for the show is our main antagonist, but shes just plot armor'd to no avail. Then we have the shining gem of the show, another effect I like to call the Megumi effect. Seems in some anime I watch, the Megumi girl is always the most developed and the shine of the show. She seemed to have most of the screen time above all other characters besides the protagonist. It was certainly a breath of fresh air watching her because she stands out from the crowd of professional heir's, being borderline failure and timid at that. By the end of the show, she really is something and the best characterized character of the show by far. All the other characters suffer the akame ga kill effect and are really not memorable. There were interesting qualities in some of them, but they dont expand upon them like they did with Megumi.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation; oh boy. This a mixed bag for me because while the food looks very appealing and detailed, the ecchi scenes were just out of place and over the top. The biggest problem with these foodgasm scenes is that they take up so much screen time and are really drawn out to the point its just a nuisance and obnoxious. Yes the food is good, all the side characters with different colored hair are going to have good food. We don't need 3 minutes of screen time of them orgasming over it. It really took away from the feeling of achievement you get when you see a character succeed. However, I really love the miniature figures of characters in comedic scenes and the white eyes. I seem to have a guilty pleasure for that type of animation and it fit the script when it was used. But the drawn out scenes of glorifying the food was a no no for me, after the first 5 episodes I was no longer able to stomach it. \\n\\n\r\nSound is forgettable. Both openings are mediocre and the 2nd ED was as well. However, the first ED is by far one of my favorite ED's out there in anime, and I believe that most people tend to only remember openings rather than endings. This one was able to catch my attention and was unskippable for me. Soundtrack wasn't memorable at all. The supposed suspense filled scenes didn't have any music which was a bonus since that's what makes it suspenseful. Besides the recycled instrumental theme of the ED/OP's, soundtrack was mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a very fun watch. I applaud the writer of the show since it was very informative, bar some unrealistic traits to some cooked meals. Character interactions are funny and story is good. Lack of tension limited the story though since the main protagonist was really strong. Many characters were one dimensional, many were disregarded, and u think a 24 episode series would justify having well developed characters but even throughout the show, new characters just kept popping up and making prior ones even more forgetful. Animation is a hit or miss for viewers, miss for me. But despite all of it, I recommend watching it since its addictive. Who doesn't like watching the production of food?! \\n\\n\r\nmegumi wifey material :)\\n\\n",

It's cool after the first time but after the 50th it gets tiring. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all I loved this anime watched it in a weekend and would have given it the nine it rightfully deserves had it not been for the final episodes dragging out a little bit too much.",

            "content": "Ah yes, Shokugeki no Souma. An anime set in a magical world where apparently the food is SO good that everyone's clothes spontaneously disintegrate and they appear to climax. (No for real, I'm not kidding, this actually happens very frequently during the food judging segments)\r\nAll that aside, Shokugeki no Soma (Food Wars!) is an extremely well-executed anime from a genre that I like to call \"a bunch of talented people doing talented things.\"\r\nThe setting puts the audience in a world-class, elite culinary high school: Totsuki. An institution which is as famous for its alumni as it is notorius for its insanely difficult curriculum. The competitionhere is cutthroat, and students can be dismissed for the slightest mistake. The students are faced with constant, overwhelming adversity that would break the souls of the faint of heart. It becomes very clear that these guys are here not only to learn, but to prove themselves as the very best in the field of culinary arts. The environment establishes a sense of what is at stake very well, and you feel a genuine thrill/tension as you root for the characters throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut here is where we run into potential problems with the \"a bunch of talented people doing talented things\" genre anime. Because of the nature of the show, talent is literally EVERYWHERE. Everyone is VERY good at what they do. Shokugeki no Souma is no exception. When you have everyone good at what they do it becomes extraordinarily difficult for anyone to really stand out. Thankfully Food Wars does not suffer from this issue. Due to the diverse nature of culinary arts, each character has a separate and distinct style of cooking, and I found almost all of them entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really helped this show stand out was the strong emphasis on just how much cooking meant to these kids. Some just want to prove themselves. Some want to make their parents proud. Some are doing it for giggles. Whatever the reason, these kids pour their heart and soul into every single thing they do not because they have to, but because they want to. There is an enormous amount of attention to detail, effort, and applied skill that goes into every dish, and it is an absolute blast to see unfold. It not only helps you emotionally invest in the characters, but also helps broaden your appreciation of the activity these kids love so dearly.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn't to say that Food Wars is without fault however. There is elements of harem that get shoehorned into the series. Almost every single female in this show falls for the main character, and as usual, the main character doesn't give a single care. It felt forced, out of place, and ultimately unnecessary in a show that's all about competition between students.\\n\\n\r\nSolid Show with a few flaws. Definitely recommended.",

Now imagine that all of the foods have naked women around them. Welcome to Shokugeki no Souma. \r\nStory: 8\r\nAlthough not many anime focus on just food and cooking, there are still a few out there. The big question about Shokugeki no Souma is whether it differentiates itself from those other anime. \r\nYes. Shokugeki no Souma takes a look upon the world of competitive cooking. Unlike many other causal cooking anime, Shokugeki no souma likes to highlight the stress of competition. Howcompetition can change a person, how people adjust during time of stress, and what it means to reach a goal in such a do or die situation. The excitement created by this will entice an audience, making them more interested in the outcome of the character's struggles.\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art of Shokugeki no Souma is very good. As it is a newer anime, the quality of art is to be expected. However, Shokugeki no Souma is a show that will always make you want to eat. The food is animated beautifully and really highlights the fact that the anime is about cooking.\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe music is okay. Not bad by any means, but is unable to add the level of excitement that the show likes to create. That being said, it still does its job.\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nThis is where the anime really drops in quality. The anime is full of stock characters. (In literature stock characters are pretty much characters that are generic, cut and paste, and easily replaceable.) Many side characters in the anime are too bland and plot driven. The only one who really is highlighted is Souma. Despite this, the anime has shown little of what makes a character great. Change. The anime's cast of character has too little change. This really hurts how much you can really get invested into the anime itself.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI have a confession. I enjoyed the shit out of Shokugeki no Souma. The way that they highlighted competition really can put an audience on the edge. Despite many underwhelming aspects of the anime, it still has a little bit of comedy, that while feels out of place, can really set in a casual tone. This creates a big disparity in terms of excitement and makes the competitions more epic. \\n\r\nOverall: B -\\n\r\nThe aspects of Shokugeki no Souma average 8.0. That is indeed a B minus. The show is certainly enjoyable. Putting aside the ecchi that the show includes, it manages to really be exciting. The music and art really add onto this recipe for success as well. Certainly a good watch if you want to be invested into something very exciting and interesting.",

            "content": "If cooking is porn, are pizzas prostitutes?\r\nStory:\r\nIf you\u2019ve ever seen a battle shounen you pretty much know what you can expect from Food Wars. The only difference is that the characters cook instead of fighting. Even though that sounds like the lamest concept ever, it works surprisingly well. Instead of specific fighting styles they have different styles of cooking, which is something that allows for a far bigger variety than punching faces ever could. After watching the first season I kind of wonder why nobody else thought of this before. Well, there is Toriko, but that\u2019s not exactly the same. The idea of cooking battlesis as genius as it is simple. The show is able to play all the usual tropes straight but have them feel fresh because of how they are presented. You have the hyper-talented underdog protagonist, the top level jerkass rival our hero wants to beat, the greatest generation ever, a tournament arc, and so on and so on. The gimmick to lure in viewers are the infamous foodgasms, which I could have done without, but hey, it attracts viewers so why not. They kept them at an acceptable level though. However, as good as Food Wars is at playing the shounen genre straight with its different approach, it has one flaw that can make the show tiresome at some points. The cooking duels can\u2019t have much of a variety in terms of how they are structured. People cook, judges eat, they rate. This is especially noticeable near the end when dozens of characters have their food rated in the Autumn Elections. There is only so much you can do with judges saying how truly great that stuff it before you wish they would just go on already. For now, that is a neglectable minor problem, but it could prove crucial in future seasons. While we\u2019re at the subject of seasons, I hate cliffhanger endings and sadly, Food Wars has one. It ends after the preliminaries, before the knock out stage of the tournament.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe term food porn that has been attached to Food Wars is not only because all the hot chicks get naked and cum every time they eat something yummy, but also because of how good the food looks (you know, the original use of the term). It\u2019s hard to watch this anime and not get hungry, so you might want to postpone watching until after your diet. Since I am as skilled at cooking as an amputated monkey, I have no idea how true to original the dishes are, but for me, they look convincing. The characters all have a unique look, which is a necessity for a huge cast, and they look pretty good. The animation is somewhat mediocre at times, but definitely above the line of minimum requirement.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe first opening song isn\u2019t really anything special, but it is somewhat catchy, I give it that. Same goes for the first ending song as well. I did not care about the second opening or ending, they were pretty forgettable to me. The voice actors are all very solid, but nobody stands out in my opinion. That\u2019s not a bad thing, most of the characters fall into stereotypes anyway, so it\u2019s well enough they sound accordingly. The cooking sound effects were pretty good and added to that damn hunger building up while watching. In terms of sound, Food Wars is a solid production without any remarkable highs or lows.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe cast of Food Wars is big and colorful, not only in visuals but also in personality. Sure, none of them are incredibly creative or groundbreaking in any way, but much like all the shounen story stereotypes, they work in this environment. I would even go so far as to say the fact that they are mostly stock characters makes them more likeable in general. In some cases, the standards were tweaked a little to make them feel less unoriginal, like with the protagonist Souma. He is as competitive and wholesome as you would expect, but he is a lot less cocky and brash, something I am incredibly thankful for. In addition to that, he loves to snark around from time to time, again making him feel way less obnoxious as other shounen leads.\\n\r\nHowever, I was not very happy with Erina as the obvious girl-the-hero-will-end-up-with. I have seen far too many tsunderes in anime and they are always the major love interests, repeating the same boring, unfunny jokes over and over and over again. I especially dislike when the writers kinda forget about the whole dere part, which is kind of the whole point of the archetype. As the show isn\u2019t over yet, I can obviously not tell what the creators have in mind with Erina, but by the impression I got during season one, I can safely say that she is a shitty written character. Again, I may be proven utterly wrong later on, but that is what I see here.\\n\r\nNikumi is a much better tsundere (and a more classic approach too). I enjoyed the femme fatale/tomboy mix up they tried with her, adding timidity towards Souma on top of that. She\u2019s like a cool, unique Frankenstein monster of stereotypes. Wait, doesn\u2019t this already qualify as\u2026gasp\u2026realistic? Let\u2019s move on to my favourite stock character, the shrinking violet. Megumi is great at that, being the hard-working, backbone-less sunshine. Unlike others of her kind, she gets to showcase her talents on multiple occasions, which creates a nice feel good moment for the viewer. I constantly had the urge to cuddle her, so I\u2019d say she worked exactly like she was supposed to (though I\u2019m easy to bait with these characters).\\n\r\nLet me cut myself short here and let me summarize the cast as a whole, otherwise we\u2019ll be here next Tuesday. Almost all characters are either unique or well done variations of known archetypes and most of them are likeable. They also all have at least a short time with the spotlights on themselves, which prevents them from feeling like a waste of time when they don\u2019t add anything to the scene or current plotline. For a shounen, the cast is very good.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nFood Wars was a surprisingly entertaining anime, that kept its flow going and I never grew tired of it until the very end, when the whole episode was just judges praising the food. I usually don\u2019t like shounen very much as almost all of them follow the same basics over and over again. This show does it too, but with the little twist of turning the whole thing into cooking, it made itself feel fresh. Most of its flaws are small and neglectable and the fanservice tolerable (though this may be a different story if you have a general aversion towards this). As with many other shows, the question is how long it can keep up the good work, but for the first season, I can say that it was quite enjoyable.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n8.2/10",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Soma was an interesting journey for me. It tells the story of a young boy aspiring to be a chef that is worthy of the Yukihara diner, but thats not all it's about, it also tells the story of other individually unique chefs facing the same challenges using their own style of doing things.\r\nStory-8/10\r\n  The story contained many elements of Shounen, but like some of the superb dishes in the show, they didn't let the heat of battle and the boil of blood dominate the mood of the whole show. Despite there being moments that got me pumped up, there were alsomoments that reached out to me and situations where it was possible for me to relate to. I'm sure that most of us hate to lose like Soma and use it as a way to improve just like him but there are also times where you find it hard to pick yourself up or times where you feel like someone else is stealing the show completely. This anime makes room for all of those feelings, not much room for it but it is mentioned. Admittedly there wasn't enough episodes to let everyone shine as a person but it did very well to not put all the focus on Soma despite being a shounen series. I really enjoyed this show, personally it brings some drive back into my life and makes me fight harder for those who don't manage to shine as brightly.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8/10\\n\r\n  I really enjoyed the art in Shokugeki no Soma, having read the manga which had superbly detailed art especially when it came to the food, the anime's art did not disappoint. However the art just isn't as detailed on the food and the characters definitely looked cooler when it was enhanced by shading.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7/10\\n\r\n The first opening and ending theme songs were amazing, the opening song would always get me pumped up for each episode and the ending would leave me feeling warm in the heart making it feel like a good day just concluded, this was further enhanced by the animation for the ending theme where everyone repeated the same motions, it just somehow felt very welcoming. However i could not get myself to enjoy the second opening or ending song, not because it was bad in anyway but because it could not compare to the mood created by the first. The music used in the show was mediocre, doing what it needs to, making you feel fired up when they wanted you to but nothing really stood out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-9/10\\n\r\n  Each character was unique and begged to be noticed. Throughout the whole show, I was interested in everyone and not only Soma. The anime did well to ensure characters were 3D and not just support for the main characters. They all had a story to tell, however sadly was not told very well in the anime. I loved every character in the show and for the stories of the characters that were told, they all taught a good lesson and none were dull to say at the very least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9/10\\n\r\n  It's a great show, whether you're looking for heated battles, a slice of life, or inspiration, Shokugeki no Soma will help out in some way. Despite not knowing anything close to cooking, it managed to pull me in and leave me wanting more.",

Food Wars is spectacular in nearly every aspect, especially coming from someone who wasn't familiar with this anime at all before.\r\nThe first episode is always the magnet or the repellent when it comes to the draw of the anime, now obviously it was a magnet for myself but I couldn't help but think it could be an easy repellent for people who did not knowwhat they were getting into. To anyone who's seen at least the first episode, you know what scene I'm talking about, as well as to anyone who is going to watch it, you'll know when you see it but if that is a repellent to you, that's the worst it will get as far as that goes but anyway! \\n\r\nFrom beginning to end, Food Wars! drawn me in from the beautiful animation to the memorable characters. Also, by the way, the characters from main to side, are ALL memorable, Food Wars! gives every character a unique trait or so to make everyone unforgettable.\\n\r\nThe culinary environment of the anime was also a big draw because as far as I know, I haven't seen an anime that's used cooking for it's draw and it works, because like the characters in this anime, you CAN and/or WILL get turned on by the food in this anime just by looking at it! \\n\r\nNow, the coloring of Food Wars! is something in itself to talk about. There is soo much color in this anime, from the food, to the environment, to the characters. So much beautiful color in this anime, So much!\\n\r\nNow please do not think that I'm creating this review of Food Wars just to splurge how great it is, but... I honestly did not see anything that disliked in this anime. The environment of culinary art mixed in with various, yet memorable characters with great animation full of vibrant colors and sound makes the overall enjoyment something you won't forget.",

So Worth watching and rewatching.\r\nStory 8\r\nArt 9+\r\nSound 9\r\nCharacter 9\r\nEnjoyment 10\r\nOverall 9+\r\nTo my surprise this anime was way better than I had expected. How to make an awesome anime, you need:\r\n- 1 superb cool protagonist with astonishing skills\r\n- two dozen pair of boobs and booties\r\n- 5 spoons of comedic value\r\n- 1 spoon of exaggeratedness that leaves you cringing sometimes (oh god     Isshiki-senpai)\r\n- 1 tsundere heroine\r\n- a bunch of enemies and allys with distinctive features and skills\r\n- a bit of awesomeness\r\n- and just a tiny pinch of ecchiness, oh fk, the whole pervy container fell in \r\nthe pot\r\n- a disgustingtasting feature that methaphorically rapes your taste buds\\n\r\n- and of course the obligatory potato, because internet\\n\\n\r\nNow let it simmer slowly until it gets smooth and mellow.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEach and every episode of this epitome of food porn anime is magnificent. Watching it leaves you drooling waterfalls over this out-of-this-world looking food.\\n\r\nNever ever watch it while you're hungry or you will suffer like I did. To be honest, after watching the karaage (friend chicken) episode I could not help but eating nuggets until I finally made my own karaage. \\n\\n\r\nOther than the food art the foodgasm moments were depicted highly creative, even featuring fighting scenes using their cooking utensils. \\n\r\nSoma and his knife reminds me of Ichigo and his Zangetsu (Bleach).\\n\\n\r\nThe cook-offs are extremely tension filled and are accompanied by their matching musical piece. \\n\r\nIt contains laughter, emotions, goosebump, char development and fits everyone's taste. Absolutely enjoyable and I recommend it to every anime lover who likes cooking or food (who doesn't like food).\\n\\n\r\nThe explanation of the cooking methods and effects sound very profound. \\n\r\nI have to say though that it kinda got boring in the last 2 episodes because each of them were formidable cooks and hearing the judges explain the awesomeness of 10 dishes one after another is kinda dragging. Also how did they shove in so much food but whatever. You don't wet yourself and come while tasting food either. Reality aside, it's entertaining value outshines the irrationality. \\n\\n\r\nAs for myself, who considers himself a hobby cook, the presented dishes just make you want to recreate them and you can learn a thing or two by watching Shokugeki, an educaitonal plus. \\n\\n\r\nMinus points could be the predictable outcomes of the battles. But my inner flamb\u00e9 fire burns in anticipation of the 2nd season where the elites will clash with each other. And as already mentioned the explanations of the dishes, which are  detailed for main characters and shallow for others. \\n\\n\r\nBtw there are enough in-depth recipes on how to cook all the meals shown in the anime if you're interested. Just google.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

There's really no in-between. I've found that those who've read the manga, don't like it, but those who've only watched the anime tend to love it. I'm the latter of the two. \r\nStory: 9\r\nThe plot is interesting, it may not start out very well in the beginning, a guy wanting to grow up and own the family business is pretty standard, but the story takes a turn and itevolves from there. Introducing different things, new plots and new characters, but still has the same overall idea. There's competition and tension that keeps you rooted to your seat. I would've finished this anime in a day if it weren't for my busy life, but even when I wasn't watching it, I kept going back and thinking \"What's going to happen next?\" and I'm so disappointed that there isn't more yet.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good, it fits the anime. It's actually pretty amazing, the range of colors, the variety of faces and hair, but I wouldn't give it a 10. Still, it's pretty high up there.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nI don't pay much attention to the music, I liked the first opening the best, but other than that, I don't really have much to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nThere's not too much character development with most of the characters, there's some, but it's subtle, you won't see it unless you're specifically looking for it. Most notables in this area are Todokara Megumi, but it takes awhile to fully see her grow, and another would be the main character: Yukihira Soma, although, sometimes it doesn't seem like it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nIt was fun and hilarious watching this, even if there's competition and seriousness, there's also a vast amount of humor and of course, fan-service. Oh, the fan-service, some of it is almost eye-twitching, but a lot of it's just plain funny. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a great mix of fun and serious. I would definitely recommend watching it. I loved watching it and I'm seriously thinking about just re-watching this again. And, it's about food, how could I not love it? Although, after watching this, I'm a little disappointed with eating my own food, I want gourmet food now, too.",

The art is the main attraction to this anime (for me), the food looks very detailed and delicious (so don't watch this anime on an empty stomach)! The sound is great, good voice acting and the sounds of the knives cutting food are great. The characters are a spotlight, very fun and hilarious faces (definitely got q Fullmetal Alchemist humor type of vibe). The enjoyment I had from watching this anime can only be described as \"I bingedthe entire season in 3 days\". That's how much enjoyment I got out of it. Overall I would recommend this anime, it did not disappoint. The comedy plays a big role but it can get serious at a moments notice (while still retaining some humor) to keep things fun.",

            "content": "SUMMARY\r\n-Shonen elements are typical; fairly well-executed\r\n-Lots of fanservice (not really the point of the show, but it's definitely still there)\r\n-Good, interesting, detailed writing about food and cooking food\r\n-Very good, clean, attractive art; good character designs\r\n-OP/ED themes are meh; tracks in episodes are good and exciting; very good voice acting; good sound effects for food and \"action\"\r\n-Enjoyment will vary greatly with the viewer, depending on preferences regarding fanservice, plot progression, resolved ending, and interest in the subject matter (cooking, food)\r\n-Overall very solid and well-made anime; definitely better than your average throwaway junk anime that clutters the seasonal rosters regularly\r\n-Widely watched show; important to know/watch if youcare about being conversant in popular anime\\n\\n\r\nFULL REVIEW\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\\n\r\nThis is a shonen show about cooking.  Main character goes to school to learn about cooking.  Makes friends.  Learns about cooking.  Has \"battles\" based around cooking.  You get to see the characters grow and mature.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have a particular interest in cooking or food, this show will probably interest you with the writing alone.  There are plenty of distraction, like fanservice and whatnot, but the actual writing about the cooking is very solid.  Sometimes, it goes so fast that it seems like the writers don't expect you to keep up.  Nonetheless, it's clear that the writer/original mangaka is very knowledgeable on the subject of food and cooking.  You will learn a lot if you pay attention and try to keep up.  You might even find some recipes in the show that you want to try for yourself.  I was able to find a video recipe on YouTube where someone makes a dish that appears in the show.  Pretty cool stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is over the top in many regards.  If you like stuff like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, or FLCL, or Kill la Kill, then this show probably has your style of humor and entertainment.  \\n\\n\r\nThe setting is interesting.  Elite cooking school with many interesting characters.  The main character must survive (not get expelled) and compete for prestige among his peers in the various contests involved in the educational curriculum at the school.  The setting isn't super well-developed, though.  Not a ton of world-building.  This show is mostly character-driven, \"battle\"-driven, and to some extent food-info-dump driven.\\n\\n\r\n**Important**\\n\r\nThe story does not conclude with this season.  There is going to be a season 2.  Season 1 ends at the end of an arc, but many questions are left unanswered.  Not really any resolution for the characters.  Some people might not like this, but it's a pretty standard way to do anime these days.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\\n\r\nJ.C. Staff is the studio.  Very colorful art.  Very visually appealing character designs; many of the characters have interesting visual distinguishing features.  The animation gets decently fluid in the \"action\" scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of visual metaphor in this show.  There are what's known as \"foodgasms\"; people react *very* pleasurably to eating food in this show.  This is where much of the fanservice comes in.  Fair warning: this has the potential to be awkward when watching with others.  Be sure that anyone watching with you is fully aware of Japanese anime culture and how sexualized characters in anime can be at times.  If you have a liberal sense of humor, this probably worn't bother you.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style shifts at times during comedic scenes.  Some chibi and whatnot.\\n\\n\r\nI thought about giving this category a 10 since I can't think of what more I would want or expect from a show in terms of art.  It's hard to have high standards knowing how the industry works.  I'm happy that I can see shows with this much quality, knowing how busy people in the industry are.  Nonetheless, I guess I'll just leave it at a 9 since I have seen better.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nThere are some interesting and exciting tracks used regularly throughout the show, which are successful in making me feel hype for the food battles.  The opening and ending themes are probably forgettable for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the voice acting.  Every character made sense.  They did a good job.  No complaints, but I'm not going to write home about it, either.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of good sound effects for the food.  It helps bring the meals to life, as much as the visuals.  Very well done in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\\n\r\nLots of interesting characters.  Souma works fine as a main character.  He's likable.  Many characters fit some cliches, though they are executed well.  Erina-tsundere with mostly tsun.  Megumi-nice, friendly, likable, \"traditional\" kind of girl.  There's the cool dad who the main character is chasing (in cooking skill).\\n\\n\r\nLarge array of supporting characters.  Perhaps too many.  But most of them are still interesting.  Many of them have time to get a decent back story.  Nothing amazing; you won't be crying over anything (in all likelihood).  But it's enough to get you interested in the cast and what they are all doing.  It's a character driven shonen, but it's not serious character drama (at least, not in this season).  You watch this show for the characters having fun and interesting battles, and for developing the power of friendship.  Not for serious drama.  There are some characters with touching backstories, but these usually fit into a time span of 10 minutes.  So it's not like real serious drama with a long build up and payoff.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\\n\r\nThis will vary greatly.  It depends on what you want and what you can tolerate.  Enjoyment will be greatly diminished if you don't like fanservice.  There is a lot of irreverent humor that goes along with the fanservice.  You have to be able to enjoy that to really enjoy this show.  It's one of the main selling points.  If you can enjoy over the top humor, with a bit (or a decent amount) of fanservice thrown in, then you will greatly enjoy this show.  This can be really fun and funny if it doesn't put you off.\\n\\n\r\nYou have to get investing in the cooking to some degree.  Many episodes have long expositions about how a meal was made.  If you can't enjoy that, you won't be able to consistently enjoy this show.\\n\\n\r\nThere are standard shonen elements of battle and friendship and the pursuit of skill and greatness.  You've got to be able to enjoy this stuff for this show.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes can get a bit repetitive.  After a while, people getting excited about a dish can seem overdone.  They do a good job of keeping it fresh, mostly, all things considered.  If I knew more about food and what people were saying during exposition, it probably wouldn't feel repetitive.  But for the layman who wants the plot to progress, all of the talk about food might feel slow or hard to understand, and thus feel repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\\n\r\nThis is a solid show that clearly had above-average effort put into making it.  The show made me want to binge-watch it, which for me is a sign of one of the better shows of a particular year.  It left me wanting more, which is a good sign for the quality, but also it was bittersweet due to the full story not being adapted yet.  We'll have to see how far season 2 takes us (season 2 will be coming out in summer 2016).",

            "content": "What better thing to do at night than to stay up to about 12 watching anime, especially one about food? \r\n(LONG REVIEW!)\r\nI honestly love the story. One of my favourite stories out there, though I have not seen that much anime. If you're going to be thinking of boring people cooking boring food, then you are very wrong. The story isn't fast paced, nor did it drag out. It told you the story in visual form and not being repetitive. Not only that, but it always ends in an interesting note, so that they want you to keep watching, ignoring the fact that maybe youhave somewhere to go to or maybe you're staying up late. The story was linked up and no bullshit or fillers were made up on the spot. Romance in a food competition sounds very unlikely, but this anime succeeded in doing it. You would think that once there's romance in a competition that it would lose its \"exciting-ness\", because it would start wandering off the story and being focused more on the relationship between the couple. The romance adds spice to the story, making it more interesting and so that the main character isn't all lonely. Speaking of romance, it wasn't hinted out that much but yes there is a harem, and one with a childhood friend-type of thing. To me, there's nothing wrong with that but that's really clich\u00e9. The childhood friend relationship has been used in a lot of romance anime and it does get tiring, though it doesn't affect the story that much. My favorite out of the rest is the action. Everytime there's an action scene involving Soma, it always gives me goosebumps. The fact that even though he isn't a rich kid who comes from a wealthy background, but a middle-class family and still have the talent of cooking to the level of a world class chef, somehow gives me goosebumps. Anyways, enough about the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that struck my mind and gave me a puzzling look was that the illustrator of the anime was actually someone who was very used to ecchi-type drawings. I liked the fact that he used that talent in a different atmosphere with less ecchi. The art was amazing and the food, even though it's an animation, still made me hungry. The bright colours and the smooth coloring and drawings contributed to that. I'm quite happy that the eyes aren't the size of a planet, unlike some anime. Some people like it, but personally I don't. The one funny thing I love about the art is the emotions in some people's faces. It can get pretty funny.\\n\\n\r\nSound was one of the main contributes to why I get goosebumps in some scenes. You want an epic scene? Let's throw in an epic OST. You want a sad scene? Let's throw in a sad piano OST. I also liked the orchestral voices in the anime, showing some class instead of metal, which I have no problem with. I also loved the fact that the voice actor they used for Soma was Sora, from No Game No Life (a very successful anime). He voice-acts some of my favorite male characters, because the character he voice-acts as is very cool.\\n\\n\r\nYukihira Soma is a very supportive and hardworking character. If you thought serving over 200 to customers under half an hour was impossible, to Soma, it isn't. The others admire him as he is what influences them to be stronger and mentally capable of what's around them. He is very smart and efficient, as shown on how he demonstrates the fact that he used honey to tenderise the beef. He isn't the type to think the once you're strong, you can't get stronger. Everytime he gets better at cooking, he focuses on what he needs to do to improve. The other side to him is his dumb yet funny personality. If you have heard of Yoshi Akihisa (from Baka to Test), that stupidity is quite similar to Soma's. It doesn't get annoying, but it becomes tolerable to the point that you want to see more of that side to him. Other characters that are an honourable mention are Saiba Jouichiro (the dad of Soma) who is a very friendly dad and is Soma's goal to surpass him. Very similar to Soma, except older and now more mature. Tadokoro Megumi, a very humble and kind girl. He used to dislike Soma, because she thought that he would only be a nuisance in becoming a good chef, but she thought wrong and became his partner in climbing the ladders to becoming a good chef. Nakiri Erina, aka Gods Tongue, because of the fact that as a baby her palette only accepted the best of the best types of foods. She always thinks high of herself, but I think she might have a crush on Soma.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime too much. I would stay up until 1 watching this anime. Every episode, I would tell myself that it would be the last one I watch but it just drags me in. The reactions from the taste testers were pretty funny, as they are not just normal reactions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a 9/10. I can't give my full opinion on this anime yet, as it is just in its first season and a second season might be released around summer 2016. Would I rewatch the first season again? Definitely!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

He will have to graduate the elite school to surpass his father. The overview of the story is pretty cliche but the twist and turns ofit is really surprising. I dont get how people can say its \"predictable\",  he loses some of the major fights, and even if he wins, he would do it in an unexpected and creative way, it really does remind me of Kaiji.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nIts pretty decent, its a cooking anime it isnt OPM so dont expect Madhouse quality animation but its still decent, the detail they put into the art of the food is amazingly detailed though\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nI love the first ending\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing amazing but it fits in nicely \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nThis is where people might get butthurt\\n\\n\r\nSouma\\n\r\nNow unlike many other Shounen MCs, hes not OP, hes skilled but he isnt a GOD. He loses some of the fights, and even has rivals/peers that are on equal strength. He has traits that other mainstream MCs have which include, being totally absent minded, carefree, daring, not giving up even once etc. And because he loses, he evolves and grows in cooking, although in the anime he doesnt really evolve as a character. (For that you will have to read the (manga) or season 2). \\n\\n\r\nTadokoro\\n\r\nFairly stereorypical but lovable asf \\n\r\nShes cute as hell and develops the most in terms of character\\n\r\nShe starts off timid but as she gets to know Soma, she starts to gain confidence in herself and in her cooking. \\n\\n\r\nNakiri Erina\\n\r\nIn the anime, shes basically a side charac (screen time problem), even though shes supposed to be a main charac, which I dont mind \\n\r\n(Shell get proper development/show time in the manga or in season 3 (if there is gonna be one)\\n\r\nShes a tsun with a GOD TONGUE which only makes things worse\\n\r\nShe hates Soma because his cooking is too \"free\" or \"for the masses\" and not gourmet enough for an elite school like Tootsuki\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nI enjoy it because you can relate and put yourself in the story\\n\r\nWhen Soma loses, Id feel frustrated. Because he puts alot of effort into his cooking and he would lose at some of the most unexpected moments.\\n\r\nBut at the end of the day, he would always find a way to defeat his opponents. And you cant help but admire his tenacity. It truly is a shounen that is worth enjoying.",

            "content": "After hearing about this show from multiple people, I decided to give it a shot. I've actually read the first couple volumes of the manga so I kind of knew what to expect coming in. Honestly, I probably should have just read the manga instead since it would have been much faster and maybe more enjoyable.\r\nArt\r\nLet's start with the positives. The animation for this show looks amazing. Not the best I've seen but definitely up there and deserving of an 8/10 rating. The way the animators made the food shine really impressed me and if I were fast-forwarding through this (which I kind of didtowards the end), I would still pause at the moment each dish is first introduced.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe songs are also pretty good. I wasn't a fan of the second opening but the rest were pretty decent in an above average listen-on-youtube-every-once-in-a-while kind of way. There were also a couple of recognizable recurring themes that would come up in the middle of the show so overall the sound was pretty well-done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nI liked that there were a lot of characters and they're pretty easily distinguishable. You could easily tell that a character would be at least somewhat important based on what they're wearing (the normal students all look the same otherwise and actually wear the uniforms). I guess this is a common thing but I kind of appreciate it. I also like that each character has a specialty (hey it's the rice wine chick!) because I definitely didn't know a lot of their names until the end.\\n\\n\r\nI originally was going to give characters a 6 or 7 rating but the more I think about it the more I realized that might be a little high. I was pretty annoyed that every character in the show just wants to be the very best (\"I'm coming for that #1 spot!\"). Success doesn't have to come this way. Sure, no one wants to be bad at things but some variety would be nice at least. Also, none of the characters went through any sort of growth except for maybe Megumi, our female co-protagonist. I don't think it'd be too controversial to say this is not a character-driven show.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe ideas are there, with the camp and the Autumn Elections. However, the execution for the last couple of episodes was pretty terrible in my opinion. It was the same shit for so many different people. They introduced characters that did nothing for the rest of the show save to present a dish at the Autumn Election like the girl who made chinese food. Sure, there might be payoffs later but this is not the right way to introduce a character. I ended up fastforwarding through the last two-three episode just to see the scores for each student and the food that they made. It's like watching Master Chef except all the reviews are good  (which, if you've seen master chef, the best parts are when the judges shit all over the food) and it's just boring and hard to watch. This is a shame because I enjoyed how they introduced different parts of the world earlier in the season (training camp, different clubs, different dorms, etc).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis 7/10 pretty much comes from reaction/over-reaction chibi shots. I'm just a sucker for them and they always make me laugh. This show had no shortages of reaction shots which was great.\\n\\n\r\nThe food orgasms were pretty annoying. I prefer the real thing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/TLDR\\n\r\nFunny, original show with great visual, good sound, a meh story and memorable-but-don't-do-much characters. I don't hate my self for having spent the time to watch this show's first season but I will not be watching the second season. Too many other animes out there to watch still!\\n",

            "content": "Food Wars: A shounen anime that's tryna get me hyped for food and has tons of fanservice for everyone that's so extreme that it honestly seems to be making fun of fanservice by including it.  \r\nShould you watch it?  lol yes. \r\nStory: \r\nAii, so the best way to think about Food Wars is to think about it like a Sports anime.  It's predictable.  You're in it for easy-to-understand character archetypes, humor, over-the-top everything that will get you hyped for the topic at hand (in this case, cooking), and more often than not, an over-powered lovable protagonist that will have his ownproblems in other departments other than his skills.  What this anime does, like many other anime out there, is dismiss the idea that people of a lower class can bring amazing results, and that's a common theme throughout the show that I don't mind spoiling for you just because it's so obvious.  The protagonist Souma is a seemingly lower class child chef from a diner in a bourgeoisie culinary world, and the height of the tension in this show comes from the Pleb Souma showing that he's just as good, if not better, than the high class students that try to oppose him.  The plot is endearing and inspiring, no matter how overpowered Souma may be.  While the story may be predictable or whatever, calm down.  It's a shounen *sports* anime at heart, so of course it's gonna be predictable.  It's pretty good at what it does though. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty looking. the food looks GODLIKE, and the fanservice is hilariously detailed, looking as if it came out of a fucking high budget hentai or some shit.  It's hilarious and universal, so ladies and gay gentlemen, you'll also have plenty to look at here.  In any case, the art does a good job of making me want to eat the food that these people are eating and feel the way that these people feel when they're eating said food.  The art is over the top and when you can't really have action scenes to making eating seem over the top, the ecchi scenes do a good job of conveying just how good this food is.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, *action* scenes come in overlooking the actual cooking and again, this is like watching iron chef on crack.  It's great.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting sounds fine; there's nothing inherently bad with it.  I can't tell, I can't speak Japanese.  The soundtrack is pretty wonderful though just because it seems to be ripped straight out of the melodramatic soundtrack of Iron Chef America, making it feel like I'm watching a live cooking show, so it at least helps with immersion.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nOkay, if you can't tell with the majority of sports anime (yes, I'm still calling this a sports anime), all characters are pretty one-dimensional with a quirk that makes them likeable.  That's no different here.  As such, you'll probably find minimal character development, which is fine.  I'M NOT EXPECTING CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FROM A SHOW LIKE THIS.  Characters are likeable and that's all that matters.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, shoutouts to Megumi, the cute blue-haired girl that's my main ship for Souma as she gets some pretty refreshing character development throughout the show that climaxes at the end that gets me HYPED for the 2nd season that's scheduled to come out July 2016.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it for what it is.  It's a super fun anime that's funny and gets me hyped about food.  The fanservice is hilarious, but also, it does tone down the nudity about halfway through, showing that it understands that the joke will get old (Self-awareness is good).  Do I recommend it?  Hell yeah.  Is it thought provoking? Hell no.  Go in knowing what to expect and you'll have a blast ^_^\\n\\n\r\n-MSYN",

            "content": "This anime is like the utter definition of \"FoodPorn\". I mean I had no Idea that someone could have orgasm while eating. When I started watching this series I questioned myself why I was watching this dumb series, But as I finished the first episode and got upto the 2nd one I was completely hooked. That serves to show how much of an enjoyment this anime brings about.\r\nI watched a lot of anime since 2014 but since the last two months I just couldn't get into watching anime but this helped me bring back that craze I had for anime. Now without being personal,\r\n(i)I enjoyed this anime precisely because of two factor 1. the Art 2. Story\\n\r\n(ii) The plot might seem cliched  but people do not exactly hate chiches. In fact it takes a great of creativity to work with a stereotypical plot. At first this anime might seem like a story of a prodigy who is the son of another prodigy but you'll realize by the end of it that its not exactly how it seemed at first. \\n\r\n(iv) Without spoiling it for you I will just say this much\\n\r\nIf you like hype, sports, strict school and of course weird bunch of characters, you will enjoy this. \\n\r\n(v) The whole anime is well executed and it has a good flow to the story that'll keep you hooked. \\n\r\nOkay now that I've said all about its good side, time for the bad things; 1. There wasn't much character development in this season. \\n\r\n2. The orgasm factor makes it hard to watch on speaker(sorry, I have a conservative family.)\\n\r\n3. The cliffhanger ending *sigh*\\n\r\nBut still watch it you'll enjoy the series and there's the 2nd season ongoing, so hope it gives a fulfilling ending. \\n\r\nThank you for reading! ^.^",

            "content": "I finally finished watching this, and probably won't be watching another season of the title. I couldn't decide whether to give it 5/10 or 4/10, and decided on 4/10. Detailed breakdown is below.\r\nOverall:\r\nThe anime is very good at wasting viewer's time.\r\nIn its structure it is a very typical shounen anime, except that instead of fighting we have dramatic cooking. I found the anime to be boring and yawn-inducing most of the time, however there were few episodes which sparked my interest a bit. The \"food is so good that it makes people orgasm\" joke gets old 3rd time you see it, which happens quickly. Theanime shares all the problems of a typical shounen anime. Meaning you have characters talking (during a \"fight\") most of the episode while camera slowly pans around. You have gasping/shocked onlookers saying stuff like it \"I can't believe he used ingredient X\"(which is typically followed by 15 minute long explanation of ingridient X), which is followed by a \"counter\" from an opponent, more talking and more explanation.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime isn't ecchi, even though there are \"ecchi\" pictures of people tasting food. The problem is that those pictures aren't funny, aren't sexy, and aren't very interesting. So this joke just gets old fast.\\n\\n\r\nThe story sorta progresses, but it progresses slowly and doesn't exactly reach a conclusion. judging by the pacing I suspect that the creators want to milk the anime for at least 4 more seasons. \\n\\n\r\nI also felt like the whole season could be made 2 times shorter (13 episodes) without losing anything.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe anime uses every trick known to shounen anime in order to cut production costs. There are A LOT of scenes where you'll see something animated in 3 frames being slowly panned with sparkling sfx and LOOONG explanations, usually describing some sort of food. You'll spend a lot of time starting at this or that unanimated food ingredient being displayed on screen. When the series finally animate something properly, it looks good, but it doesn't happen very often. Despite that, I can say that the studio does fairly decent job hiding their \"cost cutting tricks\", but at some point you'll start to wonder why are there so many \"camera panning slowly while somebody talks\" scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI loved designs of some of side characters, especially designs of their faces. Several of side characters (mostly girls) have a great design of faces, and their costumes are well drawn too. While the anime cuts animation costs at every opportunity it gets (with the annoying \"let's pan something slowly while explaining something about current ingredient of the week\"), I haven't noticed any \"cheap\" backgrounds, cheaply drawn characters or anything like that. It is mostly solid, with few side characters looking great (ikumi, erina, and one of the judges whose name I forgot).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIkumi is a highlight of the series, her reactions are somewhat interesting. The rest of the characters are pretty much either faceless or cliched/stereotypical. They follow typical shounen tropes, meaning there will be \"opponents\" acting in absolutely ridiculous fashion in order to display how \"evil\" they are, which is cringeworthy. and makes a lot of interactions cliched or non-believable. The protagonist is forgettable, he is a typical \"shounen with spiky haircut\" with cookie-cutter personality. Only Ikumi and maybe Erina has some semblance of a characters the rest are just walking cliches/shounen tropes.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nThe anime apparently has a good composer, but it feels like that composer is underutilized. in a few places of the anime there were few \"scary\" musical scores, and they were good/interesting. However, most of the time the anime keeps playing the same \"battle\" theme on the loop, and while this theme is okay, it is not great to keep listening to it that often.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement:\\n\r\nMost of the time I was thinking \"why am I watching this?\". 1st episode was okay, few episodes in the middle were okay (there was a moment I thought it would get better), and the last episode was okay too. The rest was incredibly boring, artificially prolonged, very tedious and frankly just plain bad.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line:\\n\r\nI haven't read the manga, but I suspect it might be a better idea to check manga instead. Overall I have impression that anime problems are caused by it being a manga adaptation (and not a very good one). Those slow panning scenes with someone talking might work well in manga (because while you're reading a LOOONG explanation, you might have some cool art to look at), but they don't feel right in anime. There are 2 or 3 visually interesting side characters (as I said, art style is decent and some of the character desiigns are great) but they alone are hardly worth watching 24 episodes of this.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the best suggestion would be to skip, unless you really want to see those 3 girl characters with nice designs, or unless you really enjoy shounen shows.",

This. This is what happens!\r\n[Story] 8/10 - This would have been a perfect ten if it follow one straight storyline, but the show seems to have what I like to call the pokemon effect. Each episode has it's own story and they all link together to create a story. While this is a form of creating a show it is not the best fortelling an overall story. A perfect score would barely be suitable if the story was better but it wasn't.\\n\\n\r\n[Art] 10/10 - Good lord, GOOD LORD. I love the art style, it compliments the show so well. Making one object look intense has never been done so well before! I love it to bits! Action packed scenes filled with color, style and personification! The animation is wonderful and pleasing to look as you are in awe from the intensity the show creates!\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 9/10 - There is not much to say other than the sound is good, there is one scene and once scene only where they played music that did not match the tone at all. That's it!\\n\\n\r\n[Character] 5/10 - Now onto my only real problem with this show. The character development, now this show has a lot of characters and it's hard to balance them all. So over 80% of the characters that are in all the scenes are cast aside as supporting roles. The only character who has a full arc in this season is Megumi, her story was amazing and I loved it. While the other characters stories seemed to be lacking.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 10/10 - This is a party show. Get a bunch of friends like I did and have a flipping blast! It's funny, original and keeps your attention going. The intensity can give you chills down your spine as someone flips a piece of meat in a pan. I have never had so much fun watching something in my life.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall] 9/10 - If only the characters development was better! Even though this isn't a perfect score, it is the only show that came close and has quickly become my second favorite anime. Watch this! Please watch it! It is so freaking fun!",

I may not have all the information necessary to craft a thorough review because I couldn't go beyond the sixth episode. At first glance, I really enjoyed the main protagonist, his personality as a whole, the dramatic set around the theme of cooking which was enjoyable at first but then just got repetitive. When I found myself watching just for the sake of watching in order to know what would happen, I decide that it wasn't entertaining anymore, so I just dropped. So far it feel too predictablethat I dare to say that I know how this story will go to the very end, cause everything so far was too cliche in terms of anime. We got the positive, never give up, I'm gonna make it to the top protagonist that impresses everyone around him despite his history, the know-it-all, I'm the best, I'm a goddess, everyone bow to me female....Erm, antagonist I'd say, who I also dare to say is gonna eventually fall in love with the protagonist, because of plot, and while at first the huge number of characters didn't bother me at first, added to the rest of the things I said didn't help me push through.

It's outrageously funny and well illustrated how they depict every cooking session as some kind of battlefield or orgy of multiple \"foodgasms\" (as the fans of the series call those scenes) where the tasters getsassaulted by peanut butter coated tentacles after tasting one of Soma's creations.\\n\r\nThe comedy and shounen \"battle\" aspects of this show are brilliantly done, it was a great blend of over the top cooking and tense moments. It felt like there wasn't a single filler episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe school where he joins is full of culinary world prodigies who each have some kind of specialty or \"ability\" which they use to make some Gordon Ramsey tier of food. Soma doesn't have that kind of abilities but he learns from his mistakes and has been cooking and working in his family diner since he was a child. It's great to watch Soma improve and improvise each episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in this anime was actually quite good and the quality the put into the \"foodgasm\" and cooking moments was just beautiful. I also adored the lovely chibi moments which made me smile every time.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime wasn't that noticeable but the sounds of cooking were very authentic and enjoyable. Needless to say that it made me hungry. OP and ED were both fine.\\n\\n\r\nThis show kept me hooked (and hungry) episode after episode and in the end I finished this series in four days!\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma is a solid 8/10 a very enjoyable series. \\n\\n\r\nThey also announced season 2 for summer 2016 so stay tuned for more outrageous cooking!",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma is an extremely hyped anime and here, it is very well deserved.  Although it does not really bring anything new to the table, Food Wars is a great shounen with solid presentation and charisma for almost any anime viewer.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story is very simple and straight-forward with Yukihira Soma being forced into a strict cooking academy and having to survive its harsh courses.  The story is hardly original having a transfer student scenario in a different setting.  There are multiple arcs that seem all too familiar, yet I was never disappointed by the story, despite the lack of originality.There are also no moments in which I question why a certain event happens in bewilderment or any point where I am baffled by the characters' actions.  The pacing is great except for the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is very clear and crisp.  The characters look gorgeous and the artstyle is simply great on the eye.  In addition, there is the food.  I have never seen so much hunger emerge from watching an anime than from Shokugeki.  The way in which they layer the sizzling effects among other visuals is breathtaking and can create a very powerful desire for food.  The attention to detail for preparing food is very admirable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10\\n\r\nThe openings are fantastic.  Both the first and second one are above average and create different atmospheres and tones for the story.  The first opening song does a great job at creating hype in the viewer, while forming a general emotion of pure bliss.  The second opening is very good at introducing the vibe in the arc it is present.  The EDs are mixed.  The first one leaves a very satisfying taste to any episode, while the second, I generally skip.  The voice is too grating on the ears for my taste in music.  The insert songs/OST are/is solid at adding to episodes, but they do not completely take over the attention of the viewer.  However, the song with the powerful opera and the song for episode previews were definitely a step above the rest.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7.5/10\\n\r\nThe cast in Shokugeki is very wide.  Almost every single character is very likeable and none do not feel like a complete anime trope.  However, no character feels memorable.  Yukihira is mainly the shounen MC with experience that works hard to achieve his goals.  What might become annoying is the comical repetition of Megumi's (main female lead) backstory.  It has such heavy usage that it makes me facepalm and almost cringe near the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nFor some reason, this anime just feels amazing!  Maybe it's the foodgasms, the art, the articulate preparation of food, but Shokugeki presents itself so well.  Even amid the small errors in characterization and story, Shokugeki is amazing at captivating the audience with its comedy, fanservice, and hype cooking.  The overall package of this anime had me watching it episode after episode because of how well the show seems to appeal to me.  Shokugeki is one of the best shounen animes I have watched and a second season would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10\\n",

He always tries to be relaxed and enjoys himself when cooking possiblytoo much ( :D ), though this know it all got a wake up call as he discoverers cooking and techniques that he never seen before. The characters just sing with harmony along with the deep plot line i can't seem to find anything bad to say about. \\n\\n\r\nIts just such a perfect anime it should be number 1!",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma, Food Wars, Boobs and Foods, call it whatever you will. This anime is CRAZY fun.\r\nYeah, sure, it has it's unusual, lewd moments, but it's quite humorous and entertaining overall; it almost makes your forget that this an anime about food. It's quite hard to put down; you're watching episode after episode, unaware that you're almost done with it.\r\n(This is my first review, btw. Please no hate ;-; )\r\nStory 7/10\r\nIt's a simple story line: some kid goes to school, tries to impress everyone, has to overcome obstacles, meets new people, learns new things, etc. It follows the manga quite poorly, but i personallyhad no problem with them leaving things out. Souma Yukihira is the main character of this anime, who's dream is to make his family restaurant great, and the story is well headed in that direction. Again, a simple story without much complication.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nOh, my goodness, where do I start with the art...? It's amazing! Simply amazing! With every episode you watch, you are guaranteed to have your mouth watery. The food is so well drawn and strangely realistic. I mean, c'mon, what other anime draws food so good that it makes you hungry?? You can't watch an episode without having a full stomach, or else your stomach will growl to death. Trust me.Characters are well-drawn, ambience is nice, overall stunning.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nI personally don't pay too much attention to sound, but the actors put a lot emotion and effort into voicing their characters. Upon tasting food, actors put in emotion and surprise as if the food was really THAT good. Sure, the moans and ecchi sounds can be a bit obnoxious, but overall, it can't be argued with. The \"OOOOHHH\"s from the crowds and the \"EHH?!\" from the judges are a bit overdone but I guess it's there for the emphasis.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10 \\n\r\nEach character has their own personality and there's not two characters alike. This anime takes time to display character development (besides Souma's) and it makes viewers bond with characters like Megumi or the Aldini brothers. I mostly enjoyed seeing how characters interact with Souma. Some hate him, some grow to like him, and others love him. Despite having such a big amount of characters, Shokugeki no Souma does an awesome job at keeping each character interesting and unique. HOWEVER, some characters don't have a big enough spotlight, and that's unfortunate. Characters like Erina, Mito or Akira could have gotten more screen time since they personally seemed intriguing to me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma is the perfect example of quality entertainment for me. It gives me laughs, feels, hunger and joy upon watching. As a food lover, it made me reflect on how beautiful culinary art truly is. I didn't mind the ecchi, the highly predictable scenes nor the chaotic, almost-confusing scenes. This anime just provides so much fun and humor in just 24 episodes. It's sad to think that I have to wait 9+ months for the next season to air.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI like food. I like boobs. I like art. Having all this joined together into an anime was awesome. Again, hyped for season 2 for more intense Shokugekis and more action throughout every episode. Shokugeki no Souma is so good that it made me read ahead in the manga (which i didn't want to do, but i couldn't help it.) and a lot more action is coming our way with season 2 airing soon. \\n\\n\r\nTl;dr\\n\r\nStory: 7/10. Simple. School-life type of anime with a cocky MC with a big dream.\\n\r\nArt: 10/10. Awesome. Realistic food, well-drawn characters, tons of detail.\\n\r\nSound: 8/10. Meh. Not the best, but definitely not bad.\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10. Lots of variety and different personalities despite the big cast.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. My favorite anime so far. So much fun to watch.\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. Can't wait for the next season. \\n",

            "content": "This show is pretty fantastic to look at. The art in this is spot on and anyone can see that this show wouldn\u2019t have been the same in a different art style. While there are times when in fluctuates from time to time into a more basic, chibi with white eyes style, but this happens so little that it hardly impacts the show in any significant way. One of the most amazing things that this show seems to do is make the food look so good! With each dish presentation and judging, the food looks so well drawn, that its hard to think anything lessthan the same amount of time was put into drawing it. The use of steam and other things make each dish stand out as unique. Near the end of the 24 episodes, the use of Fragrance is a main theme and being able to see each smell drifting through the air shows exactly what the characters end up talking about, it really puts you right in the action. And while not a massive part of the show, there is quite a bit of fan service, both male and female, so be aware of that.\\n\\n\r\nWhile enjoyable to listen to, the music feels very repetitive at times. When big moments happen, or something important is going on, it was often the same song in the background every time, and while this was really nice in the beginning, I\u2019d hoped for the same variety that the food had to be in the background music. the first opening and closings were pretty catchy but I didn\u2019t have much of a problem skipping through them, they aren\u2019t something that I would write home about. Then at episode 14, they both change to something a little rougher, and while the opening still wasn\u2019t amazing, i found the ending to often get stuck in my head and I would continue to hum after the song had ended.\\n\\n\r\nThe story here revolves around a first year high school student that just wants to surpass his father in cooking, but after challenging him since 6th grade, he has lost 489 times, and won zero times. but after a run in with a group that wants to shut down his family\u2019s diner, Yukihira will fight to make food that is so good, the people will run off with their tail between their legs. However, after this happens, His father shuts down the diner and he is sent off to the most prestigious culinary school in Japan, Totsuki, which has a graduation rate of 10%. Yukihira works to impress all of the culinary masterminds of his amazing skills to prove that he isn\u2019t just some diner cook, but the best chef there. This is a fantastic story, and while predictable at times, it was really enjoyable to cheer Yukihira on throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nMy overall impressions of this show were overwhelmingly positive. The art is gorgeous, the music got you in the mood, and at the end of the day I just want to cook! Why I would even say that I would buy a cookbook based on this show, it is that entertaining, and to try cooking these meals would be a whole new level of entertainment for me, who already enjoys cooking. While I say all of these amazing things the show does have flaws. The music is repetitive and often forgettable, and while the Characters are each unique and stand on their own, sometimes they are unnecessary. For example, in the last 5 or 6 episodes, characters that were just being introduced, and all of a sudden had a key role to play. While the last 3 episodes focused solely on judging, the main character has been subbed for people that we hardly know as if the show is all about them. I felt those last three episodes could have been cut down to a single with only judging of the people we truly know and care about. While the show does end on a cliff-hanger, I am excited to know that there will be a second season airing in July of 2016. I\u2019m looking forward to that because there are MANY unanswered questions. \\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.5/10\\n",

            "content": "Video Version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqia4M3gnT0\r\nWhen I first heard about Food Wars: Shokugeki no Soma, I thought \u201cso now we have Rail Wars, Summer Wars and now Food Wars\u201d. Food Wars sound more like a  anime version of masterchef than a anime which will actually any sort of \u201cwar\u201d. Annd I was right. Food Wars! is a deep and mature show about the production of food and the hardships that come with it and truly shows what our character are going through.. Oh wait that Silver Spoon not Food Wars l... Food Wars is Food ****\r\nFood Wars is one of those animes which sounds ridiculous on paper,like Steins;Gate, people attach a phone on a microwave and time travel? But unlike Stiens;Gate this one is ridiculous and the anime knows  this.  This anime is essentially the polar opposite to making food in real life because making food in real life. The show is very over the top. There is this thing in anime where they make the most mundane task look amazing, both Death Note and Kaiji use this. But Food Wars! uses this technique of create the illusion that making food is much cooler than it really is. It really doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously but this isn\u2019t a flaw, it\u2019s self aware.  The Story of Food Wars! takes place when our protagonist\u2019s  father closes his diner to go around the world and sends his son to an elite culinary school where only 10% of the student actually graduate.  Food Wars! feels like an action anime without any of the action. Literally this anime has everything to be a shounen battle series, ninjas, samurais, witches [Episode 21], the old evil mastermind, and the guy with pink hair and even Indiana Jones? [Episode 22] Oh wait, thats not anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Food Wars I must say are very generic, but done right. Unlike Seraph, where the trope defined the character, in Food Wars, the characters had more to them. \\n\r\nOur protagonist Yukihira Soma is the typical shounen character, overpowered, over confident. He is the type of character that never loses. He so arrogant that typically you would hate him but for some reason you don\u2019t. He, like almost all of the cast,doesn\u2019t show don\u2019t have any character development.  He is a completely flawed character which would break the show but he is surprisingly, he is quite a charismatic character who is enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nMegumi Tadokoro, she is our shy and timid character of this series. She gets a lot development than Yukihira but her main role in any given episode seems to be there to show how great Yukihira is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, Nakiri Erina. She is the typical \u201cI don\u2019t want to admit that you are any good\u201d character and I really don\u2019t really see why so many people like her so much. She is so bland and boring but not only that she seems like a completely horrible person with the \u201cI am so much better than you\u201d type of attitude. \\n\r\nThough lovable at most times, our characters aren\u2019t the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Food Wars! was done by JC Staff and was mostly really good with bright and vibrant colors being shown to us every second.  The mangas really exaggerated nature  was translated  really well, when there is a nice fragrance there are these colors all over the screen. The artstyle of Food Wars! is very over the top and colorful and it definitely a pleasure to watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nFood Wars came out this Spring and finished at the end of summer.\\n\r\nThe first season come out this Spring, and hopefully will get another season.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show that is categorized as a comedy, I didn\u2019t really laugh much. Whenever they try to make the show emotional or something it's not, it completely and utterly fails because I really don\u2019t care.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was my favourite out of all that came out this summer. It is so enjoyable, and has a similar feel to some of those older shows like Kenichi.\\n\r\nFood Wars was one of the most enjoyable shows I\u2019ve seen in a long time and you should definitely check it out, it's a ton of fun but does have some apparent flaws so i give this anime a 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "Well, what can I say. This anime leaves little left to be desired.  It gracefully combines all of the parts of anime that we all have grown to love and blends it together like the many savory dishes that the show unfolds. \r\nThe story is so unique that I am sure it will continue to alter the flow of modern anime. It takes a super integral part of our everyday, mundane lives and expands upon it in the most glorious way imaginable. This is the story about cooking and yet it somehow is able to masterfully make you feel sadness, happiness, hate, and joyall in one show. Not only is the story unique but it is also incomprehensibly enjoyable and leaves you yearning for more.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is another dish entirely. I would say out of the many anime I have seen this anime takes a large piece of the cake. Most people when they say it has great art they mean it is different in a way that makes them feel refreshed. This anime takes what we are all used to and simply astounds you with it. The shear quality of the cooking scenes along with expressions, beautiful scenes and waves of colorful food is something that I simply can't ignore and talk about. \\n\\n\r\nMusic, in my experience, is what really MAKES an anime. It can make the most silly depiction turn your brain into a funeral and turn a foul mood into a festival. This anime uses music so well that is strums on your heartstrings. Like the food that they introduce, the music does an exceptional job at making each triumph and defeat seem insanely intense like they ought to be.   However this is not the only thing that the music does in this anime. What really is beautiful about it is the shear use they have for the music. I am listening to the soundtrack as I write this review and it has so much strength and radiance that I want to just listen to it all night. I would recommend this anime even if the only good thing about it was the music (which is NOT the case). \\n\\n\r\nThe characters as splendid. Like many great anime, this series takes many characters you have all seen before and makes them more fierce. The usual cry-baby main guy character we have probably all seen is now a confident, eccentric young man who's motives make you want to cheer for him the entire length of the way. In sync with the art, the characters are mostly all lovable and gives off a sense of heart-warming intensity when you meet them.\\n\\n\r\nAs overall enjoyment I would probably give this a 9.5 but they have no such score and since I only want to save 10 for either the second season of this show (if it happens) or a truly insane masterpiece, I will leave it at a solid 9.  \\n\r\nI had a simply memorable time watching this anime. I will most likely re-watch it again and again. I highly recommend it (although beware of a few small ecchi scenes, which are actually done fairly well).",

I will also do \"top 5 character reviews\" on future reviews.\r\n1. Souma Yukihira:\r\nSouma is your typical Shonen protagonist with a special ability. However, this special ability is cooking. Yukihira is extremely confident with his skill, and will never back downfrom any challenge. Also, he isn't a dense protagonist. \\n\r\n2. Alice Nakiri:\\n\r\nHow can one girl be so perfect? She makes the series entertaining from her cartoonish appearance when teasing others to her unique cooking skills. She's objectively the best girl of the series. Too bad she's only a supporting character. \\n\r\n3. Ryou Kurokiba: \\n\r\nHe might look a generic emo guy, but once he puts that headband on he shows his true self. He's one of the most interesting characters in the series. Also, some of the funniest scenes in the series occur when Ryou and Alice are together. \\n\r\n4. Megumi Tadokoro: \\n\r\nEvery series needs a moeblob; Food Wars is no exception. Like Alice, Megumi makes one of the best comical facial expressions in the series. She might be shy and clumsy, but her spirit never dies. Even in tough situations, she never loses hope and will do anything to impress her friends and family back home. Megumi is truly an inspirational character.\\n\r\n5. Akira Hayama:\\n\r\nAkira is one of the strongest characters in the anime when it comes to cooking. He's the Archer of Cooking and a formidable rival for Souma. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for the flaws to make this review less biased. Also, since every series has its pros and cons.\\n\r\nOne of the major flaws was that the series was predictable. The opening pretty much spoils on what's going to occur in the next episode. Also, I felt like the series needed a better villain. Erina is supposedly one of the main antagonists of the series, but she shows her soft side in the series. Erina doesn't make a bad villain, but I feel like that she could have been better. \\n\r\nThere was also two minor villains, but they were pretty weak.\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Food Wars\" is a very enjoyable and hilarious series, built on a somewhat standard idea of battles. The food is well-described and thought-out, and actually makes you hungry.\r\nI felt that the characters, while fun to watch, seemed lacking in impact (aside from Souma, who I might argue isn't as OP as people make him out to be). The development of Megumi was very slow, and then made somewhat of a jump. While that lasted to the finale, it felt a tad rushed. Other supporting characters are fun to look at, but eventually forgettable. The only characters I can really remember details of are Souma, Megumi,and Erina. While the supporting characters are there to help things along (in each one's own way), they did feel throw-away by the end of the season. If there is a Season 2, I hope the focus is better distributed.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, as I said before, things are generally standard. The use of \"food gasms\" demonstrates the appeal of the dishes served, and always manages to make me hungry. Despite the fan-service being over-the-top, at least it was mixed-gender. The entire season somewhat felt like an appetizer, and I hope the next one (be it existing or not) will fill my stomach more.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is top-notch, giving everything (and everyone) vibrant and distinct identifiers. It's clear, direct, and beautiful. Since the show is comedic in nature, there are nice changes in the animation to lighten the tone of the show, and keep things lighthearted (and not just battle-oriented). Character designs are nice. The music for the series is VERY clever. It blends distinct sounds from different cultures depending on the theme of the dish that is currently being shown. It helps with the immersion of the viewer, bringing forth epic tracks when called for, and a lighter tone otherwise. ED 1 and OP 2 are definitely favorites. I have no real complaints about the voice acting; each character is portrayed true to their traits.\\n\\n\r\nEvery week, I loved sitting down and watching this show. It would leave me hanging, wanting the next episode to come out already. The comedy balanced the drama, the characterization was well done, the atmosphere was cute, and in the end, it just made me HUNGRY. On that note, if you watch this show while rather hungry... good luck.\\n\\n\r\n\"Food Wars\" is a highly-enjoyable and delicious (hah) experience. Despite some lacking character development, it leaves you wanting more.",

            "content": "Who thought that watching people cook could be this much fun.\r\nFifteen year old Yukihira Souma has spent most of his life helping his father in their family restaurant. Through this he has acquired many culinary skills and has become a very competent chef, but he is still unable to outmatch his father, and prove he is a worthy successor. When one day his father gets a job that requires him to travel around the world, so he enrols his son into the prestigious Tootsuki Culinary Academy. When he comes to the academy to take the transfer exam he is to cook for Erina Nakiri theacademy\u2019s best student, who is mightily impressed by Souma\u2019s dish, but for some unknown reason does not want to show that she liked it, and tries to fail him, but Souma still manages to be accepted. Here at Tootsuki Academy he faces many a challenge that put all of his prior training to the test, but he takes them all head on, and  manages to make tons of good friends in the prosess.\\n\\n\r\nThe story while decent is nothing out of the ordinary and has to be the weakest aspect of the anime. At first the storytelling is great but slowly as the story progresses the pacing begins to suffer and the story starts to occasionally drag a bit. This is most prominent during the cooking duels as they last for several episodes and feature annoying cliffhangers. Even though I have had my complaints, they are all minor and are typical for the shounen genre as a whole. The ending was satisfactory, but only in the case we are to get a second season, which is likely as the anime has gotten some great ratings \\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s main highlight are its characters. There hasn't been many shows with so many interesting and fun characters, and surprisingly I have to say that I liked them all. Our main character Yukihira Souma has to be one of the best leads I have seen in a while, he is just a whole lot of fun. The way he interacts with the other characters with his extreme confidence and easygoing demeanour is just perfect. Sadly we lack a lot of insight into his past and he experiences little to no growth through the course of this season, but the others sure make up for this and.\\n\r\nThe main female character is Tadokoro Megumi and she is just as great as Soumaif not better. At first she is this extremely shy and nervous girl who wants to avoid getting into trouble and thus wants to stay away from Souma, but gets stuck with him in class, and later finds out they also reside in the same dorm. They form this great duo as they are almost polar opposites at first, but later Souma becomes a major influence on her, and slowly she starts gaining confidence and evolves into a fabulous chef. Her development is fantastic and the way she slowly grows as a person is great, and we are able to clearly see the influences other people make on her.\\n\r\nOne of the more important characters is Erina Nakiri, academy\u2019s best student and Souma\u2019s main rival. The two of them met right in the beginning as she was the one overseeing the entrance exam. We can see almost at once that se is attracted to Souma, but she is repressing her feelings and so we can see some interesting moments between the two, Souma being outgoing as always, trying to communicate with her, while she is struggling not to open up to him.\\n\r\nNext we have a whole host of secondary characters which are all amazingly well done, and even though there are so many of them each and every one of them feels distinct, if not unique. I especially liked the other residents of North Star Dormitory, the way they all interact with each other is just prefect and the one who stands tall above all others is Isshiki Sempai, the only upperclassman in the dorm, who is an exhibitionist. The other highlight of the anime is Souma\u2019s self-proclaimed rival Takumi Aldini, the only other student in the academy with prior experience with working in a restaurant, who always wants to compete with Souma, but Souma never takes him seriously.\\n\\n\r\nNext up we have the audio-visual side of things and first off I want to say it is amazing, especially the art. The art is just so well done that I have to congratulate J.C.Staff for this amazing display, but one has to wonder what they were doing with Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai that they aired at the same time as this, as the gap in quality is so great. The thing some people have complained over is the abundance of fan-service and while it can be a bit annoying at times, I found it to be used perfectly as they managed to convey the feelings of the characters while they were eating some seriously yummy looking food. I have to say this is not an anime one should watch while hungry, as the food on screen looks just too delicious, so I frequently got hungry while watching. There  is one more point that I have to praise, and that would be the character expressions as they managed to look just perfect. \\n\r\nThe soundtrack was, while not amazing, perfectly adequate for this kind of anime. The openings and endings were all well done but with the exception of the first opening, which was nothing short of amazing, they were nothing too special. \\n\\n\r\nWhat more can I say, Shokugeki no Souma has to be one of the highlights of this year\u2019s anime and deserves a high score of a nine out of ten. Do I recommend this anime? Well yes of course I do, everyone searching for a nice comedy should seriously consider seeing this. The only reason why I would sometimes withhold my recommendation would be in connection with the fan-service as I it might be to much for some people. Actually the only thing that kept this anime from getting a perfect rating was the lack of a sensible ending, however that can be alleviated by a second season, and when that comes out I will gladly change my score into a ten.\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review, please leave some feedback as I am trying to improve my writing and then you are going to be able to get more of my quality reviews.",

The story is unique to me since I've never really watched any animes about food before. The only thing that's a little weird is the foodgasms. If they would have toned it down a little bit on that it probably could have gotten a 10/10 for me. Souma is great character and I really want to see how the second season goes (hoping they have one like i said). The sound and animation were very good.I mean the food actually looks real. If you're into food anime, I really recommend this show. ALL the characters are likable and theres only a few I find slightly annoying. While watching this show, you really want the main character to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nIt only took me four days to finish (while watching other shows) so I hope you enjoy it too!",

            "content": "This isn't your average anime. Honestly how often do we see an animated show centered around cooking with ecchi sprinkled in? At first I wasn't sure how it could pull the audience in week after week. \r\nEpisodes consist mostly of characters cooking plus tasters' reactions to their food. It sounds simple but there are underlying themes that accompany each cooking event that always manage to mix things up. One battle might be about building up confidence while another might be about learning from past mistakes. And of course there will be \"conflict\" infused into each cookoff. Whether it's spectators wondering how a character will makea certain technique work, lacking an ingredient, or coping with pressure, the problems these protagonists face are interesting and it's always satisfying to see them pull through. All the while, the kitchen drama is really emphasized but not so much that it's laughable.\\n\\n\r\nI will say that the first arc is where the series shines brightest because of the very natural character progression and much more varied plot. The second arc tried to flesh out side characters but the way it was attempted felt far too forced and almost comes out of nowhere. In my opinion it's a terrible idea to suddenly bring up someone who hardly ever gets screen time, put in some flashbacks and a few observations from other characters, and call that fleshing out that person. Another thing I especially didn't like about the second arc is how the last part became all about judging dishes. I understand that it's a necessary evil, given the circumstances. But it strays away from the typical format by completely removing the well-handled cooking sequences.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I appreciated a lot about the show is how it will subvert expectations every now and then. Given that a lot of characters sort of fall into their own comedic roles (a la Fairy Tail), you would this simplicity would carry over to plot points and event outcomes. The fact that it doesn't is a welcome surprise. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is very appropriately colorful, with dishes almost guaranteeing salivation. The attention to food science is admirable, and the soundtracks used are so memorable you'll probably look them up on YouTube. With the amazing looking dishes these characters put out, the likable characters, and controlled humorous style, I have to definitely recommend Shokugeki no Souma.",

            "content": "Well the second season of Shokugeki no Soma is airing, so I thought it would be appropriate to write a spoiler-free review for those who are thinking about getting into this anime.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\n- The story here is nothing new, you have the MC that tries to become the best in his profession (which in this scenario is cooking), and on the way he motivates people. Soma, the main character, goes to a culinary school for prestige teen chefs, but since his family doesn\u00b4t run a international restaurant chain, nor a restaurant that is famous,so the other pupil think of him as poor. He tries toprove them wrong. Sometimes the story falls too much on the culinary side, and since I\u00b4m not a chef I got lost a few times. It is a story that lacks any deeper meaning, but is sufficient.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 8/10\\n\r\n-What can I say about the art and animation of this show that I couldn't\u00b4t say about most newer anime. I never was one to care about the visuals, but I do care about the animations, and in this show they are quite good. Since it\u00b4s a culinary show the animation must be fast, detailed and smooth to capture the details of the cooking. And it does it well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\n-I didn\u00b4t really feel the opening on this show to be amazing, so most of the time I skipped it. The music during the show provided some help during boring moments, but it was never astounding. I haven\u00b4t really noticed the OST that much while watching. It felt some touches during the cook-offs that really helped build the hype. Otherwise it was good, but nothing game-changing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\n-Why should I watch a culinary show? I asked myself the same question before getting in this show, and I think I personally found the answer in the characters. Sometimes I won\u00b4t watch a anime series because I don\u00b4t like the MC, but in this show I think he was amazing. Having that Naruto \u00b4Believe it\u00b4 feel to him, but much cooler. I don\u00b4t think this show had a arch-nemesis, mostly when a character seemed evil they eventually turn good after about 1 episode. A lot of supporting characters with their own sets of culinary skills, backstories, and characters tied to them had me sitting all day watching this show. Although I feel some characters should have more screen time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\n- I was surprised when a culinary show could keep my attention for 24 episodes. The clever writing and attention to detail makes you want to repeat a scene just to grasp the full story. The tastings of the foods were spiced up by some ecchi scenes, which were sometimes unnecessary. And while the first half had nearly no boring parts, the second half, especially towards the end, I felt that they speaking too much about food for my enjoyment (I mean I don\u00b4t really need to know the history of some French food, do I). \\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 8/10\\n\r\n- I would recommend this to anybody that likes shows with great characters and some humor. I wouldn\u00b4t call it a masterpiece because it has a few problems, but neither would I call it a bad show. Why? It simple was too much fun for that, I have watched the entire season 1 in one day. If you don\u00b4t want some deep story, and you just want to have some goofs and gafs this show is for you. \\n\\n",

            "content": "STORY - 9\r\nART - 10\r\nSOUND - 10\r\nCHARACTER - 10\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\r\nShokugeki no Souma is one of the most salivating anime I have ever watched. It took in all the goodness that I craved in the medium and used all that to satisfy my hunger for entertainment in a fulfilling manner.\r\nKneading the story into one condensed dough, it's essentially a culinary school of exhilarating cooking face-offs as ambitious students faced the harsh challenges ahead of them. It's an entertaining anime but it also taught me many cooking skills I didn't know before. Showcasing the different type of foods and explaining how the ingredients were compatible witheach other to produce a final dish was very interesting. And as great as the foods were, I have to talk about the factor the drove the anime to its full potential, the cast of characters. The diversity like the confident and amusing personality in many of them contrasted to the more self-deprecating ones. They just met but quickly became supportive (and rivals) of each other which goes to show their developing bonds. Not everyone did have an origin backstory as the show focused on a selected few, but those ones who did added more depth to their own character on why they went to such a prodigious school and the experiences they went through beforehand that helped harness their skills. Another nice thing albeit more preferential were the humors which were quite stupid in a good way. Being transported to imaginative, silly worlds full of food fanservice after tasting won't bode well with everyone out there. For me though, while it can be repetitively tiring, it did managed to shroud me with joyous giggles a lot of times.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the audiovisuals and the high quality still lingered in the air. Using vividly colorful art style stimulated positive moods within me such as cheerfulness and ecstacity. The fluid animation also helped with that as it didn't break any of those emotions with lags. As it's an anime that has food as its foundation, you need to get something out of it when you're showing them. And J.C.Staff did just that with the amazing mouth-watering details in the foods, gurgling my stomach with the crispiness or juiciness and the steam coming out of kitchenwares. More on the humor side, ecchi shots of sexual poses can get pretty over-the-top frequently which can be cringy at times but I enjoyed most of it. Chibi comedy however, really nailed the silliness of this show. Now, something that also added more would be the sizzling or basically the cooking sound effects, slowly aiding my hunger as the food gets cooked. I also loved the accents that the voice-actors imitated from different nationalities. Many fun and sadder soundtracks harmonized each scene well but the ones that caught my attention were the cultural OSTs of some particular country. They functioned as an immersion in the variations of gourmets out there. It's like actually eating in the country itself and I'm thankful to get to experience that in front of a screen.\\n\\n\r\nKicking back while relaxing to take in all the flooded euphoria at every episode was a blessing to me. The light-hearted interactions between the characters and the cooking aspect were a spectacle to watch. From the first episode, the way it was set up made me knew that Shokugeki no Souma will take the icing on the cake in my personal anime experience and I'm happy it didn't disappoint me all the way through to the final episode.",

The overall story is enjoyable with our main character aiming for the top seat of his academy and also mastering his cooking. Mysterious characters such as his father and the alumni make it even more interesting to watch. They make you question:\"What's next?\". I like how they present cooking and how they make the atmosphere so combat-like. The openings are just like openings from every typical action shounen. Overall, it's an anime that I wouldrecommend someone to watch but not because of the story. The characters and the plot (cooking) make it enjoyable on their own.",

            "content": "2:45 min into episode one:  the first instance of tentacle sex.\r\nAnd this isn't hentai.  This is a cooking anime.  I laughed out loud, but not in a good way.  This wasn't what I was watching Shokugeki no Souma for.  I was watching it because it is highly rated, and because it has a couple of my favorite seiyuu.  The first episode was mostly cringe-worthy, and I nearly dropped it.  But I tend to give anime more than one episode if it is highly rated, and I managed to get through the whole thing.  So, does it deservethis high rating?\\n\\n\r\nNot in my opinion.  It is undoubtedly due to the high incidence of ecchi, so if ecchi is your thing, you can take the rating as guidance; you will get your fill here.  If ecchi is not your thing, this show can still be enjoyable, but you have to make allowance for the surfeit of ecchi in form of foodgasms any time anyone eats anything, which gets repetitive and annoying. The show tries half-heartedly to provide a little male nudity as well, but that's nothing compared to the amount of boobage present.  I personally am not a fan of huge boobs, and here nearly all women have oversized udders, and it's a little gross how much they push themselves into the forefront of most scenes, not just the dedicated ecchi ones.\\n\\n\r\nStory (4/10): Quite simple -- Yukihira Souma has helped his father in the diner since he was small, and has become quite the competent cook.  One day his father packs up his duffle bag and heads out into the world without so much as a preparatory warning, and sends Souma off to Tootsuki Academy, an elite finishing school for chefs where only the top 10% graduate.  Souma, coming from a humble diner doesn't quite fit with the elite student body, but that doesn't faze him, because he is very confident in his skills.  These skills will be tested a lot, since the school specializes in \"shokugeki\" -- cooking battles with the competitors staking something of value on the outcome.\\n\\n\r\nThis is basically a standard shounen battle anime, except the battles are fought over food, and knives are used to attack ingredients, not opponents.  Extra tension is added via especially high stakes -- many battles are used to weed out students, who're kicked out of school.  Goodbye, you are the weakest link.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone looking for romance here, there is none.  Oh, there are harem possibilities, and no doubt many will ship various girls with Souma, and even some guys, but there is no hint of him actually being interested romantically in anyone; he is aromantic and asexual; his mind is on cooking and cooking alone.  It's actually kind of refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):  Lovely, lovely food.  Characters are easy to tell apart (at least those who matter; the others are undistinguished, and you can pretty much tell who to pay attention to by that alone).  Animation is alright, nothing outstanding, but it doesn't really need to be any better because the art is so good that you don't really notice how often it doesn't move.  The 3DCG doesn't blend very well, but it's not really horrible either.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/19): I liked the first OP and Ed, not so much the second.  BGM is well done.  Voice talent is appropriate, occasionally over the top as is typical for shounen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5/10):  This is where the show fails the most.  Souma is quite a pleasant protagonist for a shounen show; he's merely justifiedly confident instead of a conceited brat, he does not take offense even at outright provocation (this is played very well for humour because he defuses most situations that would normally end in a fight).  He's even nice to some of his competitors.  I like him a lot better than the usual shounen protag, whom I tend to find annoying.  But Souma has minimal character development.  He is this way from the very start, and while he grows as a chef, his character seems set.  He's probably a bit too perfect, he doesn't have to really struggle either, not in comparison to some of his fellow students.\\n\\n\r\nThe character that undergoes the most growth is Tadokoro Megumi who comes from humble beginnings and is even more of a fish out of water at prestigious Tootsuki than Souma because she completely lacks any confidence at the start.  She makes the most progress during the show.\\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters, while clearly outlined, are not particularly interesting, and experience limited growth; usually by confrontation with Souma whom they want to beat (and for the girls, whom they are attracted to), and who learn one or another lesson by losing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):  The show grew on me.  I mostly enjoyed the food, and the explanations about it -- you won't learn cooking from this show, but your love of food might increase, and you will definitely learn some things about food preparation you didn't know before.  It helped that I liked Souma.  I could have done without the ecchi which detracted from the show for me, but I enjoyed the food enough to watch the second season.  Oh yeah, point deduction for ending in the middle of an arc; I feel for the people who actually watched this as broadcasted. Since I am binging after the 2nd season finished airing, I can go straight into that.\\n\\n\r\nTotal (29\u00f75): 6",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma was one of the most hyped anime of the year, and why wouldn\u2019t it be, it is an adaptation of one of Weekly Shounen Jump\u2019s most popular manga in Japan. And luckily Shokugeki no Souma succeed to surpass all hype and in some aspect, it might even be better than the manga. Now Shokugeki no Souma can be summarized in one line. It\u2019s cooking competitions, with more action/suspense than the average shounen and, umm\u2026 food porn. You don\u2019t need to like cooking to enjoy this anime, neither will the fanservice turn off ecchi hater. It\u2019s got fanservice for both genders, and itsshounen characteristics makes sure the cooking doesn\u2019t get boring.\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe premise is quite simple, Yukihira Soma is a teenager who worked with his dad for many years taking care of their restaurant. One day, his father leaves for overseas and makes Souma apply to Totsuki Culinary Academy, where only 10% of the students graduate yet Soma aims to be the top of the school. And that\u2019s pretty much it. Add some shounen characteristics and foodgasms here and there and you got yourself a pretty anime. Throughout the anime, Souma makes friends and enemies and learns much more about the world of cooking and realizes if he were to stay at his restaurant, he wouldn\u2019t be able to learn all these new things. The main plot is really simple, but it\u2019s the story arcs in between that are really entertaining, such as the Training Camp arc and Autumn Election Arc. However there are filler moments in the anime where it seems like those episodes where there for no major reason, such as the Karaage Wars arc. However, the story, for Shokugeki no Souma, for most of the time, works. The anime succeeds in building up suspense, and delivery. However the anime is sometimes predictable, but it\u2019s alright because it\u2019s still entertaining.\\n\r\nStory: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma is more of a comedy shounen anime than anything. Sure it\u2019s got ecchi moments too, but they\u2019re not there for a considerable amount of the anime. However, it\u2019s got more shounen qualities than other shounen anime. When food competition takes place, the cooking is so over-the-top, the suspense is so thrilling, and the characters are energetic, it\u2019s hard to say that it\u2019s not action-packed. Normally I don\u2019t say this, but the uneven pacing of Shokugeki no Souma helps make the anime better. The anime will have a fast pace for its normal scenes, but during the moments when a dish is being judged, the pacing is brought down considerably low. An entire episode can literally end up judging only two dishes. But because of that, more suspense is actually being built (also, more foodgasms). And due to long judging moments, you actually get to learn quite some things about cooking and food. Its shounen style definitely adds more enjoyment to this anime. Its combination of shounen-style cooking, foodgasms fanservice make the show have an interesting variety of genres. The only issue is that it does end in the middle of the arc, and it would have been better it was a 3-cour anime to finish its arc, but don\u2019t worry, a second season is a must after it\u2019s high reception and popularity (and it\u2019s from a Jump manga).\\n\r\nPresentation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma has a fairly huge cast, and most of the characters end up being memorable, interesting and hilarious. Yukihira Souma is your typical shounen main character. His skills are over-powering and he consistently get challenged by other students, only to make Souma look better\u2026 most of the time. This anime doesn\u2019t take much time to show that Souma\u2019s not the king of cooking as there are many to whom he has lost too. However, Souma is a treat to watch to; he\u2019s cocky, but also charismatic. Next you have Tadokoro Megumi who is your typical \u201cI have skills but I\u2019m too nervous to actually show my potential\u201d girl. However she gets great character development throughout the anime. She develops into a more confident character by the second third and she ends up being the most developed character of the anime. Next up we have Nakiri Erina, who is your typical tsundere and\u2026 that\u2019s it. Unfortunately she isn\u2019t much in the anime to actually get proper development. However she is entertaining enough to not be annoying. The supporting cast is filled with colorful characters that together make an entertaining cast. You have that \u201cweird-but-wise senpai\u201d Isshiki Satoshi, the wannabe cool rival Aldini Takumi and his brother Isami, the bossy rival that pouts at everything Nakiri Alice (who ends up being the most likable supporting character), and so many others that are all fun to watch, even if they are being used as plot devices to move the story.\\n\r\nCharacter: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma\u2019s art style is quite simplistic and is the one you would typically see in a school comedy. However simplistic is what works best for this anime. Comedy moments would be shown using chibi-looking characters and that helps add to the humor of the show. Chibi faces such as Souma\u2019s over-confident face, Erina\u2019s tsundere face, Megumi frightened face, Alice\u2019s pouting face and much more, creates a lot of funny moments. The art for the food is good enough to make you hungry and mouth-watery. The foodgasms fanservice are also very delicious (pun intended) and are fun to look. Also when judges are judging a dish, the background may change to describe the flavor of a dish and it helps the audience envision the feel of the dish. The character designs are also really nice. All characters look the same as the manga. Although it\u2019s easy to distinguish one from another by just looking at their hair colour. However, all characters are very attractive and nice enough. Add that with the colorful backgrounds and food, and you got yourself an anime that\u2019s easy on the eyes.\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animation is top-notch and consistent. Never once did it seem like they were saving budget and cutting it short. Sure, the animations are mind-blowing, but it works for this anime. During chibi moments, the animation is much more simplistic and \u201cframey\u201d but it works well with the context. However the animations used for when people are cooking are great as they are smooth and have this action feel to it that makes it feel like as if a shounen battle is taking place. The animation quality is pretty much what you would expect from J.C. Staff; nothing mind-blowing, simplistic, yet it works with the context and consistent.\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Shokugeki no Souma is excellent, however most of the seiyuu are pretty unknown. Souma is voiced by Matsuoka Yoshitsugu (Kirito (Sword Art Online), Sora (No Game No Life)), who voices every other OP MC. He is everywhere, but it\u2019s for a reason though. He is a talented voice actor and he knows very well how to place comic dialogues in serious situations without ruining the feel. Megumi is voiced by Takahashi Minami, who hasn\u2019t done much roles in her life, but after this anime, her career might get a boost. She plays the part of an unconfident character well. Erina\u2019s voiced by Taneda Risa (Kaori (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso), Saki (Shinsekai Yori)) who does a decent job. She does the tsundere role right without overacting too much. There are some really popular seiyuu in the supporting cast such as Shinomiya is Nakamura Yuuichi (Tomoya (Clannad), Gray (Fairy Tail)) and Isshiki is Sakurai Takahiro (Suzaku (Code Geass), Makishima (Psycho-Pass)). Overall, the voice acting is top-notch and the seiyuu are talented enough to be both serious and humorous.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music is mostly excellent in Shokugeki no Souma. The anime consists of two openings and two endings. The first opening, \u201cKibou no Uta\u201d, is pretty catchy and represents the show very well. The second opening, \u201cRising Rainbow\u201d, however is much, much better as it pumps your adrenaline and it really sound like something from a hardcore action shounen. The first ending, \u201cSpice\u201d, is one of the best I\u2019ve heard this year, especially the full version of the song. The second ending, \u201cSacchan no Sexy Curry\u201d, however is mediocre at best. The music is catchy, but the voice is kind of irritating. The soundtrack for this anime is much, much better than what I expected. My favorite ones, \u201cFood Battle Start!\u201d and \"The Kitchen's Front Line\" is used very well in the anime to create suspense. \"The Secret Ingredient Named Victory\" is used when Souma proves his badassary and it sounds awesome. The music used when dishes are being judged will make you laugh because opera music with foodgasms = hilariousness. \\n\r\nMusic: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nIt was hard for me to not enjoy this anime. On paper, it would be something that would make me think that this would be one disjointed anime; shounen-style cooking with foodgasms. But in reality this is a creative and well-written anime that knows how to target a wide range of audiences. Its over-the-top cooking can put anyone in a smile and its fanservice is a great example of \u201cecchi done right\u201d. The show is predictable and formulaic, but it still grabs your attention. The characters interacting with each other and their own ego are fun to watch. Very few times do I actually watch an anime while it\u2019s running, but for Shokugeki no Souma, I couldn\u2019t just wait after watching the first couple of episodes. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Shokugeki no Souma is a must watch for those who have interest in anime. It is definitely a contender for the best anime of the year, and its style and presentation really makes this one enjoyable anime. It does complete justice to the manga, only cutting out scenes that have no purpose in the story (Ping pong scene (hopefully it\u2019s an OVA)), and manages to have a pacing that is favorable for the story (a slower pace during tournaments create more suspense). Shokugeki no Souma is a fresh breath of air and it tells us that anime still can have creative writing and can properly adapt a manga series without putting fillers or without rushing. And as for this review I\u2019m \u201cHappy to Serve!\u201d\\n\\n\r\n+ Faithfully adapts the manga to be even better than its original source.\\n\r\n+ Shounen-style cooking, with fanservice done right \\n\r\n+ Fun and hilarious cast of characters\\n\r\n+ Training Camp arc and Autumn Elections arc\\n\r\n+ Great OPs and EDs and background music.\\n\r\n- Does get predictable sometimes, and ends in the middle of an arc\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.4/10",

            "content": "This was one of those shows I've always browsed past when looking for anime to watch. I thought the story would be nonsensical and a cheap gimmick to show T&A but decided to give it a shot, and man what a great show!  \r\nNever did it cross my mind that I would be interested in this show since I'm in my 30s, and on the surface all I thought was \"It's shounen, it's about cooking, and has ecchi.\"  I'm definitely not new to anime as it's been a part of me since childhood, but I'm not on obsessive levels about it either.I try to watch shows objectively, and I'm more interested in the entertainment & production value of shows, or uniqueness/novelty of plots.  \\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, shokugeki no soma reeled me in with its characters of all things.  This show is all about feel good moments which you can expect in most shounens.  \\n\\n\r\nI can appreciate the MC not being OP, or overcoming challenges with just sheer will power, or having the \"one of a kind character with unique abilities that are different than everyone else\" trope.  Since the MC is just a normal guy, he puts in constant effort in order to stand on par with the \"elites.\"  The MC has lived his modest life unembellished by surroundings influences and thrives  through his own love of cooking. He wins some battles, loses some battles, makes hilarious mistakes, but gradually walks through life together with his friends behind great resolve.  The MC is firmly grounded in his roots as an individual and stands by his own beliefs.  His friends and piers admire the way he approaches his own life in general, which pours out through his cooking as well.  This is the underlying theme of the show.  \\n\\n\r\nThe cooking aspect of the show is really only used as a medium to fill content with, and even still with that being said you can see that the creators of this show make an honest effort to show the audience fresh & interesting cooking content.   \\n\\n\r\nOut of all the familiar anime plot tropes of conquering challenges, falling in love, playing sports, surviving death games, winning supernatural action fights, or psychological thrillers, this show chose cooking.  There is an infinite amount of future content within this medium, which makes me happy.  I really fell in love with this show despite a GREAT reluctance to even watch the first episode.     \\n\\n\r\nIt's funny because I'm sure many would pass this show as \"food porn with ecchi girls,\" but honestly, the ecchi elements are done very tastefully, YES PUN INTENDED.  No but seriously, every ecchi moment is done in satirical way to depict how epic the food created is.  It's used very cleverly and sometimes it legitimately makes me LOL in my room.  It's not used in an overtly perverted manner to show striped anime panties.\\n\\n\r\nDownload worthy song from the show: Song of Hope (Vol 2 OST).  One of my favorite songs EVER.\\n\\n\r\nFavorite character:  Megumi.  She is an awesome character throughout, even to the point of making me remember my highschool days of shy girls who were strangely attractive through their sincerity IRL.  It's hard for a show to make me feel that way, since falling in love with characters is not really something I focus on when watching anime, but this show managed to do that.  The only other character that currently comes to mind that really makes me fall in love with them from an attractive perspective as a guy would be someone like Isshiki Iroha from SNAFU.\\n\\n\r\nAll in All a fantastic show with tons of content which genuinely keeps you hooked because of the challenges and characters presented within the show, while simultaneously remaining true to the shounen title.\\n\\n\r\nHighly recommend this show for anyone, even if you hate cooking.  It's surprisingly excellent.",

Wearing only an apron in public... you get the picture. \r\nAs soon as you see red haired naruto slap on his headband you know it\u2019s on. So time for a simple review from a very simple minded man.\r\nStory, very enjoyable, standard opening of world got flipped turned upside down leading into a tsundere love interest as per. The one thing that sets it appart is steaks. They show the main characters goals right away and show you that it isnt justa 1 man bulldozer of eggs, but he can lose. Not just that but it has good reason for failing him and its how he overcomes this failure that makes the story good.\\n\\n\r\nArt, those dynamic backgrounds and food that actually makes you hungry, more importantly the half naked women are drawn perfectly. For the ladies, Ishhiki\u2019s ass is on full view for 90% of his screen time and is oddly alluring, no homo.\\n\\n\r\nSound, good music choice, I keep hearing something like the apprentice music at the end which makes me smile more than it should. The constant moans and grunts are both pleasurable and the reason I can never watch this without headlhones.\\n\\n\r\nCharcter, good charcter arcs which actually show progression and growth.  Erina is still a tsun by the end and shows no change in the best by default bow to me attitude though a softer side is teased which is archetypal tsun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall really enjoyable with unique characters and you can actually learn cooking theories from watching, its practical so it wasnt 8 hours of sitting on my ass all day for nothing. Id recommend the sub over the dub as the 3rd season of the sub has started and the dub for s2 hasnt yet and Im an impatiant bastard.",

Although it is not the most complex work the show still manages to have intense sequences and plot. Ecchi is glaringly unavoidable but I think it is \"tasteful\" (in relative anime terms, i.e. non-offensive and mainly silly) and adds to the entertainment.  The most distinguishing feature is the overall impressiveness of the show and the most distinguishing flaw is the last 1/3 of the episodes which are not as strong as the preceding 2/3.  \r\nThis show is easily digestible because: the music feels energetic and light, the animation is brilliantlycolorful and detailed, and the themes are rather feel-good. The characters are full of geist and it shows through their individual responses to the various, unique challenges they face. I also enjoy the blending of settings like between the homely Polar Star dormitory and the cutthroat academy it houses for. \\n\\n\r\nI do recognize there exists an entire sub-genre of non-fighting shounen, so those who are already familiar may feel diferently.  But, Shokugeki no Souma is my first experience to a non-fighting shounen and I highly regard for all it is and especially its showcase of culinary ingenuity; it was very fun to watch!",

            "content": "// I\u2019m happy to serve you this fresh, fresh review. Contains traces of spoilers.//\r\nLiving in a modern Japan is harsh. Especially when you study at the best culinary school in existence where almost all the females melt from your food and most other students want you defeated in one of the countless food wars. That\u2019s Shokugeki no Souma.\r\nStory:\r\n\tThe plot starts extremely fast, making little room for introductions or plausible excuses. Main hero is thrown into a culinary school with a very low chance of graduation because of a strict curriculum. This anime seems like your typical high school setting with a considerable amount of timedevoted to conceal this issue. \u2018It\u2019s not your typical shounen set up in an educational facility!\u2019, screams the plot. And while the broad canvas remains the same \u2013 clich\u00e9 characters and power level measuring and so forth, there is a good amount of details to help you forget about this, if that is your wish. The main strength of plot Shokugeki no Souma lies in not treating itself seriously. Only in this way can the inspirational quotes and tense (but predictable) food battles go hand-in-hand with figural tentacles and deep moaning. \\n\r\nThe only plot issue, apart from its simplicity, lies in incredibly high stakes of each episode: don\u2019t cook a good meal \u2013 get expelled, don\u2019t pass a test \u2013 get expelled, don\u2019t win a food war \u2013 get expelled and have your restaurant destroyed. It makes a show predictable, because the protagonist can\u2019t lose \u2013 then we would be left with no show at all. Typical episode of Shokugeki no Souma uses the same repetitive model: protagonist is challenged by secondary character of the week, protagonist makes food, protagonist wins. As a result, the most you can get out of the episode is some awesome recipes and details of every single story. And every recipe is either taken from some national cuisine or is created as a mash of them, which means that it can be recreated exactly like that in real life. Maybe without the tentacles, though. The story is predictable, the outcome is determined most of the time, but the details are what makes the experience actually good, same story as with Gintama.\\n\r\nThis does somewhat change in the second half of the series, where the serious part of the plot truly begins to shine. It doesn\u2019t take control of the story, of course: we still see a light-hearted ecchi shounen, but the progression and the competition start to make more sense. With all that being said, there is definitely enough going in each episode to entertain you.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n\tThe protagonist of the story, Souma, (almost) always wins in food wars because he cooks well and because he is incredibly careless. Had he been careful (or smart) enough to start thinking about his actions, he would have never won a single one of them. To quote one of the other characters, \u201che doesn\u2019t know when to quit\u201d. This works for the anime as a whole: make it even a little bit more serious, more intellectual, more thoughtful, and it becomes dull and boring. Shokugeki no Souma is stupid, knows it and rolls with it. And it works.\\n\r\nSomething works for Souma though: he is incredibly savvy and creative when it comes to cooking. Quick-witted, he always finds a way to bend the rules and win, producing another one of his spectacular meals and \u2018Happy to serve!\u2019 catchphrase. Early on we find out he is like that because of a fierce competition with his father, and this fact plays a great deal in developing his character. Actually one of the reasons why Souma is that good and can compete with most of the other members comes from this obsession to outperform. It also makes for a great sub-plot and a main point that makes or breaks your enjoyment. If you can relate to the struggle Souma (or/and any secondary characters with him) experiences, this show can be really good for you, otherwise \u2013 not so much.\\n\r\nOther minor characters serve as a way of reminding us of the bigger picture outside of Souma\u2019s perspective. They are also a source of some of the best-written and closest to real life dorm jokes I\u2019ve ever heard. There is a shy girl, an energetic girl, some tsundere girls, tsundere guy, guy in the glasses, some members of the elite in the school and various staff members. Usual shounen stereotypes also apply here, and they all get some screen time and backstory, even if just a little bit. We do not always witness them performing, but they also grow, have their own reasons for studying and graduating. It is a solid sneak peak into lives of other people, and it really helps with the experience.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\n\tAnimation is\u2026 good. In fact, it is really good. The art style follows a trustworthy J.C.Staff scheme: broad range of colours, but not too bright, distinct character design, focus on most powerful moments of the show, while simultaneously cutting corners on other aspects. In terms of modern art it meets most standards and probably will not leave you disappointed, unless you are too picky about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\n\tVoice actors do a pretty good job emphasising character traits. They fit the characters pretty good and actually become memorable as the time goes on. As this is an ecchi title, a lot of time is put into good sound, so no complains on this behalf. Background music is mostly spot-on and really enhances the experience. You also become addicted to the first OP of the series. I know I did.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\n\tNo matter what the popular opinion claims, Shokugeki no Souma is not unique in any of the main concepts it represents. There is, however, still much to learn and enjoy from this series: the food recipes, the different techniques, the difficulty of a dormitory life or a life of a student in a top-grade educational facility, even the social class difference between people. It would have been quite generic if it wasn\u2019t for the extensive amount of details on cooking and some time devoted to secondary characters. Shokugeki no Souma doesn\u2019t make a breakthrough in the genre. Rather, it nails what it already has with a mix of comedy, drama and a little bit of alcohol to spice the meal.\\n\\n\r\nScore: Story (6*40%) + Characters (7*30%) + Animation (7*15%) + Sound (8*15%) + Enjoyment (+0) = 6.75\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Achievement: Full Immersion (got food poisoning while watching the series)\\n",

            "content": "How do I even begin? Well, I'll start off by saying that this isn't a show you should be watching with an empty stomach. The show serves heaps and heaps of fanservice, and more importantly \"foodservice\" in each episode. I'll also say that it isn't a show that you should take too seriously. The absurdity of the show is actually what makes it great. The show's formula is like a giant joke based on shounen anime, but instead of beating some bad guy with mystical powers the main character is beating busty, pretentious food snobs with perfectly-cooked  fried rice and eggs. Unless you can'tget over the fan service or quirky sense of humor that the show has, you'll probably enjoy the absurdity of the show and the really neat cooking tips you'll learn throughout.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're trying the show for the first time, give the show a few episodes to sink in. Once you develop a taste for its flavor, and once the other characters start getting introduced, you'll see why such a weird/perverted show has a high rating. Shokugeki no Souma only cares about entertaining you, and it does a damn fine job.\\n\\n\r\n**Spoilers below**\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't anything special. Main character is accepted into a prestigious academy, joins a dormitory past its glory days, meets a tsundere, meets a dandere, male friends, and some other '-deres', and competes against pedigreed opponents from all around the world at cooking. The students at the academy are put into a pressure-cooker environment, and main character is extremely competent and overcomes pretty much every challenge. We've all seen that formula before, but it doesn't matter. The story only exists as a framework to deliver the other elements of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound fit perfectly into what the show is trying to achieve. Everything is drawn with an attractive variety of colors that emphasize contrast, and though it wasn't technically impressive it was solid enough and pleasant to look at. The food in particular is drawn incredibly well. The character voices were fitting, and the epic music soundtrack seriously enhances the intensity of the shokugeki scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters category is what really elevated the show. By the end of season 1 we have a huge variety of characters to root for/against, and almost all of them have backstory to them. Particularly good was the overall progression of Megumi Tadokoro, who has a much more compelling story than the MC and provides the most satisfying victories in the show. Combined with the humor and feel-good antics that everyone else brings to the table by the end of season 1, you'll walk away wondering what the producers can do to top this in season 2.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I gave it a 9. Just like Megumi's cooking, while the show isn't that impressive in a technical sense it has a shockingly potent charm to it that will keep you coming back for more.",

            "content": "This is one of those animes that I couldn't recommend more.\r\nThe food is absolutely amazing and as a person who loves cooking I've tried a bunch of the recipes from the anime and they leggit work. I am just impressed. It shows the passion for food, cooking and the grueling life of a chef. The manga writer wanted to make that point and I think the anime shows it damn well. If you aren't a fan of cooking I wouldn't be surprised if this turned you into one. Solely because of that I think anyone can enjoy this anime. There are more seasons after thisone and oh boy are they all good.The character development is there along with the absolutely stunning art. I mean if you can draw and animate food that makes me loose my shit then you are doing a great job.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly have no clue as to why people hate it that much and I would like to address some of the reasons. It is often tagged as ecchi and I honestly do not see why. Compared to other ecchi anime it is completely innocent. It gets that tag since when people in the anime eat really good food they almost have orgasmic reactions. That is just an attempt at a very vivid reaction to something really good and I see nothing really ecchi about that. People say the character development is bad and I simply don't see that. Some develop more and others less which is pretty realistic compared to real life.\\n",

Seriously. I suspect this show just wasn't their style, in which case I don't know why they continued watching it.\r\nI'm extremely picky with my anime. Ya gotta be, there's so much out there, and everyone likes something different. Instead of being a pretentious douche about it, I'll tell you what I like and if it seems to be yourstyle as well, check out this show. \\n\\n\r\n- The synopsis is pretty standard, the story is eh, but the show is still really enjoyable.  I'm a fan of slice-of-life stories, so I don't care if we're hurtling towards some great outcome, I just enjoy the show.\\n\r\n- Art style is one of the most important things for me, and I really liked the style here.  This anime is very aware of other anime, and pokes fun at a lot of them with its style. Otherwise it's very cute, and I really enjoy all the ecchi scenes. ALL OF THEM. Funny way to show taste, in a show about FOOD. \\n\r\n- There are too many characters, so the main ones don't get a lot of development, and some are stereotypical.  BUT they need a lot of characters to diversify the battles and school. Otherwise it's just Soma v Challenger, Soma v Challenger, Soma v Challenger.  It wouldn't work without them.  And it would be boring if it were just Polar Star. Also it's not a serious show, so there's not serious development. Again, it's just enjoyable. Yes there's a lot of moe, I'm totally fine with that.\\n\r\n- It's a funny show, it's not meant to be serious, seems a lot of people are missing that. It will seriously make you hungry though.  The fictional food looks amazing, and makes me want to cook and eat only amazing gourmet things.",

            "content": "This is my first anime review on this site, and I thought: what better to start with than a show I know probably above any other in my collection. \r\nShokugeki no Soma doesn't appeal to a small collection of people: with as many tropes as it can sneak in there (and I do mean sneak because it is not particularly tropey in any one way) Shokugeki really is a show that is quick to pick up and easy to enjoy. That said, there is one caveat, in that if you cannot finding yourself enjoying the following three things, then this show is not for you:it's over-the-top humor and overblown scale, food (because you must hate life to not love food), or anything remotely ecchi. Because the first thing that would turn anyone away from this series, particularly in the early episodes, is ecchi. \\n\\n\r\nWith that preamble out of the way, we can discuss what makes Shokugeki a pretty compelling show, at least for me. Well for starters, the charm of this show is primarily based on the characters, who honestly all are memorable and likable despite their simplistic designs and philosophies. Shokugeki reminds us that just because you have a shonen protagonist, he is neither vanilla milk toast that is simply pushed to fight the bad guy, nor is he some overpowered Kirito that makes his battles uninteresting to watch. Being somewhere in the middle but leaning on the overpowered side, Food Wars constantly shows us the joy and thrill of learning how Soma will come out on top, despite the fact that the audience knows how capable he is and even that he will come out on top more times than not. While not necessarily a cliffhanger-heavy series, the show keeps its audience on its toes and hanging by suspense simply because often times, the stakes of Soma losing a cooking fight are always so high. \\n\\n\r\nWith the danger of the situations Soma and his classmates find themselves so often, it can come off admittedly as artificial sometimes and the reader will notice a pattern of how plot is resolved in the face of impossible odds. However, I continually come back to rewatch these episodes for more reason than needing to know what comes next. What really stays is the out-of-this-world charisma of all the characters and how much nerve they show in ways that would make the manliest Shonen characters go cross-eyed with envy. \\n\\n\r\nSoma. He's. Got. Balls. \\n\\n\r\nMore Balls than would need to revive Krillen over the span of a three decade series. This guy... is seriously the coolest main character to ever exist. And generally speaking, every girl in this anime is best girl. It's just a matter of (hehe) taste. You got diamond-in-the-rough Megumi, tsundere-queen Erina, and the ditzy-genius Alice. And no one will really fault you for liking any of them, because they're all great girls. The side characters don't get too much screentime, but enough to definitely put a smile on your face whenever they show up. \\n\\n\r\nPhew. I talked a lot, so I'm just going to bullet point the rest. \\n\\n\r\nArt- 8/10\\n\r\nJC Staff isn't known to create the most detailed artwork, and some might long for the beautiful coloring of the manga. However, I think the anime adaptation is extremely competent and consistent. It won't have the /sakuga/ rapid-fire chopping pan flipping you might expect from an anime of this caliber, and those shots are usually relegated to freeze frames. However, it's serviceable enough to enjoy the anime and never feel let down with gloopy in-between frames. \\n\\n\r\nSound- 9/10\\n\r\nA very competent and memorable soundtrack that makes you feel the heat (heh) as the characters are revving up. There are a few tracks that you'd pull off of the OST to listen on your own time, and the OPs and ED are very solid. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\nWithout needing the \"oh-so-darkness-inside-me\" character, the characters in this anime will show us the best sides of the any character trope, and show how even as they are, they can be total baddasses. However, don't expect some in-depth character study about the idea of motivation and development. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -10/10\\n\r\nFun, Exciting, Easy to get into. A great watch and rewatch, worth some smiles and tears on the occasion. \\n\\n\r\nOverall -10/10 You want hype with a side of pickled plums? Coming right up. \\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Listen well, S\u014dma, the secret to becoming a great chef is... meeting a woman that will make you want to give all the food you make to her...\" -  Jouichirou Yukihira, Soma\u00b4s father\r\nIn the recent years, it is more common to find more cooking programs on television, as they have an important role in our society and above all, they are entertaining. Most of media have been influenced by them, including otaku culture.  \r\nShokugeki no Souma (also known as orgasmic cooks) is an anime which has gotten a lot of popularity in the last years. That is why it has got a sequela few months ago, which is currently airing. The story begins in a Japanese Restaurant, which is run by the Yukihira family. \\n\\n\r\nYukihira Soma, a guy in his mid-teens, had spent his entire life helping his father in the family restaurant and his dream is to run his father's restaurant in the future. People adore them and the restaurant is a huge success. Nevertheless, everything changes when his father decides to travel around the world to test his cooking habilities. He decides to send his children to Totsuki Academy, one of the best cooking school in Japan and well-known for the competitions among students, the shokugeki or food wars.\\n\\n\r\nSeries follows day by day, the different tasks which Yukihira have to complete to remain on the academy. He is very prideful and impulsive person and as a result he will be in very complicated and critical situations. Also this personality will awake the interest of his teachers and will be the beginning of a friendship with lots of students, as well as the hate of others students. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the characters, two characters deserve special mention. \\n\\n\r\n-Erina Nakiri, the main female character in the story and the grandaughter of the director. She is one of the Elite Ten Council, the best students in the academy and wants to be no. 1 in Totsuki Academy. She is confident and arrogant, specially with Yukihira due to a conflict in first episodes. \\n\\n\r\n-Megumi Tadakoro is the second main female in the story, along with Erina. She comes from a port town. She is a very shy, clumsy girl whose main ambition is to become a great chef in the future and make their family to be proud of her. She has one the best character development and she will grow stronger with the help of Soma, who will be his best support and will become one of his best friends. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is very interesting, as everyone have their own cooking styles and their own personality. This includes the residents of the Polar Star Dormitory, where a part of the main cast resides, including Tadakoro and Soma; Hisako Arato, the secretary of Erina Nakiri; Izumi Mito, ally of Erina Nakiri etc...\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is fantastic, especially when cooks display foods. Character design is good as well. Even the filler characters are well-designed, although they all have the same hair, as most of the animes of this style.\\n\r\nFood sometimes produces in the customers an enjoyment similar to an orgasm, popularly called foodgasm, which is very disturbing and funny to watch at the same time (Do not forget to lower the sound). \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is very addictive, specially the second opening Rising Rainbow and second ending Sacchan no Sexy Curry. The rest of the soundtrack is very repetitive during the entire series, but well-recieved, because some of the tracks are amazing, such as The Secret Ingredient Called Victory or Food Wars - Epic SoundTrack. \\n\\n\r\nAfter all this description, what is the most important characteristic of this anime series? The enjoyment. \\n\r\nIt is not a masterpiece, it is not even close. But it is enjoyable. Every episode is funny to watch. It is nice to see how characters behave and interact, how Soma challenges people, even several of the best students in the academy, how Erina easily gets angry with Soma, how Tadokoro gets scared but face her fears.\\n\\n\r\nAll the situations are very predictable, you can easily get what it is going to happen next. But it is not a bad anime. The plot is very simple, but it is entertaining. And I recommend everyone, not only if you are interested in cooking, but also if you want to spend good moments with these quirky cooks. Then take a look of the manga, you will enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\n\"Happy to serve!\"\\n",

I'm just judging this series as your normal avid anime watcher. So here's my thought, I did not expect to be enthralled by the series since it's about cooking. \r\nJust to elaborate my review further.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nThe story is well paced and it follows a straight direction. It is not rushed nor it was boring. The competition is the drive of the story .I have finished both season in just two days, which I rarely do nowadays and I cancertainly say that it's the story and the competition that kept me up to finish it in a short period of time.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe character design and as well the details in the anime has depth and flavor. I liked the way how they portrayed the characters reaction.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nI don't know about its closeness to realistic cooking but whenever they want to emphasize something, they also make use of the sound which I think in my opinion is not bad! I liked the OST and especially, it features two of my favorite bands, Screen mode and nano.RIPE. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nThe character development in the series played an important role in the series since it's one of the main foundation of the story. The main characters have depth, though the minor characters background story falls short and some are too shallow.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nThe comedy, the suspense, the competition, also a small bits of drama, these combinations made the series fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI can certainly that it's a great series. I recommend it to anyone.\\n",

They made the head of the rival shop way too cartoonishly evil, which takes away from experience), and mostly succeeding in it. But, unlike Bakuman, it doesn't possess any character development. In Bukuman our mains and rivals constantly evolved not just as artists, but as human beings. They changed and carried viewer with them. Nothing of such is present in Souma. Characters evolve as cooks, but remain the same as when they were first introduced.\r\nScenes with over sexualizing food did not add anything except, wellecchi. At first they were funny (Megumi in honey) but after repeating way too many times they mostly annoyed. The show used better ways to describe experiences from food, i.e. - when Erina was first introduced her descriptions were actually interesting and understandable.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Souma is nice, except that it suffers from a common anime disease of using spandex instead of real clothes (i.e. - breasts are always accentuated as if there were special pockets for them in the clothing, even for the gap in between).\\n\\n\r\nThe main way Souma wins the viewer is it's theme - food. Absolutely everyone can relate to that, even those who don't cook themselves would find the process enthralling. The theme and mostly realistic approach to the process (as a person with basic skills of cooking for himself can judge, I felt that only in Election arc there was some magic involved) with explanations is the main strength of the show.",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Soma is an amazing cooking anime that I'd recommend to pretty much any shounen anime fan. The art, the characters, the pacing, the HYPE, it's all really fine-tuned. As much as I enjoyed it however, there are a few problems with it.\r\nStory: The story really is your typical shounen anime scenario. The underdog no one expects manages to pull victories out of nowhere continuously. It also plays on all the classic tropes of shounen anime, which might sound tedious at first, but it feels amazingly fresh due to everything revolving around cooking. The main issue here however is that eventually you'll start findingthe formula stale, seeing how pretty much every cook-off is about how the underdog wows everyone else spectacularly. But, the show has enough unique twists to keep things fresh and keep you excited for what's next. Although these twists might not work for every viewer, and it also depends on how much you actually care about the dishes they put out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation budget is pretty decent for this anime, nothing TOO amazing, but it does it's job. However, the character designs are top notch here, and almost every main character in the show has a well thought out design that defines their personality along with just looking pretty damn good. Supposedly, the artist originally drew hentai before this, and you can definitely see this influence due to all the beautiful women and ecchi scenes that push the limit. But the guys look just as good, so it's not one-sided or anything :P\\n\\n\r\nSound: Pretty decent soundtrack, I'd say it was a bit above average. There are still some songs from the OST that still remain in my head. Both openings and endings are amazing too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The main characters are great in this anime, no doubt about that.\\n\r\nA lot of them still follow classic tropes, but the writer manages to make many of them pretty endearing. The relationships and interactions between the characters is definitely one of the high points of the anime. But this anime suffers a similar problem as other shounen animes, and that's with how the cast gets over-saturated and the writer has trouble making them all relevant. This season ends with a clever way to bring them back all into the spotlight and give them their shot at glory, but it did feel slightly forced, along with feeling a bit boring due to the sudden shift in focus and lack of effort in execution.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If I could have, I would have just sat down and watched through each episode straight, back-to-back. The characters drew me in, and I loved seeing how they got themselves out of every situation. This was truly one of the greatest shounen experiences I've had.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I want to give this anime a 9, but there really are numerous factors that hold it back to an 8. The over-reliance on shounen tropes are definitely a negative, but I feel like they can be ignored enough to just let yourself enjoy the show. I feel that it's supposed to be a silly show, so getting too serious over it might affect any enjoyment you gain from it.",

Although they stick to the genre of the anime, which is food, they placed way to many characters in this anime.\r\nThe plot continuity is still very well done, I just feel that with a little less useless characters, they could have spent a lot more time on the main characters and made sure that all of them under went character development throughout the anime. In the end I feel only two main characters had the mostdevelopment.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end it was still a very good anime overall, so I would still recommend this anime if you want a change of pace.",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Soma. \r\nThis is a very good anime but too many reviews here don't take into account the tedious parts of the story line or the predictability.  My review will concentrate more on the negatives - especially since most of the reviews here already concentrate on the positives.\r\nMost of all - don't get me wrong - it is a very good anime!  It's just not \"10\" worthy.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nThe anime revolves around Soma Yukihira, a teenage chef, whose only real desire is to surpass his father as such.  The anime follows Soma to Totsuki Academy where he joins other high caliberteen chefs looking to learn and make a name for themselves.  There are battles between the students but the majority of the time you'll be watching teachers and judges reactions to the foods these chef's create.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is where the \"tedious\" part came in for me.  Towards the end I was finding myself skipping through the \"reactions\" just to see the end results.  You already have a sense that specific characters will outdo other ones and that there's really no need to watch the reactions for some of them.  \\n\\n\r\nFurther into the story I found myself asking why the judges didn't actually Subtract points from certain characters (the Italian brothers for example) for not showing any ingenuity with their dishes.  No Japanese chef ever thought of combining Italian and Japanese dishes before?  Just a small problem there, for me, in the belief department.\\n\\n\r\nThere are no surprises.  I expect a couple of surprises but it seems the story line is very predictable.  There was nothing in the story that I found unpredictable and found myself bored more than a couple of times.\\n\\n\r\nAlso - while there are supposedly battles between these young chef's - we only get to see a handful of these battles over the 24 episodes.  The battles are there to reward the winner and punish the loser but there's only 1 real battle that I can think of that showed this to any degree. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation - 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very good - better than some.  There is no worrying about mixing up characters as they are all very different from one another.  I did notice that some animation sequences were used again in different episodes but in new parts of the story.  I don't care to see the same animation again unless it's a revisit scene to the original.  There's a couple of places that it was apparent and the animation itself wasn't anything brilliant.  The lines are clean and the animation is well done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7.5/10\\n\r\nHaving just finished watching \"Detroit Metal City\" I can say that the soundtrack music is nothing extraordinary with this animation.  It is better than some but it's nothing ground breaking.  The sound is clean and the music is okay.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nA large cast that all have their own characteristics that really separate them from the rest.  \\n\\n\r\nSoma Yukihira is the protagonist and has a big chip on his shoulder when it comes to his father.  The problem I have with him is that even he doesn't have much of a backstory.  He just ends up flashing back to all the time he and his father were cooking.  He doesn't know squat about his father's history and he'd never bothered to ask him about the calls from people using different languages?\\n\\n\r\nMegumi Tadokoro is clumsy, adorable, and has a strong will to succeed.  At first you can see her using Soma as a crutch but as the story moves forward she really starts to shine on her own.\\n\\n\r\nErina Nakiri is the ultimate \"Tsundere\".  To a point that she's more irritating than interesting.  The probability that her character could exist in the real world is almost zero.  If she's the \"Golden Tongue\" and eats a meal that's fantastic then in real life she'd want to know \"why\" it's better.  In this story she's only interested in pedigree and her ego is bigger than her \"Golden Tongue\".  While it may be normal in some instances in real life it's definitely not normal for chef's who go out of their ways to find the best foods - no matter where they might be located.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros :\\n\r\n1. It has some good comedic moments\\n\r\n2. It's entertaining\\n\r\n3. The character interactions are fun to see\\n\\n\r\nCons :\\n\r\n1. Believability is forgotten in some instances\\n\r\n2. A couple of the characters are too far over the top \\n\r\n3. Animation sequences used again but in different story lines\\n\r\n4. No real surprises\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10 \\n\r\nIt's a fun anime to watch and I recommend it.",

            "content": "There are a millions things I can complain about when it comes to this anime, especially after reading the manga, but honestly, it's really enjoyable.\r\nUsing cooking as a way of competition, at a school so strict you could be expelled for using scented shampoo, makes the concept of this show interesting in itself. It does get slow sometimes, especially at the end, where I found myself skipping forward to \"get to the point\" during the loooong explanations of what a dish is and what the characters used to make it, but once you get through those, it's really fast-paced and exciting. The downside of itbeing fast-paced really hurts the many minor characters, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really good, there is nothing I can complain about. The characters look amazing, the dishes look amazing, the buildings, rooms and other backgrounds also bring out the depth of situations well.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are great, really fitting and, in my opinion, really good songs. The background music... I didn't take much notice of it, so it wasn't distracting, at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are overall pretty good, all of them have distinct personalities and their own roles in the main character's development. The anime does fail to bring out the background stories of the minor characters, though, probably because of the limitations of screen-time.\\n\\n\r\nIt is definitely an anime worth watching, though I don't feel like it does the story justice. Getting so far in the story in just 24 episodes was never supposed to happen, which can be seen by how the anime ENDS right before the final of the tournament. It literally has the whole tournament, except for the finals. Why?\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would say it's good, I really liked it, seeing the various dishes is really interesting. I'll also just casually throw in here that you can find a lot of the recipes in the manga. So should you watch it? Yes. Is it going to be an amazing, life-changing experience? No. Does it have potential as an anime in the future? Definitely. Now go watch this.",

            "content": "The Video Review is up on my Channel, but here is the Written Review.\r\nWho would\u2019ve thought a show about cooking can be so fun and exciting, there\u2019s ecchi, but it\u2019s used cleverly and doesn\u2019t distract too much from the awesome food showcases.\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nTotsuki Culinary Academy, a school dedicated to training student chefs to become the top chefs in the world. Because they aim to have the top chefs in the world, the school is extremely strict to the point where only 10% of Students usually graduate. This is the setting of the show. The story follows the Soma Yukihira as he aims to bethe number one chef in the world, but in order to do that he must beat his father, who has a winning record of 489 to 0. Initially Soma was just going to graduate middle school and take over the family restaurant; however his dad decided to get a job overseas and sends Soma to Totsuki to challenge him and kind of help improve his cooking. That is the initial premise of the story, and there a multiple arcs as the show progresses.\\n\\n\r\nAt first the story pacing is kind slow as the plot doesn\u2019t really seem to go anywhere for the first few episodes, because it felt like a really long introduction before anything at stake starts happening. You\u2019ll also notice they spend quite a bit of time talking about the food that was just eaten and they really get into detail about it. And for a show that is called \u2018Shokugeki\u2019 and Shokugeki\u2019s are basically a battle between chefs to decide who\u2019s better, and unfortunately there\u2019s really only 2 main Shokugeki\u2019s. There\u2019s a bit of a minor distraction in the middle of the series. And the show ended on a cliffhanger. However after the initial introduction episodes the story really picks up and gets interesting as the stakes get higher. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSoma Yukihira is the main protagonist of Shokugeki. His aim to become the number one chef at totsuki. His character is full of confidence and never really shows any signs of concerns. Now initially, his character was made to look unstoppable and that he could not falter. However this is not the case as the show goes on, we see vulnerability in Soma, as he\u2019s sort of an outsider to education in culinary and he learns from his mistakes and puts what he learnt to use later on. And that is what I love about his character, his cocky, but he has faults and he acknowledges them. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main of the show is Megumi Tadakoro. Now Megumi probably gets the most development in the whole anime. Her role at first initially resembles the innocent useless girl, but however she is actually rather talented. She just doesn\u2019t know it and just lacks the confidence. So as the show progresses we see Megumi gain more confidence as she works together with Soma. And we really get to see the end result of that development towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nOne character on the surface doesn\u2019t look like she has development but actually is shown quite a bit of another side to her, and that is the other main Erina Nakiri. At first Erina is there to be intimidating, the best chef in the year level. And if I wasn\u2019t for her stuck up tsundere personality, you probably would've had an easier time seeing her development. What I mean we get to see a softer side of her, and we see her acknowledging other people\u2019s dishes as the series progress, except Soma\u2019s, because she has a grudge against Soma. Not only that she is one of Soma\u2019s driving force, as makes a vow to make her like his dishes. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of cast there is actually quite a diverse number of different types of characters. Every character seems to have their own purpose in the show and they are all likeable in different ways. There are characters who can claim to be Soma\u2019s ally, rival and mentors and it feels like they all play a role in Soma\u2019s journey to learning the ways of cooking. What I love about all the characters is that they all show signs up development. Even the mentors learning from their students and almost of the whole cast show their development in the second half, meaning their time on screen aren\u2019t wasted space. They all have their unique personalities and their interactions with each other are often hilarious and entertaining. Also they are rather interesting with different backgrounds which is reflecting on their cooking style.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 8/10, 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation art style is rather standard. The background and environments are nothing special. And the cooking scenes are kind of disappointing because most of the time it\u2019s just still shots for the majority of the time, only a few times in the anime do we get to see some animated cooking. However the animation and art shines brightest when the final product is shown and the evaluation period begins. First of all the food cooked in the anime looks so delicious, I\u2019m so jealous that I can\u2019t cook like that, and you also get a sense of feel what looks good over the other. But let\u2019s talk about the evaluation period, what\u2019s unique about this anime is its use of ecchi and fan service in some ways. Every time a delicious dish is eaten the consumer goes into a fantasy world taken by the food. At first the ecchi was pretty over the top, but it gets toned down a bit and goes back up towards the end. But some of these fantasy scenes are gorgeous to look at, and the hilarity that is ensued in those scenes is what makes it so enjoyable. There is so many unique different types of scenes for each evaluation and they all look stunning. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing; I could sit here and listen to it all day. Each track really adds the scene, whether there is more light hearted and emotional moments, to the intense cook offs and the evaluations. My highlights were especially during the cooking when the orchestral music just feels you with adrenaline with its fast upbeat tone. And the tasting music makes the scene so suspenseful and the anticipation builds up perfectly for the fantasy world music by the judges. Each track just gets your heart pumping and exhilarating. The opening and the ending of the anime are awesome as well, with openings with the shounen esc styles and ending that is catchy and makes you feel at home and calm.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Soma wouldn\u2019t have been so fun and exciting if it didn\u2019t have the shounen trait it have. Every episode you are just waiting in anticipation for the next dish or cook off. I was always excited waiting in anticipation for the final product of the dish. The build up towards the dishes are what makes the anime so exciting to watch and there is enough enjoyment out of it, as every episode we are presented with a new dish, which always manages to please our eyes showing us something that looks so delicious each and every episode. However if you\u2019re not familiar with some of the cooking terminology, the descriptions and tasting of each dish could leave you confused as to what is being tasted, which at times for myself was left confused, because I\u2019m not a foodie, however they do try their best explain in a way that even people who are not familiar with food kind of get the gist of what they\u2019re eating. But all in all, each episode was hyped and the build-up to a new dish every episode was very enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\\n\r\nAs we draw towards the end of the Review, I give the story an 7, it has pacing issues. The start is a bit slow and there is a distraction in the middle. However the show ended on a cliff-hanger and hence it\u2019s not completed. It has a rather basic story, one gunning for the top, but the journey is an awesome one at that.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound I give a 8 and 10. The animation and art style is nothing special even when it comes to the cooking scenes. But that\u2019s not to say the food and fantasy world looks gorgeous. Yes the ecchi is kind of off putting, but it tones down as the show goes on and really doesn\u2019t distract too much. The soundtrack however is amazing, every track leaves you hyped for what is coming up next and adds to the atmosphere of each and every scene. Plus the opening and ending themes are great as well.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters they get a 9 from me. Almost every character plays an important part and none of them felt like they weren\u2019t developed, because they were all developed in some ways and it was great to see the different variety and personalities of the characters reflect on their cooking styles. And the development of Soma and Megumi and Erina is really an interesting one as well. The whole cast, including the supporting are all so likeable as well.\\n\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment I give this a 10. This is one of the anime I spent every morning getting up and watching as soon as it was ready for streaming. Every episode felt me up with excitement, just waiting for that next dish to pop up was enjoyable to watch and the fact we got a different dish every episode is what makes the show so exciting to watch. And the comedy is pretty funny, whether it\u2019s the fantasy scenes or even some of the quick-witted humour.\\n\\n\r\nFor the overall score of Food Wars: Shokugeki no Soma, I give it a 9/10. The show keeps it consistent providing us with a new dish every episode and the build-up is what makes it so exciting each episode. I recommend this anime to shounen fans, fans of comedy and if you like cooking you\u2019re going to love this anime. It is such a fun show to watch and one of my favourite anime of the Spring/Summer season",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma is the story of a teenager pursuing his ambition of becoming one of the best chef's in the world.\r\nStory/Plot: 7\r\nBeing a show about food you could expect something very different from mainstream anime,but it exactly the opposite.\r\nShokugeki no Souma is by every account an mainstream show for all the good and bad. Despite the complexity of the dishes and the meticulous preparation they need, the show is very open and an actual interest in culinary is not necessary to enjoy it.\r\nWhen it comes to the plot and without spoiling it, it revolves around an impossibly demanding school of culinary that fails 90%of it's students.\\n\\n\r\nIt's basically a little bit of hell's kitchen in anime form but with a lot of comedy. That comedy comes from the colorful cast of characters but specially from the fact there's a lot of food tasting and a lot of resulting orgasm (not kidding) from tasting that food.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads to hilarious segments of people having their metaphorical clothes explode from the sheer pleasure the food is giving them. This is also where a lot of the fan-service in the show is exploited to make these situations even more bizarre and humorous.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of fan-service, there's a lot of it, some good and some bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe good part is that it's very inclusive in a way there's something for everyone and like i said before it's used to provide comic-relief with great effect.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad part is that it's also used as one of the oldest and cheapest tricks in anime history, which is, giving certain female characters extra \"personality\" in the form of water-melon size breasts. Making them a literal talking pair of boobs. \\n\\n\r\nI wish the author gave them an actual personality and character development instead of something as lazy as this. Fortunately not all female characters suffer from this strange syndrome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nDespite some classical anime stereotypes and overuse of fan-service, the cast of characters is rich and diverse. Giving the show a good amount of different perspectives on cooking and what it means to be a chef.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also managed to make characters stand on their own despite many of them gravitating around the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nAs most of them have a specialty when it comes to types of foods and methods of cooking, it makes latter episodes where there's a lot of cooking competitions much more compelling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma has for the most part very solid production values. Characters look unique in terms of design, and the animation is consistent, especially in the orgasm skits when the author's creativity is put to the test and there's a lot of nudity/absurdity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound/soundtrack: 7\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile not amazing, Shokugeki no Souma has some catchy tunes that complement well the action and gave me a sense of excitement.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound effects and VA's, everything was pretty solid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis has been one of my favorite shows of the year. From the production values, to the art and the fact the show has amazing pacing (no filler episodes) made this a very enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just too bad there's simply too much brainless fan-service.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall score/Conclusion: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to recommend this anime to mostly anyone that likes comedy and slightly more mature shonen shows. Despite it's problems, I'm definitely exited for the next season.",

            "content": "I'm pretty sure that you probably know about the extreme ecchi (people getting organsms when they eat food....etc) in this series. So straight up, I'm just going to say:\r\nDON'T WATCH IT IF YOU GET BOTHERED/HATE ECCHI/FANSERVICE\r\nWATCH IT IF YOU DON'T MIND/ENJOY IT\r\nThat's basically all you need to know, but if you still want the details, here you go:\r\nStory 7/10:\r\nThe story is pretty ordinary and predictable really. A mc who wants to surpass his father, blah blah blah. But the part I like most about the story is the fact that Tostuki is such a strict academy, so there's a lot of suspense every episode withconstant competition between the mc and his rivals and friends. Other than that, there's nothing really significant about the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10:\\n\r\nThe art is good besides from all the fanservice. Its just too overwhelming and extreme.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\r\nI personally thought the soundtrack was great (especially the second opening), but they reused a lot of the same OSTs during the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\r\nSome might argue that the characters in this show are cliche, but I still think they're pretty amazing. Even if they are cliche, they're more like an upgraded version of those characters. Soma is just your typical \"never gives up\", strong but wants to improve character, but I just can't help look up to him because of his spirit and how he helps his friends, even rivals. I also love how minor characters also get to prove how awesome they are in the last part of the show. The negative part about the characters is their development. There's hardly any character development besides Megumi's, so this makes this show not  \"deep\" and stuff, but is that really that bad?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shokugeki no Souma might be on my favorites list, but I have to admit, there are a lot of flaws that need to be fixed in order for this to be a 10/10 show. But still watch this show if you don't mind fanservice.",

            "content": "In the past, there have been various authors who have attempted to create story genera\u2019s that would become a distinct category of their own. There have been those who had success and those who meet with failures. One of these genera\u2019s is Food anime/manga and Shokugeki no Souma is that example which mixes food and shonen aspects of action and suspense so well that\u2026 let\u2019s just say it is freaking outstanding and downright praise worthy. In this review/preview I will tell you as to WHY you should watch this show and be awed by how amazing and creative this show is and it would makeyou hungry every single time you watch it. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start off with the story. You have the main character named Yukihira Souma who runs a restaurant named Yukihira with his father. It\u2019s a small diner that you usually find in small communities all around world in pretty much every city anywhere. Once day, something business related comes up that his father needs to attend and at the right time and his dad Juichiro decided to send Souma to the best chef academy called Toutsuki Academy to learn and become a great and qualified chef within the next 3 years. Souma as a character is very unique and someone who I have rarely encountered in the anime\u2019s I\u2019ve watched. After being in the kitchen with his dad since the age of six, he develops a personality like his father and faces everything head on with a smile on his face. The story sets a goal for Souma after episode one of wanting to become the best chef in Toutsuki\u2019s history. This sets the goal for the story and with it creates a universe with boundless arcs and adventures. He encounters another main character named Nakiri Erina but I can\u2019t get into much of her without spoiling, but I will say that she\u2019s a tsundre and cute!\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I mention Shokugeki no Souma is so unique is because it has action in it. Yes, it has fights but not the type you would ever expect. These are 1vs1 battles fought by individual chefs called Shokugeki\u2019s, where there are conditions are laid out by and agreed upon by both opponents and after they fight it out and see who wins and loses. There are also instances where the chefs who are being looked down upon just want to prove a point that they are more than people ought to see them as. The way these Shokugeki\u2019s and cooking battles are fought and the whole concept of a struggle being portrayed in this manner is what got me so hooked to this show since day one. Most people get turned off by this, because it\u2019s a cooking show and no one really wants to watch it, but I can guarantee you that you will not be disappointed once you finish the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation and soundtrack are really well done. J.C Staff was working on various shows in the spring and summer season of 2015 and they\u2019ve kept up with great animation and consistency with proper character designs voice actors are superb. \\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve been reading Shokugeki no Souma since the very beginning and the animation in my opinion does full justice to the manga from the battles all the way to the pretty much uncensored fan service which is always a kudos for people who are into that sort of thing. I would highly advise people to check this show out as its one of these hidden gems that people would look over just because of the title and its looks. Trust me, you\u2019ll enjoy this show very much if you have similar taste as mine. Thank you for reading this review and I hope you enjoy the show!\\n\r\nshow less",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma is a fairly lighthearted anime that centers around a boy, Yukihira who wants to work his way to the top of the culinary world in order to return to his life as the chef of a casual neighborhood diner. With an anime about delicious food, who wouldn't be hungry after every episode? I really enjoy the different cuisines mentioned and varieties of cooking techniques during the shokugekis (cooking competitions usually used to settle disputes between chefs). \r\nStory: I feel like the story is a bit slow because of all the side character introductions and a bunch of conflict occurrences as well asfiller details, but it is interesting because it really brings you into their world where the quality of food really is everything.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm someone who is pretty picky about artwork in anime. I'd say it's decent. It gets the emotions across, and the detailing of the food is enough to make your mouth water sometimes, but it isn't spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I think that as the story progresses Yukihira grows more as well as Megumi but other than those two, there is not much detailing the lives of the other characters aside from brief mentions. I do like that Yukihira is not immediately the best at what he does, although it's not as though he's not on a competing level with the best. I like that he has to learn new things and improve himself, because it shows that he isn't like the protagonists of some anime who only need to lift a finger to blow everyone away. I also like that his enemies have fight too, and special characteristics that Yukihira lacks himself but he makes up for it through research and relying on his friends and personal experiences.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: I think it's very good for what it is. I enjoyed watching it when it first came out because it branches away from the usual topics of fighting and romance towards a more universal topic that almost anyone can enjoy: watching people cook food. I'm excited for the second season but to be honest I don't like waiting for it so I'm already caught up on the manga. Yay for food wars ^_^",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that I have absolutely never been into this type of anime in the slightest and would even go as far as saying I really disliked them. I have never liked a lot of comedy in anime and especially not for it to be a focus. Never been into slice of life type stuff and have always liek more serious/dark toned anime. All that as well as the fact that i'm not really into cooking more than the next person and certainly don't know a ton about it. I ended up watching Food Wars! on a whim just after seeingand liking the art. I expected to just watch 1-2 episodes and hate it and I was very very wrong.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I can't really even say in particular what the biggest reason is that I loved Food Wars. It of course has a good solid story and as I said before I liked the art. Everything else is solid as well but there is just a good feeling it gives you as you watch. I don't mean a happy go lucky feeling but just a sort of content one I don't know how to explain.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will try to review a few technical aspects of the anime which isn't my strong point.  I like to focus more on how much I liked it and how easy it was to watch but I never everyone likes this aspect as well.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of story Food Wars is pretty solid and though not completely new is very refreshing and at the least is creative. They also don't breeze past things like they do in alot of anime. Alot is shown of most characters history and pasts and why they cook but it also isn't super drawn out to where it get's boring. It's pacing is always very good at the first start though it does begin to get just a bit slow at parts about halfway through. The art is also good being that it's what brought me in at first to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also something I thought was very good in this anime. I usually don't focus to much on it unless it's just horribly bad but I thought in particular it was quite good in this anime. Now the main factor I think for me at least that I loved with Food Wars! was the characters. The mc Soma as i've said in many post is one of my favorites in a long time. He is different from alot of other male mcs and breaks free from alot of the cliches of them and annoying factors about them. He doesn't do stupid things that no human with a brain would do in terms of girls or any other interaction or how he goes about things and he just has an awesome personality that is kind of hard to explain sort of the perfect mix of serious and funny/sarcastic. You just have to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow though it blew my expectations away and it was very good. There where a few things with Food Wars! that could be better and may bother some people though they also may not. I mentioned before the pacing got slower as the series went on. This is mainly because there is a little stretch that though it could be argued it progressed some charrie development and such it seemed alot like filler and for me it's rough seeing 2-3+ episodes of filler in a 12-24 episode series. The second though this won't bother alot of people is alot of romance is hinted at at least mainly on the girls side and it seems like at least in this area Food Wars is gonna do the cliche as most other animes do. Have tons of hints and such at it and hold it off as long as possible then show it at the end for a brief moment though it isn't to bad because it isn't a very big factor in this anime. The last and for me most annoying thing is the judging. If your not familiar enough with the series there are different food battles and competitions and the judging can be quite drawn out and tedious at times. I have also heard from manga readers it only at the least stays the same or get's worse but it's not to horrible just slightly annoying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would give Food wars a 8-8.5 and that is coming from someone who doesn't like this genre or arc types so there ya go. Highly surprised by it definitely.",

I was simply addicted!\r\nBefore watching, I thought the ecchi would really put me off, but actually, it doesn't take away from the plot at all and isn't misogynistic.  Rather, it acts in three forms: comedic relief, mere fan-service for all genders in the audience, as well as a very convincing metaphor for food experience.\r\nBut what I really enjoyed about this anime is how it doesn't waste a moment of your time.There are too many anime shows out there that draw out scenes for dramatic effect, or use static characters as crutches for the plot. This anime, however, takes advantage of every minute it owns!  Every episode was important, each scene was involved in the plot, every character was multi-faceted and all commanded my empathy. \\n\\n\r\nSoma Yukihira has certainly earned a spot on one of my top five favorite anime characters in history.  I seriously enjoyed my time watching these anime  twenty-four episodes and look forward to watching the sequel, as well as the side-plot, along with any other anime that is related to this series!  Fantastic!",

            "content": "Story: it's a Nekketsu with food. There is literally nothing else to say about the story. Characters meet, they fight(with cooking), hero wins(with cooking). If hero loses, it's just so he can come back and win stronger.\r\nArt: For a 2015 anime it's fine.\r\nSound: For a 2015 anime it's fine.\r\nCharacters: it's bad.\r\nIt's really boring and bad and uninteresting. I watched 24 episodes and the only character I ever rooted for was Megumi Tadokoro. The rest barely kept me interested.\r\nEnjoyment: Well, does this \"review\" look to you like I'm just trying to drop this thing harder than an unpinned grenade? If not, then I haven't hammered enoughhow this isn't worth talking about.\\n\\n\r\nYou see Shokugeki isn't good. It delves into several modern trends that really should all die:\\n\\n\r\n-Girls are ridiculously eroticized so we they don't have to write well, orgasms will convey emotions instead of good characters\\n\r\n-Abuse of flashbacks at the worst times\\n\r\n-Too many characters\\n\r\n-Harem slowly being built around a main character that of course will never realise all the girls want to bang him\\n\r\n-Too many stereotypes that aren't done any better than in many other shows\\n\\n\r\nThe general feeling when watching a Shokugeki episode is that it's predictable, it's generic, it's uninteresting, and it's not even done right, nor does it have anything about it that makes it stand out at all. I recently called Kiznaiver a standard anime with standard anime characters, but Shokugeki doesn't even deserve the title of standard, it's a generic anime filled wth stereotypes, a fairly wide cast of anime people that have no depth and just aren't well portrayed at all. \\n\\n\r\nIn the entirety of the 24 episodes I think two or three moments were sort of good, all of them with Megumi Tadokoro. Without these moments this would've earned a 4.\\n\\n\r\nThis show isn't just filled to the brim with boring, overdone stereotypes that make it ultra predictable, it's also a cooking show, and I just have to compare it for a second with the far older and far funnier Mister Ajikko.\\n\\n\r\nAjikko and Shokugeki start in a small diner. A big, important character eats their food and realises that they are sublimely talented. They both start a campaign to prove to the world that they are the best cook ever. They both face many challenges with many opponents and very diverse styles and origins of cuisine. They both meet villains and have to prove them wrong with their cooking.\\n\\n\r\nThe difference is, while Ajikko is a dried old 90s thing with everything wrong with the 90s in it, it manages to keep you watching without needing to shove boobs in your face or make yet another harem of girls who'll never reach those pants. And Ajikko has the merit of being so bad it's genius. The over-the-topness makes it very fun, because characters taking themselves ultra seriously before doing the dumbest things is always fun.\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki isn't fun. \\n\r\nIt's generic nekketsu protagonist + harem of needlessly sexualised girls + generic nekketsu situations where EVERYTHING is predictable + large cast of undevelopped characters. And the result is a completely uninteresting anime.\\n\\n\r\nYes the dishes look great and yes the explanations are veeeeeery complex, to the point that the food fights just last too long, but the poor storytelling with characters constantly talking and explaining is also to be added to the pile of things that make this too generic, too impersonal and too dull.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's just mediocre.\\n\r\nConsistently mediocre with Tadokoro Megumi being sort of the superior part of the series. It's watchable alright, I mean I gulped down all of it in two days, other animes have been more boring or worse. But even when I look back to somewhat boring shows like Himouto Umaru-chan or really boring ones like Dagashi Kashi, I remember that these shows had a certain charm or style or something to themselves and I felt like I'd like to see them again someday.\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki is more like eating a supermarket sandwich. It's edible and it'll quench your hunger, but damn will you want something with more taste. You can watch this if you want \"an anime\", but there is so much better out there.",

A completly normal activity that has its own intricacies, its own competitive world and a chance for sucess as long as you have the talent for it. You find everywhere, from your grandmother's house and campfire barbecue, to the greatest heights of haute cuisine.\r\nA story about the growth of young boy in a world where he aims for the top, in journey along his friends and rivals.\r\nUp until now you'd think this is a cooking version ofa typical shounen. And you'd be mostly right. However, from the moment you start watching this show you'll be surprised at how ridiculous and absurd the fan service is in this show. People have orgasms eating food here. Each scene surpasses the previous one in how crazy it gets. And just when you think you've seen it all, they hit you with something you'd though would not be possible. It takes the ecchi genre to new heights.\\n\\n\r\nNice story. Quite the typical growth MC is gonna win story but I still enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutly refuse to describe or rate those scenes. Go watch it for yourself to see how it is.\\n\\n\r\nNot a lot of character development, but the characters in the show are really cool.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this train wreck of show. It was quite the absurd madness but I still enjoyed it.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nNot higher because my pride won't allow me to give a 9 to a show with those boob physics.",

            "content": "*English is not my first language! Review will be edited... eventually!*\r\nSo, yeah... Food Wars was a total wreck! Tasty wreck, but a wreck, nontherless!\r\nLike many others before me, I honestly cannot say, nor comprehend, why oh why this has such a high ranking! Or rather... I do understand, since I gave it above average-rating, but I'd like to think myself as better than a mind that gets so easily entertained. \r\nOne can dream...\r\nAnd entertained I was! Shokugeki no Souma was - at the very least - entertaining! There's food, and there's boobies - all the goodnes in the world combined! \r\nNo, but honestly... I reallydid like core consept of this anime - food, chef vs chef, and the brainwork, talent and effort behing every single spoonful! Unfortunately... the core of the show, was just as bare, as were those who ate the said food - lucky bastards!\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the SnS ended, before it even started! The consept, the basic idea, was introduced to us in the very early on - as it should be - and there was even some kind of conflict happening in there... somewhere, before it kinda lost itself into... itself.\\n\\n\r\nA young boy, only son of a legendary chef and a talented one himself, gets - forced by his absent father, through neglection - to attend this best-of-the-absolute-best cooking school, where only the selected view gets to even spend the first night, before permanent life-long elimination, and only a handful will graduate in the end! Powered by the desire to finaly succeed his father, both in talent, passion and in skill, the boy-what's-his-face, finds himself as an immediate underdog, and an irritatingly talented blockhead, who angers some blond bitch for some reason, angers the entire school against him for no reason, and... spoiler-ish?! But wait! The Sequel!!\\n\\n\r\nYeah, so... the story isn't obviously finished yet, due to the second season and all, but... is it still worth the rating it gets?\\n\\n\r\nNo. Not by a mile stone!\\n\\n\r\nIt was pretty obvious to see very early on, to whom this show was originally aimed for, and that the story itself didn't spend even nearly so much time on a writing desk, than the cells of the bouncing boobies, buttocks and steaming bowls of deliciousness. For young boys, this show is ideal, since the plot is actually bigger, than the actual story - fight with food - and not much brainpower is needed to understand, what is happening, and how much jelly those ladies have in their massive, underaged bosoms!\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, the story of a SnS isn't really a \"story\" per say, rather than a core-consept, that just keeps moving forward - not up, or down... just forward. No matter how many efforts this show takes trying to put something satisfactory on the table, the overall tone of the show is really monotonic, full of repeated gimics, traits and gags, and if I would be reviewing this anime, based entirely upon just the story alone, I would waste no time to rip this sucker a new one! The story was there, in the beginning... all the nescessary ingredients were there, ready to be used, but, in the end, there were just too many, or not at all... and none of them used properly, in the end!\\n\\n\r\nIt was like a mediocre-buffet- table, with no order, nor clear picture of what it was actually trying to be, to appeal the hungry eye. Is it fancy? Is it tacky? Is it comfort? Is it even worth the risk? Who knows - it's a mystery-buffet!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters' motivations... the consept, the idea of a plot... characters developing by actions and enviroments... backstories, defeats and triumphs... Those are all ingredients that the SnS uses, more or less. Those should make a average to decent story on their own, but... something is still missing. \\n\\n\r\nWhere's the conflict? Where's the goal? Where's the direction?\\n\\n\r\nIt all feels... rather empty, by heart. In the end, story of the show is just what the name suggests. Food Wars - battles with food... and nothing more! Maybe nothing more is needed, but still... I was left feeling of wanting more.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\\n\r\nBoobs do not jiggle like that!\\n\r\nGood food does not melt off the clothes!\\n\r\nIs it really nescessary to be able to see that... that pubic bone-bump, that you can see, peeking between the legs, when girls are wearing pants?\\n\r\nWhat drugs are these people on?!\\n\\n\r\nSo... those are just some of my favourite pet peeves, while watching the show. The colors are vibrant and powerful, and the art alone really does illustrate the taste of the foods relatively well. Too bad for some, that there will be some naked skin, occasionally... In every episode... Expecially lady-skin... And some tentacles...\\n\\n\r\nYes, the art is lewd. And I loved it! Deal with it!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\\n\r\nI can swear I heard some of my favourite hentai-VA's in there, somewhere...!\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd here is where the bad taste starts for me.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters were mediocre, at best, and unbearably implausible, at worst! I can get behind a fifteen-year-old boy, who knows atleast something about high-class cooking, given his roots and his upbringing, but give me this tsundere-blond-bitch... naturally born girl with a \"God Tongue\", or a boy with a super nose, and I will literally scream you out of this planet! \\n\\n\r\nMaybe I shouldn't be so harsh against gimicks that'll keep the show even mildly entertaining and/or interesting - because the \"story\" sure as Hell doesn't do it for me! - but sorry-not-sorry, I am! \\n\\n\r\nThese people aren't really people, more than they are just some hilariously implausible tropes or gimicks, and that's almost the very same problem that plagued the \"story\", almost from the very beginning! Yes, all the characters are unique, but almost none of them really stand out for me! They're really just a over-grown, grey, lumpy mess, with little actual individualism! I literally cannot name, nor remember any of the characters on their own, based upon their personalities, traits or motivations... just some jiggly boobs, and the \"things\" they did! That's it! It's all just... this weird blur of actions, but very little or no characters attached to them! Maybe, this is just my own problem, but, to me, it's a hellawa big one! \\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't deep, nor complex - just \"good\" enough... collections of some comon anime-traits, some \"new\" gimicks and some \"bouncy bouncy\" nudity. None of them are nothing that I haven't already seen on some other shows, and only a selected view of them we get to see actually developing, while the... \"story\" progresses. Any development, that does happen, is still... relatively plausible and passable in my books, if not so masterly executed, but... given that the whole idea of the show was just to entertain us with some awesomely implausible food battles, the characterization and the charater development are doomed to be left in the shadows - in a role of the spices, not the main course.\\n\\n\r\nPrehaps, I will be proven wrong on the next season... Who knows...\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the major, major flaws this show has, I still really liked it. I liked the vibrant and powerful visuals, and the battles were entertaining, as to be expected. Even though everything else was rotten, the core - although still very bare-boned and simple - was that strong-enough hook, that kept me with the show from the beginning, to the bitter end, with no intention to ever drop it, or put it on the hold, for some other titles. That alone should be a accomplishment!\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the entertainment-value is higly a subjective matter. I have nothing against nudity, so if you're a prude of any kind, you should already be well aware that you won't nescessarily find any worth watching from SnS! There are no great plotlines, no big conflicts, and very little actual heart-to-heart- moments for the romantics - harem-fans, be damned! Only some over the top, OP wanna-be-chefs, making food and measuring each others dinguses, and very little anything more. If the subject of the food wouldn't be so intriguing to me, I would've ended up passionately hating this anime for ever existing, so... the Enjoyment-rating was in the end just a lucky fluke for me.\\n\\n\r\nFood Wars! is stupid... it's shallow, and it's riddiculously over-the-top, but that's also it's appeal - mindless fun, strong visuals, and some imaginative cooking. Expect absolutely nothing more, and you'll leave satisfyed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\\n\r\nNothing great, but fine, if you're not looking much in the first place. The art was nice to look at - colorful, vivid, and lewd - and the enjoyment-value is subjectively speaking uncanny, so... give it a shot, and see yourself, what you think of it.\\n\\n\r\nThere's always the season two, and even that seems to - so far- hold some relatively impressive rankings, so... better luck on next time, eh?",

            "content": "May contain spoilers.\r\nCooking has never been enjoyable than ever before!\r\nShokugeki no Souma is an anime in which the main protagonist daringly shows his skills to the maximum test. Beforehand, as the main protagonist was cooking in his father's shop, he cooks with indescribable passion, and puts his will to the utmost top... Well, he always lose to his father. Even though he tried so hard, he just can't beat him. Now, this is the one that starts it all as his father travels unexpectedly without the notice of his son! Oh Golly, where could he have been? The main character, whose name is Souma, questionswhere his father went. After many failed attempts of finding where is the father's whereabouts, he was called by his father, and he said that Souma will go to the most elite cooking school in Japan!\\n\\n\r\nAs we continue, The story goes on like wildfire as the plot progresses. There were times in which he wins, and there were times he loses. The story was incredibly unpredictable from start to finish due to the fact that we, the audience, are looking in a genuine looking live competition. We are cheering for our competitors, and looking forward on who is going to be victorious. This idea makes the anime definitely enjoyable from the start and to the finish. Also, the fact that the author knows a lot about professional cooking shocked me. I personally thought that this anime  was much simplier than what I thought would be. This second idea makes the anime a whole lot more unique. The only problem in the progression of the plot is yet again, the unnecessary fan service. I know this idea makes some people get more excited to the plot, but in my opinion, does not work. It is distracting and ruins some of the amazing moments in this anime. It makes me cringe somehow. \\n\\n\r\nThe most surprising detail about the artwork is the gorgeous looking food! When I saw it for the first time, I was like \"Woah...\". It looks so delicious even though I know that the food is in the other side of my computer screen. In my opinion, this beats any artwork in the anime. The background and character artwork looks generically normal and are used in any other anime though. Concerning sound, it works really well with the dramatic situations like Souma is in a pinch during his cooking.\\n\\n\r\nWell, this is the slight problem about this anime. The usage of yet again, generic personalities. I thought the characters would have at least a more complex personality in the anime I might say. They are a little bit too simple to read like Ikumi to Souma for example. It is a mix of your generic tsundere and the dense guy. Although they exist, there are some people who are actually decent like Akira and Shun in my opinion. They are mysterious that they are somewhat unpredictable and impressive. And one last thing, do the most of the characters know how to cook other foods? This is my question when it comes to the people like Ikumi and Akira. Do they know only how to handle meat and herbs? Anyways, this \"specialist\" trait sounds really stupid in my opinion. The authors might try to be unique, but this does not work due to the fact that they put a single way of cooking and another in each of the majority of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the characters are quite bad, but the unique concept of food wars makes up for it. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime to the end. Every click of the \"Next\" button was really worth it... Also, I love the overall action between each of the competitors. They don't use swords, guns, or whatsoever, but amazing cooking!\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime to you if you want something that will keep you excited and energized as each episode progresses. :D",

A boy named Souma attends a school called Totsuki academy only 10% of its students graduate. Souma aims to be the top in order to gain his father's approval and take the top spot of the Elite Ten.\r\nThe goal of the story is generic but the major twist is that the anime is ENTIRELY about cooking and no one would expect a story like such. \r\nThe anime features many cooking battles with everyone being an expert in culinary but only a handfulthat are considered good... I particularly enjoy the main highlights of the show which is the exaggeration of the food tastes and the wide range of cuisines featured.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime features a wide range of delectable assortments of mouth-watering cuisines which can literally make you hungry from watching. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is pretty decent and it clearly separates the main and supporting characters from the background characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe exaggerated display of the gourmands and food judges tasting the food and getting their clothes blown away is amusing!\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEach main and side character is sufficiently developed allowing us to understand where their talents lie in and for the main characters, we are allowed to gain a deeper insight in their past and understand what made them who they are.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEvery moan... Every sizzle... Every sound of chewing echoes within our hearts as we wish we can cook like that... Not to mention the erotic voice acting!!!

            "content": "(DISCLAIMER: I won't really go into any spoilers with this review, but I will be covering my thoughts on Food Wars through season 3, so it's not limited to season 1)\r\nFood Wars is causing me to suffer through my worst bout of post-anime depression in a long time. It has been so long since I binged a series so hard. The last thing that comes to mind that I binged as hard was Oregairu last summer, and even Oregairu didn't smack me with as much depression once I finished it. The simple fact was that I enjoyed watching Food Wars that much. It was somethingmagical to me even with its absurd premises and foodgasms. No, I don't think it's perfect, but did I enjoy it enough to give it a spot among my favorites? Yes. Yes, I did.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically speaking, Food Wars is no marvel in the world of anime. It's animation is solid, nothing spectacular; it's sound is pretty good, not like it needed to blow you away anyway. But musically speaking, Food Wars is great. The Openings and Endings do leave something to be desired beyond the season one's first cour, but they're passable. That being said, the true strength of Food Wars lies in its soundtrack. All the songs involving the battles are perfectly atmospheric, be it the intense cooking songs, or the satisfying victory theme. The character tracks deserve a special mention for their quality as well. They capture the specific character almost flawlessly, the regal theme for Erina being my personal favorite, but Hayama's Indian inspired theme and Ryo's rock theme are great examples too. The soundtrack really drives Food Wars above the rest in terms of hype levels. There are moments that have the potential to fall flat, but are instead elevated to epic levels because of the soundtrack alone. On top of those things alone, the voice acting in Food Wars is superb. Soma's voice actor without question deserves a mountain of praise for how dynamic he is with showcasing Soma's emotions. Not only that, but apparently Erina had a voice actor change in season 3 and I never even noticed, major props for that.\\n\\n\r\nBut why do I love Food Wars? It's really simple honestly, it's the characters. It's rare for an anime to make me love nearly every character. Personally, I think the best example of another show doing the same thing is Monogatari. But where Monogatari did it with its arcs dedicated to a certain character, Food Wars does it in a more ensemble way, leading to more shallow side characters, but extremely likable main characters. It helps that most of the main cast is fairly one dimensional, but it's a shounen, there's not a lot of extremely deep characters in shounen in the first place. Even if what I have just described sounds somewhat run-of-the-mill for a show, trust me when I say that it all comes together and works wonders. Who knows, maybe it just appeals to my love of ensemble casts with ecchi harem inspirations, but it just works for me. Maybe it doesn't with others, but to me, this is a perfect cast.\\n\\n\r\n(I really felt like adding this section to my reviews, since characters are such an important factor in anime for me. I'm going to start putting this section in to my reviews from here on out to add a more personal touch!)\\n\r\nFavorite Character: Erina Nakiri\\n\\n\r\nBig surprise, I love the blonde tsundere. Honestly though, I was a hair away from putting Soma here instead. But in the end, I remembered how much I looked forward to Erina's scenes that I realized, even if Soma is my main man, he wasn't the character I loved the most. Soma was the one I cheered for throughout the entire series, experiencing his ups and downs with him and really growing to appreciate his character, despite his tropey clueless nature. But Erina was the character I instantly loved the moment she appeared on screen. I'm a huge sucker for the Soma x Erina ship, I kinda just want season 4 for more of their interactions if I'm being completely honest with myself. Speaking of ships since it's such a huge part of my anime experience, I really liked how Food Wars dealt with such topics, basically confirming that Soma and Erina were a thing in episode 2 ( or was it 1, I can't remember). I just really appreciated letting everyone know that this was the canon ship, keeping us away from the dark waters that could have been Megumi x Soma. Tangent aside, I also considered Alice and Ryo for this, but I figured that even though I really liked both of them, they couldn't hold a candle to Soma or Erina in my book.\\n\\n\r\nWith all the praise I've sung about Food Wars, I have to pause a bit and say that this is all personal preference. The ridiculousness of the food battles isn't for everyone. It could get old fast for those who think that it's over the top. All I would say to those people is, if the first episode doesn't appeal to you, you may as well stop, because you're going to get a lot of the same general thing from there on out. But I hope that my enthusiasm for Food Wars has shown and can maybe inspire you to watch it, because in my opinion, it's worth it.",

People just watch one episode and says its bad but i think you should watch it ever with all these reviews and take ur opinion and watch it urself and this is my opinion so dont come after if its bad. You made the decision urself. It has cooking and comedy and real life scenarios. Ithink overall it is a great anime and u should watch it",

            "content": "Alright, back with another review, this time of Food Wars (*well no shit because this is a Food Wars review page...)\r\nNikumi: *It's not like I want you to read this review anyways...idiot*\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nFirst of all, it's an original story in my opinion. How often do you see a cooking anime? \"Barely\" is the answer (at least in my head). It may be slightly implausible because of characters' ages (high school), but that little imperfection is going to be put on the back burner for now (HA I'M FUNNY). Let's start with a summary: kid helps his superstar dad in a small diner in ashopping district. Dad runs off to appease his global clients, and sends his aspiring kid to an elite cooking school, where he impresses everyone, especially a himedere. He stays in the dorm for interesting people (Isshiki is the best) and competes for the top seat in the school's student council. To be totally honest, the topic of cooking is quite bland (ANOTHER ONE) and can get very repetitive sometimes. But the intense competitions and challenges that Soma/Souma faces along with the target of my personal intense shipping Megumi keeps the audience on the edge of their seat. Of course, the comedy is the star of the show, but like food, there is depth as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nIf anyone starts off by saying \"no offence\" everyone automatically knows that they're going to insult something. Well, no offence, but the art is not out of the ordinary in SnS. It's solid - let's just say that. Smooth animation, effects (like aromas and textures) enhance the food, but there are few places where it's a bit of a distraction from the *ahem* fanservice. Actually, on the topic of fanservice, I can say one thing that automatically brings down the art rating. Tentacles.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nI really liked the first opening and ending songs. They are catchy and stick even through the second half. I really wish they hadn't changed the songs. I mean, come on, the second ending song was so weird that I had to skip it. I remember hearing the first opening over and over again on Crunchyroll ads that I couldn't skip because money. But the ending song, Spice, is so good, I think I'm going to download it soon. The drumming is incredible, and it's just all in all an amazing song. The sound effects actually help too, unlike the visual effects, because they emphasize the comedic aspects of devouring a dish. My favourite scene of the whole show is Episode 9, where Soma is walking to the public baths and bumps into Erina. It's not the coincidental extra fanservice that strikes my fancy, but it's how Matsuoka (Soma's voice actor) hums the ascending scale. It's so horribly off key that it makes me laugh my ass off every time. I have perfect pitch, so that makes it even worse. Even if the openings and endings were shit, I would still rate the sound of SnS 10/10 just because of that scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\r\nSoma reminds me of Hinata from Haikyuu. Both are super goal-oriented and have their own set of skills that set them apart. Soma can easily adapt and is an all around genius, who's ignorant about his own arrogance, but that's what makes him a fun character. Megumi is just so sweet in her own way, starting off as clumsy but growing into a confident chef who serves homey and emotional food. She's the one that is often overlooked by characters in the anime, but everyone watching the show has their attention on her. Nakiri Erina is one of the most annoying princess-archetypes I have ever had the misfortune of experiencing. I really want to punch that himedere in the face (maybe it's a personal thing; I just hate himederes in general). However, that does make for a good character. After all, there is a saying: \"good people don't make good characters\". Erina is a good character in the sense that she is a necessary evil, if you catch my drift. In the food world, she's like those carved carrot flowers at Chinese restaurants that everyone knows has been reused for like 8 other plates before yours. You're supposed to eat it (because everything on the plate should be edible), in this case you're supposed to like Erina, but you don't because you know better. Those are the main characters, but the supports that are worth mentioning include the always-present tsundere (Nikumi), Erina's cousin Alice, Alice's bipolar lackey Ryou, and my personal favourite, Seat 7 and the naked-apron chef Isshiki. To be honest, there is not too much in the development area for Soma because he is so goal oriented - he learns from losing but that fact doesn't change - on the other hand, Megumi evolves in a positive way, and Nikumi changes like the typical tsundere - from coldhearted to shy and abusive - but these all contribute to a very satisfying character squad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nCooking is not exactly my forte, nor is it a topic that I am passionate about. I mean, I like to eat but it's not like I want to make good-tasting food for other people. It's mine, you hear? I have a little brother around 10 years old, and he's just starting to pick up recipes and make stuff, but there is no way in hell I'm letting him watch this show. Anyways, this show checks a lot of the boxes in my must-haves in a comedy anime. For example, it must have (a) either a really smart or really clueless main character, (b) nice visuals, (c) must be relatable (aka slice of life) or on the extreme side (aka Gintama), (d) cute girls (hehe), and (e) the more chibi the better. An optional checkbox is a hint of ecchi, though it really depends on my mood. Too much, like DxD or Highschool of the Dead, is just really cringy. But this one is pretty much ideal in the sense that it has a perfect balance between action, comedy, and fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't started the second season because I haven't had a lot of free time recently, but that's near the top of my to-watch queue right now. Soon, though. SnS really made its mark due to its soundtrack and comedy I think. Another successful anime from Mainichi, well done.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who've watched the show and enjoyed my review, I'm\\n\r\nglad you enjoyed it! \\n\\n\r\nHeh another reference. I like to think I'm funny, if you haven't figured yet.",

It's definitely not something watch with your parents unless your parents understand how weird anime can be. \r\nThis first season packed a lot of punch, in my opinion. Not only was it 24 episodes long and therefore able to present a lot of plot, it also introduced the characters and their strengths and differences perfectly. The first episode had me hooked right away, and by the end of the season, I was completely in love with these characters and their journey at Totsuki.\r\nI'd say that some of the best parts of this anime would be thesupporting characters. Soma, Megumi, and Erina are all amazing, but it's the additional set of characters that really makes this anime shine. Beyond that, the overall story for this anime is sort of heartwarming. It's also cloaked in mystery, and it makes you want to learn more and more about this school and the people that are a part of it. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those anime where the art and sound rank lower than everything else, so it isn't gonna smack you in the face with amazing sensory detail, but the people and the drama will stick with you.

            "content": "If wasnt for battle shounen, i would never seen an Anime in my entire life. So, I am a big fan of the genre. What I couldn't expect is that a culinary battle shounen would become one of my all time favorites. \r\nYou expect the most clich\u00e9e shounen from Shokugeki no Souma. The mais character that always win at the end, the danzels in distress, the rival, the ridicoulous villain, the school factions... but it subverts its on clich\u00e9es in a very exciting and sophisticated culinary battle royale with tons of information and culture. The clash between great chefs is over the top and pureadrenaline, but its differencial is the info that came with it, the info about the most exquisite dishes you can imagine. And also, tons of creative culinary sexy fantasies and flashbacks, give you delicious comedic moments and heartwarming moments, respectively. \\n\\n\r\nBut the characters are the great soul of this show. Every one of them Kicks ass and have great personalities, and can make brilliant dishes (as you can see in the Autunm Election Arc). Even the antagonists aren't despicable, all of them are products of their experience and vision of the world. Every single character has their moment to shine and gain the public's affection and respect. All of them have also an unique and great character design, specially the feminine characters, that are simply hot. \\n\\n\r\n Souma, the protagonist, is all what an shounen protagonist needs to be: fearless, smug, charismatic... but is also something more: is dedicated, passionate to cooking and very smart. He is always seen studying or crafting new dishes, he wins his adversaries by doing best plates after hours of research and errors. Also, he learns with his defeats and fails, becoming even greater after every challenge he faces. Megumi is not also the tipycal Shounen Girl, she has a strong personality, and, despite being so klutz, is very skilled on cooking, developing a style rooted on her traditions and family, and also becoming more confident along the way. Is, by far, the best character of the show, and the one that gave us the most hearthwarming moments of the show. Hayama, the master of scents, and his heartbreaking past; Erina, the altive tongue of god and Souma's nemesis, The Aldini Brothers and the classical tropes of rivalrie... and other secundary characters as Alice, Ryo and the students of Kyokusei dorm, they are all intriging and charismatic. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is extremelly beautifull, the use of colours and the vivacity of drawnings turn Shokugeki in sensorial experiencie. It sharpens the taste, makes the scents vivid; makes your body shiver with the characters' reactions and is poetry to the eyes. That all is wrapped in a great soundtrack, that sets the tone of the battles and comedic moments; and great sound efects to related to the food. Also, is good to remark the great and exciting opening and ending songs. \\n\\n\r\nSo, Shokugeki is a great sensorial ride to the world of culinary battles, despite being a little bit repetitive. Is exciting, funny, and epic on its own way, with an unique crew of characters; and awekens the inner desire to become a great chef or learn how to cook in some cases. Is a delicious and creative dish to the imagination of the viewer, and is also culture, a pearl in the middle of unexciting battle shounens and, finally, a great work of art from JC Staff and an anime to be apprecited, withouth self-restraint, by anime fans of all times and ages.",

The characters are all amazing iven the ones meant to be bad and rivals. \r\nThe main character, Souma, (yes i'm going to be a bit biased here) Is amazing. even though His skills are elite level, he doesn't brag or show off and isnt a snob. The characters are super awesome, and have the stupid silly quirky side to them. Theres a lot to learn and many tips for cooking. Even if you dont like cooking or the levelof food porn, theres mor in the story and the characters and I SO RECOMMEND THIS SO MUCH!!!!!! The manga is also very good if you want to read it :)",

            "content": "Frankly speaking, i'm a culinary student and a big fan of the Master Chef and Gordon Ramsay's TV series. And if you notice, \"Kojiro Shinomiya\" the guy that's specialize in the field of vegetable, legume etc cooking and aesthetic cooking, has the almost exactly the same attitude as Joe Bastianich (The bald, angry looking guy with a pretty derisive tone towards every competitor on Masterchef) in the show. And if you gonna complain about how this anime took cooking little bit too seriously. Then go and watch Masterchef, or attend within one of the most proficient, highly rank culinary school, or working within of thestrictest restaurant in town then you will understand why many head chef are so obsess with perfection, and are intolerated with behaviors that messes up their view of a certain dish that they like, or glorify. Tbh, I'm not surprise by the overly serious connotation that Shokugeki no soma just gave to its context of cooking in the animation or the cooking world, but is it alittle bit too over dramatic, and solemn? Like Really really serious, or too serious, to the point where it's too cruel and extreme? Well yes that is something that i have to agree with. And the fact that someone who's a head chef of their restaurant brought a not fresh, and extremely oxidized ingredients kinda contradicts the quality of being a good chef in the general sense. But aside from such an inhumane and lack of chef's emotions to sympathize with other young, striving chef. I can say that it's one of the thing that's too overly exaggerated within this anime. The intensity during the way they cook at such high speed, faster than a fucking speed of sound and some shit are pretty unnecessary for some of the parts of the show. And how food can manipulate a person to change one's mind. Which is illogical, but the intensity of how good the food is, and how they are so desperate to eat them are just, idk, just make it understandable as to why they decided to do so. While Some may like it, and some may not. However, i personally like these kind of intensity, and it's something that would definitely motivate a person to cook, or \"try to cook\" (lol) in a kitchen as well.  Because it's so epic, beautiful, looking very aromatic with alot of fragrance indication just by seeing the aesthetics of the animated/pictured food in the show etc. And it's the main key that make Shokugeki no soma so successful in the manga industry and the animated version of it as well. Plus the OST makes it even more epic sounding. Just like the overly dramatic OST in the Master Chef. I mean just check one of the episode, during the elimination. You will know what i mean. It will only takes like 30 second to spot it. And btw, it's a fucking anime. How to make things that are seemingly normal look interesting and attractive to the viewer? Make a huge exaggeration, or putting in a chef's or a person's dream of wanting to do a specific things while cooking, or something to occur in term of the relationships between the weak and strong, talented and admired etc, to make a story, \"an interesting story\". There's alot of theme in this anime, one is obviously the \"weak vs strong\", \"mistake makes better\" or some other shit like that, which actually makes this a great story to watch that has some meaning to different relationships between the character in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAND GUESS WHAT, this artist is the exact same artist as the one who animated a hentai called, \"harem time animation\" (that's by far one of his most famous work in the hentai+hentai manga industry) and his pen name or pseudonym is, \"tosh\" if you wanna look him up and.... ummmm, you know what i mean right? Check him out for some research purposes ;) And that's why most of the scene contain alot of ecchi, hentai orgasmic voice acting, and alot of sexual implication with their wording like juices, meat, etc. Plus You can see food orgasm every single period of time. In addition to that, they also did alot of symbolism with their cookery and ways to keep people attentive to their culinary advice, summary of history (that's culinary related) and the analysis that they makes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the one thing that i gotta point out about this anime... Is the fact that there's too much explanation onto the chemistry of the food, the chemical reaction between acids, or the amino acids, the preparation that the author did, and decided to replicate her dish that she made in real life (yes this is a real life recipe made by an actual chef), other variation of the origin and stuff like that strays away from the actual cooking or how it harmonize in some of the dishes with a proper explanation but not just a vague ones, and with some intentional divergent from expressing the  decency of the texture or the taste of the food. Or how they forgot to add the concept of caramelization of certain ingredient in a dish as it cooks, the lacks of showing a proper kitchenware, showing how the character set their cooking temperature while cooking, or how long does it takes to cook them and so forth in the show. And the food in itself aren't really at that really where you would go, \"HMMMMM THAT'S GOOD!\". It's just decent and good when you cook it in real life. But this is by far, one of the most insightful cooking anime that i've seen that covers many different respective cultural dishes, herbs, cooking methodology using various culture style (one would be the poele method), ways of seasoning, the blending of spices and condiment and all things other things.  And dont forgot about how some part of the animated cooking knife technique in the show and other thing else. It wasn't a really an accurate representation of how you would normally use these knifes with a specific way of handling the given ingredient before cutting them. Why is that? look at the way some of the character handle the knives and tell me that it's similar to how an actual chef in real life actually does. However, these kind of technique still works, but it's not a safety way to do it in the culinary community (in the western part of the world at the very least). And the other thing that i wanted to mention is the way how they preserved their stocks, food, freshness in them and etc. In Soma's restaurant and some that you may be able to spot on this highly epic culinary school that surpass our imagination that it can actually be this epic. \\n\\n\r\nThe character wise, i fucking love them. They're pretty like-able in many different perspective. It's like that \"Gangsta\" the anime if you could recall it, where the characters are all badasses with a certain uniqueness to their character that makes them even more noticeable, and less plain to see. But with this anime, despite the iconic, archetypal characters in the story (like we sees in almost every anime/movies/hollywood movies etc.). They're unique, welly drawn and when i say welly drawn i mean, they are very sexy, with two huge balloon or oppai, em thigh, and cute or KAWAII~! character and moe orgasmic responses to eating a certain dishes that was made by Soma and others. I fucking expect no less from a perverted artisit ;) and btw, i have a picture of the actual chef consultant that Shokugeki no soma consulted with for a certain dishes that they decided to put into the anime (https://www.google.com/search?q=yuki+morisaki&espv=2&biw=1366&bih=643&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjy0diG_-_MAhUJppQKHa2LAUkQ_AUIBigB). \\n\\n\r\nHow you like her ;) \\n\\n\r\nShe's so cute, sexy and beautiful and oh maw god. So much nudity (but some cloth are still intact) in those pictures, on google search by just her name. And btw check this one out too (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaJYqoue44I)\\n\\n\r\nAnd the dialogue has that freshness or tone that i've never seen in an anime before. It's unique, and idk how to explain that. The way it was set, talks, organize during some of the drama within this show is just brilliant and i love it. And the voice actors really did one hella job to stay in character through out the entire series with no flaw or mistakes at all. They definitely made the character look quite alive on the animated version of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes you don't have to click those perverted links that i am giving you about how beautiful, cute and sexy the chef consultant of this cooking anime is.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for the digression, it was intentional yet satisfying for me. But as to how my overall rating of this review is going to be.  I would give it a 7 at its maximum. Tbh, the humor is alittle bit too silly, childish and out of context of the intensity or the seriousness in the show. And yes i know, this is an anime and it's more fun to see humorous and weird character in the show, that has the kind of personality that's unique and welly known in the anime community personality/character archetypes. But the humor kinda throw me off alittle bit, and some of the food orgasm scene as well. But, i have no intense reaction towards those food orgasm scene since im use to seeing many of the weirdest shit that the japanese anime/people have brought to us, in our world that is uniforming into globalization. So im essentially immune to it. In this context, It's a cooking anime, ofc we gonna see some pretty slow character development because nothing that's worth noting has occur in the show just yet that would result in character/personality changes, when all of the character aren't introduces yet. However i can see alot of character development from episode 3-7 or so if you've pay attention to how their personality has changed, and  there're alot of character development in the show. Some example are \"Soma\" (THE MC), Megumi (incompetent, hardworking blue hair girl, who got more confident later in the story), Kojiro Shinomiya and so forth. This was a really fun ride, and the character emotions, voice acting, OST, drama, dialogue, etc. are fucking spot on with this show. Definitely worth a watch, but it will creep you out xD . However, because it's an anime, and because it's an art. It will be less creepy than you would have thought.",

            "content": "Every so often I find myself watching an anime that for whatever reason I can't leave alone. These addictive shows often, if broken down and analyzed, wouldn't compare to some of the dramatic heavyweights that we all praise. \r\nSo why is it that a show like Shokugeki no Souma can become so popular and well received? I think that answer lies in the hearts and minds of the viewers. Anime, at it's core, is still a cartoon. It can take many forms. Some can be outrageous with food-driven orgasms, and others will make you cry. I do find myself in the mood at times towatch something thought provoking. But mostly, I tend to watch shows that don't require me to think a whole lot while viewing. Shokugeki is perfect for that.\\n\\n\r\nIf your having doubts about giving it a shot just know what your getting into. Nothing about this show will blow your mind. Often times it feels repetitive ( especially the fan service ), and the cook-offs do tend to drag a little bit. There is also a lack of character development, however a majority of them are likable and have independent personalities.\\n\\n\r\nBased on what sort of shows you like and knowing your personal taste, I think that if you're still reading this far you should be able to decide if this show is for you. Shokugeki no Souma is fun. If your looking to be impressed, look elsewhere.",

            "content": "Being a big fan of cooking though I myself haven't been able to cook anything edible so far, having watched Shokugeki no Soma awakened an urge within me to pursue the path of a chef and while the previous statement was obviously a joke, it was not entirely unfeasible given I just have to work hard and give all my best which was what this show instilled upon my maiden heart and truly, it was a lesson that I take into heart. \r\nShokugeki no Soma is a cooking show. The guy cooks and once finished, gives it to the judges. Then, the judge goes alldetailed and stuff about the food, the ingredients and techniques used to produce such dish accompanied with an often exaggerated reaction and if the judge is a woman(which was always the case), you get an awesome fanservice with all the \"boing boing\" and lecherous voice that you'll have to turn the volume down. Except with the fanservice though, this all had to be somehow familiar to you. Indeed, it was very much similar to Yakitate Japan(another great show) in that regard. And while it borrowed some ideas from the previous show stated, it had its own quirks which make for a show that offers something new and refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the show was, I must say, well done. In terms of soundtracks implemented and the progression of the story, they were all blended so well that a supposed-to-be moving scene was certainly, well, quite moving. The ending theme was also a heartwarming piece of music with how mellow and vibrant it was and at the same time, a gentle tinge of something undefinable was mixed within which made for a nice relaxing feel at the end of each episode. And one musn't forget that this is a cooking show. So what do you expect? They cook, cook and cook. Infinite cooking. And a show of this type can get pretty repetitive very early in the game. Fortunately, the imminent problem was circumvented by cutting the cooking segments into just enough screentime and giving some time to develop some of the casts. And in some cases where the cooking parts eat up an entire episode, what was presented was actually entertaining enough that it justifies the massive amount of time sacrificed into those. \\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the show, on the other hand, wasn't so organized compared to the first half. The just right pacing its first half did very well was brought into a staggering amount of endless cooking trivias and mind-buggering jargons and stuff that amounted to nothing but boredom. While the handling of character development went stronger than before, the majority of time spent dilly-dallying around of the judges before rating the food made the show repetitive as heck. The \"shonen\" genre has become much more apparent in this second half which could be a good or a bad thing, depends which side of the coin you are. The second opening theme was equally atrocious. It was just too rowdy that the relaxed feel the show had from the beginning was destroyed before your very eyes. It screams \"THIS IS SHONEN,***!\" and it was honestly infuriating rather than hype-inducing. The second ending theme though appealed to me a lot since I'm a fan of Yakushimaru Etsuko's weird singing(it's truly weird, yet charming in its own right).\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Soma's latter half dampered the mood the show made in the beginning and while it was a disappointment, it was still pretty entertaining until the end. The show was very educational and I learned a lot. It was also a lot more hilarious than I expected. Most of the characters were given just enough development that made you care for them and Tadakoro Megumi is a character that I've grown to like a lot in the course of the show's entire run. Its fanservice which some might abhor shouldn't deter you from watching the show though as that reason for refusing to view it would just be too silly. And last reminder before watching, the show could empty your wallet a lot faster than you would expect.",

Whatever you want to say about the poor character development (there is practically none whatsoever), the predictable storyline (Souma has more plot armor than Kirito), and all the usual tropes thatare so painful recognizable that you're like, not again!, this show does a good job of what it's supposed to do \u2013 entertain people. \\n\\n\r\nSo Souma is the most stereotypical shounen that ever shounened, most of the girls end up falling for him because he gives them foodgasms, and somehow, this all works very well together. Don't try to squeeze more out of this anime than it can give - this is just pure mindless entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I enjoyed a lot about it was the music \u2013\u00a0a tad overdramatic at times, it combined very well with the visuals and the mood, and the art was vibrant and very well incorporated.

            "content": "The strong points of this anime are it's art/animation and overall enjoyment. If you are looking for a short yet immersive, exciting, unique anime, this is the one for you.\r\nPlot: The plot is very unique. It revolves around tastes of food, cuisines, cooking, etc. It draws in your attention quite early on. It has a perfect balance between seriousness and comedy. Howeverr, it does get kind of repetitive at times. Through the course of this Anime, we follow highschool student Yukihira Soma who joins an elite culinary school. He challenges and works through several competitions and tests through his journey to the top. The plotalso involves various cultures from around the world. We get quite detailed info. on French, Italian, Japanese, Indian, Chinese, etc. cuisines and are introduced to various ingredients we've never heard of. The reactions to the food are heavily exaggerated in a good way. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art and animation are absolutely stunning. The dishes look delicious and every time a new dish is shown, I ended up drooling. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack has a wide variety. It fits in perfectly with the scene and dish being presented at the moment. Japanese dishes have a Japanese soundtrack, Indian dishes have an Indian soundtrack, etc. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: There are several important characters and most have them have very interesting and unique personalities. The protagonist himself is very entertaining, confident, and immersive. However, certain characters weren't to my liking. Such as Megumi, the lead female character. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I was never bored while watching this anime and the comedy keeps you entertained for very long. The also input some facts regarding tastes, spices, flavors and their combinations.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this anime to someone who is looking for something fresh and unique. However, I warn you, the fan service is quite high in this one though it doesn't ruin the experience.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Cooking is one of those hobbies that can be just a plain old hobby or even a full-blown career. Regardless of the style of cooking, a good dish is a joyous thing to experience. Still, one of the most enjoyable things I have ever done is cooking, creating something that will then be enjoyed, even if just by me, is a great feeling. And Food Wars! Shokugeki no Soma is a great portrayal of that joy, albeit in a much more competitive way.\r\nFood Wars! Shokugeki no Soma, or just Shokugeki no Souma, is a 2015 shounen anime that adapts part of the manga of thesame name written by Yuuto Tsukuda, with the collaboration of Yuki Morisaki, a food researcher, and illustrated by Shun Saeki, that is published by Weekly Shonen Jump. The adaptation is produced by J.C Staff (Bakuman, Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?) and directed by Yoshitomo Yonetani (Yuusha-Oh GaoGaiGar, Brigadoon).\\n\\n\r\nThe teenager Soma Yukihira and his father Jouichirou Yukihira share both a restaurant and a rivalry, in which the first trains to surpass the second. The protagonist\u2019s routine consists in going to a regular school in the morning and cooking at the restaurant in the afternoon, all to surpass his father, but everything changes when the parent decides to close the restaurant. Because of this, Yukihira is sent to the top culinary school of Japan, Tootsuki Culinary Academy, to improve his cooking. There, he meets other aspiring chefs, takes part in competitions and tries to survive in a school with 10% graduation rate!\\n\\n\r\nThe Tootsuki Culinary Academy proves to be a great setting to a culinary series as it has some interesting internal mechanics, namely the shokugekis, which are culinary matches in which the chefs can bet anything they want, from club rooms to expulsion. Its introduction raises the tension in unforeseen ways, and from that point one it never stops raising the stakes. Despite being a cooking anime and not having flashy named moves, Food Wars! Shokugeki no Soma is more exciting than many others shounens, as it never slows down and keeps introducing new characters, new competitions and new dishes.\\n\\n\r\nAnother strength of the anime is, apart from the reactions, how credible everything is. Thanks to Yuki Morisaki's work, every dish has a solid scientific and practical background that is shown in the series through the judges' explanations. As I said, the only point that isn't in line with this affirmation are the reactions to the food. At first, that is, the first 6 or so episodes, those reactions are mostly fan-service in nature, but this changes from that point on, as it becomes more and more comedy focused. By the end, these reaction are hilarious, dramatic and quirky.\\n\\n\r\nFood Wars! Shokugeki no Soma frequently uses its story and characters to poke fun at shounen tropes, for example the rival. At one point, a character proclaims himself to be the protagonist's rival and, instead of receiving a likewise dramatic statement, he is ridiculed by his brother, as he is too cheesy. That, of course, doesn't mean that the anime doesn't fall into any other tropes, for example, a former enemy becoming a friend. But the beauty is how that is portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nIn the setting of the anime, everything is based around and resolved through food and cooking. Naturally, character development also happens because of food, but don't let that fool you. Food Wars! Shokugeki no Soma paints a tragical world amidst its awesomeness through these developments, as the characters always have a reason to be themselves and that reason is, most of the times really sad. The character development, despite being centered around food, manages to be better than many other anime, both in terms of depth and enjoyability.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is varied, from the smug and sore-loser protagonist, who actually has a personality, to a regular tsundere love-interest to a student who wears only an apron. Being a cooking anime, each character has their own cooking style that serves to give them even more personality. From the main cast to the supporting characters, everyone is instantly memorable, with most of them being important at least once in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is vibrant and colorful, without being too flashy. While the backgrounds aren't that well detailed, the food is chock-full of it and mouth-watering. The character design is slightly more exaggerated than in the manga, leaving the girl's boobs more prevalent and \"fanservicey\".\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a great accompaniment to every scene, being highly energetic and dramatic during cooking scenes, which make them even more awesome. There is a lot of care put into the voice acting, too. For example, a character that comes from the countryside has the accent of that particular region. As a final note in the sound department, the first ED is absolutely brilliant and is even used in some unusual ways.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of the manga, I am extremely happy with the adaptation that Food Wars! Shokugeki no Soma was given, as it captures everything that is great about the series and made even me, someone highly familiarized with its plot, excited for the nex episode. This is just a small tastement to how enjoyable the show is.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Food Wars! Shokugeki no Soma to fans of shounens, as it is among the best. Also, if you are looking for a hugely enjoyable anime, watch it. It is a 12/10 in that regard.",

            "content": "UPDATED BECAUSE MAL REMOVED MY LAST ONE\r\nSo much plot everywhere. Just...so much.\r\nFor real, though. This is one of my favorite series in a long time, and I have little idea why. The food orgasms are just so ball bustingly funny for some reason that I just giggle like a 12 year old whenever they happen.\r\nThe story is typical...very typical. A boy wants to become more skilled at cooking and has to overcome challenges that are seemingly suicidal. The way it's conveyed, though, is just fantastic. It pokes fun at other shonen tropes constantly. \r\nSome examples: Instead of the main character being forced to leave homefor some contrived reason, it's his father literally just popping up and sending him away all of the sudden. When the rival tries to act like he's in a typical shonen manga, he ends up looking like a fool. It's great.\\n\\n\r\nIt even subverts a common shonen trope at the end of the 24 episode long series. It's extremely rare of any anime to do so and deserves recognition for it. It is sure to become an integral part of the main character's development in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nThe underdog story told by Shokugeki is also a lot more effective, as Soma makes an enemy out of everybody the instant he enters the school. The odds are stacked against him a lot more than in other anime, because he starts off with zero allies.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all insanely likable. Even the alpha bitch, the archetype that I usually hate, is likable because she has a legitimate reason to dislike the MC. He goes against everything her character is, so she tries to reject him but fails over and over again. It's an integral part of her character, and that saves her from just being annoying.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters have a twist, and the ones that don't are saved through their comedic interactions with each other. I don't hate any of the characters in this show, and that's saying something.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is great. The opening is great, the ending stayed in my head far longer than it should have (the chorus is so warm and happy I can't help but love it), and the pump up music during the cooking sequences were awesome too.\\n\\n\r\nArt is clean. Environments can't get too stunning, seeing as how the series takes place mostly indoors, but some of the outdoor shots are stunning. The character designs are fantastic. The boys are all distinct, and the girls all have lots of plot.\\n\\n\r\nThere's plenty of emotion to be found other than hilarity, though. Some of the character backstories will legitimately grab onto tear ducts and squeeze them dry. The most unlikable characters always have sad backstories to explain why they are who they are.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a fun and hilarious series that everyone should check out. Just don't watch it in public.",

            "content": "I can get why some people would find this anime unappealing. We all have our reasons, and it always varies. I, for one, do not like cooking shows. For that reason I nearly dropped Shokugeki just for that reason. But my sister loved it; she kept on harping about it like it was a new craze. So I reluctantly started watching it, not knowing what a roller-coaster it would be.\r\nI'll begin by informing you that this show really takes culinary seriously. It's very informative and educational, along with entertaining. These were huge pluses for me, because I didn't want to be droned with boring monologuesand stupid cooking innuendos that were just there for the sake of being there.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that grabs your attention is Souma, a headstrong aspiring chef who wishes to surpass his father one day and own their little restaurant. Souma is confident, to the point where he initially believes that his cooking has little rivalry.\\n\\n\r\nOne day, his father leaves suddenly, and enrolls Souma in a culinary school. Soma thinks it's a pain; he even complains to his father via phone call. But the guy is blindsided when he's told that the school isn't an ordinary one. It's high class, demands nothing but excellence, and has a pass rate of 10%. THAT'S what drew me in. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime, you really feel how the characters struggle. The school itself is brutal and only the best can make it passed their challenges.\\n\\n\r\nI was really impressed with Souma overall. He fought tooth and nail to survive against top-level candidates that are from rich backgrounds, and have had the best of lives. He faced challenge after challenge with certainty that he could beat them. What made him even more grounded as a character was that even though he put all his effort into something, it didn't mean he would be on top every time. He always strives to be better, even more so when he loses at something. The unpredictability of Souma aided in developing him into a well-rounded, likable individual.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi was another favorite of mine. She started off timid and unsure of her abilities as a chef. She almost got expelled from the school, but she was able to get help and confide in Souma as a partner, and their teamwork won them partial victory when they needed it. Overtime, she grew into her own person and rose to the occasion thanks to being around Souma and her dormmates.\\n\\n\r\n'Nikumi' was one person I felt was the least developed and a bit rushed as a supporting character. It would have been nice to see a better effort in making her.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in the show is perfectly executed. It highlights danger when necessary, adds to the comedy aspect of the anime, and genuinely - sometimes - nice to just sit back and listen to.  \\n\\n\r\nWhether you like cooking or not, whether you feel that watching someone make something to eat in an anime is a waist of your time, you should really give this show a shot. It's not for everyone, that's for damn sure, but the only way for you to decide whether it suits your curiosity is to try it out. \\n",

But it does, and your blood will get pumping every single time. The characters are awesome. The humor is spot on, even translated, which is rare. The sexy-bits are sexy. And if I knew how I would fund this to be ongoing. It's absolutely phenomenal.\r\nStory - The plot, while very battlemanga standard, is perfectly executed. The premise being food removes the immersion breaking \"this character survived super crazy stuff\" that most series have. The premise plays to it's strength to the pointwhere even my 4th time watching the anime and my 8th time in the manga I'm still excited to see the story develop.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art is great. Smooth, creative, and the changes in art between regular time, battle mode, post-foodgasm, and during stress times make the story so much more intense. Everything about it plays a part and nothing is wasted. Gorgeous. \\n\\n\r\nSound - Incredible. The sound of food sizzling, eggs cracking, all of it is spot on. The music that ramps up during high intensity battle segments is immersive as anything ever has been. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - I love the characters. All of them. Even the characters I usually detest (the whiny ones with no self confidence) such as Tadoroko I still love, because they have so much development. There is a MASSIVE cast to this anime, and yet it never feels overwhelming, everyone has their place and plays their part. And Soma/Erina's relationship alone could sell this to most people. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Obviously, I loved this. This is definitely in my top 3 of all time now. I just can't stop loving it. Everyone should watch this. Binge watch it. Right now. Stop reading this. Go watch it. NOW.",

Its basically about a chef prodigy who up works with his father at a local restaurant (Trust me it gets so much better) Its got comedy, character development, and oh my god FOOD! Yes there is a LOT of cooking going on in the show hell if it doesn't make you hungry at the end of a episode you probably don't have a stomach. The creators of the anime have found a wayto make cooking look fun and entertaining. Each episode you'll be thinking \"Oh crap whats he going to cook next?\" and it gets much deeper then that with the character interaction. You will see people bashing this show as a \"Cooking Simulation\" type of thing but its more then that. This show actually got me wanting to learn how to cook, and i don't mean learning how to bake a cake oh no i mean like going to culinary arts school and later going on Hells Kitchen with Chef Ramsey kind of cooking. Oh and the opening is pretty awesome to.",

            "content": "This anime was really cool. One of my first anime I've watched, I thought this anime was one of the best ever. Now... not so much. Although I still stand by my opinion of this anime, good, I think this anime gave up a piece of itself for fanservice. It was a cool idea at first, but it quickly got old for me. As I rewatched it, it wasn't as interesting. \r\nStory 7/10\r\nVery simple story. Very simple concept. I like it. I'm not worried about the paramount ending, as the series WILL have a second season sometime this or next year. There were few flawsin this story, and, although I didn't like it as much as I could've, I still found the story to be well structured and entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime is gorgeous. I loved the character design, the backgrounds, the everything! That's all I'll say.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe songs from this anime are great. Nothing really stood out to me too much, EXCEPT the opening and ending. The first op and the second ending, to be specific. I liked it so much. The other songs within the anime fit the scenes they are placed in quite well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters were bland. They all fell under very general tropes, and there wasn't really any depth to them, not even Souma. They do fit their roles well, though, so I don't mind as much as other people would.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI like this anime. It is funny, serious at the right moments, and mood shifts feel natural. If there was more character development, that would've done this anime a gigantic favor though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime is the pinnacle of food fanservice, if that's a thing. I thought a food anime was a good idea. This anime has a lot of flaws, but it's comedy and simple story makes up for some of that. Not all of it though.\\n\\n",

            "content": "So, Shokugeki no Souma it is. Going into this, I had no expectations except for being hopefully a bit entertained. After all, what can you expect from a simple cooking show? Oh boy, how wrong I was.\r\nThe plot is simple, students at an elite cooking school (the best in Japan iirc) striving to be the best cook. It started slowly and at first, it was nothing more than a simple comedy with a shallow storyline and shallow characters, which turned out to be true and false.\r\nThe storyline is pretty predictable as we have little to no surprises but who watches this, expecting it to besuspenseful? Although, I have to say, it is very \"binge-worthy\" as people nowadays say. I found myself wanting to know and see more with each episode. Even so, it is admittedly very stretched and slow paced at times. \\n\r\nLike I said, yes it is simple but the simplicity doesn't take away from the enjoyment - instead it highlights the other important aspects. Without a deep/complex storyline, it has to completely rely on its characters and comedic moments and it did it very well imo. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the focus and deservedly so. When I started watching the show, I thought these characters were nothing but one dimensional. I was quickly proved wrong when, as the storyline continues, they gain a very surprising amount of depth. By which I do not mean that these characters are exceptionally deep and layered, rather I was just surprised they get any depth. Character development, on the other hand, is...small. There are one or two students who get to see develop a bit, but that's about it.\\n\r\nThe anime handles bringing in more characters very well and as it goes on, we get to know more and more characters. Slowly, but not too slowly. Fast, but not too fast. The variety of the characters is one of the strengths of Shokugeki no Souma. They're all different yet interesting and each one has their own strength. With so many characters though, of course some will have to take a back seat. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now onto the most important and best part of this show: The comedy. What can I say? It was hilarious! Each episode made me laugh outloud a few times, which is pretty hard for a show to do. After all, it is a comedy and it does it so well. This is what the characters are for - the comedy. And it works. Very well. This anime uses a lot, A LOT, of (visualized) metaphors and ecchi, both making everything even funnier than it already is. Although, I do have to say, the ecchi is just too much at times.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, Shokugeki no Souma is a very funny anime with a simple plot and charismatic characters that will make you laugh if you let it.",

            "content": "-Story 10/10\r\nThis is a food show featuring Yukihara Souma, whose father runs a dinner with him helping. His father is regarded as an excellent cook and so is Souma, though the latter isn't able to match up to the former. He is then sent to a cooking school where passing is a miracle, where the top few of the cohort are pretty much guaranteed success if they were to graduate. This show then follows Souma's adventures with his friends in constant cook-offs where they are given tasks to fulfil in order to stay in the school. And I must say that never would I haveimagined a cooking show like this would be able to make me want to watch so much more. With constant cliffhangers, adrenalin pumping cooking action and continuous explanations of how the tantalizing food they cook is made, this show was a wild ride from start to finish.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Art 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is well suited, being able to properly highlight what one would call foodgasms in the anime, with the correct types of colours chosen to express how heavenly the food tastes and such. Also, the ecchi scenes are very well done :). Along with the proper lighting and colouring to present the food in the best light possible, the art is very well done. \\n\\n\\n\r\n-Sound 9/10\\n\r\nThe BGM in this anime leans more towards the side of intensifying the atmosphere, as in scenarios where Souma would seem to be in a pinch or such, the BGM would work its magic, supporting the visuals and story from the sidelines. The voice acting was also good for this anime, with the voice actors clearly expressing how the characters felt throughout. Also, a special mention to all the openings and endings of Shokugeki no Souma as they are very good. Sound effects which come together with the food such as the sounds of the food sizzling to make the food even more appealing or the noise of garlic being fried are also pretty similar to ones in life, making it even more enjoyable and some extent realistic.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Characters 8/10\\n\r\nIn general, most of the characters follow some form of common character stereotypes like tsundere, shy girls, etc, though they each do have their own deviations making them still unique. There are also a lot of characters who have a lot of pride or motivation over one thing or another, be it their own skills, own family restaurant, etc. This also makes a lot of the characters confident and they are also very capable of holding their own, making this an anime filled with badass characters. In addition, the female characters who tend to get foodgasms are meant to be \"attractive\", making the end result an extremely intriguing mix of \"pleasure\" and females.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nIt was always fun to see our hero cook up something to match up and even surpass the expectations of those around him, letting him somewhat be the underdog of the story. Throughout the anime, there are also very funny moments every once in awhile with how the characters act.  Along with the constant excitement of the next episode after one has finished, I would say that I absolutely enjoyed this anime. It was also fun to pick up some knowledge on food here and there, and looking at the food presented in the glimmering lights was a spectacle to behold. Lastly, the ecchi scenes which mainly involved foodgasms were always one of the biggest highlights of each dish, as it was hilarious to see how over-exaggerated they could make some eating something look.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Some thoughts\\n\r\nIn my opinion, this has been one of the most intense and addictive animes I have ever watched, and I would have never fathomed that it would have been of food of all things. With what I feel is a constant perfect mix of sounds, art and food, I do highly recommend people to watch this anime, as I'm sure that this fits the majority of peoples' tastes (literally and figuratively).\\n",

At first I though, \"A cooking anime? Huh? It's not real food, and cartoon food wont look all that special anyway.\"\r\nHahah! I was wrong as hell. The art is amazing! The food, though in cartoon form, looked extremely appetizing and delicious. I swear I'm going to be a chef too LOL. Every time I watched an episode I got hungry, and inspired to try new things in the kitchen! The imagery is wonderful.\r\nThis anime is also entertaining. Hasthe fun exaggeration and some fanservice that many anime have in order to lighten the mood so as not to be too painfully serious all the time. It isn;t a drama after all. They seem to touch each character (and there are quite a number of them), so good character development!\\n\\n\r\nThe competition is intense! It truly feels like a battle to determine who shall be the best of the best! Many people tend to get annoyed or bored of the explanations and reactions to the foods by the tasters but I find the metaphorical representations AWESOME! and a good way to show the viewer the differences in enjoyment of each persons food, since we are not able to taste it ourselves! I give this anime a 9!\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't stop watching. Looking forward to seeing more from this mouth-watering, visually spectacular anime. LOVE IT!",

Kitchen Princess was the only cooking series I heard up until this point and I absolutely hated that series.\r\nI didn't think I would like Shokugeki as much as I did. I thought the characters (with the exception of Erina) were funny and well-developed, the idea of a school where only the top 10% graduate was an interesting concept, and S\u014dma, although he has a bit of an ego problem, was able to back up his words.\r\nThe only thing that's preventing mefrom giving this 10/10 all the way through were the ecchi scenes. I don't mind ecchi in a series, but Shokugeki no Souma just took it over the top and made tasting S\u014dma's food, in my opinion, to be a bit exaggerated. \\n",

            "content": "Hey, Gordon Ramsey? Where did you go to become such a good cook? \r\nGR: \"Why, Totsuki Academy, of course!\"\r\n...K\r\nAhhh, Food Wars, everyone's favorite show about food next to Cake Boss and Hell's Kitchen. Located to the east of Flavortown, Totsuki Academy is where most of our story takes place. Grab a bowl of your favorite Weeaboo ramen and sushi and prepare for the taste of SHOKUGEKI NO SOUMA!\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe basis behind Food Wars is a fairly unique take on the whole Shounen genre. Sure, you got the same character stereotypes, but hey, it's the thought that counts.\r\nDuring the camp, all I could think of was howsimilar this was to the test at the start of HunterxHunter where Gon meets Killua and such. Meanwhile, the \"Shokugekis\" reminded me of the battles in Bleach when they were in Los Noches.\\n\\n\r\nIt's shows like these that makes identifying the differences of plot and story easier. Though the plot of Hentai no Souma is predictable, the story itself is unique and a very individual \"spoon of sugar\". \\n\\n\r\nDid I also forget to mention that the artist used to draw hentai? I didn't? Hmmm...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nYou know what a overly dramatic show needs?\\n\\n\r\nWhat's that, your favorite food anime ISNT overly dramatic and you feel attacked because I spoke badly about your favorite show of the season?\\n\\n\r\nBut anyways, overly dramatic anime needs overly dramatic characters! Yaaaaaaaaay~!\\n\\n\r\nThis guy is Yukihira Semen, our main protagonist of Foodgasm the Animation. Don't expect anything new from him, because he's just a typical Shounen protagonist that can only think about the genre and trial of the anime; in this case, food. I'm going to read a bit of the manga, so hopefully that'll add some personality to him.\\n\\n\r\nNow here's Nakiri (Not Kirino) Erina, the stereotypical Tsundere of, not just shounens, but ALL, that's right, ALL anime.\\n\\n\r\n\"Woah woah, Bright. Don't be talkin' shiz on my waifu. I'll have you know she's a Himedere; haderpaderp.\"\\n\\n\r\nOk cool. Unlike most Tsunderes, Erina doesn't show her affection to Souma as quickly as the generic ones. Though she doesn't show it at first, it definitely develops, just not as quickly. I'm hoping for some more of Erina in the manga.\\n\\n\r\n(Maybe it's the Himedere, you idiot fanboys\")\\n\\n\r\nOh also, her nickname is \"God Tounge.\" Umm, you should probably change that nickname, unless you want crazy lesbians attacking you.\\n\\n\r\nThen you got Tadokoro Megropey, the fanservice adorable cuddle fairy that you can't help but want to protect. Idk what it is with this season, but they helped me find a new kind of anime trope that I adore. \\n\\n\r\nThe character with a foreign dialect that's ashamed that it comes out sometimes. Sure, Marika from Nisekoi had this feature about her, but you only saw that when she was angry. \\n\\n\r\nAnother character that had this feature this season was Ebina from Umaru, but you'll see me fanboy about that later.\\n\\n\r\nMOVING ON!\\n\\n\r\nIts-a me, Takumi!\\n\r\nIts-a me, the other guy!\\n\r\nAnd together we're \\n\r\nThe Aldini Brothers! Wahoo!\\n\\n\r\nAh sweet, Nikumi. I don't even have to make a pun for her name because her entire character is a pun. What kind of food do you think she makes? Her name literally says meat in Japanese! Honestly, Nikumi was just there to provide fanservice for the guys who couldn't \"grab the meat\" hard enough from Not Kirino or Megropey.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then you got a whole bunch of other characters, yada yada yada. Basically, what I wanna say here is that there's a crap ton of characters in this show, so you're bound to like one of them.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC:\\n\r\nYes! Yes! Yessssssss~! The animation studios are finally learning that if you use your soundtrack, people will actually like it! \\n\\n\r\n*le victory dance*\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, probs to Shokugeki no Soma for actually using their soundtrack to entice the viewer. If I may complain about one little tidbit, it's that the opera son during the foodgasms became a bit repetitive and could've used some variety. Other than that, the music, including the opening and (kinda) the endings, were above average and entertained me.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nWhat advice can I give you about watching Food Wars? Don't watch it with an empty stomach.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, this anime will make you hungry like none other.\\n\\n\r\nAs for everything else art-wise, it's all mostly average from an averagely-budgeted anime.\\n\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nYou wanna know what I liked most about this show? The characters and story of the anime. I honestly thought I'd drop this show quickly, along with Arslan Senki, but both of those shows back in spring blew me away. The story kept me watching, but the characters were what made me truly enjoy the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, Food Wars, Shokugeki no Soma, or whatever you want to call it, is an interesting take on the Shounen genre and I'd recommend anyone who likes watching shows like Naruto, Bleach, or even a sports show like Kuroko no Basket, to watch  this show\ud83d\udc4c\\n",

            "content": "I have seen some pretty harsh review of this anime and seeing that I liked it so much (and a lot of people did), I am trying to perhaps give a more sensible feedback to someone that might be interested in seeing this show.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story is not yet clear to me and up to the point where the season ended it seems very straightforward and not entirely engaging as it is perhaps too linear and simple. But that is not exactly a critique, as the way it unfolds is fast enough to keep you hooked and binge watch it (at least that was whathappened to me). I hate spoilers, so I will make no actual mention of anything on the plot other than this: it is not a multi-timeline, complex war, multiple character, filled with lies and deception story. When you watch some anime you might think the characters are playing chess and everything starts to become very complicated. Not the case here. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that must be clarified: This show is mainly about cooking, so this should be clear. People describe it as harem, but they don't even understand what they themselves are talking about. If you like cooking, you will likely get a lot of what's going on and a few of the weird narrative choices that go on on the show. \\n\r\nIf you cook and try to cook well, you know that cooking is about giving other people pleasure, so comparisons between tasty food and sex are in the heads of every good cook. This is why they say, when you cook well that you can already marry and the silly jokes about keeping your husband/wife happy. If you are still not convinced , watch Nigella lawson's cooking show and you will see what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe Aime is beautifully drawn. This is almost an objective measure. Everything is very well drawn and animated, but what stands out the most is the level of detail put into drawing the food. The food looks very good and at some points you can almost taste it. The descriptions are good and it follow a \"Das Parfum\" (it is a book) narrative style, although not as good, but still. This narrative and the visual metaphors of people in ecstasy are very good in passing the feeling of something very tasty. I often would need to stop the show to eat something while watching it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nI have no strong opinions of the sound either way, but I really liked the song for the first opening (eps 1-12 I think) and the ending theme. On the second part I didn't find them so engaging. But I have almost nothing to say. I guess it didn't strike me as bad or good, it just fitted the show without standing out, which to me is a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\\n\r\nHere the show is perhaps a bit lacking, but I don't know, perhaps there are surprises in the coming episodes, although I don't believe that to be the case. Either way, one should look at what is there objectively, assuming these is all the info I will ever get. In this sense, nothing is really clear. The motivations of the characters seem plainly unjustified and this actually reflects on the story, since they don't really seem to be frivolous people - there just appears to be something missing. Why devote so much effort into cooking? At no point we can see any character give an acceptable response to this question and all of them seem to be devoid of any internal mechanism driving their actions. The characters are so linear, they just seem almost incomprehensible. We cannot seem to find any effort of the writer of the show to actually mend this, so one must take this show as it is and accept the storyline and characters are seen as background to display and tell us of marvellous cooking.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nEven with some setbacks, this show is still amazing. I liked every single bit of it and the only thing that prevented me to binge watching it all on the same day was that I wanted to save something for later. The story is light and well balanced and makes you feel good. It is not one of those shows that take your heart hostage and give you this end-of-life feeling after they end. This is just light, while being good. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis is perhaps a bit too much, but it is a personal opinion. I really liked watching cooking shows as I was a kid and seeing this anime which is kind of a merge between two genres was very interesting to me. I think if you like being provoked, like cooking shows and thus cooking itself, if you can enjoy some harem/ecchi scenes without being overly critical of their likelihood, then you will probably really enjoy this show. But there are some pretty harsh reviews out there, so I assume this anime really isn't for everyone, so I suppose for most people it is best to set yourself with low expectations and try to enjoy the show for the good things it has to offer and not complain about \"omg, there were no robots 0/10 wouldn't watch\".\\n\\n\r\nSorry for being too vague on my description of the show, it is just that I didn't want to reveal any plot whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nHope you found this review helpful.",

            "content": "What can I say about that anime... It's first time when I heard about anime with cooking as main topic.\r\n Suprisingly Shokugeki no Soma was very good, story was completely understandable and clear, but there were some cliches which sometimes destroys a climate in every anime that is over average.\r\n Visualy Shokugeki no Soma was outstanding. Characters, backgrounds and the most important - food - were drawn perfect. In fact watching some dishes made me hungry! Special effects and colouring style were also very good. Animation was smooth and dynamic.\r\nSoundtrack was also nicely done. Matching speed and intensity of music to action on screen -it's something that all series should have and Shokugeki no Soma showed it in a perfect way. Opening and ending themes were catchy and well animated with lively colours and special effects.\\n\r\nCharacters... our MC had his moments but I've seen better creations of \"almost badass\" and \"almost unbeatable\" heroes. I like Soma because of his weird sense of humor and his \"the best of the worst\" dishes! His attitude to friends and foes was also ok but sometimes... Well, sometimes he's dumb as hell... Other haracters were made very good - I mean better than our main protagonist. They were lively, realistic and very funny  and serious when they need.\\n\r\nThen why I gave SnS only 7/10 if I liked it this much? Because weak end. C'mon, it was disapointing and predictable. It's a big mistake to make show like this so good at the start to completely ruin the end. I think I would see 2nd season if some day it will come out but I don't think I'll re-watch this one.\\n\r\nFew words of recomendation: If you are intrested into cooking, good and original slice of life anime or just curious what contains anime about fighting with flavors then you should watch Shokugeki no Soma as soon as possible, but if you don't like cooking or slice of life anime then you just should pass it out.",

            "content": "Here is a dish that combine cooking, youthfulness, and ecchi-ness into one plate. There are already many reviews that said many things about SnS S1 as a dish - and here, i write what i couldn\u2019t find in those reviews based on what i tasted. And hopefully we can take a look at this dish once again.\r\nStory : 8/10\r\nI won\u2019t say many things because there are already dozens of reviews that talked about it in a more polished way. But it\u2019s definitely a classic shounen storyline. What i find interesting is the way the story get affected by Souma\u2019s personality and his way with words\u2013 exactly like what Isshiki said in the earlier episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Graphic : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s good. We can feel the shounen atmoshpere from the art and graphic. But there are also things that can be considered as \u201ccooked in a wrong way\u201d. Those are the miss-cooked ecchi-ness and the over-abundance of abstract backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not about the over-used of ecchi-ness, but instead it\u2019s about the approach. This anime, like its original version, has realistic and dramatic/hyperbolic approach to all of its genres, including ecchi. In this anime, however, the ecchi genre was taken differently from where it should be \u2013 and instead of each character\u2019s unique sexiness and natural charm, we can feel \u201cjello all over the place\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nIn the matter of abstract background, it\u2019s being used too much for its own good. Instead of giving impact to its context, it\u2019d be seen as non-proper animation.\\n\\n\r\nSounds : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds aspect is good, that i agree. But I found one thing that disturb me : the seiyuu\u2019s compatibility.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus played their work well, i think that\u2019s true. But some of them are incompatible with the character they played. The most noticable example is Hayama\u2019s. Hayama\u2019s seiyuu has this sound of an old man even though Hayama is a young man and is experiencing its youth. Junichi Suwabe would be more compatible if he had played Gin\u2019s role, and Hayama should be played with a seiyuu that has younger voice. There are many examples for this incompatibility, but i\u2019ll end it here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nA big number of characters is a potential on its own. But just putting them there without enough attention, it\u2019s nothing more than decorations. But nevertheless, all of the characters are quite, if not very, enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t enjoy this anime even though i love its manga version. There are some ingredients that have been cooked in a wrong way and ingredients which are incompatible with the dish itself. Those resulted in a downfall of my enjoyment. This title has many potential, but as an anime, in my opinion it fails to deliver those potentials.\\n",

But porn that's used to describe food, everything about food from its taste, texture, depths and origins. Just watching it makes your saliva drops even when you just ate.\r\nThe story is simple, yet outstanding. A simple boy thrown into an elite culinary school and turns out, he succeed in making everyone amazed. Though, it is not just that. It's also mixed with other characters background and stories and each of their connection with food. How Souma makes rivalry with outstanding chefs, each withtheir own powers. A lot of unexpected turn of events are blown into your face.\\n\\n\r\nI personally liked the art style. Modern and amazing, yet funny and hilarious. How each character is designed amazingly, they mixed it with some cartoon and chibi theme which is very nice. The sound is also mentionable. The sizzling pan, the boiling soup, knives cutting and sound of each bite from the foods makes you hungry every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters is nice and all, but I do feel some cliche in some aspects. Erina the princess type, Megumi the quite shy type, Takumi the confidence rival type, Isshiki the calm peculiar type, Hisako the loyal princess type and many others. Though each have their own uniqueness which good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is very enjoyable to watch. This anime has been on my PTW list for so long and I'm very satisfied that I finally decided to watch it and did not regret a thing. I plan to read the continuation on the manga probably.",

The artwork was good and enjoyable to see. Yet, it really cringeworthy of people being Overly Sexuallized when it comes to tasting delicious food or getitng undressed. \r\nWhen I first watched this, Ep.1 really attracted me because of Soma-kun'stalent to cooking. I see how this resembles to MasterChef (cooking competition show where food is the key to taking the top and being entitled as a MasterChef). \\n\\n\r\nGiven that the fact this anime is ECCHI, it also emits comedy on how the people/chefs go undressed while tasting food.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is really enjoyable to watch, I feel how Soma-kun really did hardwork and climb up using his cooking skills. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this to watch with your friends but not with your Mother and Father xD.

And the intense music just makes it all better. \r\nIts hard to say something about the plot - I marked it 10/10 despite the fact that it is still progressing and I'm having trouble guessing how its all going to end. It surely has the potential of becoming a very long series like Naruto or Bleach. Story develops at a reasonable pace. Not every day you get a series about cooking with a lot of action.\r\nI love the variety in character personalities anda relatively rich backstory every person has. There are no Mary Sues. Everyone seems real - with flaws they do not to address. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters learn something new and become more professional with every episode. Not just the protagonist - which is a great thing. \\n\\n\r\nOnce again - music is brilliant. Characters varied and interesting. Story with a lot of potential. Ecchi.

            "content": "This anime really takes the term FoodPorn to another level. Being an anime about cooking , you'd think there isnt much to go on as far as echhi is considered . But you couldn't be more wrong. With a vast array of busty ladies , the anime makes sure that with each bite of an amazing dish , these ladies' clothes get ripped apart and they begin to have an orgasm more stronger than one that even J.Sins would be able to give . And the anime isnt at all sexist. Its  all about gender equality with plenty of guys  geting stripped aswell. So the writers made sure to give the yaoi fans some love too .\\n\\n\r\nNow as far as the shounen tag goes , its pretty standard stuff what we get . The title itself is Food wars . So this anime has battles in the  form of food wars... these are basically cook offs . The only difference is the huge crowd cheering on..who just so happen to catch even the faintest whiff of aroma from the food. But unlike other types of shounen where you tend to get really bored after a few punches are thrown or cards flicked, this anime is anything but that.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest advantage of this anime is that it is a show about cooking . Hence obviously each dish will feature a different cuisine , a diiferent technique , different ingredients.. all making each episode ..NO! each challenge very interesting.. plus it teaches you about different foods across the world.. and it also makes you kinda hungry. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a good soundtrack and some awesome opening and ending songs . The enjoyment level is atleast a 9/10. But if you are a vegetarian, I'm afraid that you'll find this show rather biased to the more meaty side of the food world. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime features a wide variety of interesting cast.. some troupes which we have seen in  a lot of anime and are familiar with .... others.. not so much . So do give this anime a try as it will be really impossible for me to give a rough layout of the main characters coz honestly there are a lot . But the show doesnt let you have the same \" What's that guy's name again ?\" experience from Game of Thrones . They make sure to give a placard infront of each character giving a small desciption each time they are shown in different episodes. So you'll gradually learn their names ( not that it really matters ).\\n\\n\r\nIn my review i usually give a small summary of the plot going into episode 1 , but i think the animelist review is more than good enough .\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly , i'd just like to say that if you are looking just for an echhi anime with plenty of fanservice , id advise you to look elsewhere. The reason being that although it has the echhi tag , the real reason for its success is underlined by its shounen tag .. and it is the only reason that kept me wanting to binge on this anime. ENJOY!",

The character development was so good that I could remember everyone's names and know exactly who they were when they were mentioned by other characters.\u00a0There was never once in this season where I was bored, something exciting or hilarious was always going on. People's reactions to eating good foodon this show is priceless and it's not something you would find anywhere else!\u00a0This anime takes cooking food to the next level and it is not one you'd want to miss.",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Shokugeki no Souma. I was going to pass on giving this a review as its rated so highly, however three of the top reviews are full of anime elitism and I couldn't pass that up.\r\nThe story is pretty simple, though perhaps outrageous. Our main character is a boy named Yukihira, Souma. He is a chef, and his greatest ambition is to run the family diner and beat his dad in a cooking showdown. His father sends him to learn how to cook at the best and most elite cooking school in Japan. Most of the show isdedicated to Souma cooking and growing as a person, much like your typical shounen. \\n\\n\r\nNow you know a bit about the show, what do people find bothersome? Well wouldn't you know the show is ecchi and has outrageous scenes! The number one rule for posing as some anime connoisseur is to overtly bash anything and everything with an ecchi theme. The show is definitely over the top, and definitely trying to shock and flaunt its sexual themes. However imagery is a great way of getting across how the food tastes. We lack the ability to smell, to touch, and most importantly taste what we are watching, and, being told is amazing works of culinary art. The ecchi or imagery scenes both combine to form a comedic and sexy appearance along with a vivid and informative core. Thus leaving a consenting adult with a fulfilled and delicious experience, while leaving the immature palates with something akin to sour grapes.\\n\\n\r\nNow there was mention of the dragging out of certain episodes and certain events, namely the Autumn Elections. Now this I do concede is a touch of a problem. If you had watched this as it was airing you may wish to strangle the makers for all the cliffhangers and slow progression. However as this is a direct result of introducing and, progressing the so called shallow characters, I'm not sure its such a bad thing. During the entire Election process, most of the characters, including side characters had some form of growth. It was rather predictable, perhaps a bit tiresome to the more seasoned anime watcher, but still relatively tame and enjoyable to the episode long fights of this shows kin.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is simply awesome. Every scene was colorful and beautiful. The soundtrack was also great, even giving one of the catchiest song I've heard in awhile.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters are, well, strange. Each character has a theme or mastery of a certain way of cooking. This comes out as the character in general. This makes each individual feel like an individual and not just the sidekick or the comedic relief. However with the quantity of characters there is hardly any true development. Souma develops through the entire show, and is a rather enjoyable MC. Tadokoro, Megumi is a klutzy girl who has no confidence in her ability and was near expulsion from the school completely at the start of our show. Her transformation cannot be simply marked down to mimicry(in fact her cooking is completely different from everyone's in the show, goes to show the lengths posers will go). You can also spot more shallow or over time based growth as well. However like I mentioned above this is not where the characters shine. I enjoyed the characters but it does deserve a few points knocked off for being a smidgen shallow.\\n\\n\r\nNow we get to finally savor this show as a whole. I enjoyed this show immensely. Though not really deep or thought provoking, it still grabs your attention and doesn't let go for a single episode. This is also not your typical battle shounen which of course wins it a lot of points. So what does the show do poorly? To be frank, the ecchi was a bit tiresome. Though fun and interesting at first, the scenes that are more unique also take a good deal of time. The scenes towards the end felt a touch forced as well as boring and reused. However to me this is one of the most obvious and damaging bits to the show. As for food knowledge its rather interesting and oddly informative, though I don't know how much it is accurate or replicable, but that doesn't matter. A good show to me is enjoyable, its something that brings you back for the next episode, something that grips one or more emotions and can evoke them from you like your an open book. Shokugeki no Souma was a laugh a minute, and was just as good the second time I watched it as the first. Give it a try if your not a 13 year old trying to pass off as a twitchy movie critic. Or even if you are that twitchy 13 year old, listen to the tale that this show has served you.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Funny, great art and soundtrack. Spin on battle shounen, interesting but shallow characters, nevertheless very enjoyable. Recommend it!",

            "content": "!! POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING !!\r\nTo start this off, I have only been watching anime for about 4 months now so I am no expert by any stretch, but I have been writing for a while now and wanted show my love for this show through something I am decent at. But moving on now, this show holds a very special place in my heart since it was the first show I ever watched. So as you can imagine, I might be a tad biased. As you can tell from the shows I have watched, most all of them have been rated fairly well. But boy,what an introduction to anime was this show.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9\\n\r\nLet us first discuss the story, since that is most likely the most important part. The story is unique in its own way. Soma Yukihira is a kid that works at a small family-owned diner that is owner by his dad in the Sumiredori Shopping District. His dad leaves the diner and closes it suddenly one day suddenly after Soma saves it from being shut down. Despite Soma's efforts, Joichiro (Soma's father) shuts down the diner and forces Soma to attend a school called, Totsuki Culinary Academy. Here at this academy the students are mostly from elite families in the culinary industry. As the story goes on Soma makes friends and shows his skills to the school through shokugekis, or food wars. The first to experience his cooking is a girl named Erica Nakiri, nicknamed the, \"God Tounge\", through the entrance exam she is in charge of judging. I'll leave the rest to you to figure out yourself by watching the show. But by now you can get an idea of where the story is heading and I hope that works for a bit of a memory jogger. But, what makes this story interesting and different? The interactions of Soma and the uniqueness of his situation. I think what makes this so great is that he doesn't have some super dramatic background in which his parents died and he lived poor in the slums and had to work his way out of it. They take a kid who honestly has it rather comfortably compared to a lot of people and make him very likable. This is something not many people are doing nowadays, in my personal opinion. Most people now want to take someone from a tragic situation and make you feel something for that character, which in all honesty isn't difficult to do. Most everyone feels sympathy or wants to encourage someone who has gone through something terrible. But in Shokugeki no Soma, they take a kid with no terrible story to tell and put you on a rollercoaster of an adventure that makes you want to, bite your nails, celebrate, and cheer him and his friends on in their journey.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\r\nThe art is something that can really hurt your view of a show or really add to it. Personally, I really love the art style of this show. Every character seems to be done with detail and care. Not only is detail shown in each character, but the detail in background art and settings really makes this next level for me. You can tell the detail when you watch nearly every scene. Everything from the cherry blossom trees in the background at the opening ceremony to the notes and signs on walls in the school kitchens and in the Yukihira family diner. I think that details like this are really important and are too easily overlooked. Totsuki looks extremely pleasing as well. The art can add a certain feel to a place such as it does to the Polar Star Dormitory. I can't find any fault with the art besides just some things aren't 100% my idea style.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9\\n\r\nNow on to sound. I think sound is something that you can use that can hurt a show, but can help it so much more. The sound in this show adds to effect of each scene. Sound in this show is very key. Not only does it add for comedic effect, in scenes with Satoshi Isshki in particular (if you've seen the show you know what I'm talking about), it also adds a sense of depth in the scenes where the focused character is primarily cooking. In this show, you can hear pans sizzling, knifes slicing, and food simmering. This really immerses you in the story and the world of Totsuki and the world Soma and his friends are in, which you follow. Sound in every show is important but in this show, it is done very well. Even in things like the foodgasm portions this adds for another level of effect, because to just show something of that sort is one thing but for the sounds to be there it really does add a whole other level of what is happening.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are done very well. Although it is no Toradora! development wise, they do a good job accentuating each characters personality and backgrounds through each individuals cooking. I'll give a few examples. Soma's cooking shows his roots through his style of traditional common food instead of expensive luxury dishes. He can take expensive ingredients and use them in simple dishes served in his family diner. Takumi Aldini's Italian roots are most clearly shown through his use of traditional Italian styles for making his dishes. Like most traditional Italian cooking his methods are refined and proven. One of the many more example we can use is Erina Nakiri's cooking. Her perfectionist personality is seen throughout her cooking. She never fails to be just right on a dish. This further gives us a look into just how deep this personality of perfection she upholds really is. From the interaction of Erina and Soma to the rivalry between Soma and Takumi Aldini, and even the development of Megumi Tadokoro's personality and cooking is done well. Every individuals cooking develops along with their personality. Once someone in the show moves past a large personal challenge, their cooking improves and it's the same way vice versa. Each character makes you love the show even more. That goes for even those such as Nao Sadatsuka. Each character draws you in with their unique style of cooking and adds to the show and it's fulfillment.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Is this even a question? Not a single second of this show is wasted for me personally. The show, no matter the circumstance, has you captivated and thoroughly involved in the plot. The level of enjoyment I experienced while watching this show has really not been rivaled much by other shows. I certainly loved every second of this season and the rest of them too (which I highly recommend).\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9.2\\n\r\nI am giving this show a 9 and not a 10 simply because although it is amazing, it is not perfect. Would I recommend this show to anyone who likes anything ever? 1000% yes. This show is great and very well done. For me, this was a perfect introductory show and will probably rewatch it 100 times. I hope my review helped and I hope you enjoy the show if you so choose to watch it!",

            "content": "- English Review (Translated version)\r\nI admit I can't be completely objective with \"Shokugeki no Souma\". I am a chef by profession (and vocation) and it is a real pleasure to be able to see an anime focused on cooking in particular and gastronomy in general. I enjoyed watching the meticulous attention to detail, with a high level of documentation, that the creators have put into showing ingredients, techniques and recipes. Culinary knowledge is never superfluous and any way to spread it is to be thanked, especially in these times of precooked, instant noodles and microwave ovens.\r\nI really didn't expect much more than this when Istarted it. I mean, I was attracted to the theme, but I expected a rather mediocre anime in general. Of course I couldn't be more mistaken, because \"Shokugeki no Souma\" was a truly pleasant surprise. On the surface it is a pure and hard shonen (comradeship, clashes, good and bad, bad characters that become friend to make way for another bad character...) and that is something with which I do not usually like too much at this point. What makes the difference is that it does not take itself seriously, but neither does it become a pure and hard parody (which would detract from quality). It constantly moves in a line between the serious tone and the parodic tone, sometimes closer to one side and sometimes closer to the other, but without getting completely into either. And there lies the greatness of \"Shokugeki no Souma\".\\n\\n\r\nThen comes the absurd humour, in abundance and a marked fan service, which although it is not holy of my devotion, here he manages to go unnoticed thanks to the comedy tone of anime. The fanservice in the form of Kallen's ridiculous postures in \"Code Geass\" (a story that pretends to be serious) is not the same as Isshiki's ridiculous attire here. Both seem the same in the background, but in reality they are not, because while the former clashes with the serious style and even takes you out of action, the latter looks natural and fluid thanks to the very essence of \"Shokugeki\", so it is not out of tune at any time.\\n\\n\r\nIt conveys good roll, it transmits joy, something that is not easy to achieve. For this reason and for some similarity in its characteristics (especially that absurd humor) reminds me a lot of \"Gintama\", crossing the distances. But it doesn't just live on comedy, of course he makes you laugh, but he also manages to excite you, he keeps you in tension, he manages to move and touch you deeply. Everything simple, feeling innate and inherent, without any need to force anything. And as I say, it's something that has a lot of merit.\\n\\n\r\nThis would not be possible without a team of characters that was up to the task and \"Shokugeki no Souma\" has it. A tremendous variety of characters, but completely differentiated from each other, which makes you remember all of them without any problem, even if the plot leaves them out for several episodes. This is also helped by the great way they have found of reminding you on screen who's who. Of course, most of them follow common archetypes in the genre, but I would venture to say that it is impossible not to empathize or connect with characters like Megumi, Hayama or Soma (highlighting a decent protagonist seeing the last engenders in the shonen). Even with the large number of them, they are well built and little by little they are getting to know each other more and more, which increases the interest and sympathy for them progressively.\\n\\n\r\nThe other section that deserves to be highlighted is the musical. The level is simply spectacular and the melodies, whether in the most epic moments or in the quietest moments, are of incredible quality. A truly diverse ensemble that adds value to each scene. As for opening/ending the level is maintained (special mention for the surreal wonder that is the 2nd ending), but I want to break a spear in favor of not changing them in the middle of the season. In \"Shokugeki\" and as usual, they have done it, so there are four OP/ED in total, two of each. It's 24 episodes, is that really necessary? Does anyone think that in \"Steins; Gate\" (24 episodes too) it would have been positive to change the great opening \"Hacking to the Gate\" for another one? No, isn't it? Well, that....\\n\\n\r\nSee you in season two.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\\n\\n\r\nReconozco que no puedo ser del todo objetivo con \"Shokugeki no Souma\". Soy cocinero de profesi\u00f3n (y vocaci\u00f3n) y es un aut\u00e9ntico gustazo poder ver un anime centrado en la cocina en particular y la gastronom\u00eda en general. He disfrutado much\u00edsimo viendo el cuidado detalle, con un alto nivel de documentaci\u00f3n, que los creadores han puesto a la hora de mostrar ingredientes, t\u00e9cnicas y recetas. El conocimiento culinario nunca est\u00e1 de m\u00e1s y cualquier forma de difundirlo es de agradecer, especialmente en estos tiempos de precocinados, fideos instant\u00e1neos y microondas.\\n\\n\r\nRealmente no esperaba mucho m\u00e1s que esto cuando la empec\u00e9. Quiero decir, me atra\u00eda la tem\u00e1tica, pero esperaba un anime m\u00e1s bien mediocre en general . Desde luego que no pod\u00eda estar m\u00e1s equivocado, porque \"Shokugeki no Souma\" ha supuesto una sorpresa verdaderamente agradable. En la superficie es un shonen puro y duro (camarader\u00eda, enfrentamientos, buenos y malos, malos que se convierten en buenos para dejar paso a otro malo...) y eso es algo con lo que no suelo comulgar demasiado a estas alturas ya. Lo que marca la diferencia es que no se toma en serio a s\u00ed mismo, pero tampoco llega a ser una parodia pura y dura (lo que restar\u00eda calidad). Se mueve constantemente en una l\u00ednea entre el tono serio y el tono par\u00f3dico, a veces m\u00e1s cerca de un lado y a veces m\u00e1s cerca del otro, pero sin adentrarse del todo en ninguno de los dos. Y ah\u00ed radica la grandeza de \"Shokugeki no Souma\".\\n\\n\r\nDespu\u00e9s vienen el humor absurdo, a raudales y un marcado fanservice, que aunque no es santo de mi devoci\u00f3n, aqu\u00ed consigue pasar desapercibido gracias al tono de comedia del anime. No es lo mismo el fanservice en forma de posturitas rid\u00edculas de Kallen en \"Code Geass\" (una historia que pretende ser seria), que el atuendo rid\u00edculo de Isshiki aqu\u00ed. Ambos parecen lo mismo en el fondo, pero en realidad no lo son, ya que mientras lo primero choca con el estilo serio y hasta te saca de la acci\u00f3n, lo segundo luce natural y fluido gracias a la propia esencia de \"Shokugeki\", por lo que no desentona en ning\u00fan momento.\\n\\n\r\nTransmite buen rollo, transmite alegr\u00eda, algo que no es f\u00e1cil de conseguir. Por esto y por cierta similitud en sus caracter\u00edsticas (sobre todo ese humor absurdo) me recuerda much\u00edsimo a \"Gintama\", salvando las distancias. Pero no solo vive de la comedia, por supuesto te hace re\u00edr, pero tambi\u00e9n consigue emocionarte, consigue mantenerte en tensi\u00f3n, consigue conmover y enternecer. Todo sencillo, sinti\u00e9ndose innato e inherente, sin necesidad alguna de forzar nada. Y como digo es algo que tiene mucho m\u00e9rito.\\n\\n\r\nEsto no ser\u00eda posible sin un plantel de personajes que estuviera a la altura y \"Shokugeki no Souma\" lo tiene. Una variedad de personajes tremenda, pero completamente diferenciados entre s\u00ed, lo que hace que recuerdes sin ning\u00fan problema a todos ellos aunque la trama los deje fuera durante varios cap\u00edtulos. A esto tambi\u00e9n ayuda la genial forma que han encontrado de ir record\u00e1ndote en pantalla qui\u00e9n es qui\u00e9n. Por supuesto, la mayor\u00eda siguen arquetipos comunes en el g\u00e9nero, pero me atrever\u00eda a decir que es imposible no empatizar o conectar con personajes como Megumi, Hayama o el propia Soma (destacable un protagonista decente viendo los \u00faltimos engendros en los shonen). A\u00fan con la gran cantidad de ellos, est\u00e1n bien construidos y poco a poco se les va conociendo m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s, lo que aumenta el inter\u00e9s y la simpat\u00eda por ellos progresivamente.\\n\\n\r\nEl otro apartado que merece ser destacado es el musical. Sencillamente el nivel es espectacular y las melod\u00edas, ya sean en los momentos m\u00e1s \u00e9picos como en los momentos m\u00e1s tranquilos, son de una calidad incre\u00edble. Un conjunto verdaderamente diverso que otorga un valor a\u00f1adido a cada escena. En cuanto a opening/ending el nivel se mantiene (menci\u00f3n especial para la surrealista maravilla que es el 2\u00ba ending), pero quiero romper una lanza a favor de no cambiarlos a mitad de temporada. En \"Shokugeki\" y como suele ser habitual, lo han hecho, por lo que hay cuatro en total, dos de cada. Son 24 cap\u00edtulos, \u00bfde verdad es necesario hacer eso? \u00bfAlguien cree que en \"Steins;Gate\" (24 cap\u00edtulos tambi\u00e9n) habr\u00eda sido positivo cambiar el genial opening \"Hacking to the Gate\" por otro? \u00bfNo, verdad? Pues eso...\\n\\n\r\nNos vemos en la segunda temporada.",

If you are of a young age or you don't like to be looked at with a weird face, watch this anime in private. All i'm saying.\r\nStory: 9 - GREAT!\r\nThe story is pretty good, it starts off with a kid who runs a family diner with his father. One day his father puts the diner on hold for three years so the main character can go to a school to learn more about food. The story from what I see is amazing, therearen't very many holes everywhere and the characters don't just develop amazing cooking skills in one day. It really shows you just how much people struggle and it shows that even if you do have talents it is still hard to uphold your standards. The story gives off quite a few life lessons and some may even call it \"Inspirational\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 - GREAT!\\n\\n\r\nThe art was really good, you can see the artists put their time into making this, it's nice in any Definition, meaning you can watch it even in 360p and still be amazed by the art.\\n\r\nThe main characters usually have features that the other characters do not and most of them have really good art.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 - Outstanding!!\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was all amazing, starting from the Openings and Endings to the soundboards they used.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10 - Outstanding!!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were very good in this show, the amount of character development was good but still not too much which could be a good thing, the characters usually have something different about them and their traits and personalities are very nicely portrayed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 - Great! \\n\\n\r\nI personally loved watching this anime, it gives you a bit of a laugh at some points but the only downside I can think of is that it makes you hungry. The food's art and the art that is used when cooking is very nicely done and adds that extra bit of excitement to the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 - Great!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime was really good, probably one of my favourites. I would recommend this anime to anyone, but as said before, you should probably watch it in private.\\n\\n\r\n- Anthony\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll try and make this review as unbiased as possible, since there are both positive and negative points to this anime that delight and irk me. But overall, I quite enjoyed the anime as a whole. So, let's get this started. \r\nShokugeki no Soma is an anime where Yukihira Soma, a high school student with a penchant for cooking, is thrown into a strange new world of competitive cooking at the vaunted Tootsuki Academy, where the brightest minds in the world of food learn to cook the best dishes possible. He is transferred into the academy after his father suddenly decides to close the familydiner and travel the world to cook. So, that's the premise. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is something that you can find in most anime. The protagonist is a genius or incredibly creative. Soma also fits the harem protagonist mold of being incredibly dumb to the feelings that his female classmates show toward him. I really wish the author didn't take this route with the story. We've seen enough harem anime with the same formula so many times that it's started becoming unbearably bland. SnS is no different. There are times where you just become annoyed at why all these females fall for him, when all he does is cook well. (Well, maybe the raging orgasms that he gives them after they taste his food have something to do with it.) But I digress, the story mainly revolves around getting a name for yourself in Tootsuki Academy, where power struggles and quarrels are settled through competitive cooking contests known as Shokugeki. It's a very simple premise that the author has fleshed out well, even to the later points of the manga (which is progressing very well, if I may say so)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department is where I have a huge gripe. The music is okay-ish, with one or two memorable tracks, and most of the others being uninspired. Surely they could have done a better job of directing the sound here. But the voice acting is pretty spot on. The actors deliver the lines well and with emotion suited to the situation at hand. I suspect the recording studio had many an awkward moment when the actresses had to audibly orgasm each time their characters tasted a dish. I can't imagine that would have been comfortable, albeit it would have been fun. \\n\\n\r\nArt was something I enjoyed a lot in this anime. All the characters have unique designs and were animated brilliantly. The backgrounds were made well, and even the food looks absolutely vibrant delicious, which is what you want in a cooking anime. This is a major fault that I found in Yakitate Japan, where the food didn't really bounce off the screen. JC Staff have done a superb job with all the characters and you can't really find too many faults with the animation. One major fault that I just have to point out, since I am a fan of the series, is the boob physics. There are random moments where boobs jiggle around like they were made of jello, and at times, it gets pretty annoying. You try explaining to your girlfriend that you're watching a cooking show and not some weird hentai, especially with the frequent sounds of orgasming the ladies give. But yeah, that's the only fault that I really have with the art. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what I have a huge thing for in this anime. (Get your minds out of the gutter). Almost all of the main and side characters have a unique specialty with their cooking. One of them specializes with meat dishes, another with traditional Japanese foods, one has a special affinity to spices, etc. You can also tell that the author did extensive research for each character and the dish at hand (although I remember that most of the dishes were consulted by a chef/actress, whose name I can't remember, for the life of me). It doesn't feel as one dimensional as Yakitate, and you can see how much work was put into conceiving and making each dish in SnS, even the terribly bad ones. \\n\\n\r\nMy personal gripes aside, I quite enjoyed the anime and it's actually one of the very few manga that I keep up with on a weekly basis. If there's something I'd like to convey to you, the reader with this review, it's this. Do what I did. Watch the anime and then continue the manga. The story is definitely not one dimensional and linear. While the goal is to become the best of the best, there are pretty well thought out hurdles and challenges that make the entire story just a blast to follow with. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime did it's job well, and at the time of writing this review (a week away from the second season), the anime is something I'd say is definitely worth the watch. It's got the usual anime stereotypes and cliches, but it doesn't go heavy handed with it, and the overt reactions and orgasms sort of mellow to give way for a better, fleshed out, and detailed examination of how each dish was made.",

            "content": "Ever watch Food Network? Because if you have, you'll probably know what Shokugeki no Souma would be all about. It's Food War! Where foes and allies can compete each other with their own style of cooking. What is there to hate? Delicious food, passionate characters, competitive contest, and food that'll rip your clothes off. Yes, sure, I understand ecchi is not for everyone, but for SnS, there is a purpose and a point to it unlike majority of ecchi anime that does it solely for fan service and usually aim towards guys that likes woman's body and whatnot. This is a little different from youraverage ecchi anime. It's actually not even an ecchi anime, it's just part of the genre. Both guys and girls gets their clothes ripped off (visually, literally, but in anime perspective, not literally) from eating food that is so good, their clothes rips off. It can be rather dramatic, but I think that's a good thing because food is involved. I think for a person that enjoys watching anime and food, in general, will likely be satisfied with watching SnS. If my review isn't enough, read more on the bottom as I go into details.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Souma is the son of Jouichirou, the person that own Yukihira's Diner Restaurant. Souma's dad is a top notch cook, perhaps, even the best in Japan. He taught Souma about the basics of food because Souma got interested in cooking. Eventually, Souma declared that he will defeat his dad in cooking and take over his restaurant. However, to do this, Souma would need more than just his passion and determination. His dad, then gave him an invitation to a school that is all about cooking and more importantly, it is a prestige cooking school that does not accept some average cook. There is a high percentage rate of failing and there is no exception to that rule. Speaking about rule, not only is this cooking school the top of all cooking school, there is a unique rule about this school and that is through Shokugeki! Whenever you feel like it, you can always challenge anybody to a Shokugeki (a battle between two cooks, or possibly even more at a time). However, it will only work if your foe accept to a Shokugeki. Anyway, eventually, Souma notice and now understand why his dad tell him to go to this specific cooking school if he was serious about cooking. Before Souma even realizes, he has tons of enemies lurking around to fight him through cooking and allies to help him and even rivals. The concept of the story line is basically about doing what you like passionately, and not being pressured by people just because of something. If you failed once or a thousands time, do it over again until you get it right. Otherwise, you'll stay as a loser and will never change\\n\\n\r\nArt: I think the artwork is a delight and even the animation for the cooking process was well done. Yes, I understand that people doesn't like ecchi (so do I), but it is worth watching because the ecchiness of this anime is PART OF THE SHOW THAT MAKES IT RELEVANT. It is dramatic, but fits the part because we are talking about food here, it should be dramatic. Ever watched Chopped on Food Network, there is always a thrill of who gets chosen and who gets chopped. It's part of the fun and entertainment of the show and I believe SnS nails that portion. One thing I kind of dislike is too many female characters with big breast that usually shows a lot. I honestly, don't get it, about anime with big breast. I think it would have slightly improve the show if woman's breast was actually average. While, I'm not trying to be sexist or anything, it just that Japanese girls at around adolescent age down have big breast like that, I've seen Japanese drama and heard from people that has been to Japan before, it's nothing like that. Yes, I can understand, it's an anime, but still, I can see why it can turn down for people, especially girls. For guys, well, I'm pretty sure, they like big breast.\\n\\n\r\nSound: No problems here. Opening and ending does a good job delivering the sounds and visuals. Background sounds and effects are good. Followed by good voicing acting. It pretty much nails it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Lots of interesting character and some background to each. I do feel that there are some characters that are one-dimensional, which can be rather tedious. I guess, it's because there are so many characters that, the author doesn't have time to do all of them, especially the minor characters that only show for a couple of scenes and episodes. But other than that, Souma is a great main character, but I also feel like he is a bit too special that he is kind of non-existent in the real world. Not feeling pressured and don't really care much about pride is Souma well known trait said by his dad. I think this kind of trait is rather unrealistic because I feel that everybody has some sort of pride and has felt pressured by people in some way before. Then again, this is an anime, so that logic is forgiven, but just saying that it is one of the flaw.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As a person who loves looking at food, smelling food, touching food, eating food, and ultimately, cooking food, I fully understand what this anime is aim for and I appreciate the author mindset and creation for such a wonderful show. Anime relating to cooking is rather rare now these days. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I think giving it a 7/10 would probably be the least I could do to be fair to everybody in a objective scale, but personally, I'd give it a 9/10 because of my enjoyness of anime and food.",

I was damn wrong. \r\nThe thing about this show that I didn't expect coming in was the intensity. The stakes always feel damn high even and you could tell each character is practically battling with every meal. \r\nEven though the actual cook-offs are reminiscent of DBZ with the unrelenting explanations, the show manages to make it work in that the talking actually feels valid and useful. It doesn't feel like empty lines or just a rehash of common tropes (atleast most of the time). \\n\\n\r\nEven though some of the less involved characters seem like one dimensional tropes, their ingenuity in their cooking and their passion makes their character feel deeper. The more involved characters have adequate depth also (although Megumi's excessive shyness can bug me a times). Souma is basically just a run of the mill shounen protaganist in nearly every way, but you can actally feel the passion and ingenuity from him which makes him feel like so much more. \\n\\n\r\nThe show does have some shortcomings. The ecchi food scenes are a meh, but probably a bit excessive. I kind of wish the romantic elements were taken a little more seriously, even though that is clearly not the focus of the show. But all told the show is enjoyable and compared to the majority of anime a pretty fresh and original concept for a series.",

            "content": "Shokugeki No Souma or Food Wars is based off the manga by the same name. In fact I didn't even fully know what this was when it first came out and I skipped it. Now? I kinda regret that.\r\nHello fellow anime fans. For those that don't know I am Josh, and today I am here to review the first season of Shokugeki No Souma. Let's do this.\r\nStory- Story is simple enough. It's about Souma Yukihira, are MC in this story going to Tootsuki, the most largest and well known cooking school probably in the world in this story. His dad sent him there and nowhe is setting out to be at the top.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said the story is pretty simplistic and about cooking. I'll admit this really didn't interest me at first but I decided to check it out. And I loved it. Every single minute, I could not take my eyes away from my tv as watched this using my PS4. If I had to make some complaint is that they didn't give much screen time to character enough to make me care about all of them. And then there is the over the top foodgasms. For those that watched the show, you know what I mean. The foodgasms could be disturbing and over the top at times. Overall the story does get a 7/10 from me\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art is good. I liked it. I also liked the character designs. Got no major complaints. Overall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound- Voice actors are fine, got no complaints there. I love the first opening and first ending. The 2nd opening is fine but the 2nd ending...dear god. I love this show but that 2nd ending sounded so bad. That might be the worst ending I have heard in a long time. Overall the score is 6/10. Higher if it wasn't for that 2nd ending\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- I'm okay with Souma and Megumi and like the Aldini brothers and Rindou Kobayashi (technically she hasn't been introduce in this season but hopefully is in the season coming up next month. The rest of the characters are alright and I honestly don't have many problems with them. Granted there are a little to many characters in this that I could care less about, but other then that it is alright. Overall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- It had me hooked from the first episode and onward. I couldn't stop watching it. I enjoyed every minute of it and even had a couple of things I laughed at. Overall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Shokugeki No Souma is far from perfect, it has it flaws, but it is pretty simplistic and a good watch. I definitely recommend it. Overall I have to give Shokugeki no Souma an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, I am out people. Peace.",

The foodgasmz are the selling point i get it but its perfect in manga where as its like a overused assult rifle in anime\r\nSounds are awsome just awsome this openigs and endings\r\nAnother awsome parts are the endings (minus the ecchi)\r\n\u0130 must say this i love the gagsin this anime if it were a little bit more better at handling the ecchi the characters and the jokes-gags-tsun momments and much more enjoyable components would shine. \r\n\u0130 would haveliked to give it a 10 or maybe 9 but as i sait a million times to much ass and boobs just kills it not in foodgasm scenes but in the scenes where nikumi and the other females are its just anti fun\\n\r\n\u0130t would be ok if the main focus was ecchi like highschool dxd but this is a shounen and slice of life.

Neglectful parents aside though, this is actually a pretty decent show. The food is so good that I immediately went to the nearest convenience store and bought a bag of Flamin' HotCheetos because those are my favorite snack food and they were the only thing that could keep me from salivating all over my computer. The girls are sexy, the food is even sexier, and it all comes together so nicely that you forget that this is a show about a serial rapist. All in all, it's pretty tight.",

You might need a bit of \"weird humor\" but do yourself a favor and watch a couple of episodes, or atleast one you can jump in the anime if you like since i did that just to try and it didn't spoil my laughthing that much.. a bit since you won't understand the joke then m'kay.\r\nHonestly speaking i enjoyed it, couldsnap the brain off and have a blast. With that expectation i went into this anime since it will have a season 2 airing (hopefully also with 24 episodes) \\n\\n\r\nBad stuff:\\n\r\nWell the charetcter development is like not bad but more meeh sure, and the story is equal to that (meeh like its cooking for crying out loud..) so no it didn't make me want to go find the frying pans, or the stew for that matter. or try to remember who that other lady was because well she is basicly the same..\\n\\n\r\nGood stuff:\\n\r\nwere this show  really works, is the art, but i do watch some older animes so yeah.. don't compare.. the enjoyment and music. Especially the ending song usually i have that feeling that the ending song is you know not part of the anime'ish.. do your self a favor and watch the endingsongs atleast until you get tired of it. as for making the sound a part of the anime but not like with music animes that has music as an component or backline it does it quite smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment and fun stuff just hit right in the box, I WAS GAME, I FELT IT, I ENJOYED IT. The anime does this quite often reason for me pointing that out bigtime. and it doesn't feel like it draw a cyckle of the jokes they use or exitment parts of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThats all, super anime i do want a season 2 for and it leaves me hungry for more.. hehe",

            "content": "I loved that Mito was always introduced, not by her face, but by a close up on her boobs like that was just so funny and wasn't weird at all (also what were those sound effects on her boobs? That squelching noise as they moved together?? does she oil her boobs?? Because, otherwise, I can't imagine why they'd make any noise). Also there's this one scene were she's presenting her food to the judges and she's literally just standing there and yet her boobs are jumping up and down in the air like they have a mind of their own. Her boobs are obviously justreally enthusiastic about food like they have to show their excitement too, ya know? \\n\\n\r\nGirls apparently cannot stand normally anymore, they must always lean about in a way to perfectly showcase both their bum and boobs to the people. A girl, in order to be allowed the power of speech must immediately bends herself across a counter top, squishing her boobs out beneath her and sticking bum up in the air, before she opens her mouth. \\n\\n\r\nIn all seriousness, I am not at all a fan of the 'foodgasm' scenes. The fact that the characters in these sexual scenes were generally teenage girls doesn't sit right with me. There is a much easier, less sexualising way that they could have shown their enjoyment or hatred of the food i.e. they still have those fantastic visions when they eat it, but without the sexual vibes of the original. Children/teenagers should not be sexualised, in any context. Everything else in this show and series is so good, and I enjoy everything else about it so much, but these scenes do diminish my enjoyment by quite a lot. \\n\\n\r\nFavourite scene: whenever Souma whipped out his bandanna and put it on. \\n\\n\r\nAnother favourite scene was obviously when they were in the baths and the rubber duck went between one girls' boobs and she said, 'oh you naughty boy,' like that's what someone would actually seriously say to an inanimate object, not that her choice of her words were written in precisely to affect SOME watchers in a certain way. Did anyone enjoy that scene? Did anyone actually enjoy it? \\n\\n\r\nFavourite detail, whenever the seventh chair's bum cheeks showed emotions.\\n\\n\r\nGirl, in real life, wakes up: *groans, rolls over for just five more minutes* \\n\r\nGirl, in sns: *moans excessively* \\n\r\n(I'm talking about Erina when she woke up to have a peep at her photo of souma's dad - also I'm not a fan of that!! If she just admires him for his cooking, all is well - although I don't know why she'd stare at a picture of him and not his cooking to do that - but if she likes him, well, I don't gel well with that. Like, why can't she just look up to him? Why's she gotta be  all romance about him?) \\n\\n\r\nOn a more serious note: amazing, fleshed out characters, wonderful, fluid animation, a compelling storyline and cooking is suddenly exciting (although some of you may argue that it always has been; tbh, i really like cooking, so I'd maybe argue that as well). All the 'ecchi' scenes are a bit hard to deal with - so I deal with them by laughing at them - but the plot and characters are so good!! that I really do like it, and even though they are weird, all of the good stuff in this makes it well worth the watch. \\n\\n\r\nI really, really enjoyed this.",

            "content": "Reviewers point of view: The only knowledge I know about cooking and food quality is what I learned from 3 years of Food Network and Harvest Moon games. XD XD XD\r\nStory: For the most part, the story kept me entertained. Although I'm not a culinary expert, I know the basics and I couldn't wait to find out how the main characters were going to overcome each challenge. Even when certain details or foods showed up that I didn't recognize, they were ready with the description; almost like they knew I was about to ask. They described the food so perfectly that I could almost tasteit. True, because the penalty of expulsion or being black-balled was always hanging above the characters' heads, there were certain times when you knew there'd be a happy ending (you just didn't know how). But this happened so little times that it wasn't worth a deduction and the strict penalties also gave intensity to other scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was very vivid, colorful, and enticing ( XD )!!! I can't even count all the times I ran to the kitchen to eat something because the animation of the food made me hungry. I mainly look for anime that are pleasing to the eye and the graphics and animation were so fun to look at. However, call me whatever you'd like, I'm one of those girls that DON'T like fan-service (unnecessary nudity, strange and/or uncomfortable sexual innuendos, etc.). And this goes for all sexes, not just women. So naturally, I felt very uncomfortable when you have some characters walking around for almost THE WHOLE SHOW in nothing on but an apron. I didn't like those few episodes when you had judges who seemed sexually satisfied by EVERY MEAL that was sat in front of them. Not even going to get into the gravity-defying boobs. There were some times when the nudity was comical, but, just like food, you should serve it in moderation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I liked the soundtrack organization in the show. Each song fit perfectly with the scene, and I was able to recognize the songs without being distracted from the anime (which I think is good). I also liked the openings and endings. The openings were energetic and intense while the endings were cute, warm, and friendly; just like the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This was one of the few anime that made me care about more than 2-3 people. Not only did I sympathize with the characters, I wanted more than just the protagonist to succeed. The anime managed to avoid cliche by slightly altering the personalities, emphasizing the cliche in a comical way, or by presenting it in a viewpoint most people wouldn't consider to perceive it as. One critique I may have is how some of the recurring skilled chefs (mainly during the 2nd half) caught my attention but weren't given much depth after the main cast overcame whatever obstacle they represented. Some of the backstories took a while to explain and therefore should've been left out if the character wasn't going to be too relevant after the episode. Of course, there's another season, so these characters might get more depth later.\\n\\n\r\nExperience: Besides the few cringe-worthy fan-service scenes, the anime was quite enjoyable. Watching the anime was sorta like feasting on a guilty pleasure; I knew I had productive things to do, but I couldn't stop watching, and it's been a while since I felt that way about an anime (like I couldn't wait). Rather fitting for an anime about cooking delicious food. XD XD",

Where as some people shit on this anime, whilst others totally love it, I fall somewhere in the middle. \r\nStory - 8/10:\r\nThe overall 'plot' doesn't deserve an 8/10, but it's more the concept that I like. The idea of a cooking anime, which is a very unique sort of 'sports anime', intrigues me. It was executed well, on top of this, despite some of the major flaws I have with the anime as a whole. \r\nThe plot is good -- the fanservice can get insane at times, and actually managed to make me skip portions of the anime, as I was legitimately grossed outby what I was looking at and hearing. As a guy who enjoys horror anime, I'm not easily grossed out, but the borderline disgusting fanservice in this anime managed to push me over. If you can look past this, though, the story in general is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10:\\n\r\nThe art wasn't really anything special for me, but it didn't look bad whatsoever. Animation was smooth, so... yeah.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5/10:\\n\r\nI didn't particularly care for the soundtrack, especially regarding the OP and ED. It wasn't horrible, for sure, but it just wasn't that great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5/10:\\n\r\nI really wanted to like some of the characters more than I did. It's unfortunate that they didn't really flesh out the characters enough, something I'm deeply hoping they do in Season 2. This is most likely a result of them introducing a shit load of characters, and then having no fucking clue what to do with them. \\n\\n\r\nThe only character which I enjoyed the development of was Megumi, even though her character development wasn't the strongest. It was good by the end to see her working on her own, and not needing Soma to help her quite as much. Otherwise, characters like Takumi were relevant for 1-2 episodes, and then for the rest of the time were pointless background characters. \\n\\n\r\nSoma didn't really go through any character development whatsoever. He came in with the goal of graduating and being the best chef, and he maintained that goal, without any real obstacles. Though he goes through some brief development after losing to that-one-graduate-guy, it's not enough to redeem the lack of character development on his part.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10:\\n\r\nDespite the lack of character development, I really enjoyed watching Food Wars. I finished it in about 4 days, which is the third fastest I've ever watched a 24+ episode anime (Mirai Nikki and Parasyte being 1st and 2nd respectively). If you enjoy watching characters compete, especially if you enjoy cooking at all, this anime is very fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10",

            "content": "STORY: The plot contains character development and a journey for us to look forward to. The best part is the FOOD! Soma's Dad challenging his Soma to surpass him is the ultimate life goal. Soma is seen as the underdog due to his socio-economic status as a student in the culinary academy. The story also emphasizes on the culinary techniques & terms. There are also a lot of characters along the way and we get to learn more about them too.\r\nCHARACTERS: \r\nSoma: New transfer student to an elite culinary academy. He has some knowledge when it comes to culinary arts, but he is still learningand trying to surpass his Father. \\n\r\nErina: One of the best students in the academy. She has strong culinary skills. Erina is against Soma due to his status as a student and chef. \\n\r\nMegumi: One of the kind-hearted students. Only friend of Soma on campus. Megumi also wants to take over her family's restaurant in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\r\nThis anime is all about self-discovery and learning culinary techniques and skills along the way. The delicious food, great storylines and character developments are part of what makes this anime great! In some cases, we can also relate to the characters through an emotional, and personal level. There is also some comedic relief and hentai moments. (P.S.: IF ANYONE HAS THE LINKS TO THE RECIPES FROM THE ANIME... PLEASE SEND IT TO ME!!!)",

            "content": "This topic comes up all the time when talking about seasonal anime, but I need something to start off  the review with, so bear with me :P\r\nWhen viewing seasonal anime, there is always that one anime that receives immense popularity, whether that be from the source material, the genre it comes from, etc. However, a lot of the time the most popular anime is hardly the best one the season has to offer. It might be thrilling with good animation or a good soundtrack, but a lot of the time basic writing devices are thrown out the window (char. development, pacing, etc.) for shockvalue. So what does Shokugeki no Souma, the most popular anime of the Spring 2015 season by far, do to make itself worthy of it's popularity?\\n\\n\r\nWell, my answer is simple really. The thing that makes this show really compelling and a ton of fun each episode is the food. Shokugeki no Souma is really just a battle shounen, but replace the battle with food. Food is something we can all relate to, and not one single person hates a truly delicious meal. So to see these characters bite down into something that not only looks delicious, but the characters go crazy for, is the only reason I can fathom to explain the amount of excitement this show brings me. It makes you want to be there, enjoying that top class food yourself.\\n\\n\r\nIf this weren't the case however, all we would have is a completely repetitive shounen where the main character wins all the time. And while that is certainly the case (the latter certainly can and will bother some people), it manages to keep your interest despite this. I could give you the story structure that defines every arc in the anime, but that would technically be spoilers. It amazes me that despite this, Shokugeki no Souma manages to be keep the level of entertainment consistent throughout, which is an achievement in and of itself.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the cast, which is damn humongous. This is a problem that a lot of shounens, particularly long running shounen, have. You know, the one where you the side characters have their moment in the spotlight and then they never see the light again for 200 episodes. And while the spotlight is placed firmly on Yukihira Soma and his endeavours, most of the cast keeps relevant throughout the runtime (some more than others yes, but it's a step in the right direction). This might change in the future (if this show doesn't get more seasons than I will be thoroughly amazed), but let's hope it doesn't. I'm gonna take the time to go through the main characters and the supporting ones I liked or I think are interesting to talk about at least, so bear with me, this will take a while.\\n\\n\r\nYukihira Soma is pretty run of the mill as far as shounen's are concerned. He's hotheaded, hates to lose, and has the red, spiky hair to show it. Yet I wouldn't have it any other way really. If any other character was taking the spotlight, the show wouldn't have been as fun because of it.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi Tadokoro is the character who is very doubtful of her skills as a chef, and is incredibly timid. While she isn't the best character to do this, she does have great growth in her character, from going from the supporting chef of Yukihira to a great chef in her own right. This development handled this way has been done a million times, but it's development none the less, so I can't fault it too heavily for that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, we have the big bad bitch herself, Nakiri Erina. I honestly haven't hated a character as much as her in a while. I can't fault the anime for it, because we are pretty much supposed to hate her, but my god she's an insufferable asshole. All high and mighty, and won't accept being wrong even though she knows she is, etc. \\n\\n\r\nAnd here's a quick rundown of the supporting characters of mention. Megumi is wonderful, and is best girl for Soma, even though it will never happen (the Karaage Arc was one of my favourites). The Yandere girl introduced later in the anime needs mention too, and the way her character arc ended was really quite hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, my favourite character in the series, Ryo Kurokiba. When he is first introduced along with Nakiri Alice, I knew he was going to be my favourite character. He is normally incredibly clumsy, and talks with a noticeable disinterest of everything around him, but when he puts on his bandana, watch the fuck out. Such an interesting and fun character to watch, and I hope he gets his own distinct character arc at some point.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I'll talk about Akira Hayama. In the opening, they give him such a distinct place in it, signalling that he will be some really tough opponent for Yukihira, but I was really underwhelmed with him. He doesn't have much of his own personality, his backstory was only briefly touched upon, and he wasn't built up nearly as much as I hoped he would.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I'm obligated to talk about it, so might as well get it over with. Yes, there's foodgasms, hooray.\\n\\n\r\nWell, to be honest, there wasn't nearly as many really obscene foodgasms as I thought there was gonna be. The fanservice in general really wasn't that prevalent, which was kinda surprising to me. I'm not the biggest fan of it (haha so funny) but it at least makes sense in a show about over the top reactions to food. The animation in general was kinda limited, but what really mattered was how good the food looked, and the facial expressions on the characters, and they both were brilliant. The character designs (apart from the aforementioned incredibly obvious hothead symbol that is Yukihira's hair) were handled very well. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly didn't pay much attention to the soundtrack, but one thing I noticed was it's energy, which definitely added to the cooking scenes and their intensity. What really was the star of the show, however, was the voice acting. There's no point in having a show like this without having over the top yelling to conjoin with the reactions, and I have no complaints. Even Yoshitsugu Mastsuoka, who is almost always noticeably Kirito from SAO, sunk into his role perfectly. I never once thought that the guy playing Soma and Kirito were the same person until I looked it up, which is rare for him.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I enjoyed Soma throughout, I cannot with good conscience give it ridiculously high praise. Do I think it's one of the better shows of it's genre? Of course. And I really like how it was able to take all these elements that plague both battle and long running shounen, and turn them into either turn them into positives, or overshadow them entirely. However, that still doesn't make for a masterpiece of a show. Even if negative elements are largely overshadowed, they still exist. And no particular element was really balls to the walls amazing, even if almost everything was at a higher quality than most shows. That explains the somewhat run of the mill score, but I'd still highly recommend this show to someone who just wants to marathon a fun, entertaining anime with minimal bullshit that normally plagues most shounen anime.",

Well, with Shokugeki no Soma it was the exactly opposite: I only started watching it as a \"nothing to do, let's fill out time\" and it ended up being one of my favourite shows. Clean and coloorful graphics, well made and characterized characters, a really interesting storyline and some fantastic OP/ED. Also, the input situation of the \"boy who wants to get better\", being a common type in the shonen is kinda different cause of the different area of interest, making it even more unique. Moreover,the ecchi spots, the harem-like situation and the great variety of characters and stories that mix up make it fantastic and worth to watch.",

Food wars does a great job of giving great setting for the story which was very good in fact it was one of  the best storylines ever apart of an anime and the art was amazing as well but that's just my opinion. Nevertheless this is defined an anime worth a secondseason and I can't wait.:D. I gave this anime a 9/10, the only reason why I didn't give ot a 10/10 was bcause I thought the ending could've been a little better. Everyone and I mean everyone should give this anime a shot :).

There's large sequences of obvious fan service, ridiculous characters, and even some dramatic scenes. It parodies shonen style but it also adheres to the formula to push the plot forward. \r\n  Therein lies the problem with certain parts of Shokugeki; it changes tone so often that it loses gravitas when actually wants it. Megumi finally learns to overcome her anxiety and cook, but it's difficult to take the situation too seriously given how silly thesituation is. \\n\\n\r\n  Another issue lies in the show's pacing. Very little is often accomplished in a single episode and this trend is exacerbated in the show's final episodes. \\n\\n\r\n This is an anime for shonen fans who both appreciate the genre but also seek something new and even a little odd. It's not going to change your life but it might make you revalue the genre as a whole.",

            "content": "Overall interesting premise but missing characters development and just a pure urge to watch in the starting half of the show\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe idea behind the story is obviously one that will excite and intrigue. However, the first half of the season drags.\r\nI watched the first 6 episode in late 2016, and although I quickly zipped through the first two, I felt a drag as it went on, some places the story became too predictable, and made me feel that I would know the plot of the specific episode just by how much I had experienced the same genre (even without then food battles part)\r\nPerhaps it'sbecause the original manga creator was setting up and settling in for the road ahead, but I dropped the anime until the summer of 2017. \\n\r\nOnce I picked up the show again, I was still disinterested, watching through the first half nearly fazed nor much interested.\\n\r\nWe then reach the half way point, segwaying into the arc, the Autumn Elections arc (or at least the first half)\\n\r\nWe have figured out the strengths and weaknesses of the character and the formidible ones that'll keep up wiht the protagonitst, this was when my interest peaked.\\n\r\nI suppose it's due to the more advisory rather then complete defeat Yukihira has against his two main foes. Their formidible, yet their reachable, although the two Nagiri are for another season and another time.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nI try to think that the more times the show presents nearly all shots as one I could use as a backdrop on my phone or computer, the more I'll phrase the show, and this show has merit.\\n\r\nThe normal anime-typical scenes of people talking in a courtyard in the schoolgrounds looks fine,and I would have put this at a 6 or 5, HOWEVER, somthing has to be said about the well done animetion when it comes to the food.\\n\r\nAlthough I had dinner jist before watching, my mind would taunt me on the taste and smell of the food. \\n\r\nAnd of course, there is a win to be had for the rather comedic reactions to eating the food, with people having mini-gasms (as I would call it) in public when eating these food masterpieces.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nI just have a rule as well that, \"if there is a theme that you can't forget, then it's at lweast something special\", nothing particular stood out, but it still kept up with the rhythm of the show, and aided with it's highs and lows.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\\n\r\nI barely liked any of these characters.\\n\r\nAlthough there were some enjoyable ones here and there, overall, character developement was weak, with characters coming in and out wiht only a hint oftheir potential as both a supporting character and a person of their own story, and just simple stereotypes.\\n\r\nNow, I love having a stereotype or two, it makes things different, shows different perspectives, blah blahblah. But, when nearly all stereotypes are just there to perpetuate them, I think it's over.\\n\r\nI felt sad that interesting character went down the gutter for the new and fresh allies and enemies, such as Mikumi, who could have had some interesting developement, and yet turns into this token character who crushes on the protagonist. To have an interesting character that is striped away of any normal growth makes me sad. And although I haven't watch the newest seasons, I fear that it'll happen again, and todays adversaries will be tomorrow's dull and token side character, and I worry of this when I step into the second season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nI dunno. It could have been a 8 . . . if the characters we're more interesting or I didn't have to rather force myself into finishing the first half. \\n\r\nI recommend this show, but with caution of a rather dull and predictable plot in the beginning.\\n\r\nAnd also to be prepared for interesting characters, introduced all so early in the story to suddenly be a background charceter in the later arc.\\n\r\nI AM going to watch the next season, as I DID enjoy the final stretch, more of my curiousness of the scores in the election then anything else. \\n\\n\r\nForgive me for such a long draw on story, I really wanted to explain my rather big surprise in becoming a bit more invested inthe series after thefirst half.\\n\r\nI felt that since it got so far as the receive a THIRD season, I should give it another shot.\\n\\n",

            "content": "First of all I want to state that I absolutely adore this anime. I find it super fun and super entertaining. It's overall structure just perfectly fits my liking. Then I've been reading a lot of negative reviews on Shokugeki and I have to admit that they are mostly correct about what they state, in my opinion. It doesn't change my view on this anime though, but I encourage you to go read some low rating review to get the bigger picture.\r\nSo what's good? It just somehow thrills me watching teenagers cook those superb meals with a little bit of a twist from what mygrandma used to cook for me. Grandma also didn't explain anything about how she made the meal and what kind of procedure and ingredients she used to make those miracles. What is more meals which Soma and the others cook just make people tasting them blush! There is something strangely amusing about school girls tasting meals and melting under their taste. I am generally not an ecchi fan, at all, but I find it hilarious in Shokugeki no Soma, for some reason.\\n\r\nAnd there you go, this is what to expect. I won't go over the plot, because it is impossible not to spoil it for the lack of it. Don't worry though it is not story driven.\\n\\n\r\nConlusion: If you keen on deep story and good characterization{(don't watch anime, #nokappa(talking about the characterization)}, you won't find this anime interesting or amusing at all. But if you have the ability to get absorbed by the anime's mood, go for. Might still not work for you, but it's worth the try.",

            "content": "\"Glad you liked it!\"\r\n--Soma Yukihira\r\nNormally, I don\u2019t really like cooking shows. I myself can\u2019t cook at all, so watching people get excited for stuff like Chopped or the million Guy Fieri vehicles on Food Network just baffles me. That said, I was hearing a lot of great things on anime message boards about a little show called Food Wars, also known as Shokugeki no Soma. Particularly, the second season was currently airing at the time of this review and receiving an outpouring of praise by voices I respect in the anime community, so I decided I had nothing to lose in giving it at leasta couple episodes to see what it was about.\\n\\n\r\nAs it turns out, Food Wars is perhaps the biggest surprise of my anime watching experience so far. I went in fully expecting to hate it, and what I got was one of the most consistently entertaining, engaging, and quality shows I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nFood Wars follows Soma Yukihira as he attempts to make his mark in the cutthroat world of Totsuki Tea House Culinary Academy, the best culinary school in Japan with a graduation rate of less than 10%. At this school, your skills are your life, and dictate whether or not you will survive to study another day or face expulsion. The titular \u201cshokugeki\u201d, which roughly translates to \u201ckitchen duels\u201d, are Totsuki\u2019s primary source of meaningful drama.\\n\\n\r\nSoma as a character is very much a shonen protagonist. People look down on him for being a transfer student who worked in a diner serving common food for the common man before coming to the academy, but one-by-one he silences his doubters. He proves himself to be imaginative, quick-thinking, and skilled in the kitchen. This earns him the respect of the viewer, and admirers and rivals amidst the student body and even a handful of the school faculty. The working of shonen tropes into a cooking show is something I did not think would work, but Food Wars makes it work by infusing the proceedings with just the right balance of lightheartedness and seriousness.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two main characters are Erina Nakiri, a stuck-up and self-absorbed \u201cojou-sama\u201d who sadly does not develop very much in 24 episodes. She\u2019s a prodigy, everyone knows it, the end. On the other side of the spectrum we have Megumi Tadokoro, a hopelessly out-of-her-depth dormmate of Soma\u2019s. Megumi is just adorable as a foil to Soma\u2019s cool and collected dominance of the kitchen. And admittedly I\u2019m a sucker for a girl learning to have confidence in herself and her chosen profession.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the three main characters there is a huge host of students, teachers, alumni, and cooking professionals, but the entire cast is very well-fleshed out. In fact, the strongest thing about Food Wars is its ability to quickly introduce and establish a very large and diverse cast of characters and making nearly all of them relatable and a pleasure to watch. Each character has a memorable gimmick to their cooking or design that I never once felt lost. As a failsafe, nametags are present in the corner of the screen explaining a character\u2019s name and occupation or role within Totsuki Academy to refresh the viewer\u2019s memory almost every episode.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the show is well-animated and crisp. The color palette is rich and vibrant. The character designs are gorgeous, as are much of the settings and background art. Nearly every dish that is presented looks mouth-watering, even the ones that are supposed to be gross. The fan-service is pervasive and over-the-top but kept brief enough that it never derails the plot. The guys at J.C. Staff know their stuff when it comes to putting together an appealing presentation.\\n\\n\r\nFood Wars also has an engaging OST of uptempo music that really sells what would otherwise be two high-school kids tooling around in a kitchen as a dramatic and high-stakes battle of wits and will. The sound effects are also great, from the sizzle of a frying pan to the roar of the Kitchen Stadium crowds. The Japanese voice acting is fantastic, and there\u2019s a lot of relatively fresh talent in the cast.\\n\\n\r\nFood Wars is a show that has something for everyone. If you\u2019re something of a gourmand or culinary-inclined, the cooking is well-researched. If you\u2019re a casual viewer like me you can get drawn into the characters and comedy. If you\u2019re looking for ecchi, well, you may be a little disappointed at how brief the lewd shots are, but you\u2019ll keep watching anyway for the reasons I listed above. I didn\u2019t want to acknowledge this show\u2019s brilliance at first, but like so many of Soma Yukihira\u2019s dishes, all it took was one bite to put me on my knees in defeat.\\n\\n\r\nUntil next time, may your dishes always bring plenty of umami.",

This is definitely one of those shows that you can feel yourself get immersed into the show and feel like you're actually a part of the group. Be warned that if you have no tolerance for ecchi whatsoever then this show will not work out for you, because the cornerstone of the humor in this show is a mixture of chibi animations and well timed ecchi moments. Another great part of the show is itsanimation of the cooking process, this show will definitely get you super hungry so be warned! The art is nothing new, but I thought the animators drew the cooking scenes really well. Along with the art, the story of the show is nothing to blink an eye at, but as I stated earlier the show really shines in it's comedy, cooking, and characters.",

            "content": "Shounen anime with ecchi and harem categorization usually no longer clicks with me really well (now that I'm much older), but given the high ranking on MAL for the anime. I decide to give it a try. \r\nStory: \r\nTypical story of high school man entering a school, except that this is highly competitive culinary school. The fact is that while certain chef might be revered in the states, but most chef are making significantly less than waiters, at least for starters, at least casted some doubt in my mind in terms of how realistic this anime is. Soon enough, I realize this is a shounenanime - I should cast the realism aside. That being said, the comedy by exaggeration here is used really well. Naked man with apron, Meat general, the typical kicking and punching mixed in really well the story. This is in my opinion, a comedy for foodie. I did learn at least some good knowledge on cooking and food in general. (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nAnimation is smooth, not many reused frame at all. Characters are depicted in colorful, vibrant color. The major criticism is the heavy sexualized roles of basically all female characters, especially during the tasting of supposedly very yummy food. Why do every single female character needs to go through orgasm when tasting? Clevages, bouncing boobs and tentacles on naked female body are all at least unrealistic. There are scenes where it was so detached from the actual real world that I just simple don't believe in it. That being said, how the anime describes taste or fragrance is pretty creative and unique. (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nSome reused music (e.g. from ReLife), nothing special nor bad. (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nHere kind of lies a problem. There are too many characters. While that might be OK with a longer TV series. For a 26 episode anime, the amount of characters resulted in the non-existent development for basically any characters outside of the main characters. By the end of the series, do we know anything about the smoke dude? or the wild anime lady? That makes the characters in the anime fairly forgettable outside of the 3 main characters. And honestly I don't see any development for Soma either throughout the series either...(5/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe comedy aspect of the anime is spot on. The amount of exaggeration usually resulted in hilarious moments overall all the episodes. Not gonna lie. As much as it is detached from reality and sometimes it is too much, I'm pretty amused at how everything can be connected to ecchi. Tasting bad food usually resulted in ecchi moments. Asking judge to taste your food also results in ecchi moments (Nikumi). Tasting food resulting in ecchi moments. The comedy aspect of the anime, in my opinion, is still the strongest aspect of the anime that makes it very enjoyable. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's an entertaining video. Is it memorable for ecchi? Maybe. Is it memorable for it's comedy element? Probably not. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Do I think it's overhyped? Definitely. \\n",

            "content": "Story: 9\r\nOnce upon a time, there was a guy who kept losing named Yukihira Souma who wanted to be a better chef than his father. The story is able to draw in the interest of many people (myself, included) and made itself worthy of it's ranking as of April 14, 2017, which is currently a 8.59.\r\nArt: 6\r\nThe art is very nice, putting in the typical cartoon style during comedic effects and other typical stuff. The Ecchi? Definitely not necessary. We know why they put it there: to add emphasis to the consumer of how amazing their food is, but really? This is a PG-13 anime,and you decide to put in a *cough* \"meat master?\" Yeah, we get by their complements and stuff like that, but the imagery? No.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nI honestly don't know why people are hating on the opening when I go to YouTube. They aren't horrible, people (well, maybe the 2nd one was mediocre). And the actual sound? It had room for improvement, but they were on par to have the viewers listen to what an actual kitchen sounds like.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nPeople have been in agreement of how the last episodes introducing random characters were pretty bad, and yes, I agree with that. Just tossing in random characters with a huge backstory made the entire anime seem rushed at the end. It just didn't fit as well as it should have. But the character development? On par! As we see with one of the main characters, Megumi, she goes from being a timid girl to being more open to others, especially Souma. And finally, an anime without romance despite there being a guy and a girl (Just kidding. I know some others that do this, too.) \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in the anime was not too excessive, and I would actually kind of say some did make me laugh. But as I said before, the ecchi! Like, fanservice almost stopped me from watching this because of this, but I eventuality got over it. I definitely enjoyed this, and other would agree.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8",

It might be casual for someone, but this is really interesting, as it takes time to emerge. Failures are part of his adventure, as well as victories. This is a simple history, but still it's very attractive.\r\nArt:Mmm. This is very cool, original concept. People tastes every dishes and start exulting like what the hell, a funny ecchi i'd say. They start having orgasm andstrip. SNS is also very good to follow some new dishes you wanna do, it's an original form of cooking, each plate looks absolutely good, except sometimes Soma and Joichiro's joke plate.\\n\\n\r\nSound:Nothing to say, this is very good, I don't think there are any negative points on sound, this is very clean.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:Character development might be short, but I like their personality(except Megumi, I don't like it that much)each character has his own personality, different from each other. Some are very competitive and meticulous, some are badass as ****, or some aren't very serious like Soma. I like them a lot!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Perfect. I laughed from A to Z in this show, ecchi scene are very funny, the environment is adorable, character too, I loved seeing new dishes arriving practically every episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: My favorite anime I think, I enjoyed it from the last second, the season 2 is as good as season 1, and, as scan reader, am waiting for this season 3, knowing it'll be badass as hell. I hhiiiighly recommend this anime if you like food, ecchi, comedy and \"school life\"(as it's an academy)",

            "content": "What this show is great at is taking the shonen formula, and use it as a way to show both gratifying victories and depressing losses through the various cook-offs in the show.  The show really knows it's main characters and highlights what they do in their ups and downs.  You connect with them and rejoice when they barely pull through like any good shonen should. What makes this show great is how it celebrates the victories. How the cast realizes they've tried their hardest and that their work has paid off.  The second season continues with this, by building up scenarios wherenot every character can come out on top, but each gives their all in getting as far as they can. \\n\\n\r\nThe only downsides for me are the gags used for describing the food which just gets old rather quickly. Those gags are most of the comedy which also just wasn't funny. The show also has an issue with 2 tsundere characters who at times are just excessive and irritating without much of a reason. Similarly to the last sentence, some characters are just too unlikeable, an issue that is fixed for some in the second half, and for even more come the second season. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Shoukugeki no Souma is a very good execution of a shonen in the aspect of characters, but if you're looking for a comedy, this probably won't do.",

            "content": "Me-\r\n-dio-\r\n-cre.\r\nThe syllables I can describe Shokugeki no Soma with. It's good, but not amazing, neither is it horrid. It's not a transforming rice seasoning dish, neither is it some weird grilled peanut butter level type thing. \r\nFood+boobs+The Good Shounen Archetypes=This thing.\r\nShokugeki was without a doubt, a very enjoyable anime. Humour was great, and to be honest it was what kept me going to watch it. But everything else other than my enjoyment, was a weakpoint, slowly kicking at the table legs while we wait for the Table to just completely fall off, bringing all the food to the ground and plates crashing.\r\nOkay let's get tothe actual review rather than having to go through my horrible food references.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound-7\\n\r\nI'll tackle the mediocre parts first. The soundtrack was fine. It was okay. The songs were funny when they needed to be, I guess. It's not a \"God only Knows\" level soundtrack, but at least the OP is good exercise music. The art was fine, the character design was one of the things that impressed me with this show. In terms of production value, the show knew where to put its priorities...the food. Duh.\\n\\n\r\nStory-6\\n\r\nThe best way I can describe this show is \"a Sports  anime, without the sport.\" And if there's anything that I hate more than Sword Art Online, it's sports Anime. Shokugeki is the closest thing I've watched to a Sports anime. Now let me describe why I hate animes of this type of genre. They usually take something, and drag it out. And I mean REALLY drag it out. It takes a whole four episodes to get through the Climax. FOUR. EPISODES. The story was nothing special, we can all agree on that,I don't expect any social commentary from a food anime, and neither do you. , but the fact that they know this, and do nothing to make the show even more slightly interesting  other than shoving some reused gags in there as well as some Oppai...well I don't think you're trying hard enough. It just lacks that...spice! (Sorry not Sorry) And by that spice I mean a main goal. The story had no actual goal other than \"I need to get better than Daddy Yukihira!\" for our main character. And I don't only mean character goals, the show in itself had no goal in itself. I'll namedrop a few anime that I found more enjoyable than Shokugeki but was in a similar situation as this show. Kabaneri, it had a goal to give the viewer something cool to look at, and at the same time make us feel some sort of emotion. Angel Beats, it was mediocre...but the humour and characters kept us going, the romance and action was below lackluster, but despite the number of its cast, we were still attached to all of the characters. More into that in the next part of my review which is...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-5\\n\r\nOkay, Fanboys time to bring out your tissues. The weakest point of this whole show is its characters. Now, let's count all the characters. Right how many characters are there...one, two, three...HMM, I DON'T KNOW TWELVE?! And now, in contrast, let's see how many characters were actually Enjoyable...Soma, Erina, Megumi...Right. THREE! I think Aldini's character description in Episode 20 can describe every other main character who aren't those three. \"Vaguely Uninteresting.\" Thank you for perfectly summing up your cast for me, writers! \\n\\n\r\nI felt no certain attachment to any of the other characters, other than the Aldinis (and that's merely because of personal reasons) I was really happy to see the vast amount of cast, and they're certain differences despite some being clear copies of usual Shounen archetypes, I thought it was going to hit me in the emotions when they do something cool, like how I felt with the other characters in Angel Beats. But, no. I felt nothing. When...what's her name...smiley blonde chick did the thing with her curry and made everyone happy, did you care? Probably not. When purple haired boob girl did the thing with her curry, did you care? Probably not. When glasses guy did that thing with his curry, did you care? Probably not. I think you get the picture here.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\r\nYou see those tags up there? Comedy, Food, Ecchi. Expect nothing more. It is a mediocre anime, with mediocre story, mediocre characters and nice animation. However, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the experience. I loved watching it, not because I sympathized for the characters, or was kept on the edge of my seat, but because it was fun. It was a fun anime to watch, and it was a fun experience. Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.",

And the 24th episode is a loose, sticky turd fighting against the pull of an understrength toilet bowl, sighing at last as it emerges victorious.

The fact that it literally doesn't end anything, and it's like the previous 23 meant nothing?\\n\\n\r\nAll of that.\\n\\n\r\nI still recommend this series absolutely.

            "content": "The story is told from the perspective of a young boy, Souma, though it shifts to other characters multiple times for brief moments.  The episodes fit in well together and didn't feel stretched or rushed.  No episode could be considered \"filler\" - they all contributed to the overall storyline.  The story itself wasn't complex but neither was it predictable.  It had a simple charm that kept the viewer on their toes and wanting more.\r\nThe art style was well-done - it definitely reeked of higher quality than most other anime I've seen.  The characters were drawn out to be seductive, especiallythe females.  I believe the goal of the director was to create a \"sexy\" anime by visually working through the characters' personalities and physical dispositions. The style and quality of the anime remained constant throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting felt odd initially - almost as if many of the actors clashed directly with the characters they voiced.  Over time their voices settled in and \"grew\" on the characters at hand.  The background music as well as both the intro and outro fit in with the theme.  The sound effects of the food being cooked was uncannily realistic - this was something that caught me off guard.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters weren't well-rounded but they weren't basic either.  The show made an effort to highlight their feelings and thoughts.  It definitely succeeded in doing that.  However, none of the characters seemed to evolve personality-wise.  The show focused too much on their evolution as master chefs and failed to keep their personalities in check.  Over time their thoughts and emotions took a repetitive and boring turn for the worse.\\n\\n\r\nThis was an enjoyable anime to watch, generally speaking - very humorous and enticing.  Some scenes of this anime were close to being NSFW which may hinder its reach to younger audiences.  However, I'm confident many anime and non-anime viewers will enjoy this show.  If I have time in the future, I may rewatch Shokugeki no Souma - it's intriguing enough to pique my interest a second time.  If you're looking for light humorous entertainment, this is the show for you.",

This ends up with mostly being ecchi stuff, like people losing their clothing, but can be fun (\"Oops. I turned into a young girl for a second\" hint hint). Tragically, I think the writers must have had a hard time writing about food as it mostly boils down to \"The umami of this works well with the umami of that. The sourness enhances the umami. Umami this, umami that...\". It's like 90% of all taste is suddenly umami. I call that \"bullshit\" or \"horse crap\".\\n\r\nArt & Sound: The shows art style is nice and flexible, switching fluently between detailed drawings and a more simplistic style (usually when the character aren't acting seriously or for comedic relief). This is well done and goes well with the show. Also, the food is nicely drawn and kinda makes me hungry sometimes. The sound is also very well done, with nice voice acting and good sound effects.\\n\r\nCharacters: The character are a diverse trope filled with most of the stereotypical characters, some mixes and a few, a bit, original. They are enjoyable enough, but usually doesn't get you too invested in their lives.\\n\r\nOverall: Shokugeki no Soma annoys me often, especially with way they describe flavors, but it's a fun watch with enough to keep me watching it all the way. If you're not super against flashing of skin (with awkwardly placed light beams or items placed in front of the more daring areas) or drawn underwear, and want some, over the top, extreme comedy this is a nice watch. Intensive, mostly brainless fun.\\n\r\nEnjoy!\\n",
