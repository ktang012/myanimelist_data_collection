Browsing through the shows I landed upon this one, and what I saw for 40 minutes, did not disappoint me.\r\nWhile others will disagree with me, I genuinely feel that Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara is one gem of an anime. A sweet take on the everyday life of a couple will make any depressed or grumpy guy happy.\r\nChistao is a working woman in a company. Pretty, reserved and excellent in her work. Sora, her husband, works in a bar. The anime dealswith Chi-chan being welcomed or treated to a drink by her husband everyday, and the cuteness that un-follows thereafter.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to think, not much to debate while watching the anime. Just kick back and relax as you see a cute couple still enjoying their days. It's an overall enjoying package and honestly for a 3 minute short with 13 episodes a critical part by part analysis seems foolish.\\n\\n\r\nChi-chan and Sora are really couple goals. Chisato is for sure my waifu of the season. Her drunk face, her serious face and her face filled with the love for her husband are too damn cute. If only there were cute girls like that in real life(deep sighs of regret).\\n\\n\r\nRather than reading the many review, go watch it. You will not be disappointed unless you have made up your mind to hate it.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. About the many alcoholic recipes given in the anime, I tried to make a few. It was hard and didn't taste right. Something is best left with the professionals I guess.",

            "content": "Love is Like a Cocktail (AKA: Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara) represents everything that\u2019s I hate about the romance genre. Maybe you\u2019ll have more patience for it, but I\u2019m a pretty cynical person by nature so I struggled to not look at it spitefully. \r\nThe worst issues that plague this show:\r\n1. A man gives woman alcohol for the first time, now she\u2019s an alcoholic. (Great influence! Why not marry him!?!)\r\n2. She marries him to have a personal bartender. (a Hilariously misguided example of romance.)\r\n3. Guy buys his wife with alcohol. (There\u2019s more to love than just substance!)\r\n4. She becomes drunk very easily and throwsherself at him. (Wow nice life lessons!) \\n\r\n5. A \"romance\" starring adults is written with all the seriousness you'd expect of Umaru-chan. \\n\r\n(If you wanted to make a goofy romance, then alcohol-fueled relationships was not a good choice. It could have easily been a drama if they didn't approach a careful subject like alcoholism with so little care for the gentle subject.)\\n\\n\r\nYou can\u2019t teach an audience that a relationship works that way. Love doesn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t work like that. Alcohol doesn't work like that! When you\u2019re making an anime (watched mostly by kids or young adults) then it\u2019d probably be a good idea to consider your audience. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of this show\u2019s agregious issues it also fails to provide a decent watching experience. Despite being only 3 minutes long it is incredibly repetitive, each episode has the same sequence of events and it isn't funny or entertaining. The show has a simple but kind-hearted intentions that just don't come across at all. It wants to be cute and heartwarming but instead it borders on insulting. \\n\\n\r\nEvery episode a stressed-out businesswoman, Chisato, is comforted by her husband, Sora, with alcohol and/or food he prepares himself. Chisato and Sora have no chemistry, other than she likes the drinks that he makes and he likes feeding her. There is no spark between them. I wouldn't even believe that they were married if there wasn't an obligatory backstory episode. \\n\\n\r\nLove is Like a Cocktail is just a cooking show (and not a very good one at that) with a seemingly obligatory romance tacked on. Look no further than their undercooked relationship, there's no chemistry!\\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship is platonic at best, toxic at worse. No one should take their relationship seriously. This isn't what healthy romance looks like, it's poison and could never exist this happily in real life. Sure, if there were other qualities that Chisato and Sora loved each other for I could see it being more believable. But there are none. The show does not develop them past, a cute tired woman who likes alcohol, and a bartender who likes cute woman.\\n\r\nDanna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken this is not. \\n\\n\r\nStory 2/10 What story? +1 for a generously brief length.\\n\r\nArt 6/10 Fine. The food and drinks look\u2026 edible I guess? \\n\r\nSound 6/10 Nice ed. The voice acting is ok.\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10 +1 for the lemon.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10 The lemon was pretty funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3.0/10\\n\r\nIt's bad. Not just for short-form anime. It fails because it doesn't try to create a convincing romance or realistic characters, instead it just forces overbearing cuteness onto you. Maybe cute lady drinking alcohol is all you need for 3 minutes, but there should be something more.\\n\r\nPerhaps you may get some fleeting enjoyment from it if you are more tolerant to problematic disposable entertainment than I am. But for me 3 minutes a week is far too long to waste on this drivel.",

It's basically a legal drug that gives you the power of unconditional happiness and the ability to enjoy yourself and express yourself to the fullest.\r\nThat being said, drinking (in moderation of course) is nice, yeah. But you know what's better? Watching a composed and serious office lady flip her moe-gap switch to the blushy-cuddly side as she got drunk, probably in the cutest way ever. \r\nPLUS:\r\n- Mrs. Mizusawa herself. What a lovable girl.\r\n- And together with her husband, I think they're the cutest couple of this season.\r\n- I'm sureit wouldn't be hard for the ladies to fall for the diligent and caring husbando Sora.\\n\r\n- Some cocktail brewing tips at the end of every episode. Like, very simple ones. Nice extras, no?\\n\\n\r\nMINUS:\\n\r\nIf you seek interesting story or good comedy, i'm afraid you'll be dissapointed. It's pretty obvious since each episode is only 3 minutes long and doesn't have much to offer strict viewers. It's only a few minutes laid back before bed.\\n\r\nPersonally i think with budget for a short animation, the creators've done a decent job. But harshly saying, story, artwork, animation and sound really does look mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, what should we say while enjoying this cute version of \"Bartender\"?\\n\r\n\"SHIFUKU!!\"",

Even then, the lemon mascot (that shows up a lot) though he's expected character design for a mascot isn't that bad either. Either way the animation is pretty good if only because of the detailed cocktails.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting....well LA already said it but Eri Kitamura is MVP in this anime short if only because of her great transitioning between strict and focused office lady accenting to delightful drunk.\\n\\n\r\nOsake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara is FAR from being a horrible anime short, it's just merely a relationship of a husband and wife with alcohol involved and how they help each other from the worst or best of times and the alcohol in question is NOT brought up in a bad light and THAT is quite something even for an anime short.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you wanna see Eri Kitamura beergasm then Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara has your order.",

Unwinding with a bit of alcohol of course!\r\nThat's basically the gist of this little short called Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara. It's all about married couple Sora and Chisato enjoying their couple life by having Chi-chan get drunk.\r\nIt's a three minute short so you shouldn't expect much in the way of story, though the anime did surprise me by having, of all things, a two episode arc detailing the couple's first encounter. That was a nice touch the show decide to put at the end to give a bit more closure and also asa chance to have more cute moments with the two.\\n\r\nThe entire show is built around these cute moments. Nothing really matters aside from these. Well, maybe aside from the drink recipe you're shown in every episode. If you feel like it you could probably make these drinks on your own since they're really simple, I however haven't tried it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat else is there to say, really? The animation is below average, being mostly very still. The music may as well be non-existent and as mentioned above there's really no story to speak of.\\n\r\nWhat you see is what you get: a lovely, perfect couple and some drinks which make Chi-chan go all red and adorable.\\n\r\nI recommend watching this once a day, or once a week since it could get old watching what is essentially the same few story beats over and over again.\\n\r\nIf you do decide to give this anime a try you'll find a relaxing three minute show that will make you wish you had a wife like Chi-chan or a husband like Sora and maybe also a cold drink in hand.",

They just find as many web manga/4-koma manga, no matter the quality, to adapt. I fully admit that there are some redeemable things. The ed is good. Drunk moe girl iscute. But seriously mon, ask yourself, is that worth it? The characters are bland, uninspired, etc. It seems like they've been purposely created to make you viscerally go aww but really their relationship dynamics are nonsensical. The guy is a stay at home husband which is cool and everything because it's a twist from the way it usually is but this is literally the only point of his character. His only perceivable trait is that he is super nice, the perfect hubby. I feel like he is nothing but a wish fulfillment fantasy for women who have no idea what a relationship is like, let alone a marriage. Marriage is complicated and this show shows none of that. It's not even funny. In three words, it is bad.",

A good anime\r\nAs I have said many times, finding series whose protagonists are a couple is difficult and the issue is even more complicated if you are looking for a place where both are married. And I say really married, those contraptions of an arranged marriage (not consummated) where nobody wants to be; or that couple that is committed, but by third parties and in reality they do not feelanything, they do not strain anymore.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nEspecially since at the end of the day it is obvious that the intention of the authors is to \"get out\" of the clich\u00e9 of the epilogue couples by \"putting them together\" at the beginning; but in the end, however theoretically they may not be, in fact they are epilogue couples.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if we get into comedy, the matter is even worse because it is almost a rule that the couple is not together.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the premise is attractive. It is a couple where he is a master to make cocktails and she is an alcohol lover who gets super sweet when she gets drunk. A couple sent to do. In fact, they know each other when she went to have a drink at the bar where he works.\\n\\n\r\nObviously it is that dynamic of her being super serious and cutting when she is sober and super tender when drunk; and he is always looking for ways to make her drunk to enjoy his cuddly wife that moves the whole plot.\\n\\n\r\nIt is this premise that moves all this anime and as every series that shows a recurring pattern, there is always the risk that it ends up being boring for the repetitive. However, it is the variety of situations that give freshness to the couple's interactions.\\n\\n\r\nThere the manga shows that while you can find variety in the details, repeating the same structure is not a bad approach; and the anime knew how to capture that essence and capture it faithfully and impeccably in each of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAt a technical level it is not a series to highlight, the animation is regular, the design of characters too, the soundtrack does not have much to offer except the ending that lets itself be heard; and the management, although it was not extraordinary, has the merit of having found the ideal way to faithfully adapt the original material.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, a series that will not be in any top, but that is one of those different and interesting things offered by the season that has just ended. If you are looking for a light and entertaining comedy do not hesitate to give this series a try.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal rating\\n\\n\r\n6.5/10",

            "content": "We know that one can not demand much of an anime with time around 3 minutes per episode, but even an anime like that has to have criteria. As a development of a story, the characters, appropriate scenarios, moral of the story, techniques well used. Unfortunately this anime did not live up to expectations.\r\nThe story is about an alcoholic woman, in which she should produce comical or sexy moments after drinking. From the perspective of being an anime of short duration does not require a dense script, with deep dialogues, yet it does not comply with what is available. The scenes that should be sexyor comic do not construct dialogues or images that emphasize or convince this.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters are at their worst, the author seems to be bold in moments, but overall he is only committed to feminist, politically correct, and \"morally modern\" clich\u00e9s. There is an inversion in the amime of the roles of man and woman they occupy in society, which is bold, yet it does not seem to be so daring in the scenes when they demanded a little more female sexuality. The woman several times shoots, then cuts the scene and ends the anime frustrating who watches, but if they had a little bit of eechi maybe they could convince and even become funny.\\n\\n\r\nScenarios are limited, within what was expected, the picture quality, stroke rule, sharpness and focus are satisfactory. Although it does not have large fluid scenes, but it is within the proposed and without disappointment. If in other of the quests the anime sends badly at least in this one he is well, presenting / displaying no great error.\\n\\n\r\nWith regard to techniques what bothered was the sound. The male voice actor, Ichiki, Mitsuhiro of Sora was very annoying, and the lack of a soundtrack, of music, made all the difference to not transmit any emotion. In the other technical aspects no major problems were perceived.\\n\\n\r\nThe end of the anime, the last three episodes give an improvement, with finally some evolution in history. Despite being a flashback, there is the construction of a novel with a good development and repeating only in the last episodes. We can say that it is the only thing that really saves the anime and possibly also the lemon.\\n\\n\r\nSoon the anime if it is that we can call thus, does not have a satisfactory moral conclusion. It could be said that this is a bad taste of alcoholic drinks for women, in which the message is to marry a bartender, make him your domestic servant, and get drunk that he will love you. There is also the fact that the target audience is likely to be younger because it is an anime and without strong scenes that can not go on television at any time, even when there should be a better construction of the plot.\\n",

            "content": "This anime I want to say is nothing special but then I remember that is a complete lie. Time to read too much into a 39 min anime (closer to 33 from closing credits).\r\n1. Q: Are the characters lovable? \r\n    A: Absolutely! I've not seen much of this season to my own regret but I can still say this is one of the best couples I have seen in a long while. \r\nThe main couple is once married so instead of the classical cringe of them never admitting their love when it blatant here it is reminded they love one another everyepisode. \\n\\n\r\nThe greatest representation of this is when Sora comes down with a cold and Chi cooks for him. Her ability to do anything is shown to be horrendous but for her husband, she tries multiple time to get it right. \"Through sickness and in health\"\\n\\n\r\nEvery other episode is a representation of Sora's love for his wife, Chi. The greatest show of this is when Chi tries to go without alcohol for multiple days. He is shown to be depressed as her condition worsens from fatigue to where he makes a drink specifically to help her. After such, he is shown to be restless in bed without her as he stares at his clock seemingly counting the minutes without her.\\n\r\nLeaving bed he walks to her workroom to find her asleep on the computer the complete report beside her. With a smile, he picks her up and carries her to bed before kissing her and complimenting her. \"To love and to cherish\"\\n\\n\r\n2. Q: Did I enjoy the anime? \\n\r\n    A: Yes! It's very much an adult Himouto! Umaru-chan. Each episode gives you a different drink to try and to go along with diabetes from sugar overload. Maybe not that second part but it sure felt like it. Having now tried three of the twelve they've shown, egg shake, fake beer, and Irish coffee, they seemed to be pretty good. \\n\\n\r\n3. Q: What did I dislike about the anime?\\n\r\n    A: The length of the episodes, but I feel if they were longer the appeal of them would drop. The main part of this show really seems to be showing different types of drinks. In a thirty minute episodes and or a movie-style anime that feeling would be lost. \\n\\n\r\nWith each episode being short there aren't many changes in personality. That doesn't mean there isn't a story you can read into. I say this because there is a story that if you sit down and ignore the drinks you can love and enjoy.\\n\\n\r\n4. Q: Closing words? \\n\r\n    A: Much like everything else this isn't perfect nor is it for everyone. This is about two people who found their love for another from a fateful day of tripping and alcohol. A wife who feels she can only show herself when drunk and a husband who indulges her in said fantasy. It's three minutes each episode and I greatly suggest watching.",

            "content": "As someone who hates alcohol I found this show to be horrible and greatly disturbing. The show is all about a MAN constantly taking advantage of his SEX SLAVE (read as wife) by using DRUGS such as alcohol to loosen her inhibitions so he can RAPE her, EVERY NIGHT. Now our girl Chisato wasn't always a horrible drunk, but she was made that way by a MAN.\r\nThe origins of Chisato's alcoholism is revealed in a flashback later in the series. Back when she didn't have a crippling alcohol addiction, then everything changed when a MAN introduced her to alcohol as a fun thing to drink.He lured her in with a sweet alcoholic dessert then as the night went on he continued feeding her these sweet cocktails until she passes out drunk in the bar (I bet that MAN RAPED her while she was passed out). From that moment it is all down hill for Chisato as she is addicted to alcohol now and is all but forced to marry the MAN that started her addiction in the first place. He used alcohol to start her addiction and then using her FORCED addiction he continued to string her along with alcohol until she became his SEX SLAVE (read as wife) and sugar mommy so he wouldn't have to work (truly this show is nothing but RAPE CULTURE propaganda propped up by the PATRIARCHY).\\n\\n\r\nThese tragic events lead to the series proper in which each episode we see this STRONG INDEPENDENT WOMAN come home to her leach of a husband who feeds her alcohol until her inhibitions are loose enough that he can RAPE her. That is pretty much the story for every episode. The only saving grace of this anime is that it is so short.\\n\\n\r\nAt a merciful run time of 3 minutes every episode, which is thankfully cut even shorter by the 30 second outro of a fun little ending song with a cute lemon person riding a motorcycle (The only good part of the show in my opinion), I still cannot recommend this to anyone but pedophiles, racists and republicans, after all RAPE is still RAPE no matter how long it lasts. I really liked the little lemon person though so I am adding plus one to the overall rating of the show, and with that I give \"RAPE is like a FORCED ADDICTION\" a 2 out of 10 and a recommendation to skip it.",

Looking for something that felt like nothing more than a casual, happy-go-lucky type anime, this satisfied what I was looking for.\r\n    The jist of the story is that a corporate businesswoman named Chisato is married to her bartender husband, Sora. Chisato is normally very quiet and conserved at her job, but hides the fact that she has a large alcohol intolerance, essentially being a \"one-shot wonder\". This anime is a nice little relaxing series about hergetting drunk and the cute happenings that ensue.\\n\r\n    There's honestly not much to critique about the anime; I mean, the episodes are only a few minutes long. The art and sound were on par with expectations, and there is a lack of character development as there is no real storyline to this series.\\n\r\n   I definitely enjoyed this as something no more than a cute, romantic anime I'd watch all over again in my free time. But if you are looking for something with a storyline, or something with development, I suggest you go look someplace else.\\n",

            "content": "There really isn't much to say about the plot of this series or its characters, its just the interactions between a bartender husband and his wife who when she drinks she acts all cute and drunk when she gets a different each night. And its the same repeated joke in nearly each and every episode. \r\nThe two main characters are simple, in which I know they are married and have jobs, that Chisato is reserved and works hard at her office job and her husband Sora, is soft spoken and caring to his wife.  I just don't know much about their personalty beyond thator even anything about the supporting cast as well. With little comedy in each episode that kind of got a chuckle out me, the same setup and same joke in each episode makes it predictable and tiring to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was surprisingly good for a series with only a three minute run time per episode. It looks fine for what sets out to be with characters looking good and the drinks looking colorful and distinct. Yeah I'm not a person that likes alcohol that much but they were good to look at. As were the voice actors they were fine for what they given to do, though I was not a fan of the ending song. \\n\\n\r\nI have seen many short anime series with three to five minutes of content each episode such as this, some of have been great and some have been terrible, Love is like a cocktail falls right in the middle. Its not bad nor is it good, i just personally find it average, though I do wish that the relationship between the main characters was better explored in some of the episodes.  It still is fine especially when I took my time to watch each episode a little at bit throughout my days of watching it, then I would have if I watched it all in one day binge.",

            "content": "Every now and then, you see one show in a season that no matter what other shows you watch it sticks in your mind, and slowly but surely it becomes your AOTS, or Anime of the Season. Osake wa fuufu ni natte Kara is my AOTS for Fall 2017, easily edging out Urahara and more importantly edging out fan favorite Shokugeki no Souma's third season. How? How did such a small and less known (in comparison) title beat out Shokugeki? Read on and find out.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nBeing my first entry to the \"short anime\" sub-genre, I felt quite irritated at first that a show was just3 minutes per episode and thought it wouldn't be able to pull it off. Boy was I wrong. The central theme of Osake wa Fuufu was Alcohol, no prizes for guessing, but it wasn't just alcohol, no no, if that was true it would never have beaten Shokugeki (I'm bringing it up constantly since it's also a show having to do with a consumable, food compared to Osake which is also focused on a consumable, alcohol). What made it superior was the relationship between the characters, their interactions, the brilliant way the anime showed how alcohol takes it's place in different times of the day and at different situations. There was no central plot, but there was alcohol, and there certainly was a lot of cute moments WHICH by the way, were totally still related to alcohol. The most amazing thing with the anime was that Alcohol became the story, the plot. Coupled with the fact that it marvelously mixed alcohol with every other aspect of the anime, I give it a standing ovation. If only it had been longer, if it were a full length anime I'd happily award it a 9, no joke.\\n\\n\r\nWord of the paragraph: Alcohol\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was a wonder to watch. Since it was based on booze, the booze HAD to look good, and it looked damn mouthwatering. One of the wierdest points I felt in a good way about the anime was that the art, especially the alcohol looked oddly satisfying. Character designs were different from the generic style in the way that the colors were way more rich (like a good glass of bourbon) and what was the cherry on top of the wine was how cute they looked. Chi-chan could easily be my favorite character design in the WHOLE of 2017. Not exaggerating. More praise coming in the character part. To end the art section here, it was as mentioned before: Oddly Satisfying. 'Nuff said.\\n\\n\r\nWord of the paragraph: Booze\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom the cute and perfect Seiyuus to the addicting ending song to the sound the liquor made when it was poured into the glass, the sound section was amazing and easily one of the best parts of the anime. Chi-chan was adorable (wait for the character section for more), Sora too sounded like the perfect husbando and the other supporting cast also sounded very much like real adults just going out for a drink. The way the VAs made adult drinking life sound so relatable to adults was a huge help in bumping that score up to a whopping 9. A standing ovation from me for sure.\\n\\n\r\nWord of the paragraph: Liquor\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEasily my favorite part of the show, the characters were beautiful, both by looks and personality. Chi-chan was so perfectly and so realistically done I can name her my Waifu of 2017 in just a heartbeat, NO OTHER CHARACTER came EVEN CLOSE to her quality. Why? Relatability, the \"moe\" effect, heck, even spirits helped her boost her appeal in my eyes to that of \"Waifu of the year\" (though I'd prefer calling it \"Best female character of the year\"). You might think the male's side won't have the spotlight, well you're wrong, Sora ALSO takes the top cake as \"Husbando of the year\" (once again, I prefer it to be called \"Best make character of the year\"), why? He's perfect! He's charming, he can cook, but most importantly, HE CAN MAKE THE BEST ETHANOL. Not just that, a later episode also shows the backstory of how they met, why an I mentioning this? To prove that this anime isn't all ethanol everywhere (although admittedly you won't be wrong if you guessed alcohol snuck everywhere too). \\n\\n\r\nAfter almost a paragraph of praise you look at that score of 8 and look at me confused. Why 8? Why so much praise then? Well, some of you might have noticed that I haven't talked about the supporting cast at all. Sadly this was the problem this anime faced. Being a short anime, it couldn't focus on the supporting cast at all... They were shown at some points but looking for the impact they made is like looking for a needle in a haystack... The supporting cast was barely shown and you might bring up the excuse saying \"but Osake focuses only on Chi-chan and Sora\" to which I say then why bring up the supporting cast AT ALL then? If you show them once, make them appear frequently if you can't develop them. That at least would be enough to make me give this a perfect score... But to end in a good note, Chi-chan and Sora alone handled it all by themself, if the supporting cast disappointed me, the main cast FAR exceeded my expectations. Both of them won my Character of the Year. That's enough to make me happy.\\n\\n\r\nWord of the paragraph: Ethanol\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nA 10? What?! How? An anime about intoxicating drinks got a 10/10 from a non-alcoholic drinker? Impossible? Baka-nano! This wasn't according to keikaku?! This is all I expect from you to say (minus the last one). Well, what can I say. I loved every bit of this anime. The characters were my favorite part of Osake wa Fuufu. Chi-chan and Sora gave me diabetes from sugary moments. To say that Osake Fuufu had a lot of sweet moments is a gross understatement. It was like I said, DIABETES worth of sweetness. Couple goals, sweet, relatable, making-you-jealous-of-being-lonely, an anime that restores your faith in humanity. All this is what I and many other watchers felt from watching Osake Fuufu. And this was just on the surface of the cake, if I went beyond I wouldn't be able to end this review and would likely hit the supposed character limit for a MAL review. I have yet to decide on my AOTY but I doubt Osake won't make the Top 5, if not the top 3.\\n\\n\r\nWord of the paragraph: Intoxicant\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.2 (Averaged)\\n\\n\r\nOverall Osake Fuufu is an anime that surpasses most full length anime, even though it had a measly 3 minutes on hand. It didn't waste those 3 minutes on pointless filler, beach episodes, hanabi festivals. It used up it's weapons very wisely and didn't waste them away. It was centered on Sake. But what was arguably better was how well the main characters were presented; Sora and Chi-chan. I've seen some good female characters over the years, and very less even moderately decent male characters. I felt this year was vastly inferior to the past years (my mean score chart took a huge dip from the previous years and 2017 is my lowest rated year in THIRTEEN YEARS, since 2004. I didn't expect much from Osake. But what Osake did was shatter ALL of this, it gave me 2017's best female character, it gave me 2017's best male character, and though it couldn't do much to keep this year's mean up, it certainly gave me something to feel positive about 2017. It made me end my anime year on a good note. Arigatou Osake wa fuufu ni natte Kara for making me feel positive about the year. As for you readers, if you like me were dejected at this year and your mean score too took a huge dip, try Osake wa fuufu. It'll leave you with a smile. That's a promise.\\n\\n\r\nPhrase of the season: Shifukuuuuuuuun! \\n\\n\r\nP.S: Seriously guys, Chi-chan is best girl of 2017, no arguments. As well as Sora being husbando of 2017, if not the decade. But to be honest, Sora felt more and more like best Waifu material somewhere along the way too XD So anyway everyone, here's to a somewhat okay-ish 2017 and here's to a hopefully awesome 2018 especially the Spring season. On that note, this is my first review of this year, the first of many. Happy New Year everyone! Drink lots of Osake!",

Browsing through the shows I landed upon this one, and what I saw for 40 minutes, did not disappoint me.\r\nWhile others will disagree with me, I genuinely feel that Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara is one gem of an anime. A sweet take on the everyday life of a couple will make any depressed or grumpy guy happy.\r\nChistao is a working woman in a company. Pretty, reserved and excellent in her work. Sora, her husband, works in a bar. The anime dealswith Chi-chan being welcomed or treated to a drink by her husband everyday, and the cuteness that un-follows thereafter.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to think, not much to debate while watching the anime. Just kick back and relax as you see a cute couple still enjoying their days. It's an overall enjoying package and honestly for a 3 minute short with 13 episodes a critical part by part analysis seems foolish.\\n\\n\r\nChi-chan and Sora are really couple goals. Chisato is for sure my waifu of the season. Her drunk face, her serious face and her face filled with the love for her husband are too damn cute.

            "content": "Love is Like a Cocktail (AKA: Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara) represents everything that\u2019s I hate about the romance genre. Maybe you\u2019ll have more patience for it, but I\u2019m a pretty cynical person by nature so I struggled to not look at it spitefully. \r\nThe worst issues that plague this show:\r\n1. A man gives woman alcohol for the first time, now she\u2019s an alcoholic. (Great influence! Why not marry him!?!)\r\n2. She marries him to have a personal bartender. (a Hilariously misguided example of romance.)\r\n3. Guy buys his wife with alcohol. (There\u2019s more to love than just substance!)\r\n4. She becomes drunk very easily and throwsherself at him. (Wow nice life lessons!) \\n\r\n5. A \"romance\" starring adults is written with all the seriousness you'd expect of Umaru-chan. \\n\r\n(If you wanted to make a goofy romance, then alcohol-fueled relationships was not a good choice. It could have easily been a drama if they didn't approach a careful subject like alcoholism with so little care for the gentle subject.)\\n\\n\r\nYou can\u2019t teach an audience that a relationship works that way. Love doesn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t work like that. Alcohol doesn't work like that! When you\u2019re making an anime (watched mostly by kids or young adults) then it\u2019d probably be a good idea to consider your audience. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of this show\u2019s agregious issues it also fails to provide a decent watching experience. Despite being only 3 minutes long it is incredibly repetitive, each episode has the same sequence of events and it isn't funny or entertaining. The show has a simple but kind-hearted intentions that just don't come across at all. It wants to be cute and heartwarming but instead it borders on insulting. \\n\\n\r\nEvery episode a stressed-out businesswoman, Chisato, is comforted by her husband, Sora, with alcohol and/or food he prepares himself. Chisato and Sora have no chemistry, other than she likes the drinks that he makes and he likes feeding her. There is no spark between them. I wouldn't even believe that they were married if there wasn't an obligatory backstory episode. \\n\\n\r\nLove is Like a Cocktail is just a cooking show (and not a very good one at that) with a seemingly obligatory romance tacked on. Look no further than their undercooked relationship, there's no chemistry!\\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship is platonic at best, toxic at worse. No one should take their relationship seriously. This isn't what healthy romance looks like, it's poison and could never exist this happily in real life. Sure, if there were other qualities that Chisato and Sora loved each other for I could see it being more believable. But there are none. The show does not develop them past, a cute tired woman who likes alcohol, and a bartender who likes cute woman.\\n\r\nDanna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken this is not. \\n\\n\r\nStory 2/10 What story? +1 for a generously brief length.\\n\r\nArt 6/10 Fine. The food and drinks look\u2026 edible I guess? \\n\r\nSound 6/10 Nice ed. The voice acting is ok.\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10 +1 for the lemon.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10 The lemon was pretty funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3.0/10\\n\r\nIt's bad. Not just for short-form anime. It fails because it doesn't try to create a convincing romance or realistic characters, instead it just forces overbearing cuteness onto you. Maybe cute lady drinking alcohol is all you need for 3 minutes, but there should be something more.\\n\r\nPerhaps you may get some fleeting enjoyment from it if you are more tolerant to problematic disposable entertainment than I am. But for me 3 minutes a week is far too long to waste on this drivel.",

Even then, the lemon mascot (that shows up a lot) though he's expected character design for a mascot isn't that bad either. Either way the animation is pretty good if only because of the detailed cocktails.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting....well LA already said it but Eri Kitamura is MVP in this anime short if only because of her great transitioning between strict and focused office lady accenting to delightful drunk.\\n\\n\r\nOsake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara is FAR from being a horrible anime short, it's just merely a relationship of a husband and wife with alcohol involved and how they help each other from the worst or best of times and the alcohol in question is NOT brought up in a bad light and THAT is quite something even for an anime short.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you wanna see Eri Kitamura beergasm then Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara has your order.",

Unwinding with a bit of alcohol of course!\r\nThat's basically the gist of this little short called Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara. It's all about married couple Sora and Chisato enjoying their couple life by having Chi-chan get drunk.\r\nIt's a three minute short so you shouldn't expect much in the way of story, though the anime did surprise me by having, of all things, a two episode arc detailing the couple's first encounter. That was a nice touch the show decide to put at the end to give a bit more closure and also asa chance to have more cute moments with the two.\\n\r\nThe entire show is built around these cute moments. Nothing really matters aside from these. Well, maybe aside from the drink recipe you're shown in every episode. If you feel like it you could probably make these drinks on your own since they're really simple, I however haven't tried it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat else is there to say, really? The animation is below average, being mostly very still. The music may as well be non-existent and as mentioned above there's really no story to speak of.\\n\r\nWhat you see is what you get: a lovely, perfect couple and some drinks which make Chi-chan go all red and adorable.\\n\r\nI recommend watching this once a day, or once a week since it could get old watching what is essentially the same few story beats over and over again.\\n\r\nIf you do decide to give this anime a try you'll find a relaxing three minute show that will make you wish you had a wife like Chi-chan or a husband like Sora and maybe also a cold drink in hand.",

I realize they're not running on much of a budget but if you're going to make anime, then at least put some effort into it. After looking into the studio who created this anime, I can't say I'm surprised. Everything that they've created is bad. It has no soul, no creative passion. They just find as many web manga/4-koma manga, no matter the quality, to adapt. I fully admit that there are some redeemable things. The ed is good. Drunk moe girl iscute. But seriously mon, ask yourself, is that worth it? The characters are bland, uninspired, etc. It seems like they've been purposely created to make you viscerally go aww but really their relationship dynamics are nonsensical. The guy is a stay at home husband which is cool and everything because it's a twist from the way it usually is but this is literally the only point of his character. His only perceivable trait is that he is super nice, the perfect hubby. I feel like he is nothing but a wish fulfillment fantasy for women who have no idea what a relationship is like, let alone a marriage. Marriage is complicated and this show shows none of that. It's not even funny. In three words, it is bad.",

            "content": "Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte Kara: An entertaining series to have a good time\r\nAfter watching the 13 episodes of Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte Kara I must say that the series totally met my expectations. A good anime\r\nAs I have said many times, finding series whose protagonists are a couple is difficult and the issue is even more complicated if you are looking for a place where both are married. And I say really married, those contraptions of an arranged marriage (not consummated) where nobody wants to be; or that couple that is committed, but by third parties and in reality they do not feelanything, they do not strain anymore.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nEspecially since at the end of the day it is obvious that the intention of the authors is to \"get out\" of the clich\u00e9 of the epilogue couples by \"putting them together\" at the beginning; but in the end, however theoretically they may not be, in fact they are epilogue couples.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if we get into comedy, the matter is even worse because it is almost a rule that the couple is not together.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the premise is attractive. It is a couple where he is a master to make cocktails and she is an alcohol lover who gets super sweet when she gets drunk. A couple sent to do. In fact, they know each other when she went to have a drink at the bar where he works.\\n\\n\r\nObviously it is that dynamic of her being super serious and cutting when she is sober and super tender when drunk; and he is always looking for ways to make her drunk to enjoy his cuddly wife that moves the whole plot.\\n\\n\r\nIt is this premise that moves all this anime and as every series that shows a recurring pattern, there is always the risk that it ends up being boring for the repetitive. However, it is the variety of situations that give freshness to the couple's interactions.\\n\\n\r\nThere the manga shows that while you can find variety in the details, repeating the same structure is not a bad approach; and the anime knew how to capture that essence and capture it faithfully and impeccably in each of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAt a technical level it is not a series to highlight, the animation is regular, the design of characters too, the soundtrack does not have much to offer except the ending that lets itself be heard; and the management, although it was not extraordinary, has the merit of having found the ideal way to faithfully adapt the original material.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, a series that will not be in any top, but that is one of those different and interesting things offered by the season that has just ended. If you are looking for a light and entertaining comedy do not hesitate to give this series a try.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal rating\\n\\n\r\n6.5/10",

            "content": "We know that one can not demand much of an anime with time around 3 minutes per episode, but even an anime like that has to have criteria. As a development of a story, the characters, appropriate scenarios, moral of the story, techniques well used. Unfortunately this anime did not live up to expectations.\r\nThe story is about an alcoholic woman, in which she should produce comical or sexy moments after drinking. From the perspective of being an anime of short duration does not require a dense script, with deep dialogues, yet it does not comply with what is available. The scenes that should be sexyor comic do not construct dialogues or images that emphasize or convince this.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters are at their worst, the author seems to be bold in moments, but overall he is only committed to feminist, politically correct, and \"morally modern\" clich\u00e9s. There is an inversion in the amime of the roles of man and woman they occupy in society, which is bold, yet it does not seem to be so daring in the scenes when they demanded a little more female sexuality. The woman several times shoots, then cuts the scene and ends the anime frustrating who watches, but if they had a little bit of eechi maybe they could convince and even become funny.\\n\\n\r\nScenarios are limited, within what was expected, the picture quality, stroke rule, sharpness and focus are satisfactory. Although it does not have large fluid scenes, but it is within the proposed and without disappointment. If in other of the quests the anime sends badly at least in this one he is well, presenting / displaying no great error.\\n\\n\r\nWith regard to techniques what bothered was the sound. The male voice actor, Ichiki, Mitsuhiro of Sora was very annoying, and the lack of a soundtrack, of music, made all the difference to not transmit any emotion. In the other technical aspects no major problems were perceived.\\n\\n\r\nThe end of the anime, the last three episodes give an improvement, with finally some evolution in history. Despite being a flashback, there is the construction of a novel with a good development and repeating only in the last episodes. We can say that it is the only thing that really saves the anime and possibly also the lemon.\\n\\n\r\nSoon the anime if it is that we can call thus, does not have a satisfactory moral conclusion. It could be said that this is a bad taste of alcoholic drinks for women, in which the message is to marry a bartender, make him your domestic servant, and get drunk that he will love you. There is also the fact that the target audience is likely to be younger because it is an anime and without strong scenes that can not go on television at any time, even when there should be a better construction of the plot.\\n",

            "content": "This anime I want to say is nothing special but then I remember that is a complete lie. Time to read too much into a 39 min anime (closer to 33 from closing credits).\r\n1. Q: Are the characters lovable? \r\n    A: Absolutely! I've not seen much of this season to my own regret but I can still say this is one of the best couples I have seen in a long while. \r\nThe main couple is once married so instead of the classical cringe of them never admitting their love when it blatant here it is reminded they love one another everyepisode. \\n\\n\r\nThe greatest representation of this is when Sora comes down with a cold and Chi cooks for him. Her ability to do anything is shown to be horrendous but for her husband, she tries multiple time to get it right. \"Through sickness and in health\"\\n\\n\r\nEvery other episode is a representation of Sora's love for his wife, Chi. The greatest show of this is when Chi tries to go without alcohol for multiple days. He is shown to be depressed as her condition worsens from fatigue to where he makes a drink specifically to help her. After such, he is shown to be restless in bed without her as he stares at his clock seemingly counting the minutes without her.\\n\r\nLeaving bed he walks to her workroom to find her asleep on the computer the complete report beside her. With a smile, he picks her up and carries her to bed before kissing her and complimenting her. \"To love and to cherish\"\\n\\n\r\n2. Q: Did I enjoy the anime? \\n\r\n    A: Yes! It's very much an adult Himouto! Umaru-chan. Each episode gives you a different drink to try and to go along with diabetes from sugar overload. Maybe not that second part but it sure felt like it. Having now tried three of the twelve they've shown, egg shake, fake beer, and Irish coffee, they seemed to be pretty good. \\n\\n\r\n3. Q: What did I dislike about the anime?\\n\r\n    A: The length of the episodes, but I feel if they were longer the appeal of them would drop. The main part of this show really seems to be showing different types of drinks. In a thirty minute episodes and or a movie-style anime that feeling would be lost. \\n\\n\r\nWith each episode being short there aren't many changes in personality. That doesn't mean there isn't a story you can read into. I say this because there is a story that if you sit down and ignore the drinks you can love and enjoy.\\n\\n\r\n4. Q: Closing words? \\n\r\n    A: Much like everything else this isn't perfect nor is it for everyone. This is about two people who found their love for another from a fateful day of tripping and alcohol. A wife who feels she can only show herself when drunk and a husband who indulges her in said fantasy. It's three minutes each episode and I greatly suggest watching.",

            "content": "As someone who hates alcohol I found this show to be horrible and greatly disturbing. The show is all about a MAN constantly taking advantage of his SEX SLAVE (read as wife) by using DRUGS such as alcohol to loosen her inhibitions so he can RAPE her, EVERY NIGHT. Now our girl Chisato wasn't always a horrible drunk, but she was made that way by a MAN.\r\nThe origins of Chisato's alcoholism is revealed in a flashback later in the series. Back when she didn't have a crippling alcohol addiction, then everything changed when a MAN introduced her to alcohol as a fun thing to drink.He lured her in with a sweet alcoholic dessert then as the night went on he continued feeding her these sweet cocktails until she passes out drunk in the bar (I bet that MAN RAPED her while she was passed out). From that moment it is all down hill for Chisato as she is addicted to alcohol now and is all but forced to marry the MAN that started her addiction in the first place. He used alcohol to start her addiction and then using her FORCED addiction he continued to string her along with alcohol until she became his SEX SLAVE (read as wife) and sugar mommy so he wouldn't have to work (truly this show is nothing but RAPE CULTURE propaganda propped up by the PATRIARCHY).\\n\\n\r\nThese tragic events lead to the series proper in which each episode we see this STRONG INDEPENDENT WOMAN come home to her leach of a husband who feeds her alcohol until her inhibitions are loose enough that he can RAPE her. That is pretty much the story for every episode. The only saving grace of this anime is that it is so short.\\n\\n\r\nAt a merciful run time of 3 minutes every episode, which is thankfully cut even shorter by the 30 second outro of a fun little ending song with a cute lemon person riding a motorcycle (The only good part of the show in my opinion), I still cannot recommend this to anyone but pedophiles, racists and republicans, after all RAPE is still RAPE no matter how long it lasts. I really liked the little lemon person though so I am adding plus one to the overall rating of the show, and with that I give \"RAPE is like a FORCED ADDICTION\" a 2 out of 10 and a recommendation to skip it.",

Plus, the variety of drinks featured (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) provide an interesting educational angle. \r\nI will say, the implications of this story are a little disconcerting, as it appears that the wife is an obsessed alcoholic, though she wouldn't allow herself to be drunk in public if at all possible. Considering the target audience of the show, working adults who probably drink a lot anyway, the show does a very good job of presenting the maincouple as responsible adults who care for each other deeply, even if that is mostly implied rather than seen.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Short cute series for adults that are equal parts story and alcohol",

I just don't know much about their personalty beyond thator even anything about the supporting cast as well. With little comedy in each episode that kind of got a chuckle out me, the same setup and same joke in each episode makes it predictable and tiring to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was surprisingly good for a series with only a three minute run time per episode. It looks fine for what sets out to be with characters looking good and the drinks looking colorful and distinct. Yeah I'm not a person that likes alcohol that much but they were good to look at. As were the voice actors they were fine for what they given to do, though I was not a fan of the ending song. \\n\\n\r\nI have seen many short anime series with three to five minutes of content each episode such as this, some of have been great and some have been terrible, Love is like a cocktail falls right in the middle. Its not bad nor is it good, i just personally find it average, though I do wish that the relationship between the main characters was better explored in some of the episodes.

            "content": "Every now and then, you see one show in a season that no matter what other shows you watch it sticks in your mind, and slowly but surely it becomes your AOTS, or Anime of the Season. Osake wa fuufu ni natte Kara is my AOTS for Fall 2017, easily edging out Urahara and more importantly edging out fan favorite Shokugeki no Souma's third season. How? How did such a small and less known (in comparison) title beat out Shokugeki? Read on and find out.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nBeing my first entry to the \"short anime\" sub-genre, I felt quite irritated at first that a show was just3 minutes per episode and thought it wouldn't be able to pull it off. Boy was I wrong. The central theme of Osake wa Fuufu was Alcohol, no prizes for guessing, but it wasn't just alcohol, no no, if that was true it would never have beaten Shokugeki (I'm bringing it up constantly since it's also a show having to do with a consumable, food compared to Osake which is also focused on a consumable, alcohol). What made it superior was the relationship between the characters, their interactions, the brilliant way the anime showed how alcohol takes it's place in different times of the day and at different situations. There was no central plot, but there was alcohol, and there certainly was a lot of cute moments WHICH by the way, were totally still related to alcohol. The most amazing thing with the anime was that Alcohol became the story, the plot. Coupled with the fact that it marvelously mixed alcohol with every other aspect of the anime, I give it a standing ovation. If only it had been longer, if it were a full length anime I'd happily award it a 9, no joke.\\n\\n\r\nWord of the paragraph: Alcohol\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was a wonder to watch. Since it was based on booze, the booze HAD to look good, and it looked damn mouthwatering. One of the wierdest points I felt in a good way about the anime was that the art, especially the alcohol looked oddly satisfying. Character designs were different from the generic style in the way that the colors were way more rich (like a good glass of bourbon) and what was the cherry on top of the wine was how cute they looked. Chi-chan could easily be my favorite character design in the WHOLE of 2017. Not exaggerating. More praise coming in the character part. To end the art section here, it was as mentioned before: Oddly Satisfying. 'Nuff said.\\n\\n\r\nWord of the paragraph: Booze\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom the cute and perfect Seiyuus to the addicting ending song to the sound the liquor made when it was poured into the glass, the sound section was amazing and easily one of the best parts of the anime. Chi-chan was adorable (wait for the character section for more), Sora too sounded like the perfect husbando and the other supporting cast also sounded very much like real adults just going out for a drink. The way the VAs made adult drinking life sound so relatable to adults was a huge help in bumping that score up to a whopping 9. A standing ovation from me for sure.\\n\\n\r\nWord of the paragraph: Liquor\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEasily my favorite part of the show, the characters were beautiful, both by looks and personality. Chi-chan was so perfectly and so realistically done I can name her my Waifu of 2017 in just a heartbeat, NO OTHER CHARACTER came EVEN CLOSE to her quality. Why? Relatability, the \"moe\" effect, heck, even spirits helped her boost her appeal in my eyes to that of \"Waifu of the year\" (though I'd prefer calling it \"Best female character of the year\"). You might think the male's side won't have the spotlight, well you're wrong, Sora ALSO takes the top cake as \"Husbando of the year\" (once again, I prefer it to be called \"Best make character of the year\"), why? He's perfect! He's charming, he can cook, but most importantly, HE CAN MAKE THE BEST ETHANOL. Not just that, a later episode also shows the backstory of how they met, why an I mentioning this? To prove that this anime isn't all ethanol everywhere (although admittedly you won't be wrong if you guessed alcohol snuck everywhere too). \\n\\n\r\nAfter almost a paragraph of praise you look at that score of 8 and look at me confused. Why 8? Why so much praise then? Well, some of you might have noticed that I haven't talked about the supporting cast at all. Sadly this was the problem this anime faced. Being a short anime, it couldn't focus on the supporting cast at all... They were shown at some points but looking for the impact they made is like looking for a needle in a haystack... The supporting cast was barely shown and you might bring up the excuse saying \"but Osake focuses only on Chi-chan and Sora\" to which I say then why bring up the supporting cast AT ALL then? If you show them once, make them appear frequently if you can't develop them. That at least would be enough to make me give this a perfect score... But to end in a good note, Chi-chan and Sora alone handled it all by themself, if the supporting cast disappointed me, the main cast FAR exceeded my expectations. Both of them won my Character of the Year. That's enough to make me happy.\\n\\n\r\nWord of the paragraph: Ethanol\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nA 10? What?! How? An anime about intoxicating drinks got a 10/10 from a non-alcoholic drinker? Impossible? Baka-nano! This wasn't according to keikaku?! This is all I expect from you to say (minus the last one). Well, what can I say. I loved every bit of this anime. The characters were my favorite part of Osake wa Fuufu. Chi-chan and Sora gave me diabetes from sugary moments. To say that Osake Fuufu had a lot of sweet moments is a gross understatement. It was like I said, DIABETES worth of sweetness. Couple goals, sweet, relatable, making-you-jealous-of-being-lonely, an anime that restores your faith in humanity. All this is what I and many other watchers felt from watching Osake Fuufu. And this was just on the surface of the cake, if I went beyond I wouldn't be able to end this review and would likely hit the supposed character limit for a MAL review. I have yet to decide on my AOTY but I doubt Osake won't make the Top 5, if not the top 3.\\n\\n\r\nWord of the paragraph: Intoxicant\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.2 (Averaged)\\n\\n\r\nOverall Osake Fuufu is an anime that surpasses most full length anime, even though it had a measly 3 minutes on hand. It didn't waste those 3 minutes on pointless filler, beach episodes, hanabi festivals. It used up it's weapons very wisely and didn't waste them away. It was centered on Sake. But what was arguably better was how well the main characters were presented; Sora and Chi-chan. I've seen some good female characters over the years, and very less even moderately decent male characters. I felt this year was vastly inferior to the past years (my mean score chart took a huge dip from the previous years and 2017 is my lowest rated year in THIRTEEN YEARS, since 2004. I didn't expect much from Osake. But what Osake did was shatter ALL of this, it gave me 2017's best female character, it gave me 2017's best male character, and though it couldn't do much to keep this year's mean up, it certainly gave me something to feel positive about 2017. It made me end my anime year on a good note. Arigatou Osake wa fuufu ni natte Kara for making me feel positive about the year. As for you readers, if you like me were dejected at this year and your mean score too took a huge dip, try Osake wa fuufu. It'll leave you with a smile. That's a promise.\\n\\n\r\nPhrase of the season: Shifukuuuuuuuun! \\n\\n\r\nP.S: Seriously guys, Chi-chan is best girl of 2017, no arguments. As well as Sora being husbando of 2017, if not the decade. But to be honest, Sora felt more and more like best Waifu material somewhere along the way too XD So anyway everyone, here's to a somewhat okay-ish 2017 and here's to a hopefully awesome 2018 especially the Spring season. On that note, this is my first review of this year, the first of many. Happy New Year everyone! Drink lots of Osake!",

            "content": "It's an anime about love, alcohol, and a relationship that every weeb wishes they could get. That's about it. \r\nStory: 7\r\nWoman experiences life's daily struggles. Guy makes an alcoholic drink. Woman drinks said alcohol. Then comes... Love? Bliss? Glee? I'm sure it's one of those. While every episode typically follows this formula, because of the short length and small variables within each episode, you won't feel like it gets old. Other than that, there isn't a story. Normally, that would get points taken off, but this is one of the few anime that doesn't require an overarching plot.\r\nHowever, they did give two episodes dedicated tothe backstory of our main characters. In all honesty, they could have done much less.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nIt's clear that there was a budget here, even if it was small. There isn't much \"animation\" to speak of, but the artwork itself is vibrant and keeps your attention. You can see that there were a few cut corners, but you'd have to look for them to actually notice. Overall, there is at least some effort put into the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nI don't think that an anime about a woman getting drunk actually needs a soundtrack. Clearly, the creators knew this as other than a few sound effects, there isn't any distinct music. Luckily, the voice acting is good, and the ending theme is, while odd for this series, is relatively catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThere are only 2 characters worth mentioning, Chisato (otherwise known as Chi-chan), the wife, and Sora, the husband. \\n\r\nChi-chan is a alcohol loving, and caring wife. However, they didn't just leave it at that. It is clearly defined that she is self-conscious about her drinking habits. Frankly, it's not much, but it's all she needed.\\n\r\nSora is the caring husband. While he loves making all kinds of food and exotic drinks, he loves his wife even more. Even if he is pre-occupied with something else, he always finds time to treat his wife with his drinks.\\n\r\nYou could compare the characters here to almost any other anime and see that there isn't too much development here, but it gets the job done. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nYou see a woman become drunk and then proceed to become adorable. Do we have to ask for more?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nWhile I don't think anybody on this site falls under the demographic this anime was aiming for, even I found some enjoyment out of it. While I don't think I would've watched it normally, because of the lack of other things to watch this fall, I resorted to this. Honestly, I don't regret it. Even if it is lackluster in some aspects, the creators cared enough to realize that this show deserved effort to be put into it. Thus, they did.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have nothing else to watch, then give this a try.\\n",

However, the plot does somewhat become repetitive if you're binge watching this series, so my advice is to watch in whilst taking a few breaks (even though it's 3 minutes each episode). This anime did help me get some amazing alcoholic and non-alcoholic recipes that I would want to try out in the future. All in all, my only gripes with this anime is how the formatof the plot will become a little bit repetitive but I still liked it.\\n",

Yum. There's even a small community of fans dedicated to replicating the recipes from this anime (with varying results of success) that can be found on youtube and various blogs across theinternet. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t care for alcohol then perhaps you'd be interested in the perverted pandering of a thicc blonde getting wasted every episode in the company of her husband. Chisato is a stoic businesswoman by day and a sloppy drunk by night that makes a barrage of cute faces and puts her body in compromising positions. Unfortunately for viewers with lewd expectations, Chisato's husband Sora displays a level of self restraint that would put a nun to shame, denying every single physical advance of his extremely sexy wife while she is under the influence of alcohol. As a self professed ecchi degenerate this was very annoying. Cocktease cocktail could be an alternative title.\\n\\n\r\nIt's rare that you'll find an anime (let alone a short) that'll teach you something informative that can be put to good use recreationally, and for that reason this anime is worth checking out even if the fanservice is rather lackluster.",

Realistically, in the time it takes to read this review, you could have probably watched 2 episodes and decided for yourself if it's worth watching or not, but I digress.\r\nThe story's centred around a newly married couple - Chisato, a hard-working and attractive OL at her company, who is comically weak to alcohol, with a single drink enough to make her drunker than an Irishman on a Tuesday afternoon. Her husband, Sora, is a bartender, with profound knowledge of many different drinks, the recipes of which are displayed on-screen for what reason I donot know, I don't think anyone paused and made themselves a cocktail in the middle of watching. Each episode is usually about 3 minutes long so there really isn't much time for anything particular to happen. Every episode goes as follows\\n\\n\r\n-Chitose working\\n\r\n-Chitose comes home\\n\r\n-Chitose drinks\\n\r\n-She becomes unable to control herself and gets close and personal with Sora\\n\r\n-Sora comforts her\\n\r\n-Episode ends\\n\\n\r\nI really don't have a great deal to say about this show, and that's largely due to the fact I don't have a great deal to work with.

That being said, this is very cute seinen short about a salary woman decompressing after her hard work days with her stay at home-ish kawaii af husband who is great at making drinks. I don't really make drinks myself but I must say this show has enticed me to start trying as they make themseem very simple and delicious! Nothing really extraordinary about the show as it's just a short and isn't trying to do anything spectacular other than show you some alcoholic beverages and a cute married couples relationship.",

Most would think that the highlight of every episode is the formula of the drinks that each episode features, but for me, its how the main couple show their affection and how you can see how much they care for and love each other in every episode thru their simple words and gestures - yes, their sweet nothings. It's good to see characters who are very much comfortable in showing and telling how they feel that is whyI really find this anime very light and refreshing to watch. After watching this, you would really start to dream of having that kind of relationship in real life when you get married.",

I'm still trying to wrap my head around the idea that this is actually an anime. The barely existent story is about as flavourless as could possibly be, and is extremely repetitive. The exact same thing happens every single episode. Why did I watch all 13 episodes, I'm still asking myself that.  If you want to getsome new drink recipes I would recommend this to you but if you want to watch an actual anime and not a commercial, I'd look elsewhere.",

In short, this anime isn't very good.\r\nThe background info you need is a business woman named Chisato and a bartender named Sora are married. Each episode has a starting scene but it always ends up the same. Wife comes home from work, is handed a drink of some kind. She becomes drunk which makes her more bubbly and bright as a character.\r\nAs for enjoyment, its really lacking. I don't think this is some bad example for children like some others. However it is boring, repetitive, and trying too hard to becute. Each episode is the exact same with a new drink. Wife comes home and has her glasses on and hair pulled back. Drinks the drink of the day and then takes her glasses off, lets her hair down and pulls a cute face. For some reason they also list out some of the ingredients for the drink as if we will make it at home, or care for that information. \\n\\n\r\nI think they were trying to capture the essence Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken, which is actually a good show imo. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Boring and repetitive. Not even worth the 3 minutes to see a single episode.",

The characters are very simple, and the \"plot\" is straightforward. The protagonist is self-conscious about her drinking, thus she only drinks around her husband at home who is a former bartender.\r\nThe main couple were the only ones with any real development, but each episode seemed to mostly boil down to the drink served for a particular mood the protagonist was feeling. The show was admittedly pretty cute, however Ikept wondering for what reason I was going forward. There wasn't anything poor about the animation, art, or sounds, however the series doesn't have a lot of depth. The first episodes feel largely the same as the last, and when I compare that to something like Akkun no Kanojo (currently airing as of this review), I can't help but feeling I wanted more out of the show.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, if you're looking for a show you can knock out in an afternoon with some cute characters, interesting drinks, and you don't mind a bit of mediocrity: it can fill your spot of extra anime you've been meaning to get to.",
