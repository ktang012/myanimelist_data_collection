            "content": "It's difficult to produce a shoujo romance that doesn't feel rushed, especially within that 12 episode time crunch. With shoujo romances I like to see a nice a steady progression between the two soon to be flowering pairings. That's that's exactly what I got with Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou - it's a shoujo that's not rushed. However it ends at the climax - and without a second season to wrap everything up, the first season is quite pointless.\r\nThe story follows a high-schooler named Kazunari Usa as he moves into a boarding house complex, illustrating the unique blossoming relationship he has with fellow roommate, Ritsu Kawai.On top of that we see the connections Kazunari develops as a result from meeting his roommates. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound is an area where I find this anime excels in. The sound is perfect; everything from the pedalling of the bikes to the rustling of the bed sheets when someone wakes up is heard, it\u2019s all there. The art is quite special as well, the colours are vibrant and pleasing to the eyes. I urge everyone who has not seen this series yet to download this series, do not steam this anime. Even if you are not a downloader, just download the first episode and compare the quality to that of streaming, you will enjoy and appreciate the art more and find the anime more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharm and loveable characters are very difficult to radiate in an anime, specifically when we get to see a board spectrum of personalities from shy-introvert Ritsu to unusual/creepy Shirosaki to dysfunctional Mayumi. Even with that said everyone in this anime unusually interacts in harmony with each other, and I'm sure you will find someone from this anime that will gravitate towards you. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character development, we have Ritsu as our pupil. Her development is based off the main plot of this anime, which is flowering relationship between herself and Kazunari. If I were to use the caterpillar, cocoon, butterfly analogy; I would say that Ritsu evolved from a caterpillar to a cocoon by the end of the series (watch the anime and you'll understand what I mean). Which I find perfect because it just makes the concept of love more authentic and leaves an air of mystery for the audience for what's anticipated if a sequel is produced. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this anime surprised me in a good way, I was going into this series expecting two people to eventually fall in love, confess to each other and by the end have their first kiss and that would be the end of this anime; just like and typical romantic comedy. To my surprise, it was the complete opposite of what I thought, you will have to watch and see I don\u2019t want to spoil it! I will add, if you're into witty humour and stereotypical iterations between characters in a romantic comedy, this anime is right up your alley. However, if you're the type who just wants an rom-com anime where the main characters profess their love interests to each other, then you should not watch this until a sequel comes out.\\n\\n\r\nLove in real life takes time and work, it doesn\u2019t happen as soon as most romance anime depict it to be. It's refreshing to see that within a short anime, the important aspects of love is not crunched into 12 episodes. Overall I loved this anime and have absolutely no complaints, if you want an authentic romance anime with some witty comedy, I\u2019d suggest you watch Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou. It just needs a second season to finalize everything. \\n",

            "content": "If you\u2019ve attended school before, chances are that you\u2019ve gone to a library once whether it\u2019s for studying, research, reading a good book, or just hanging out with a friend. Not unless like you\u2019re Kazunari Usa of course, who happens to wander into the school library not by a chance to dig into a good book but rather seeing a cute girl deep in her thoughts. Seemingly set by destiny and fate, we later learn that Usa also (again by chance) happens to share the same dormitory of this girl. Her name is Ritsu Kawai and here is the enchanting story between these two charactersof your normal life. \\n\\n\r\nBokura wa Minna Kawaisou (aka as The Kawai Complex Guide to Manors and Hostel Behavior) based off the manga of the same name is animated by Brain Base. Coming from the premise, one should expect this to be a normal slice of life show. But what begin during the first episode isn\u2019t as very typical as Usa encounter a local pervert named Shirosaki. Also perhaps labeling himself as a masochist, his meeting with Usa almost has him arrested. It\u2019s a classic and inspires laughter given how much of a contrast characters with such an introductory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is simple and straightforward but shouldn\u2019t be labeled as romance tale. Sure, we have the nice guy (Usa) meeting stoic Ritsu alone in a quiet school setting. To add to the topping, we get a clear idea that Usa falls in love with her at first sight. There\u2019s no clear word to describe the circumstance or what illustrate such feeling as it\u2019s pure and natural human instinct. At the same time, there\u2019s innocence as Usa\u2019s feelings seems to be honest, sincere, and at times childish. Perhaps the rest is because Usa\u2019s desire to explore the world by himself after moving out of his family\u2019s house for the first time. The catch is that Ritsu is a polar opposite of his character. Whether he likes it or not, Ritsu is in love with books rather than seeking out a boyfriend or future husband. This sets a rather peculiar instance as Usa tries to appeal to her. But looking at it from a clear angle, we notice Ritsu as a character with resilience, a girl with innate sense for literature, and difficult to articulate a conversation with. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean Usa should give him and throw it all away because his chance with Ritsu is always at hand when they share the same dorm. The problem? Some of the other characters\u2019 interference and even Usa\u2019s self-worth. And while the story initially sets up of what viewers may expect, the series hardly explores romance from a dynamic angle. The \u201cwill they or not\u201d isn\u2019t really a question that has answers so your patience will not be rewarded.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up easily, Usa isn\u2019t exactly an appealing main character. He is just too nice and plain for a guy. And like normal guys, he fantasizes about girls in particularly Ritsu. His initial introduction shows him staring at her for several minutes in awe of her beauty and figure. It doesn\u2019t stop there as he often deludes himself from reality and formulates various fantasies involving him and her in some sort of deceptive dreamland. Usa\u2019s dream turns into disfigured when he realizes the lack of attention Ritsu pays to him. Its\u2019 a rather hard counter to his desire but guys like him always try, try, and\u2026try. And tries he does on many opportunities but the results aren\u2019t always favorable. He isn\u2019t exactly an opportunist and takes advantage of a certain situation though. Rather, he is honest and genuinely wants to get to know Ritsu and hopefully climb out of the friend zone. But most times, their relationship seems to be one sided. Being the bookworm that she is, Ritsu is in a fantasy world of her own surrounded by the imaginative ideas of literature while Usa is hopelessly chasing after her like a puppy in love. Throughout the show though, there are times when Ritsu realizes reality and appreciates Usa\u2019s efforts. She sees him as an honest man who is always willing to lend a helping hand when she\u2019s in trouble. These often extend to aiding her with a task, sticking up to her against others, and settling against her worst fears. To express sincerity, she says simple gratitudes such as \u201cThank You\u201d and sometimes apologizes when she feels something she has done isn\u2019t right. While this isn\u2019t exactly a confession, it appeals to Usa\u2019s confidence and makes him feel appreciative for his actions. It\u2019s innocent, charming, and strikes out as what friends do for each other. Yes, it doesn\u2019t qualify as a love story but it\u2019s delightful to find how such contrasting characters can get along in the same place, the Kawai Complex.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, there are other residents there as well. And if you thought either Usa or Ritsu might be hard to get used to, then these characters will strike out as complete oddballs. From minute one they enter the story, it\u2019s easy to see just how different they are. We have Sumiko, the dorm manager. As the oldest member of the dorm, she speaks with wisdom but also strikes fear into others with her sarcastic tone of voice when she\u2019s in a bad mood. Being old doesn\u2019t make her frail at all but instead presents Sumiko as a grandma to be respected. The remaining three members of the dorm includes the pervert Shirosaki whom he met before, Mayumi, and Sakaya. The latter two are lovely ladies with the looks and charm. However, they fall under the stereotypical frenzy of college girls. Everything in their mind is about dating guys and partying. This is especially true for Mayumi who is known to dating the typical \u201cbad boys\u201d and having terrible luck with men in general. For Sayaka, she comes off as a mischievous troublemaker. Unfortunately, almost all the dorm members becomes a subject of her trickery at some points throughout the story. In particular with Mayumi, she pours out her endearing \u201cfeelings\u201d to the point where some might mistake her as a lesbian. It\u2019s all fun and jokes but the show itself sometimes feels far too forceful to accompany these ideas. Some of the jokes could even be labeled as a fetish whether it\u2019s Ritsu\u2019s obsession for books, Mayumi\u2019s desire to date men, or Shirosaki\u2019s obvious masochism. Yet despite this, the show obviously makes fun of itself and appeals to life in more of a recreational form. Rather than focusing on deep relationships or often dealing with complicated drama, the show settles for a quiet atmosphere with ironic doses of energy. It successfully pulls it off without being dull with this cherry energy and credible realism. Every episode offers something new that explores real life concepts with tastes of eccentricity. A major focus on the show also deals with youth, a reason why Usa moves out of his former home and into the Kawai complex to build a new life. We see how his life progresses with these characters, and although they are depicted as uncanny in some ways can be attractive with their own appeals. \\n\\n\r\nAs the show often likes to have fun with itself, expect plenty of comedy. The word plays and gags are all over the place including its dialogues and references. The personalities of the main characters often pokes fun of itself as well with every given opportunity. Usa, perhaps the most normal resident of the Kawai dorm, often compromises himself with situations that seems to draw unwanted attention. The trollish moments Sayaka plays off and Ritsu\u2019s responses to what\u2019s around are also noticeable. Even Shirosaki gets some attention with the surprising attention of a puppy love crush from a younger character. All these are called a journey towards youth through experience, just like how Usa is living his newfound life. \\n\\n\r\nEssentially, the artwork will probably stand out more as a an appealing technical factor of the show. The way it presents itself feels like a dreamscape with its decorative coloring. The Makoto Shinkai vibe may hit home with its artistic visuals that is glimmering with shimmers. Texts are often incorporated to enhance the experience of youth because people likes to explore ideas, and words are a centerpiece of that. Plus, the humor it brings out is charming. Character designs are also created to illustrate how diverse they are. However, some of them are designed to look stereotypical such as Sayaka\u2019s college girl look with makeup aesthetics or Mayumi\u2019s \u201cmature\u201d body. Usa hardly stands out with anything memorable about him and while Ritsu has charm with appearance, her personality can feel dull. However, her charm can come out explicitly when she\u2019s wearing something decorative or putting on her innocent smile with sincere gesture. On another note, the Kawai Complex dorm looks normal without any glamorous features. It looks more traditional like one of those Japanese inns you\u2019d visit during vacation. What it does have though is a girls\u2019 section where Ritsu\u2019s handy dandy kendo stick lies in wait for daring members of the opposite sex\u2026\\n\\n\r\nCredit to the soundtrack can be given based on two dynamics \u2013 the characters\u2019 voices which enhances their image and the OP song which is well coordinated with imaginative coordination. For voice portrayals, Ritsu\u2019s soft tone comes from the talents of Kana Hanazawa, well known for her work with similar characters. Mayumi and Sumiko also gets some credit for their voices to fit their characters whether they can be sarcastic or intimidating. On the other hand, Usa\u2019s voice is dull as a rock while Sayaka has the mannerism of a fourth grader. Technical wise, the OST is moderate with some moments that are memorable when the capture the expressive responses of the characters or situation. Other times, it almost feels like it\u2019s not even there.\\n\\n\r\nTake this show as a story of boyhood and girlhood. We get a diverse cast of characters in a simple story, rather than multitude layers of love polygons. It\u2019s set in a normal setting without any explicit violence or sex. And despite some of the generic gags going on, the show is a fun experience for its energy. Don\u2019t expect relationships to develop in ways that tell a Cinderella love story. Rather, the show tells stories about youth and growing up with others who are so different. In the Kawai Complex, that\u2019s something to be thankful for.\\n",

            "content": "Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is a good light romantic and little comedy themed anime. The story is very unoriginal, stereotypical and blatant. Nonetheless it's a good romance anime that people can enjoy watching, get a good giggle out of, and feel happy about. Of course, I love almost all romance anime, so if you don't like romance anime, then this anime probably isn't going to be that appealing to you.\r\nAnyways, the plot is very simple. It's about a high school freshman, Kazunari Usa who movies into a boarding house and it turns out that the love of his life, Ritsu Kawai is living there too.The story focuses on the development of the relationship between these two. Basically Ritsu loves books (a little too much), and is easily bothered/annoyed with other people, especially those that talk too much. She really doesn't show any kind of emotion towards other people, and doesn't show any sign of \"love\" towards Usa. Usa basically tries everything he has to get Ritsu to notice him, but sort of fails due to his shyness. But that's where the other fun characters who also live in the same boarding complex come into play! Mayumi Nishikino, a psychopathic, lazy, inappropriate, and drunk lady who loves to make fun of Usa for liking Ritsu, says mean things in front to Usa, but in the bigger picture, is always helping/protecting Usa. Then there's Shirosaki, a perverted masochist, whom I always pictured as a godlike figure in the anime, hehe. That's because although he acts dumb and useless, he's actually quite perceptive and awfully helpful in many ways. And last but not least, Sayaka Watanabe, a \"pretty\" girl who is actually a slut. Pretty funny character though, especially her relationship to Mayumi. All the side characters add  excitement, comedy, and enjoyment to the whole, rather slow love relationship between Usa & Ritsu.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in music in the anime were mediocre, nothing that stands out particularly. But the opening was nice to listen to; I watched/listened to the opening every episode. The voicing didn't disappoint either, each character's voice fit their personalities. The art was very lively and colorful. Very beautiful city, with beautifully drawn characters, I loved Usa and Ritsu's green hair ^o^! \\n\\n\r\nIf you like romance comedies, then this anime is one that you might want to check out. I really enjoyed it despite it's obvious, unoriginal plot. Kind of a relaxing anime, that isn't very serious, and there's absolutely nothing scary or confusing about the anime. Such a cute and sort of innocent anime!",

            "content": "Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is probably one of the top comedy animes of 2014. its a good romantic comedy, slice of life anime that will keep you wanting more at the end of every episode.\r\nthe story begins with Kazunari Usa, a high school 1st year who ends up living in a boarding house due to his parents working overseas. he finds out that the girl of his dreams Kawai Ritsu, also lives in the same complex, but just when he think things are looking up,he soon realizes that his other roommates are anything but normal.\r\nThe animation for Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is rather average, nothingreally sticks out as good or bad. But it looks very good. I definitely applaud the character designs, they are very well-done.\\n\\n\r\nthe characters in this anime are all really different and each have unique stories. The characters are the main focus of the show with Kazunari Usa, being your average romcom anime herione that is always too nice at times and is easy to fall in love. another main character of the anime , Kawai Ritsu, is a 2nd year high school student that spends most of her time reading books and is alone most of the time , who is also very shy and can be quite cold sometimes. Of course you have to deal with stereotypes for the most part, but they are overall a good relatable cast, which have their flaws and never feel too one sided.It's also funny how characters become more likable the further the show progresses. It is evidence of character progression.\\n\\n\r\nas for the music and sound of the anime, it is nothing out of the ordinary Exepct the fact that Kana Hanazawa is the voice actor for one of the main character Kawai Ritsu, which makes the anime even better.\\n\\n\r\noverall i think this anime has a little bit of everything school, comedy , romance and slice of life. The romance was a downer, but that was just a small part of the story so it didn't take away from the overall enjoyment. To this day, I still hope will get a second season, because it deserves one. If you're looking for an anime show with great characters,tons of comedic parts and a solid story line with a mixture of light-hearted and serious moments, then this a good watch. I was very satisfied with this, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",

While it could've been a promising anime, in reality its another anime that doesn't know what it really wants to show and if does something, its usually bad executed. \r\nThe story is nothing special, or why would i give it a 5? You know when there are so many ways to make an interesting plot, anime such as this only put it simple from the very first episode and theres no further developing.\r\nThe Art. Well, i don't see anything awe inspiring, moving on.\r\nThe Sound is forgettable and as mediocre as this anime in general. Can't remember a single track.\r\nCharacters. Now thisis where it is going very dull. Main character is your average Joe that wants to spend his high school days with a girl and thats his only motive. No back story, no charisma whatsoever. The girl, Ritsu, is never developed fully and is just an unlikeable character. The crazy guy Shirosaki is just driving nuts considering he is plain stupid.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the romantic aspect of this anime could be called a relationship, the comedy aspect however is not there. Simply put, the humor is missing. I didn't laugh a single time, not because i don't like comedy, but because this anime and such try to much to inlcude an uninspired humor that only mentally ill people would appreciate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBokura wa Minna Kawaisou is one of the millions upon millions of average shows that hide the real treasures of anime.",

            "content": "'Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou' (aka: 'The Kawai Complex Guide to Manors and Hostel Behavior') is a rather unoriginal anime... in presence at least. Unoriginality though, does not automatically equal 'plain', 'unappealing', or 'bland'. It could very easily, but this show manages to take many things that you're probably familiar with (or maybe even tired of) in the anime-world and present them in a fun, simple way. \r\nStory - 8/10\r\nAs MAL's synopsis covers the show's general plot-line well, I won't reiterate it here. You've seen this kind of setup all over the anime-community. Boy strikes out to 'live alone' and encounters some kind of problem, usuallycomedic or romantic (or both). But, who doesn't like to see something you're used to done again, so long as a fresh spin is taken and originality (as much as is possible within the limited setting such as this) shines through. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is primarily a slice-of-life, comedy and romance. The romance is light and sweet, and the comedy is flamboyant - as it should be in a show such as this. You will definitely laugh and, if romance is something you enjoy, probably swoon. The story is never dull, and also not too flashy or dramatic. As such, the story is very enjoyable and flows well. Though, when the story ends, it just... ends, with no real conclusion (typical of this genre), so watch out for that. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis part will be subjective from person-to-person. But to me, the art was very solid. The somewhat realistic look of the anime was a nice touch. Of course, typical anime flourishes are here: 'oh crap' looks, variations on chibi-like character models for funny moments, words beside the character, giving hilarious looks into the characters mind and feelings of that instant. It meshes well together, the 'funny animation' and 'normal animation'. \\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, everything was nice. No jarringly bad moments - consistency was kept across the whole series - and colors are bright and vivid.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyu all did a great job, though nothing that stands out from any other anime with great voice-work. The music is light and and works with the scenes portrayed and the mood that has been set at the time. No stand out tracks though, aside from the opening and ending themes which, depending on your tastes, could be catchy and fun. They were to me at least.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you read the synopsis, then you have a pretty good idea of what you're dealing with here. For those that didn't, allow me to expand and explain on them (those who did, just skip this part if you want)... \\n\\n\r\nYou have (all tenants of the 'Kawai Complex'):\\n\\n\r\nShirosaki; the masochistic and perverted tenant. The unique thing though, is that there's also a lot more to him: wisdom and compassion. He is actually a deep character, though not that deep, the perverts in anime (almost) never are... \\n\\n\r\nSayaka; The tease, the flirt, especially with males her age (or, heck, any age). Also, the 'frenemy' of Mayumi (who I will get to next). This woman is insane, in the fun-to-watch way.\\n\\n\r\nMayumi; The drunkard, well-endowed office lady with horrible luck concerning men. She loves to meddle and tease, though is nowhere near as sadistic as Sayaka, who she often fights with. When she and Sayaka go at it, hilarity ensues. \\n\\n\r\nSumiko; Ritsu's great aunt and the manager of 'Kawai Complex'. Usually kind and soft-spoken - but, don't disobey the complex's rules or shame the name of the residency with your actions... or else the other side of her will appear. A side far scarier than Sayaka at her worst. Even Sayaka retreats when Sumiko gets ticked off.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, we have the main two: 'Usa' and 'Ritsu'.\\n\\n\r\nUsa; Our main character. Your typical nice guy that's infatuated with a girl. He has a few quirks, but he's not terribly unique. The girl he's infatuated with though - Ritsu - is an interesting character, even if she's a bit cliche...\\n\\n\r\nRitsu; An EXTREME bookworm, to the point of obsession - though it's played off comically. She is shy and reserved, preferring to read rather than socialize for the most part. But once you get to know her, it becomes evident that there's a wealth of personality under that shell of hers. She is a blast to watch when she starts breaking that shell. That is when she shines as a character.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these characters are cliche in many ways, but also unique. At the very least, you'll enjoy some of them. Their interactions with each other are the threads that hold this show together.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis series is easily enjoyable. Some moments may be slightly bland or lackluster, but they are rare. For the most part, you will be constantly entertained and presented with a nice amount of comedy and innocent romance. After all, that's what slice-of-life romance/comedies are supposed to do, and this one does it pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 'Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou' is a nice little slice-of-life series with a romance-comedy vibe. If you are a fan of this genre, then just jump in headfirst and enjoy; you're not likely to be disappointed. And for those on the fence, give it a shot, who knows, you just might enjoy it!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It's cute, and funny romance series.\r\nStory 7: The main plot of the story is a normal highshool boy goes off to live on his own at the \"Kawai Complex\" where it is filled with bunch of, I suppose, \"unique\" people.  He has a huge crush on one of the residents there, who is his senpai that LOVES to read books.  Although I'm not a big fan of the female character being older, I guess this is a exception.  \r\nArt 9: I think theart is really nice.  It's really colorful and matches with the series.  I especially love the close up of the eyes, which I think the art is well drawn. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7: The opening and the ending for the show is cute, and fits in very well with the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9: Oh my god.  The characters are perfect.  Thats all I can basically say.  Each character has a unique personality, and they all fit in very well.  I think the characters are what makes the series really enjoyable and funny.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9:  I really enjoy this anime, it always cheers me up :)  Like I said earlier, it is one of the best series of the season.  It is so cute and funny, I love it XD\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9: If you're really into lighthearted romantic comedies, you should totally watch this :D and I'm really new to this site so sorry if my review sucked...",

            "content": "***My robot friend in the robot highschool***\r\nIt appears that the clever people at the anime industry have finally found the holy grail of directing, a formula that guarantees positive reception regardless of the condition of the industry or the viewers - namely take the latest trends and do an exact reverse. For lack of better terms let's name this new brand of psychological engineering as \"anti-trend\".\r\n***Two day old coyote. Better than three day old coyote***\r\nIt's really dead simple as that. Observe recent cliches and flip them upside down:\r\nCute love interest inexplicably infatuated with a boring protagonist? Turn her into a boyish cold fish completly uniterestedin romance.\\n\r\nPlain boy becoming strangely successful in his highschool romance? Make him completly oblivious to reality and even more plain.\\n\r\nBeautiful girls that would normally serve as harem fodder in a tsundere/yandere fashion? An angry drunk and passive-aggressive bitch.\\n\r\nImprobable setting? Replace with a \"realistic\" everyday life in dormitory.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so on and on. Follow the formula, add good quality animation, some gags and viola Instant hit. Just as long as the devices stay firmly put in the position given and avoid falling in the older, more used cliches the show will earn lavish praise as \"nongeneric\" and \"original\" storming the top page with ease.\\n\r\nFrankly the only reason why the perverted masochist jokes tape player ( it doesn't deserve to be called a character) exist is because Usa and Kawai already play the role of the straight man and it would disrupt the boke-tsukkomi routine. Though admittedly a realistic normal non-pervy character would indeed be a refreshing and welcomed change of pace.  \\n\\n\r\nThere were only partial implementations at this method before (Hagure Estetica, Golden Time come to mind) and likely because of that only partially succesful, so far only Shingeki no Kyoujin managed to utilize this technique to the fullest contributing to the massive explosion of hype. At that moment someone clever racked his brain and submerged his conscience in greed eventually leading to birth of BwMK popularity.\\n\\n\\n\r\n***My legs came back later in a plastic bag***\\n\\n\r\nGlueing a bunch of largely incompatible tropes is the first and final nail to the coffin, all the rabid stagnation in every department can be retraced to it. Make no mistake, it's not the slice-of-life factor or the weak writing at work, it's just that progress can't be allowed. The only distinctive feature and source of popularity is the anti-trend approach, should it take one step away from the stiff design there won't be any difference between every other weak sol/harem/comedy/whatanot in existence and the show would quickly fade into obscurity. Just read any already existing review and it's clear that sticking out like a sore thumb it's only ever mentioned \"redeemable\" feature. No creativity or brilliance to praise, only cynical engineering and pandering. Because that ploy requires to stay clear of other oversued genres growth in any direction is forbidden - whether it's plot, characters, sol, or romance, or anything.\\n\\n\\n\r\n***Metal papers, metal pens, metal hearts, metal hands***\\n\\n\r\nStory needs to progress from point A to B, however for reasons mentioned above that will not happen. Even if we accept the pretext of SOL not strictly requiring a plotline, it doesn't mean it couldn't carry any message, meaning or at the very least show a hint of effort made to make it enjoyable. That applies much more so when it makes any claims at being a realistic tale. I've seen series that followed the \"cute girl doing x\" formula straight and still managed to deliver a satysfying conlcusion, like Love Lab (ironically originating from same author and studios) where protagonist friendships systematically evolved. Hell, even Hyakko and Soredemo Machi which rely entirely on most typical sol cliches manged to humorously ground themselves in reality, playing with tropes constantly to create a fairly unique experience.  Not doing is one thing, removing all possibility of effort is another, and deserves criticism.\\n\\n\r\nGood romance is always accompanied by it's two best friends: interaction and development, and there's neither here. Sempai is nested in her little world up to autistic levels and Usa is completly oblivious to the cold shoulder received regardless of efforts for 8 episodes straight. It's a wonder she didn't press stalker charges against him yet, this was to be a realistic theme supposedly? And the highest point ever reached is exchanging telephone numbers was already a shock. Even it was for non-romantic reasons. Ah yes, she blushes occasionally too. Holo & Lawrence cannot compete with this brilliance.\\n\\n\r\nAttempting to mix in realism along the goofy outline purely for the sake of satysfying the condition of antitrend just made matters a lot worse. With only randomness for randomness sake BwmnK might have slipped away as a lower grade comedy not worth commenting on, but that's exactly the main issue! It wants to escape from certain cliches so it had to be assembled in this hideous fashion, even it resulted in consistency of chocolate spaghetti. When all attempts at profoundness are confronted with scenes where a supposedly 16 year old girl is at risk of getting run over by car because she can't get her nose from the book like helpless small child, or that pervert cardboard throwing in his unfunny broken record everywhere, any maturity is flushed down the drain. It's nowhere near realistic, and trying so hard to be when it absolutely shouldn't only makes it more pretentious. \\n\r\nHorribly pretentious, and the only reason it's being reinforced is because \"realism\" will sell today.\\n\\n\r\nLet's be clear - the writing didn't fail, it was replaced completly with forceful marketing. Any possibility of a story (whether strong or weak) was annihilated on conceptual level. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 1/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n***So they put me in a special clasroom where everybody is a robot***\\n\\n\r\nFrozen characterization is a natural consequence of this fatal design flaw:\\n\\n\r\nUsa - typical bland nice-guy harem lead, only minus the harem. To make his blandness stand out. \\n\r\nKawai (junior) - a cybernetic organism, living tissue over metal endoskeleton. Either that or she's suffering from some serious mental illness that prevents her from behaving like an actual teenage girl would. Aside from two or three moments there's little resemblance to human being, and even that gets reseted due to the damaged learning processor.\\n\r\nAngry Drunk - development and importance = 0\\n\r\n.. and the drunkard theme wasn't funny even way back when NGE aired, not to mention Katsuragi Misato has a lot of depth to her. \\n\r\nPassive-Agressive Bitch - development and importance = 0\\n\r\n..unless emphasizing Usa's sky-high blandness during that one cafe scene can be considered important.\\n\r\nPervert Jukebox - please insert coin to hear gag *BEEP* please insert coin...\\n\r\nManor Owner - typical plot advancement lady, except there's no plot so let's go with Gag Instigation Automaton. Oh yeah, she also blushes (WHY DOES EVERYONE KEEP BLUSHING? Is their blood pressure too high?)\\n\r\nSecondary Harem Girl - if you've been reading attentively up to this point you might ask why she was even introduced if the objective is to avoid certain cliches? Simple - she's there to make protagonist bland nicety stand out more. And to show how passionate is his stalking.. pardon, love for the main harem girl, since complete lack of romantic development makes it difficult  to evaluate the status of the relationship. She's also a fan of stalking, they'd make such a good couple! Aside from fanservice function no more involvement is allowed. Expect for blushing. And stalking.\\n\\n\r\nWith the rest of the cast possesing maturity and relevance on the level of the Chuunibyo Brigade, no one else is worth mentioning. Not much characters as cardboards, only titanium-enhanced for extra stiffness. Adding a MECHA tag to this anime is completly justified, any objections?\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 1/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n***Hyperalloy combat chassis, micro processor-controlled, fully armored. Very tough***\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is up to par with modern standards. Good outlooks are necessary to lure as many viewers as possible for the trick to work properly after all. In fact it's good enough that I've only dozed off several times instead of sleeping through the whole thing. So good that all the frequent blushing made me authentically worry for the cast's cholesterol levels. \\n\r\nNothing outstanding about the sound, a passing grade.\\n\\n\r\nART 8/10\\n\r\nSOUND 6/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n***Basic psychology is among my sub-routines***\\n\\n\r\nYou might argue that entertainment is a subjective matter, and as long as someone enjoys it I've no right to judge it. Well that's a topic for a different essay and a different time, but even if we go with that track of thought I still have a right to have an opinion, as well make make personal observations. I can realise that even with a complete mess of a design delivering comedy should still be possible, yet the jokes fall vastly inferior over the witty thought-provoking banters from Seitokai Yakuindomo or the subtle physical/erotic gags of Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan. I can observe that romance has less development than an average ongoing shoujo manga (and that's saying something). I can see the show stubbornly refuses to resolve subplots (haha plot), for it would be it's own undoing and while not taking any form whatsover, forever intending to cover up irrepairable structural errors with goofiness. And it's clear that the main heroine is not even attractive enough to bear with her dreadful robotic demeanour, and so are the reasons why it must be like that.\\n\\n\r\nI tried to enjoy this but I couldn't. Not even because it's weak or lowbrow, it's the lack of intention to put effort pushed me away the most. I can't stand something that replaced writing with a crude low scheme. Same goes for humor enforcing assumptions that this-or that is funny in a repetitive, intrusive manner. It feels just like those american sitcoms where an artificial laughter in the background is instructing me on when should I laugh. It's very hard to enjoy something that tries to sneak into your consciousness with the subtletly of a sledgehammer, when it could try to catch your attention instead. At every turn, with every antic, every wannabe character, every pseudo-plot point it incessantly reminds me that every single element was artificialy crafted and not a single damn was given, which leads me to only one conclusion. \\n\r\nBwMnK is not anime, but a small scale commercial social enineering project. Cold and impersonal, analyzing thought patterns and programming responses in a creepy 1984 fashion simply screams for a meticulous dismantling.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 1/10\\n\r\nENJOYMENT OF QUOTING VARIOUS POPULAR MEDIA: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n***Do you guys come off an assembly line or something?***\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to predict the defensive responses so to save time I'll take the liberty of shooting them down hard right now. Consider this something like a reviewing FAQ. And be grateful, I'm being considerate enough to save you the effort of writing a pointless rant (and the pain of a migraine for me from reading it):\\n\\n\r\n1) ACTUALLY IN THE NOVEL/ MANGA/ BABYLONIAN MANUSCRIPT..\\n\r\nSource material doesn't matter. Only the anime alone is reviewed.\\n\\n\r\n2) U MAD BRO? WHY U HAETIN SO MUCH BRO?\\n\r\nCriticism doesn't equal hate. And there's plenty to criticise here. Learn the diffference. And while you're at it learn proper English too.\\n\\n\r\n3) THE (insert anime title) IS THE BEST THING EVER AND YOU DUMB FOR GIVING IT A LOW SCORE!!\\n\r\nGo troll somewhere else.\\n\\n\r\n4) U HUV SHEET TASTE THATS WHY U NO LIEK (insert anime name)\\n\r\nSo entartainment is subjective and I'm wrong to rate it, but you judging my tastes is perfectly a-o-key? Logic.\\n\\n\r\n5) YOU NEED TO CHILL BRO! IT'S JUST ANIME\\n\r\nYou've crushed my argumentation completly. All my points were proven wrong.\\n\r\nNot.\\n\r\nAnd stop bro-ing at me.\\n\\n\r\n6) Why did you watch the show if you didn't like it?\\n\r\nA logical question, a truly rare find on the internet. Putting it simply the subject of psychological manipulation is something like a hobby for me, and the more cheap and insolent the device the more fun it's to hack it into pieces. Plus it's popularity was getting really pesky :P\\n\\n\r\n7) YOU HAET IT SO MUCH BUT STILL WRITE A REVIEW FOR ATTENTION U SAD LONELY DISGUSTING OTAKU\\n\\n\r\nI've had tons of fun while writing this review, implementing all those various quotes alone made me grin all the time :)\\n\r\nAnd it's kind of the reverse, it's the show that craved for attention so desperately it's hard to ignore. It got what it wanted :P\\n\\n\r\n8)  YOU ARE WRONG, THE (insert show element) IS ACTUALLY GOOD\\n\r\nWatch some actually good anime, make a comparison and then reconsider.\\n\\n\r\n9) YOU ARE WRONG!!!\\n\r\nNO U!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\n10) LET'S SEE YOU MAKE A BETTER ANIME\\n\r\nIf you really make a comment of that unfunny retardation magnitude you're getting perma banned on my profile without warning. Even my tolerance has it's limits.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on but this should cover the main points. Now you have no more need to rabidly spill organic matter of various origins over my comments page. Give a hoot, don't pollute!\\n\\n\\n\r\n***It's a long walk back to reality***\\n\\n\r\nSummarising Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou has nothing to offer. Design shamelessly set on harvesting trends with no regards for the means crippled all potential right at the drawing board. Everything accomplished was done better in many other titles, be it comedy, romance, sol, realism, harem or even sex jokes with animation. Not enjoyable on the most crass undemanding levels with nothing to praise beside animation quality and only providing a small analytical skills exercise for this reviewer, it's gets a horrible 2/10 overall score. Watch something else, ANYTHING else.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for this new brand of psychologically oriented directing - it needs to be scorched, scattered and forgotten. Anime deserves better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n***all quotes, titles, names etc belong to their respective owners, utilized per Fair Use policy. Parody, reviewing, nonprofit, blah blah, don't sue and all that stuff***",

            "content": "This show was a first for me, it was the first time I read the entire manga before watching the anime. As a result, I enjoyed it far more than I would have otherwise. I now recommend always searching out a well-translated mange before watching an anime whenever possible as it adds a lot of depth to the anime. Its not like it is here in the West where the movie or show versions are adaptations and highly altered. So far, I have found that anime really strives to bring the manga to life and tell the story as richly and accurately as possible, withfrequent nods to story and character elements that can't be covered. \\n\\n\r\nI watched this a while ago and am still following the anime so apologies if its a little vague. The story is a little typical with a boy at the mercy of circumstance finding himself in various flirt-prone scenarios. However, the case of well realized characters also makes this much more relatable to older audiences than most, often moving back and forth between seinen and shojo/shonen themes.  The Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou makes almost constant visual references to the manga which may go completely unnoticed if it is skipped, and is filled with great portrayals of the romance and tender \"youth\" which highlight the series. Its a great comedy romance that focuses on modest and subtle interactions between the main characters and highly extravagant interactions between everyone else.  I highly recommend it and that you seek out the manga first!",

            "content": "Kazunari Usa is a Japanese high school freshman who finds himself living the dream: his parents are out on work assignment, leaving him to enjoy independent life at a boarding house where he cohabitates with his cute bookworm senpai. Unfortunately for Usa, the other tenants at the Kawai Complex prove to be anything but normal. The title \"Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou\" (\"We Are All From Kawai Complex\") is a play on words with the double meaning \"We Are All Pitiful,\" and the residents of the Kawai Complex all exemplify this in different ways. This anime chronicles Usa's misadventures amongst this new group of vexing personalities.\r\nKawaisoufalls squarely into the \"slice of life\" genre. There's no continuous plot to drag us through the series. It is episodic in nature, with each episode introducing a new stimulus for the cast to react to. Most scenarios force protagonist Usa into uncomfortable (often socially awkward or sexual) situations. This is played mainly for laughs, though sometimes we get dramatic character-building moments out of it.\\n\\n\r\nUsa's discomfort serves as the main source of Kawaisou's comedy, executing manzai (the straight man/funny man act), with our protagonist playing the role of straight man and the rest of the household serving as a revolving door of ridiculous antics. This can sometimes feel redundant, however. Because each of the supporting characters is, for purposes of comedy, mostly defined by a single trait exaggerated to varying degrees, it feels like we go back to the same bag of tricks a bit too often.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, Kawaisou's comedy pulls from a fairly large bag. In addition to our straight man/funny man pairings involving the protagonist, the supporting cast members are also able to spin new jokes off each other's embarassing situations. This gives us a good amount of variety in gags, enough to keep things fresh even if some of the beats feel familiar. The comedy hits more often than it misses, and perhaps Kawaisou's greatest virtue is that it always moves forward at a steady clip: even when gags do fall flat, they're in-and-out before they have the chance to get too annoying.\\n\\n\r\nKawaisou's comedy is enhanced by its judicious use of visuals, frequently inserting highly exaggerated and stylized artwork to great effect during gags. Apart from this, Kawaisou's visual direction maintains an idyllic vibe by constraining the bulk of the action to the Kawai Complex, allowing the show to keep a consistent color palette, which is notable for its use of contrast and bright hues. Particular attention is paid to the lighting in each scene. While the animation is passable, Kawaisou is gorgeous within each individual frame.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the supporting cast members start off as two-dimensional, but even as two-dimensional characters, they benefit from being unique. The cast of Kawaisou is atypical not only in the sense that its members deviate from commonly-accepted social conventions (much to the irritation of our protagonist), but also that they're able to confront problems and support one another as a family. Each of the supporting cast members also gets some dedicated time during which the series explores their character, and we get a better idea of what makes each of them tick. These different character \"arcs\" are executed to varying degrees of success, but chiefly, these arcs allow the characters to feel like people rather than props that exist solely for our protagonist to react to. Despite the relative lack of progression inherent in slice-of-life shows like Kawaisou, there is real character development.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Kawaisou doesn't make any radical attempts to innovate within the slice of life genre, the anime is often playfully and refreshingly subversive. Kawaisou is well aware of the ways in which it could be cliche, often feinting toward that direction and misleading the audience before pulling the rug out from under them and laughing both at us and itself.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Usa's \"nice guy\" behavior early on causes him to take a concerted interest in reaching out to his introvert bookworm senpai, Ritsu. In the interest of \"rescuing\" her from what he perceives to be a state of loneliness, Usa cultivates a series of habits which border on stalker-like: he enters full-on appeasement mode and begins following her around doing everything he can to \"help\" her break out of her shell. Rather than reward Usa for this faux-nice behavior, numerous cast members call him out on his behavior, Usa realizes that he's being a bit nutty, and we all have a good laugh at his expense.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, Kawaisou's respecful depiction of Ritsu's introversion is one of the show's more impressive feats. Ritsu is far from the tree as far as the \"shy anime girl\" trope is concerned. She's not anti-social, and she does have it in her to enjoy the company of others, but she prefers to be alone with her books. Ritsu's introversion is not portrayed as a problem to be solved, but rather just one facet of her personality that makes her a bit unusual at first glance without constituting the entirety of her character. Introverts will likely be able to relate and appreciate this.\\n\\n\r\nAlso refreshing is the fact that Kawaisou doesn't beat around the bush when it comes to topics of sexuality, while at the same time refraining from over-sexualization. All of the characters in Kawaisou are sexual beings to some degree, and in the context of the home, none of them seem particularly bashful about discussing it, with perhaps the exception of our virgin protagonist. Kawaisou doesn't use sex as a tool to titilate or arouse the audience. Rather, the sexual aspects of the various cast members serve to further illuminate and color their personalities, and Kawaisou makes it apparent that sexuality is a critical component for each of these characters. Particularly notable is Mayumi, a bitter 30-year-old office lady who is constantly struggling to find a stable man who will respect her, a goal that seems at odds with her own sexual impulses. Mayumi is also haunted by the feeling that she's past the apex of her value on the dating market, and she constantly alternates between jealousy and disdain for younger couples. While Mayumi's constant sexual conflicts are mostly played as a source of comedy, if you remove this sexual aspect of her personality, you lose the character. Kawaisou handles sexuality in a manner that is respectful while still mining it as a source of laughs.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the relationship between \"nice guy\" protagonist Usa and introvert senpai bookworm Ritsu serves as the bread and butter of our story. The story of an overly-accomodating borderline obsessed stalker \"nice guy\" might be a massive turn-off in other contexts, but Kawaisou incorporates his behavior in a manner which is both self-aware and funny. The stoic bookworm who seldom cracks a smile might also look cliched on the surface level, but there's real joy to be found in the story that centers on the relationship between these two. That said, if you're looking for a romance story, you probably won't find it here. Rather than attempting to tell a story about love, Kawaisou tells us a story about a teenager learning to coexist with people from different walks of life.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThis review is written by members of the club Quiet Discourse.

As we now, if it's full comedy anime then it'll never far from unique \"crazy\" personalities from each character, and this show are \"loaded\" of that point. With all those variant \"unique\" personalities, you won't be bored even for just a second. Pervert behavior and echi content are still inperfect portion and enrich the entire show with a bit mature jokes.\\n\\n\r\nBokura wa Minna Kawaisou was also been made with a great graphic and effect. The animation are detailed, smooth, and bright. The design of the character are simple yet appealing. All makes it so fascinating. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the staff there's Hanazawa Kana as the MC seiyuu, Kana chan cute voice's is always lovely to hear, her experience and skill as seiyuu are nothing less expected, not to mention she also sang the theme song for it, makes me gave an extra point. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoy this anime very much, it's really fun watching frenzy daily life like what happened in Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou, I highly recommend it for any of you who likes comedy romance.",

            "content": "Every now and then when I go out of my way to look for a new romance anime to watch, I can't seem to help but to come across the whole anime \"3 in one 1\" genre package where romance comes bundle up with comedy and slice of life/school life like it's one of those 3 in 1 instant coffee packets. I mean it's not like I have anything against the two other genres but sometimes I just want to watch something purely romance just like how sometimes I just enjoy drinking coffee without sugar and creamer. But I digress, this genre bundle seems tobe more common with animes targeted towards male audiences, rehashing cliches over and over again, building an impression that male targeted romance would not likely subsist without being comical, as to \"being in love\" is in the eyes of others, that pitiful?\\n\\n\r\nEnter Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou literally translated as \"We Are All From Dormitory Kawai\" or serves as a double entendre for \"We are all Pitiful\" a foreshadowing for all the word plays to come. Truly the main gimmick of the series revolves around the pitiful love endeavors of the Kawai Dormitory\u2019s claimed abnormal inhabitants, a place oozing of RomComs juices, focusing on the main protagonist Usa Kazunari and his love-on-first-sight heroine, Kawai Ritsu. Now, I'll admit that it doesn't take much for me to set eyes and commit to an anime. Despite alarms going off saying this would be another generic RomCom just based off its synopsis, if the main heroine is short haired, well that's basically my Kryptonite. Make it a short haired girl with a dandere attitude combo, well then you might as well just bury me already. So I lunge towards the series just like how I lunge towards old ladies giving out free samples at the local supermarket. Giving the anime a shot, I thought I could at least go down with a good eye candy but in the end what I got did not disappoint me. \\n\\n\r\nThe story while does not bring much new or innovative addition to the RomCom genre did caught my attention for having the right balance of comedy, romance and slice of life. The comedy aspect was not too overbearing as it does not take itself seriously nor try to capitalize much on the pitiful love ideals of its characters until it becomes irritating as many RomCom had done before. It had enough just enough romantic elements which in my opinion does not alienate its audiences by giving us someone like Usa, to constantly cheer for instead of the common plot-line of directly implying from the start that they could both very likely hit it off perfectly. Every now and then, interference from the other cast does not annoy me as some other RomCom does but serves only to heighten the sweet release should the two ever hit it off. The slice of life aspect of the story is executed somewhat interestingly enough even though there were scenes which are mundane due to the slow progress of the plot and/or character development. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style pretty much within my tastes, character design had hard colours reminiscent of animation style from a couple years back but with slightly more realistic body and face proportions. Soft tones and shades for the background design compliments well with the character design giving enough contrast enabling it to stand out. The occasional anthropomorphism of characters into their chibi forms goes well with the comedic scenes, not over-employing it too much until it loses its original aesthetics. I had sound and music on a positive note as well, with an mellow opening and an upbeat ending, whereas voice actors did approvingly well with their character portrayals.  \\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters had the most impact on me granted the bulk of my score, ranging from a variety of different personalities, each somehow related to their somewhat pitiful love endeavors. Though considered abnormal by societal standards, to me are not we more accustomed to weird characters in the anime scene which makes completely normal people like Usa seem to be the weird one for not fitting in. While the story occasionally revolves around Usa and Kawai, the other tenants do have their fair share appearance and contribution to the series.\\n\\n\r\nUsa Kazunari, the protagonist, the ring leader of the handful of claimed weirdos in his life, is pretty normal you can get and this is speaking on the real world perspective, not those anime definitions of normal. He is as plain as you can get. He does things what a normal boy would do to gain attention of his love interest, which includes but not limited to, trying to get her to open up to him, picking up common interest to initiate topics for conversation and having sexual fantasies. In his position, being a junior going after a senior is pretty uncommon as far as the handful of animes I had picked up. He has trouble conveying his feelings but this is not entirely his fault when he has to deal with such a dysfunctional personality that is of his love interest. He\u2019s the nice guy type however girls do not just fall head over heels for him. He has a predictable personality but what else can you expect from a guy who gets elated over simply seeing a different expression from Kawai. Actually scratch that, I would too, that's the perk of liking a dandere, and the net gain from the emotional difference is truly staggering. Though, Usa often pushes his luck too far, overestimating his boundaries with Kawai, taking far subtle hints and exaggerating it causing for more discomfort towards her than benefits towards him.\\n\\n\r\nKawai Ritsu, the main heroine, on the other hand is very reserved with her feelings though when she gets engrossed with a book she really likes, her emotions starts leaking out. A bookworm and loner in personality, she does not mind being alone as the thought of maintaining social etiquettes with friends and acquaintances could be overbearing. Putting on a friendly persona for the benefit of her friends is emotional taxing for her as such a typical response from an introvert. Though she eventually opens up more towards her dorm-mates or \"tenants\" since her parent technically owns the dorm, particularly towards Usa but this was squandered of course by his own insecurity or interference by third parties.  She may appear stoic at times but she does have her fair share of emotional distress at times as she is unable to cope with sudden social expectations.\\n\\n\r\n Shirosaki, the pervert of the dorm with his overly masochistic personality, would not be crossed out as the comic relief of the show initially. However he is caring in nature and good at tying all sorts of knots but his sexual disposition makes him hard or seemingly incapable to requite feelings of love due to the constant mocking and physical abuse of his dorm-mates. Despite this, he always comes up with entertaining ideas to kill boredom at the dorm. Often his partner in crime, Mayumi, the mature adult woman, has trouble reeling in a keeper due to implicitly implied by the other tenants as being too \"loose\" or easily swayed or charmed. She is unstable in nature, always drinking to soothe her sadness and also has a weak tolerance to other people being happy or having fun without her. Not being one to be left out, she constantly tries to top Usa by foiling his attempt at youthful love with Kawai. Though it seems sometimes she genuine does not want Usa at his chance with Kawai, Mayumi\u2019s actions makes it all the more worthwhile by making sure he actually puts in more effort and not simply resorting to cheap tricks to get on Kawai\u2019s good side. I would take this sort of interference any day rather than the \"best friend whom never get laid\" or \"harem girls\" interference.  Sayaka, on the other hand, with her mischievous and sadistic attitudes may appear to be most favourable among the other tenants in terms of relationship. However she herself has trouble actually committing to one and prefers to ditch them like used tampons. Similar to Kawai, Sayaka has to constantly put up a likeable persona with her male acquaintances which could also be seen literally with the amount of make-up she puts on. Surprisingly she is still a good person at heart, never abandoning her old friends even after moving to the city from the countryside. As much as she toys with Usa, she does help him out on certain occasions, though the former proved to be much more. Last but not least the caretaker of the dorm, Sumiko, who is also Kawai\u2019s grand aunt. Kind but knowing when to get strict and threatening at times, she make sure abuses from Mayumi and Sayaka towards Usa is kept moderately. She has a special rule where she cooks the favourite meal of the tenant for the evening if the specific tenant is depressed. Even though she is elder figure, she can be playful and optimistic at times but ensures that the strict dorm rules are complied by its tenants. Now I did assume everyone in the dorm had some kind of love related issues.  Sumiko may be unmarried given she kept onto her family\u2019s name but I could be wrong. But if this stands true I guess she has a few problems of her own when it comes to her love life.\\n\\n\r\nThis series was thoroughly enjoyable despite initially thinking that the mundane slice of life aspect with eclipse any redeeming comical factor the anime have to promise. In the right amount of doses with well-placed timing, I had a good laugh at their antics just like how I laugh with my real friends. They are not obligated to get to know each other in the dorm but they do so knowing they would be much more entertained putting up with each other than locking themselves in their room (though maybe Shiro would be fond the whole locking idea) Watching this series makes me feel like I too am part of Kawai Dormitory and all its weirdness. Usa despite having a very associable personality does not want to make me embody his character but merely cheer him in his often botched attempts at getting closer with Kawai. Running gags and world play galore, this show is kept going by its cast, ensuring that even a dull moment could quickly be turned into a slapstick gag. While the slow pace of the show might be unappealing to some audiences, the relationship between Usa and Kawai shows how two people with polarizing personalities should not be rush. The series may be trying to portray that it is not their weirdness that is used as common grounds that keeps them together as a unit but their ability to tolerate and overcome each other\u2019s abnormal behaviours. This is depicted as Usa, being the epitome of weird tolerance though he at times thinks it is better to just avoid these circumstances, always seems to be drawn towards it. Pitiful as it is, seeing Usa constantly trying to run away from his fate only to return it is somewhat entertaining to me.\\n\\n\r\nSo in a nutshell, Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou may not be ground breaking in the RomCom + SOL genre, it certainly shows that the formula is still entertaining and engaging when executed properly. I may not have gotten my pure romance experience but it does instil in me the desire to continue observing the progresses of the tenants of Kawai Dormitory. I came for the short haired girl but left with a bunch of weirdos lingering in my mind. So the questions are, \u201cShould I recommend this anime?\u201d \u201cWas I satisfied with the ending?\u201d \u201cAm I barred from my local supermarket?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe answer is \u201cYes\u201d. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

I would place Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou in the top 5 anime of 2014.\r\nStory [7/10]\r\nBokura wa Minna Kawaisou is a typical romantic comedy. Most of it is set in a boarding house. You have the main character, Usa, a seemingly normal male, surrounded by \"weirdos\". Shiro the masochist, Mayumi the woman with crappy taste in men, Sayaka the bitch (lul jk i love her), and the main character's love interest, Ritsu. All in all, it seems to be a rather overused setup. Yet,every week I found myself excited to watch the next episode that aired.\\n\\n\r\nWhat sets Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou from other dorm life animes is how the story is executed. It's casual. It's relaxed. Everything flows so smoothly that it seems almost natural.  It doesn't try hard to force the viewer to sympathize with the characters. Yeah, I'm looking at you, Sakurasou. It's a lighthearted anime that anyone looking to relax for half an hour can enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nArt [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nMy first thought when I saw the artwork was \"shiny\". Kawaisou enjoys exaggerating the lighted areas of scenery and hair. Which isn't a bad thing. The brightness worked well with the mood of the anime. The scenery was stunning and the character art was pretty nice.\\n\\n\r\nRitsu's lips were sometimes too shiny for me, though.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nOutstanding OP and ED. I usually don't listen to OPs and almost never listen to EDs but dang, they just made me feel so happy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the characters are somewhat stereotypes of typical weirdos, they show signs of having more than one dimension of personality. I might have been a bit biased because I love Ritsu's character. She's a great example of a normal, everyday introvert. Her character's not done in an extreme way, where she's either some cold, heartless bitch or a supershy book reading nerd. She's normal. And that's what I think is the best part of Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou. Very well done.\\n\\n\r\nRitsu's laugh is also super cute.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime. It was one of the few series that I looked forward to each and every week. Watching it was a very relaxing and enjoyable experience\\n\\n",

            "content": "'Kawai Complex' is like a blend of romcom, adult jokes, anime seinen elements and wackiness. The main character Usa moves into a boarding house, whom coincidentally meets the girl of his love, Ritsu. Unfortunately the rest of the residents consist of a creepy masochist, a bodacious drunk woman and a backstabbing troublesome girl who puts a mask of cheerfulness to lead men on.\r\nDepending on your preferences, you may either like or hate the characters. But the primary focus is based on the relationship of Usa and Kana Hanaz- I mean, Ritsu; a shy, introvert girl who has a love for books and nothing else. Usaon the other hand is like a kinda a semi-beta who gets constantly teased and cannot read situations for LIFE at times. Their relationship is subtle and not forceful - which is nice - however the development hates speed. It's not like a snail crossing the road; it's more like a truck in a middle of a traffic jam. Running out of petrol.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is primarily comedy, but it has its serious moments. And the problem is that it has difficulties deciding what it wants to be. Comedy scenes are one after another. Other comedy moments are scattered all over the place during the course of the show, which can damage its pace of development at times. There's a few moments where there's no interruption (like episode 8's scene for example), but other than that, the mood gets killed by a punchline or silly occurrence. This isn't necessarily bad in entertainment's point of view, and I can ensure you this is a comedy series at heart. It just throws more cars in the traffic jam, so when you think 'oh wow plot is progressing!'; no, it's really not.\\n\\n\r\nAs a comedy though, it's a pretty entertaining show. But it's not for everyone, and can bring back the bad 'typical Japanese humour'. Lots of pervy jokes, but note this is not labeled an ecchi. It has its hot moments, but it's not immature, which is a change. The characters aren't underaged teenagers surrounded by random boobies in highschool. The ecchiness is actually justified and so the perverted, romantic or older jokes seem more natural coming from the cast suited for this type of comedy. But a lot of straight-man jokes are present, and if you're allergic to Japanese humour then avoid. It's not a big offender though, so even if your fondness of it is low, you should be safe anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no typical tropes of characters like tsunderes - somewhat refreshing - but their tropes aren't really unique either. Their portrayed as what their characters are supposed to be; a drunk woman getting dumped and two-timed, whilst picking on people. A bitch messing with other guys' hearts with a violent nature. And the neck-beard who gains pleasure from displeasing words and pain. They offer a variety of jokes, and they do feel alive at times, but they're not particularly pass 1-dimensional either.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough of the side characters. Usa can be plain, but he's bearable. Even likable at times. The other times is where his thought process passes comprehension. No, he's not completely beta, but he can't read the mood, nor can he tell whether he's ticking off another person  or not. He also tends to fixates his desires way too much and this leads to behavior of density. Expressions go over his head; this can be a large annoyance to some. And honestly, I'm all open to incompetent characters, but Usa continues to have the attitude of \"SENPAI PLEASE NOTICE ME~\" throughout the show. He gradually improves though, so there's that.\\n\\n\r\nRitsu wasn't favoured by me that much in the beginning. The first problem was how lazy Kana Hanazawa was with this voice acting. Just another Kana. Thankfully her voice actually starts to fit her actual character, and I can indeed say it's her most fitting role. This is because Ritsu's nature is quite intriguing, well, if not for Usa's monologues of grabbing HER LOVE 24/7. Despite being an overly quiet character, she's no kuudere... most of the time. Her development is interesting in a way that he deals with situations involving other people, and the way she opens up to particular people has some depth in it as well. But alas, her developing isn't so large either, especially for being the main girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe two MC's relationship is subtle, and it actually has some depth without shoving it in your face. But unfortunately the impact of that development is lost due to jokes and random characters interrupting every time. They overcome misunderstandings, feelings inside of them and expressions, and strengthen their bonds. It's just not very consistent when labeled as a comedy because which one is it supposed to be? Comedy or serious?\\n\\n\r\nAnd well, you can argue it's never meant to be a serious show. I can accept that, but if it really was, like a proper full-on comedy show, then all the staggering development, plot points and serious events that is cut off mid-way wouldn't be present. And it's a shame, because I think it had potential to put forward those perhaps tear-jerking scenes with its in-depth characters. But yet it probably had no potential as well due to the concept of a complex having characters filled with... complexity of strange and weird.\\n\\n\r\nBrains Base took very careful consideration in the animation. Lots of filters for lighting effects were crafted well, and the art is stylized and well-drawn. There's no terrible quality, due to the fact that a lot of comedy remarks goes into chibi mode. Fluid movement, but not many anyway. A lot of the voice actors do well, even in the straight-man jokes, but sometimes the two MC's sound quite lazy. OST accompanies the atmosphere well, and overall the show looks very, very lovely compared to others.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my criticisms, it was a thoroughly enjoyable show. It was refreshing, and at the same time it wasn't. For every unique element and positive trope it made, it took another one down. Kind of like Usa. He gets into lucky situations, only to be damned by misfortune. In the end, I didn't really know what direction this show was even supposed to take, but I can safely say the premise, characters and setting were definitely refreshing and enjoyable to watch. I just wished the show had the ability to blend in both its funny and serious moments, instead of staggering them here and there.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, if you aren't bothered with presented plot elements that are hardly fleshed out properly, then check this out for an amusing romance comedy.",

            "content": "Why do I like this series ? NO ECCHI, NO HAREM; SIMPLE SLICE OF LIFE, SIMPLE LOVE STORY . There is not much love, but there's lots of human to human interaction and understanding of humans feelings and emotions and this is what you can expect from a slice of life story. Genuine feelings. Genuine relationships.\r\ni really liked it because ANIME is ahead of MANGA and i dearly wish to know what happened in the story hence it increased value of ANIME more into my eyes.\r\nMANGA is SETUP in very good city >> Which has lot of monumetal and beautiful places and the same youwatch in anime hence visual treat. &gt;&gt;&gt; KAWAHARA TOWN, GIFU .\\n\\n\r\nART: it has really good art. i can compare it to 5 cm per second in many ways. SENTAI FILMWORKS licensed it and this is why it looked me familiar to 5CM PER SECOND. &gt;&gt;licenesed by sentai filmworks\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: story is quite good . i find MS. RITSU CHAN quite unique and realistic and natural . USA KUN seems the usual male character but he is more wise than others as well as quite authentic. He is quite NORMAL hence attract attention.\\n\r\nrest of the characters are those cliched usual characters . again i haven't read much of romance or comedy having cliched characters but they felt like other characters we all have seen before. still they have their own unique points and stand out and show their worth and value in the story. yes i would like to say they have their own personality and now appear slightly more different than usual characters we see.\\n\\n\r\nMS. KAWAI RITSU CHAN is carrying the whole show. sensible,have feelings show great expressions, beautiful, adorable,cute, talk straight to the point. care about others.innocent and pure. MS. KAWAI RITSU CHAN sooth your heart and make you feel human emotions human feelings as well as humanity again.\\n\\n\r\ncliche in story i haven't found much . again i can't judge much regarding this matter. i am not a fervent anime watcher . this is an episodic series where 1 thing happens in whole episode but many important life lessons you get from it. simple SLICE OF LIFE story which makes it really attractive.\\n\\n\r\nhumour is simple and good.actually this is the ANIME that was able to make me LAUGH much more.\\n\r\nMOST important thing that caught my eye is LOVE STORY having little romance. simple relationship building. natural expressions and feelings. PURE INNOCENT LOVE . FEELINGS grow up slowly slowly but USA KUN is ALREADY in DEEP LOVE\\n\r\nA SWEET LOVE STORY IN DAY TO DAY LIFE .\\n\\n\r\nAgain i am not clear about what definition people think of in case of ROMANCE. if anime reaches far enough into the manga, then you will get 2 to 3 occasions of romance. nowadays even simple interaction between characters is considered romance hence i can't say much about what people consider as romance.\\n\\n\r\nit has LOVE STORY . simple straight and without any cliches . you will really love both MS. RITSU CHAN AND USA KUN . you will love their relationship. now if you have watched many manga/anime series having romance you will become desperate to watch more romantic scenes as well progression in relationship. their feelings are innocent and tender and undefined hence best to watch this relationship as it is.\\n\\n\r\nthe other thing that makes the anime stand is usage of SFX/SIDETEXT which is thrown into the anime to give us more about what characters think and saying and feel giving us more info details and help us enjoy more understand more .\\n\\n\r\nSOUNDTRACK : SOUND : i enjoyed both opening and ending though i liked opening more . music really goes well with story and characters and easily blend and anime much more enjoyment. now SONG lines or LYRICS are really beautiful and completely give us depiction of the story and characters. BACKGROUND music isn't loud . you can feel the music going really well with the flow of story and emotions and feelings of characters. PEACEFUL AND SOOTHING MUSIC\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT : I'm really enjoying this anime. I am too much attached to this series and want to know what exactly happened in series. enjoyed each and every episode and planning to re-watch again\\n\\n\r\nANIME IS COMPLETELY FOLLOWING MANGA which makes it even more worth watchable as well as enjoyable .\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL : I GIVE IT 10 . for such a beautiful story such a beautiful manga and making such a beautiful ANIME.\\n\\n\r\nANIME IS LIVING UP TO STANDARDS AND SHINING BRIGHTLY .",

            "content": "English isn't my native language - I appologize for my mistakes beforehand. I just finished watching \"Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou\" (yeah, I know, it's August and I finished watching anime from spring season... I really don't have enough free time ;| ) and decided to make a short review of it. \r\n\tThis show is one of those love comedies which decided to take a different approach to romance and... failed. At least in terms of that type of romance I was looking for. But let's not rush, first things first. \r\nStory \r\n\tThe protagonist, Kazunari Usa (though I don't remeber a single time when he wasn'tcalled \"Usa-kun\"), is a completely average highschooler. Starting this year he'll be living alone... or so he thought. His mother rented a room for him in Kawaisou complex which, as he quckily finds out,  is full of weird people. \"Accidentally\" among them there is Ritsu Kawai - a girl Usa had spotted (and immediately got a crush on)  in his school's library. \\n\\n\r\n\tNo, there are no sudden plot twists or surprises - the beginning really is THAT cliche. The plot centers on craz...ekhem daily life in the complex and development of protagonist and herione's reationship. As you can see the setting for the story is pretty similiar to the one in \"Sakuraso no Pet na Kanojo\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\n\tUsa's fellow residents drive this show. They're not, by any means, orginal. In fact it's the opposite, but who said that stereotypical characters can't be good? So before we proceed to descriptions of the main couple let  me tell you a bit about this crazy bunch. \\n\\n\r\n\tLet's start with Shiro (short for Shirosaki). He's my  favourite character in this show. Well, that sounds kind of weird once you know that he's a 100% M - a masochist, who's not even trying to hide it. Obviuosly that makes him a source of many gags, but there's more to it - I'd say Shiro is the most mature character - you'll see him giving advices to other people quite often. Also he's the only character who gets to have his own side story.\\n\\n\r\n\tNext we have Mayumi and Sayaka - two girls who seem to be always fighting each other. There's not really much to say about them. Mayumi - ~30 years old, had dozens of boyfriends, but still gets easilly tricked by men; currently single, and veeery unhappy because of it. Sayaka - university student, master of deceiving and manipulating others (especially guys); in short she's so evil she could easily terrorize the devil himself. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe last but not least is Kawai Sumiko - an old lady and a governor of the Kawaisou building who treats her residents as if they were her own children. She's the only one who can stand against Sayaka and win. For most of the time she doesn't get much attention but her infinite cheerfulness and wide smile contribute greatly to creating warm atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\n\tNow it's time for the main protagonist. I should be able to easilly relate with Usa, after all I'm a highschooler myself, right? No. Nope. Just no. I do understand the cultural difference between Japan and Europe, especially when it comes to relationships between men and women, are huuuuuge.Still I find it simply impossible to relate, even just slightly, with a guy who starts blushing and getting flustered just by looking at the girl he likes, or starts crying from happiness because she showed her care for him. I'm not an emotionless bastard, I think it's nothing abnormal to fell stressed when around a girl you like, but still - there are limits to everything. However, aside from that annoying behaviour I just mentioned Usa isn't a bad character. He's a  normal guy and his only trait that stands out is his ability to attract weird people. \\n\\n\r\n\tMost of the time you see the heroine, Kawai, she'll have her nose burried in a book. She pays little attention to the rest of the world (that includes Usa). Thanks to that she developed the hard-to-approach-and-lonely-girl-aura.\\n\\n\r\n\tHowever, if you're expecting cold and dignified ojou-sama with kuudere personality you'd be dissapointed - she's much closer to the shy girls from a typicall shoujo manga. The main difference is that she doesn't fall for the protagonist few minutes after he appeared. In fact it's the opposite - she's stays rahter passive, even after she realizes she may have some feelings for Usa. Therefore times when she behaves more lively and active, even if she's doing something seemingly insignificant, are very precious for Usa. She also gets some adorable scenes, for example the frog costume during the water-guns battle was ridiculously adorable. \\n\\n\r\n\"Romancy-thingy\"\\n\\n\r\n\tI said earlier that romance in this show is a failure. Well it depends on what you're looking for. I've alerady mentioned this anime is similiar to \"Sakuraso\" and that also applies to romance aspect . Unfortunately if I were to give a proper explanation someone would definitely yell: \"Ha, look at his review! It's full of filthy spoilers!\". So yeahh. What I can tell without revealing any spoilers is that there's simply too little romance in romance (geez, that sounds terrible but I really can't think of any other way to put it).\\n\\n\r\nArt&music\\n\\n\r\n\tThe art in this show is pretty good. The colors are nice, characters' faces don't look too simple and the animation is smooth. The only outstanding thing about art were shots of the Kawaisou complex from above - each with different lightning and colors used looked really good, especially the ones during sunset.\\n\r\nAs for sound... even though I just finished the show I barely remeber it. Opening, ending, OST - they were all painfully average. \\n\\n\r\n\tSo to sum up, I wouldn't recommend watching this anime unless you have enormous amounts of free time. It has major flaws but none of them are crucial enough to make this unwatchable. On the other hand if I were to name something what would make up for those mistakes I could say: characters and humor. At the beginning jokes were pretty good, escpecially the ones which were a parody of typical scenes in love comedies, but in later episodes they get weaker and repeatable. That, unfortuantely, also applies to characters (except Shiro).\\n\\n\r\n\tIn conclusion Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is just as the description of the 6/10 mark on MAL says: \"fine\".  Nothing less, nothing more. \\n\\n\r\n\tThis review came out to be slightly longer than I thought (OK, OK, to be honest I wanted it to be half as long as it is now) and if you managed to get the end - thanks a lot! I'd aprreciate any kind of support you can offer. Feel free to PM me, be it about the contents of this review or the use of language.",

I just finished Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou, it was splendid. I loved how the characters progressed like how at the beginning Kawai barley even talked to Usa but as time went on they slowly began to talk more and the love story took air. This anime had a lot of funny moments, which made this a great experience. I specially enjoyed how Kawai got jealous, when Usa's former middle school classmate appeared. For me Shirosaki was one of themost enjoyable characters, he was unique. The art was nice, it was quite colorful and changed depending on the aura of the characters. I didn't really focus on the sound but it gave a massive effect on the anime. All the characters were great, mainly how Usa didn't notice that Kawai was falling for him. The supporting characters were the main reason Usa got closer to her. I must've spoiled a lot. oops. I enjoyed this anime but one thing that ticked me off was that they never actually kissed. I hate when romance animes do this. In conclusion, it was very good. \\n",

With shoujo romances I like to see a nice a steady progression between the two soon to be flowering pairings. That's that's exactly what I got with Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou - it's a shoujo that's not rushed. However it ends at the climax - and without a second season to wrap everything up, the first season is quite pointless.\r\nThe story follows a high-schooler named Kazunari Usa as he moves into a boarding house complex, illustrating the unique blossoming relationship he has with fellow roommate, Ritsu Kawai.On top of that we see the connections Kazunari develops as a result from meeting his roommates. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound is an area where I find this anime excels in. The sound is perfect; everything from the pedalling of the bikes to the rustling of the bed sheets when someone wakes up is heard, it\u2019s all there. The art is quite special as well, the colours are vibrant and pleasing to the eyes. I urge everyone who has not seen this series yet to download this series, do not steam this anime. Even if you are not a downloader, just download the first episode and compare the quality to that of streaming, you will enjoy and appreciate the art more and find the anime more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharm and loveable characters are very difficult to radiate in an anime, specifically when we get to see a board spectrum of personalities from shy-introvert Ritsu to unusual/creepy Shirosaki to dysfunctional Mayumi. Even with that said everyone in this anime unusually interacts in harmony with each other, and I'm sure you will find someone from this anime that will gravitate towards you. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character development, we have Ritsu as our pupil. Her development is based off the main plot of this anime, which is flowering relationship between herself and Kazunari. If I were to use the caterpillar, cocoon, butterfly analogy; I would say that Ritsu evolved from a caterpillar to a cocoon by the end of the series (watch the anime and you'll understand what I mean). Which I find perfect because it just makes the concept of love more authentic and leaves an air of mystery for the audience for what's anticipated if a sequel is produced. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this anime surprised me in a good way, I was going into this series expecting two people to eventually fall in love, confess to each other and by the end have their first kiss and that would be the end of this anime; just like and typical romantic comedy. To my surprise, it was the complete opposite of what I thought, you will have to watch and see I don\u2019t want to spoil it! I will add, if you're into witty humour and stereotypical iterations between characters in a romantic comedy, this anime is right up your alley. However, if you're the type who just wants an rom-com anime where the main characters profess their love interests to each other, then you should not watch this until a sequel comes out.\\n\\n\r\nLove in real life takes time and work, it doesn\u2019t happen as soon as most romance anime depict it to be. It's refreshing to see that within a short anime, the important aspects of love is not crunched into 12 episodes. Overall I loved this anime and have absolutely no complaints, if you want an authentic romance anime with some witty comedy, I\u2019d suggest you watch Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou. It just needs a second season to finalize everything. \\n",

            "content": "If you\u2019ve attended school before, chances are that you\u2019ve gone to a library once whether it\u2019s for studying, research, reading a good book, or just hanging out with a friend. Not unless like you\u2019re Kazunari Usa of course, who happens to wander into the school library not by a chance to dig into a good book but rather seeing a cute girl deep in her thoughts. Seemingly set by destiny and fate, we later learn that Usa also (again by chance) happens to share the same dormitory of this girl. Her name is Ritsu Kawai and here is the enchanting story between these two charactersof your normal life. \\n\\n\r\nBokura wa Minna Kawaisou (aka as The Kawai Complex Guide to Manors and Hostel Behavior) based off the manga of the same name is animated by Brain Base. Coming from the premise, one should expect this to be a normal slice of life show. But what begin during the first episode isn\u2019t as very typical as Usa encounter a local pervert named Shirosaki. Also perhaps labeling himself as a masochist, his meeting with Usa almost has him arrested. It\u2019s a classic and inspires laughter given how much of a contrast characters with such an introductory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is simple and straightforward but shouldn\u2019t be labeled as romance tale. Sure, we have the nice guy (Usa) meeting stoic Ritsu alone in a quiet school setting. To add to the topping, we get a clear idea that Usa falls in love with her at first sight. There\u2019s no clear word to describe the circumstance or what illustrate such feeling as it\u2019s pure and natural human instinct. At the same time, there\u2019s innocence as Usa\u2019s feelings seems to be honest, sincere, and at times childish. Perhaps the rest is because Usa\u2019s desire to explore the world by himself after moving out of his family\u2019s house for the first time. The catch is that Ritsu is a polar opposite of his character. Whether he likes it or not, Ritsu is in love with books rather than seeking out a boyfriend or future husband. This sets a rather peculiar instance as Usa tries to appeal to her. But looking at it from a clear angle, we notice Ritsu as a character with resilience, a girl with innate sense for literature, and difficult to articulate a conversation with. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean Usa should give him and throw it all away because his chance with Ritsu is always at hand when they share the same dorm. The problem? Some of the other characters\u2019 interference and even Usa\u2019s self-worth. And while the story initially sets up of what viewers may expect, the series hardly explores romance from a dynamic angle. The \u201cwill they or not\u201d isn\u2019t really a question that has answers so your patience will not be rewarded.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up easily, Usa isn\u2019t exactly an appealing main character. He is just too nice and plain for a guy. And like normal guys, he fantasizes about girls in particularly Ritsu. His initial introduction shows him staring at her for several minutes in awe of her beauty and figure. It doesn\u2019t stop there as he often deludes himself from reality and formulates various fantasies involving him and her in some sort of deceptive dreamland. Usa\u2019s dream turns into disfigured when he realizes the lack of attention Ritsu pays to him. Its\u2019 a rather hard counter to his desire but guys like him always try, try, and\u2026try. And tries he does on many opportunities but the results aren\u2019t always favorable. He isn\u2019t exactly an opportunist and takes advantage of a certain situation though. Rather, he is honest and genuinely wants to get to know Ritsu and hopefully climb out of the friend zone. But most times, their relationship seems to be one sided. Being the bookworm that she is, Ritsu is in a fantasy world of her own surrounded by the imaginative ideas of literature while Usa is hopelessly chasing after her like a puppy in love. Throughout the show though, there are times when Ritsu realizes reality and appreciates Usa\u2019s efforts. She sees him as an honest man who is always willing to lend a helping hand when she\u2019s in trouble. These often extend to aiding her with a task, sticking up to her against others, and settling against her worst fears. To express sincerity, she says simple gratitudes such as \u201cThank You\u201d and sometimes apologizes when she feels something she has done isn\u2019t right. While this isn\u2019t exactly a confession, it appeals to Usa\u2019s confidence and makes him feel appreciative for his actions. It\u2019s innocent, charming, and strikes out as what friends do for each other. Yes, it doesn\u2019t qualify as a love story but it\u2019s delightful to find how such contrasting characters can get along in the same place, the Kawai Complex.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, there are other residents there as well. And if you thought either Usa or Ritsu might be hard to get used to, then these characters will strike out as complete oddballs. From minute one they enter the story, it\u2019s easy to see just how different they are. We have Sumiko, the dorm manager. As the oldest member of the dorm, she speaks with wisdom but also strikes fear into others with her sarcastic tone of voice when she\u2019s in a bad mood. Being old doesn\u2019t make her frail at all but instead presents Sumiko as a grandma to be respected. The remaining three members of the dorm includes the pervert Shirosaki whom he met before, Mayumi, and Sakaya. The latter two are lovely ladies with the looks and charm. However, they fall under the stereotypical frenzy of college girls. Everything in their mind is about dating guys and partying. This is especially true for Mayumi who is known to dating the typical \u201cbad boys\u201d and having terrible luck with men in general. For Sayaka, she comes off as a mischievous troublemaker. Unfortunately, almost all the dorm members becomes a subject of her trickery at some points throughout the story. In particular with Mayumi, she pours out her endearing \u201cfeelings\u201d to the point where some might mistake her as a lesbian. It\u2019s all fun and jokes but the show itself sometimes feels far too forceful to accompany these ideas. Some of the jokes could even be labeled as a fetish whether it\u2019s Ritsu\u2019s obsession for books, Mayumi\u2019s desire to date men, or Shirosaki\u2019s obvious masochism. Yet despite this, the show obviously makes fun of itself and appeals to life in more of a recreational form. Rather than focusing on deep relationships or often dealing with complicated drama, the show settles for a quiet atmosphere with ironic doses of energy. It successfully pulls it off without being dull with this cherry energy and credible realism. Every episode offers something new that explores real life concepts with tastes of eccentricity. A major focus on the show also deals with youth, a reason why Usa moves out of his former home and into the Kawai complex to build a new life. We see how his life progresses with these characters, and although they are depicted as uncanny in some ways can be attractive with their own appeals. \\n\\n\r\nAs the show often likes to have fun with itself, expect plenty of comedy. The word plays and gags are all over the place including its dialogues and references. The personalities of the main characters often pokes fun of itself as well with every given opportunity. Usa, perhaps the most normal resident of the Kawai dorm, often compromises himself with situations that seems to draw unwanted attention. The trollish moments Sayaka plays off and Ritsu\u2019s responses to what\u2019s around are also noticeable. Even Shirosaki gets some attention with the surprising attention of a puppy love crush from a younger character. All these are called a journey towards youth through experience, just like how Usa is living his newfound life. \\n\\n\r\nEssentially, the artwork will probably stand out more as a an appealing technical factor of the show. The way it presents itself feels like a dreamscape with its decorative coloring. The Makoto Shinkai vibe may hit home with its artistic visuals that is glimmering with shimmers. Texts are often incorporated to enhance the experience of youth because people likes to explore ideas, and words are a centerpiece of that. Plus, the humor it brings out is charming. Character designs are also created to illustrate how diverse they are. However, some of them are designed to look stereotypical such as Sayaka\u2019s college girl look with makeup aesthetics or Mayumi\u2019s \u201cmature\u201d body. Usa hardly stands out with anything memorable about him and while Ritsu has charm with appearance, her personality can feel dull. However, her charm can come out explicitly when she\u2019s wearing something decorative or putting on her innocent smile with sincere gesture. On another note, the Kawai Complex dorm looks normal without any glamorous features. It looks more traditional like one of those Japanese inns you\u2019d visit during vacation. What it does have though is a girls\u2019 section where Ritsu\u2019s handy dandy kendo stick lies in wait for daring members of the opposite sex\u2026\\n\\n\r\nCredit to the soundtrack can be given based on two dynamics \u2013 the characters\u2019 voices which enhances their image and the OP song which is well coordinated with imaginative coordination. For voice portrayals, Ritsu\u2019s soft tone comes from the talents of Kana Hanazawa, well known for her work with similar characters. Mayumi and Sumiko also gets some credit for their voices to fit their characters whether they can be sarcastic or intimidating. On the other hand, Usa\u2019s voice is dull as a rock while Sayaka has the mannerism of a fourth grader. Technical wise, the OST is moderate with some moments that are memorable when the capture the expressive responses of the characters or situation. Other times, it almost feels like it\u2019s not even there.\\n\\n\r\nTake this show as a story of boyhood and girlhood. We get a diverse cast of characters in a simple story, rather than multitude layers of love polygons. It\u2019s set in a normal setting without any explicit violence or sex. And despite some of the generic gags going on, the show is a fun experience for its energy. Don\u2019t expect relationships to develop in ways that tell a Cinderella love story. Rather, the show tells stories about youth and growing up with others who are so different. In the Kawai Complex, that\u2019s something to be thankful for.\\n",

            "content": "Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is a good light romantic and little comedy themed anime. The story is very unoriginal, stereotypical and blatant. Nonetheless it's a good romance anime that people can enjoy watching, get a good giggle out of, and feel happy about. Of course, I love almost all romance anime, so if you don't like romance anime, then this anime probably isn't going to be that appealing to you.\r\nAnyways, the plot is very simple. It's about a high school freshman, Kazunari Usa who movies into a boarding house and it turns out that the love of his life, Ritsu Kawai is living there too.The story focuses on the development of the relationship between these two. Basically Ritsu loves books (a little too much), and is easily bothered/annoyed with other people, especially those that talk too much. She really doesn't show any kind of emotion towards other people, and doesn't show any sign of \"love\" towards Usa. Usa basically tries everything he has to get Ritsu to notice him, but sort of fails due to his shyness. But that's where the other fun characters who also live in the same boarding complex come into play! Mayumi Nishikino, a psychopathic, lazy, inappropriate, and drunk lady who loves to make fun of Usa for liking Ritsu, says mean things in front to Usa, but in the bigger picture, is always helping/protecting Usa. Then there's Shirosaki, a perverted masochist, whom I always pictured as a godlike figure in the anime, hehe. That's because although he acts dumb and useless, he's actually quite perceptive and awfully helpful in many ways. And last but not least, Sayaka Watanabe, a \"pretty\" girl who is actually a slut. Pretty funny character though, especially her relationship to Mayumi. All the side characters add  excitement, comedy, and enjoyment to the whole, rather slow love relationship between Usa & Ritsu.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in music in the anime were mediocre, nothing that stands out particularly. But the opening was nice to listen to; I watched/listened to the opening every episode. The voicing didn't disappoint either, each character's voice fit their personalities. The art was very lively and colorful. Very beautiful city, with beautifully drawn characters, I loved Usa and Ritsu's green hair ^o^! \\n\\n\r\nIf you like romance comedies, then this anime is one that you might want to check out. I really enjoyed it despite it's obvious, unoriginal plot. Kind of a relaxing anime, that isn't very serious, and there's absolutely nothing scary or confusing about the anime. Such a cute and sort of innocent anime!",

            "content": "Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is probably one of the top comedy animes of 2014. its a good romantic comedy, slice of life anime that will keep you wanting more at the end of every episode.\r\nthe story begins with Kazunari Usa, a high school 1st year who ends up living in a boarding house due to his parents working overseas. he finds out that the girl of his dreams Kawai Ritsu, also lives in the same complex, but just when he think things are looking up,he soon realizes that his other roommates are anything but normal.\r\nThe animation for Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is rather average, nothingreally sticks out as good or bad. But it looks very good. I definitely applaud the character designs, they are very well-done.\\n\\n\r\nthe characters in this anime are all really different and each have unique stories. The characters are the main focus of the show with Kazunari Usa, being your average romcom anime herione that is always too nice at times and is easy to fall in love. another main character of the anime , Kawai Ritsu, is a 2nd year high school student that spends most of her time reading books and is alone most of the time , who is also very shy and can be quite cold sometimes. Of course you have to deal with stereotypes for the most part, but they are overall a good relatable cast, which have their flaws and never feel too one sided.It's also funny how characters become more likable the further the show progresses. It is evidence of character progression.\\n\\n\r\nas for the music and sound of the anime, it is nothing out of the ordinary Exepct the fact that Kana Hanazawa is the voice actor for one of the main character Kawai Ritsu, which makes the anime even better.\\n\\n\r\noverall i think this anime has a little bit of everything school, comedy , romance and slice of life. The romance was a downer, but that was just a small part of the story so it didn't take away from the overall enjoyment. To this day, I still hope will get a second season, because it deserves one. If you're looking for an anime show with great characters,tons of comedic parts and a solid story line with a mixture of light-hearted and serious moments, then this a good watch. I was very satisfied with this, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",

While it could've been a promising anime, in reality its another anime that doesn't know what it really wants to show and if does something, its usually bad executed. \r\nThe story is nothing special, or why would i give it a 5? You know when there are so many ways to make an interesting plot, anime such as this only put it simple from the very first episode and theres no further developing.\r\nThe Art. Well, i don't see anything awe inspiring, moving on.\r\nThe Sound is forgettable and as mediocre as this anime in general. Can't remember a single track.\r\nCharacters. Now thisis where it is going very dull. Main character is your average Joe that wants to spend his high school days with a girl and thats his only motive. No back story, no charisma whatsoever. The girl, Ritsu, is never developed fully and is just an unlikeable character. The crazy guy Shirosaki is just driving nuts considering he is plain stupid.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the romantic aspect of this anime could be called a relationship, the comedy aspect however is not there. Simply put, the humor is missing. I didn't laugh a single time, not because i don't like comedy, but because this anime and such try to much to inlcude an uninspired humor that only mentally ill people would appreciate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBokura wa Minna Kawaisou is one of the millions upon millions of average shows that hide the real treasures of anime.",

            "content": "'Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou' (aka: 'The Kawai Complex Guide to Manors and Hostel Behavior') is a rather unoriginal anime... in presence at least. Unoriginality though, does not automatically equal 'plain', 'unappealing', or 'bland'. It could very easily, but this show manages to take many things that you're probably familiar with (or maybe even tired of) in the anime-world and present them in a fun, simple way. \r\nStory - 8/10\r\nAs MAL's synopsis covers the show's general plot-line well, I won't reiterate it here. You've seen this kind of setup all over the anime-community. Boy strikes out to 'live alone' and encounters some kind of problem, usuallycomedic or romantic (or both). But, who doesn't like to see something you're used to done again, so long as a fresh spin is taken and originality (as much as is possible within the limited setting such as this) shines through. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is primarily a slice-of-life, comedy and romance. The romance is light and sweet, and the comedy is flamboyant - as it should be in a show such as this. You will definitely laugh and, if romance is something you enjoy, probably swoon. The story is never dull, and also not too flashy or dramatic. As such, the story is very enjoyable and flows well. Though, when the story ends, it just... ends, with no real conclusion (typical of this genre), so watch out for that. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis part will be subjective from person-to-person. But to me, the art was very solid. The somewhat realistic look of the anime was a nice touch. Of course, typical anime flourishes are here: 'oh crap' looks, variations on chibi-like character models for funny moments, words beside the character, giving hilarious looks into the characters mind and feelings of that instant. It meshes well together, the 'funny animation' and 'normal animation'. \\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, everything was nice. No jarringly bad moments - consistency was kept across the whole series - and colors are bright and vivid.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyu all did a great job, though nothing that stands out from any other anime with great voice-work. The music is light and and works with the scenes portrayed and the mood that has been set at the time. No stand out tracks though, aside from the opening and ending themes which, depending on your tastes, could be catchy and fun. They were to me at least.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you read the synopsis, then you have a pretty good idea of what you're dealing with here. For those that didn't, allow me to expand and explain on them (those who did, just skip this part if you want)... \\n\\n\r\nYou have (all tenants of the 'Kawai Complex'):\\n\\n\r\nShirosaki; the masochistic and perverted tenant. The unique thing though, is that there's also a lot more to him: wisdom and compassion. He is actually a deep character, though not that deep, the perverts in anime (almost) never are... \\n\\n\r\nSayaka; The tease, the flirt, especially with males her age (or, heck, any age). Also, the 'frenemy' of Mayumi (who I will get to next). This woman is insane, in the fun-to-watch way.\\n\\n\r\nMayumi; The drunkard, well-endowed office lady with horrible luck concerning men. She loves to meddle and tease, though is nowhere near as sadistic as Sayaka, who she often fights with. When she and Sayaka go at it, hilarity ensues. \\n\\n\r\nSumiko; Ritsu's great aunt and the manager of 'Kawai Complex'. Usually kind and soft-spoken - but, don't disobey the complex's rules or shame the name of the residency with your actions... or else the other side of her will appear. A side far scarier than Sayaka at her worst. Even Sayaka retreats when Sumiko gets ticked off.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, we have the main two: 'Usa' and 'Ritsu'.\\n\\n\r\nUsa; Our main character. Your typical nice guy that's infatuated with a girl. He has a few quirks, but he's not terribly unique. The girl he's infatuated with though - Ritsu - is an interesting character, even if she's a bit cliche...\\n\\n\r\nRitsu; An EXTREME bookworm, to the point of obsession - though it's played off comically. She is shy and reserved, preferring to read rather than socialize for the most part. But once you get to know her, it becomes evident that there's a wealth of personality under that shell of hers. She is a blast to watch when she starts breaking that shell. That is when she shines as a character.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these characters are cliche in many ways, but also unique. At the very least, you'll enjoy some of them. Their interactions with each other are the threads that hold this show together.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis series is easily enjoyable. Some moments may be slightly bland or lackluster, but they are rare. For the most part, you will be constantly entertained and presented with a nice amount of comedy and innocent romance. After all, that's what slice-of-life romance/comedies are supposed to do, and this one does it pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 'Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou' is a nice little slice-of-life series with a romance-comedy vibe. If you are a fan of this genre, then just jump in headfirst and enjoy; you're not likely to be disappointed. And for those on the fence, give it a shot, who knows, you just might enjoy it!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It's cute, and funny romance series.\r\nStory 7: The main plot of the story is a normal highshool boy goes off to live on his own at the \"Kawai Complex\" where it is filled with bunch of, I suppose, \"unique\" people.  He has a huge crush on one of the residents there, who is his senpai that LOVES to read books.  Although I'm not a big fan of the female character being older, I guess this is a exception.  \r\nArt 9: I think theart is really nice.  It's really colorful and matches with the series.  I especially love the close up of the eyes, which I think the art is well drawn. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7: The opening and the ending for the show is cute, and fits in very well with the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9: Oh my god.  The characters are perfect.  Thats all I can basically say.  Each character has a unique personality, and they all fit in very well.  I think the characters are what makes the series really enjoyable and funny.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9:  I really enjoy this anime, it always cheers me up :)  Like I said earlier, it is one of the best series of the season.  It is so cute and funny, I love it XD\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9: If you're really into lighthearted romantic comedies, you should totally watch this :D and I'm really new to this site so sorry if my review sucked...",

            "content": "***My robot friend in the robot highschool***\r\nIt appears that the clever people at the anime industry have finally found the holy grail of directing, a formula that guarantees positive reception regardless of the condition of the industry or the viewers - namely take the latest trends and do an exact reverse. For lack of better terms let's name this new brand of psychological engineering as \"anti-trend\".\r\n***Two day old coyote. Better than three day old coyote***\r\nIt's really dead simple as that. Observe recent cliches and flip them upside down:\r\nCute love interest inexplicably infatuated with a boring protagonist? Turn her into a boyish cold fish completly uniterestedin romance.\\n\r\nPlain boy becoming strangely successful in his highschool romance? Make him completly oblivious to reality and even more plain.\\n\r\nBeautiful girls that would normally serve as harem fodder in a tsundere/yandere fashion? An angry drunk and passive-aggressive bitch.\\n\r\nImprobable setting? Replace with a \"realistic\" everyday life in dormitory.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so on and on. Follow the formula, add good quality animation, some gags and viola Instant hit. Just as long as the devices stay firmly put in the position given and avoid falling in the older, more used cliches the show will earn lavish praise as \"nongeneric\" and \"original\" storming the top page with ease.\\n\r\nFrankly the only reason why the perverted masochist jokes tape player ( it doesn't deserve to be called a character) exist is because Usa and Kawai already play the role of the straight man and it would disrupt the boke-tsukkomi routine. Though admittedly a realistic normal non-pervy character would indeed be a refreshing and welcomed change of pace.  \\n\\n\r\nThere were only partial implementations at this method before (Hagure Estetica, Golden Time come to mind) and likely because of that only partially succesful, so far only Shingeki no Kyoujin managed to utilize this technique to the fullest contributing to the massive explosion of hype. At that moment someone clever racked his brain and submerged his conscience in greed eventually leading to birth of BwMK popularity.\\n\\n\\n\r\n***My legs came back later in a plastic bag***\\n\\n\r\nGlueing a bunch of largely incompatible tropes is the first and final nail to the coffin, all the rabid stagnation in every department can be retraced to it. Make no mistake, it's not the slice-of-life factor or the weak writing at work, it's just that progress can't be allowed. The only distinctive feature and source of popularity is the anti-trend approach, should it take one step away from the stiff design there won't be any difference between every other weak sol/harem/comedy/whatanot in existence and the show would quickly fade into obscurity. Just read any already existing review and it's clear that sticking out like a sore thumb it's only ever mentioned \"redeemable\" feature. No creativity or brilliance to praise, only cynical engineering and pandering. Because that ploy requires to stay clear of other oversued genres growth in any direction is forbidden - whether it's plot, characters, sol, or romance, or anything.\\n\\n\\n\r\n***Metal papers, metal pens, metal hearts, metal hands***\\n\\n\r\nStory needs to progress from point A to B, however for reasons mentioned above that will not happen. Even if we accept the pretext of SOL not strictly requiring a plotline, it doesn't mean it couldn't carry any message, meaning or at the very least show a hint of effort made to make it enjoyable. That applies much more so when it makes any claims at being a realistic tale. I've seen series that followed the \"cute girl doing x\" formula straight and still managed to deliver a satysfying conlcusion, like Love Lab (ironically originating from same author and studios) where protagonist friendships systematically evolved. Hell, even Hyakko and Soredemo Machi which rely entirely on most typical sol cliches manged to humorously ground themselves in reality, playing with tropes constantly to create a fairly unique experience.  Not doing is one thing, removing all possibility of effort is another, and deserves criticism.\\n\\n\r\nGood romance is always accompanied by it's two best friends: interaction and development, and there's neither here. Sempai is nested in her little world up to autistic levels and Usa is completly oblivious to the cold shoulder received regardless of efforts for 8 episodes straight. It's a wonder she didn't press stalker charges against him yet, this was to be a realistic theme supposedly? And the highest point ever reached is exchanging telephone numbers was already a shock. Even it was for non-romantic reasons. Ah yes, she blushes occasionally too. Holo & Lawrence cannot compete with this brilliance.\\n\\n\r\nAttempting to mix in realism along the goofy outline purely for the sake of satysfying the condition of antitrend just made matters a lot worse. With only randomness for randomness sake BwmnK might have slipped away as a lower grade comedy not worth commenting on, but that's exactly the main issue! It wants to escape from certain cliches so it had to be assembled in this hideous fashion, even it resulted in consistency of chocolate spaghetti. When all attempts at profoundness are confronted with scenes where a supposedly 16 year old girl is at risk of getting run over by car because she can't get her nose from the book like helpless small child, or that pervert cardboard throwing in his unfunny broken record everywhere, any maturity is flushed down the drain. It's nowhere near realistic, and trying so hard to be when it absolutely shouldn't only makes it more pretentious. \\n\r\nHorribly pretentious, and the only reason it's being reinforced is because \"realism\" will sell today.\\n\\n\r\nLet's be clear - the writing didn't fail, it was replaced completly with forceful marketing. Any possibility of a story (whether strong or weak) was annihilated on conceptual level. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 1/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n***So they put me in a special clasroom where everybody is a robot***\\n\\n\r\nFrozen characterization is a natural consequence of this fatal design flaw:\\n\\n\r\nUsa - typical bland nice-guy harem lead, only minus the harem. To make his blandness stand out. \\n\r\nKawai (junior) - a cybernetic organism, living tissue over metal endoskeleton. Either that or she's suffering from some serious mental illness that prevents her from behaving like an actual teenage girl would. Aside from two or three moments there's little resemblance to human being, and even that gets reseted due to the damaged learning processor.\\n\r\nAngry Drunk - development and importance = 0\\n\r\n.. and the drunkard theme wasn't funny even way back when NGE aired, not to mention Katsuragi Misato has a lot of depth to her. \\n\r\nPassive-Agressive Bitch - development and importance = 0\\n\r\n..unless emphasizing Usa's sky-high blandness during that one cafe scene can be considered important.\\n\r\nPervert Jukebox - please insert coin to hear gag *BEEP* please insert coin...\\n\r\nManor Owner - typical plot advancement lady, except there's no plot so let's go with Gag Instigation Automaton. Oh yeah, she also blushes (WHY DOES EVERYONE KEEP BLUSHING? Is their blood pressure too high?)\\n\r\nSecondary Harem Girl - if you've been reading attentively up to this point you might ask why she was even introduced if the objective is to avoid certain cliches? Simple - she's there to make protagonist bland nicety stand out more. And to show how passionate is his stalking.. pardon, love for the main harem girl, since complete lack of romantic development makes it difficult  to evaluate the status of the relationship. She's also a fan of stalking, they'd make such a good couple! Aside from fanservice function no more involvement is allowed. Expect for blushing. And stalking.\\n\\n\r\nWith the rest of the cast possesing maturity and relevance on the level of the Chuunibyo Brigade, no one else is worth mentioning. Not much characters as cardboards, only titanium-enhanced for extra stiffness. Adding a MECHA tag to this anime is completly justified, any objections?\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 1/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n***Hyperalloy combat chassis, micro processor-controlled, fully armored. Very tough***\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is up to par with modern standards. Good outlooks are necessary to lure as many viewers as possible for the trick to work properly after all. In fact it's good enough that I've only dozed off several times instead of sleeping through the whole thing. So good that all the frequent blushing made me authentically worry for the cast's cholesterol levels. \\n\r\nNothing outstanding about the sound, a passing grade.\\n\\n\r\nART 8/10\\n\r\nSOUND 6/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n***Basic psychology is among my sub-routines***\\n\\n\r\nYou might argue that entertainment is a subjective matter, and as long as someone enjoys it I've no right to judge it. Well that's a topic for a different essay and a different time, but even if we go with that track of thought I still have a right to have an opinion, as well make make personal observations. I can realise that even with a complete mess of a design delivering comedy should still be possible, yet the jokes fall vastly inferior over the witty thought-provoking banters from Seitokai Yakuindomo or the subtle physical/erotic gags of Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan. I can observe that romance has less development than an average ongoing shoujo manga (and that's saying something). I can see the show stubbornly refuses to resolve subplots (haha plot), for it would be it's own undoing and while not taking any form whatsover, forever intending to cover up irrepairable structural errors with goofiness. And it's clear that the main heroine is not even attractive enough to bear with her dreadful robotic demeanour, and so are the reasons why it must be like that.\\n\\n\r\nI tried to enjoy this but I couldn't. Not even because it's weak or lowbrow, it's the lack of intention to put effort pushed me away the most. I can't stand something that replaced writing with a crude low scheme. Same goes for humor enforcing assumptions that this-or that is funny in a repetitive, intrusive manner. It feels just like those american sitcoms where an artificial laughter in the background is instructing me on when should I laugh. It's very hard to enjoy something that tries to sneak into your consciousness with the subtletly of a sledgehammer, when it could try to catch your attention instead. At every turn, with every antic, every wannabe character, every pseudo-plot point it incessantly reminds me that every single element was artificialy crafted and not a single damn was given, which leads me to only one conclusion. \\n\r\nBwMnK is not anime, but a small scale commercial social enineering project. Cold and impersonal, analyzing thought patterns and programming responses in a creepy 1984 fashion simply screams for a meticulous dismantling.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 1/10\\n\r\nENJOYMENT OF QUOTING VARIOUS POPULAR MEDIA: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n***Do you guys come off an assembly line or something?***\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to predict the defensive responses so to save time I'll take the liberty of shooting them down hard right now. Consider this something like a reviewing FAQ. And be grateful, I'm being considerate enough to save you the effort of writing a pointless rant (and the pain of a migraine for me from reading it):\\n\\n\r\n1) ACTUALLY IN THE NOVEL/ MANGA/ BABYLONIAN MANUSCRIPT..\\n\r\nSource material doesn't matter. Only the anime alone is reviewed.\\n\\n\r\n2) U MAD BRO? WHY U HAETIN SO MUCH BRO?\\n\r\nCriticism doesn't equal hate. And there's plenty to criticise here. Learn the diffference. And while you're at it learn proper English too.\\n\\n\r\n3) THE (insert anime title) IS THE BEST THING EVER AND YOU DUMB FOR GIVING IT A LOW SCORE!!\\n\r\nGo troll somewhere else.\\n\\n\r\n4) U HUV SHEET TASTE THATS WHY U NO LIEK (insert anime name)\\n\r\nSo entartainment is subjective and I'm wrong to rate it, but you judging my tastes is perfectly a-o-key? Logic.\\n\\n\r\n5) YOU NEED TO CHILL BRO! IT'S JUST ANIME\\n\r\nYou've crushed my argumentation completly. All my points were proven wrong.\\n\r\nNot.\\n\r\nAnd stop bro-ing at me.\\n\\n\r\n6) Why did you watch the show if you didn't like it?\\n\r\nA logical question, a truly rare find on the internet. Putting it simply the subject of psychological manipulation is something like a hobby for me, and the more cheap and insolent the device the more fun it's to hack it into pieces. Plus it's popularity was getting really pesky :P\\n\\n\r\n7) YOU HAET IT SO MUCH BUT STILL WRITE A REVIEW FOR ATTENTION U SAD LONELY DISGUSTING OTAKU\\n\\n\r\nI've had tons of fun while writing this review, implementing all those various quotes alone made me grin all the time :)\\n\r\nAnd it's kind of the reverse, it's the show that craved for attention so desperately it's hard to ignore. It got what it wanted :P\\n\\n\r\n8)  YOU ARE WRONG, THE (insert show element) IS ACTUALLY GOOD\\n\r\nWatch some actually good anime, make a comparison and then reconsider.\\n\\n\r\n9) YOU ARE WRONG!!!\\n\r\nNO U!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\n10) LET'S SEE YOU MAKE A BETTER ANIME\\n\r\nIf you really make a comment of that unfunny retardation magnitude you're getting perma banned on my profile without warning. Even my tolerance has it's limits.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on but this should cover the main points. Now you have no more need to rabidly spill organic matter of various origins over my comments page. Give a hoot, don't pollute!\\n\\n\\n\r\n***It's a long walk back to reality***\\n\\n\r\nSummarising Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou has nothing to offer. Design shamelessly set on harvesting trends with no regards for the means crippled all potential right at the drawing board. Everything accomplished was done better in many other titles, be it comedy, romance, sol, realism, harem or even sex jokes with animation. Not enjoyable on the most crass undemanding levels with nothing to praise beside animation quality and only providing a small analytical skills exercise for this reviewer, it's gets a horrible 2/10 overall score. Watch something else, ANYTHING else.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for this new brand of psychologically oriented directing - it needs to be scorched, scattered and forgotten. Anime deserves better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n***all quotes, titles, names etc belong to their respective owners, utilized per Fair Use policy. Parody, reviewing, nonprofit, blah blah, don't sue and all that stuff***",

            "content": "This show was a first for me, it was the first time I read the entire manga before watching the anime. As a result, I enjoyed it far more than I would have otherwise. I now recommend always searching out a well-translated mange before watching an anime whenever possible as it adds a lot of depth to the anime. Its not like it is here in the West where the movie or show versions are adaptations and highly altered. So far, I have found that anime really strives to bring the manga to life and tell the story as richly and accurately as possible, withfrequent nods to story and character elements that can't be covered. \\n\\n\r\nI watched this a while ago and am still following the anime so apologies if its a little vague. The story is a little typical with a boy at the mercy of circumstance finding himself in various flirt-prone scenarios. However, the case of well realized characters also makes this much more relatable to older audiences than most, often moving back and forth between seinen and shojo/shonen themes.  The Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou makes almost constant visual references to the manga which may go completely unnoticed if it is skipped, and is filled with great portrayals of the romance and tender \"youth\" which highlight the series. Its a great comedy romance that focuses on modest and subtle interactions between the main characters and highly extravagant interactions between everyone else.  I highly recommend it and that you seek out the manga first!",

            "content": "Kazunari Usa is a Japanese high school freshman who finds himself living the dream: his parents are out on work assignment, leaving him to enjoy independent life at a boarding house where he cohabitates with his cute bookworm senpai. Unfortunately for Usa, the other tenants at the Kawai Complex prove to be anything but normal. The title \"Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou\" (\"We Are All From Kawai Complex\") is a play on words with the double meaning \"We Are All Pitiful,\" and the residents of the Kawai Complex all exemplify this in different ways. This anime chronicles Usa's misadventures amongst this new group of vexing personalities.\r\nKawaisoufalls squarely into the \"slice of life\" genre. There's no continuous plot to drag us through the series. It is episodic in nature, with each episode introducing a new stimulus for the cast to react to. Most scenarios force protagonist Usa into uncomfortable (often socially awkward or sexual) situations. This is played mainly for laughs, though sometimes we get dramatic character-building moments out of it.\\n\\n\r\nUsa's discomfort serves as the main source of Kawaisou's comedy, executing manzai (the straight man/funny man act), with our protagonist playing the role of straight man and the rest of the household serving as a revolving door of ridiculous antics. This can sometimes feel redundant, however. Because each of the supporting characters is, for purposes of comedy, mostly defined by a single trait exaggerated to varying degrees, it feels like we go back to the same bag of tricks a bit too often.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, Kawaisou's comedy pulls from a fairly large bag. In addition to our straight man/funny man pairings involving the protagonist, the supporting cast members are also able to spin new jokes off each other's embarassing situations. This gives us a good amount of variety in gags, enough to keep things fresh even if some of the beats feel familiar. The comedy hits more often than it misses, and perhaps Kawaisou's greatest virtue is that it always moves forward at a steady clip: even when gags do fall flat, they're in-and-out before they have the chance to get too annoying.\\n\\n\r\nKawaisou's comedy is enhanced by its judicious use of visuals, frequently inserting highly exaggerated and stylized artwork to great effect during gags. Apart from this, Kawaisou's visual direction maintains an idyllic vibe by constraining the bulk of the action to the Kawai Complex, allowing the show to keep a consistent color palette, which is notable for its use of contrast and bright hues. Particular attention is paid to the lighting in each scene. While the animation is passable, Kawaisou is gorgeous within each individual frame.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the supporting cast members start off as two-dimensional, but even as two-dimensional characters, they benefit from being unique. The cast of Kawaisou is atypical not only in the sense that its members deviate from commonly-accepted social conventions (much to the irritation of our protagonist), but also that they're able to confront problems and support one another as a family. Each of the supporting cast members also gets some dedicated time during which the series explores their character, and we get a better idea of what makes each of them tick. These different character \"arcs\" are executed to varying degrees of success, but chiefly, these arcs allow the characters to feel like people rather than props that exist solely for our protagonist to react to. Despite the relative lack of progression inherent in slice-of-life shows like Kawaisou, there is real character development.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Kawaisou doesn't make any radical attempts to innovate within the slice of life genre, the anime is often playfully and refreshingly subversive. Kawaisou is well aware of the ways in which it could be cliche, often feinting toward that direction and misleading the audience before pulling the rug out from under them and laughing both at us and itself.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Usa's \"nice guy\" behavior early on causes him to take a concerted interest in reaching out to his introvert bookworm senpai, Ritsu. In the interest of \"rescuing\" her from what he perceives to be a state of loneliness, Usa cultivates a series of habits which border on stalker-like: he enters full-on appeasement mode and begins following her around doing everything he can to \"help\" her break out of her shell. Rather than reward Usa for this faux-nice behavior, numerous cast members call him out on his behavior, Usa realizes that he's being a bit nutty, and we all have a good laugh at his expense.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, Kawaisou's respecful depiction of Ritsu's introversion is one of the show's more impressive feats. Ritsu is far from the tree as far as the \"shy anime girl\" trope is concerned. She's not anti-social, and she does have it in her to enjoy the company of others, but she prefers to be alone with her books. Ritsu's introversion is not portrayed as a problem to be solved, but rather just one facet of her personality that makes her a bit unusual at first glance without constituting the entirety of her character. Introverts will likely be able to relate and appreciate this.\\n\\n\r\nAlso refreshing is the fact that Kawaisou doesn't beat around the bush when it comes to topics of sexuality, while at the same time refraining from over-sexualization. All of the characters in Kawaisou are sexual beings to some degree, and in the context of the home, none of them seem particularly bashful about discussing it, with perhaps the exception of our virgin protagonist. Kawaisou doesn't use sex as a tool to titilate or arouse the audience. Rather, the sexual aspects of the various cast members serve to further illuminate and color their personalities, and Kawaisou makes it apparent that sexuality is a critical component for each of these characters. Particularly notable is Mayumi, a bitter 30-year-old office lady who is constantly struggling to find a stable man who will respect her, a goal that seems at odds with her own sexual impulses. Mayumi is also haunted by the feeling that she's past the apex of her value on the dating market, and she constantly alternates between jealousy and disdain for younger couples. While Mayumi's constant sexual conflicts are mostly played as a source of comedy, if you remove this sexual aspect of her personality, you lose the character. Kawaisou handles sexuality in a manner that is respectful while still mining it as a source of laughs.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the relationship between \"nice guy\" protagonist Usa and introvert senpai bookworm Ritsu serves as the bread and butter of our story. The story of an overly-accomodating borderline obsessed stalker \"nice guy\" might be a massive turn-off in other contexts, but Kawaisou incorporates his behavior in a manner which is both self-aware and funny. The stoic bookworm who seldom cracks a smile might also look cliched on the surface level, but there's real joy to be found in the story that centers on the relationship between these two. That said, if you're looking for a romance story, you probably won't find it here. Rather than attempting to tell a story about love, Kawaisou tells us a story about a teenager learning to coexist with people from different walks of life.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThis review is written by members of the club Quiet Discourse.

As we now, if it's full comedy anime then it'll never far from unique \"crazy\" personalities from each character, and this show are \"loaded\" of that point. With all those variant \"unique\" personalities, you won't be bored even for just a second. Pervert behavior and echi content are still inperfect portion and enrich the entire show with a bit mature jokes.\\n\\n\r\nBokura wa Minna Kawaisou was also been made with a great graphic and effect. The animation are detailed, smooth, and bright. The design of the character are simple yet appealing. All makes it so fascinating. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the staff there's Hanazawa Kana as the MC seiyuu, Kana chan cute voice's is always lovely to hear, her experience and skill as seiyuu are nothing less expected, not to mention she also sang the theme song for it, makes me gave an extra point. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoy this anime very much, it's really fun watching frenzy daily life like what happened in Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou, I highly recommend it for any of you who likes comedy romance.",

            "content": "Every now and then when I go out of my way to look for a new romance anime to watch, I can't seem to help but to come across the whole anime \"3 in one 1\" genre package where romance comes bundle up with comedy and slice of life/school life like it's one of those 3 in 1 instant coffee packets. I mean it's not like I have anything against the two other genres but sometimes I just want to watch something purely romance just like how sometimes I just enjoy drinking coffee without sugar and creamer. But I digress, this genre bundle seems tobe more common with animes targeted towards male audiences, rehashing cliches over and over again, building an impression that male targeted romance would not likely subsist without being comical, as to \"being in love\" is in the eyes of others, that pitiful?\\n\\n\r\nEnter Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou literally translated as \"We Are All From Dormitory Kawai\" or serves as a double entendre for \"We are all Pitiful\" a foreshadowing for all the word plays to come. Truly the main gimmick of the series revolves around the pitiful love endeavors of the Kawai Dormitory\u2019s claimed abnormal inhabitants, a place oozing of RomComs juices, focusing on the main protagonist Usa Kazunari and his love-on-first-sight heroine, Kawai Ritsu. Now, I'll admit that it doesn't take much for me to set eyes and commit to an anime. Despite alarms going off saying this would be another generic RomCom just based off its synopsis, if the main heroine is short haired, well that's basically my Kryptonite. Make it a short haired girl with a dandere attitude combo, well then you might as well just bury me already. So I lunge towards the series just like how I lunge towards old ladies giving out free samples at the local supermarket. Giving the anime a shot, I thought I could at least go down with a good eye candy but in the end what I got did not disappoint me. \\n\\n\r\nThe story while does not bring much new or innovative addition to the RomCom genre did caught my attention for having the right balance of comedy, romance and slice of life. The comedy aspect was not too overbearing as it does not take itself seriously nor try to capitalize much on the pitiful love ideals of its characters until it becomes irritating as many RomCom had done before. It had enough just enough romantic elements which in my opinion does not alienate its audiences by giving us someone like Usa, to constantly cheer for instead of the common plot-line of directly implying from the start that they could both very likely hit it off perfectly. Every now and then, interference from the other cast does not annoy me as some other RomCom does but serves only to heighten the sweet release should the two ever hit it off. The slice of life aspect of the story is executed somewhat interestingly enough even though there were scenes which are mundane due to the slow progress of the plot and/or character development. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style pretty much within my tastes, character design had hard colours reminiscent of animation style from a couple years back but with slightly more realistic body and face proportions. Soft tones and shades for the background design compliments well with the character design giving enough contrast enabling it to stand out. The occasional anthropomorphism of characters into their chibi forms goes well with the comedic scenes, not over-employing it too much until it loses its original aesthetics. I had sound and music on a positive note as well, with an mellow opening and an upbeat ending, whereas voice actors did approvingly well with their character portrayals.  \\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters had the most impact on me granted the bulk of my score, ranging from a variety of different personalities, each somehow related to their somewhat pitiful love endeavors. Though considered abnormal by societal standards, to me are not we more accustomed to weird characters in the anime scene which makes completely normal people like Usa seem to be the weird one for not fitting in. While the story occasionally revolves around Usa and Kawai, the other tenants do have their fair share appearance and contribution to the series.\\n\\n\r\nUsa Kazunari, the protagonist, the ring leader of the handful of claimed weirdos in his life, is pretty normal you can get and this is speaking on the real world perspective, not those anime definitions of normal. He is as plain as you can get. He does things what a normal boy would do to gain attention of his love interest, which includes but not limited to, trying to get her to open up to him, picking up common interest to initiate topics for conversation and having sexual fantasies. In his position, being a junior going after a senior is pretty uncommon as far as the handful of animes I had picked up. He has trouble conveying his feelings but this is not entirely his fault when he has to deal with such a dysfunctional personality that is of his love interest. He\u2019s the nice guy type however girls do not just fall head over heels for him. He has a predictable personality but what else can you expect from a guy who gets elated over simply seeing a different expression from Kawai. Actually scratch that, I would too, that's the perk of liking a dandere, and the net gain from the emotional difference is truly staggering. Though, Usa often pushes his luck too far, overestimating his boundaries with Kawai, taking far subtle hints and exaggerating it causing for more discomfort towards her than benefits towards him.\\n\\n\r\nKawai Ritsu, the main heroine, on the other hand is very reserved with her feelings though when she gets engrossed with a book she really likes, her emotions starts leaking out. A bookworm and loner in personality, she does not mind being alone as the thought of maintaining social etiquettes with friends and acquaintances could be overbearing. Putting on a friendly persona for the benefit of her friends is emotional taxing for her as such a typical response from an introvert. Though she eventually opens up more towards her dorm-mates or \"tenants\" since her parent technically owns the dorm, particularly towards Usa but this was squandered of course by his own insecurity or interference by third parties.  She may appear stoic at times but she does have her fair share of emotional distress at times as she is unable to cope with sudden social expectations.\\n\\n\r\n Shirosaki, the pervert of the dorm with his overly masochistic personality, would not be crossed out as the comic relief of the show initially. However he is caring in nature and good at tying all sorts of knots but his sexual disposition makes him hard or seemingly incapable to requite feelings of love due to the constant mocking and physical abuse of his dorm-mates. Despite this, he always comes up with entertaining ideas to kill boredom at the dorm. Often his partner in crime, Mayumi, the mature adult woman, has trouble reeling in a keeper due to implicitly implied by the other tenants as being too \"loose\" or easily swayed or charmed. She is unstable in nature, always drinking to soothe her sadness and also has a weak tolerance to other people being happy or having fun without her. Not being one to be left out, she constantly tries to top Usa by foiling his attempt at youthful love with Kawai. Though it seems sometimes she genuine does not want Usa at his chance with Kawai, Mayumi\u2019s actions makes it all the more worthwhile by making sure he actually puts in more effort and not simply resorting to cheap tricks to get on Kawai\u2019s good side. I would take this sort of interference any day rather than the \"best friend whom never get laid\" or \"harem girls\" interference.  Sayaka, on the other hand, with her mischievous and sadistic attitudes may appear to be most favourable among the other tenants in terms of relationship. However she herself has trouble actually committing to one and prefers to ditch them like used tampons. Similar to Kawai, Sayaka has to constantly put up a likeable persona with her male acquaintances which could also be seen literally with the amount of make-up she puts on. Surprisingly she is still a good person at heart, never abandoning her old friends even after moving to the city from the countryside. As much as she toys with Usa, she does help him out on certain occasions, though the former proved to be much more. Last but not least the caretaker of the dorm, Sumiko, who is also Kawai\u2019s grand aunt. Kind but knowing when to get strict and threatening at times, she make sure abuses from Mayumi and Sayaka towards Usa is kept moderately. She has a special rule where she cooks the favourite meal of the tenant for the evening if the specific tenant is depressed. Even though she is elder figure, she can be playful and optimistic at times but ensures that the strict dorm rules are complied by its tenants. Now I did assume everyone in the dorm had some kind of love related issues.  Sumiko may be unmarried given she kept onto her family\u2019s name but I could be wrong. But if this stands true I guess she has a few problems of her own when it comes to her love life.\\n\\n\r\nThis series was thoroughly enjoyable despite initially thinking that the mundane slice of life aspect with eclipse any redeeming comical factor the anime have to promise. In the right amount of doses with well-placed timing, I had a good laugh at their antics just like how I laugh with my real friends. They are not obligated to get to know each other in the dorm but they do so knowing they would be much more entertained putting up with each other than locking themselves in their room (though maybe Shiro would be fond the whole locking idea) Watching this series makes me feel like I too am part of Kawai Dormitory and all its weirdness. Usa despite having a very associable personality does not want to make me embody his character but merely cheer him in his often botched attempts at getting closer with Kawai. Running gags and world play galore, this show is kept going by its cast, ensuring that even a dull moment could quickly be turned into a slapstick gag. While the slow pace of the show might be unappealing to some audiences, the relationship between Usa and Kawai shows how two people with polarizing personalities should not be rush. The series may be trying to portray that it is not their weirdness that is used as common grounds that keeps them together as a unit but their ability to tolerate and overcome each other\u2019s abnormal behaviours. This is depicted as Usa, being the epitome of weird tolerance though he at times thinks it is better to just avoid these circumstances, always seems to be drawn towards it. Pitiful as it is, seeing Usa constantly trying to run away from his fate only to return it is somewhat entertaining to me.\\n\\n\r\nSo in a nutshell, Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou may not be ground breaking in the RomCom + SOL genre, it certainly shows that the formula is still entertaining and engaging when executed properly. I may not have gotten my pure romance experience but it does instil in me the desire to continue observing the progresses of the tenants of Kawai Dormitory. I came for the short haired girl but left with a bunch of weirdos lingering in my mind. So the questions are, \u201cShould I recommend this anime?\u201d \u201cWas I satisfied with the ending?\u201d \u201cAm I barred from my local supermarket?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe answer is \u201cYes\u201d. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

I would place Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou in the top 5 anime of 2014.\r\nStory [7/10]\r\nBokura wa Minna Kawaisou is a typical romantic comedy. Most of it is set in a boarding house. You have the main character, Usa, a seemingly normal male, surrounded by \"weirdos\". Shiro the masochist, Mayumi the woman with crappy taste in men, Sayaka the bitch (lul jk i love her), and the main character's love interest, Ritsu. All in all, it seems to be a rather overused setup. Yet,every week I found myself excited to watch the next episode that aired.\\n\\n\r\nWhat sets Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou from other dorm life animes is how the story is executed. It's casual. It's relaxed. Everything flows so smoothly that it seems almost natural.  It doesn't try hard to force the viewer to sympathize with the characters. Yeah, I'm looking at you, Sakurasou. It's a lighthearted anime that anyone looking to relax for half an hour can enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nArt [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nMy first thought when I saw the artwork was \"shiny\". Kawaisou enjoys exaggerating the lighted areas of scenery and hair. Which isn't a bad thing. The brightness worked well with the mood of the anime. The scenery was stunning and the character art was pretty nice.\\n\\n\r\nRitsu's lips were sometimes too shiny for me, though.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nOutstanding OP and ED. I usually don't listen to OPs and almost never listen to EDs but dang, they just made me feel so happy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the characters are somewhat stereotypes of typical weirdos, they show signs of having more than one dimension of personality. I might have been a bit biased because I love Ritsu's character. She's a great example of a normal, everyday introvert. Her character's not done in an extreme way, where she's either some cold, heartless bitch or a supershy book reading nerd. She's normal. And that's what I think is the best part of Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou. Very well done.\\n\\n\r\nRitsu's laugh is also super cute.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime. It was one of the few series that I looked forward to each and every week. Watching it was a very relaxing and enjoyable experience\\n\\n",

            "content": "'Kawai Complex' is like a blend of romcom, adult jokes, anime seinen elements and wackiness. The main character Usa moves into a boarding house, whom coincidentally meets the girl of his love, Ritsu. Unfortunately the rest of the residents consist of a creepy masochist, a bodacious drunk woman and a backstabbing troublesome girl who puts a mask of cheerfulness to lead men on.\r\nDepending on your preferences, you may either like or hate the characters. But the primary focus is based on the relationship of Usa and Kana Hanaz- I mean, Ritsu; a shy, introvert girl who has a love for books and nothing else. Usaon the other hand is like a kinda a semi-beta who gets constantly teased and cannot read situations for LIFE at times. Their relationship is subtle and not forceful - which is nice - however the development hates speed. It's not like a snail crossing the road; it's more like a truck in a middle of a traffic jam. Running out of petrol.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is primarily comedy, but it has its serious moments. And the problem is that it has difficulties deciding what it wants to be. Comedy scenes are one after another. Other comedy moments are scattered all over the place during the course of the show, which can damage its pace of development at times. There's a few moments where there's no interruption (like episode 8's scene for example), but other than that, the mood gets killed by a punchline or silly occurrence. This isn't necessarily bad in entertainment's point of view, and I can ensure you this is a comedy series at heart. It just throws more cars in the traffic jam, so when you think 'oh wow plot is progressing!'; no, it's really not.\\n\\n\r\nAs a comedy though, it's a pretty entertaining show. But it's not for everyone, and can bring back the bad 'typical Japanese humour'. Lots of pervy jokes, but note this is not labeled an ecchi. It has its hot moments, but it's not immature, which is a change. The characters aren't underaged teenagers surrounded by random boobies in highschool. The ecchiness is actually justified and so the perverted, romantic or older jokes seem more natural coming from the cast suited for this type of comedy. But a lot of straight-man jokes are present, and if you're allergic to Japanese humour then avoid. It's not a big offender though, so even if your fondness of it is low, you should be safe anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no typical tropes of characters like tsunderes - somewhat refreshing - but their tropes aren't really unique either. Their portrayed as what their characters are supposed to be; a drunk woman getting dumped and two-timed, whilst picking on people. A bitch messing with other guys' hearts with a violent nature. And the neck-beard who gains pleasure from displeasing words and pain. They offer a variety of jokes, and they do feel alive at times, but they're not particularly pass 1-dimensional either.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough of the side characters. Usa can be plain, but he's bearable. Even likable at times. The other times is where his thought process passes comprehension. No, he's not completely beta, but he can't read the mood, nor can he tell whether he's ticking off another person  or not. He also tends to fixates his desires way too much and this leads to behavior of density. Expressions go over his head; this can be a large annoyance to some. And honestly, I'm all open to incompetent characters, but Usa continues to have the attitude of \"SENPAI PLEASE NOTICE ME~\" throughout the show. He gradually improves though, so there's that.\\n\\n\r\nRitsu wasn't favoured by me that much in the beginning. The first problem was how lazy Kana Hanazawa was with this voice acting. Just another Kana. Thankfully her voice actually starts to fit her actual character, and I can indeed say it's her most fitting role. This is because Ritsu's nature is quite intriguing, well, if not for Usa's monologues of grabbing HER LOVE 24/7. Despite being an overly quiet character, she's no kuudere... most of the time. Her development is interesting in a way that he deals with situations involving other people, and the way she opens up to particular people has some depth in it as well. But alas, her developing isn't so large either, especially for being the main girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe two MC's relationship is subtle, and it actually has some depth without shoving it in your face. But unfortunately the impact of that development is lost due to jokes and random characters interrupting every time. They overcome misunderstandings, feelings inside of them and expressions, and strengthen their bonds. It's just not very consistent when labeled as a comedy because which one is it supposed to be? Comedy or serious?\\n\\n\r\nAnd well, you can argue it's never meant to be a serious show. I can accept that, but if it really was, like a proper full-on comedy show, then all the staggering development, plot points and serious events that is cut off mid-way wouldn't be present. And it's a shame, because I think it had potential to put forward those perhaps tear-jerking scenes with its in-depth characters. But yet it probably had no potential as well due to the concept of a complex having characters filled with... complexity of strange and weird.\\n\\n\r\nBrains Base took very careful consideration in the animation. Lots of filters for lighting effects were crafted well, and the art is stylized and well-drawn. There's no terrible quality, due to the fact that a lot of comedy remarks goes into chibi mode. Fluid movement, but not many anyway. A lot of the voice actors do well, even in the straight-man jokes, but sometimes the two MC's sound quite lazy. OST accompanies the atmosphere well, and overall the show looks very, very lovely compared to others.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my criticisms, it was a thoroughly enjoyable show. It was refreshing, and at the same time it wasn't. For every unique element and positive trope it made, it took another one down. Kind of like Usa. He gets into lucky situations, only to be damned by misfortune. In the end, I didn't really know what direction this show was even supposed to take, but I can safely say the premise, characters and setting were definitely refreshing and enjoyable to watch. I just wished the show had the ability to blend in both its funny and serious moments, instead of staggering them here and there.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, if you aren't bothered with presented plot elements that are hardly fleshed out properly, then check this out for an amusing romance comedy.",

            "content": "Why do I like this series ? NO ECCHI, NO HAREM; SIMPLE SLICE OF LIFE, SIMPLE LOVE STORY . There is not much love, but there's lots of human to human interaction and understanding of humans feelings and emotions and this is what you can expect from a slice of life story. Genuine feelings. Genuine relationships.\r\ni really liked it because ANIME is ahead of MANGA and i dearly wish to know what happened in the story hence it increased value of ANIME more into my eyes.\r\nMANGA is SETUP in very good city >> Which has lot of monumetal and beautiful places and the same youwatch in anime hence visual treat. &gt;&gt;&gt; KAWAHARA TOWN, GIFU .\\n\\n\r\nART: it has really good art. i can compare it to 5 cm per second in many ways. SENTAI FILMWORKS licensed it and this is why it looked me familiar to 5CM PER SECOND. &gt;&gt;licenesed by sentai filmworks\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: story is quite good . i find MS. RITSU CHAN quite unique and realistic and natural . USA KUN seems the usual male character but he is more wise than others as well as quite authentic. He is quite NORMAL hence attract attention.\\n\r\nrest of the characters are those cliched usual characters . again i haven't read much of romance or comedy having cliched characters but they felt like other characters we all have seen before. still they have their own unique points and stand out and show their worth and value in the story. yes i would like to say they have their own personality and now appear slightly more different than usual characters we see.\\n\\n\r\nMS. KAWAI RITSU CHAN is carrying the whole show. sensible,have feelings show great expressions, beautiful, adorable,cute, talk straight to the point. care about others.innocent and pure. MS. KAWAI RITSU CHAN sooth your heart and make you feel human emotions human feelings as well as humanity again.\\n\\n\r\ncliche in story i haven't found much . again i can't judge much regarding this matter. i am not a fervent anime watcher . this is an episodic series where 1 thing happens in whole episode but many important life lessons you get from it. simple SLICE OF LIFE story which makes it really attractive.\\n\\n\r\nhumour is simple and good.actually this is the ANIME that was able to make me LAUGH much more.\\n\r\nMOST important thing that caught my eye is LOVE STORY having little romance. simple relationship building. natural expressions and feelings. PURE INNOCENT LOVE . FEELINGS grow up slowly slowly but USA KUN is ALREADY in DEEP LOVE\\n\r\nA SWEET LOVE STORY IN DAY TO DAY LIFE .\\n\\n\r\nAgain i am not clear about what definition people think of in case of ROMANCE. if anime reaches far enough into the manga, then you will get 2 to 3 occasions of romance. nowadays even simple interaction between characters is considered romance hence i can't say much about what people consider as romance.\\n\\n\r\nit has LOVE STORY . simple straight and without any cliches . you will really love both MS. RITSU CHAN AND USA KUN . you will love their relationship. now if you have watched many manga/anime series having romance you will become desperate to watch more romantic scenes as well progression in relationship. their feelings are innocent and tender and undefined hence best to watch this relationship as it is.\\n\\n\r\nthe other thing that makes the anime stand is usage of SFX/SIDETEXT which is thrown into the anime to give us more about what characters think and saying and feel giving us more info details and help us enjoy more understand more .\\n\\n\r\nSOUNDTRACK : SOUND : i enjoyed both opening and ending though i liked opening more . music really goes well with story and characters and easily blend and anime much more enjoyment. now SONG lines or LYRICS are really beautiful and completely give us depiction of the story and characters. BACKGROUND music isn't loud . you can feel the music going really well with the flow of story and emotions and feelings of characters. PEACEFUL AND SOOTHING MUSIC\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT : I'm really enjoying this anime. I am too much attached to this series and want to know what exactly happened in series. enjoyed each and every episode and planning to re-watch again\\n\\n\r\nANIME IS COMPLETELY FOLLOWING MANGA which makes it even more worth watchable as well as enjoyable .\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL : I GIVE IT 10 . for such a beautiful story such a beautiful manga and making such a beautiful ANIME.\\n\\n\r\nANIME IS LIVING UP TO STANDARDS AND SHINING BRIGHTLY .",

            "content": "English isn't my native language - I appologize for my mistakes beforehand. I just finished watching \"Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou\" (yeah, I know, it's August and I finished watching anime from spring season... I really don't have enough free time ;| ) and decided to make a short review of it. \r\n\tThis show is one of those love comedies which decided to take a different approach to romance and... failed. At least in terms of that type of romance I was looking for. But let's not rush, first things first. \r\nStory \r\n\tThe protagonist, Kazunari Usa (though I don't remeber a single time when he wasn'tcalled \"Usa-kun\"), is a completely average highschooler. Starting this year he'll be living alone... or so he thought. His mother rented a room for him in Kawaisou complex which, as he quckily finds out,  is full of weird people. \"Accidentally\" among them there is Ritsu Kawai - a girl Usa had spotted (and immediately got a crush on)  in his school's library. \\n\\n\r\n\tNo, there are no sudden plot twists or surprises - the beginning really is THAT cliche. The plot centers on craz...ekhem daily life in the complex and development of protagonist and herione's reationship. As you can see the setting for the story is pretty similiar to the one in \"Sakuraso no Pet na Kanojo\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\n\tUsa's fellow residents drive this show. They're not, by any means, orginal. In fact it's the opposite, but who said that stereotypical characters can't be good? So before we proceed to descriptions of the main couple let  me tell you a bit about this crazy bunch. \\n\\n\r\n\tLet's start with Shiro (short for Shirosaki). He's my  favourite character in this show. Well, that sounds kind of weird once you know that he's a 100% M - a masochist, who's not even trying to hide it. Obviuosly that makes him a source of many gags, but there's more to it - I'd say Shiro is the most mature character - you'll see him giving advices to other people quite often. Also he's the only character who gets to have his own side story.\\n\\n\r\n\tNext we have Mayumi and Sayaka - two girls who seem to be always fighting each other. There's not really much to say about them. Mayumi - ~30 years old, had dozens of boyfriends, but still gets easilly tricked by men; currently single, and veeery unhappy because of it. Sayaka - university student, master of deceiving and manipulating others (especially guys); in short she's so evil she could easily terrorize the devil himself. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe last but not least is Kawai Sumiko - an old lady and a governor of the Kawaisou building who treats her residents as if they were her own children. She's the only one who can stand against Sayaka and win. For most of the time she doesn't get much attention but her infinite cheerfulness and wide smile contribute greatly to creating warm atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\n\tNow it's time for the main protagonist. I should be able to easilly relate with Usa, after all I'm a highschooler myself, right? No. Nope. Just no. I do understand the cultural difference between Japan and Europe, especially when it comes to relationships between men and women, are huuuuuge.Still I find it simply impossible to relate, even just slightly, with a guy who starts blushing and getting flustered just by looking at the girl he likes, or starts crying from happiness because she showed her care for him. I'm not an emotionless bastard, I think it's nothing abnormal to fell stressed when around a girl you like, but still - there are limits to everything. However, aside from that annoying behaviour I just mentioned Usa isn't a bad character. He's a  normal guy and his only trait that stands out is his ability to attract weird people. \\n\\n\r\n\tMost of the time you see the heroine, Kawai, she'll have her nose burried in a book. She pays little attention to the rest of the world (that includes Usa). Thanks to that she developed the hard-to-approach-and-lonely-girl-aura.\\n\\n\r\n\tHowever, if you're expecting cold and dignified ojou-sama with kuudere personality you'd be dissapointed - she's much closer to the shy girls from a typicall shoujo manga. The main difference is that she doesn't fall for the protagonist few minutes after he appeared. In fact it's the opposite - she's stays rahter passive, even after she realizes she may have some feelings for Usa. Therefore times when she behaves more lively and active, even if she's doing something seemingly insignificant, are very precious for Usa. She also gets some adorable scenes, for example the frog costume during the water-guns battle was ridiculously adorable. \\n\\n\r\n\"Romancy-thingy\"\\n\\n\r\n\tI said earlier that romance in this show is a failure. Well it depends on what you're looking for. I've alerady mentioned this anime is similiar to \"Sakuraso\" and that also applies to romance aspect . Unfortunately if I were to give a proper explanation someone would definitely yell: \"Ha, look at his review! It's full of filthy spoilers!\". So yeahh. What I can tell without revealing any spoilers is that there's simply too little romance in romance (geez, that sounds terrible but I really can't think of any other way to put it).\\n\\n\r\nArt&music\\n\\n\r\n\tThe art in this show is pretty good. The colors are nice, characters' faces don't look too simple and the animation is smooth. The only outstanding thing about art were shots of the Kawaisou complex from above - each with different lightning and colors used looked really good, especially the ones during sunset.\\n\r\nAs for sound... even though I just finished the show I barely remeber it. Opening, ending, OST - they were all painfully average. \\n\\n\r\n\tSo to sum up, I wouldn't recommend watching this anime unless you have enormous amounts of free time. It has major flaws but none of them are crucial enough to make this unwatchable. On the other hand if I were to name something what would make up for those mistakes I could say: characters and humor. At the beginning jokes were pretty good, escpecially the ones which were a parody of typical scenes in love comedies, but in later episodes they get weaker and repeatable. That, unfortuantely, also applies to characters (except Shiro).\\n\\n\r\n\tIn conclusion Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is just as the description of the 6/10 mark on MAL says: \"fine\".  Nothing less, nothing more. \\n\\n\r\n\tThis review came out to be slightly longer than I thought (OK, OK, to be honest I wanted it to be half as long as it is now) and if you managed to get the end - thanks a lot! I'd aprreciate any kind of support you can offer. Feel free to PM me, be it about the contents of this review or the use of language.",

I just finished Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou, it was splendid. I loved how the characters progressed like how at the beginning Kawai barley even talked to Usa but as time went on they slowly began to talk more and the love story took air. This anime had a lot of funny moments, which made this a great experience. I specially enjoyed how Kawai got jealous, when Usa's former middle school classmate appeared. For me Shirosaki was one of themost enjoyable characters, he was unique. The art was nice, it was quite colorful and changed depending on the aura of the characters. I didn't really focus on the sound but it gave a massive effect on the anime. All the characters were great, mainly how Usa didn't notice that Kawai was falling for him. The supporting characters were the main reason Usa got closer to her. I must've spoiled a lot. oops. I enjoyed this anime but one thing that ticked me off was that they never actually kissed. I hate when romance animes do this. In conclusion, it was very good. \\n",

This show new exactly what it wanted to be and it did it in full swing. \r\nThe characters are all different in their own way, and the show just wouldn't have been the same if any one of them weren't there. They wereportrayed exactly how they were meant to be, and they never changed throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationship's throughout the show were developed beautifully. Whether it be dealing with friendship, or romance. They were all handled amazingly. In my personal opinion, the relationship developed between Ritsu and Usa was probably the darn near cutest thing I have ever experienced in my life. I've seen close to every single romance anime ever made, but there relationship top's the charts for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty basic and the plot...well I'm not really sure If there even is a plot. The show is basically about Usa learning more about Ritsu and here loner personality. He wants to help her, but he isn't really sure how. \\n\r\nHowever, don't think that made the show boring by any means. The process by which Usa learned more about Ritsu was done in such a real way, yet at the same time it was more touching and heartfelt than anything i have seen in a long time. Usa went to such extreme lengths to be there for Ritsu, yet he knew when to keep his distance when need be.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is beautiful...need I say more. The use of colorful screentones was used quite heavily in this show. It gave it a more simplified look, Yet the realistic style of the character's balance that out. Each character stands out in their appearance as well as their personality.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all. Kawai complex is a top-notch RomCom anime that I would recommend to anyone. even the people that aren't into that genre. So stop reading this review and go watch it already. Oh and FYI, Ritsu is the cutest anime character ever. I'm sorry Taiga, I love you, but you have just been surpassed.",

            "content": "Bokura Wa Minna Kawaisou is one of the animes that I was looking forward to in this spring 2014 season\r\nEven though the anime certainly doesn't have anything that is ground breaking, it certainly delivers what it is expected of it and it is certainly not a bad thing.\r\nSTORY 7/10\r\nKawaisou tells us a story about Usa Kazunari, a boy who will start living on an apartment complex called kawaisou, coincidentally an upperclassmen who he fell in love on first sight also lives there. Of course things aren't gonna be easy as Usa has to deal with the other residences and their odd behaviours. The story premisecertainly doesn't sound exciting and there is a lot of pitfalls that can make this kind of story to be stagnant. But fortunately, the execution of the story and the dynamic of the characters brings a big help in creating a fun and enjoyable story, the romance are subtle but is sweet enough to make you go \"aww\" and the comedy is well thought out and again I can't stress this enough, executed perfectly (if not very well). Not to give spoilers, but I do feel that more episodes would have helped with the story as I feel that the endings are rushed and not satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nART 7/10\\n\r\nThe art style of Kawaisou is not great and to be honest, I am not a big fan of it since I prefer a more \"moe\" kind of art style but that is just my general preference. With that said the art style is not bad and I enjoyed how it sort of compliments the comedy. Some scenes are drawn beautifully while some scene made me think \"uuhh this is a bit jagged.\"\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\r\nI love the opening of Kawaisou and while it does not have any soundtrack that is memorable it certainly has a nice background music, the music are appropriate for the situation and serve as a nice mood maker for some of the sadder or romantic scene\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 9/10\\n\r\nThis is where Kawaisou excels at, every character is well thought out and brings a certain dynamic to the story. What makes this type of genre so good is that you feel a certain relatedness to the character and Kawaisou has more or less done that, Usa the main protagonist is your main archetype of \"nice\" guy but it is not generally a bad thing when it is executed in a right way. He doesn't feel bland or boring and you can feel that he has a \"personality\" and that is a big praise for someone with that archetype. Another thing that I like is how the anime explores the other character traits and personality as a whole and you grow to love the anime not just because a few characters but everyone as a whole. The character development is also one of the better aspects of the anime, Usa is first shown as unwilling to open up to the other residences but as episodes past, you can feel that he shows more care to the other characters not just the main heroine. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed kawaisou, it is not something exciting or dramatic. But it is the pure essence of a romcom slice of life, it shows us how a group of characters interact and grow together, I feel a general sense od relatedness to the character and that is a huge deal for not this kind of genre but every genre as a whole, an anime can have a crisis that deals with the destruction of the world but you won't feel any urgency if the anime cannot make you relate to the characters. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 8/10\\n\r\nAll things considered Kawaisou is a good anime if you want to find something that is relaxing, the romance might not be very showy but it has it's subtle moments which makes it worthwhile if you are only looking for something romantic. Granted it is not perfect with a rush storyline and some episodes does make you feel bored, but it is a rewarding experience and I am glad that it lives up (or gives more) to my expectation. I still want a season 2 though.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm not good at introduction so I will start straight from review\r\nStory:\r\nFrom synopsis many users can estimate the story is nothing original and new. It is told from MC Usa Kazunari's point of view. It's done pretty much stand alone (exept for first 3 episode when viewers are introduced by charatcters), what I like is that episodes are kind of divided in 2 parts which are dealing with different conflict, so story proceeds fast in good pacing.Story is not complex but for lover of slice of life genre that I am still fun and entertaining.  Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is comedy genre anime butnothing over the top so don't expect comedy that will crack you up, I found comedy in anime cute and made me grin but not laugh. It has tasteful emount of fanservice, even girls wouldn't mind it (I didn't). I really liked ending, no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Art:\\n\r\nVoice actors are fitting for characters as well as sound effects. Background music is beautiful. Opening and Ending theme are cute and catchy. Sound in general is really satisfying. The animation is great.The best thing for me were colors and amount of details. I'm not good at art so I don't know terms so I'll shorten this section. Overall art and sound are one of strenghts of anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI guess characters in Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou can be counted as 'clishe', as well as character designes that were already done before. BUT thing that differs this anime from others that have cliche characters is amount of personality put in each character. Every of the Kawai complex residents have complex personality with a lot of sides to them. We don't know much about character backstories, just slite details. Altough at some point I wanted to know more about them. Relationship between Main characters is slow, so for people that don't enjoy cute, innocent romance might get annoyed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThat's the best thing about show. Altough it's bland storyline and main flaw is lack of originality, this anime is really enjoyable, I was pleasently surprised. It's what you call vitamin. That kind of anime that you watch through with grin on your face. I really didn't expect anything big from this anime and got one of favourits for 2014.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nQuality of Anime is (by mine rating system) for 8 but because I enjoyed it so much I scored it nine.\\n\r\nI hope you like this review and find it helpfull~ It's my first one.",

            "content": "It's that time again where we say goodbye to an amazing series that's managed to keep us entertained for so long. Possibly under-rated but without a doubt one of the best Romantic Comedies I've watched in a long time. I always have an eye out for the little gems hidden away in each season and so it seems this time... I hit the jackpot.\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nGive or take these series are either make or break with the pacing of the plot and if it's even worth following. Kawaisou isn't Black Bullet or No Game No Life, with a vastly intriguing story with plot twists or jaw-droppingcliffhangers. That said, it managed to pique my interest enough just by having a shot at the Rom-com genre and finish off with what I would call... A masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is always pretty generic with these kind of series. Comparable to Sakurasou or even Nisekoi. Minus the heavy depth in story, length and throw in a new cast of weirdos and we have the Kawai Complex! Regardless the studios involved really managed to flow everything smoothly into this one package. Ranging from seriously deep-emotional talks, romance and of course the old classic punchlines that nails that's usually picking on a single character.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the timing for some of the jokes may seem way out of place in most cases. Since this anime never really likes to dwell too heavily on an emotional scene before smacking on a joke. Which could put people off in the long run. Usually I would say it would be pretty hard to pull this off and fail miserably. But for the most part these get pulled off very well. Though at times I did wish they just let the scene go to see how things would've turned out in some of the more heavy scenes, which is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9.5/10)\\n\r\nThis is very much a character driven story at heart. From the protagonists to the supporting characters, the characters of the complex each have their own unique personality and traits which helps create that rare atmosphere of being enveloped into the story. While each probably do have their own back-stories, not all of them get explored. Which is also a shame... Since I did want to see how Shiro became such a hardcore masochist in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk more about the characters. Firstly we have Usa the main male protagonist. Though there really isn't anything rather unique about him. He\u2019s just a fairly average guy with not many traits that make him stand out, but still plays his role as the \"normal guy\u201d well. If I had to mention a few things about him though... It would probably be his ability to forgive, his ridiculous tolerance to weird people, (Then again, aren't we all weird?) and his kindness. His interactions with the others is what draws out the comedy and romance from the series. He may be plain and typical but there's nothing wrong with that either is there?\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Ritsu the love interest. She was by far my favorite character out of the series as a whole. I'm pretty sure most who've seen this would agree. She's not your typical heroic, outgoing, popular or sex appealing character in the more recent series that have been released. No, she just stands out with her own wit and charm. I can't quite put into words how amazing she is. She hates being the center of attention, loves reading, typical loner and hides her feelings. Her Moe factor is probably at its highest when she's embarrassed. So many facial screenshots... There's just something about 'Kawai' that just makes her 'Kawaii...' (Bad pun is bad I know...)\\n\\n\r\nIt's generally rare for me to praise supporting characters. However for Sumiko the elder/owner of the complex. Her role of supporting most of the characters with her calm nature, wisdom and humor is what carries them through their difficult times. As every character within the complex has something to mention during their own ups and downs. Sumiko's attitude to Mayumi specifically is likely to have started her passive, supportive nature that she has towards everyone. Since everyone has their own... \"Unique\" aspects that brought them all under the one roof, through her so called \"interviews\". \\n\r\nSo Sumiko really had her work cut out for her. Knowing that she would welcome with both open arms, an unusual bunch of people.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's still the vast broad range of weirdos. As I'd like to go into more depth of every character, there's just too many to go through unfortunately... I mean their's characters ranging from a masochist whom actually is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. A girl whose has a habit of choosing the wrong guys to date. A loli, more girls and... You guessed it. More weirdos.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\r\nThe art is straight-out mind blowing. The textures and colors that were brought into the anime was truly a wonderful sight. During the little skits there are even times of adorable chibi forms with floating text which vastly add to the enjoyment of the show. Props to the studio for making it such a sight to behold...\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\r\nPersonally I thought the OP and ED were great to listen to. They just had this heart-warming feeling every time they started up. The BGM in the scenes was varied. Yet repetitive, but always matched the mood that was trying to be set.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors were truly spot on with their characters. Never was there a time, did I find their voices out of place. Their performances were rather impressive especially when they really needed to express their voices to fulfill their roles appropriately.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\r\nThis... Is what you call a masterpiece of the Rom-com series! I thoroughly enjoyed watching the series, with near to no complaints. It may not be best anime of Spring 2014, but in my list... It's number 1.\\n\r\nSo should you watch Bokura Wa Minna Kawaisou? Hell yes.",

            "content": "This anime was something I watched on a whim on hulu's recommendation. i had never heard of it before and would most likely would have never seen it otherwise. I am so glad that I saw it! This is an amazing anime that is worth a watch. Its only 12 episodes so there is no reason not to give it a once over. Its free on hulu. \r\nThe reason why I liked this anime so much is because it managed to get all of its characters, situations and components working for its desires effect. Typically a male MC living in a house with multiple womenis riddled with \"OOPS\" perverted scenes where the idiot MC fumbles over himself but gets clobbered, incomprehensible misunderstandings due to feelings and the MC being so dense that it hurts. This anime partakes in none of that thankfully. Instead what we get is a MC who, while not super intelligent, is aware enough of his surroundings to not be a total klutz and isn't dense about feelings. The relationship between the MC and \"Senpai\" is perfect for what it is and made me appreciate that love comes in all shapes and doesn't require the conventional formula. Just walking home with the girl you care about without saying a word may seem weird but it works for him and is endearing in it's own way.\\n\\n\r\nThis show really excels at the supporting characters. You have Mayumi who is an unmarried, 30 year old hot chick who drinks and has a huge issue with the fact that she is single. Typical anime stereotype on paper but they manage to make her more memorable with an actual character that made you see that she just wanted to be loved. There is Sayaka, she is deceptively cute. You ever know that person who seems perfect? They are so sweet and nice that you just marvel? Well thats not her. She uses that to facade to entice people in and then plays with them. \"She is a lady spider who brings in unsuspecting men and then feeds on making them do her bidding.\" Hahaha she is very enjoyable. Shirosai... he is Usa's roommate and one of the funnier characters. His gimmick is that he enjoys pain and BDSM and is a major pervert. This leads to some very funny scenes. Typically characters want to AVOID the beatings that the female MCs give them in animes but this guy gets off on it. Awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that made this anime for me were the scenes like the one where the MC is at work at the cafe and has his \"friends\" from middle school walk in with some new high school friends. Basically the new HS friends are total jerks and stuck up... they make fun of him as he tries to take their order. His \"friends\" don't say a word in his defense and just sits there taking it... until \"Senpai\" shows up and delivers a rather wonderful rescue. Then the rest of his housemates join in and deliver some delicious and hilarious justice. \"It's a bug!\" Haha.\\n\\n\r\nOverall... this anime is great for what it is. Sure, I would have liked to see more character development and more of the relationship between Usa and Ritsu develop past what was shown in the last episode... but I feel satisfied. Viritus Signum gives this anime an 8/10. Go watch it!",

            "content": "\u201cI just wanna spend my days in peace.\u201d A quote said by the main protagonist, Kazunari Usa.\r\nBokura wa Minna Kawaisou; or rather, The Kawai Complex Guide to Manors and Hostel Behavior, is one of the greatest romance animes I have ever seen. Although it isn\u2019t simply a masterpiece, it is still a great anime, and today, I\u2019m gonna explain why.\r\nSo Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou\u2019s story starts off with a boy named Kazunari Usa, who didn\u2019t really like middle school, so he wants to have peace and quiet with a wonderful girlfriend, till his wish becomes impossible to fulfill once he enters his new home. Althoughit\u2019s sort of a basic romance anime, it takes this sort of romance theme to a whole new level. As it progresses, the story slightly changes when you; or I least expect it. It\u2019s not a bad thing; it\u2019s a good thing. It changed this romance theme to almost something else that made the story not good, but spectacular. Not perfect, but amazing. \\n\\n\r\nI love the art in this anime; it\u2019s colorful, and it\u2019s also neat and tidy. The art runs smoothly, and the art surprisingly made the anime better. The art is, without a fact, beautiful and wonderful. It\u2019s amazing; no, it\u2019s perfect. The setting is drawn absolutely brilliantly and wonderfully. I have no words for the art, because it is not rough in any way. No matter what, the art will forever be beautiful and fantastic. I personally love the art in every perspective, but that might be just me.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were executed very well. We get to know more of each character each episode, and I like each character; though there are some character that come out annoying at times, they\u2019re also very likeable as well. I like how each character is unique and they all have a different reason for living. I also like the relationships between characters, and I like that because it helps me know more about the characters. The characters are not the best part of the anime, but they are still one of the biggest parts of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was indeed beautiful. The soundtrack felt like multiple miracles mixed into a big ball of feelings and pride. I loved the opening and the ending, since they bring out the pride deep in the song for me, and I like the theme for the music; really fits this anime\u2019s romantic theme. The voice wasn\u2019t bad, it was good. I loved most of the voices of each character in this anime; it matches the character itself, and it helped develop the character a bit.\\n\\n\r\nI found this anime very entertaining. I thought it was weird at first, but as I kept watching, I fell in love, and I asked myself \u201cWhy is it good?\u201d and my mind replied \u201cBecause that is how it should be.\u201d. I like the way the anime is executed, and the story + art + sound = an entertaining or bad anime. I found this to be fascinating to watch, but that\u2019s sort of why it is a great anime; a great anime needs appeal and effort; that\u2019s what makes it a successful and enjoyable piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, I call Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou one of the greatest romance anime I have ever seen. Just because it isn\u2019t perfect/a masterpiece doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad. It\u2019s still one of the greatest romance anime ever.",

It has a lot more to offer than what the synopsis may lead you to think.\r\nStory (8):\r\nIt is a slice of life anime, so there is not really a main story, but it basically follows the daily life of Usa as he tries to get closer to Kawai. Their relationship is pretty slow paced but not in a boring way. It feels pretty realistic even if some events are kind of over the top (but for comedic purposes).\r\nArt (10):\r\nThe artis so beautiful with nice shiny colours that calmed me down just by seeing it. I have nothing else to say, everything is just so well drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8):\\n\r\nThe voice acting was really nice, the opening and ending songs too, but nothing outstanding. Nothing much to say here, it was very good\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9):\\n\r\nThis is the best part of the anime. Most characters are quite original and we get to learn more about them in each episode. Even some of the supporting characters are a little developed, which is great because they are too often overlooked in other anime. The way the relationships are developed is slow, but it just makes everything more realistic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10):\\n\r\nI couldn't wait for each new episode to air and pretty much every moment of every episode was interesting and fun to watch. Some moments were funny, others more touching and I just felt so relaxed watching this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9):\\n\r\nI really liked this anime much more than I thought at first. It is a must watch if you like quirky characters, romance, comedy, slice of life and a setting that is different than school.",

            "content": "tooloong didnt read no spoilerino; its really cute and sweet and pretty funny but you just want to kill yourself somtimes as its frustrating as fuck.\r\nas far as romantic comedy goes, this really satisfies me in manly and mature ways appropriate for a 32 year old single programmer. character interaction and plot is really light hearted and enjoyable. characters were fun and each episode was funny and enjoyable. \r\nthe only disappointment was the characters. they were all awfully 1 dimensional. the author really wasted time by naming these characters as he/she could have easily just settled for \"nice guy, pervert guy, quiet book girl, single-titties,bitch and older-mother-figure-cancer-took-from-me\". there really isnt any more to the characters besides their 1 defining trait. It isnt all bad as the show is a short 12 episodes but if it was any longer, it would risk being stale. additionally, anymore of this shows cockteasing \"will-they-wont-they\" or \"why-the-fuck-dont-they-just-put-it-in-each-other\" of the main characters would have me digging my eyeballs out and peeling my skin off trying to commit sudoku. it was sickeningly sweet and cute, and i loved it. \\n\\n\r\nthe main relationship is progresses at a glacial speed, surpassed only to kimi ni todoke. the interaction was really innocent and pure and some what refreshing. its kind of like when youve been getting off to hardcore tranny bondage porn for a week and your cheeto covered fingers accidently click on a x-art lesbian vid of two really pretty girls mainly just kissing and you get off better than the entire of the last week and youre just like \"wow. the female form is amazing\" it just kind of reminds you of how cute and innocent you once were, and the things you may have thought when you had your first crush.\\n\\n\r\nit was nothing amazing, but thats fine. a short and fun cartoon with a sweet and innocent blossoming relationship in a funny and enjoyable manner. the definition of a good romantic comedy.\\n\\n\r\nits not that obvious but Kana, Hanazawa is best girl.

            "content": "At a first coup d'oeil, this anime might be reminiscent all over of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo with many similarities viz., boarding house, a male MC looking forward to a rosy school life filled with fun and frolic, a busty but beautiful lady, romantic scenes and what not but when you start watching this anime, it will be very much patent that it is nothing like Sakurasou. Do take notice that I am not comparing both these anime. Even though one might find Kawaisou to be similar to Sakurasou when you see the plot and the genres, you will be proven wrong that, thoughthey may have similar themes and genres, they are anything but similar. \\n\\n\r\nThe storyline is the one that you come across in many romance-high school themed anime where the MC (Kazunari Usa) is looking forward to attend his first year in his high school hoping that his life will be filled with fun and joyous incidents and at the same time nicking a girlfriend so as to lead a colorful school life. He hopes to have a peaceful but skylark day-to-day life after his traumatic and fun deprived junior school life. Even though this is a high school romantic anime, the most part of the anime takes place in the boarding house Kawai Complex where Usa finds the very same senior, Kawai Ritsu, who is the daughter of the owner of the Kawai Complex, that he has a crush on when their eyes first met at their school\u2019s library. He hopes to get closer to her and know her better so as to develop his typical teenage crush into genuine love. This is when both good things and bad things happen to him when the Complex\u2019s quaint and queer people with whacky personalities to boot butt in. The daily life in this Complex is how the story progresses with a little dash of high school life added in-between certain episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe main disappointment was how there were scanty scenes of romance in the entire course of the anime. Even if this is a RomCom anime, the scenes revolving around the romantic relationship between Usa and Ritsu were limited although, I do realize for once that it is mighty difficult to add every possible entities  in an anime that follows their particular genres. Also, Kawaisou lived up to its expectations as a RomCom anime when it comes to the comedy part. There was abundance of comedy with the characters cracking jokes that ranged from normal retorts and tsukkomis to adult jokes to situational comedies and to masochistic jokes. The teemingness of jokes and puns was totally enjoyable and is guaranteed to provide you hearty laughter in certain episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization was apt and well suited with the appearance of many weirdo characters. Many examples include the tenants of the Kawai Complex viz., Shirosaki, a masochist who was once a writer but now enjoys stuffs including bondage and masochism. His entire character background is shrouded in a thick mist of mystery. Mayumi is a busty, beautiful lady who has the poorest of luck when it comes to men and is a drunkard. Sayaka is a sly, conniving college student who with the help of her predatory instincts and personality woos men so easily on a whim. Ritsu, the female protagonist is a bookworm who is kind of a loner in her school and noticing this Usa tries to make her feel less lonely. With all these weird-ass characters in the Complex, Usa is bound to have a hectic life.\\n\\n\r\nBrains Base who gave us some good slice of life anime like Natsume Yuujinchou, Isshuukan Friends, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun and Oregairu and many more are once again responsible for the animation production of Kawaisou. The second main talking point of the anime was the animation. The weird and funny faces made by the characters were a joy to watch and were placed at the right moments with apt timing. The animation had a shoujo vibe whenever Ritsu smiles, with all the sparkly stuffs and stars illuminating her already bright face. The tone and choice of colors used when the characters blush was up to the mark. Two of the main attractions of the anime regarding the animation were the eyes that shimmered and sparkled whenever there is an exciting and heart-racing moment for the characters and the lips of the female characters which were endowed with a pale peach hue. It was always a delicacy to watch the characters\u2019 glistening eyes and the rosy lips. Overall, no qualms when it comes to the department of animation as the job was crafted well except for the fact that Usa resembled like a girl when he got shy. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI definitely didn\u2019t pay any attention to the music playing in the background as I was too engrossed in listening to the honey-sweet voices of the characters. The opening Itsuka no, Iku Tsuka no Kimi to no Sekai  by fhana was good while the ending, My Sweet Shelter was even better owing to the fact that the three main female voice-actors; Hisako Kanemoto, Rina Satou and Kana Hanazawa, sung this collectively. Watch out for Kana Hanazawa\u2019s verses.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a reason why I mentioned that the animation was the second main talking point for this anime and that is the near flawless performance of the voice-crew especially from the female characters. From the beginning to the end, no wavering or quivering could be noticed in their voices as they strived for perfection. Ritsu is voiced by the ever popular and young Kana Hanazawa (CV of Kosaki Onodera, Gokou Ruri, Sengoku Nadeko etc.). HanaKana, as she is affectionately called performed perfectly. Knowing that Ritsu is a quiet-spoken character, the variation in her voice was evident. Next up is Hisako Kanemoto (CV of Kotoura from Kotoura-san) who voiced Sayaka in this anime. Since Sayaka\u2019s nature is sly, she uses the cute side her voice to entrap men under her clutches and at the same time she is dark natured and loves to tease Mayumi. This personality was well portrayed by her voice-actor and was a total joy to listen to. Finally, the best performance in terms of voice comes from Mayumi\u2019s voice-actor Rina Satou (CV of Misaka Mikoto). Hands down, this is the best character that Rina-san has voiced till date. The amount of variations that she had to make to her voice in the very same episode on many instances was sky-rocketing. At one point, she is this uber-beautiful lady who is going on a date and the very next instance, she becomes this drunkard after coming to know that she is being three-timed and at another instance, she is this dark devilish person who wants all the couples in this world to end up in eternal misery. Mayumi shares this beautiful repertoire and camaraderie particularly with Shirosaki aka Shiro with whom she accompanies on jesting all the other characters. Their relationship and friendship is a noteworthy one. Overall, a flawless performance by Rina Satou who always provided ear sex in voicing this unbalanced, multi-personality carrying bombshell of a crazy-ass character. I always tend to drag a paragraph to a huge extent when it comes to the voice-acting part and this is no exception as I am very much interested in voice-crew for almost all the anime that I watch. Apologies, if you felt that this paragraph was too long to your liking.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nAn enjoyable, fun loving anime that never shies away from jokes and comedy. Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou also consists of some proper romance scenes even if the scenes in itself are scanty. There are episodes that provides a secernment that it also carries slice of life in its 12 very gratifying episodes. Some disappointments include less romance, less number of episodes and inconclusive ending. Other than that, this is a very good Spring \u201914 anime that can be watched by all audiences except for those who detest RomCom and slice of life. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n",

He wanted to have a normal teenage life and just enjoy being a student. Well, you can never get things the way you want it, most of the time. This series shows how troublesome life can get, how how relationships between human are formed, how trust follows. The romance is slow pace but the comedy attached to this story is really funny. This feels like watching Kimi ni Todoke buta lighter one. Such story that is pure and cute and a big plot is not needed. It's just a daily routine and everyday life in a complex with different kind of people. Complicated but fun, troublesome but lively. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nMost characters of the story is kinda unique but somewhat surreal. It will be really awesome to find people with the same personality as theirs. It is interesting how the protagonist of the story change bit by bit but doesn't change at all, a loop of stepping forward and turning back, and the other one does not mind at all. Because he likes her the way she is and its really cute. His will to become part of her life is just too beautiful to see, the way he looks at her and care for her, the way he try and attempt to talk to her, the way he melt by her stares, you will want for more. \\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation: 10\\n\\n\r\nI can't count how many times my jaw dropped by the expression of the characters in random scenarios. It's way too beautiful and full of feelings. How the eyes are being portrayed are really something. It tells you what the characters wanted to say, and what the characters are feeling. Apart from that, the opening and ending songs are really great. It is like being drawn to the story itself. You will get to enjoy and change your current mood to being energize and happy by listening to it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nDid I already say I laugh so hard? I really do. Funny people are the ones acting normal but they are not. It is like them. It is like they really don't intend to be funny but they end up being one, and that is the most laughable at all. The unexpected flavor of sweetness and romance just added interests on the series and it makes it really enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nEnding: 8\\n\\n\r\nPoor boy, oh poor soul. The series just end and all you get is her number and email address. Well, isn't that really cute? I think, I just watch a prologue of an anime. It's just starting to bloom, but it ended real fast. What do I expect from a good romance anime? Most of them does not end by a mere 12 episodes. It needing growing and development. It takes time.",

            "content": "This show was moderately enjoyable, but also significantly frustrating. It's supposed to be a light-hearted romantic comedy, but it's really inconsistent when it comes to establishing atmosphere (often ruining it in order to make an unsatisfying joke). It's also way over the top when it comes to stuff like blushing or close-ups.\r\nMy biggest problem with this show is the cast of characters. Most of the show takes place in the dorm where the main character lives alongside a few more people. Most of these people are badly designed/executed. The protagonist himself is nothing special, but perfectly alright. Some of his character traits made him occasionallypainful to watch, but he generally gave off the feeling of being an actual human being, which I liked. Same goes for the main female character. As for the rest, I was left with an intense feeling of frustration. The other residents of the dorm include: a guy with 0 character depth whatsoever and a role of being a walking joke (usually a bad one), two evil bitches that are contenders for worst human beings in history and genuinely enjoy destroying the happiness of others (yet for some reason everyone puts up with them), and a granny that's not bad, just uninteresting. There are also several minor characters, who for the most part are decent.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is nothing special, but that's really not a problem. The plot is carried along decently, there's no problems such as incoherence or nonsense. The humor is somewhat disappointing, though, which a big reason this series doesn't hold up to my expections of a light-hearted rom-com.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is generally great. The music is fine, nothing special. The art is somewhat weird. Things generally look fine to good, but as mentioned earlier, there's a lot of over the top blushing, (failed) emotional close-ups, etc, during which the art seems a bit out of place.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this anime left me personally frustrated, I believe most people would enjoy it. I think a lot of it depends on how much you are willing to put up with the evil bitch characters (if you actually like them, I suggest a visit to a psychologist). Other than that, you should be fine. I suggest watching a few episodes in order to see if you appreciate the character interactions and the humor, then decide if you want to finish it.",

If you plan to watch this anime, then make sure to watch the special episode \"Hajimete\", otherwise the story won't be complete.\r\nBokura Wa Minna Kawaisou in a sentence is a mood refreshing anime. If you are exhausted after watching an intense anime, then this anime will do the job. It has comdey, romance, spice of life. But nothing is intense. It is a charm in its own.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\n-\r\nThe story is about the everyday life of the five residents at Kawaisou Complex. Everyday they are fighting, arguing, joking, making fun. Thecomdey is good. There is a slow pace romance building throughout the anime between Usa and Ritsu. It was fun to see. Again, nothing intense.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe art was really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe sound was well matched.

Not much character development except for Usa and Ritsu.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nEnjoyed it from first to last. It's far better from many boring spice of life animes out there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nGood enough to be rated 8.",

            "content": "Japanese name: BOKURA WA MINNA KAWAISOU\r\nEnglish name: THE KAWAI COMPLEX GUIDE TO MANORS AND HOSTEL BEHAVIOR\r\nSPOILERS FREE REVIEW \r\nThis anime has no particular deep plot like most comedy types, just a High School boy Kazunari Usa and his wish to live a normal independent high school life (like that ever goes well in a school genre) and there's a Senpai he wants to impress as well. \r\nOne thing that literally shines bright in this anime is the AMAZING ANIMATION, I haven't seen many animes but I'd say that the animation style itself goes hand-in-hand with the flow of the anime, looks colorful, detailed, cheerful andoverall GREAT. Keep in mind this is an anime from 2014.\\n\r\nThe simplest of expressions have so much details in them. The character design are also well made. \\n\r\nThe music played along with the romantic and comedy scenes are very much in sync and adds more impact to the scenes themselves. \\n\\n\r\nOk, word of advice this anime looks cute and all but damn does it throw some unexpected heavy mature comedy. Though the comedy itself is genuine with little to no generic same-old stuff that you'll burst out laughing unexpectedly. This is a very nicely done rom-com with hilarious romantic scenes to heart warming comedy (wait, I got that backwards, ah well...) \\n\\n\r\nOne of the things after the animation in this anime that I loved was the uniqueness of the characters and how well they were mixed together. And given a good amount of screen time to give each one enough time to shine so that the viewers get to know more about them. \\n\r\nWe have the pervert masochist, the drunk office lady with literally no luck with men, the sadistic college girl... (yeah, I did mention unique didn't I?) The loving old manager lady and the shy book loving Senpai. \\n\\n\r\nAfter getting to know his fellow tenants Usa decides to go find another place (I mean who wouldn't... They crazy) as he's leaving he runs into the Senpai and, lo and behold she's already living there (guess ya know what he decided next)\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, imo this is an anime where \"notice me Senpai\" is done right in a very cheerful and hilarious way.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this if you're looking for a GOOD HAPPY watch because from the animation to the dialogs it's one BIG HAPPY ride. \\n\\n\r\nGENRE: Comedy, Romance, School, Seinen, Slice of Life.\\n\\n\r\nRATINGS: I'd give it 8.6/10\\n",

            "content": "Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou, or the The Kawai Complex Guide to Manors and Hostel Behavior, is a very recent addition to the slice of life genre.  While there were problems with it on the distribution side, (Because for some reason, it took days for the damn show to be subbed!), this show was a show that was very worth its time.\r\nStory (7.34/10):  The story of Bokura, as I call it, revolves around the life of Kazunari Usa, a new first year student who begins his life as a first year in high school, away from his parents, at a nearby boarding house.It is there that he finds that the girl that he likes at school, named Kawai Ritsu, is one of his roommates at this boarding house, prompting him to begin his journey of high school romance, one step at a time.\\n\\n\r\nNow, we've all at one point or another have seen this sort of story in various kinds of slice of life's.  A new person stepping into a new world that he must now try and adapt to.  (Working!, Chuunibyou, Dog Days, etc.)  What makes this story different from any other, is really nothing when you get down to the concrete part of the show.  As a base idea, Bokura doesn't differ much from a good chunk of other shows.  So what makes this show better/unique?  Well, it's their comedy and tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nBokura wa Minna does a very good job at giving off a very, very, very relaxed tone to the show.  Nothing really feels serious in the grand scheme of things, and for the most part, the show really just shows the characters having a good time, and enjoying life as much as they can.  It's this relaxed tone that makes the show so good-feeling to watch, and overall, a very good experience.  \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy of the show is also quite excelling too.  The show itself is quite heavily character-based, and shows that with the colorful characters that it has.  The show never takes itself too seriously and tosses in jokes and other forms of sarcasm, comedic desperation, and other forms of moments in which some are actually quite memorable and provide a good laugh.  \\n\\n\r\nThere are however, some downfalls.  Depending on what kind of story you want, this can be seen as a good or a bad point.  The show has a strange cohesion feel to it.  Some things and plot points carry from episode to episode, while others are random and appear for only one episode.  In short, the show has a mix of one-shot episodes that focus purely on one thing, and are resolved later, and others are plot points that span from one episode to the next, to the next.  While personally, I never minded the fact that some episodes were smack dab in the middle of something new, it is something I felt like bringing up.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing about the story that made it a bit meh, is its end.  To put it bluntly, the show is incomplete.  The way it ends feels like that something new has begun rather than resolved.  While the main focus of the show has taken a step forward, it didn't feel like a real ending, leading me to believe that there will be a second season, in which I am not sure of.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Great comedy\\n\r\n+  Wonderfully calm and pleasant tone\\n\r\n+  Simple idea\\n\r\n-   Some cohesion issues between episodes\\n\r\n-   Incomplete ending\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.79/10):  For any character driven anime, the characters of course, are very important.  They have to have a very memorable personality, quirks, and design for people to remember.  While the characters in this show didn't fill in that last category, the first two are certainly filled to the brim.\\n\\n\r\nUp first is Kazunari Usa, our main protagonist.  From the beginning to the end, Usa is shown to be basically your average boring protagonist of being kind to everyone, having 1.5x the amount of common sense than everyone else in the cast, and just generally being, well, normal.  Not that there's anything wrong with his character, since his quest for love is admirable given his obstacles, but compared to the other characters, he's the least memorable of the bunch.  (He is still quite memorable nonetheless, as we do get a decent amount of backstory on why he is the way he is.)\\n\\n\r\nKawai Ritsu, or Ricchan as everyone in the series calls her, (except Usa, who says Senpai all of the time), the main female protagonist of the series.  From her debut, it is apparent that she is a fan of reading.  Well, that's an understatement.  For essentially 75-80% of the screen time she gets, she is holding a book, either reading it, hugging it to her chest, or picking them out to read.  To put it bluntly, she loves books like Keima from TWGOK loves visual novels.  Over the course of the series, we, the audience get to know more about her character and see her grow as a person altogether as she tries to step out of the shell that she has confined herself in.  You learn a good deal about her, making her character all the more developed and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nNext is Shirosako, or Shiro, as he is known in the series.  This guy is a masochist, and if you've ever seen MM, then that is essentially what you're going to see.  This guy is literally the only other guy in the series next to Usa that you will care about, since his character is actually quite interesting.  Outside of his masochistic nature, (which essentially makes up for every joke he tells more or less), he is shown to be a rather helpful and caring guy, helping out everyone as much as he can and has some pretty good ideas on occasion.  \\n\\n\r\nNext is Nishikino Mayumi.  Ah, Mayumi.  She is basically the desperate 20 something year old, that has big boobs.  Her personality is quite interesting, seeing how most of the time she acts like a teenager than a grown woman, attempting to pry into Usa's love life and trying to make him seem like a pervert rather than anything else.  While I'm not a huge fan of desperate females in animes, (quote Becki from Nourin.  *shudder*), I find her quite an interesting character as on occasion, she does help to add to the plot while adding her own spin of comedy into the grand scheme of things.\\n\\n\r\nNext is Watanabe Sayaka.  This girl is terrifying.  While her introduction to the series is a bit late in comparison to everyone else, she definitely makes a lasting impression as being a bit of a sadist.  She in conniving, very luring, and overall, basically teases everyone on who and what they are (mostly Mayumi.)  That's essentially what she does the entire series, and she plays that comedic part very well.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the owner of the Kawai complex, Kawai Sumiko.  This woman is quite an interesting character.  While for the most part, she acts very laid-back and calm, she, has a dark and terrifying side that has many times, terrified the residents of the boarding house.  And also at times, she will do whatever she can to get things she wants, such as making Usa take a job in exchange for tickets to something.  \\n\\n\r\nApart from these 6, whom I see as being the main characters, we have a whole slew of other oddball characters.  Some of which, are quite memorable in the series, while others sort of just fade away.  What I like about this series is the fact that the overall cast isn't so large that you would forget one person or another.  It really focuses on the people it does have and makes them as good as they possibly can be.\\n\\n\r\nOn their own, these characters sound quite bland; nothing really seems too exciting.  But, when you put them all together, the result, is magical.  This series really puts emphasis on its characters by making them talk and interact with each other in many different ways.  It is because of these interactions that the plot is enjoyable to watch, it is the reason that this series has great comedy, and is the reason why the show is so light-hearted and good.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Memorable cast\\n\r\n+  Very good character interactions\\n\r\n+  Decent sized cast with some emphasis on everyone\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (9.32/10 and 7.49/10):  The art in this show is just staggeringly amazing.  Every single scene of its normal animation look quite stunning and just so good. \\n\\n\r\nThere are two forms of art in this anime.  One is the standard animation, and the other is a comedic chibi animation.  Like I have said before, the normal animation of the show is just breathtakingly beautiful.  Everything from the characters to the backgrounds looks stunning.  If you don't believe me, just watch the five minutes of the first episode, and you'll see what I mean.  (The last time I saw something this good was in Nagi no Asukara.)  \\n\\n\r\nAside from that, the show has a very simple chibi animation in heavy contrast to the actual show's animation itself.  For starters, there is little to no detail in the characters in the chibi animation whereas there is heavy detail in the designs of the characters in the normal animation.  While I don't find any problems with the show intertwining its animation styles by putting both of the animations in the same scene, sometimes, the transitions from one style to another happen rather sudden and sometimes awkward.  But for the most part, I'd doubt anyone would really care.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of music, I find the opening and ending tracks to be relatively memorable.  The opening is a very instrument heavy piece that gives off the show's casual and calm feel to it.  Personally, I sat through the whole of the opening, as I enjoyed it very much.  On the flipside, we have the ending, which to me, I also found enjoyable, but not as memorable.  Sure, the tone of it sounded cute, quirky, and relatively nice sounding, but I didn't feel as obligated to listen to it as I did with the opening.  The tracks in the show itself were mostly just background tracks, so nothing really stood out.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  FANTASTIC ART\\n\r\n+  Good comedic chibi art\\n\r\n+  Good opening and ending\\n\r\n-   Some awkward art style transitions\\n\r\n-   forgettable background tracks\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (8.45/10):  I love a good slice of life.  Whenever I want to watch something that isn't too serious in its plot, I watch a slice of life.  This show definitely proved itself as a good choice.  Aside from the distribution problem where I had to sometimes wait five or so days for the english subtitles release, this show was a very good experience to watch.  It never had a serious tone with itself and made itself known to have probably the lightest tone that I have seen in anime in a long time.  It was just good, classic fun that showed that you're never too old to have fun.  If you want to watch a good slice of life with a very minute romantic subplot, this is a good show to watch.  Personally, I enjoyed it a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: (8.31/10)",

            "content": "As the end of the year draws closer, I've found myself in a position where I want to get caught up on the year's more popular titles as soon as possible. Unfortunately, that also means watching shows of very similar genres back-to-back. It's not that I end up getting sick of the genre, but moreso that the faults with each series become more glaring than they normally would if I hadn't watched something from that genre in the while, and the most frequent genre suffering from this is the romantic comedy. So, did my mostrecent viewing manage to make itself stand out from the crowd that's begging to make it into my lineup?\\n\\n\r\n          Once again, I find myself in the position of having to judge a show primarily on its comedy, a process that's rarely ever less than 100% opinionated. As for Kawai Complex, I did end up laughing quite a bit throughout the series. From rampant sensual fantasies to hard-hitting slapstick, this series employs a wide variety of humor. Unfortunately, it ended up settling into a comfort zone about halfway throughout, and I actually ended up being able to predict what was going to happen. Here's the bit where Shiro wants to be abused. Here's the bit where Mayumi blows her top. Here's the bit where Sayaka acts like a horrible person. Predictability is the number one killer of comedies, and I found myself laughing less and less as the series progressed.\\n\\n\r\n          Fortunately, the series isn't entirely a comedy, and there's a lot of character-motivated story lines that get fleshed out quite a bit. While Usa does turn out to be a fairly typical \"I have a crush on the main love interest but I'm nervous about trying to get close to her\" character, he still ends up being really smart about it, and it's hard to not end up really liking him when his mistakes are those that we have to deal with in the real world all the time. Am I forcing myself on the girl I like? Am I being too nice to this group of people? How can I improve my relationship with this person? He definitely felt like he was close to transcending \"character\" and turning into someone that felt very real.\\n\\n\r\n          Ritsu also felt like much more than a standard character type, and she was easily the most interesting character in the series. Her standout feature was that she loves to read and gets intensely engrossed in whatever book she's reading, so much so that she won't even notice when someone else is talking to her. While loving books feels like an acceptable excuse for this character to exist, she ends up going well beyond that, and we slowly get to see the extremely fleshed-out introverted nature of someone who gets exhausted from trying to keep pace in social situations. As for a blossoming romance with Usa, the progression is rather slow, but the signs of it are definitely there, and following this progression make marathoning this series infinitely more enjoyable, though I will say that there were a few points where the writing really felt like it was trying to force this relationship to happen when it didn't need to do so. The slow build was there, but there were definitely points where it felt like it was rushing to get somewhere that it didn't need to get to any time soon.\\n\\n\r\n          As for other characters, they ended up not getting as much fleshing out as I would have liked. Shiro is a masochist who's a lot nicer than he seems, Mayumi is a slightly older woman struggling with love, Sayaka is the mean-spirited two-face, and all of them only get one episode each all to themselves. Plus, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of their comedic cards end up getting played far too often, sometimes to the point where I didn't even want them on-screen because I knew they would ruin any romantic tension that was building between Usa and Ritsu.\\n\\n\r\n          The animation was produced by Brain's Base (D-Frag!, My Little Monster), and this series definitely lives up to the reputation that this studio has been building over the years. Set designs were always a touch more elaborate than average to bring each environment to life, character designs were significantly more refined than the standard fair but still maintained some level of moe-ness, and Ritsu is seriously one of the cutest-looking characters I've seen this year in practically everything she does, a quality I found extremely important when showing a scene from Usa's perspective. There were also a ton of different oddities in the animation used for comedic or cinematic effect, from shrinking an entire frame into the center of the screen to bizarre lighting effects and character design morphs. Additionally, while I normally don't draw attention to this, I do want to point out that the opening animation is actually a bit awe-inspiring, as it seems to provide a glimpse into Ritsu's world of literature and her immersion in it.\\n\\n\r\n          There is currently no dub for this series, but if one were to be produced, it would most likely be done by Seraphim Digital. However, on the subject of original Japanese casts, both this series and Nagi no Asukara have convinced me that I need to start keeping track of how many times Kana Hanazawa (Ritsu) shows up in something that I'm watching. I believe Kawai Complex brings me up to 25 roles that I've heard her play now, and I'm certainly not getting sick of her any time soon.\\n\\n\r\n          The soundtrack was composed by Akito Matsuda (Baka and Test; Love, Chuunibyou, & Other Delusions), and he ends up doing what he normally does: wacky and crazy tracks for comedic moments and softer piano melodies for the more emotional scenes, though nothing in particular really stood out. The opening theme \"Itsuka no, Ikutsuka no Kimi to no Sekai\" was performed by fh\u00e1na and opens with an upbeat pop track, while the ending theme \"My Sweet Shelter\" was performed by the lead female voice cast and play us out with a bouncing pop tune guaranteed to get stuck in your head.\\n\\n\r\n          Ultimately, while Kawai Complex certainly was one of the better comedies I've seen this year and the romance felt very natural for the most part, a comedy that ends up being incredibly predictable by the time it reaches the second half isn't something I can recommend actually purchasing.",

This is the type of anime where they get you attached to every character for every single character trait for what they're worth. \r\n-Plot\r\nThere's not much of a plot to follow, so if you're into adventure and action anime as a top genre, you may feel a little left out on this one.  (6) \r\n-Art\r\nThe art is quite surreal but still the classic anime style we all know and love. It flips between realistic-ish and cartoon-ish similarly to Sora no Otoshimono, butnot quite as frequently (9)\\n\\n\r\n-Sound\\n\r\nThe music gives nice support and the sound effects (which aren't a common use) work nicely. (8)\\n\\n\r\n-Characters\\n\r\nEveryone is emotionally, physically, personality-wise different in some way. All of the characters are lovable, even if you hate them at first. It's like getting a desk change in school and sitting next to someone you don't know but you think you already dislike them but end up good frieids. (note, in the end of the latest episode at this time (episode 7) they give a hinting toward a new bunch of characters)  (10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is the type of anime I absolutely love. Everything about it just works for me.\\n\r\nIf you've seen Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, it's very similar to this anime in the way it is, except in Sakurasou all of the cast has some sort of talent in a way or another.\\n\r\nIf you like animes with great character development, this is meant for you.",

            "content": "When you\u2019ve been watching anime for a certain amount of time, things might start to look the same, in not so kind words, you just feel like you\u2019re watching the same thing over and over. In those occasions, if you honestly feel like that, you\u2019d better just drop the damn thing and be done with it.\r\nWhy start with such statement? Simple, because a series like The Kawai Complex Guide to Manors and Hostel Behavior feels like one of those\u2026 and at the same time it doesn\u2019t.\r\nSeveral washed out stereotypes can be expected, and maybe most of them may be applied in this case\u2026 so whydid the series stood out for me? The answer is simple: I bought the premises in it. \\n\\n\r\nThis deserves and explanation\u2026 here it is.\\n\\n\r\nEven if we can\u2019t see beyond the first impression, and the oh so rehashed characteristics, there\u2019s always something else to be found by the ones who desire to do so, in this case is the ever so important relationship between Kawai and Usa, to be precise, is how we see the relationship itself. We can doubt Usa\u2019s motives to build a relationship with Kawai, and fall into the classic archetypes of anime relationships, this being the romantic soapy kind, or the most sexualized ecchi kind (both portrayed in the series by standardized scenes), and leave it at that, if we choose this judgment the series falls short on being anything else, but if it catches us in that sweet moment where anything might just for a moment seem special, I promise you you\u2019re in for a sweet ride\u2026 that\u2019s me being clich\u00e9d.\\n\\n\r\nThe point is that there\u2019s nothing really new in this anime kind relationship, but at the same time there\u2019s a tiny space where we are allowed to believe in the honesty of its premise. It\u2019s ironic because the series itself is happy with not giving anything new, you have all the classic weird comedy moments were outspoken linear characters do and react the way you expect them to, the defying moments where the hero most prove the strength of his already established resolve, and of course those awkward romantic moments were, In the classic anime way, the characters bond in a way that seems credible only for them in that moment. Any one of the mentioned situations can be easily found in similar works, but there\u2019s something about the way they are portrayed this time that makes them so much credible and relatable.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t really say anything, or give any particular examples of scenes that gave me this unique vibe, without spoiling the damn thing, in the end you have to test it for yourself. At least, trust me in this, it won\u2019t take long for any seasoned anime spectator to either hate the series or love it, in that sense, if said experience exists, it is a constant that keeps da feels going for all the duration of the series.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it was just me, in said moment, that just saw in the drawings and in the weird colors used on the series something else. Say put your own expectations in a fictional work, and maybe in this occasion it\u2019s me the one that\u2019s being selfish in the interpretation, maybe unfair with the creators, I don\u2019t know, but isn\u2019t that the point? Taking the content for yourself? Believing in the honesty of such apparently repeated \u201cfeelings\u201d?\\n\\n\r\nI really don\u2019t know, what I do know is that The Kawai Complex Guide to Manors and Hostel Behavior got me believing in the honesty of closeness beyond the weight of all the social stereotypes, and in the possibility of seeing human relationships beyond the norms in spite of said norms weight\u2026 and most importantly, beyond all the weight of anime clich\u00e9s.\\n\\n\r\nFor those brief chapters I was a believer.                                                       \\n",

All the encounters with the two main characters are enough to satisfy your hunger for romance but won't give you too much to stop watching. And the supporting characters add to the comedy to make it an all round winner.\r\nI love the amazing artwork with the added touch of beautiful colours andshining surfaces here and there. I also love the chibi-like narrations when the main characters are discussing or imagining something in their heads. I also love that when characters are enjoying something you'll see an aura of flowers or if they are depressed a great big purple aura around them. It makes communicating feelings of not so eccentric characters a lot easier and often adds to the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters fit into the common stereotypes found in anime and act accordingly, which again adds to the humor, and as the story progresses you cant help but fall in love with each and every one.\\n\\n\r\nThe beautiful OP by fhana fits perfectly and every time I watch an episode I can't help but listen to the whole thing. The sound during the episodes isn't annoying like some animes and fits so perfectly that you barely notice it. \\n\\n\r\nAll up, I highly recommend this anime to anyone who wants a refreshing change and love slice of life, romance with a side dish of comedy animes!!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I laughed, a lot. I found this anime to be something special, a little different from what I've seen before and hopefully I can find something similar. Here is why.\r\nStory 8/10:  The story is about Usa Kazunari, a highschool boy starting to live on his own because of his parents transfering jobs. He moves in to the Kawai Complex, where he finds very strange induviduals. The story revolves around how Usa and the others act together. The story main goal in my opinion is to make the viewers laugh, even so the story has some romance. Thankfully the romance is very simple and easyto go around if you're not a real romance fan.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: I liked the art very much, not enough for a perfect 10 but very close. It's very colorful and playful. I first found the art to be quite strange but after a few episodes I found myself to like it a lot. The main pro is how colorful it is. The only con to the art in my opinion are the eyes, they're slightly to colorful and pops out a littlebit much. But as a whole it's very good.\\n\\n\r\nSounds 9/10: I enjoyed the sound. It is very simple and fits the anime well. The sounds of the anime doesn't make it a 9 but I enjoyed both the Opening and Ending to give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: I loved some of the characters, hated a few. The development might not be at it's best but I found the two main characters very good and that's what brought up this score. But to be fair, as this is mainly focused of comedy, the characters beside the two main ones are mostly comic reliefs. The main characters counts the most in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: A PERFECT 10. I enjoyed this very very much. I laughed so many times. It was very easy to watch and easy to understand. It's everything you would want out of a slice of life comedy. Simple and not any scenes to fill out the time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: Overall I would say that it's a 9. Mostly because story is not perfect. Even so this is a anime to watch, no matter who you are or what you like you should try it. Happytime all the 12 episodes, mostly comedy with a hint of romance. GO WATCH IT!",

The animation and music is good tho and I also liked the comedy part but the romance is a little bit lacking. Nothing is really unique in this anime but overall I do enjoyed it.\r\nAlso it didn't have a conclusive ending since it didn't cover the whole manga, but honestly I'm not interested enoughto continue reading the manga.",

            "content": "Bokura wa minna kawaiso is a pun -- it means \"we're all from Kawai Boarding House\", but it also means \"we are all pathetic\".  Unfortunately, I felt that was absolutely true about most of the characters in this anime.\r\nI didn't find much to like here.  Slice of life doesn't usually have much of a plot, which isn't a problem for me per se, if instead it gives subtle insights into the lives of the particular people whose \"slice\" we get to see, or into life in general.  We didn't get any of that here.\r\nStory: The miniscule plot of Kazunari Usa trying toget senpai Kawai Ritsu to notice him turned out to be mostly painful and after a while boring.  Much time is spent on the antics of the various \"weirdos\" of the Kawai Boarding House, but they're not interesting weirdos, they're one trick ponies who're overacted to extremes.  Supposedly this is a romance, but actually it's a one-sided crush (which I have no doubt is parlayed into a romance in the manga, just because Usa is persistent, and the Japanese seem to think stalkery behaviour like his proves \"love\").  But in the anime?  No romance. Unless you consider it romantic to exchange phone numbers and email addresses.  The comedy is execrable; crude seinen humour; nothing original here at all.  I don't think I laughed even once.  I smiled a few times, mostly at Ritsu and Usa; the rest was all nearly unbearable noise.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The best thing about the show.  Pretty, detailed art with nice colours, and the animation isn't bad either.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Inoffensive.  Peppy OP and ED.  Nothing special.  Voice talent is always hard to notice when most of them overact for humourous effect.  I had no favourites here, Hanazawa Kana is kind of bland because Ritsu is so reserved; she only really shines a couple of times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  Kazunari Usa is bland, nice to a fault, and basically a clueless git; your typical insert character.  He crushes hard on Kawai Ritsu from the very first moment he sees her at the school library.  Ritsu is an introverted bookworm, but Usa is so clueless that it takes him 5 episodes to come up with the bright idea of asking her something about books, and even then he doesn't do it very intelligently.  \\n\\n\r\nThen we have the \"weirdos\":  Shirosaki, a peeping tom and masochist who cherishes being beaten up which is fortunate since the two young women are violent; Nishikino \"here come my boobs\" Mayumi who has men on the brain and completely fails to sort the losers from the good guys; and college girl Watanabe Ayaka, who is a complete bitch to everyone.  Add Kawai Sumiko, the elderly manager who dispenses the occasional bit of trite wisdom with her pudding.\\n\\n\r\nI liked only Ritsu.  Hey, I am an introverted bookworm, what's not to like -- I'd be friends with her in no time. Here's a hint to the lovelorn:  take an interest in what your crush is interested in, get to actually know them instead of idolizing your image of them.  You don't have to do the same things as they, but show that you care.  Usa is too dim for that, though by the end of it he starts to catch on, and at least he seems genuine about it instead of just using it as a tool.  I don't dislike him so much as I feel he is a blank piece of paper with not much personality of his own.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  poor.  Were it not for the art and sound, this anime would be below average for me.",

            "content": "So I finally watched it after seeing multiple recommendations for it almost every I turn and honestly.. It was ok? It wasn't the best for a 'romance' genre and definitely wasn't what I had hope for.. SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nStory 6/10: So the story isn't terrible, it's actually quite enjoyable.. but then we get to the some parts where it becomes a total snooze fest and I don't understand why it was added in.. The anime could of easily became a 24 episode series where it showed the development between the two main characters but at last it did not and I'm not expecting a season 2considering the time gap between the first and second! The story good though and really fit in well with it showing Ritsu coming out of her shell from this lonely book worm to a.. lonely book worm who can actually socialize abit more now... Overall the story is a sweet and innocent series and will do wonders if you're looking for that type of series. The romance in it isn't strong and it will go no where considering it ended at this point.. It's really slow paced and is kind of stupid.. It took the MC 12 god damn episodes just to get her phone number!! 12 EPISODES!!! Talk about slow.. Personally I don't mind if it's slow IF there is a ending where they get together. The ending was sweet and it showed how they developed over the course of the series but I just didn't enjoy the ending as much as it could of gone.. You could say it completely ruined it for me to see this end the way it did..\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: The art/animation is actually pretty decent in this considering it was released just under 4 years ago.. It's got lots of colors and liked to pop out at you and you'll definitely know what's happening just from the animation.. Sad moments are amazing because you can actually feel the power behind it and really get into it! The animation was dope!\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: I'm not big for sound but nothing really seemed out of place and it did have some good soundtracks here and there..\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10: Personally hated how slow the pace and considering there were no end results for the two main characters but that's nothing that can be helped... The characters were decent and I enjoyed watching a different type of anime where it shows them coming out of their shells, I kind of got a Sakurasou no pet na kanojo vibe for this anime and I'm sure anyone who watched it will too.. Each character developed surprisingly well and it was good to see them develop as a whole! It would of been nice to see more backstory to each character and become more involved with them showing their childhood/past and how it actually came to how they are now.. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: It isn't the bed anime for a romance kind of person or is looking for a sappy love story where they end up together.. But if you're looking for a slow paced romance story which will go no where because the anime ended so quickly then here you go.. I still enjoyed it to a certain point and would recommend it if you've come off of a action packed anime with a lot of death and are looking for something sweet and innocent looking but that's pretty much it's only use for you..",

            "content": "If you live in an apartment complex, you may be forced to interact with the other people who live there. That is okay; you may end up becoming friends with them. In fact, if you get lucky, the one you love may be living in that apartment complex.... or depending on the situation, you may be unlucky. Anyway, this anime was one of the anime I planned to watch back in Spring 2014 but unfortunately missed out on until now. Now, after watching all 12 episodes, I regret not watching it before; it's just that good.\r\nLadies and gentlemen, this is my review of Bokura waMinna Kawaisou, known in English as The Kawai Complex Guide to Manors and Hostel Behavior.\\n\\n\r\nBokura wa Minna Kawaisou is set in a boarding house called the Kawai Complex, run by an elderly woman named Sumiko. The protagonist of this anime, Kazunari Usa, moves to the Kawai Complex due to his parents travelling overseas for work. In the library of his school, he falls in love with a girl who's reading a book, and it turns out that this girl, Ritsu Kawai, also lives at the Kawai Complex. He also meets the other residents of the Kawai Complex, such as Shiro (a masochist who is actually his roommate), Mayumi (a woman who has zero luck with men), and Sayaka (a college student who loves toying with men). Life goes on in the Kawai Complex, as Usa interacts with these people as well as trying to get closer to Ritsu.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I should say about this anime is that it has BEAUTIFUL animation. Brains Base did a solid job with the animation, and the character designs are also solid. The opening (\"Itsuka no, Ikutsuka no Kimi to no Sekai\" by fh\u00e1na) and ending themes (\"My Sweet Shelter\" by Kana Hanazawa, Rina Satou, and Hisako Kanemoto) are quite catchy, and I like listening to them. Neither of them are the best songs I've ever listened to, but they fit the tone of this anime very well. The voice acting is also very good, especially Kana Hanazawa as Ritsu; she really nailed her role!\\n\\n\r\nThe story in this anime.... admit it, you guys; it's been used before. I'm not saying that it's a bad story; it's just cliche, with an unsatisfying conclusion that could make anyone who really liked this anime think, \"OH MY GOD, WHERE'S SEASON TWO OF THIS?!\" Believe me, those are my thoughts right now.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this anime has a variety of characters who are quite likable. I think the character I liked the most was Ritsu. It's not because she is the love interest here; it's because I completely relate to her. I'd personally rather read books than interact with other people. I also really liked Usa; it's obvious that he really cares about Ritsu, and I rooted for him the whole way through. The supporting cast is also a very interesting one, especially Shiro. His masochistic behavior made for a lot of funny moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou. If you're in the mood for a nice, relaxing rom-com, this one is right up your alley. It would be quite fun to see what goes on in the Kawai Complex!",

            "content": "Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is a feel good, light romance story, and while it remains easy to enjoy, it is ultimately let down by poor pacing in character development. The male lead is a stereotypical shy guy starting his first year of high school, who wishes for peace and quiet in his life, and an intelligent demure girl to spend his time with. He quickly discovers the target of his desires, a quiet bookish girl who attends his school and lives in the same apartment building. Let the wooing begin. \r\nBut, all sorts of barriers lay between our hero and heroine, which make up thebulk of the story. They both have to get over their awkward natures and shyness, as well as their tenancies to assume the feelings and intentions of others. They are also beset by a horde of meddling supporting characters, who mainly just get in the way and provide comedic relief. \\n\\n\r\nSlowly, the two get closer to each other, and when I say slowly, I mean really slowly. The core of these sorts of shows though is sexual tension. Will they understand each other? Will this person's actions be misinterpreted? It's hyperbole, but at some point I kind of felt like it was Inuyasha, 150 episodes in and he still hadn't sealed the deal with Kagome. So, maybe people like to watch the struggle? Maybe a bit of projection going on? Anyway, this tension is the one thing the show has going for it. It's also it's greatest weakness because the characters can't really evolve out of their initial states without destroying or at least lessening that tension, so slow to no character development.\\n\\n\r\nNothing special on the art or music front. If you're prepared for a cute, awkward ride, give Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou a try.",

            "content": "_Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou_ was, in all, enjoyable. It was not particularly exceptional, nor was it original, but for a casual series to relax to, it was certainly a nice bit of entertainment. The comedic aspects were well done, if a little overblown, while the main character's romantic plot and character development made for a decently well-developed and perhaps above-average \"serious\" side to the series.\r\nThe story is fairly typical: you have a high schooler, a boarding house setting, a potential love interest, a cast of seemingly stereotypical characters that tend to antagonise the main character but aren't specifically malicious (or... are they?). The main charactertries to get closer to the love interest, only to dig himself and get himself into various kinds of trouble with the boarding house residents.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the story did quite well goes hand-in-hand with the characterisation: the story between the main character, KAZUNARI Usa, and KAWAI Ritsu. Ritsu is a bookworm and a bit of a loner, preferring to keep to herself than interact with the rest of the boarding house members. For this kind of anime, you'd expect Usa to figure out the big secret to her heart or something deep in her past, get through to her, they share a kiss or overt intimate moment of some other sort, curtains, applause, show's done. But the writers obviously put some greater thought in developing this story: their relationship evolves with time and familiarity and not without effort, and their individual characters evolve quite naturally along with that, which left me mostly quite satisfied with the overall course of that story. It is wrapped up in a sense, it's not a 'happily ever after': it is, indeed, left quite open-ended.\\n\\n\r\nI did say I was satisfied with the _overall_ course of the story. Many of Usa's and Ritsu's actions, and their characterisation in its finer details, left something to be desired. They often acted in ways that went beyond my suspension of disbelief for their characterisation, seeming far too exaggerated for the sake of comedy (or worse, when intended as an earnest reaction). A potent example of this is how Usa thought about Ritsu and around her, which felt disproportionate even for a high school boy of his character. This is perhaps reflected on all the other characters: in fact, while a certain depth of character and backstory was revealed for some characters (Chinatsu, Hayashi and Shiro come to mind), they mostly stuck to their stereotypes and did not develop over the course of the series; development seemed to have been limited to Usa and Ritsu primarily.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art, it took a middle-path kind of approach: the art style was fairly typical of moe, exaggerating neither cutesy features or more stylised anime styles, nor going into the realm of realistic and harder features. To highlight comedy and reactions, of course, it frequently resorted to other styles that meshed quite well. Animation was generally smooth and transparent. However, my one gripe with the art is the colouring and shading: with the saturated colours and particular style of shading, I felt like everything was too \"shiny\" in appearance, especially in contrast to the last series I watched, _Isshuukan Friends_.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was neither exceptional nor poor. It simply fit well into the genre, with music ranging from thoughtful or romantic solo piano works to more peppy, \"daily life\"/\"RPG shop\" style music.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I wouldn't go out of my way to praise this series, but for something light and amusing, with a sweet early romantic plot that's perhaps a cut above the norm, I wouldn't recommend against it. Just don't expect any literary award-winning material here.",

It may not make my favorites but I did like it very much.\r\nLet's start with the story. As this is a slice of life the story could be summed up as the daily lives of those who live in Kawai Complex. The stories usually only encompass one episode but are highly entertaining and funny.\r\nAs for the art.....Jesus Christ it's beautiful. This anime is a feast for the eyes. Some of the outfits that the characters wear are just gorgeous. At certain moments, whatit does with lighting and coloring is just so pretty! It also has its characters go into chibi forms to better help with comedic moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound is....kinda good but not really impressive. For this aspect I primarily look at the openings and endings but it wasn't anything mind blowing. The song for the opening I kinda liked but how the visuals were set up didn't really impress me. The ending encapsulates the lives of the characters pretty well so that gives it more points in my book. All in all I preferred the ending theme to the opening one. As for background music, nothing really caught my attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show were quirky and very funny. Many jokes were repeated but don't  I feel annoyed about it. I found the characters quite likeable and though they didn't contain the depths of the ocean within them, they had enough personality not to be boring after awhile. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, I enjoyed this series a lot and would watch it again.",

Usa-Kun, please just move on before my heart breaks! Usa-kun and Kawai-senpai are the main characters of this gorgeously done anime. Truly, the animation is stunning and the backgrounds don\u2019t seem to be recycled; it truly seems like thestudio put a lot of love into this anime. The characters are very good-looking and those that aren\u2019t intended to be, have a quirky and colorful personality to make up for it. And for me, that was what made this anime so great! The unique and peculiar personalities of the characters, their flaws and how their humor made the relentlessness of our main character bearable. If you are anything like me, and hate waiting for the \u201cBig Ones\u201d aka Naruto, One Piece & Dragon Ball Super, to get their ISH together and just come on already, then this anime is for you!

Bynow you probably thought this: \"Hmph, another typical romance anime, MC wants a girlfriend...blah blah blah...\" Boy, I can't tell you how wrong you were if you thought that! Though you'd be right in saying that SOME romance anime does tend to hover around the fact that the MC wants a girlfriend, I can't blame you for thinking that but what you must keep in mind is that Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou continuously provides you with what most romance animes couldn't: The sense of involvement.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the very first episode, you feel as though you'd do anything to live in the Kawai Complex with these strange, yet unique, characters. Usa already made his goal very clear in the first episode, and it is nearly impossible to not fall in love with this girl that Usa likes so much.\\n\\n\r\nRitsu, the girl of Usa's dreams, is by far the best female MC I have gotten the privilege to see in anime. Her behavior when she's around the little Kawai Complex group makes you wonder whether this anime can get any better than it already is. Also her hobby to read contrasts so well with Usa's general behavior in the anime, he's quite a noticeable guy whereas Ritsu is invisible, making this anime such a great watch. As for the other characters', they really do make the anime more enjoyable in the sense that they add sweetness to this very lighthearted anime. Their comedic moments are just hilarious and really brightens up your day!\\n\\n\r\nI adore how this anime absolutely nails to combine its romantic moments and comedic moments together! Unlike most romance anime, Bokira wa Minna Kawaisou takes a different twist on the genre. It's an anime which you can count on to NOT provide you with tons of mishaps or misunderstandings.\\n\\n\r\nWe can all learn from Usa's determination to get Ritsu, his adored Senpai, to notice him. If there's someone that we truly care about then there are nothing stopping you from confessing/showing your gratitude and love towards them. \\n\\n\r\nReasons why I like the anime:\\n\r\n-It is the VERY FIRST anime I have seen, and I've seen many anime's, where the characters' doesn't have bizarre hair colors!\\n\r\n-The chemistry between each character is so strong that you'd be mad to not want to live with them in the Kawai Complex.\\n\r\n-Ritsu is so adorable!! I became envious of Usa! :(\\n\r\n-I was moved by Usa's love towards his Senpai, Ritsu.\\n\r\n-Shiro, Usa's masochistic roommate, made me laugh every episode.\\n\r\n-The landlady of the Kawai Complex made me realize how kind and accepting some people are if you open up to them.\\n\r\n-I felt as though I was a part of the Kawai Complex group, I considered them as family.\\n\\n\\n\r\nReasons why I did NOT like the anime:\\n\r\n-I wouldn't consider this as a spoiler but we were, in a way, left on a cliffhanger on the last episode. I would be over the moon if a second season came out but I wouldn't know!\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for things like sound, character, art and story, I'd say that each and every aspect was done to an exceptional effort. The story keeps you engaged and makes you curious to what the next episode has ready for you. The sound is amazing, really puts your mind at ease. The characters' are so caring towards each other (that's a lie, Usa doesn't like most of them but in a friendly way, making Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou the definition of a 'perfect romance anime'\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say that this anime really set the bar up VERY high. \\n\\n\r\nI'd give it an 20/10. A must watch! Thanks for reading! =)",

The story is about your average highschool boy, his junior high school life was a disaster because he always encounters weird people so he tries to spend his high school life in peace and wanted to have a intellectual and refined girlfriend. Until he find himself moving to Kawai Complex that's full of weird people w/ccompletely ruined everthing.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe art is very colorful and really cute,but sometimes the screen is just a character and some random color in the background and I'm not really a fan of art so I have nothing else to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nThe OP is really good, very worth watching every episode. And the ED is really cute, I have no idea what the lyrics is but I really love it and I can see myself listening to it everytime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\r\nThe characters is very well made and very unforgettable. We have Usa w/c I always red as USA also known as Oddball Handler cause for some unexplained reason he always got stuck w/ weird people. Ricchan who is Usa's love interest that loves books, she seriously love reading books that she didn't care if someone's going to rape her. Sumiko the manager of Kawai Complex who is old enough to shrink. Mayumi who has a big boobs and bad luck w/ men. Shiro, Usa's masochist roomate that gets turned on in almost everthing. And Sayaka... who is really cute and loves to tease Usa and Ricchan a lot. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9.5\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this show, there's just the time when it's so slow and that is when Ricchan is on screen talking and kinda annoys me. I also didn't like when USA and Ricchan is alone talking about books, I just can't relate. If someone finished watching this and says he/she didnt enjoy it, they was probably lying. Because I can't imagine someone watching this and don't laugh out loud.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.8\\n\r\nI gived Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou a 7.8 and I give thanks for it is only a 12 episode show, I will be bored otherwise. Oh, I'm still curious what happened w/ Hayashi and that spirit guy.\\n\\n\r\nThe End and Thank you for reading.",

            "content": "Before I write this review I would like to state that this is my opinion you may disagree or agree at your own will.\r\nReview:\r\nI used to only watch action, adventure, and just more darker anime usually but when a friend suggested that I watch Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou I was really confused because she knew I didn't watch this kinda of anime. This anime opened me too a whole new genre of anime that I could enjoy and it even opened me to try to watch other genres. Bokure wa Minna Kawaisou is one of my favorite anime and it's a romance anime at that.This anime is a perfect blend of many things. The intro isn't the best but still suits the anime fine. Character wise they let you grow attached to the MC by making you feel for him and actually kinda care about what he does. The love interest in the anime is one of those strong, book reading, silent type of girls who you will adore. The side characters are hilarious and you actually care to get to know them and want to see them on screen. The only problem with this anime is some of it's conflict. Without conflict nothing can progress throughout anything. Conflict arises and that's what starts every anime, book, movie you name it. The conflict itself isn't the problem it's how the characters handle it. It's one of those many things I hate in anime where the characters have a problem but decided to do the most difficult way possible to solve the problem. Where something that could be cleared up in 2 episodes takes 4 which I'm not a big fan of because if you're only gonna be a 12 episode season make the most of it. All in all Bokure wa Minna Kawaisou is one of my top anime I have ever watched.",

            "content": "This is my first review, but this anime absolutely clicked with me so I really want to write about it. Also, it should be noted that there are only 10 episodes out of (I think) 13 out so far, so the \"climax\" and most dramatic parts are still to be shown.\r\nAnyway, it is safe for me to say that this is my favorite anime this season and depending on the ending may be up there as one of my favorite anime in general as well. This is because of multiple elements that make up the refreshing and, in my opinion, unique experience of watching thisseries. \\n\\n\r\nStory [8/10]:\\n\r\nThe best thing that I like about the story is that there is no horsing around with who the male protagonist, Usa, likes. It is clear from episode one that he is heads-over-heels for shy, bookworm, and possibly loner, Ritsu. This makes it easier for the audience to form an emotional connection with their growing relationship as there is no wondering \"Oh, is he gonna start liking this girl? Oh, what about this transfer student, is he gonna like her now? Who will he end up with?\". The audience pretty much knows that they will end up together but since Ritsu is pretty anti-social it's all about how Usa goes about getting closer to her. Having all the characters live in the same complex makes for some hilarious and smart situations. Overall, for 13 episodes only, the series is refreshingly slow-paced and lighthearted and very relatable.\\n\\n\r\nArt [9/10]:\\n\r\nAs an artist myself, I very much enjoy the art of this anime. Though nothing \"revolutionary\", the use of colors and lighting is absolutely gorgeous and fits the mood of the anime so well. If you pay attention you'll notice that much of the anime takes place when the sun is setting or rising and this gives plenty of opportunity for the anime to show off it's beautiful spectrum of colors. It's safe to say that there are many scenes where you can see the whole spectrum of the rainbow and values from very dark to very bright. The show would just not be the same without the art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound [8/10]:\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs could be better, but I have gotten attached to them as I have watched the current episodes multiple times each and never skip them. Although, where the sound truly shines are the moments between Usa and Ritsu. I still remember the piano medley playing when Usa and Ritsu first meet eachother and how it suited the atmosphere so well. Overall, the music score never gets boring and knows just how to set the mood of any scene especially romantic ones.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10]:\\n\r\nThe characters have to be the best part about this anime. There are six main characters who live in the same complex and all of them are of different ages. It is only Ritsu and Usa who are close to the same age and that also reinforces their \"fated\" love because the older tenants are constantly either helping make or break their relationship. The interactions between characters in this anime are some of the most down-to-earth and realistic I've seen in a series so far. There is nothing outlandish like constant pantyshots or somehow tripping and grabbing a breast or even a bathtub scene (so far, atleast). Each of the situations and conversations the characters have gotten into are something that could easily take place in real life and that makes it all the more relatable to the viewer. I especially hate the \"frenemy\" dynamics of Mayumi and Sayaka. As girls who are insecure in their own ways they are really catty to eachother and I know many girls in real life who are like that. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10/10]:\\n\r\nI took a break from anime and even when I got back into it last month I haven't encountered one that made me want to rewatch it as soon as I finished it, or caught up to the most recent episode. This is the one that did it for me. I have seen the current episodes at least three times each and it maybe takes me 40 minutes to watch a single one because I'm constantly replaying parts. I don't know what the \"secret ingredient\" is or why I enjoy Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou so much but there is just something special about it. If you read this far you would have seen the word \"relatable\" many times by now and that's because this anime is just that, at least to me. I'm a hopeless romantic who's first love and romance was very much less sweet and innocent as Ritsu and Usa's so I guess the combined \"romanticized love\" and relatability of the situations and conversations of the series makes it a winner to me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [10/10]:\\n\r\nI feel like I really buttered this anime up and at the same time might lack experience to say it's the bomb.com but I feel how I feel about it right now and that's what's important. Toradora! is my favorite anime of all time and what I consider a masterpiece of rom-com. Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou is no Toradora!, I have not shed a tear yet, or gotten angry or too anxious. But it is that in itself that makes this anime special. It's a true \"slice-of-life\". No cliche's, no situations that would never happen, but all nostalgia of a time when relationships were so innocent and friendships didn't hurt.\\n\\n\r\nGreat anime.\\n",

But I am quite a school-romance freak so basically i loved it . Actually even though the story may seem same at first , it will likely spread its wings soon and change into something magnificent and something totally different. I really have hopes for this anime.it is seeming very similar to Sakurasou no pet na kanojo, which is a very high rated anime.But the sad part is .. it will only get 12-13 episodes, whicjh i think is tooless for it.\\n\\n\r\nArt : Pretty adult . I really dont have much to say .. though i found it has a very slight shoujo touch to it .\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : That's where it all went down. I found the main character very weak and normal. the side characters however are doing quite nicely.We have had \"My teenage romance is wrong as expected SNAFU\" in which the story didn't do good but the main character was too good . This is basically the opposite .But thats till the first episode . As the story progresses one will feel the character is progressing , the supporting character are doing well too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : I am practically enjoying every last bit of it .The comedy is awesome and it will make you ROFL. Seriously this is a must , if you are wanting to see something happy , i wanted to something like this because i was seeing really dark animes recently , so it just freshened the mood.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion : If you are feeling sad or depressed , just give this a try i ensure you 101% mood upliftment. I am pretty strict while giving scores so .. i give it a 8.5 or a 8.. never a 9. But it surely deserves a watch.",

Main character is a nice guy that gets thrown into a new life style where he meets the stories side characters. Side characters all follow some sort of character trope and have no real character development. The story really only follows the group at the apartment complex and does not really delve deeper into his school life.\r\nThe art really had me to watch the whole show. I really liked the art, very bright colors and well drawn characters. I especially liked the heroine and how theycolored eyes, very sparkly. I do not really know how to express how the art is just watch one episode and you will see. \\n\r\n Main character is a nice guy to a fault, just the usual main character seen in any other romance anime. The heroine is the shy, lonely, library girl trope which usually does not get the heroine spot so it was interesting to see how they progressed the plot with her and the main character. At some times it is very hard to see the two together and I personally thought that the MC acted creepy sometimes towards the heroine but not so much so that it turned me off to the show. Just some teenage inexperience and awkwardness. Overall a good representation of teenagers.",

Though it should be said the romance established within the story is still endearing and entertaining to watch unfold slowly over the course of its 12 episodes. My main issue arises from the wasted  potential on some of the characters, as unfortunately most of the supporting cast are completely two dimensional even after events that would influence their outlook or personality, making them feel unmemorable. This is similar to the setting itself,as by the around the 4th episode it begins to fade into the background entirely and ends up being another generic location.\\n",

            "content": "An anime adaptation of a not-so-big big but popular enough series of the same name. You might be thinking \"A friend of mine told me this was great but then I read a plot synopsis and saw the first bit of the first episode and sort of don't get it.\" Well this is exactly what nobody has said because most people lose interest after reading the \"unoriginal\" plot synopsis and don't actually give it a go.\r\nSo what is \"Bokura wa minna Kawaisou\"? Well it's about a young Usa who wants to live a simple life, but the people around him just don't let that happen,from his fellow Kawai Sou residents to his own parents, everyone loves to be...... \"unique\". Now, some people say this anime is bland, however from where I sit, I can't understand where that statement comes in. The colour palette makes every bit of scenery look like art and the animation is very well done. Despite very little action if not almost no action at all happening throughout the series, the animators always find a way to make as many things happen on screen as possible. if it's not in the foreground, it'll be in the background, if it's not in the background, it'll be in the corner. It feeds the viewer a consistent stream of joy if you enjoy it's humour.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of it's humour! It's a little unique in which the characters are somewhat aware of their own media. However this is not the same as Seitokai no Ichizon or Joshiraku where the characters directly state that they're in an anime, but more so the characters for example may for some reason be able to hear the other character's thoughts or may directly reference the onomatopoeic words used often in japanese manga which appear on screen. However you never once lose the immersion as this feels almost like the best way to tell the story in this show. I wish I could describe it better, but the humour in this show somehow has both variety and consistency, which makes it unique in it's own way.\\n\\n\r\nSo what do I like most about this show? Well because I can rewatch it several times and still get a good laugh out of it, the voice actors and animators seem to have put in 100% effort on all fronts, the comedy is well timed, there's just enough fan service for it not to be in the way but still enjoyable and the characters, while sound like stereotypes, have several layers to their personalities which can be explored by each and every character interaction. But most of all, the adults look, feel and behave like adults, while the kids all look, feel and behave like kids, which is something anime often gets wrong.\\n\\n\r\nSo what do I recommend for this show? Watch it, and if you don't like it, then fair enough, but I think you'll like it.\\n\r\nIt really is an underrated show.",

            "content": "These days we'll find plenty of comedic, slice of life shows following a boy during his journey known as high school. However, often we find that the reality of the \"high school\" is in fact an elementary school filled with overly-moe girls and other chuunibyou-obsessed archetypes. Well, this show bucks that trend by presenting a cast that actually acts relatively of age, and for once truly presents some seinin-level comedy without having to resort to super powers or cat ears. The best description I can think of is a Sakurasou setting (and arguably heroine) with the behavioral maturity of Golden Time. The show isn't goingto win any awards for its plot progression but the interactions are great, and proves that there is still life after moe. All studios should take note, this is a slice of life done right.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe show is surprisingly well drawn for the genre. Expect nicely-saturated coloring, crisp lines, excellent shading and detail. The show strikes a nice balance between serious and comedic moments, it does come across as bit more of the latter with hiragana popups and colorful, flat backgrounds to emphasize moments. The character design is very good with distinct characters and good facial animations. I'm usually not a fan of the kuudere, bookworm type but, unlike certain other shows, there was enough dere in Ritsu's behaviors and facial expressions to win me over.\\n\\n\r\nThis show doesn't focus on action so aside from some comedic references I wouldn't expect much. The show has a bit of light ecchi, much of it is implied through speech sort of like Seitokai Yakuindomo, aside from Shirosaki's masochism. Expect some suggesting scenes and a lot of jokes based on relationships, body part sizes, experience levels, etc.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show opens with a light and refreshing-sounding OP and closes with a more playful tune sung by the heroines. The show has a relatively active BGM and sound effects track. Much of the BGM is calming though so it may be a bit sleep inducing if watched too late.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the show's plot and comedy are dialogue-driven so expect the VA's to play a big role in the show. They deliver brilliantly with talents including Kana Hanazawa, Rina Satou, and Hisako Kanemoto. Kanahana masterfully navigates Ritsu's kuudere personality while Rina Satou keeps things lively with the loud and bolsterous Mayumi. I haven't heard much of late from Hisako Kanemoto but she delivers marvelously here.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nUsa-kun has had to manage interesting personalities around him all his life, and now all he wants is a peaceful and normal high school life. Thus, he manages to convince his parents to send him to a boarding house where he can finally live on his own. To his immediate dismay, he finds that he actually has a roommate across a partition, and even worse he seems to be a masochistic bum. Moments later, while running out, he discovers that his sempai and crush, Ritsu, also lives at the Kawai Complex. The show follows Usa's daily routine as he interacts with the distinct residents at the complex and attempts fruitlessly to win Ritsu's heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is full of up and down moments like the ones in the past paragraph. It soon becomes clear that Usa's daily life is anything but routine as he ends up working a part-time job and dealing with various shenanigans from his housemates. The show is mostly episodic with a slight build up of tension towards the end, though there's not much of a conclusion. The comedy feels refreshing with a good variety of jokes ranging from cultural norms to those of a more sexual nature. What I particularly enjoyed was how a lot of these jokes tied into Usa's relationship with Ritsu and how he always ended up at the wrong place at the wrong time to only win her ire.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a light show with a good dose of comedy, and don't need a very focused plot, this is a good watch. However, be aware that the romance is only fleeting, there's just enough progress to keep your hope alive but nothing comes of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nDespite the great animation, I think this is where this show shines the most. The characters in this show feel like they have an air of maturity that is sorely lacking elsewhere in the anime realm. Yes, they do behave immature from time to time, especially when under a few drinks, but overall the tonality and subjects are a few years beyond your typical moe show. All the characters have decent backgrounds and very strong characterization. Though Sayaka's makeup witchcraft is a bit scary, most of the characters are also pretty relatable, especially Usa with his development with Ritsu. Despite being a bit on the slow side, the development does make some progress, and the show does a great job of milking it for maximum value.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nOverall, this was a very enjoyable show. It isn't the type of show that you absolutely must watch in one sitting but the interactions alone are entertaining enough to keep you going. If you're looking for some good'ol slice of life before the days of K-on but with up to date animation styling, definitely give this a try.",

Very easy to follow and very enjoyable. Very slice of like and the romance is a bit weak but a lot of potential if a second season ever airs. Comedy is a very strong pointy. Drama isn't overdone and the ease of watching this 10/10 not too straining not to boring.\r\nArt: 9\r\nThis kind of art is my style so it's definitely bias opinion. I really like the way eyes are so well drawn, all the characters look gorgeous howeverthe scenery could use a little more work. What I mean by scenery is that there isn't much variety another words same scenes are used over and over again (weakest part of the art) however the lighting is superb and stunning (really is) and the comedy art is great, but could be better.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThis is the weakest element to the anime IMO as far as sound effects go it's spot on. However music isn't the greatest although I do enjoy the opening quite a bit.The ending song isn't that great. You can't expect too much music going when so much comedy is going happening but there really seems to be a large amount of music lacking.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nStrongest point of this whole anime is the characters all are very well developed (however much you can do that in 1 season) although these personality characters are arguably cliche and overused they aren't over done (overdoing their roles) side characters bring depth to the anime and don't overly draw the attention, they don't overdo their roles and are all very lovable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis anime is highly enjoyable and the re-watch value of this one is very high, its very laid back with exception of a few drama tense moments, but every slice of life needs a few of those moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nGets raised to a 9 mostly due to the lovable characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nWatch it. Easy to follow. Awesome art and Character's. Weak point is primarily sound and story isn't out of this world.",

The show always kept me laughing throughout, that by the end of it I was wanting a second series. \r\nThe characters and plot are typically what you'd find in a romantic comedy (the main character, his love interest, the big-breasted friend and the perverted side-kick), and it revolves around a guy named Kazunari Usa who falls in love with a quiet, introverted second-year girl named Kawai Ritsu. He moves into a boarding house only to find out that Kawai Ritsu alsolives there, along with 3 others, Mayumi Nishikino, the big-breasted, seductive character who spends 90% of the series drunk or depressed due to everyone around her finding love except her, Sayaka Watanabe, a cute, \"innocent\" girl who is actually incredibly manipulative of guys and has some sort of perverted relationship with Mayumi. Then we also have Shirosaki, a perverted man in his late twenties or early thirties who seems to love anything to do with S&M. \\n\\n\r\nThis combination of characters bring a whole lot of laughter to the series which I enjoyed greatly. The style of anime is great, lively and very well drawn, along with the setting. For anyone looking for an anime to simply pass the time, or enjoy a good laugh, then you will enjoy this series. Personally, I hope a second series will be released, but I may be hoping for a little too much. Either way, this is a must-see for any romantic comedy fans!",

We see some sparks of romance, and although the development of it is really slow, it's not frustrating to watch. Rather, it is the innocence of Ritsu and Usa as well as their character development that makes it so entertaining. There are also many running gags created by the nature of the characters and before the end of the show, I find myself anticipating the next time it would occur.\r\nThere weresome plot developments that were predictable, so there aren't many plot twists that can surprise me. But these clich\u00e9 don't make the story any less good. Rather, there are many instances where these shoujo anime clich\u00e9 are what makes it funny and entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are fine.

We've seen lots with the same setting as that, from classics like Maison Ikkoku and Hiatari Ryoko to recent ones like Love Hina, Mahoraba and Sakurasou. Premise doesn't really matter, nothing is original anymore anyways. What's important is how the creators presented it. Will Bokura wa Minna Kawaiso fare differently? Let's check it out.\r\nThis premiered at the TBS block which is famous for having ecchi moe series, but suprisingly it's not that moe. To be honest,  it's quite mature that this kind of series that should be premiering at noitaminA instead. (and they're showing Nanana there, which is sortamoe so...)\\n\r\nI'm confused  Let's continue with the review.\\n\\n\r\nThe series starts with a high school boy Kazunari Usa, who wanted to live on his own. His parents saw the perfect place for their son for cheapskates like them. Behold the Kawai Complex! Suprisingly, the senpai he admires at the library lives at the same complex! And his new found place is notorious for having weird inmate-I mean boarders.\\n\\n\r\n-Oh no... They just crossed all the list in my \"Things must have in an apartment anime\". But like I said, presentation.\\n\\n\r\nA notable thing for this series is it's art. Mind you, ART and not ANIMATION. The color scheme suits for depending on the scenes. The massive use of blur and lens flare worked like a charm. Another thing to praise is their shadings. It really looked like a classic anime (back when they put to much detail in one frame). Animation ranges from normal to lazy. \\n\r\nThank god the beautiful style makes up for it even if in some scenes it's only talking heads.\\n\\n\r\nSound was good all through out. From the very memorable opening to the not so memorable but fun ending song. Each sound was used wisely depending in the mood/situation. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are yeah, same cutout characters. We have a sexy office lady that walks in her undies, a weirdo and the list goes on. But what made them special is how they react depending on what situation they're in. They feel human. The humor is either a hit or miss. But it's seldom miss for me xD\\n\\n\r\nAm I being biased or is the author despises men that much? The boys here are portrayed either they're useless or just evil. It's always the girls that solves the problems. I mean, I'm okay with that. But come on, make them do something! Heck, all I know about the other guy in the complex is he's a masochist. That's it. He's even part of the main cast! Sure it's still ongoing but... never mind.\\n\\n\r\nI won't call this the special one of it's genre but it's a good contender. If you want to relax and brighten up your mood. I definitely recommend checking this one out.",

Oddly enough, for an anime without supernatural elements, extreme situations, or a cornucopia of fan-service; it's relatively entertaining. This is primarily due to the strength of the character \"revelation\", which is splendid. Unfortunately the storyline is a little mundane (the typical high-school love trope), but some of that is to be expected given the medium.  However to really appreciate this show, I feel that you need to try and lookpast the obvious interaction between Usa and Ritsu and pay closer attention to the supporting cast. \\n\\n\r\n   The art is decent in this one, maybe not the most beautiful or original artwork I've ever seen, but it's not simply riddled with blank-faced, motionless, characters in the background.  The scenes are generally pretty lively, the ambient lighting is nice, and the cut-away humor is great.\\n\\n\r\n  That said, it would appear that the nature of this anime is to give us a glimpse into the simple life of Usa and his roommates at the Kawai Complex - which I'd say it's accomplished. \\n\\n\r\nSome detailed thoughts:\\n\r\n  While scrutinizing this anime, I thought over many situations involving daily life at the Kawai complex. At first, I suspected that the living situation might be untranslatable (as is often the case in anime) - however it would appear I was wrong in this initial regard. Bills are mentioned, laundry is done, and we even see poor Shirosaki working an odd-job to make ends meet. \\n\\n\r\n  It's also worth noting that the back-stories do a great job of explaining \"why\" a character acts a certain way, but that they don't actually \"develop\" that character (except perhaps in the nominal sense that our view of the character has developed, but that's a whole different level of meta). What I'm getting at is that two of the supporting characters (with strong backstories) remain rather static while one (who receives only minimal backing) actually changes and evolves with Usa and Ritsu, and our point of view is influenced more by their current actions than their history.  In-fact, it's almost more accurate to say that this particular character changes more than Usa and Ritsu do over the course of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT\\n\\n\r\nThe character I'm talking about is Shiro.  His character development is distinctly different from the \"revelations\" we have about the other tenants of the Kawai Complex. In-fact, it's even possible to say that over the course of the anime - he is the only tenant who observes the others around him and adjusts his \"set course\" to compensate for the needs of others.  If you're watching this for the first time, or the second time, pay close attention to his progression through the story and you can note how he evolves from a \"hentai\" detriment on society, to a caregiver and a nurturer through his actions.",

The unexpected things this show has are positively funny and it remembers not to step on unacceptable and taboo matters. It's quite funnythe way this anime treats cliches. It's like they know you're expecting them and they're also trying to say that they're aware that you are also aware. To be honest, this is probably the series where Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo took its inspiration from as it has the same theme and other similar plot details. Fear not because they are not exactly the same, and neither one was better than the other. \\n\\n\r\nI can describe this as an anime with a soft storyline. Truly something you can watch as you relax. The opening and ending themes as well as the soundtrack fit very well.\\n\\n\r\nI was quite surprised with the way this anime turned out to be.

Usa fall in love at first sight for his senpai, when he meets her at the library of their school. Usa lives at the Kawai residence, a complex where several persons live. He meets there the residents of the Kawai complex who have multiple and colorful personnalities. He also learns that Ritsu lives there: this the treshold of their romantic interaction.\r\nThis a short anime (and a short manga too), with asimple story, yet with very interesting and attaching characters. The first one is Kawai Ritsu, who has a suitable name: she will become a new waifu, in the kuudere and tsundere genre, who is very discreet, a book lover, and will have great difficulties to communicate with other people and to accept her feelings towards Usa. The others are the residents of the Kawai complex, a childish pervert, a woman who can't find love, an other who hides behind a make-up mask and the owner of the complex, Ritsu's grandmother. Each one are lovable in their own way but form a real family together, which is quite adorable.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the art style, it's really colorful, maybe too much: the color association is sometimes quite weird. Nonetheless, the lines are faithful to the manga. The opening and ending are quite pleasurable, classic but no more to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of this anime lies in the simple pleasures of life about living with other people and especially in the relation between the two protagonists, Ritsu and Usa, shipping them in each episode and hoping for any sign of them getting closer. :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The cast of characters is diverse and hilarious, where else will you find a masochist, and bookworm, a sadistic cute girl and a super hot desperate girl with huge boobs? I appreciate taking the basic formula of \"put a lot of people in a house together with not much happening and let the story write itself\". This is typical slice of life stuff and I think it is done quite well. Ifthere were any issues it would be that the ending felt a bit generic and the MC was a little too nice (as is often the case in these things) so he came across a bit whiny and desparate. That being said, for a single season anime this is fun and I suggest it!\\n\\n\r\nStory 9 / Art 9 / Sound 7 / Character 9 / Enjoyment 8 / Overall 8",

There are so many anime that rely on eroticism, cookie-cutter characters, relationship problems, etc., but this one didn't follow any of those expected trends. Every episode of this show is light-hearted and leaves you satisfied, making you want to savor it more than simply get to the next plot point. All of the characters have their own unique driving attributes, giving the show more depth and intrigue. With most anime of this length, theending feels like a rush to the end in order to leave the viewers somewhat accepting of the ending. This anime didn't rush or try to resolve everything last minute, but rather continued at its natural rate of growth, and it also somehow doesn't make you feel like you're left hanging. I'm definitely going to be picking up the manga after this little taste because I can't get enough of this. Would definitely recommend this anime, 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have any comments on how I could improve my reviews, feel free to share your thoughts with me.",

The artwork is breathtaking, the characters quirky yet realistic( in a slice of life aspect), and the story straightforward. But what makes this stand out is that it provides a serious love story with humor throughout to appeal to anyone. It has humor to appeal to intelligent people, classic perverted humor, situational humor, and easy one liners. Without dragging the story down with humor this anime effortlessly tells its story. There are no filler episodes, as each episode ties into the mains story. Best ofall you are following the story of two wholesome characters that when they are happy, it brings a smile to your face. But what puts it at a 9 instead of a 10 is that watching it made me need another season because this was too good. My one criticism is that i wasn't blown away by the music, but the artwork more then makes up for that.",

            "content": "***THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW***\r\nWhile a little too slice of life(y) for some, Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou boasts a beautiful color scheme accompanied by a fun cast.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nSo like most slice of life anime, there really isn't an engrossing plot to hold the show together. Basically each following episode picks off from where the previous one ended. The main idea of this story is the following of the activities of an apartment complex's activities and its residents. It doesn't set any new milestones in story telling; just shows the lives of these residents.\r\nAnimation: 8.5/10\r\nThe animation is very appealing to look at due to howthe characters are drawn and the very obvious tone difference between the serious and not so serious scenes. What really makes this anime beautiful though in my opinion is the absolutely beautiful color scheme they chose to go with. Each shot is just beautiful to look at due to the heavy overload of purples and blues. I have to say that I haven't seen an anime colored like this before.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOther than the ridiculously catchy and great ending song sequence, the sound aspects of the anime were just what I expected them to be. I applaud the voice actors for doing a great job selling their characters to the audience.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHere it is, the most important category for any slice of life anime. Slice of life FEEDS on its character interactions; if they end up sucking then there is no hope for the show. Did Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou pull it off? Hell yes.\\n\\n\r\nWhile all the characters seem pretty generic, the way they interacted with each other had me glued to the screen. The chemistry present was in plethora amounts. Every scene with every character was very enjoying to watch no matter how trivial the present matter was. Both the back and forth between the two older female residents and the developing relationship between the two main characters were a blast to see over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.1/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show really hit home with me because it reminded me of an old manga I read a long time ago called Mahoraba. This manga had pretty much the same set up; an apartment complex full of interesting characters living out their lives. This spiritual successor Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou does a great job of giving us (the audience) interesting scenes of life(y) nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you do not like slice of life shows then there is absolutely no way you will like this anime. You have to understand anime like this (Tamako Market, Aria (series), Ouran High School Host Club, ext) only appeal to a watcher if the characters are worth the time invested. I feel like Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou did its job in this aspect thus is worth your attention if you are looking for a new slice of life anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "This anime is something very special. It is not the typically, romantically anime where there is always a rival and where everything will not go as it is planned - also known as a love triangle. \r\nThe anime plot is overall about a guy named Usa who was living with his mom but decided to move out from and ended up living in a complex (building) with four other people. He thought he would live all alone in peace as in being the only one minding his own business but the exact opposite happened. Usa was preparing to move out until he saw Ritsu whomhe fell in love with at first sight which made him change his mind to stay anyway. His goal is to get her attention and build something with her but he struggles because of the other four in the complex who do not want to leave Usa and Ritsu alone so they can get some alone time together as in whenever he success being alone with her then they always end up destroying his hard made progress. There are so much comedy and funny moments and as well of course also cute moments just alone when focusing only on these kinds of scenes in the anime. The best part is, of course, the amazing art which gives it a very high amount of boost for the anime. We cannot really say there is a specific story other than Usa trying to achieve what he wants with Ritsu but it is also a slice of life anime so what do you expect? \\n\\n\r\nPlot 9\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack 8\\n\\n\r\nCharacterisation 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10 absolutely\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf anybody is concerned about the evolving of their relationship then I honestly recommend reading the manga.",

            "content": "Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou was an anime that I've had on hold for quite some time. I watched an episode about a year ago, and then quickly put it off (for reasons unknown to me), and only recently picked it back up. I have to say, I'm quite glad that I did, because this series is pure comedy gold (usually of the more perverse variety), mixed with an adorable romance element that, by the end of the series, leaves you wanting more...much more, in fact.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story revolves around Kazunari Usa (our dim-witted male protagonist) and Ritsu Kawai (our cute introvert with an obsession for literature),who are both residents of the boarding house \"Kawai Complex\". The main focus of the story is on their budding relationship with each other, with Usa trying to close the vast distance between himself and Kawai, who's always oblivious and in her own fictional world. Of course, most of his efforts fail hilariously, in part due to his own ineptitude, but also because of the meddling of his fellow tenants, who just so happen to be complete oddballs.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI personally really enjoyed the art style of this anime. The scenery and lighting is bright and vibrant in color, which creates an upbeat and cheerful tone right from the start. The character designs are all detailed, setting characters apart from each other and giving them all their own unique charm and style. I feel that the male characters weren't quite as defined compared to the females, but overall, they're designs are pretty good, as well.\\n\\n\r\nSounds:\\n\\n\r\nI really can't find anything bad to say about the sounds in this series. The voice acting is fantastic, the OST in general is cute and upbeat which fits the setting and story perfectly, and the ambient sounds (bike pedals, books being thrown, etc) are all realistic and what you'd expect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis is truly the strong point of this series. The interactions between our two lovebirds and the other tenants (read: weirdos) that live in Kawai Complex makes the story into a fantastic romantic comedy. One moment they'll be tearing each other a new one and throwing below-the-belt insults at each other and the next they'll be cheering each other up after a rough day. All the residents of Kawai Complex are very much one big happy dysfunctional family. They're all very unique and eccentric individuals. First we have Shirosaki, who's your average perverted masochist that occasionally offers insightful advice. Next is Mayumi, who is a working woman that has horrible taste in men and hates the sight of happy couples (which often sabotages Usa's efforts towards Ritsu). Then there's Sayaka, the pampered princess whose hobbies are leading on men, destroying her colleges' circles, and harassing Mayumi (which she does in a variety of \u201cinteresting\u201d ways). Lastly is the landlady, Sumiko, who is a cunning and sly older woman that often provides emotional support for the residents of Kawai Complex and helps to resolve disputes (sometimes through force or threats). Now for the two main characters:\\n\\n\r\nUsa is your average, run of the mill protagonist that you've probably seen in dozens of other romance anime. He's dim-witted, slow to catch on and doesn't take hints and social cues very well. He's also too nice for his own good, and has to rely on the residents of Kawai Complex to bail him out of a few situations. He also undoes much of the progress with Ritsu through his own stupidity and sheer density.\\n\\n\r\nRitsu is the shy bookworm type of character who's always engrossed in whatever book she's reading at the time. Although she may initially seem the most normal of the residents at Kawai Complex, she's also quite an eccentric personality, as well. She's a loner who spends the majority of her time reading, and although she's usually alone, she seems to find enjoyment by being by herself. She also has quite the temper, which makes her say the most hurtful things when she's angry. Did I mention that she's a cute cinnamon roll? Because she certainly has that going for her.\\n\\n\r\n Now that we're done with that, let's discuss what I didn't enjoy about this series:\\n\\n\r\n1. I'm gonna be completely honest here, the romance element isn't anything to write home about. It's not that it's horrible by any means, I often found it to be quite endearing, but the relationship between Ritsu and Usa takes far too long to develop. By the end of the series, it feels like they both only reached a small stepping stone towards becoming closer to each other. Don't get me wrong, there is some development between the two, but it's mostly just baby steps. In fact, the story even ends on a sort of climax (if you could call it that) between the two, which is even worse, considering this anime has yet to get a second season.\\n\r\n2. Like many romance and harem anime, the main character in this series is very generic and unlikable. He's a weak lead, to say the least. He does occasionally have his moments, but sadly that doesn't make up for the rest of the time that he spends being completely incompetent and dense. While he's not the worst protagonist that I've seen, he's certainly not the best, by any stretch of the imagination.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou an 8/10. Despite the few issues that I have with it, I can say that I enjoyed it immensely, it's a fantastic example of what a romantic comedy should be. If you want a bright and upbeat anime that will make you laugh from start to finish, and don't mind the romance element progressing at a snail's pace, then this is a series that you'll definitely not want to pass up.",

            "content": "Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou - A pun on the owner's name of the apartment complex, Kawai, with the word 'Kawaisou', which means 'pitful'. It defines well what all the characters in the complex, and even outside it, look like in a first glance, but as you get to know them more and more, you may start to think they are not so pitful. Perhaps you'll find some even hateful.\r\nA brief summary of the characters, starting with the side ones:\r\nShirosaki: A masochist that doesn't hide that information and is fuled with erotic thoughts all the time. He's shown to have a more thoughtful side and tobe kind in certain situations, but most of his purpose is to make Sadistic/Masochist jokes, like breathing rapidly when someone insults him. Basically, a weirdo.\\n\\n\r\nNishikino Mayumi: A big breasted woman in her twenty-somethings that has bad luck - or so she says, but it's her own fault - with men and hates when there's any kind of romance in the air while she wallows alone. If she sees an opportunity, she'll fish for compliments or reactions from men by wearing provocative clothes and showing her cleavage. Also a weirdo.\\n\\n\r\nWatanabe Sayaka: A cute university student that wears a lot of make-up and appears to be kind and gentle, when in reality she loves leading people in the wrong way so she can have some laughs with it. Her main hobby is leading boyfriends to think she is interested in them, then dump them later. A weirdo as well.\\n\\n\r\nKawai Ritsu: An anti-social bookworm, and I really mean a bookworm, who is alone all the time and is bad at expressing herself. She will act on a whim at times, then get embarrassed, run away from the situation, the usual. She is the MC love interest. Perhaps the most weirdo of them all.\\n\\n\r\nUsa Kazunari: The MC that wants to forget his middle school years and start his high school life in peace and quiet, with a girlfriend. He is nice, and as others tell him, too nice. Contrary to what I said about all other characters, he's actually the only non-weirdo. Well, besides getting aroused when his love interest, Ritsu, talks about him even if it's something bad. If he is not thinking of Ritsu or how to get closer to her, he is pointing out all the absurdities the people around him say and do. All events are shown from his point of view, mainly.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is generic; often about something perverted, like making fun of Usa's virginity or how much of a masochist he might be; as is the romance. Main character does many nice things for girl he is interested in, she doesn't notice any of it while it is painfully obvious to everyone around them. So why is it that it was so... enjoyable and fun for me?\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps it was all the weirdness all the characters had and the situations they got themselves in, while never making fun of the weirdness, but rather having fun with it. Maybe it was how mysterious Ritsu's character really is to figure out. She is alone and says she doesn't mind it, but after seeing how she reacts when people show interest in the things she likes, you wonder how true that is. Is she alone because that's how things ended up being and she doesn't mind it, or did she become alone and simply decided to tell herself that it's okay? That she prefers it that way? Maybe it was because you can't help but feel sorry for Usa by being surrounded by weirdos, even though he wanted to avoid them so much.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very pretty and colorful, perhaps too much in some moments, like showing Ritsu's face shining whenever she showed interest in something or when she looks at Usa. There were a bit too many of \"boy protects girl\" events, that I can't help but sigh at. It's a cheap way to make the girl get interested or care about the boy that is way too overused in anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnyhow, although I disliked many characters or situations, I still had a fun time watching Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou. Depending on how much you can tolerate it, and how much you can relate to it, I feel your score can be any number, really. If after the first three episodes you're more annoyed than interested, sighed more than laughed, it's probably not for you. If you laughed and wanted to find more about everyone's weirdness, it might surprise you in some episodes. Either way, I think it's worth a try.",

The unique characters all balance each other with their specific charms and comedy. The occasional meta joke is funny and the series pokes fun at itself using Mayumi and Sayaka. The character development is really great as well. THEN, we get to Ritsu. She is the epitome of a lovable character. The way she is occasionally drawn into the antics really make for great highlights. She is the cherry on the ice-cream that is this series. It isabsolutely satisfying, the music is great, the visuals are beautiful to watch, and everything is great. It is the SoL/RomCom that is very easy to fall in love with. Straying away from its genre all while following its curve. This series definitely has the qualities to be the Anime of the Season in my opinion.\\n",
