            "content": "I can't say for sure what convinced me to stick with Grancrest Senki until the end, but it became a surprisingly good JRPG inspired action-adventure series.\r\nRecord of Grancrest War is, in my opinion, a shining example of how a story can be brought to life remarkably with a talented director. The director Shinichi Omata previously perfected his craft with Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, he\u2019s proven by now that he\u2019s capable at adapting a good source material; plenty of his visual storytelling quirks are visible in the political drama this series offers. Grancrest is quite different from the drama oriented Rakugo in that its story isfantastical and its setting revolves around the battlefield.\\n\\n\r\nIn adapting this different kind of story, Omata employs new methods to realize the more battle-focused structure. However, this adaptation would prove to be a much tougher ambition. The light novel Grancrest Senki was adapted from is quite long, which is the cause of pacing issues in the first half. The plot moved quickly at first, but upon rewatching all 24 episodes at once they're not nearly bad enough to ruin the show. After all, this is a fast-moving adrenaline-pumping battle show, moving from one battle to the next prevents it from growing tiresome. However, the fast pacing does make it hard to keep track of all the characters and plot lines when watching it weekly. This is likely the cause of so much hate for the show, I know it turned me off at first, but giving it a second chance was definitely worth it. I highly recommend watching this series all at once to enjoy the story at its best. \\n\\n\r\nThe story\u2019s premise is relatively simple, Chaos reigns throughout the world and only lords with the power of Crests can stop it. Rather than focusing their efforts to put a stop to the chaos, the lords choose to fight and take one another's Crests because having the power to purify the chaos means control over everyone in the continent who needs protecting. Enter the mage Silica, the series heroine who despises the lords for their greed, through a chance encounter she meets the compassionate wandering knight Theo, seeking to save his homeland. Together they join forces and in a style not dissimilar to a standard JRPG or Dungeons & Dragons, they assemble their party of lords and gradually grow their army. With the goal of unifying the crests and ending Chaos, so more or less world peace, they\u2019re really easy heroes to root for. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't an original story by any means, but it did manage to engage me in spite of this. Not even the fast pacing of the first half could make it difficult to understand what is occurring, although it does help to watch the show consecutively rather than weekly. Rewatching Grancrest after witnessing how it develops in the second half led me to pick up on many details I had initially ignored. The first time I watched it I was mostly disinterested in the plot until the pacing slowed and allowed the main cast time to develop enough to be likable. After rewatching the first half I noticed how despite the cast being incredibly large, the series always makes an effort to give it\u2019s characters motivations. \\n\\n\r\nThe source material is probably more in-depth with backstories and more extensive dialogue, but somehow this adaptation is able to compensate for what it\u2019s missing with fantastic directing. One of the best and most frequent examples of this is during important discussions, the director loves to clue you in on how one of the major characters is reacting. He uses very purposefully uses close-ups to consolidate a subtle emotional reaction at the perfect moment. It\u2019s like how you could praise a joke for being well timed, the close-ups are timed right when a key phrase is said invoking a small but important reaction. Perhaps using close-ups like this is sort of a shortcut in writing, but when you have so many characters to juggle with so little time it\u2019s a very helpful way to keep the audience engaged with the cast. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast themselves are a fairly standard JRPG party with Theo Cornaro as their leader. Theo is your typical nice guy protagonist, except he actually uses the power he gains to make the world better throughout the show. He\u2019s sort of misguided at first; one of his best lines representing this being \u201cWhy can\u2019t we get rid of taxes?\u201d and as usual Silica gently implies that he\u2019s kind of an idiot in the same way a kindhearted little kid is. Even without having the most complex personality, he proves consistently that he is a compassionate person by always putting others ahead of him. Regardless of how high his status rises throughout the series, he doesn\u2019t let himself forget even his foot soldiers. \\n\\n\r\nFrankly, Theo\u2019s simplicity isn\u2019t an obstacle for enjoying the show because he doesn't dominate center stage, he shares it with his partner and eventual love interest Silica, who is a considerably more compelling character. Thankfully Silica is given plenty of agency in the story, she strategizes Theo\u2019s wars with and sometimes for him while he riles up his army with niceness. I hate seeing the love interest character shuffled off into the corner with no pull in the narrative, so Silica\u2019s defiance and individuality are quite refreshing. Their burgeoning romance throughout the series feels incredibly organic, they don\u2019t fall in love because Theo is the guy with the power but out of mutual respect for one another and passion for the same goal. He wants to unite the crests so they can be used to protect everyone and she expresses disdain for the lord's misuse of the crests; they\u2019re a dynamic duo and they have genuine chemistry together in and out of the battles. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the battles, so many battles. I wasn\u2019t prepared for exactly how much fighting would be in Grancrest Senki, but I suppose it does live up to its English title Record of Grancrest War. The battles are how the series progresses its story, similar to the JRPGs that inspired it. If you want an ally, fight them and prove you\u2019re worthy. If you have a disagreement, fight them and prove who\u2019s right. Thankfully, the action is passionately animated. Action scenes are dynamically directed with many different fighting styles used, with different animators hired throughout the series to keep this approach to telling the story refreshing. Even the guy who animated the breathtaking sakuga in Fate/Apocrypha returned to do a few episodes here, and dare I say they fit Grancrest even better thanks to its strong emotional core. There were, however, a few times where the visuals weren\u2019t up to snuff and it was clear they were saving the budget for a grand climax. Other than those low points, it\u2019s visually quite solid.\\n\\n\r\nThe various art styles and animation techniques used to great effect make Grancrest Senki feel more experimental rather than the standard look you\u2019d expect from A-1 pictures. Director Shinichi Omata reminds us of his penchant for well realized dramatic moments with great editing on and off the battlefield. Notably, some of the storyboards used for one of the show's cruelest antagonists Milza are suitably moody with alienating points of view constantly hiding him in shadows. Another great way the villain is portrayed is through the striking thicker lines and his character design being engulfed in darkness aside from his eye and weapon, perfectly conveying the intimidation meant to be felt by the heroes. The visuals superbly define the tone at many points throughout the show; whether it be sweeping establishing shots of lush castles, the dark abstract style to show the presence of chaos, and especially the hopeful horizons illuminated by the setting sun to convey levity after a war. Also, the use of its thrilling orchestral pieces and occasionally uplifting ones do wonders for ensuring emotional beats are on point. \\n\\n\r\nThe most impactful part of the story comes at the very end with the most satisfying and rewarding finale the series could have possibly had. Resolving the conflict in a way that beautifully reincorporates the uplifting themes and previously unresolved character arcs. Although the plot's direction is predictable to anyone who has played a JRPG of its type, what matters is the execution. This isn't some kind of mystery story, although there are plenty of twists and even a couple of shocking betrayals sprinkled in, the story's main success lies in how it's stellar story-telling. I can't say more without spoiling it, but just know that the ending truly feels like a reward for completing the series.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 7/10]\\n\r\nGrancrest Senki\u2019s standard tale of underdogs rising to power is so engaging because of great visual storytelling. If you\u2019re looking for a combat-oriented action-adventure, with plenty of in-depth strategizing, and a romance featuring two compelling leads, then chances are you\u2019ll find this series as enthralling as I did.",

            "content": "***Caution: This review contains spoilers (the specific spoiler discussions will be clearly marked for you to see) so if you can't predict a cliched anime\u2019s cliches, skip the spoiler sections I've marked. Also, do not read this review if you are a Grancrest diehard because it'll probably trigger you, unless if you're objective. If you're neither of these parties, read on with a free mind!***\r\nGrancrest was the first seasonal I picked up in 2018 (not saying much since it released in Jan 6 anyway) and unfortunately my 2018 mean fell right off the bat. Grancrest stumbled out of the gate and fell flat on itsface for the first few episodes and took a long time to get it's footing right. There are different places where I found the show good or bad, which is why I don't consider this show absolutely trash (surprise surprise, not FranXX anyway). So it's first episode started off very conveniently in such that Theo appears out of nowhere, beats the Lord after coming out of nowhere, and picks a somewhat scantily clad girl after as mentioned (not unlike most other isekai or fantasy anime, but I'm not complaining, nothing wrong with fanservice I say :P), coming out of nowhere. Sounds like a rant so I'll tone down for the next bit. \\n\\n\r\nThe show tried introducing it's characters little by little, introducing us to examples like Lassic, Milza among others for the early episodes and introduced others later down the line too. It's always good to see that not all the cast is revealed in its first episode, but unfortunately that didn't help much because we had to make room for our Oh-so-great green haired MC, Theo. Many praised his \u201cbadassery\u201d and his \u201cforward-thinking\u201d and him \u201cnot being dense and weak\u201d and I was terribly confused since none felt true except for his dense part which was randomly and conveniently revealed in a later episode. That is the problem with the show, it's that it's too convenient. \u201cOh Theo is gonna die\u201d but something convenient happens and he's saved. \u201cOh this is gonna happen\u201d but then to benefit Theo\u2019s side it doesn't and the opposite direction is taken. I mean, the show makes Theo out to be like he's the coming of the Messiah or something. He comes, conquers VERY easily, is kind to people (more on that in a bit) and has people serve him in droves. I know it sounds like a rant but to be objective there's nothing wrong with having a righteous MC. It's just that in its current premise I doubt that's what's needed or what makes the most sense. What do I mean? The show is trying to prove that war is dark and to win a war there are sacrifices to be made but Theo goes Yang Wen-Li and wins the war without any well thought out tactics? No thank you. This isn't how you do a war show and definitely not how you make a badass MC. I mean, speaking of Yang, that show excellently shows why war is dark.\\n\\n\r\nWhere there is war there is loss on both sides and this MC is the complete opposite of that. Is there anything wrong with never losing? I don't think so, I mean, a guy like Yang Wen-Li has lost at least once and Theo never did? Don't joke with me A-1. If you're making your MC win as well, MAKE IT BELIEVABLE. Speaking of believable we've got the laughable \u201cbattle tactics\u201d. Once again, it's a show about war so it should have a proper description of what battle tactics are right? WRONG. There is absolutely no mention or any sense in the \u201cbattle tactics\u201d involved and it's just \u201cCharge and win\u201d which I doubt is something that works even 10% of the time, especially when you're constantly outnumbered. A simple \u201cWe'll attack from here and there to trap them\u201d isn't how a battle tactic works. Sense? No, definitely not. Oh and speaking of no sense, we go back to our MC, Theo. To be fair, he did have a decent backstory, I definitely have to give credit where it's due and Theo\u2019s backstory is one that deserves a clap. Just a clap. Why? It's because it was seldom explored after that one episode and they just threw in a pre-show romantic interest and let's just say \u201ctried to be edgy\u201d by giving her one heck of a bombed send-off. And bombs is not the word here. The battle tactics used there as well were close to zilch I'm sad to say. How can inexperienced commoners beat an advanced army? I sincerely apologise because I do not know. Neither did the show. \\n\\n\r\nThen we move to the so called \u201cromance subplot\u201d. It was pretty obvious that Theo would be paired up with Blondie and unfortunately as I expected it wasn't done well. Why does Japan have a hard on for ruining blonde love interests in subplots? (Once again, there are exceptions, we have seen some good blonde love interests in other anime romance subplots before but not as often as one might expect). And this isn't about hair colour here. She was underused and overblown at the same time. She had around 2-3 important lines to say in each episode that were of value, no scratch that, 2-3 important lines every 2 episodes (severely averaged for ease of comprehensive analysis). Her only use was to satisfy the fanboys who already love Theo the \u201cHero\" and want a romance subplot with all the kisses and vows. What if you like me don't like Theo? Zannen-deshoka, you won't be satisfied at all. \\n\\n\r\nYou might say Siluca herself might be able to stand on her own as a character but unfortunately that's not the case with most of the people in the cast. Why? It's because all the characters are cast as stepping stones for Theo-sama to step on and take this place as the best character and biggest badass in this anime. Result? Let's tone down before I turn this into a rant (\u201cwait, it isn't?\u201d I hear you say :P), disappointing. Convenience and stepping stones was the word here unfortunately. Now that I've spewed enough poison over poison, let's calm our nerves down with the plus points of the anime apart from the sadly less explored Theo backstory, the soundtrack. I'd be lying if I didn't tell you I jammed to the second OP each time it played, oh it was so epic. The music selection was needless to say, fantastic, and that's NOTHING to say of the BGM (that's BackGround Music to those who don't know), it was Grancrest's signature achievement. It sent chills down your spine and made you smile in anticipation of what's to come (spoilers: disappointment) and it pumped you up. The visuals thankfully weren't so bad in the OPs and EDs and on a personal note I loved both the EDs. You obviously may not see eye to eye with me but I loved both of them equally and served as an antidepressant for the earlier events of the episode. \\n\\n\r\nNow back to the negatives because I'm out of positives to give, that one scene with Milza and Theo. Since this is a major spoiler so skip approximately 3 lines if you don't want to know about this predictable fight. \\n\\n\r\n***Spoiler begin: The thing is that Milza had given mercy to Theo when Theo didn't ask for it and was about to be killed in the first duel, but in the second and apparently more important one, Theo kills Milza. Nani? Why? What? How? Exactly. I thought they wanted to make Theo look like the next Messiah, what happened here? Well, one could say they wanted to make Theo look badass? I don't even know anymore, needless to say, it was in all literal and figurative sense, a bloody mess. Spoiler end*** \\n\\n\r\nMoving back to the stepping stones, the characters. We go with another spoiler section (will not start immediately so hold on), Alexis and Marrine\u2019s \u201cRomeo and Juliet romance\u201d. Pardon me while I vomit. Okay, let's continue, in terms of anime if you've seen my dropped list I've had the Romeo x Juliet anime at a 2/10 so if you like the story of it in anime form, I don't think you'll hate it so much, unless, if you treat Grancrest like it's equivalent. Romeo and Juliet, the Shakespeare play didn't focus on war as much as the romance, because surprise surprise, it's a romance first and foremost, and another important part is that there's tragedy involved. Does Grancrest follow any of these? No. Why is Marrine and Alexis\u2019 romance related to Romeo and Juliet? Blame the fans, but that's not the issue here. It's that this type of romance won't work in a war show. \\n\\n\r\nI've said this many times in different situations above, Grancrest does a lot of non-war things in a war show and it ruins many of the existing things relative to war shows as well. Going back to the Romeo and Juliet part, some say the Great Hall Tragedy shown in the first scene of the anime counts as tragedy but to that I say \u201cread the original play\u201d. In a later episode, in the final arc, the \u201cfinal battle\u201d which was hyped since the first few episodes that too, went with a POOF. And by POOF I don't mean a bomb. I mean \u201cThe anatomical juxtaposition of two orbicularis oris muscles in a state of contraction.\" As described by Henry Gibbons. In other words, a kiss. Nani? What? Why? When? What happened to the deaths and sacrifices of all those who fought leading up to this event? Why did they hype this battle if this was how it would end? What sort of timing is this??? Marriage? Kiss? Love? Unity? Nothing wrong with all these, but the question remains. If you HAD to follow it this way, then what was the meaning of those previous 20 episodes? Were they to waste? Did they serve as bait? Couldn't this series start off at like episode 16 or 18 and be an OVA? So many questions, and little to no answers. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so, jumping back to the \u201cIt's a war\u201d excuse, in a war you have major character deaths right? Where did the major characters die? Apart from a few minor characters who were obviously forgotten after the next 2 episodes when did we see the death of a main character? Once again, to be fair and objective, there is absolutely nothing wrong with not having major deaths in an anime, I agree, but if you are indeed trying to show that Theo\u2019s side was weak, then why didn't you have important deaths? Yes, the deaths in the first half did exist and they definitely served their purpose, so that's a plus point, but we didn't see anything after that\u2026 Now, a rebuttal to what people might point fingers at my review at, I'll definitely hear the likes of \u201cAlmost all your points against the show are targeting the war aspect of it. You don't know how war shows go. This show isn't about war, it's about blablabla\u201d. Except for that last one which will definitely be used by those who don't even know what the anime is about (please, do not misunderstand, most of you aren't a part of this trope so do not worry), This show is all about war, it's called Grancrest Senki. So it's about war. \\n\\n\r\nAnother example of a \u201cwar show\u201d would be Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, which according to MAL in English is \u201cThe Asterisk War\u201d. My point? Even though their names include the word war (or at least their English counterparts) none of them actually do follow the principles of a war show, less so in Grancrest, since it's whole premise was based on it and that immediately puts it just above Asterisk. So even though Grancrest is about war it rarely sticks to the proper formula of it and no, don't tell me it's a deconstruction, I'll kill you. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, we move on to the last issue of the show which I'll cover, the show\u2019s artstyle. Made by A-1, I expected the show to do okay but it couldn't do that either. Character models looked weak, CGI was used in many scenes (not all), the choreography of the fight scenes themselves were so bad I cringed under my bones and to top it all off, I couldn't find it good at all even at 1080p (yes, I upscaled to 1080p episodes mid-season and still suffered with the artstyle). To go into a little more detail, the character models weren't that eye catchy and to cover for this factor they tried deploying fanservice into the war show to try and make things look attractive (oh fun fact: ever heard of showing your nude body to your army to bolster their morale? Me neither) and I'm not complaining about fanservice (since I love it when used properly) but that it's used in the wrong place and at the wrong time. Perhaps the only \u201cfanservice\u201d that was used at the right time was Siluca\u2019s outfit, which was\u2026 attractive :P\\n\\n\r\nApart from that the fanservice used in the show wasn't done well and A-1 after that episode stopped deploying it and went back to CGI war sequences. Once again to make it clear. I don't have any problem with fanservice, I enjoy Ecchi, it's just that they should be done at the right time, many would say that there's no such specific time for fanservice but I\u2019d say otherwise. If it's not an Ecchi show, don't do random fanservice please thank you. Moving back to the main artstyle, it in simple words wasn't done well for the reasons explained above. \\n\\n\r\n***Spoiler begin: One of the most pathetic and biggest cop outs in the anime was how quickly they changed the villain from Marrine to the Mage Academy. It felt like a ridiculous cop out since the previous episode already ended the whole conflict of the past 20 episodes with a single \u201cI still love you\u201d (oh if only life and war was this easy) and as such this obviously leaves a hugely negative taste in the viewer\u2019s mouth. But wait! There were still 4 more episodes! How ever could they fill them? By adding another villain and acting like \u201cthey were the villain all along\u201d sort of crap. So, the whole 20 episodes of what you watched was for nothing bc Marrine suddenly became good and the last 4 episodes are important because the Mage Academy were the villains all along? They never showed up in the show before though? No mention of them was made and nothing was talked about. Yet they suddenly and extremely conveniently make their appearance to quickly put an end to the cries of \u201cWhat was the point of the past 20 eps???\u201d and from what I can see, that failed spectacularly. They continued with this bullish nature till the end\u2026 Spoiler end***\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone wondering about it's ending, Grancrest\u2019s ending does bring closure. Although on the cliched Shoujo side. It had it's purpose to play. The first half of the episode was as disappointing as you'd expect from the show. But the second half tried to mend those to little avail. Yeah it was cute I could say but such an ending is the same as what happened with the Marrine vs Alexis war\u2026 Not something I'd call amazing but eh, it served it's purpose I guess\u2026 I guess they wanted to follow the fairytale? Either way, Grancrest left me unimpressed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so with a heavy heart I must conclude that Grancrest isn't at all what I'd like to call a \u201cgood\u201d show this year. It's plot was excrutiatingly convenient, the characters were made such that they were stepping stones for Theo, Marrine and Alexis\u2019 romance was horribly handled and had a ridiculously lame \u201cresolution\u201d later on, the Artstyle wasn't what I expected, the battle tactics weren't at all present, the \u201cfinal battle\u201d was a laughable cop out, etc. the show had one or two positive points to it namely the soundtrack that was brilliantly done and Theo\u2019s backstory was somewhat decent. This is all I can say to end on a positive note on this semi-rant and semi-review hybrid, not unlike my Dakara boku wa H ga dekinai review which was done in my old format back when the year started. If you made it till here, thank you for taking the time to read this review and if you do decide to watch Grancrest, please don't expect too much of it because the end result is far lower than that. Most of what you expect from Grancrest can be found elsewhere in shows that are actually good anyway right?\\n\\n\r\nP.S: ***MAJOR SPOILER: Another show where the Hero restores peace to the land eh\u2026 how tiring and cliched. Not that the villain should win but this journey was terrible throughout\u2026 MAJOR SPOILER END***\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2.5\\n\r\nAnimation: 2\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 1.5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2.5\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3.1",

            "content": "Fantasy-genre shows, often times, have the dilemma of getting too caught up in their own facade, resulting in an omission of the basic rules of adequate storytelling (i.e. developing realistic characters and a coherent plot).  Grancrest Senki not only fails on the latter account, it also doesn\u2019t concentrate enough effort on the fantasy itself, instead opting for, rushed, battle scenes with insufficient background knowledge to know why certain events are taking place.  Needless to say, the viewer is left in a state of confusion, wondering why events seem disjointed from one another, and what the purpose of the show is as a whole.Despite these glaring oversights, the show attempts to display a sense of grandeur with its use of magical spells and crest powers; however, it feels rudimentary in its approach, failing to distinguish itself from the crowd of analogous shows that came before its time.  \\n\\n\r\nIt is, in a word: commonplace.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, I would venture to guess that the show\u2019s staff spent more of its time discussing what color a character\u2019s hair, or eyes, should be, rather than determining an interesting way of presenting a strong narrative.  Sure, there are numerous, unforeseen plot twists that produce genuine shock, but they don\u2019t meld well with the ongoing story.  They are, in essence, empty events, lacking necessary substance for the viewer to latch onto, and become empathetic to what is happening on the screen.  To crystallize these claims, look no further than episode nine, a major turning point in the series.  In a scene that is oddly reminiscent of episode eleven in Berserk (the 1997 series), Theo and Siluca take shelter in the base of a tree from precipitous rainfall.  Siluca, unable to control her emotions, confronts Theo about his thoughts towards her, as he admits that he loves her.  Besides being overly-romanticized, their infatuation for one another lacks the appropriate depth to feel authentic.  These two hardly know each other, except for the fact that Theo is a \u201cprodigious\u201d wanderer, and Siluca is a mage who get\u2019s infuriated when other\u2019s stare at her scantily clad outfit \u2014 for god\u2019s sake, just wear something else you whiny tramp.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, that brings me to the next whore, Marrine Kreische.  Being the \u201cclairvoyant\u201d that she is, Marrine decides that she cannot win the war without Mirza (the perpetually angry dude); thus, she passively offers herself to him in a scene that can only be described as inane.  I mean, let\u2019s be honest, she just conquered the entire nation of Starck with little-to-no effort, because of the use of miasma.  Why, then, is it essential for her to have Mirza to the point of having intercourse with him?  Besides being proficient with his sword (hehe), he doesn\u2019t offer much in terms of strategic planning or anything else that requires a modicum of actual thought.  Therefore, her decision to do the nasty with him doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense.  It\u2019s not the content of the scene that I\u2019m enamored with \u2014 as far too many fanboy\u2019s are \u2014 it\u2019s the execution, and the lack of build up to her eventual fall from grace.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, for lack of a better term, is nonsensical, and with each resultant plot twist, the damage becomes significantly worse.  Instead of concocting logical battle plans or implementing the use of military tactics, we see an angry Mirza slashing his sword through countless enemies, as his troops, apparently, watch him as he does so.  Swords glow, blood spills, magic happens, and new characters/countries are introduced with each passing episode; but, ultimately, it\u2019s all window dressing to conceal the vacuous character\u2019s that plague the viewer\u2019s enjoyment.  Investing two minutes of each episode, to chronicle pivotal attributes of each pertinent character would have been time well spent; instead of resorting to cheap fan-service ploys (a-la Queen Eudokia when she \u201cinspired\u201d her troops).\\n\\n\r\nThe omission of narrative flow is evident from the outset, as episodes leap from one critical moment to the next, without ample explanation to bridge the narrative gap.  Simply put: it is a gallimaufry of perplexing events.  The crux of this issue lies with the desire to construct an expansive story with a myriad of nations.  Nothing wrong with striving for breadth in an anime series, but when character\u2019s are glossed over, and battles just seem to a happen \u2014 as if, from thin air \u2014 it becomes frustrating to solve the puzzle that the anime staff was too indolent to solve themselves.  Furthermore, there is no historical context as to why the Factory Alliance and the Fantasia Union are at odds with one another in the first place (let alone the intrusive involvement of the Mage Academy).  We are given a generic explanation that the various Lords want to collect the crests to increase their influence and power.  But, even then, where did the crests come from, and why do they possess such miraculous powers?  Can anyone become a mage, or only certain people?  Why didn\u2019t we hear about the divine beasts until episode 20, and did they rip that concept off from Zelda: Breath of the Wild \u2014 certainly seems like it! \\n\\n\r\nThough, with \u201cinspirational\u201d lines like this, \u201cIt\u2019ll all work out somehow,\u201d from Theo Cornaro, the show\u2019s main protagonist.  It\u2019s not terribly surprising the show left numerous questions unanswered.  In the end, it aimed for everything (mostly through appropriation), yet it was all for naught, as it became the medieval equivalent of an Expendables movie.\\n",

            "content": "War isn\u2019t so bad but it\u2019s what and how it leads to it. It seems in fantasy war stories these days, we rarely encounter a story that isn\u2019t saturated with the most generic tropes possible. Romance, tragedy, revenge, politics. You name it. It\u2019s there. What does that say for a show like Grancrest Senki (Record of the Grancrest War) though? \r\nTo be fair, I\u2019ve never read the original light novels before. It\u2019s written by a guy named Ryo Mizuno who created the Record of Lodoss War series. Even as an anime original viewer, it felt like a series that was easy to jump into. Thepremise isn\u2019t overly complicated as we learn about how war broke loose in the world of Grancrest Senki. Humanity uses Crests that are capable of utilizing magic to deal with supernatural threats such as demons. The most powerful crests are known as Grancrest. Unfortunately, humans are flawed and war broke loose as people seek to gain the most powerful crests themselves. The series chronicles the story of Siluca Meletes and Theo Corano as the two hopes to end the conflict between humanity themselves and defeat the demons. \\n\\n\r\nOk. It's not complicated but as an anime viewer, I\u2019m baffled by the storytelling pacing of the show from the very start. It\u2019s lightning fast that by the time I finished the fourth or fifth episode, it felt like the series jumped way over itself. It would be fair game if the show focused on the story with concrete development but instead, we are introduced with many characters early from the start. Besides Siluca and Theo, the show contains lots of characters of nobility. Aristocrats are a common sight and stands at the high tier of society. On the other hand, there are also characters that dedicates themselves to their own devoted duties such as Aishela, Irvin, and Margaret, and Marrine. Unfortunately, most of these characters have flaws like the way humans do. Some of their decisions in the show are very controversial. Marrine is a prime example in one of the later episodes as she makes a choice that will rub people in the wrong way. \\n\\n\r\nI have attempted to forgive the characters\u2019 choices making as it\u2019s not easy for a show like this to make adequate ones. In other words, how should we judge the characters? Let\u2019s talk about our main protagonists, Siluca and Theo. These two come from different backgrounds but are perhaps the least corrupted individuals in their world. Siluca may be an inexperienced mage but she has a heart of gold. While not as skilled as some others, Siluca is a character with a clever mind although can be forceful at times to get her point across. It didn\u2019t surprise to me that she would sometimes take risks to accomplish her goals. On the other hand, Theo is a man who is perhaps one of the most calm characters in the show. Always keeping his cool and in control of his emotions, it feels like the show designates him as an eventual leader. He also has human morals that are often shown through his actions and words. Often choosing a path with the least violence, Theo does engage in fighting if he feels absolutely necessary. While you could say that these two are perfectly suited for the show, they do make mistakes as well. It\u2019s also inevitable that romance would eventually develop between the two as many hints are dropped in throughout the show. However, unlike most couple pairings, it seems these two really are destined to be together with their similar ideals. This is in contrast with some character pairings such as Marrine/Alexis or Villar/Margaret where fate somehow interferes with their love. Still, the show tries its best to maintain a balanced war story. Romance is actually subtle even with some of the background storytelling such as the one between Marrine and Alexis. In a show like this, I have to admit that throwing in many tropes at once doesn\u2019t help it flow better. It\u2019s like an amalgamation of fictional elements all coming together that may leave viewers feel distracted. The political affairs in the show also feels forced on many occasions despite being necessary for the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nWith 24 episodes, the show\u2019s pacing somehow still takes a stab in the heart. Some episodes are abruptly resolved while others loves to play around with its tropes. The storytelling itself is also predictable with some events that are inevitable to happen. As I mentioned before, there are too many characters that some are just left in the dust and others hardly developed. Aishela is a crime of this as we barely finds out anything about her at all until near the end of the show. By then, I wonder if viewers even cares. Others such as Priscilla and Mirza suffers from characterization as there are hardly any memorable qualities about them. It feels like the author decided to thrown in all sort of characters in at once to make the show feel credible. This even extends to characters with supernatural origins such as werewolves and vampires. Well, I suppose the creators wanted to take that risk but to me, it wasn\u2019t rewarding in the end. With so many characters, Grancrest Senki felt like a play with an overstacked roster where not everyone got their chance to shine.\\n\\n\r\nTo the surprise of no one, A-1 Pictures adapts the show as many of the series have a similar style when it comes to fantasy series. Because this show also involves war and magic, you\u2019ll definitely get a familiarity of what they present each episode. First of all, I would like to say that the animation quality does look sharp especially in early episodes. The action choreography looks smooth and characters are decorated with enough details suitable for this show. However, the character designs themselves leaves little to be desired. Siluca\u2019s ridiculous outfit is a prime example of being distracting to the point that she herself is aware of it. Others such as Marrine and Alexis looks incredibly one dimensional that fits with the nobility stereotype. Oh and of course, fan service exists. There\u2019s skinship in some episodes that leaves little to the imagination while action is shown in brutal uncensored details. To say the least, A-1 did its job but not one that I can confess as impressive overall. The production quality does drop over time in typical A-1 fashion as time passes.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to a few other fantasy war stories I\u2019ve watched, I\u2019d say that Grancrest Senki has a moderate soundtrack. It didn\u2019t set the bar high though as it still sounds very generic even during climatic battle scenes. The theme songs contains the sort of J-Pop style lyrics you probably hear often these days. Character voice mannerisms are moderate at best although I have to admit that certain cast members really sounds motivated. Even Siluca has her own moments that are sometimes worth quoting despite her personality.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Grancrest Senki reminds me of playing a video game where the developer wants you to love what the designed. Truth to be told, I think the show is average at best. It reached its high points in the show on some episodes while making an ill early impression. Quite frankly, there are way too many characters that by the time the show is over, I can only recall a few names. The pacing feel sloppy and really could have improved on many levels. Watch it if you want but be prepare for being underwhelmed.",

            "content": "I have one word for the creators of this show: PACING!\r\nI don't think I've ever seen a show that had so little grasp of how pacing should be done in a form of entertainment.  One episode we're watching a full war scene where every detail is being focused on with flashy fights, decent choreography, and plenty of magic.  The very next will have any battles just skimmed over as \"yeah some people died, here's a 5 second clip of people dying.\"  One episode will go deep into the politics and bonds present in the show, then it switches to either skimming overimportant things or it changes back over to thinking it's an action show.  Pick a speed, and pick a theme to tell your story, don't just mash everything you've got into a pile and call it a tale.  \\n\\n\r\nStory aside, most of the characters are as unbelievable as they can possibly be.  The MC Siluca has the loyalty of a squirrel that's found someone with a nut it wants (other MC: Theo).  Here we have an extremely talented mage who is already setup for fame and fortune throwing it all away to dedicate their entire life to a random stranger they found on the side of the road...what?  Theo is a complete mess of a character as, again, the authors can't seem to decide what he is. Is he naive, is he smart, is he dumb, is he aiming for the top, or is he simply looking to accomplish his goals? You can't make a good character by answering YES to all of the above!\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all of this the story suffers from several elements being shoehorned in for no reason at all.  Why does Siluca wear revealing clothing? Because she was wearing them at the start of the show and is apparently incapable of ever changing them, despite constantly complaining about them and how everyone else leers at her.  Why did we need a sex scene between two people that have never even met before? Yeah, remember the pacing issue?  Five seconds of people dying in a horrible battle for territory, but here's a full timeslot dedicated to watching the two opposing rulers banging each other under the moon simply because he asked.  No reason, nothing added to the story, guy just walks up and says \"I know we're enemies but I want to have sex with you.\" Who wrote any of this and thought it made a single degree of sense?!\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a complete and utter mess, which is a shame as the art is actually pretty good.  The crests and clothing are colorful and really add to the atmosphere of the setting.  Too bad it's only dolling up nonsensical characters and awkward scenes.  The only reason I'm still watching this at all is out of sheer curiosity of where this trainwreck is going to finally stop. \\n\\n\r\n(Written on episode 9)",

The way it is portrayed is not what you would regularly see in animes, infact - it was refreshing. Overall, the only downside was the pacing of the actual story, which had been going all over the place (But it is well within acceptable bounds, you can clearly understand what is going on, and that is what matters most).\\n\\n\r\n-Art (10/10) - Outstanding\\n\r\nI don't need to put many words here, the style and the shading were superb and I do wish to see more shows like this. Overall, it fits well with the story theme and was very pleasant.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound (9/10) - Great\\n\r\nI'm not an expert, but the sounds were Great! not something I will remember by the end of the next year, but they fit the setting pretty well in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment (9/10) - Great\\n\r\nThere was a certain scene that was controversial and caused a lot of spite in the anime community that took up the show,  but for me, that certain scene gave all the more enjoyment to the story in general and opened many more questions for me. It is an emotional ride, and I do believe that a show SHOULD have that sort of impact on you, be it a sad moment or something you feel outraged at; Grancrest Senki definitively had its fair share of squeezing our hearts (for better or worse).\\n\\n\r\n-Overall (9/10) - Personally anywhere between 8.7-9.2\\n\\n\r\nFinally, to address the issue of butthurt viewers. Halfway through the show, there is a certain scene that defines true fans of anime from people that are simply ignorant. That scene will define if you have any respect towards the author and the anime studio that made the anime possible. If you give a bad review solely because of that one scene, then congratulations - you have no respect for someone's hard work and time.\\n\\n\r\nThank you very much for reading my review and I do hope it has touched some (or any) that come across it to pick up the show.",

Ina nutshell, they are basically the anime equivalent of Electronic Arts where they love to pander to the lowest common denominator with the buggy releases, forced micro-transactions, and overall shallow games.\\n\\n\r\nRecord of the Grancrest war along with Darling in the Franxx which is mainly a A1 show mind you are the latest A1 shows to come out from A1\u2019s dog collars to deliver us two seasonal anime train-wrecks in order to once again please the lowest common dominator of anime with the atrocious writing, bland tropey characters, subpar art and preachy themes.\\n\\n\r\nLike with most A1 productions I kept my expectations very low because honestly the moment I praise a show from A1 the show would go back to its awful roots by having a stupid plot twist that completely goes against the narrative that has been previously been set up in previous episodes to having creepy and horrible sex scenes\u2026 Needless to say, I and my good friend decided to marathon this train-wreck of a show and by the end of it, we were shocked of how bad it was to a point where I actually one of A1 worst shows. Now with that, all said Hello everyone this is Shawn aka PhantomKurata and welcome to my review of Record of the Grancrest war and with that said let\u2019s dive into this train-wreck shall we.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nAtlatan, a land ruled by\u00a0Chaos. Fearing disaster brought about by chaos, the people lived protected by \u201cLords;\u201d those with the power of \u201cCrests,\u201d used to suppress the chaos. However, the Lords decided to abandon the concept of protecting the people and turn against each other, stealing each other\u2019s Crests to gain dominion over one another. The story follows Siluca a young mage who scorns the feuding lords for abandoning their people. One day she meets a wandering swordsman and Crest holder Theo\u00a0who is trying to liberate his hometown from its tyrant lord. Seeking for an opportunity Siluca helps Theo raise his rank to a knight as well forming a contract with him. Joining forces, Siluca, Theo and their allies fight together to end the war between the different noble factions, and put an end to the threat of Chaos.\\n\\n\r\nLike with most A1 productions they all have great concept and ideas on paper, however, A1 Pictures has the really nasty habit of taking things that have great potential and decides to screw it all up in actual execution and Record of Grancrest War no different.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in Record of Grancrest War is only interesting if you have never seen any action fantasy anime in your life because it\u2019s one of the most generic run of the mill fantasy story that there is. A character starts off as a nobody but as soon as he gets invited to set army and trains for a while he became one of the strongest characters from the army. All of the fantasy cliches are present here.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing is poor at best as it features a lot of questionable acts that go happened within the show, for example, the end of episode 9 where the alliance Marrine wanted to meet with Lord Milza so they can perform a ritual together by having sex in the open of a countryside. What the hell were you thinking A1 Pictures? It\u2019s bad enough that they have sex in the open where at anytime they can get shot down by arrows by any faction but the way Marrine was acting during that sex act was incredibly disturbing and made me feel uncomfortable. I don\u2019t sex scenes in anime but they A1 Pictures does them is creepy and forced. I hope to god that A1 Pictures will never animate a sex scene ever again because these incompetent bastards don\u2019t know the meaning of sex.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me started with this shows directing because I have never seen a war fantasy show that skips fights/battles and a great example of this was in episode 17 where the Kilhis army focus was planning to attack the Dartanian \u00a0army and instead of showing the whole battle as soon the leader puts on the golden mask on the show fades out and the next shot\u00a0 we see that the Killhis forces were defeated and to add insult to entry the leader info-dumps all the events that happened in the battle instead of showing us the battle\u2026 WHY JUST WHY. I understand the show wanted to establish of how powerful the Dartanian army is but this was the cheapest way to do it. It\u2019s like they clearly ran out of budget just for that scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing from this show that single-handily killed the show was the pacing. The pacing in Record of Grancrest war is way too fast for its own good. It\u2019 was okay in the beginning but it really became a big problem as the series goes on and because of the shows fast pacing almost all of the things that go on in the show feels incredibly rushed. The perfect example of this show awful pacing is with Theo character progression. In the beginning of the series, the show establishes that he is a sloppy fighter who cannot defend himself but in a couple of episodes later he suddenly becomes an expert fighter as well a ruler of his own lead who is very capable of taking over mutable lands. The sad part is thanks to the shows fast pacing we barely got to see any character development and growth from Theo at all.\u00a0 This was single-handily Record of the Grancrest war biggest mistake and because of that the show became an insufferable train-wreck most A1 productions\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story for Record of Grancrest Senki is just awful.\\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nLike with the story the characters are only interesting if you never seen a fantasy anime before because they are all just generic fantasy characters that we all seen before.\u00a0 Am not trying that having generic characters in a fictional work is bad because generic characters can actually be likable and charming if done right. The problems is apart from Siluca all of the characters in Record of the Grancrest war are all generic and one dimensional who have no charm at all.\\n\\n\r\nTheo is your typical fantasy lead that we all seen before other fantasy animes in the past. His character development is nearly non-existent thanks to this show pacing issues and his personality is boring.\\n\\n\r\nSiluca is a pretty decent female lead overall. She\u2019s strong, likable, and just very enjoyable to watch. It\u2019s such a shame that she\u2019s not really the main focus because she could have been a great character if Theo didn\u2019t exist. Now if I think about it Theo existence completely hold this character back from being great as she kinda devolves as a character as the series goes along where she just wants to lick on Theo\u2019s dick. Such a shame really because she could have been a great character.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters in Record of Garncrest War are just your generic fantasy characters that we all seen before and they are not even worth mentioning due to how one note all of them are including the villains.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters in Record of Garncrest War were really bad and forgetful.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the visuals of Record of Garncrest war I thought the visuals were pretty alright for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters designs are pretty decent overall especially for the females who have the best designs in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe fan-service in this anime is pretty tolerable for the most, however, the anime at times can get carried away with the fan-service but least it not as bad as\u00a0The Asterisk\u00a0Wars and Eromanga Sensei.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that I didn\u2019t like about the art is how inconstant it is from character going off model in various scenes in the show to awkwardly use of CGI in many scenes in the show. The animation is passable for the most part however it had its fair share of still frames in many areas as well as some awkward shots.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the visuals of Record of the Garncrest war is decent for the most part.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nLike with most A1 Productions the soundtrack is easily the best part about these shows and Record of the Garncrest war is no different.\\n\\n\r\nBoth opening and ending themes of the show were pretty good overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty good for the type of show that it is and I have no complaints whatsoever. \\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nRecord of the Grancrest War is one of the worst directed show I have ever seen from this genre.\\n\\n\r\nIt was very boring to watch and it made me wish I was watching other fantasy names. The story is shallow and poorly written. The directing and pacing was beyond trash, most of the characters were sucked and the animation was subpar. The only decent things about this show were the visuals and music.\\n\\n\r\nLike with most A1 Productions it should be thrown in the dumpster where it should be destroyed. If you like Record of Grancrest War and any A1 production than good for you but don\u2019t go out there and say that A1 is a great anime studio because you will only piss off more experienced anime fans such as myself. Don\u2019t get me wrong I like a couple of A-1 shows like Black Butler Book of Circus/Murder, Woatkoi, Magi and Shinsekai Yori but for every A-1 show that I like these always a bunch of A1 shows that I hate like Eromanga Sensei, The Asterisk\u00a0Wars, Fate Apocrypha, Sword Art Online etc.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t recommend this show to anyone unless you want to see how incompetent A-1 Pictures is as a studio for the 20th time.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully, the PS4 game will be better.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 2.5/10",

            "content": "Having only watched 8 episodes of this I have to say that the show feels rushed. It's only 6 or 7 eps in that it finally has enough set up for it to really tell its story. \r\nThe male MC is a typical commoner-with-a-will. Past that and he is quite flat for some time, ep 5 is where he actually starts to make his own plays. \r\nThis show is not a battle show, the rushed first 4 epis are to get the MCs into a political location where they have enough there to have stakes in that arena. That being said, I am finding myselfhaving to pay extremely close attention to every single line of dialogue and every action much closer than I normally would. \\n\\n\r\nNow that the show is into the political end of the spectrum it can drop a lot of the shorthand that it had been using to set everything up. Theo is effective in this in that he is as unaware of the politicalscape as the audience while actually being from the setting (avoiding isekai hell) \\n\\n\r\nOur other MC is trained from a very young age to be politically savvy as well as having potent magical skill. Her own goals align with Theo's but go considerably farther than his did in the beginning, having her be fresh out of school and thus socially unaware of the world, gives us the audience a good glimpse into the society in the setting as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nNow that we are past the ground block world building, we are looking at the political alliances that the MCs have found themselves entwined in. Where the focus has shifted off of our handy short-hand characters to much more rounded nobility who are rife with problems. \\n\\n\r\nKnowing that this series has 24 epis really helps in gauging the final scope. \\n\\n\r\nAs this is a review, I will say that their execution of plot is adequate. You have to really look into what is going on to get it, but the plot is there. It's just not focused on the same thing as most anime are. Battles are not the climax of this plot. They are used to further it, as examples of what the war looks like, as ways to show how each of the Lords acts in combat to their own ideals, ethics, and codes of conduct. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is adequate, not top tier, and not utter shit. I have no opinion on the soundrack or use of music, so it's doing its job. \\n\\n\r\nI am finding myself enjoying this show quite a bit despite its flaws. \\n\\n",

            "content": "tbh. theres nothing special about this series. \r\n-the settings is pretty much similar with the other typical Advanture-Fantasy series. bringing peace to the land or saving/changing the world from a certain condition, advanture party, magic-user,non-human being existance and some \"trademark elements\" in this series its the \"Crest\".\r\n-the plot is proceeding toward the partial cases that will lead to a certain happy ending(theres nothing wrong with the happy ending, the audience/fans/readers etc deserve it).\r\n-you probably could guessed out most of the plot since its not confusing at all instead its pretty much straight but just to alert yourself of some unexpected twist(since we dont know whatreally will happen when blind watched some things) for example:episode 9(not twisted at all but quite fast)\\n\\n\r\ni LIKED this series. cause for me Anime is an Entertainment something to entertain you. was it enjoyable for you or not. and i did enjoy it, it gives me the hype and fun even tho you know that you already watched/readed lots of series that have the similar settings like this while you cant help but NATURALLY feel that you actually enjoyed it. and it became one of my most anticipated weekly episodes in Spring 2018 because i cant wait to see the plot proceed further even tho i didnt read the LN and kind of imagined how it will ended it still give me the Thrills from the plot. you know this would happened you know that would happened and when it happened you didnt feel dissappointed at all instead you enjoyed the ride.\\n\\n\r\n^THIS IS JUST MY OPINION. im a plot-lover i didnt love them just so that i can critics them, i love them for the Thrills on how they play with my heart. it brings me tears, it brings me joy, it sometimes make me feel sad, happy, angry, down, suspensed, frustrated, hyped anything you named it, its bring lots of emotions out of me. and i did enjoyed this series my heart did played along with it.  in the end all that matters is for you to enjoy it. \\n\r\n-if you feel like you cannot enjoyed it you can dropped it.\\n\r\n-if you feel dissappointed in it you can dropped it.\\n\r\n-if you feel angry that its so pathethic you can dropped it.\\n\r\nits fine as long as you didnt enjoyed it. cause good or not if you enjoyed something you will watch it or follow it, you will stop if you stop enjoying it. cause that is the main purpose afterall, that is for us to enjoy the entertainments that were created for us.\\n\\n\r\nSimple Summary:Arts-above average. Characters-typical and too much blondie(no offence), Siluca look really similar with Marrine. but some F.Characters have good appeal thank you for that. Animation-too normal and become weirder during action. Adaptation-badly adapted you could tell from the plot that they skipped so much things from the source. and theres no Siluca back story with Aishela.\\n\\n\r\nITS GOOD IF YOU LIKED IT, ITS ALSO FINE IF YOU DONT LIKED IT EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN PREFERENCE. ANYWAYS THANK YOU MIZUNO RYO FOR THE GRANCREST SENKI SERIES. IT DID GOT PLACE IN MY LIFE, I ENJOYED IT THANK YOU.\\n\\n\r\nStory:7\\n\r\nArt:6\\n\r\nSound:5\\n\r\nCharacter:4\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\nOverall:8",

            "content": "Just another typical anime , add a pretty low score to that and you get grancrest senki But (and this is a big one) it kinda feels like something that is trying to be different yet does it succeed or not ? \r\nFirst let me say that there are some controversial views on this show the reason being what happened halfway through but to be honest they should've added the gore genre to the list so  that people knew what they were getting in to.\r\nThat's right it has some elements of the gore genre , to be precise some lots of it and ifyou are not into that concept you shouldn't be watching it. The +17 sign should be considered as well since it really is kinda +17.\\n\r\nWith those being said I'll move to the anime itself : \\n\r\nWe have the story first probably the weakest part of the anime but not that bad to make the whole thing worthless , it would've actually been a good story if the pacing was controlled and some explanations were given along plots but with the current plot holes you shouldn't expect much of it. If you lower your expectatins it would be an enjoyable show to watch (binge watch).\\n\r\nThen we have the art , since A-1 is behind grancrest senki one would think of an average art at the very least and I must say they have done a pretty good job on the art. Its far from perfect but there are some scenes you want to pause and just look. The sound and background music go really well with the emotions and scenery depicted so that's a plus. The music and opening and ending themes are done really epic and go along really well with the anime.\\n\r\nNext up are the characters , being one of the things I enjoy in the anime there are many different characters and personalities in grancrest senki , yes there are some typical stuff but overall it is really enjoyable seeing this many characters with different feelings which are actually relatable to some extent and help you enjoy the show as it is.",

            "content": "Warning: this series turns into something else entirely at episode 9. Prior to episode 9 I gave this series a solid 6. Nothing great but a fun story that was nice to kill a little time. \r\nEven before episode 9 the anime really fit into one of those awkward spots where it's not bad... but everything is done just a little bit wrong.\r\nFor example the action is good... except since we rush through every battle it's hard to be invested into most of it so it's actually a bit boring except for the occasional badass moment but even that's a bit wasted by the pacing.\r\nThesetting is good ... but a lot of it is just skimmed over and a lot of it isn't getting properly addressed. .\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are good ... but because of how the series chooses to divide it's focus they often do things for poorly explained or no reason. In order to avoid spoilers I'll just say the entire war has a feeling of pointlessness as the path to peace seems relatively easy but the characters able to do so choose not to because ... well the show needed a plot somehow.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of issues with the series come from it's pacing but besides the pacing itself it's presentation and focus are lack luster as well.\\n\\n\r\nBut again even with all this considered it still had a fun tone that kept it a nice watch... then it suddenly turns insanely brutal episode 9 to the point the series isn't even recognizable. Don't mistake this as meaning the show improved either. The pace is still a mess and the presentation and focus are still poor. But while before it was midly forgivable as a light hearted adventure that didn't need a lot of depth now it's a full scale bloody war series that feels hollow.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists are entirely unlikeable as their actions are needlessly brutal and psychotic but seemingly presented in a way that feels like the show wants the audience to sympathize with them.\\n\\n\r\nThis leaves a rather bad taste as many likeable characters die for the sake of a war that didn't even need to happen based off of what the series itself has stated.\\n\\n\r\nI really don't recommend this to anyone as if you like the first 8 episodes you'll start to hate the series 9 onwards and if you are the type that likes 9 onwards it's not worth forcing yourself through the first 8 to get to. There are other anime that do brutal wars better so there is no need to waste time on this.",

            "content": "I have watched almost 200 anime. There were better and worse ones. I have few that are my favourites but when I finished Grancrest Senki yesterday I was super happy that I had a chance to watch this one.\r\nOverall I can say that it was amazing story, full of action, magic, battles, creatures and romance. For me MC and his mage were really nicely done (however Silica should have more screen time)  along with a lot of other characters like Shadow, twin werewolves, valkyrie, vampire lord, black witch and few lords. Draw style was really nice, music was good but not superb.\r\nWhat I alsoliked about this anime was that there were no hentai/echhi elements and instead we had a lot of drama but not so much like in Akame ga kill. Characters are not overpowered (maybe in fight with the cyclop...), they are humans which can easily die.  I was kinda worried about MC and Silica at the end (japanese creators love to kill some MC or make them disappear forever) because I like happy endings. However the ending was really nice (yet final fight with the Artist was kinda boring).\\n\\n\r\nI can recommend this anime to everyone. For me - best anime I have ever watched - 10/10 :)",

            "content": "The art is no doubt good backed by A-1 and nowadays making anime is a lot cheaper and easier than before. This show started off decent, but it was rough and seemed like it could take it somewhere. I read another review about the pacing being too fast or too slow at parts, that comment is totally true. The show starts up and the first 4 episodes go crazy fast. You think the directors and authors are pulling a Samurai Champaloo thing where the main characters are already op (maybe not the best comparison but thats all that came to mind), but it moves fasterthen those crappy magic high school animes that are all the same with slight differences. I did not fully enjoy the show starting it, but it looked interesting and the characters could go somewhere. The romance is very forced and you are made to believe it,(another bad example coming up) its a failed attempt at introducing romance that is slightly believable. I haven't seend Clannand or what every but I have seen My High school Romantic comedy SNAFU (aka Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku) and that romance was as always childish as all slice of life romcoms are, but they got you to believe it. See if you want that love between Theo and Meletes to really show love and the power of love make it believable and develop it. Yes lie is in believe but doesn't mean its gotta be fake. And this is as someone who is not a weeb or otaku and somebody who hates this type of thing,\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \\n\r\nOkay here I want to take a breather and calm myself down before I go all out. This show has a nice main character Theo/Siluca I like Theo, he is not half bad. The show carried itself decently at the begin and it seemed like it was gonna be political, but delve into the characters more. Then the road block of bringing in politics is that you have to introduce all these characters and you want to make it make sense and make characters come off as cool and smart. They have focused alot more on everybody except the main characters, Theo and Siluca so far. The anime still has ability to make itself better and offer less empty space and change its paced to something better. Don't toss this anime right away as you have to understand some of the character creation is average and it seems as this show is being rushed from the studio. Its decent and if more time was put into the characters and the characters it could go from a 3 for characters to a 6 or 7. So if it hasn't scared you away stay tuned,because it almost had me scared. \\n\\n\r\n SPOILER SPOILER GOING TO RUIN A SPOILED SHOW AND WANT YOU TO KILL THE AUTHORS\\n\r\n*\\n\r\n*Spoiler in 4 more stars\\n\r\n*\\n\r\n*\\n\r\n*\\n\r\n*\\n\r\nMARRINE AND MILZA WHY DOES THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN WHAT VALUE DOES IT GIVE.

            "content": "(WARNING: a bit of spoilers up ahead)\r\nSo this is another generic, medieval-like fantasy show with the usual dense male protagonist and everything basically rigged with comedy and awkward RPG-like vibes, as well as the clich\u00e9 transitions of the mc easily making companions throughout the journey. This is the kind of series that usually just starts okay, progresses badly, and ends awful, for the most part.\r\nWell\u2026for the first 6 or 9 episodes, it seemed that way, at least. However, for me at least, it actually turned out to be a lot more than what meets the eye. Granted, this series still had its flaws in termsof the usual gigs with most fantasy / magic anime series. In short, this series is actually good, but it\u2019s understandable why many people would either hate or ignore it, considering the amount of attention that other shows are getting during the seasons of Winter and Spring 2018 in anime.\\n\r\nSTORY: Okay, this is the main bugaboo that this series has, above all other things: PACING. Even as a two-cour series, the pacing feels really off, and the important events in the shows are often rushed and skim on certain details, especially when many of the battles feel like they end too quickly and/or easily. In fairness, this was probably done on purpose due to the fact that this series might not get a second season in the near future, if at all, due to undisclosed reasons that only the directors would know.\\n\r\nThere is the nice perk with this series, though. Instead of feeling like a very clich\u00e9 and boring story where the typical dense protagonist goes through the story with not much significant adversity or hardship, this show took quite an interesting turn, for better or worse, depending on the subjectivity of the viewers. After what felt like an easy \u201cwalk in the park\u201d for the main hero, the whole situation literally turned into a Game of Thrones, where all the kingdoms tried to assert dominance over the other, instead of focusing on the true villainous group pulling the strings. In many cases, the very good and the very bad were brought out in many of the characters involved in the conflicts\u2026.so much for smooth sailing for the mc. There were also painful sacrifices and exposures to reality that I really thought made the plot more compelling than other people may think. Another thing I like to point out is that the show doesn\u2019t really have much comic relief, if at all; to me, this is actually a good thing because the comedy would feel very out of place considering the story\u2019s progression.\\n\r\nGranted, the story still ran into issues during the second half, as it still felt too easily wrapped up, especially in how they switched up antagonists down the stretch. I cannot say for sure if the possibility of a second season may do the story enough justice, but personally, I do give credit that the series did have an actual conclusion instead of being open-ended. Needless to say, though, as aforementioned, the pacing of the story could\u2019ve been handled a lot better.\\n\r\nANIMATION: Love or hate A-1 Pictures all you like, but regardless, these guys really know how to put together some hella fine animation. While the animation is not quite so smooth in terms of movement, it is not entirely awkward and doesn\u2019t try to do stuff like adding bad CGI scenes in. I do want to point out something that may or may not be offputting to some people. During some battle scenes, particularly the battle against the Cyclops, the animation may look very sloppy to many viewers. However, I personally think, though can\u2019t confirm, that A-1 pictures is probably trying to animate those scenes in a somewhat similar style that studio Trigger would utilize. When scenes like that are animated in that fashion, they\u2019re supposed to keep you glued to the action. Granted, A-1 Pictures may not produce the best thing in the world in terms of animation quality, but they sure are consistent despite any infamous reputation they may get.\\n\r\nSOUND: Honestly, the soundtracks for this series are really good; for me, the opening and ending themes (except for the first OP, which is still not bad) are amazing. Sure, the soundtracks in this show overall may not be the most grandiose of things, but they really fit whenever needed, especially during the emotional and/or tense scenes, like the battles and the glorified deaths of some of the characters. There\u2019s not much else to say here, since taste in music really varies from person to person, in the end.\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: First things first\u2026.Theo Cornaro, the male protagonist, isn\u2019t the generic kind of male character that you\u2019d think he\u2019d be. Forget about the typical protagonist who hesitates to even touch a woman, much less think about a romantic relationship\u2026this guy not only reciprocates the main heroine\u2019s feelings for him (he kisses her more than once without hesitation, even in open public\u2026that\u2019s alpha shit right there LOL), but he even thought about the future of the romantic relationship as well. While it may seem that the MC is too calm and collected, he is actually not just some overpowered dude\u2026he really has had to rely on carefully planned-out strategies and tactics as well as the support from his companions/allies/friends. Yes, he does have some plot armor, but nowhere close to being the obnoxious kind that you\u2019d see in other male protagonists like Kirito from SAO, Ichigo from Bleach, and Sasuke from Naruto. He is also a pacifist, which is personally my favorite kind of character, which means he wants to avoid killing whenever possible, and if not, reduce the amount of blood shed no matter what.\\n\r\nThe female protagonist, Siluca, isn\u2019t just some helpless damsel-in-distress or obnoxious, prideful tsundere bijin. While she is unfettered with her goals and can be arrogant at times, she is shown to be a kind, polite, and understanding person\u2026she is also pretty smart as well, compared to most female heroines. I do also like she doesn\u2019t let her romantic relationship with Theo cloud her judgment and/or interfere too much with military and political matters.\\n\r\nThe main supporting cast have some very interesting qualities and personalities, even if they\u2019re considered clich\u00e9 by many people. A bunch of them actually do get a good amount of spotlight compared to support cast characters from other similar shows; at some points, the focus on some of those characters was so concentrated that I often briefly forget that Theo and Siluca are still the main characters in the show. A pet peeve I did have is that I wished that the sub-villain, Marrine, would be punished for her actions during the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d conflict, but when I considered from every perspective as to why she wasn\u2019t given brutal judgment, I can at least understand why she was spared. Honestly, if certain characters do really despicable things to really piss off the viewers on an emotional level, the show is doing shit right, imo, even if some viewers end up hating the show JUST because of that. Overall, the character department was well handled, though of course could\u2019ve been better.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I didn\u2019t really enjoy the show much during the first 6 to 9 episodes, but once the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d situation commenced, my interest perked up, cause I thought the journey was just gonna be the MC going to city after city in a simple one-way road and eventually bringing widespread peace after defeating the final boss\u2026but uh-uh, it was a bit more complicated than that. A lot of personal enjoyment also came from watching Theo reciprocate Siluca\u2019s feelings and even assert their relationship for everyone to see. I hate Milza and Marrine for what they did during the majority of the show, but I still think it counted as my enjoyment for the show, cause the buildup and payoff to see at least one of them meet their demise was quite satisfying. While I wasn\u2019t totally agreeing with Marrine being spared, to this day, I commended Theo staying true to his ideals to the point where he\u2019ll even spare his enemy. I also really enjoyed the battles, even as rushed as most of them were. Contrary to many people, I was quite okay with how the final confrontation wrapped up, even though I also knew it was hastened\u2026maybe I was because I already accepted that it was inevitably going to be stricken by poor pacing, anyways, and that there\u2019s no point in nitpicking about that.\\n\r\nOVERALL: I would honestly recommend this series to anyone who likes medieval-like fantasy shows, in general. Even with the bad pacing of the show, it\u2019s still a solid series overall\u2026several years ago, this show probably would\u2019ve gotten higher regards, imo. I\u2019ve seen plenty of other similar shows with higher ratings from 7.2 to 8.5 out of 10\u2026.that I thought really don\u2019t deserve those kinds of grades at all, tbh. My piece of advice would be to binge watch it, though, due to how fast the story progresses. If you still don\u2019t like it due to the obvious reasons, I can completely understand\u2026maybe this isn\u2019t the show for you\u2026perhaps you would\u2019ve liked fantasy shows with comedy and slice-of-life stuff, I guess. Even then, you\u2019ll still enjoy it by criticizing what you think it did wrong\u2026that still counts as enjoyment, right? In short, Grancrest Senki is a series with understandable flaws, especially as an LN adaptation, but not even halfway close to being a worst of the worst.\\n",

WARNING!\r\nPacing: \r\nWhere do I begin! The pacing of the anime is horrendous considering that this anime is projected to have 24 episodes. The story line moves so fast that you won't be able to remember what is going on. \r\nSummary of Plot:\r\nThe story is alright. It revolves around a young knight, Theo who tries to retake his homeland with the aid of a mage. \r\nCharacters:\r\nSome of the worst and dumbest characters you will ever see. One does not have sex with other people they don'tlike. One does not give up title in the name of love. One does not be brave and watch his girl suffer. One does not act like a wimp when he is king. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/5\\n\r\nThere are scenes of consensual rape. Girl falls in love with dude but has sex with another. Yeah, I didn't enjoy it after that. However, the MC is one of the smoothest MC you will ever see. His romance is pretty good in terms of anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nThe anime pacing leaves it hard for any watcher to steadily follow without having to hit playback. The artwork makes it easier  to watch but often music covers the sound of the anime. Characters are soft or stupid and there is no perfect one except the MC. I suggest to do better use of your time but I can't make you so just be warned. I tried my best to like this anime but I can't. \\n\\n\r\nLastly just read the Manga or LN because it is far better.\\n",

            "content": "So I've kept up with Gancrest Senki on a weekly basis as it's been released. And from what I've seen many of the reviews are of the first 2-5 episodes or so. And simply put, these reviews are not fair.\r\nThe story has a VERY odd start. Which seems to be the cause of many of the poor reviews. Yes the pacing is weird, and characters seem a little, everywhere... sometimes. But I've honestly been super interested in how the story has developed. There is a large cast so far and it has been an odd mix of supernatural (vampires, were-wolves and chaos demons), military, andpolitical. Some episodes are devoted almost entirely to the interactions of a few political leaders and the maneuvering, betrayals and diplomacy that occurs, while others are focused around the military conquest. And some pretty bad-ass fight scenes!\\n\\n\r\nThe MC should not truly be considered MC's at this point, as the plot is driven by the much larger political world that Gancrest Senki is set in, and I've personally been really drawn into seeing how this world develops!\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that this show does which i'm personally really liking is it is quite creative. Characters really begin to find their pacing and once the backstory for them is set their actions begin to make a lot of sense, even if the overall 'plot' is still being discovered. \\n\\n\r\nI really would hate to see this show suffocate and die before it can even begin. Sure it may absolutely flop, that's very much within the realms of possibility. BUT there is also a chance that this could be a really incredible show. Some of the BEST animes EVER MADE have really hard to watch starts that are confusing and slow. Think FMA, Steins Gate, hell even Gintama is hard for a lot of people to get into. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR:\\n\\n\r\nIF YOU'RE UNSURE ABOUT THIS ANIME, WAIT TILL ITS FULLY RELEASED AND THEN BINGE WATCH IT.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

(Not going to be a long full depth review)  \r\nMany people have compared the show to Record of Lodoss War, but as someone who has not watched this show here is an outsiders\u2019 opinion. I originally rated Grancest Senki an 8, but after the series finished and I had time to think about the anime I've revised that back down to a 7. Honestly, I feel that this show should have been split into 2seasons. \\n\\n\r\nThe show for me starts pretty slow, around mid-season is where I got really invested. I enjoyed the main characters development, the relationship that grew and the pacing the show had. The art style for me is good, it isn't however the best and the main plot of the story is pretty standard. Some of the moral questions of the show and the ways many characters go about protecting/gaining their goals/values I did enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nThe latter parts of the season is where things fell apart for me. After around ep 18/19 the pacing feels off, things really start the get moving and the whole viewing experience feels rushed. I know publishers only have a certain number of episodes to finish the story, but after the slow beginning and enjoyable paced mid-season this fast-paced ending does kind of annoy me. If this wasn't the case and everything was kept consistent i would of given the show a solid 8/10. However, after finishing it and giving it a bit of thought I'm going to have to give it a 7/10. Is the show enjoyable/entertaining? Yes. Would I recommend the show? Yes. Is the show a masterpiece? No. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I can't say for sure what convinced me to stick with Grancrest Senki until the end, but it became a surprisingly good JRPG inspired action-adventure series.\r\nRecord of Grancrest War is, in my opinion, a shining example of how a story can be brought to life remarkably with a talented director. The director Shinichi Omata previously perfected his craft with Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, he\u2019s proven by now that he\u2019s capable at adapting a good source material; plenty of his visual storytelling quirks are visible in the political drama this series offers. Grancrest is quite different from the drama oriented Rakugo in that its story isfantastical and its setting revolves around the battlefield.\\n\\n\r\nIn adapting this different kind of story, Omata employs new methods to realize the more battle-focused structure. However, this adaptation would prove to be a much tougher ambition. The light novel Grancrest Senki was adapted from is quite long, which is the cause of pacing issues in the first half. The plot moved quickly at first, but upon rewatching all 24 episodes at once they're not nearly bad enough to ruin the show. After all, this is a fast-moving adrenaline-pumping battle show, moving from one battle to the next prevents it from growing tiresome. However, the fast pacing does make it hard to keep track of all the characters and plot lines when watching it weekly. This is likely the cause of so much hate for the show, I know it turned me off at first, but giving it a second chance was definitely worth it. I highly recommend watching this series all at once to enjoy the story at its best. \\n\\n\r\nThe story\u2019s premise is relatively simple, Chaos reigns throughout the world and only lords with the power of Crests can stop it. Rather than focusing their efforts to put a stop to the chaos, the lords choose to fight and take one another's Crests because having the power to purify the chaos means control over everyone in the continent who needs protecting. Enter the mage Silica, the series heroine who despises the lords for their greed, through a chance encounter she meets the compassionate wandering knight Theo, seeking to save his homeland. Together they join forces and in a style not dissimilar to a standard JRPG or Dungeons & Dragons, they assemble their party of lords and gradually grow their army. With the goal of unifying the crests and ending Chaos, so more or less world peace, they\u2019re really easy heroes to root for. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't an original story by any means, but it did manage to engage me in spite of this. Not even the fast pacing of the first half could make it difficult to understand what is occurring, although it does help to watch the show consecutively rather than weekly. Rewatching Grancrest after witnessing how it develops in the second half led me to pick up on many details I had initially ignored. The first time I watched it I was mostly disinterested in the plot until the pacing slowed and allowed the main cast time to develop enough to be likable. After rewatching the first half I noticed how despite the cast being incredibly large, the series always makes an effort to give it\u2019s characters motivations. \\n\\n\r\nThe source material is probably more in-depth with backstories and more extensive dialogue, but somehow this adaptation is able to compensate for what it\u2019s missing with fantastic directing. One of the best and most frequent examples of this is during important discussions, the director loves to clue you in on how one of the major characters is reacting. He uses very purposefully uses close-ups to consolidate a subtle emotional reaction at the perfect moment. It\u2019s like how you could praise a joke for being well timed, the close-ups are timed right when a key phrase is said invoking a small but important reaction. Perhaps using close-ups like this is sort of a shortcut in writing, but when you have so many characters to juggle with so little time it\u2019s a very helpful way to keep the audience engaged with the cast. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast themselves are a fairly standard JRPG party with Theo Cornaro as their leader. Theo is your typical nice guy protagonist, except he actually uses the power he gains to make the world better throughout the show. He\u2019s sort of misguided at first; one of his best lines representing this being \u201cWhy can\u2019t we get rid of taxes?\u201d and as usual Silica gently implies that he\u2019s kind of an idiot in the same way a kindhearted little kid is. Even without having the most complex personality, he proves consistently that he is a compassionate person by always putting others ahead of him. Regardless of how high his status rises throughout the series, he doesn\u2019t let himself forget even his foot soldiers. \\n\\n\r\nFrankly, Theo\u2019s simplicity isn\u2019t an obstacle for enjoying the show because he doesn't dominate center stage, he shares it with his partner and eventual love interest Silica, who is a considerably more compelling character. Thankfully Silica is given plenty of agency in the story, she strategizes Theo\u2019s wars with and sometimes for him while he riles up his army with niceness. I hate seeing the love interest character shuffled off into the corner with no pull in the narrative, so Silica\u2019s defiance and individuality are quite refreshing. Their burgeoning romance throughout the series feels incredibly organic, they don\u2019t fall in love because Theo is the guy with the power but out of mutual respect for one another and passion for the same goal. He wants to unite the crests so they can be used to protect everyone and she expresses disdain for the lord's misuse of the crests; they\u2019re a dynamic duo and they have genuine chemistry together in and out of the battles. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the battles, so many battles. I wasn\u2019t prepared for exactly how much fighting would be in Grancrest Senki, but I suppose it does live up to its English title Record of Grancrest War. The battles are how the series progresses its story, similar to the JRPGs that inspired it. If you want an ally, fight them and prove you\u2019re worthy. If you have a disagreement, fight them and prove who\u2019s right. Thankfully, the action is passionately animated. Action scenes are dynamically directed with many different fighting styles used, with different animators hired throughout the series to keep this approach to telling the story refreshing. Even the guy who animated the breathtaking sakuga in Fate/Apocrypha returned to do a few episodes here, and dare I say they fit Grancrest even better thanks to its strong emotional core. There were, however, a few times where the visuals weren\u2019t up to snuff and it was clear they were saving the budget for a grand climax. Other than those low points, it\u2019s visually quite solid.\\n\\n\r\nThe various art styles and animation techniques used to great effect make Grancrest Senki feel more experimental rather than the standard look you\u2019d expect from A-1 pictures. Director Shinichi Omata reminds us of his penchant for well realized dramatic moments with great editing on and off the battlefield. Notably, some of the storyboards used for one of the show's cruelest antagonists Milza are suitably moody with alienating points of view constantly hiding him in shadows. Another great way the villain is portrayed is through the striking thicker lines and his character design being engulfed in darkness aside from his eye and weapon, perfectly conveying the intimidation meant to be felt by the heroes. The visuals superbly define the tone at many points throughout the show; whether it be sweeping establishing shots of lush castles, the dark abstract style to show the presence of chaos, and especially the hopeful horizons illuminated by the setting sun to convey levity after a war. Also, the use of its thrilling orchestral pieces and occasionally uplifting ones do wonders for ensuring emotional beats are on point. \\n\\n\r\nThe most impactful part of the story comes at the very end with the most satisfying and rewarding finale the series could have possibly had. Resolving the conflict in a way that beautifully reincorporates the uplifting themes and previously unresolved character arcs. Although the plot's direction is predictable to anyone who has played a JRPG of its type, what matters is the execution. This isn't some kind of mystery story, although there are plenty of twists and even a couple of shocking betrayals sprinkled in, the story's main success lies in how it's stellar story-telling. I can't say more without spoiling it, but just know that the ending truly feels like a reward for completing the series.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 7/10]\\n\r\nGrancrest Senki\u2019s standard tale of underdogs rising to power is so engaging because of great visual storytelling. If you\u2019re looking for a combat-oriented action-adventure, with plenty of in-depth strategizing, and a romance featuring two compelling leads, then chances are you\u2019ll find this series as enthralling as I did.",

            "content": "***Caution: This review contains spoilers (the specific spoiler discussions will be clearly marked for you to see) so if you can't predict a cliched anime\u2019s cliches, skip the spoiler sections I've marked. Also, do not read this review if you are a Grancrest diehard because it'll probably trigger you, unless if you're objective. If you're neither of these parties, read on with a free mind!***\r\nGrancrest was the first seasonal I picked up in 2018 (not saying much since it released in Jan 6 anyway) and unfortunately my 2018 mean fell right off the bat. Grancrest stumbled out of the gate and fell flat on itsface for the first few episodes and took a long time to get it's footing right. There are different places where I found the show good or bad, which is why I don't consider this show absolutely trash (surprise surprise, not FranXX anyway). So it's first episode started off very conveniently in such that Theo appears out of nowhere, beats the Lord after coming out of nowhere, and picks a somewhat scantily clad girl after as mentioned (not unlike most other isekai or fantasy anime, but I'm not complaining, nothing wrong with fanservice I say :P), coming out of nowhere. Sounds like a rant so I'll tone down for the next bit. \\n\\n\r\nThe show tried introducing it's characters little by little, introducing us to examples like Lassic, Milza among others for the early episodes and introduced others later down the line too. It's always good to see that not all the cast is revealed in its first episode, but unfortunately that didn't help much because we had to make room for our Oh-so-great green haired MC, Theo. Many praised his \u201cbadassery\u201d and his \u201cforward-thinking\u201d and him \u201cnot being dense and weak\u201d and I was terribly confused since none felt true except for his dense part which was randomly and conveniently revealed in a later episode. That is the problem with the show, it's that it's too convenient. \u201cOh Theo is gonna die\u201d but something convenient happens and he's saved. \u201cOh this is gonna happen\u201d but then to benefit Theo\u2019s side it doesn't and the opposite direction is taken. I mean, the show makes Theo out to be like he's the coming of the Messiah or something. He comes, conquers VERY easily, is kind to people (more on that in a bit) and has people serve him in droves. I know it sounds like a rant but to be objective there's nothing wrong with having a righteous MC. It's just that in its current premise I doubt that's what's needed or what makes the most sense. What do I mean? The show is trying to prove that war is dark and to win a war there are sacrifices to be made but Theo goes Yang Wen-Li and wins the war without any well thought out tactics? No thank you. This isn't how you do a war show and definitely not how you make a badass MC. I mean, speaking of Yang, that show excellently shows why war is dark.\\n\\n\r\nWhere there is war there is loss on both sides and this MC is the complete opposite of that. Is there anything wrong with never losing? I don't think so, I mean, a guy like Yang Wen-Li has lost at least once and Theo never did? Don't joke with me A-1. If you're making your MC win as well, MAKE IT BELIEVABLE. Speaking of believable we've got the laughable \u201cbattle tactics\u201d. Once again, it's a show about war so it should have a proper description of what battle tactics are right? WRONG. There is absolutely no mention or any sense in the \u201cbattle tactics\u201d involved and it's just \u201cCharge and win\u201d which I doubt is something that works even 10% of the time, especially when you're constantly outnumbered. A simple \u201cWe'll attack from here and there to trap them\u201d isn't how a battle tactic works. Sense? No, definitely not. Oh and speaking of no sense, we go back to our MC, Theo. To be fair, he did have a decent backstory, I definitely have to give credit where it's due and Theo\u2019s backstory is one that deserves a clap. Just a clap. Why? It's because it was seldom explored after that one episode and they just threw in a pre-show romantic interest and let's just say \u201ctried to be edgy\u201d by giving her one heck of a bombed send-off. And bombs is not the word here. The battle tactics used there as well were close to zilch I'm sad to say. How can inexperienced commoners beat an advanced army? I sincerely apologise because I do not know. Neither did the show. \\n\\n\r\nThen we move to the so called \u201cromance subplot\u201d. It was pretty obvious that Theo would be paired up with Blondie and unfortunately as I expected it wasn't done well. Why does Japan have a hard on for ruining blonde love interests in subplots? (Once again, there are exceptions, we have seen some good blonde love interests in other anime romance subplots before but not as often as one might expect). And this isn't about hair colour here. She was underused and overblown at the same time. She had around 2-3 important lines to say in each episode that were of value, no scratch that, 2-3 important lines every 2 episodes (severely averaged for ease of comprehensive analysis). Her only use was to satisfy the fanboys who already love Theo the \u201cHero\" and want a romance subplot with all the kisses and vows. What if you like me don't like Theo? Zannen-deshoka, you won't be satisfied at all. \\n\\n\r\nYou might say Siluca herself might be able to stand on her own as a character but unfortunately that's not the case with most of the people in the cast. Why? It's because all the characters are cast as stepping stones for Theo-sama to step on and take this place as the best character and biggest badass in this anime. Result? Let's tone down before I turn this into a rant (\u201cwait, it isn't?\u201d I hear you say :P), disappointing. Convenience and stepping stones was the word here unfortunately. Now that I've spewed enough poison over poison, let's calm our nerves down with the plus points of the anime apart from the sadly less explored Theo backstory, the soundtrack. I'd be lying if I didn't tell you I jammed to the second OP each time it played, oh it was so epic. The music selection was needless to say, fantastic, and that's NOTHING to say of the BGM (that's BackGround Music to those who don't know), it was Grancrest's signature achievement. It sent chills down your spine and made you smile in anticipation of what's to come (spoilers: disappointment) and it pumped you up. The visuals thankfully weren't so bad in the OPs and EDs and on a personal note I loved both the EDs. You obviously may not see eye to eye with me but I loved both of them equally and served as an antidepressant for the earlier events of the episode. \\n\\n\r\nNow back to the negatives because I'm out of positives to give, that one scene with Milza and Theo. Since this is a major spoiler so skip approximately 3 lines if you don't want to know about this predictable fight. \\n\\n\r\n***Spoiler begin: The thing is that Milza had given mercy to Theo when Theo didn't ask for it and was about to be killed in the first duel, but in the second and apparently more important one, Theo kills Milza. Nani? Why? What? How? Exactly. I thought they wanted to make Theo look like the next Messiah, what happened here? Well, one could say they wanted to make Theo look badass? I don't even know anymore, needless to say, it was in all literal and figurative sense, a bloody mess. Spoiler end*** \\n\\n\r\nMoving back to the stepping stones, the characters. We go with another spoiler section (will not start immediately so hold on), Alexis and Marrine\u2019s \u201cRomeo and Juliet romance\u201d. Pardon me while I vomit. Okay, let's continue, in terms of anime if you've seen my dropped list I've had the Romeo x Juliet anime at a 2/10 so if you like the story of it in anime form, I don't think you'll hate it so much, unless, if you treat Grancrest like it's equivalent. Romeo and Juliet, the Shakespeare play didn't focus on war as much as the romance, because surprise surprise, it's a romance first and foremost, and another important part is that there's tragedy involved. Does Grancrest follow any of these? No. Why is Marrine and Alexis\u2019 romance related to Romeo and Juliet? Blame the fans, but that's not the issue here. It's that this type of romance won't work in a war show. \\n\\n\r\nI've said this many times in different situations above, Grancrest does a lot of non-war things in a war show and it ruins many of the existing things relative to war shows as well. Going back to the Romeo and Juliet part, some say the Great Hall Tragedy shown in the first scene of the anime counts as tragedy but to that I say \u201cread the original play\u201d. In a later episode, in the final arc, the \u201cfinal battle\u201d which was hyped since the first few episodes that too, went with a POOF. And by POOF I don't mean a bomb. I mean \u201cThe anatomical juxtaposition of two orbicularis oris muscles in a state of contraction.\" As described by Henry Gibbons. In other words, a kiss. Nani? What? Why? When? What happened to the deaths and sacrifices of all those who fought leading up to this event? Why did they hype this battle if this was how it would end? What sort of timing is this??? Marriage? Kiss? Love? Unity? Nothing wrong with all these, but the question remains. If you HAD to follow it this way, then what was the meaning of those previous 20 episodes? Were they to waste? Did they serve as bait? Couldn't this series start off at like episode 16 or 18 and be an OVA? So many questions, and little to no answers. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so, jumping back to the \u201cIt's a war\u201d excuse, in a war you have major character deaths right? Where did the major characters die? Apart from a few minor characters who were obviously forgotten after the next 2 episodes when did we see the death of a main character? Once again, to be fair and objective, there is absolutely nothing wrong with not having major deaths in an anime, I agree, but if you are indeed trying to show that Theo\u2019s side was weak, then why didn't you have important deaths? Yes, the deaths in the first half did exist and they definitely served their purpose, so that's a plus point, but we didn't see anything after that\u2026 Now, a rebuttal to what people might point fingers at my review at, I'll definitely hear the likes of \u201cAlmost all your points against the show are targeting the war aspect of it. You don't know how war shows go. This show isn't about war, it's about blablabla\u201d. Except for that last one which will definitely be used by those who don't even know what the anime is about (please, do not misunderstand, most of you aren't a part of this trope so do not worry), This show is all about war, it's called Grancrest Senki. So it's about war. \\n\\n\r\nAnother example of a \u201cwar show\u201d would be Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, which according to MAL in English is \u201cThe Asterisk War\u201d. My point? Even though their names include the word war (or at least their English counterparts) none of them actually do follow the principles of a war show, less so in Grancrest, since it's whole premise was based on it and that immediately puts it just above Asterisk. So even though Grancrest is about war it rarely sticks to the proper formula of it and no, don't tell me it's a deconstruction, I'll kill you. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, we move on to the last issue of the show which I'll cover, the show\u2019s artstyle. Made by A-1, I expected the show to do okay but it couldn't do that either. Character models looked weak, CGI was used in many scenes (not all), the choreography of the fight scenes themselves were so bad I cringed under my bones and to top it all off, I couldn't find it good at all even at 1080p (yes, I upscaled to 1080p episodes mid-season and still suffered with the artstyle). To go into a little more detail, the character models weren't that eye catchy and to cover for this factor they tried deploying fanservice into the war show to try and make things look attractive (oh fun fact: ever heard of showing your nude body to your army to bolster their morale? Me neither) and I'm not complaining about fanservice (since I love it when used properly) but that it's used in the wrong place and at the wrong time. Perhaps the only \u201cfanservice\u201d that was used at the right time was Siluca\u2019s outfit, which was\u2026 attractive :P\\n\\n\r\nApart from that the fanservice used in the show wasn't done well and A-1 after that episode stopped deploying it and went back to CGI war sequences. Once again to make it clear. I don't have any problem with fanservice, I enjoy Ecchi, it's just that they should be done at the right time, many would say that there's no such specific time for fanservice but I\u2019d say otherwise. If it's not an Ecchi show, don't do random fanservice please thank you. Moving back to the main artstyle, it in simple words wasn't done well for the reasons explained above. \\n\\n\r\n***Spoiler begin: One of the most pathetic and biggest cop outs in the anime was how quickly they changed the villain from Marrine to the Mage Academy. It felt like a ridiculous cop out since the previous episode already ended the whole conflict of the past 20 episodes with a single \u201cI still love you\u201d (oh if only life and war was this easy) and as such this obviously leaves a hugely negative taste in the viewer\u2019s mouth. But wait! There were still 4 more episodes! How ever could they fill them? By adding another villain and acting like \u201cthey were the villain all along\u201d sort of crap. So, the whole 20 episodes of what you watched was for nothing bc Marrine suddenly became good and the last 4 episodes are important because the Mage Academy were the villains all along? They never showed up in the show before though? No mention of them was made and nothing was talked about. Yet they suddenly and extremely conveniently make their appearance to quickly put an end to the cries of \u201cWhat was the point of the past 20 eps???\u201d and from what I can see, that failed spectacularly. They continued with this bullish nature till the end\u2026 Spoiler end***\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone wondering about it's ending, Grancrest\u2019s ending does bring closure. Although on the cliched Shoujo side. It had it's purpose to play. The first half of the episode was as disappointing as you'd expect from the show. But the second half tried to mend those to little avail. Yeah it was cute I could say but such an ending is the same as what happened with the Marrine vs Alexis war\u2026 Not something I'd call amazing but eh, it served it's purpose I guess\u2026 I guess they wanted to follow the fairytale? Either way, Grancrest left me unimpressed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so with a heavy heart I must conclude that Grancrest isn't at all what I'd like to call a \u201cgood\u201d show this year. It's plot was excrutiatingly convenient, the characters were made such that they were stepping stones for Theo, Marrine and Alexis\u2019 romance was horribly handled and had a ridiculously lame \u201cresolution\u201d later on, the Artstyle wasn't what I expected, the battle tactics weren't at all present, the \u201cfinal battle\u201d was a laughable cop out, etc. the show had one or two positive points to it namely the soundtrack that was brilliantly done and Theo\u2019s backstory was somewhat decent. This is all I can say to end on a positive note on this semi-rant and semi-review hybrid, not unlike my Dakara boku wa H ga dekinai review which was done in my old format back when the year started. If you made it till here, thank you for taking the time to read this review and if you do decide to watch Grancrest, please don't expect too much of it because the end result is far lower than that. Most of what you expect from Grancrest can be found elsewhere in shows that are actually good anyway right?\\n\\n\r\nP.S: ***MAJOR SPOILER: Another show where the Hero restores peace to the land eh\u2026 how tiring and cliched.

            "content": "Fantasy-genre shows, often times, have the dilemma of getting too caught up in their own facade, resulting in an omission of the basic rules of adequate storytelling (i.e. developing realistic characters and a coherent plot).  Grancrest Senki not only fails on the latter account, it also doesn\u2019t concentrate enough effort on the fantasy itself, instead opting for, rushed, battle scenes with insufficient background knowledge to know why certain events are taking place.  Needless to say, the viewer is left in a state of confusion, wondering why events seem disjointed from one another, and what the purpose of the show is as a whole.Despite these glaring oversights, the show attempts to display a sense of grandeur with its use of magical spells and crest powers; however, it feels rudimentary in its approach, failing to distinguish itself from the crowd of analogous shows that came before its time.  \\n\\n\r\nIt is, in a word: commonplace.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, I would venture to guess that the show\u2019s staff spent more of its time discussing what color a character\u2019s hair, or eyes, should be, rather than determining an interesting way of presenting a strong narrative.  Sure, there are numerous, unforeseen plot twists that produce genuine shock, but they don\u2019t meld well with the ongoing story.  They are, in essence, empty events, lacking necessary substance for the viewer to latch onto, and become empathetic to what is happening on the screen.  To crystallize these claims, look no further than episode nine, a major turning point in the series.  In a scene that is oddly reminiscent of episode eleven in Berserk (the 1997 series), Theo and Siluca take shelter in the base of a tree from precipitous rainfall.  Siluca, unable to control her emotions, confronts Theo about his thoughts towards her, as he admits that he loves her.  Besides being overly-romanticized, their infatuation for one another lacks the appropriate depth to feel authentic.  These two hardly know each other, except for the fact that Theo is a \u201cprodigious\u201d wanderer, and Siluca is a mage who get\u2019s infuriated when other\u2019s stare at her scantily clad outfit \u2014 for god\u2019s sake, just wear something else you whiny tramp.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, that brings me to the next whore, Marrine Kreische.  Being the \u201cclairvoyant\u201d that she is, Marrine decides that she cannot win the war without Mirza (the perpetually angry dude); thus, she passively offers herself to him in a scene that can only be described as inane.  I mean, let\u2019s be honest, she just conquered the entire nation of Starck with little-to-no effort, because of the use of miasma.  Why, then, is it essential for her to have Mirza to the point of having intercourse with him?  Besides being proficient with his sword (hehe), he doesn\u2019t offer much in terms of strategic planning or anything else that requires a modicum of actual thought.  Therefore, her decision to do the nasty with him doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense.  It\u2019s not the content of the scene that I\u2019m enamored with \u2014 as far too many fanboy\u2019s are \u2014 it\u2019s the execution, and the lack of build up to her eventual fall from grace.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, for lack of a better term, is nonsensical, and with each resultant plot twist, the damage becomes significantly worse.  Instead of concocting logical battle plans or implementing the use of military tactics, we see an angry Mirza slashing his sword through countless enemies, as his troops, apparently, watch him as he does so.  Swords glow, blood spills, magic happens, and new characters/countries are introduced with each passing episode; but, ultimately, it\u2019s all window dressing to conceal the vacuous character\u2019s that plague the viewer\u2019s enjoyment.  Investing two minutes of each episode, to chronicle pivotal attributes of each pertinent character would have been time well spent; instead of resorting to cheap fan-service ploys (a-la Queen Eudokia when she \u201cinspired\u201d her troops).\\n\\n\r\nThe omission of narrative flow is evident from the outset, as episodes leap from one critical moment to the next, without ample explanation to bridge the narrative gap.  Simply put: it is a gallimaufry of perplexing events.  The crux of this issue lies with the desire to construct an expansive story with a myriad of nations.  Nothing wrong with striving for breadth in an anime series, but when character\u2019s are glossed over, and battles just seem to a happen \u2014 as if, from thin air \u2014 it becomes frustrating to solve the puzzle that the anime staff was too indolent to solve themselves.  Furthermore, there is no historical context as to why the Factory Alliance and the Fantasia Union are at odds with one another in the first place (let alone the intrusive involvement of the Mage Academy).  We are given a generic explanation that the various Lords want to collect the crests to increase their influence and power.  But, even then, where did the crests come from, and why do they possess such miraculous powers?  Can anyone become a mage, or only certain people?  Why didn\u2019t we hear about the divine beasts until episode 20, and did they rip that concept off from Zelda: Breath of the Wild \u2014 certainly seems like it! \\n\\n\r\nThough, with \u201cinspirational\u201d lines like this, \u201cIt\u2019ll all work out somehow,\u201d from Theo Cornaro, the show\u2019s main protagonist.  It\u2019s not terribly surprising the show left numerous questions unanswered.  In the end, it aimed for everything (mostly through appropriation), yet it was all for naught, as it became the medieval equivalent of an Expendables movie.\\n",

            "content": "War isn\u2019t so bad but it\u2019s what and how it leads to it. It seems in fantasy war stories these days, we rarely encounter a story that isn\u2019t saturated with the most generic tropes possible. Romance, tragedy, revenge, politics. You name it. It\u2019s there. What does that say for a show like Grancrest Senki (Record of the Grancrest War) though? \r\nTo be fair, I\u2019ve never read the original light novels before. It\u2019s written by a guy named Ryo Mizuno who created the Record of Lodoss War series. Even as an anime original viewer, it felt like a series that was easy to jump into. Thepremise isn\u2019t overly complicated as we learn about how war broke loose in the world of Grancrest Senki. Humanity uses Crests that are capable of utilizing magic to deal with supernatural threats such as demons. The most powerful crests are known as Grancrest. Unfortunately, humans are flawed and war broke loose as people seek to gain the most powerful crests themselves. The series chronicles the story of Siluca Meletes and Theo Corano as the two hopes to end the conflict between humanity themselves and defeat the demons. \\n\\n\r\nOk. It's not complicated but as an anime viewer, I\u2019m baffled by the storytelling pacing of the show from the very start. It\u2019s lightning fast that by the time I finished the fourth or fifth episode, it felt like the series jumped way over itself. It would be fair game if the show focused on the story with concrete development but instead, we are introduced with many characters early from the start. Besides Siluca and Theo, the show contains lots of characters of nobility. Aristocrats are a common sight and stands at the high tier of society. On the other hand, there are also characters that dedicates themselves to their own devoted duties such as Aishela, Irvin, and Margaret, and Marrine. Unfortunately, most of these characters have flaws like the way humans do. Some of their decisions in the show are very controversial. Marrine is a prime example in one of the later episodes as she makes a choice that will rub people in the wrong way. \\n\\n\r\nI have attempted to forgive the characters\u2019 choices making as it\u2019s not easy for a show like this to make adequate ones. In other words, how should we judge the characters? Let\u2019s talk about our main protagonists, Siluca and Theo. These two come from different backgrounds but are perhaps the least corrupted individuals in their world. Siluca may be an inexperienced mage but she has a heart of gold. While not as skilled as some others, Siluca is a character with a clever mind although can be forceful at times to get her point across. It didn\u2019t surprise to me that she would sometimes take risks to accomplish her goals. On the other hand, Theo is a man who is perhaps one of the most calm characters in the show. Always keeping his cool and in control of his emotions, it feels like the show designates him as an eventual leader. He also has human morals that are often shown through his actions and words. Often choosing a path with the least violence, Theo does engage in fighting if he feels absolutely necessary. While you could say that these two are perfectly suited for the show, they do make mistakes as well. It\u2019s also inevitable that romance would eventually develop between the two as many hints are dropped in throughout the show. However, unlike most couple pairings, it seems these two really are destined to be together with their similar ideals. This is in contrast with some character pairings such as Marrine/Alexis or Villar/Margaret where fate somehow interferes with their love. Still, the show tries its best to maintain a balanced war story. Romance is actually subtle even with some of the background storytelling such as the one between Marrine and Alexis. In a show like this, I have to admit that throwing in many tropes at once doesn\u2019t help it flow better. It\u2019s like an amalgamation of fictional elements all coming together that may leave viewers feel distracted. The political affairs in the show also feels forced on many occasions despite being necessary for the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nWith 24 episodes, the show\u2019s pacing somehow still takes a stab in the heart. Some episodes are abruptly resolved while others loves to play around with its tropes. The storytelling itself is also predictable with some events that are inevitable to happen. As I mentioned before, there are too many characters that some are just left in the dust and others hardly developed. Aishela is a crime of this as we barely finds out anything about her at all until near the end of the show. By then, I wonder if viewers even cares. Others such as Priscilla and Mirza suffers from characterization as there are hardly any memorable qualities about them. It feels like the author decided to thrown in all sort of characters in at once to make the show feel credible. This even extends to characters with supernatural origins such as werewolves and vampires. Well, I suppose the creators wanted to take that risk but to me, it wasn\u2019t rewarding in the end. With so many characters, Grancrest Senki felt like a play with an overstacked roster where not everyone got their chance to shine.\\n\\n\r\nTo the surprise of no one, A-1 Pictures adapts the show as many of the series have a similar style when it comes to fantasy series. Because this show also involves war and magic, you\u2019ll definitely get a familiarity of what they present each episode. First of all, I would like to say that the animation quality does look sharp especially in early episodes. The action choreography looks smooth and characters are decorated with enough details suitable for this show. However, the character designs themselves leaves little to be desired. Siluca\u2019s ridiculous outfit is a prime example of being distracting to the point that she herself is aware of it. Others such as Marrine and Alexis looks incredibly one dimensional that fits with the nobility stereotype. Oh and of course, fan service exists. There\u2019s skinship in some episodes that leaves little to the imagination while action is shown in brutal uncensored details. To say the least, A-1 did its job but not one that I can confess as impressive overall. The production quality does drop over time in typical A-1 fashion as time passes.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to a few other fantasy war stories I\u2019ve watched, I\u2019d say that Grancrest Senki has a moderate soundtrack. It didn\u2019t set the bar high though as it still sounds very generic even during climatic battle scenes. The theme songs contains the sort of J-Pop style lyrics you probably hear often these days. Character voice mannerisms are moderate at best although I have to admit that certain cast members really sounds motivated. Even Siluca has her own moments that are sometimes worth quoting despite her personality.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Grancrest Senki reminds me of playing a video game where the developer wants you to love what the designed. Truth to be told, I think the show is average at best. It reached its high points in the show on some episodes while making an ill early impression. Quite frankly, there are way too many characters that by the time the show is over, I can only recall a few names. The pacing feel sloppy and really could have improved on many levels. Watch it if you want but be prepare for being underwhelmed.",

            "content": "I have one word for the creators of this show: PACING!\r\nI don't think I've ever seen a show that had so little grasp of how pacing should be done in a form of entertainment.  One episode we're watching a full war scene where every detail is being focused on with flashy fights, decent choreography, and plenty of magic.  The very next will have any battles just skimmed over as \"yeah some people died, here's a 5 second clip of people dying.\"  One episode will go deep into the politics and bonds present in the show, then it switches to either skimming overimportant things or it changes back over to thinking it's an action show.  Pick a speed, and pick a theme to tell your story, don't just mash everything you've got into a pile and call it a tale.  \\n\\n\r\nStory aside, most of the characters are as unbelievable as they can possibly be.  The MC Siluca has the loyalty of a squirrel that's found someone with a nut it wants (other MC: Theo).  Here we have an extremely talented mage who is already setup for fame and fortune throwing it all away to dedicate their entire life to a random stranger they found on the side of the road...what?  Theo is a complete mess of a character as, again, the authors can't seem to decide what he is. Is he naive, is he smart, is he dumb, is he aiming for the top, or is he simply looking to accomplish his goals? You can't make a good character by answering YES to all of the above!\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all of this the story suffers from several elements being shoehorned in for no reason at all.  Why does Siluca wear revealing clothing? Because she was wearing them at the start of the show and is apparently incapable of ever changing them, despite constantly complaining about them and how everyone else leers at her.  Why did we need a sex scene between two people that have never even met before? Yeah, remember the pacing issue?  Five seconds of people dying in a horrible battle for territory, but here's a full timeslot dedicated to watching the two opposing rulers banging each other under the moon simply because he asked.  No reason, nothing added to the story, guy just walks up and says \"I know we're enemies but I want to have sex with you.\" Who wrote any of this and thought it made a single degree of sense?!\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a complete and utter mess, which is a shame as the art is actually pretty good.  The crests and clothing are colorful and really add to the atmosphere of the setting.  Too bad it's only dolling up nonsensical characters and awkward scenes.  The only reason I'm still watching this at all is out of sheer curiosity of where this trainwreck is going to finally stop. \\n\\n\r\n(Written on episode 9)",

The way it is portrayed is not what you would regularly see in animes, infact - it was refreshing. Overall, the only downside was the pacing of the actual story, which had been going all over the place (But it is well within acceptable bounds, you can clearly understand what is going on, and that is what matters most).\\n\\n\r\n-Art (10/10) - Outstanding\\n\r\nI don't need to put many words here, the style and the shading were superb and I do wish to see more shows like this. Overall, it fits well with the story theme and was very pleasant.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound (9/10) - Great\\n\r\nI'm not an expert, but the sounds were Great! not something I will remember by the end of the next year, but they fit the setting pretty well in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment (9/10) - Great\\n\r\nThere was a certain scene that was controversial and caused a lot of spite in the anime community that took up the show,  but for me, that certain scene gave all the more enjoyment to the story in general and opened many more questions for me. It is an emotional ride, and I do believe that a show SHOULD have that sort of impact on you, be it a sad moment or something you feel outraged at; Grancrest Senki definitively had its fair share of squeezing our hearts (for better or worse).\\n\\n\r\n-Overall (9/10) - Personally anywhere between 8.7-9.2\\n\\n\r\nFinally, to address the issue of butthurt viewers. Halfway through the show, there is a certain scene that defines true fans of anime from people that are simply ignorant. That scene will define if you have any respect towards the author and the anime studio that made the anime possible. If you give a bad review solely because of that one scene, then congratulations - you have no respect for someone's hard work and time.\\n\\n\r\nThank you very much for reading my review and I do hope it has touched some (or any) that come across it to pick up the show.",

Ina nutshell, they are basically the anime equivalent of Electronic Arts where they love to pander to the lowest common denominator with the buggy releases, forced micro-transactions, and overall shallow games.\\n\\n\r\nRecord of the Grancrest war along with Darling in the Franxx which is mainly a A1 show mind you are the latest A1 shows to come out from A1\u2019s dog collars to deliver us two seasonal anime train-wrecks in order to once again please the lowest common dominator of anime with the atrocious writing, bland tropey characters, subpar art and preachy themes.\\n\\n\r\nLike with most A1 productions I kept my expectations very low because honestly the moment I praise a show from A1 the show would go back to its awful roots by having a stupid plot twist that completely goes against the narrative that has been previously been set up in previous episodes to having creepy and horrible sex scenes\u2026 Needless to say, I and my good friend decided to marathon this train-wreck of a show and by the end of it, we were shocked of how bad it was to a point where I actually one of A1 worst shows. Now with that, all said Hello everyone this is Shawn aka PhantomKurata and welcome to my review of Record of the Grancrest war and with that said let\u2019s dive into this train-wreck shall we.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nAtlatan, a land ruled by\u00a0Chaos. Fearing disaster brought about by chaos, the people lived protected by \u201cLords;\u201d those with the power of \u201cCrests,\u201d used to suppress the chaos. However, the Lords decided to abandon the concept of protecting the people and turn against each other, stealing each other\u2019s Crests to gain dominion over one another. The story follows Siluca a young mage who scorns the feuding lords for abandoning their people. One day she meets a wandering swordsman and Crest holder Theo\u00a0who is trying to liberate his hometown from its tyrant lord. Seeking for an opportunity Siluca helps Theo raise his rank to a knight as well forming a contract with him. Joining forces, Siluca, Theo and their allies fight together to end the war between the different noble factions, and put an end to the threat of Chaos.\\n\\n\r\nLike with most A1 productions they all have great concept and ideas on paper, however, A1 Pictures has the really nasty habit of taking things that have great potential and decides to screw it all up in actual execution and Record of Grancrest War no different.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in Record of Grancrest War is only interesting if you have never seen any action fantasy anime in your life because it\u2019s one of the most generic run of the mill fantasy story that there is. A character starts off as a nobody but as soon as he gets invited to set army and trains for a while he became one of the strongest characters from the army. All of the fantasy cliches are present here.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing is poor at best as it features a lot of questionable acts that go happened within the show, for example, the end of episode 9 where the alliance Marrine wanted to meet with Lord Milza so they can perform a ritual together by having sex in the open of a countryside. What the hell were you thinking A1 Pictures? It\u2019s bad enough that they have sex in the open where at anytime they can get shot down by arrows by any faction but the way Marrine was acting during that sex act was incredibly disturbing and made me feel uncomfortable. I don\u2019t sex scenes in anime but they A1 Pictures does them is creepy and forced. I hope to god that A1 Pictures will never animate a sex scene ever again because these incompetent bastards don\u2019t know the meaning of sex.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me started with this shows directing because I have never seen a war fantasy show that skips fights/battles and a great example of this was in episode 17 where the Kilhis army focus was planning to attack the Dartanian \u00a0army and instead of showing the whole battle as soon the leader puts on the golden mask on the show fades out and the next shot\u00a0 we see that the Killhis forces were defeated and to add insult to entry the leader info-dumps all the events that happened in the battle instead of showing us the battle\u2026 WHY JUST WHY. I understand the show wanted to establish of how powerful the Dartanian army is but this was the cheapest way to do it. It\u2019s like they clearly ran out of budget just for that scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing from this show that single-handily killed the show was the pacing. The pacing in Record of Grancrest war is way too fast for its own good. It\u2019 was okay in the beginning but it really became a big problem as the series goes on and because of the shows fast pacing almost all of the things that go on in the show feels incredibly rushed. The perfect example of this show awful pacing is with Theo character progression. In the beginning of the series, the show establishes that he is a sloppy fighter who cannot defend himself but in a couple of episodes later he suddenly becomes an expert fighter as well a ruler of his own lead who is very capable of taking over mutable lands. The sad part is thanks to the shows fast pacing we barely got to see any character development and growth from Theo at all.\u00a0 This was single-handily Record of the Grancrest war biggest mistake and because of that the show became an insufferable train-wreck most A1 productions\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story for Record of Grancrest Senki is just awful.\\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nLike with the story the characters are only interesting if you never seen a fantasy anime before because they are all just generic fantasy characters that we all seen before.\u00a0 Am not trying that having generic characters in a fictional work is bad because generic characters can actually be likable and charming if done right. The problems is apart from Siluca all of the characters in Record of the Grancrest war are all generic and one dimensional who have no charm at all.\\n\\n\r\nTheo is your typical fantasy lead that we all seen before other fantasy animes in the past. His character development is nearly non-existent thanks to this show pacing issues and his personality is boring.\\n\\n\r\nSiluca is a pretty decent female lead overall. She\u2019s strong, likable, and just very enjoyable to watch. It\u2019s such a shame that she\u2019s not really the main focus because she could have been a great character if Theo didn\u2019t exist. Now if I think about it Theo existence completely hold this character back from being great as she kinda devolves as a character as the series goes along where she just wants to lick on Theo\u2019s dick. Such a shame really because she could have been a great character.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters in Record of Garncrest War are just your generic fantasy characters that we all seen before and they are not even worth mentioning due to how one note all of them are including the villains.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters in Record of Garncrest War were really bad and forgetful.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the visuals of Record of Garncrest war I thought the visuals were pretty alright for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters designs are pretty decent overall especially for the females who have the best designs in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe fan-service in this anime is pretty tolerable for the most, however, the anime at times can get carried away with the fan-service but least it not as bad as\u00a0The Asterisk\u00a0Wars and Eromanga Sensei.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that I didn\u2019t like about the art is how inconstant it is from character going off model in various scenes in the show to awkwardly use of CGI in many scenes in the show. The animation is passable for the most part however it had its fair share of still frames in many areas as well as some awkward shots.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the visuals of Record of the Garncrest war is decent for the most part.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nLike with most A1 Productions the soundtrack is easily the best part about these shows and Record of the Garncrest war is no different.\\n\\n\r\nBoth opening and ending themes of the show were pretty good overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty good for the type of show that it is and I have no complaints whatsoever. \\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nRecord of the Grancrest War is one of the worst directed show I have ever seen from this genre.\\n\\n\r\nIt was very boring to watch and it made me wish I was watching other fantasy names. The story is shallow and poorly written. The directing and pacing was beyond trash, most of the characters were sucked and the animation was subpar. The only decent things about this show were the visuals and music.\\n\\n\r\nLike with most A1 Productions it should be thrown in the dumpster where it should be destroyed. If you like Record of Grancrest War and any A1 production than good for you but don\u2019t go out there and say that A1 is a great anime studio because you will only piss off more experienced anime fans such as myself. Don\u2019t get me wrong I like a couple of A-1 shows like Black Butler Book of Circus/Murder, Woatkoi, Magi and Shinsekai Yori but for every A-1 show that I like these always a bunch of A1 shows that I hate like Eromanga Sensei, The Asterisk\u00a0Wars, Fate Apocrypha, Sword Art Online etc.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t recommend this show to anyone unless you want to see how incompetent A-1 Pictures is as a studio for the 20th time.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully, the PS4 game will be better.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 2.5/10",

            "content": "Having only watched 8 episodes of this I have to say that the show feels rushed. It's only 6 or 7 eps in that it finally has enough set up for it to really tell its story. \r\nThe male MC is a typical commoner-with-a-will. Past that and he is quite flat for some time, ep 5 is where he actually starts to make his own plays. \r\nThis show is not a battle show, the rushed first 4 epis are to get the MCs into a political location where they have enough there to have stakes in that arena. That being said, I am finding myselfhaving to pay extremely close attention to every single line of dialogue and every action much closer than I normally would. \\n\\n\r\nNow that the show is into the political end of the spectrum it can drop a lot of the shorthand that it had been using to set everything up. Theo is effective in this in that he is as unaware of the politicalscape as the audience while actually being from the setting (avoiding isekai hell) \\n\\n\r\nOur other MC is trained from a very young age to be politically savvy as well as having potent magical skill. Her own goals align with Theo's but go considerably farther than his did in the beginning, having her be fresh out of school and thus socially unaware of the world, gives us the audience a good glimpse into the society in the setting as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nNow that we are past the ground block world building, we are looking at the political alliances that the MCs have found themselves entwined in. Where the focus has shifted off of our handy short-hand characters to much more rounded nobility who are rife with problems. \\n\\n\r\nKnowing that this series has 24 epis really helps in gauging the final scope. \\n\\n\r\nAs this is a review, I will say that their execution of plot is adequate. You have to really look into what is going on to get it, but the plot is there. It's just not focused on the same thing as most anime are. Battles are not the climax of this plot. They are used to further it, as examples of what the war looks like, as ways to show how each of the Lords acts in combat to their own ideals, ethics, and codes of conduct. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is adequate, not top tier, and not utter shit. I have no opinion on the soundrack or use of music, so it's doing its job. \\n\\n\r\nI am finding myself enjoying this show quite a bit despite its flaws. \\n\\n",

            "content": "tbh. theres nothing special about this series. \r\n-the settings is pretty much similar with the other typical Advanture-Fantasy series. bringing peace to the land or saving/changing the world from a certain condition, advanture party, magic-user,non-human being existance and some \"trademark elements\" in this series its the \"Crest\".\r\n-the plot is proceeding toward the partial cases that will lead to a certain happy ending(theres nothing wrong with the happy ending, the audience/fans/readers etc deserve it).\r\n-you probably could guessed out most of the plot since its not confusing at all instead its pretty much straight but just to alert yourself of some unexpected twist(since we dont know whatreally will happen when blind watched some things) for example:episode 9(not twisted at all but quite fast)\\n\\n\r\ni LIKED this series. cause for me Anime is an Entertainment something to entertain you. was it enjoyable for you or not. and i did enjoy it, it gives me the hype and fun even tho you know that you already watched/readed lots of series that have the similar settings like this while you cant help but NATURALLY feel that you actually enjoyed it. and it became one of my most anticipated weekly episodes in Spring 2018 because i cant wait to see the plot proceed further even tho i didnt read the LN and kind of imagined how it will ended it still give me the Thrills from the plot. you know this would happened you know that would happened and when it happened you didnt feel dissappointed at all instead you enjoyed the ride.\\n\\n\r\n^THIS IS JUST MY OPINION. im a plot-lover i didnt love them just so that i can critics them, i love them for the Thrills on how they play with my heart. it brings me tears, it brings me joy, it sometimes make me feel sad, happy, angry, down, suspensed, frustrated, hyped anything you named it, its bring lots of emotions out of me. and i did enjoyed this series my heart did played along with it.  in the end all that matters is for you to enjoy it. \\n\r\n-if you feel like you cannot enjoyed it you can dropped it.\\n\r\n-if you feel dissappointed in it you can dropped it.\\n\r\n-if you feel angry that its so pathethic you can dropped it.\\n\r\nits fine as long as you didnt enjoyed it. cause good or not if you enjoyed something you will watch it or follow it, you will stop if you stop enjoying it. cause that is the main purpose afterall, that is for us to enjoy the entertainments that were created for us.\\n\\n\r\nSimple Summary:Arts-above average. Characters-typical and too much blondie(no offence), Siluca look really similar with Marrine. but some F.Characters have good appeal thank you for that. Animation-too normal and become weirder during action. Adaptation-badly adapted you could tell from the plot that they skipped so much things from the source. and theres no Siluca back story with Aishela.\\n\\n\r\nITS GOOD IF YOU LIKED IT, ITS ALSO FINE IF YOU DONT LIKED IT EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN PREFERENCE. ANYWAYS THANK YOU MIZUNO RYO FOR THE GRANCREST SENKI SERIES. IT DID GOT PLACE IN MY LIFE, I ENJOYED IT THANK YOU.\\n\\n\r\nStory:7\\n\r\nArt:6\\n\r\nSound:5\\n\r\nCharacter:4\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\nOverall:8",

            "content": "Just another typical anime , add a pretty low score to that and you get grancrest senki But (and this is a big one) it kinda feels like something that is trying to be different yet does it succeed or not ? \r\nFirst let me say that there are some controversial views on this show the reason being what happened halfway through but to be honest they should've added the gore genre to the list so  that people knew what they were getting in to.\r\nThat's right it has some elements of the gore genre , to be precise some lots of it and ifyou are not into that concept you shouldn't be watching it. The +17 sign should be considered as well since it really is kinda +17.\\n\r\nWith those being said I'll move to the anime itself : \\n\r\nWe have the story first probably the weakest part of the anime but not that bad to make the whole thing worthless , it would've actually been a good story if the pacing was controlled and some explanations were given along plots but with the current plot holes you shouldn't expect much of it. If you lower your expectatins it would be an enjoyable show to watch (binge watch).\\n\r\nThen we have the art , since A-1 is behind grancrest senki one would think of an average art at the very least and I must say they have done a pretty good job on the art. Its far from perfect but there are some scenes you want to pause and just look. The sound and background music go really well with the emotions and scenery depicted so that's a plus. The music and opening and ending themes are done really epic and go along really well with the anime.\\n\r\nNext up are the characters , being one of the things I enjoy in the anime there are many different characters and personalities in grancrest senki , yes there are some typical stuff but overall it is really enjoyable seeing this many characters with different feelings which are actually relatable to some extent and help you enjoy the show as it is.",

            "content": "Warning: this series turns into something else entirely at episode 9. Prior to episode 9 I gave this series a solid 6. Nothing great but a fun story that was nice to kill a little time. \r\nEven before episode 9 the anime really fit into one of those awkward spots where it's not bad... but everything is done just a little bit wrong.\r\nFor example the action is good... except since we rush through every battle it's hard to be invested into most of it so it's actually a bit boring except for the occasional badass moment but even that's a bit wasted by the pacing.\r\nThesetting is good ... but a lot of it is just skimmed over and a lot of it isn't getting properly addressed. .\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are good ... but because of how the series chooses to divide it's focus they often do things for poorly explained or no reason. In order to avoid spoilers I'll just say the entire war has a feeling of pointlessness as the path to peace seems relatively easy but the characters able to do so choose not to because ... well the show needed a plot somehow.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of issues with the series come from it's pacing but besides the pacing itself it's presentation and focus are lack luster as well.\\n\\n\r\nBut again even with all this considered it still had a fun tone that kept it a nice watch... then it suddenly turns insanely brutal episode 9 to the point the series isn't even recognizable. Don't mistake this as meaning the show improved either. The pace is still a mess and the presentation and focus are still poor. But while before it was midly forgivable as a light hearted adventure that didn't need a lot of depth now it's a full scale bloody war series that feels hollow.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists are entirely unlikeable as their actions are needlessly brutal and psychotic but seemingly presented in a way that feels like the show wants the audience to sympathize with them.\\n\\n\r\nThis leaves a rather bad taste as many likeable characters die for the sake of a war that didn't even need to happen based off of what the series itself has stated.\\n\\n\r\nI really don't recommend this to anyone as if you like the first 8 episodes you'll start to hate the series 9 onwards and if you are the type that likes 9 onwards it's not worth forcing yourself through the first 8 to get to. There are other anime that do brutal wars better so there is no need to waste time on this.",

            "content": "I have watched almost 200 anime. There were better and worse ones. I have few that are my favourites but when I finished Grancrest Senki yesterday I was super happy that I had a chance to watch this one.\r\nOverall I can say that it was amazing story, full of action, magic, battles, creatures and romance. For me MC and his mage were really nicely done (however Silica should have more screen time)  along with a lot of other characters like Shadow, twin werewolves, valkyrie, vampire lord, black witch and few lords. Draw style was really nice, music was good but not superb.\r\nWhat I alsoliked about this anime was that there were no hentai/echhi elements and instead we had a lot of drama but not so much like in Akame ga kill. Characters are not overpowered (maybe in fight with the cyclop...), they are humans which can easily die.  I was kinda worried about MC and Silica at the end (japanese creators love to kill some MC or make them disappear forever) because I like happy endings. However the ending was really nice (yet final fight with the Artist was kinda boring).\\n\\n\r\nI can recommend this anime to everyone. For me - best anime I have ever watched - 10/10 :)",

            "content": "The art is no doubt good backed by A-1 and nowadays making anime is a lot cheaper and easier than before. This show started off decent, but it was rough and seemed like it could take it somewhere. I read another review about the pacing being too fast or too slow at parts, that comment is totally true. The show starts up and the first 4 episodes go crazy fast. You think the directors and authors are pulling a Samurai Champaloo thing where the main characters are already op (maybe not the best comparison but thats all that came to mind), but it moves fasterthen those crappy magic high school animes that are all the same with slight differences. I did not fully enjoy the show starting it, but it looked interesting and the characters could go somewhere. The romance is very forced and you are made to believe it,(another bad example coming up) its a failed attempt at introducing romance that is slightly believable. I haven't seend Clannand or what every but I have seen My High school Romantic comedy SNAFU (aka Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku) and that romance was as always childish as all slice of life romcoms are, but they got you to believe it. See if you want that love between Theo and Meletes to really show love and the power of love make it believable and develop it. Yes lie is in believe but doesn't mean its gotta be fake. And this is as someone who is not a weeb or otaku and somebody who hates this type of thing,\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \\n\r\nOkay here I want to take a breather and calm myself down before I go all out. This show has a nice main character Theo/Siluca I like Theo, he is not half bad. The show carried itself decently at the begin and it seemed like it was gonna be political, but delve into the characters more. Then the road block of bringing in politics is that you have to introduce all these characters and you want to make it make sense and make characters come off as cool and smart. They have focused alot more on everybody except the main characters, Theo and Siluca so far. The anime still has ability to make itself better and offer less empty space and change its paced to something better. Don't toss this anime right away as you have to understand some of the character creation is average and it seems as this show is being rushed from the studio. Its decent and if more time was put into the characters and the characters it could go from a 3 for characters to a 6 or 7. So if it hasn't scared you away stay tuned,because it almost had me scared. \\n\\n\r\n SPOILER SPOILER GOING TO RUIN A SPOILED SHOW AND WANT YOU TO KILL THE AUTHORS\\n\r\n*\\n\r\n*Spoiler in 4 more stars\\n\r\n*\\n\r\n*\\n\r\n*\\n\r\n*\\n\r\nMARRINE AND MILZA WHY DOES THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN WHAT VALUE DOES IT GIVE.

            "content": "(WARNING: a bit of spoilers up ahead)\r\nSo this is another generic, medieval-like fantasy show with the usual dense male protagonist and everything basically rigged with comedy and awkward RPG-like vibes, as well as the clich\u00e9 transitions of the mc easily making companions throughout the journey. This is the kind of series that usually just starts okay, progresses badly, and ends awful, for the most part.\r\nWell\u2026for the first 6 or 9 episodes, it seemed that way, at least. However, for me at least, it actually turned out to be a lot more than what meets the eye. Granted, this series still had its flaws in termsof the usual gigs with most fantasy / magic anime series. In short, this series is actually good, but it\u2019s understandable why many people would either hate or ignore it, considering the amount of attention that other shows are getting during the seasons of Winter and Spring 2018 in anime.\\n\r\nSTORY: Okay, this is the main bugaboo that this series has, above all other things: PACING. Even as a two-cour series, the pacing feels really off, and the important events in the shows are often rushed and skim on certain details, especially when many of the battles feel like they end too quickly and/or easily. In fairness, this was probably done on purpose due to the fact that this series might not get a second season in the near future, if at all, due to undisclosed reasons that only the directors would know.\\n\r\nThere is the nice perk with this series, though. Instead of feeling like a very clich\u00e9 and boring story where the typical dense protagonist goes through the story with not much significant adversity or hardship, this show took quite an interesting turn, for better or worse, depending on the subjectivity of the viewers. After what felt like an easy \u201cwalk in the park\u201d for the main hero, the whole situation literally turned into a Game of Thrones, where all the kingdoms tried to assert dominance over the other, instead of focusing on the true villainous group pulling the strings. In many cases, the very good and the very bad were brought out in many of the characters involved in the conflicts\u2026.so much for smooth sailing for the mc. There were also painful sacrifices and exposures to reality that I really thought made the plot more compelling than other people may think. Another thing I like to point out is that the show doesn\u2019t really have much comic relief, if at all; to me, this is actually a good thing because the comedy would feel very out of place considering the story\u2019s progression.\\n\r\nGranted, the story still ran into issues during the second half, as it still felt too easily wrapped up, especially in how they switched up antagonists down the stretch. I cannot say for sure if the possibility of a second season may do the story enough justice, but personally, I do give credit that the series did have an actual conclusion instead of being open-ended. Needless to say, though, as aforementioned, the pacing of the story could\u2019ve been handled a lot better.\\n\r\nANIMATION: Love or hate A-1 Pictures all you like, but regardless, these guys really know how to put together some hella fine animation. While the animation is not quite so smooth in terms of movement, it is not entirely awkward and doesn\u2019t try to do stuff like adding bad CGI scenes in. I do want to point out something that may or may not be offputting to some people. During some battle scenes, particularly the battle against the Cyclops, the animation may look very sloppy to many viewers. However, I personally think, though can\u2019t confirm, that A-1 pictures is probably trying to animate those scenes in a somewhat similar style that studio Trigger would utilize. When scenes like that are animated in that fashion, they\u2019re supposed to keep you glued to the action. Granted, A-1 Pictures may not produce the best thing in the world in terms of animation quality, but they sure are consistent despite any infamous reputation they may get.\\n\r\nSOUND: Honestly, the soundtracks for this series are really good; for me, the opening and ending themes (except for the first OP, which is still not bad) are amazing. Sure, the soundtracks in this show overall may not be the most grandiose of things, but they really fit whenever needed, especially during the emotional and/or tense scenes, like the battles and the glorified deaths of some of the characters. There\u2019s not much else to say here, since taste in music really varies from person to person, in the end.\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: First things first\u2026.Theo Cornaro, the male protagonist, isn\u2019t the generic kind of male character that you\u2019d think he\u2019d be. Forget about the typical protagonist who hesitates to even touch a woman, much less think about a romantic relationship\u2026this guy not only reciprocates the main heroine\u2019s feelings for him (he kisses her more than once without hesitation, even in open public\u2026that\u2019s alpha shit right there LOL), but he even thought about the future of the romantic relationship as well. While it may seem that the MC is too calm and collected, he is actually not just some overpowered dude\u2026he really has had to rely on carefully planned-out strategies and tactics as well as the support from his companions/allies/friends. Yes, he does have some plot armor, but nowhere close to being the obnoxious kind that you\u2019d see in other male protagonists like Kirito from SAO, Ichigo from Bleach, and Sasuke from Naruto. He is also a pacifist, which is personally my favorite kind of character, which means he wants to avoid killing whenever possible, and if not, reduce the amount of blood shed no matter what.\\n\r\nThe female protagonist, Siluca, isn\u2019t just some helpless damsel-in-distress or obnoxious, prideful tsundere bijin. While she is unfettered with her goals and can be arrogant at times, she is shown to be a kind, polite, and understanding person\u2026she is also pretty smart as well, compared to most female heroines. I do also like she doesn\u2019t let her romantic relationship with Theo cloud her judgment and/or interfere too much with military and political matters.\\n\r\nThe main supporting cast have some very interesting qualities and personalities, even if they\u2019re considered clich\u00e9 by many people. A bunch of them actually do get a good amount of spotlight compared to support cast characters from other similar shows; at some points, the focus on some of those characters was so concentrated that I often briefly forget that Theo and Siluca are still the main characters in the show. A pet peeve I did have is that I wished that the sub-villain, Marrine, would be punished for her actions during the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d conflict, but when I considered from every perspective as to why she wasn\u2019t given brutal judgment, I can at least understand why she was spared. Honestly, if certain characters do really despicable things to really piss off the viewers on an emotional level, the show is doing shit right, imo, even if some viewers end up hating the show JUST because of that. Overall, the character department was well handled, though of course could\u2019ve been better.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I didn\u2019t really enjoy the show much during the first 6 to 9 episodes, but once the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d situation commenced, my interest perked up, cause I thought the journey was just gonna be the MC going to city after city in a simple one-way road and eventually bringing widespread peace after defeating the final boss\u2026but uh-uh, it was a bit more complicated than that. A lot of personal enjoyment also came from watching Theo reciprocate Siluca\u2019s feelings and even assert their relationship for everyone to see. I hate Milza and Marrine for what they did during the majority of the show, but I still think it counted as my enjoyment for the show, cause the buildup and payoff to see at least one of them meet their demise was quite satisfying. While I wasn\u2019t totally agreeing with Marrine being spared, to this day, I commended Theo staying true to his ideals to the point where he\u2019ll even spare his enemy. I also really enjoyed the battles, even as rushed as most of them were. Contrary to many people, I was quite okay with how the final confrontation wrapped up, even though I also knew it was hastened\u2026maybe I was because I already accepted that it was inevitably going to be stricken by poor pacing, anyways, and that there\u2019s no point in nitpicking about that.\\n\r\nOVERALL: I would honestly recommend this series to anyone who likes medieval-like fantasy shows, in general. Even with the bad pacing of the show, it\u2019s still a solid series overall\u2026several years ago, this show probably would\u2019ve gotten higher regards, imo. I\u2019ve seen plenty of other similar shows with higher ratings from 7.2 to 8.5 out of 10\u2026.that I thought really don\u2019t deserve those kinds of grades at all, tbh. My piece of advice would be to binge watch it, though, due to how fast the story progresses. If you still don\u2019t like it due to the obvious reasons, I can completely understand\u2026maybe this isn\u2019t the show for you\u2026perhaps you would\u2019ve liked fantasy shows with comedy and slice-of-life stuff, I guess. Even then, you\u2019ll still enjoy it by criticizing what you think it did wrong\u2026that still counts as enjoyment, right? In short, Grancrest Senki is a series with understandable flaws, especially as an LN adaptation, but not even halfway close to being a worst of the worst.\\n",

WARNING!\r\nPacing: \r\nWhere do I begin! The pacing of the anime is horrendous considering that this anime is projected to have 24 episodes. The story line moves so fast that you won't be able to remember what is going on. \r\nSummary of Plot:\r\nThe story is alright. It revolves around a young knight, Theo who tries to retake his homeland with the aid of a mage. \r\nCharacters:\r\nSome of the worst and dumbest characters you will ever see. One does not have sex with other people they don'tlike. One does not give up title in the name of love. One does not be brave and watch his girl suffer. One does not act like a wimp when he is king. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/5\\n\r\nThere are scenes of consensual rape. Girl falls in love with dude but has sex with another. Yeah, I didn't enjoy it after that. However, the MC is one of the smoothest MC you will ever see. His romance is pretty good in terms of anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nThe anime pacing leaves it hard for any watcher to steadily follow without having to hit playback. The artwork makes it easier  to watch but often music covers the sound of the anime. Characters are soft or stupid and there is no perfect one except the MC. I suggest to do better use of your time but I can't make you so just be warned. I tried my best to like this anime but I can't. \\n\\n\r\nLastly just read the Manga or LN because it is far better.\\n",

            "content": "So I've kept up with Gancrest Senki on a weekly basis as it's been released. And from what I've seen many of the reviews are of the first 2-5 episodes or so. And simply put, these reviews are not fair.\r\nThe story has a VERY odd start. Which seems to be the cause of many of the poor reviews. Yes the pacing is weird, and characters seem a little, everywhere... sometimes. But I've honestly been super interested in how the story has developed. There is a large cast so far and it has been an odd mix of supernatural (vampires, were-wolves and chaos demons), military, andpolitical. Some episodes are devoted almost entirely to the interactions of a few political leaders and the maneuvering, betrayals and diplomacy that occurs, while others are focused around the military conquest. And some pretty bad-ass fight scenes!\\n\\n\r\nThe MC should not truly be considered MC's at this point, as the plot is driven by the much larger political world that Gancrest Senki is set in, and I've personally been really drawn into seeing how this world develops!\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that this show does which i'm personally really liking is it is quite creative. Characters really begin to find their pacing and once the backstory for them is set their actions begin to make a lot of sense, even if the overall 'plot' is still being discovered. \\n\\n\r\nI really would hate to see this show suffocate and die before it can even begin. Sure it may absolutely flop, that's very much within the realms of possibility. BUT there is also a chance that this could be a really incredible show. Some of the BEST animes EVER MADE have really hard to watch starts that are confusing and slow. Think FMA, Steins Gate, hell even Gintama is hard for a lot of people to get into. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR:\\n\\n\r\nIF YOU'RE UNSURE ABOUT THIS ANIME, WAIT TILL ITS FULLY RELEASED AND THEN BINGE WATCH IT.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

(Not going to be a long full depth review)  \r\nMany people have compared the show to Record of Lodoss War, but as someone who has not watched this show here is an outsiders\u2019 opinion. I originally rated Grancest Senki an 8, but after the series finished and I had time to think about the anime I've revised that back down to a 7. Honestly, I feel that this show should have been split into 2seasons. \\n\\n\r\nThe show for me starts pretty slow, around mid-season is where I got really invested. I enjoyed the main characters development, the relationship that grew and the pacing the show had. The art style for me is good, it isn't however the best and the main plot of the story is pretty standard. Some of the moral questions of the show and the ways many characters go about protecting/gaining their goals/values I did enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nThe latter parts of the season is where things fell apart for me. After around ep 18/19 the pacing feels off, things really start the get moving and the whole viewing experience feels rushed. I know publishers only have a certain number of episodes to finish the story, but after the slow beginning and enjoyable paced mid-season this fast-paced ending does kind of annoy me. If this wasn't the case and everything was kept consistent i would of given the show a solid 8/10. However, after finishing it and giving it a bit of thought I'm going to have to give it a 7/10. Is the show enjoyable/entertaining? Yes. Would I recommend the show? Yes. Is the show a masterpiece? No. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n\\n",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nGlad this nightmare is finally over, now before I start I have an anology. Retarded brother of Game Of Thrones. That's basically what this series breaks down to. There are an inordinate amount of reasons as to why this crap is one of the worst series of the season and likely would be if not for a ridiculously shit season. *Cough* Devil's Line, Beatless, and pretty much everything released on Sunday *Cough*. Now, putting aside the other failures of this season, here is why Grancrest Senki (GCS) is a steaming pile. (Note, I'll take about GoT quite a bit because it's the perfect comparisondue to how antithetical GCS is to it.)\\n\\n\r\nI'll touch on the obvious things before relegating the story and characters. First and foremost, my fucking god was the animation awful, inconsistent and bland. Shit gave Devil's Line a run for it's money at times. GCS' animation was as lopsided as Carlos Rodriguez' skull. In fights in particular, the animation took a nose dive into the territory of dreadful often looking like a 5 year old's stop motion picture project. The colors for the whole of the anime remained bland, and monochromatic. You're not a social media website, you're an anime. Shading and mixing colors seem foriegn to this crap. The only time the animation was even presentable was during extremely slow paced scenes where it was easy to not suck.\\n\\n\r\nYou'll see a lot of people complaining about this in early on and it somewhat remained an early issue. For the first 6 or 7 episodes, give or take, GCS' pacing made Stein's;Gate's paceing look like a god's creation. Unlike Stein's;Gate, GCS never got good (Pun somewhat intended). The story and general atmosphere of the show jumped around like a paranoid schizophrenic on adderall and monster. Frequently jumping between characters, settings and story. This is part of the reason I like to call GCS retarded GoT, due to GCS' frequent\\n\r\nand poor attempt at mirroing GoT omniscent perspective. This issue becomes less pronouced 12 - 14 episodes in, but that's because all sembelence of sense and reason has left the show. Can't really judge the criminally insane on the basis of logic.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the fun parts. The story and characters. Words which I use loosely. The story is mediocre at best and compounded due to facts like awful characters, completely illogical developments and decisions, lack of lore, etc. First I'll touch on Chaos, an everpresent force in GCS. We're told it exists in the first few episodes, that it's a big fuckin' deal and never see it mentioned or present again until the end of the series. GCS has yet to properly explain what it is, where it really comes from, why it's a problem, etc. For the focal point of the \"Main Character\" and enemies power it sure didn't get much attention. Chaos, the base for magic, for lords, and the cause of the war is misunderstood at best. We have yet to get clear answers as to why it's a big deal and how it affects the world. A mark of a shit author in my esimation.\\n\\n\r\nNext I'll touch on the story a bit. Theo, a total Mary Sue, is seeking to save his home. Talk about a shocker. Then this dumbass manages to stumble into a war and become the hero the world needs because he's so damn nice, compassionate, righetous, just, devoted... Is the sarcasm sticking yet? Throw in a few boring enemies turned friends and friends turned enemies, a war, a dumb slut, a cuck and a religion and you got GCS in summary. Most of the characters I'll touch on in a bit, but their decisions and cause for the majority of the story are, frankly, moronic. \\n\\n\r\nThe aforementioned dumb slut left the aforementioned cuck at the altar because of reasons unrelated to him, threw away a peace treaty, the man she loves, an end to war, a unified country and an empire because... Wait why the fuck did she do this? Not for intellegent reasons I can tell you, and in my guess, is because the author couldn't contrive a logical reason for this war to shoe horn this borning ass protagonist in. The villains in this story appear for a couple episodes at a time, and their 'enemies' (The previously mentioned slut) are the focal point for the vast majority of the series. Another reason I call this retarded GoT. Theo & Co. and Dumb Slut & Co. are a pathetic parallel to Jon & Cersi, except you know, they're shit characters, Cersi is a lot more permanent evil than Dumb Slut, and the real enemy is far less interesting than the Walkers and their lore. Because unlike GoT not only is nothing explained, but there is ZERO foreshadowing or hints. Rewatching GoT there are gold mines of this all over the series. Ghost's red eyes and Jon's heritage, the death of the direwolf by stag and Ned's death by Cersi, Jamie's crippling, and a lot more. Rewatching GCS and I'm wondering why the fuck am I stupid enough to watch this, let alone rewatch it, in the first place. Comparisons aside. The most imporant parts, the motivations for the story are NEVER explained and the events remain entirely superficial. The wars are not only illogical but counter productive, the actualbattles infuriate me to due the sheer inaccuracy and impossiblity, and so on. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I touch on the characters, I'd like to speak of logic regarding the show. Putting aside magic, this show consitantly, multiple times a battle has sheer impossiblities at worst and fucking stupid ideas at best. We see some dipshit on a horse with a 16 inch blade at best. Less than an arms length. And anyone who know's what the hell they're talking about will tell you, if you have a blade less than an arms length while on a horse, not only are you a fucking idiot, but an ineffective, liable idiot. We see this idiot doing literally impossible damage. You cannot behead someone with such a toothpick while on a horse. You cannot use that aforementioned magic butter knife to pierce steel place armor when it's a kukri style blade, a fucking slashing weapon.Putting aside that particular gripe which stays present for over half the series, the war proceedings in this series are inaccurate to say the least. The war decisions often by the enemy are literally the worst possible decision coupled with sheer incompetence. Get a war historian, a marital artist or a soldier and watch the fighting scenes with them. Watch them pull their hair out and scream.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the 'characters'. I struggle to use that word since it would imply anyone in this series has character, let alone multiple people. \\n\r\nFirst Theo. Mary Sue. End of story. He's a boring, bland template designed for people to self insert into. He has zero depth or originality. His decisions are often illogical and idealistic. Literally no redeeming qualities as a 'character'.\\n\r\nSecond Marrine. Dumb cunt. End of story. Her decisions have zero logical basis and were not chosen because she or anyone genuinely thought they were the right decisions but to contrive a story. Also zero depth as a character and is more a caricature of a faux temporary enemy.\\n\r\nAlexis. Cuck. Not quite the end of story. A small step up from other characters, though still in general a dimwit.\\n\r\nSiluca. Half decent. Can't really tell if it's because she's actually any good or because all the other characters are total garbage. A number of her decisions, actions and character as a whole are fairly reasonable and believable. Certainly not a great character but in the context of this show, a good one and definitely the best in the series. Not like she has much competition though. \\n\r\nPretty much every other character is forgettable at best, don't elicit much emotion and don't contain any particular significant amount of quality. Certainly not as bad as the first three I mentioned but that's because they're all pretty much cookie cutter characters.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in summary, if you like Game of Thrones, if you like anime and you don't give a shit about actual quality, then this flaming pile of shit is for you. I'd say this mutilation of anime is probably the worst thing this season, maybe even one of the worst anime to ever air, since the things that are worse usually aren't even attempts, at least I sure fucking hope, at making a decent anime. This probably is, though certainly not a good one. Honestly, I'm proud of myself for enduring through 24 episodes of this and if anyone doesn't believe me or is as crazy as I am, watch it, be my guest, though don't say I didn't warn you. This disgusting, malformed mutilation of anime while drive you to your wits end, assuming you have them.",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Record of Grancrest War and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. \r\nBased off a popular light novel of the same name Record of Grancrest War is an action and fantasy anime that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if a wandering knight and a powerful but determined mage were to unite their powers and gather like minded individuals to fight against both the rampant chaos that is causing endless wars acrossthe land and the two large power blocks of countries that are taking advantage of the chaos to fight wars against each other. \\n\\n\r\nBut rather than fight for conquest and wealth as the members of the two power blocks do the knight and his companions fight instead to unite the land and all the crests and create an era where peace will reign for all races whether human, beast man, union or alliance by creating the ultimate crest the grand crest that will unite the land against the common foe of chaos. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place on the continent of Atlatan a setting that combines medieval-era weaponry and tactics with the magic and creatures that is commonly seen in high fantasy settings is a world that is similar to our own one where humanity and every race that lives on the continent fight constantly with one another in endless wars using the supernatural powers offered by the crests which are both symbols of ranks and a representation of the powers that they wield. The most powerful of these lords form military alliances with one another with the largest being the Fantasia Union and their opposite number the Factory alliance whose struggles with one another have lasted for years. After the tragic events at a wedding that was supposed to have been the beginning of peace between the two factions, both sides withdraw and began to prepare for a resumption of hostilities between them that had been held in check by the wedding. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story follows the life of Theo Cornado a wandering knight that aspires to create a world where peace will reign for all countries and his encounter with Siluca Meletes a 17-year-old mage that has similar aspirations as his own and their journey to gather as many crests as they can to create the ultimate crest that will banish chaos from this war-torn world the grand crest. Along the way, they will fight many powerful lords and their attendant mages while at the same time encounter many like minded individuals that share their desire to create a world of peace. But their journey while noble would pit them against the lords of both the union and the factory alliance who refuse to let go of the powers that their crests have bestowed them with and Theo and Siluca must use every inch of their cunning and intelligence to overcome the myriad enemies that try to stop them as they strive to create a world free of war. As they fight across the land to enact their bold plan, Theo, Siluca and their many allies would encounter a host of characters that will both aid them and hinder their quest that includes the calm and bold Marrine leader of the Factory alliance, the kind and motivational priestess Priscilla and the confident and perceptive Duke of Alturk Villar. But in their journey to create a world of peace not even the demons of hell can hope to stop them. \\n\\n\r\nSiluca Meletes \\n\\n\r\nSilica Meletes voiced by veteran seiyuu Akari Kito of Classroom of the Elite fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A 17-year-old mage freshly graduated from the mage academy Siluca is an intelligent, assertive and fiercely independent person by nature that views the current world and the lords that are responsible for it with nothing but scorn and disdain. A perceptive and quick-thinking person by nature Siluca though a mage is also a capable strategist and diplomat capable of both planning intricate battle strategies as well as creative proposals that can charm even the most stubborn lords and get them to help them. While a cunning person by nature Siluca is someone that is both humble and willing to learn and rather than use this cunning to make a name for herself as others would instead uses this to analyse and defeat the plans that their opponents use against them whether these plans are military or diplomatic. Key to Siluca\u2019s ability to defeat the many plans of her opponents is Siluca\u2019s tenacious nature and her dislike of people that take advantage of their powers to lead others astray. As a result of this hatred, Siluca is someone that hates rotten mages as she believes they are not doing their jobs properly an aspect that comes largely from the proudness she feels as a mage that\u2019s loyal to her contractor. \\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the series, Siluca as a result of her independent personality was not someone that many people could get close to and indeed in the beginning due to her pride she was somewhat haughty and prideful. However, while hard to please Siluca was someone that respected results and hard work and had no problem with praising those that she had seen work hard at their assigned tasks. While Siluca\u2019s tactics are based off what her intelligence and analysis have told her it can be seen that like her personality Siluca\u2019s tactics and strategies has a flair for the dramatic and were somewhat risky at the same time. This I felt was interesting as it matched well with her development as a character as while her early tactics were dramatic and risky as the series goes on this changes largely due to the effect that Theo\u2019s beliefs have on her. As the series goes on and as Siluca encounters and befriends many new allies and reconnect with former friends it can be seen that Siluca actually starts to rid herself of her haughty and prideful nature and instead starts treating her allies with respect and starts trusting them with critical parts of her plans but at the same time not risking them by taking care of the most dangerous parts of her plan herself showing the care that she has developed for her friends and allies. A central aspect of Siluca\u2019s character is, of course, her dislike of authority and of lords which creates a problem in that she isn\u2019t afraid to state her own opinion on something which often causes her to tread into dangerous territory. However, as the series goes on though not disappearing entirely Siluca gains the foresight to know when it is time to offer her opinion and when not to but always willing to offer her advice when needed. At the beginning of the series, Siluca and Theo had a rather unusual first encounter and as a result, had a somewhat tense relationship at first.\\n\\n\r\n As a result of wanting to prove herself and show her skills to others at the beginning of the series, Silica treated Theo rather poorly. While acknowledging Theo as her contractor and lord the strategies that Siluca came up with in the beginning while highly effective at their intended role did not include Theo in them which had the effect of causing her name to rise but not her lord\u2019s that she was supposed to be serving. As Siluca and Theo\u2019s relationship deepens as the series goes on Siluca realises the error that she had made as she has let her pride overrule her duty to her lord something that she chided herself on. As a result of this as the series goes on Siluca\u2019s relationship with Theo gradually changes with Siluca gradually being more open with him and willing to discuss her strategies and tactics with him showing her increasing trust and later admiration of Theo\u2019s actions and beliefs and becoming his loyal right hand in his quest to unite the crests. The character of Siluca I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed. The evolution of Siluca from a haughty and prideful mage that was overconfident of her intellect and skills as a mage to one that was both humble, trusting and friendly to her allies and loyal and dedicated to not just her lord but to his beliefs as well I thought was really well done. I felt that her seiyuu Akari Kito really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Siluca. \\n\\n\r\nTheo Cornaro \\n\\n\r\nTheo Cornaro played by new voice actor Kentaro Kumagai is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. Initially, a wandering knight that Siluca encounters while on her way to her new assignment Theo is a righteous, determined and proud person by nature that\u2019s also understanding and trusting of his allies and friends. Unlike the great majority of knights and lords that use their crests to gain fame and power Theo largely due to his modest nature and his strong sense of justice is the opposite and instead fights to protect the innocents that are caught in the conflicts that plague the land and true to this nature strives to fight his battles far from populated areas. A brave, loyal and friendly person by nature Theo is someone that can be said to be the very ideal image of a knight one that is both caring towards his friends and allies and brave and willing to step in and protect them from the most dangerous threats in this world the demons without any hesitation. As a result of this personality its perhaps unsurprising that Theo views the current chaos that the continent is locked in with disdain and indeed Theo is someone that believes that the crests that the knights and lords make use of should be used to help and protect the people from the chaos that reigns in the land and not be used to fight endless and pointless wars with one another and definitely not for personal gain. In line with this is what can be said to be Theo\u2019s ultimate dream and wish which is to change the current world and create a world where peace will reign for all humans and races whether they belong to the union, factory alliance and unaffiliated races. A world where everyone can exist in harmony with one another without having to fight one another on the field of battle to settle differences of opinion. \\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the series Theo while having a worthy dream and vision was someone that was noted to not have much ambition and seems content with just fighting to protect the land and its people and in the process accumulate more power to power his crest. This attitude while matching his temperament nicely was seen as impractical by his allies and as the series progresses even Theo starts to realise this as well. As the series goes on and Theo begins to see just how much suffering the people of the land suffer due to the chaos and the wars between the various crest holders this awakens within Theo a desire to not just become a lord but also to be one that has gathered all the crests to form the grand crest that will end this suffering and bring peace back to the land. However even after becoming a lord and taking the first step on his journey to achieve his dream Theo rather than let his new station create a sense of ambition within him instead bravely maintains his core values always striving to fight for justice and freedom while preferring to exhaust all avenues of diplomacy first before committing to an action. Unlike most lords on the continent, Theo is shown to be someone that values the opinions of his subordinates and always willing to listen to their own assessments of the situation before deciding on a course of action. As a result of his long life as a knight, Theo is someone that has always believed that a knight\u2019s duty is to protect the people and even after rising to become a lord this belief never changes and stayed with him. As a result of this Theo was someone that was uncomfortable with having his subordinates and allies fight for him while he can only command them and not fight alongside them. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, as the series progresses this sense of unease gradually disappears as Theo comes to realise that the reason that his subordinates and allies fight so hard for him even against tall odds was because of the faith and trust that they have in their lord and his beliefs and as a result rather than feel unease and worried about them Theo instead takes it and uses it as his main strength and motivation. As a character I felt that Theo was one that was both well designed and developed with his development from a wandering knight that had the barest idea of a dream to one that was determined to change the world and create a world where peace will reign for everyone no matter the odds arrayed against him being the best aspects of his character. \\n\\n\r\nMarrine Kreische \\n\\n\r\nMarrine voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Guilty Crown and Anohana fame is one of the main support characters of the series. The daughter of the former archduke of the Factory alliance and after his death the new leader of the Factory alliance Marrine is a calm, composed and understanding person by nature that\u2019s also perceptive and cautious and is shown to be a person that\u2019s easily capable to telling one\u2019s true character quite easily. An intelligent and logical young woman Marrine is someone that respects those that show courage and determination and is someone that places her trust in allies and friends that have proved their worth to her treating them as valued allies that she can rely on.  While an intelligent and shrewd negotiator, politician and a capable field commander and swordswoman Marrine is not someone that will underestimate enemies and indeed has a healthy amount of respect for all that stand in her way whether they are of the same social rank as she is or not. While a capable field commander Marrine is shown to be someone that largely lets his subordinates make their own decisions on the field preferring instead to observe their actions and only stepping in when needed. This is shown in both her time on the field and her time managing the lords that form part of her alliance. In line with this is Marrine\u2019s belief that the men under her should serve on their own volition and that she shall not force them to serve her blindly due to a perceived loyalty to her family name. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series progresses and Marrine\u2019s personality and character gets expanded upon it can be seen that while outwardly Marrine is a very strong-willed and determined woman that\u2019s determined to achieve her goal of uniting the continent under her rule beneath this Marrine\u2019s feelings are anything but strong and is in fact relatively fragile. As a result of losing both her beloved father and be split from the person that she had fallen in love with at the beginning of the series Marrine was forced to harden her heart and banish the grief that anyone in her situation would be feeling and concentrate on the larger picture of fighting the true enemy that has caused the tragedy. Despite taking the path of a conqueror and being labelled as a villain by all it can be seen that Marrine is someone that tries to minimise the number of casualties when possible by making use of negotiation which shows that beneath her determination to unite the land her human side still remains to a degree. As the series goes on it can be seen that Marrine while very determined to achieve her dream of uniting the continent still wrestles with the human side of her character and despite seemingly giving up her happiness to focus on trying to achieve her dream which is best summed up in her belief that she is someone that is stained with blood and not someone that is worthy of happiness there are still feelings and emotions that she cannot get rid of within her namely her remnant feelings for her former fiance Alexis. The character of Marrine I thought was one that was both well designed and developed with her development from a young woman that was on the Verge of marrying the prince of her dreams to a determined and driven conqueror who aspires to unite the land to honour her father while cutting off every side of her that made her the person that she once was on a quest to find the truth being one of the best aspects of her character. The concept of becoming a conqueror that aspires to conquer the land to find the truth while shouldering all the blame and resentment of others I felt was an admirable concept that matched the strong-willed Marrine very well. I felt that her seiyuu Ai Kayano really did an excellent job of portraying the character of Marrine in the first villain role of her career.  \\n\\n\r\nPriscilla\\n\\n\r\nPriscilla voiced by veteran seiyuu Natsumi Takamori of Orange and Brave Witches fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Theo and Siluca\u2019s many allies in their quest to unite the crests. A priestess of the order of the crest a religious order that accesses, awards and distributes the crests to the lords and knights of the continent Priscilla is also the daughter of the founder of that order making her a relatively famous person within it.  True to her role as both a priestess and a healer Priscilla is a kind, caring and understanding person by nature that cares deeply about everyone that she meets and would not hesitate to put herself in danger if it means it will help people that are injured or need renewed faith. While a quiet person by nature Priscilla is an intelligent and perceptive person by nature and can easily tell when something is bothering someone and as a result like Siluca she serves as one of Theo\u2019s most trusted advisers where her role as a priestess and her skills at diplomacy can be put to good use. \\n\\n\r\n As a result of both her beliefs and what she has seen across the land as a member of the order, it can be seen that Priscilla is someone that hates dictators and those that commit acts of cruelty using the crests that her order has awarded.  As a result of this upon hearing about Theo\u2019s dream, Priscilla was among the first to make their way to him to determine whether Theo is the light that this world so dearly needs. In line with Priscilla\u2019s training as a priestess, Priscilla was noted to be someone that was very motivational that was helped greatly in the faith that she has both with Theo and with the central teachings of the order of crests and was capable of swinging the opinion of large crowds of people quite easily. The most prominent trait of Priscilla\u2019s is without a doubt the special crest that she wields which has the miraculous power of putting Priscilla within a trance that allows her to heal even the fatal of injuries a power that I felt was really appropriate for a priestess healer like Priscilla. The character of Priscilla while largely a support character I felt fulfilled a very important role for Theo and his faction as she served not just as the factions most effective healer but also one that was able to offer Theo many useful pieces of advice that he needed as he fought ever harder battles against increasingly powerful enemies in his quest to end the chaos. Priscilla\u2019s title of holy maiden that referred to both her role as a priestess and her special crest I felt was one that was really appropriate for her and a title that she really deserved.  \\n\\n\r\nVillar \\n\\n\r\nVillar Constance played by veteran voice actor Takahiro Sakurai of Bungo Stray Dogs and Log Horizon fame is one of the main support characters of the series and an important ally of both Theo and Siluca. The Duke of Alturk a country that\u2019s part of the union and one of its most influential members Villar is an intelligent, confident and perceptive man that is well versed in both diplomacy and military arts and as a result is highly regarded by all those that know him. While a confident person by nature Villar unlike most lords at his station is not someone that is overconfident and indeed Villar is someone that is humble and kind and treats everyone that he meets with respect and humility no matter their station. A calm and patient person by nature Villar is also considerate and possesses considerable foresight that allows him to project both calmness in meetings and anticipate the types of issues that may come up at a meeting to a certain degree. While a proud person Villar is shown to be someone that values the lives of his subordinates and would always try to preserve their lives and stop them from taking part in reckless actions which are best shown in the battles that he took part in prior to the fall of castle unicorn. As a result of this Villar is someone that has earned the respect and loyalty of countless lords that live nearby a feat that proved useful during the defence of Alturk from the factory alliance. Unlike other lords of the continent who tend to view those of lower social rank than they are with disdain Villar is unique in that he is someone that prefers to judge someone by their merits and deeds rather than say their family name an aspect that I felt suited his personality greatly. A core personality trait that is unique to Villar is the importance that he places on family largely due to his past experience with his own. \\n\\n\r\nAs a result of this trait, Villar is someone that values family highly and dislikes having to fight members of his own family on the battlefield. A key aspect of Villar\u2019s personality that resonates with this is his cardinal rule about the female mages that are contracted to him in that once they reach the age of 25 they must retire and leave his service. This unusual rule through a logical one has earned Villar many nefarious nicknames but the core reason for this rule is because Villar wants to give these women the opportunity to marry and create a family of their own. The character of Villar Constance I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with his character as a powerful but fair duke that commanded the respect and loyalty of his people and his fellow lords through his determined attempts to preserve their lives being the best aspects of his character as he was the opposite of what many of the lords that fight in this war were like. In a way, Villar can be said to be the ideal image of what a lord should be for even against overwhelming odds Villar still faced them bravely not compromising on any of his core values fighting to the very end to save others and ensure their happiness. I felt that his voice actor Takahiro Sakurai really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Villar Constance. \\n\\n\r\nAmv \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise I felt that the various locations and settings that the cast visit over the course of the series was not just beautiful and well designed but also showed a great variety of terrain types that matched well with the theme of a large continent-wide war that served as the series main premise. The character designs for each of the main cast I felt were also well done and each character I felt matched well with both their personality and intended role within the series with their clothing, in particular, being a great complement to their designs. The use of magic within the series which serves as one of the series key premises in the form of the crest I felt was well done not just in the execution of large-scale magic but also in the form of the crests and the effect they have on the casters subordinates as well. The idea that each crest acted not just as an identifier for the soldiers but also gave them a semblance of their lord\u2019s power I felt was a nice touch. In terms of large-scale battles whether its land-based or naval I felt that the battles that were featured within the series were both well animated and designed and made great use of both the fantasy setting as well as that of tactics and terrain. Each battle while large and often consisting of multiple fronts was well animated and allowed us to see clearly which side was winning in brutal detail thanks to distinctive combat gear that was used by all sides. Music wise I felt that the series OST was really well done and did a great job at highlighting the various scenes and emotions and feelings that the cast experience as they fight in this war to end all wars. The series opening and ending themes of which there were four in total which was Starry by veteran singer Mashiro Ayano, Pledge by Asca, and Rin and Shodo by Asca and Ayano respectively I felt was pretty strong songs that complemented the series really well. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, I felt that each member of the voice cast was able to do an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I feel that Akari Kito, Kentaro Kumagai, Ai Kayano, Natsumi Takamori and Takahiro Sakurai all deserve special praise as I felt that they all did an excellent job of portraying the characters of Siluca, Theo, Marrine, Priscilla, and Villar. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Record of Grancrest War I felt was an excellent anime and alongside Beatless, Darling in the Franxx and Katana Maidens is one of the heavy hitters of Winter 2018 with its main strong points being its strong premise, excellent story, well designed and developed characters, great blend of politics, wishes and war, a strong voice cast and its many large and well-designed battles. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall premise of the series was, of course, the continental-wide war within the series that pitted large military alliances against each other in a large war in which both sides sought to gain power by defeating their enemies and gaining the superhuman powers that the crests a concept unique to the series contains. While battles of this type are a common theme in most action anime the fact that this took place within a large fantasy world that had both magic and industry within it I felt was interesting as this kind of promise is relatively rare among anime\u2019s and more common in movies. While the war large as it is involved countless lords, all fighting to gain power in order to rule more land and thus gain more prestige the real premise came in the surprising form of a minor knight that had large aspirations that were surprising for someone of his standing and station an aspiration to create a world where peace would reign. In a world filled with power hungry lords who fight continuously to gain power the idea that a mere knight would not just possess one of the mythical crests but also have a unique wish and desire to use that crest to fight and create a better world for the people I thought was rather special. While weak as an individual Theo while facing intense opposition for his plan never feels fear and never wavers in his beliefs and wishes to create a better world and as he fights and triumphs over every battle sent his way Theo not just matures and changes from a knight to a lord but also gain many allies and friends who share his view of wanting to create a new world free of chaos. Even when faced with the large military alliances of the alliance and the union Theo does not feel fear and managed to not only outfight his opponents and also outsmart them and convince them through sword and words to work with him and finally end this time of chaos. This premise of having a minor knight rise to power and promote a plan of peace to all factions with not just military action but also diplomacy I felt was interesting and made great use of the fact that all humans and races whether they are knights, lords or simple soldiers all wish for a day where they can drop their weapons and armour and live their life without having to kill another fellow human being. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story of the series in addition to the premise I felt was also one of the series main strong points. While largely following Theos advances and development as both a character and a lord the story also gave us the opportunity to see how the two alliances of the series the Union and the Factory alliance fought the war and the problems that they had to deal with as the tides of war changed as the war went on. This aspect of switching between not just Theo and his allies but between Marrine\u2019s Factory alliance and Alexis\u2019s Union alliance I thought was well done as it showed that this war is taking place on multiple fronts and that Theo and his forces are though an important part of the war still only one part of a larger war that\u2019s sweeping the continent. Key to this is the usage of several key characters that are used by all factions to keep each other in check as each faction fights to conquer important territory in their quest for victory with the most notable of this being the character of Mirza who while originally a prince of a nearby country and Villar\u2019s ally soon becomes one of Theo\u2019s greatest threats thanks to his ambition. When paired with the politics that existed between the lords and the alliances and the large-scale battles that formed the key parts of the story Grancrests story proved to be really impressive as it was anything but predictable and was full of unexpected developments, betrayals, and revelations that played out more like a movie than an anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Record of Grancrest War was an anime that I really enjoyed watching with its main strong points being its strong and unique premise, excellent story, well-designed characters, strong blend of politics and war, strong voice cast and large and well designed and executed battles. I felt that the series handled its many different themes relatively well with the handling of its core theme of defeating and forcing each faction to the negotiation table to end the war and unite them against the real threat being the best one. Seeing Theo, the minor knight not only gain ranks as he overcomes the countless trials that he was faced with but also gain many powerful and loyal friends and allies that share as his goals as he tries to change the world was one of the best things about this anime and proves that if you have a strong will and powerful and like-minded friends that anything is possible even the impossible task of changing the world. As a final score, I would say that Record of Grancrest War easily deserves a final score of 10/10. In order to free his homeland and bring peace to it, Theo instead ended up changing the world. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I see this series using the \"noble\" commoner becoming lord/king with the help of others. While this type of story may not be awful, this anime fails to write a compelling narrative or \"adventure\" for the protagonist.\r\nI am going to start with the world of Grancrest Senki. There are two factions Alliance and Union, both in which are lead by people who inherited their positions from their parents. This show tries to get the audience to care about these individuals, however I cannot sympathize with them at all due to their actions and respect given to them despite them not earning it or be deservingof it. In a world where strength determines rank, it seems the highest \"ranked people\" cannot defend themselves and require their subordinates to aid them at every turn. How did these people get so highly ranked I wonder? Does inheritance also give you power/ \"crest\"?\\n\\n\r\nThis leads into my next point, questions. This narrative has little backstory and tremendous vagueness, some of the questions you may ask include:\\n\r\nWhat are lord laws? How do crests work? How many races exist in this world (i.e. supernatural)? Why does the Alliance and Union fight (i.e. motives? was one of the leaders a tyrant perhaps)? How is one guy with a dagger so feared (he doesn't even use his \"crest\")? Is Villar actually a womanizer (he picks hot women and makes them wear skimpy uniforms)? Doesn't that seem  like his words don't match his actions?\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I believe there to be quite a few negatives, if you like good action over plot and a rated E romance (I don't count episode 9) you can find it here. Overall good for boredom. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Well i both read the manga and watch the anime until ep 14 for now (dunno about LN though). This was one of the type that had a bad early impact, and tend to be shot-down on first- 12Eps. BUT In reality it was a prety gud one in overal series, people just got fed up on the bad review it has got.\r\nHave u ever watch \"Altair: A Record of Battles\" (Shoukoku no Altair), yeah the set is almost same. Unlike Altair, Grancrest setting was set on a Medieval Balkan State (yes, it's represent south-eastern europe when i saw on grancrest map). BUT Grancrest slightlybit darker, it's true it got rape on Ep 9 (although it not fully showed) and couple bit of decapitated death by stab & slashing. What would u expect, this was a SEINEN with classic MEDIEVAL WAR (with a magic unlike Shoukoku no Altair ). \\n\\n\r\nBoth Anime and manga has a bad pacing, but it wont steal the enjoyment !!. the story was actually PRETTY GUD especially for this 2018 Winter-Spring Season.  Don't believe me ?, Just compare it to Killing Bites (in term of seinen genre).\\n\r\nIt has a GUD decent art, u can see they did best unlike some half ass anime production this season had. it has FINE sound and voice acting. This series offer best female MC, just like other reviewer says and a fine char development. \\n\\n\r\nThis work intended to have more action rather than Smart explanation, well it has a set (tight) budget i guess. But once u dig on it u wont stop, especially ppl who love this kind of genre specifically. So I RECOMMEND TO MARATHON THIS, it means u SHOULD WAIT until all of them Finished airing then u can enjoy dem to the fullest. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPeople always Quick judged and make a bad review,  IF U DON\"T LIKE IT THEN DON\"T WRITE A REVIEW OF IT !!!. U R NOT WORTHY !!. Just Write review from the show or genre dat u would enjoy. \\n\r\nfor exapmle it's like \"U don't like gore but you watch a gore anime and review it bad and etc\".\\n\\n",

            "content": "I am on 13/24 and this is my opinion:\r\n1. The Art is Meh.  It is not impressive, nothing special. It's ok. I don't like the hair or the costumes.\r\n2. The story is great.  It's like what game of thrones could've been if HBO could just for one minute focus on plot instead of gratitous violence. How many times do we need to see a psychopath be a psychopath before we get that they are a psychopath?  How many breasts must we see in order to know that yes,women have breasts?  (end of my rant,yes I have read the books, stopped afterfinishing number 3)\\n\\n\r\n3. Back to the story: essentially we see medieval europe with magic.  The continent is divided, primarily because of crests which gives magical power (not a lot, the magic is very minimal).  The Alliance is led by Merinne, the Union by her ex-fiancee Alexis.  In the middle is the Earl of Altar, a charismatic man who wants to achieve unity, but not through the ruthless methods of Merine.  He surrounds himself with loyal people, including our main characters, Theo and Siluca.\\n\\n\r\n4. Which Leads Me to Characters: while every character embraces a thematic archetype there are a lot of dynamic characters. What I love the most is that the show is not so serious that it is bleak, and the hero is not perfect,but more importantly, it avoids the annoying goofiness that has been a cop out for good writing for what seems like the last decade.  It's like shounen/seinen/shoujo stupidness where a character breaks character in order to appear 'funny' but fails, nor does the show have an over fixation on sex.  The subject matter is handled surprisingly well\\n\\n\r\n5.  Again, you will see a lot of thematic elements/influences including Sparta, Italian City States Warring with one another, and just straight up medieval war.  And arguably most importantly, EVERY CHARACTER IS GENUINE.  Every person has a reason for what they do, and they believe it is the best choice.  The Alliance believes that peace can only be achieved through ruthlessly cutting down anyone who opposes them.  Miraz believes that the weak deserve to die and those without ambition are worthless (he kinda reminds me of vlad the impaler meets social darwinism). Altric is a classic politician, Theo hopes to unite everyone by gaining theloyalty and trust of others but acknowledges the reality that he has to kill people.  Give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\n6.Conclusion: I really was impressed and enjoyed writing it.  I don't watch a lot of anime (preferring C-Dramas and K-Dramas).  Anime that I have liked include Shinsekai Yori and Kyoukai no Kanata.  \\n\\n\r\nSIDENOTE: I have seen complaints for episode 9.  It is a harsh episode because a character chooses to sleep with someone to gain a powerful ally.  I thought it was very symbolic because 1)she is showing just how ruthless she is,willing to sacrifice anything,including something she would have given to another (not to mention virginity is still kind of important) and 2)it shows the   Man she is sleeping with that she is ambitious and gains his respect--and sword",

I suggest for the audience to be above 17 yearsold because it contains many murder scenes that are not well imitated by children.",

Just to promote the war.\\n\r\nAll she is promoting was war from all i can see \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is about uniting the whole kingdom or whatever it is or ruling them to form a grand crest that will help them fight against the chaos thing and will help it end\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, right at the start the two alliances are about to be joined by marriage and they even love each other.\\n\r\nAnd right after the girl father dies,, the marriage is done and dusted just like that,, she leaves like it was the boys fault that her father dies, i know there were people trying to stop that marriage,.so that the alliance wont join..but wouldnt they have won against those perpetrator instead the girl chooses to leave giving those perpetrators a win.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the war starts..war continues, from nothing\\n\\n\r\nTheo (mc) defeats one lord to gain crest.\\n\r\nThe girl Siluca(mage) announces to be from union in the midst of alliance and  their domain would be surrounded by the enemies (ofc they would get atked) and alliance domain rulers attack that was obvious\\n\r\nwhats that girl SIluca intention just to promote war ..huh\\n\\n\r\nAnd then the girl tries to ally with alliance after first announcing oneself as from union and then beating some alliance nations  (really )\\n\r\nya he would definitely deny that ..why would he not.\\n\\n\r\nAnd like that war escalates from nothing \\n\\n\r\nAnd the Alexis(leader) from union who still loves the Marrinel(leader) of alliance , and is constantly seeking peace ,,why is that girl hell bent on fighting, i dont know, if she loved him.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to top it up that girl intention is to unite the whole continent..wouldnt just going back to the loved ones and merging them solve the problem if that was her intention.\\n\\n\r\nHer own domain leaders are not aligning with her ..they dont want to be under her..so what she does try to subjugate them.. i guess thats obvious choice if she wanted to unite all\\n\\n\r\nBut she accepted to sleep with another just so that he would help her in her dream of uniting continent..How weak his her alliance if the leader has to throw pride and all to get the help of one nation.\\n\r\nIf she acts like that,\\n\r\nThe Union clearly has greater power than Alliance and is easier for alliance to fulfill the dream of uniting the continent. So, she just want to hang onto power i guess .\\n\\n\r\nI am just focusing on uniting continent thing..if she could throw her chastity for her grand idea of uniting continent ,,could she not have tried to again form the coeoperation between alliance and order, i think that would have lots easier..Even her aide (domains leader) are supporting the idea (may not be all but thats clearly easier in my opinion..she is a leader ..and when united she could subjugate those who are not in agreement but no i will fight my own domain , whole world lol.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI dont know how come there is war ,,cause they have that peace treaty..and the peace treaty is not broken by an associate or whole nation. It was theo starting the war after taking that domain ?? \\n\\n\r\nAnd also isnt it a priority first to fight against chaos \\n\\n\r\n(I know wars are hard to stop by once started and peace is hard to maintain , to follow )\\n\\n",

Most of the people leaving bad reviews either didn't watch the whole show or are simply overly critical pieces of crap. Many of them think an anime has to abide by a specific list of criteria and thus rate it accordingly. Many people seem that they can't just enjoy an anime for what it is. \r\nThis show is incredible! It takes about 10 episodes for it to really get good but it's worth it. Now I'llbe honest the score isn't anything special and the animation and fight scenes aren't anything spectacular. It just wasn't that popular of a manga really and so didn't get as much funding. Other people talk about how the pacing is awful. News flash...it was clearly done on purpose. It gives the show a sense of urgency and makes it that much more exciting. There's also just so much going on politically, tactically, etc that the show jumps around making sure the viewer can understand the hectic Ness of this world. \\n\\n\r\nPlease! Please! Give this show a chance and enjoy it for what it is. It's such a shame these days that truly great anime don't get the hype they deserve where as incredibly average shows like AOT get unwavering priase even though it has way worse pacing and character development than this show. \\n\\n\r\nThanks!",

            "content": "I LOVE sword and sorcery anime, which is why it is such a shame that this is perhaps the greatest example of what NOT to do with pacing. This is a no-spoiler review.\r\nOur hero character, Theo, starts practically from scratch alongside a trusty and prodigious mage babe named Siluca. Their goal is to advance their status from nobodies to lords, and to accomplish this they slowly gather an army and the archetypal specialists that you would expect from fantasy (mage, assassin, etc.) \r\nSounds interesting so far right? \r\nUnfortunately there are some serious problems with this show. The pacing is all over the place--often feeling incrediblyrushed, especially in the beginning episodes. The story is also generally incoherent at times, opting to throw fantastical things at you instead of taking the time to explore one item and flush it out. I was often left scratching my head and the use of 'tactics' and 'strategy' in this war anime were laughable, choosing to just declare nonsense as something that worked. \\n\\n\r\nFor the first few episodes, the hero never loses and one combatant or another comes to him with ease--everything comes incredibly easy to him in fact, offering little opportunity to display anything in the way of actual character growth or intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nFor those reasons i had to drop it early, as any show that takes too long to actually become entertaining simply isn't worth the time--and to be honest, i have never been so disappointed in a fantasy anime like this before.\\n\\n\r\nAll the ingredients for a decent show seemed to be there, but what resulted from them was nothing but a slog. There seems to have been some squandered potential here imo, which is a shame really as if they had considerably tightened up the pacing and put more effort into making the events seem more believable rather than the ultimately shallow, nonsensical wish fulfillment it is, it might have been pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are really into swords and sorcery like i am, this is probably only worth watching if you have already watched everything else, and so have nothing better to entertain yourself with.",

BEWARE of slight SPOILERS! because after you read this you might cringe a bit and be discourage to continue and watch. But don't worry this anime is gewd and i recommend it for matures only R18 + or so. Because there's no way a 17 yr old down could understand all of this you need an open mind in order for you to comprehend.\r\nSTORY: Awwwwweeee! Love conquers all! Even if its NTR! Not just like any NTR though! its like THE FEELING THAT YOUR BEINGCUCKOLD! yeah i just spoiled you! So you should be prepared! Because honestly I somehow find it a lil bit cringy at the same time satisfying at the end I dunno why, but i just feel that way. Eventhough that person deserves the worst possible ending/outcome, i somehow manage to \"sympathize\" or understand the goals and the sacrifices that must be made in order to protect someone even if it takes you to dirty your own hands and keep those burdens/sins for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nSo its about Theo the main male character of this story who just escaped his country vowing to return and liberate his people someday. As he was wandering around he stumbles upon a beautiful young female mage named Siluca (honestly speaking she reminds me of Sistine Fibel from Akashic Records only HOTTER!) she was on her way to meet a duke and he somehow manages to rescue her from the oppressors. As she witnessed this ManBoy in a sweaty and sexy action (to sound more dramatic and sexy) she acknowledges his potential to be a lord and they began a contract that he would become a lord and she will become his Mage forever. Sounds sweet. And so their Adventure begins as they continue to fight their own battle not knowing the dangers and the dark truth unravelling that has been hidden for eons. Okay for those who watched it already some may say that the story is kinda rushed, but for me its okay. Coz i already get the picture, whats the need to prolong such a scene if you already know or understand the rest of it? Might as well skip to the main topic Right? So yeah there it is. The plot of this anime composed of mideival scenes and fantasy where you'll find Vikings, Spartans, The English, Arabians, and also with Vampires, werewolves, demons, and witches. I know it sounds confusing, but believe me the names in this is far more confusing it may take a few episodes to understand on who's who. The story is vast really and its quite entertaining and besides it ends with a happy ending so i'll give it 8/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: Art is awesome! Two \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Not so much 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Interesting enough but fot me best girl is Siluca she stays true to her words never wavering! 8/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Well I did enjoy some parts of it but there were parts that was borring and some parts interesting and some parts sad and some parts cringy. So its like a roller coaster of emotions. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: well i have said pretty much everything that i have to say so i'll give it an 8/10. And oh BTW if you want something cool to watch with a female lead try watching CROSSANGE i bet some of you would definitely enjoy this gem just give it a try! Sayonara!",

The narrative is all over the place to begin with, but the biggest issue, BY FAR, is how Grancrest Senki breaks its own neck with the speed at which it progresses through said plot; they seemingly skip across 2 or 3 season worth of possible content in just 24 episodes. The end result is a fantasy/adventure/romance series with all of the pieces, but none of the magical feel.\r\nThe animation ranges from really good to really bad, sometimes even within the same episode. The music and sound is acceptable. There are some momentsthat do actually come together well, but the series as a whole feels insanely rushed and consistent in both storytelling and overall production, so those moments end just being reminders of the kind of series Grancrest could have been.\\n\\n\r\nI won't say this one was a trainwreck, as I did still enjoy it a bit, but I cannot forgive A-1 for wasting so much potential.

            "content": "Grancrest isn\u00b4t a show best watched an episode per week. It\u2019s way too many things going on at the same time, and important parts lacks explanation along the way. Which is why I half way in the show stopped and saved up most episodes left. Watched like that it wasn\u00b4t as bad as it first had appeared. \r\nDoes Grancrest Senki (Record of Grancrest War) has its notable issues? Absolutely. The pacing is, if not off, very uneven. Character exploration and development is forsaken for hasty strategy and battles (think Game of Thrones S7), and the number of difficult names of characters thrown back and forthis sometimes staggering. \\n\\n\r\nYes, it\u2019s very generic, and the narrative isn\u00b4t what I prefer in storytelling. But it did however, have its moments and showed some great potential, hence the relatively high score. I have no experience with the source material (Grancrest is an LN adaptation by Miyuu (Art), Mizuno, Ryou (Story), which was released in 10 volumes between 2013 and 2018). So, if this is a good adaptation or not, I can`t tell. So, this review is based on the anime alone.\\n\\n\r\nA pretty common (and agreeing) opinion seems to be that the narrative is horrible. And it is certainly something else. A certain scene could go on for a whole episode, for the next throwing like three different battles against gods know who, because there where so many characters, with all sorts of fancy names. Just to get a hang on who\u00b4s with the Alliance, and who\u00b4s with the Union (and what they even represent), or where the hell all of this is supposed to happen - is quite hard to follow. So just a few episodes here and there was just confusing, this needs to be bench watched or maybe not at all. They do mention their connections in conversations quite often, its just so many, and pitch the name with a face failed quite often (at least for me). \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not just the pacing that\u2019s is a bit off, the content could also feel misplaced. I would\u00b4ve liked some more focus on the personal sides of the characters and the world building, and maybe less on strategy meetings and rushed battles. Because I had a lot of questions that never got satisfying answers. Like, what is chaos and how does they use it for magic? A very fundamental rock in the world building, which was just touched briefly. You just kind of had to accept the powers the characters had was there to be there. Some things are explained later, just don\u00b4t expect it to be in great detail. Many important plot points also have to be guessed or assumed, which may put watchers off.\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of characters also, besides being confusingly many, robs time from character developments. Because there are some interesting characters that just should\u00b4ve have gotten more time. And here we get to one of the main problems the show seems to have \u2013 Theo as the main character. I get why many have a problem with him as the clear \u201cstar\u201d of the show. He\u00b4s got very little personality and background in the beginning (read none), and everyone around him just instantly admired him. It was annoying. All he did was looking pretty and say a few generic words, and people would follow him to war in a second. He gets a little better throughout the show, he gets some personality and does his fair share of dirty work. But he is the generic hero in the flesh all the way through. So, much time that went to making him even more heroic could\u00b4ve gone to much more interesting characters such as Aishela, Irvin, the count of Villar, Siluca or Marrine. Like how did Irvin end up a very loyal personal bodyguard to Siluca? How did he become such a great killer? How ended Siluca up being adopted? How did Marrine get know what she knew? No elaboration.\\n\\n\r\nBecause here Grancrest is a bit two pieced, the characters are both its strong hold and its weakness. The negative would be the amount of characters and maybe Theo as the main character, and the positive would be some of the other characters, mostly those mentioned before. They had so much potential to be really great but was unfortunately thrown to the side. \\n\\n\r\nGrancrest is an A-1 Pictures production and if you are familiar with the studio, you probably know what to expect, it\u2019s their standard. So-so CGI, the art looks good in close ups, little sloppy in larger format, dramatic and colourful costumes, curvy ladies and muscly men. What really surprised me while watching this though, are that they seem to have had a damn good fight director. I\u00b4m not talking about the big battles (those could be pretty boring), but the more close and personal fights. Great knife battles with some nice martial arts, sword and magic fights \u2013 the guy definitely got some skills. Aishela\u00b4s rampages with her spear, Irvin\u00b4s knife duels, and Siluca\u00b4s confrontations with the black witch, was the highlights of this show, truly. Even Theo have some good moments later on. \\n\\n\r\nGrancrest is falling within my favourite genres and does some of it pretty decent. I love fantasy\u00b4s especially with some good action, drama and romance in the mix. The fantasy was definitely there, but I miss the world building. Chaos, demons, crests, the Empire, the Mage Academy - how does it work and how are they connected? Interesting concepts that never fully got explored, just a bit rushed towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nBut besides all my whining, I mostly enjoyed the show. It\u00b4s generic alright, but it does walk a little bloodier path than your normal shounen. Mirza is much like old warlords most have been, all from the pride to the blood thirst. Marrine is a good example to answer the question; \u201cHow many people are you prepared to let die for the one you love?\u201d. Those two lets much blood flow. It had some slices and dices of romance, which in my book is a good thing. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Grancrest wasn\u00b4t a bad show, its just horrible to watch on weekly basis. As I mentioned before, this is a show best benched watched, or maybe not watched at all. I\u00b4m glad that I saved up the second part of the show and benched it. I can see how Grancrest won\u00b4t be for everyone (shows seldom are), but if you just can live with the flaws and like the genres, it has some really good moments. I got the feeling \u201cThis is why I watch anime\u201d at least a few times. And I recommend you to watch \u201cThe Legend of Legendary Heroes\u201d if you already haven\u00b4t watched it. Generic title aside, that show does what Grancrest does but mostly better.\\n",

            "content": "I'll be honest right off the bat. This show is super generic. But that isn't always a bad thing. Yes it's bland in a way. But if you like a straight up fantasy show, then this is it. That's exactly what I was looking for going in, and mostly, I wasn't let down. Gonna break this up by each of the categories used by MAL when rating these things. \r\nStory: probably it's weakest feature tbh. It's not very original. It's kinda bland. It's got some really uneven pacing. Feels stretched in some spots and feels dragged in others. The overall plot is fairly easy tounderstand. Young guy wants to save his home land but get swept up in something bigger than just that. Been there done that. Pretty basic. But ya know what, despite that, it's got some charm to it. It's kinda meh on story but it's easy going nature makes it an easy show in and of itself. 6.\\n\\n\r\nArt: nothing too special. There were some definite highlights in there, episode 17 kicked so much ass!! But mostly it was serviceable at best. Again, kinda meh for the most part. Not much to say on it really. 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound: probably it's best feature. Speaking on the openings and endings, they were all really good. Not best of season good, but pretty good none the less. The OST is amazing though. Like they use some awesome orchestral music and one track in particular stood out to me and something special. The sound design too was great. The effects in all the battle scenes were always on point. Voice acting too, whomever played Theo sounded great. 9.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: again, common theme too, kinda meh. Some better than others or course but a pretty mixed bag. With the story being so lackluster the characters suffer from that a lot. Theo himself was a good lead, basic and cookie cutter as he was, he still made me respect his beliefs and his determination. Siluca was a good foil for him. She took the lead for most of the first half if the show. While Theo was still learning how to geopolitics. The rest of the cast was alright I suppose. They did their job well enough. The major \"villain\" for a lot of the show was really cool though, as I said before, episode 17 was amazing and the whole arc with Milza vs Theo from about episodes 12-27 was incredible to see. At least the parts of them interacting. 7.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: ya know, despite all the lackluster things with this show. I can't say I didn't have a good time honestly. All these people ragging on it even though they watched it all, supposedly, make no sense to me cause it's a long show and you're just wasting time at that point and that's on you. But anyways, I had a genuine amount of fun with this show. I always wanted more. It always did at least enough to keep me coming back. 8.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: despite its basic as hell plot and it's mostly dull characters and it's wonky, uneven writing. I still enjoyed this show a lot. It's a by the books fantasy through and through. Doesn't break the mold in any way whatsoever. But it's still a fun time and does enough. I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. The ending too was very sweet and pretty perfect. 8/10.",

I'm here to tell you about one of the primary themes throughout the story and how it is so poorly handled as to be intellectually offensive.\r\nTwo of the supporting characters are originally supposed to be married but a calamity occurs, creating a schism between the two dominant factions of the continent and also two star-crossed lovers.\r\nThe male, Alexis wants desperately to be with his fiancee, however she has decided that the only way to rid the world of chaos is to unite the titular Grancrest byusing military might to subjugate the rest of the lords and forcibly take their crests from them. \\n\\n\r\nThe result is a ridiculous dichotomy in which Marinne, the fiancee is waging war and slaughtering the army / citizens / leaders of all the neighbouring states, all the while being portrayed as a victim of circumstance who \"deserves to be with the one she loves\", according to the protagonist and just about everyone else (but her).\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show is another huge issue, it takes about 18 episodes to get to a point in the story which are then undone in the following 2 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult to imagine why the writers of the show thought they could get away with setting up a dictator character who commits war crimes, kills her own family members for their crests, and causes the deaths of tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of people as someone who we should root for as a love interest.\\n\\n\r\nits absurd on a level I can barely comprehend.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise this is a generic anime thats fairly forgettable and really luls at certain points in the story, but its mediocre status is further lowered by the ludicrous love story.\\n\\n\r\nPlease reconsider whether you want to watch this, you could find much better things to watch.",

I really think this anime is great!\r\n*SPOILERS*\r\nI see a lot of people complaining about episode 9 of the anime where marrine had sex with mirza. I want you all to get something through your heads, this is an anime about war and conquest for territory/power.\r\nFor the characters wanting to have more of this ANYTHING is possible. The reason WHY they have sex and i see that many of those bad reviews ofepisode 9 don't even mention it, is because Marrine (leader of the Aliance faction) bargains with Mirza (who was helping the leader of the Union faction at the time, and this guy is the god of war in this anime) to help her out. \\n\\n\r\nMirza... a man in the end, with HUMAN desires, decides that for him to help marrine and betray the union, he just wanted sex with a beautiful blonde woman. This, my friends, in war... to achieve someone's help and to bargain for something asking for sex is not bad, very much less if it's with the leader of a faction. It's very good actually in my opinion, i was NOT expecting to see something like that in the anime so i was surprised in a good way. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, unless you guys want a 100 episode anime explaining the background of every character that we have already seen in the anime (there are many, many characters) you shouldn't be complaining about it being fast paced. In the beginning it was weird because we didn't have that much background information about the anime itself or the characters... but then it just became normal and understanding taking into account the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to see a WAR/CONQUEST anime with lots of background information and lots of episode, you can go watch Kingdom... i recommend this as another great war anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall grancrest has a weird start and that is the only reason why i'm not giving it a 10, but besides that... once you get understanding what the anime is about around episode 3 i would say... it's very good and throughout the season, each episode just keeps getting better and better. Episode 9 was a masterpiece, watching the sex scene, knowing marrine didn't really want it, but had to do it to get the upperhand in the war was just top notch. Theo has his ways with words and Siluca saw potential in him.\\n\\n\r\nI do believe this anime needs to have a better score and it's underrated.",

The first few episodes were also quite good with how Theo managed to progress on his rank. But after episode 4 or 5, everything seemed to slow down a tad too much, which destroyed the consistency of the anime. After watching episodes 7 and 8, enough was enough for me. I mean, if you started the anime with a fast start you better keep it consistent. or at least don't make it slow down to a snail's pace. It's like the producers just want to makethe episodes for the sake of making the episodes and to drag the whole anime. For what?! From the way I see it, this anime could be competed within like 12-15 episodes, yet it's 24 episodes?! Really a disappointment for an anime that could've been great. The art is good, sound is decent, characters decent but when it came to the storyline, it is a total letdown!",

In short the man behind one of my favourite shows of my youth, Record of Lodoss War. And while it had some really interesting Game of Thrones esque political content in its first half which made me anticipate each new episode, with some extremely nerve wracking cliffhangers, in tandem with the shows extreme decline of animation budget within its last third, the writing sadly lost a lot of steam once the initial conflict was resolved leading to a ratherrushed ending with pretty poor writing.\\n\\n\r\nCome to speak of the animation budget: While it was undeniably one of the prettier shows this year in it's first season/half, the animation went from amazing to downright borderline garbage in the last arc. What went wrong? This started as a really beautifully animated A1 pictures anime and then they ran out of budget it seems. It's the 90s all over again. That something as drastic would happen nowadays and to A1 pictures nonetheless... I'm shocked.\\n\\n\r\nEither way, the anime was enjoyable, though I found the complex political stuff in the mid part and all the edgy content exponentially more intriguing than the borderline fantasy cliche elements in the last third or so. Generally the show went from interesting political intrigue that would rival the best moments of Game of Thrones to action shounen episodes to generic 80s high fantasy. Very weird direction it took there. But I can totally see Ryo Mizuno's handwriting here, this really felt like a spiritual successor to Record of Lodoss War in quite some ways. That alone made it worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\n7/10",

            "content": "The story pleased me. By having a lot of talk about \"military strategies\" and relatively little action, the anime is easy to \"drop\"; but for those who do not mind understanding a bit about the universe of the characters, these endless conversations are no big deal.\r\nThe protagonist Theo does not look anything like the stereotype of male protagonism. Theo is determined, acerbic, knows what he wants and does not mind losing one thing to win another. His idealism might well lead the character to the stereotype of the good revolutionary, but it is a good thing that it does not.\r\nThe female protagonist Siluca is adorable,has personality and is driven by well-established goals. The fact that she saw Theo as a means of securing her purpose, without at the same time disrespecting it, is the kind of rare move in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe highlight for the other characters is the Princess Marrine; Because of it I will always remember that Grancrest Senki as the anime of the princess who has committed prostitution to try to win a war.",

But this anime is so underrated and getting bashed much more than it needs to be. At one point MAL score wasn't even in the sevens (7) (WITH TL;DR at the end)\r\nOkay so let's get into the actual review:\r\n-Story (8/10) - The story is fun and enjoyable, quite unique too.  The story is built around possessing a power known as creed or in other words lord's power. (Itsignifies nobility and gives superhuman powers) With the goal in mind to become an emperor and gain the power to get rid of chaos and let the world be free from it. Everything is achieved through ploys, battles and various strategies.\\n\\n\r\n*pros: fun and exciting to watch;\\n\\n\r\n*cons: can be hard to understand what's happening especially for newer anime watchers;\\n\\n\r\n-Art (7.5) - The art was somewhat inconsistent. Sometimes it was really good and sometimes it could have been better. But it was definitely good enough for me to like it.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters (8/10) - I actually enjoyed a lot of characters in this show. They all have their own specific purpose. There were characters that I hated and there were characters that I loved and rooted for. And all that symbolizes that they were fairly well written and balanced. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound (8/10) - Soundtracks were quite enjoyable for me and gave me that war/battles/fantasy vibe that I crave so much. But this is obviously very subjective and I am no sound expert by any means.\\n\\n\r\n-My personal enjoyment (9/10) - For me this anime was a blast to watch. Mostly because I am someone who really enjoys this genre. \\n\r\nAnd it's truly underrated mostly because of \"fast pacing\" But let me say this. A lot of people on every episode of this anime likes to constantly cry and cry that it was rushed... so from my understanding you would rather have unfinished anime with no ending and probably never getting a sequel like happens with most of the anime's nowadays. Or would you rather have somewhat rushed but with an actual satisfying ending. To all their own I guess. Plus people were really salty about NTR. But ffs it's a war anime and FANTASY at that. People were doing all they could to succeed. Just take this with a grain of salt. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10) -  TL;DR | I personally really enjoyed this anime and I am glad that I gave it a chance. It had its ups and downs but in the end I had a blast watching it. I don't regret watching it one bit. And for the people who can't follow \"fast pace\" work on yourself because it wasn't that bad and certainly not every episode was \"fast paced\" everything was perfectly understandable. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

People who you'd think would have a bigger roles towards the end seem to disappear. And everything becomes about not hurting others. \r\nI still very much enjoyed watching it even though the ending was a let down.

            "content": "I think that the main reason why I dislike the show was because I set my expectations too high. \r\nWhat I expected was a deep, introspective show about military combat with the assistance of magical entities, akin to something like Tales of Zestiria, or FMA. Instead, what I got was a major disappointment, which I can sum up entirely in Episode 3's \"battle\".\r\nOutnumbered and outgunned, our heroes attempt to fight against a vastly superior army. They are up against trained soldiers, all of whom boast (presumably) steel armor. However, they are \"luckily\" joined by a handful of villagers with close to no military training, andhave a small army of their own. (The other lords join them too, but they had no way of knowing that.)\\n\\n\r\nThis is a perfect chance for our heroes to show off their brilliant strategy of...\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharging directly into a better armed numerically superior force. Great.\\n\\n\r\nIgnoring \"MAGIC!!!\", critical mistakes I noted were:\\n\r\n1. During the initial charge, the hero's army lacks both shields and lower torso armor, and yet fail to even try to guard their incredibly exposed bodies\\n\r\n2. In a single scene, Theo's sword isn't able to cut the shield, but CAN cut through steel.\\n\r\n3. Humans ran as fast as horses.\\n\r\n4. A hammer too heavy for anyone to possibly hold knocks off someone's head.\\n\r\n5. A line of F***ING CROSSBOWS penetrates STEEL ARMOR. THEY'RE NOT EVEN MAGIC. THOSE ARE JUST CROSSBOWS!\\n\\n\r\nThis basically becomes the entire show. Theo and crew do something ridiculously stupid that shouldn't work, it does work, and everyone treats Theo like he's a goddamn genius. It's worse than making a Kirito. Kirito at least has a believable excuse: Some gamers are hardcore as f***, and he got in on the early beta of a poorly designed game. But Theo is just an idiot. and it bothers me that he actually gets anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nMan, originally I gave this 4/10, but after actually articulating my thoughts, I might have to bring it down.",

            "content": "Honestly, everyone in this community hates on things for way too many reasons. I'm going to be honest on my opinion of shows and give them scores I believe them to deserve. Lets start with this one. \r\nAt first, I couldn't really get into the story since the first three episodes were kinda bland and unrelated, and then with acceleration in the middle of the season I got confused, however I still do enjoy the art and the characters, which truly are actually quite intriguing. \r\nI like the different types of themes in each warrior and how they differ as characters in the show. DespiteTheo getting a lot of hate for some reason or another, I honestly don't see the problem. \\n\r\nDon't know if its my taste or what, be seems like he has an honorable cause he wants to fight for, he likes his main girl who he and her have been through the show so far with, hes a talented but inexperienced fighter which generally is a good plot start as it progresses to show their shortcomings and adversity. I like his spirit and sure he is a little annoying because of his attitude and rather bland interactions, but I think he fits right into the story and where it should be following this young knight trying to weave light into the world, and his romance with Siluca is fast but I think it shows his conviction, and loyalty, as well as he enjoys her company and he appreciates her guidance, what more could there be in love?\\n\r\nNow lets talk about episode 9. Yes it was really strange scene and I think it definitely could have been portrait better, and with some more decency. However, I think that so far this show has been rather blunt, the blood and gore, foul mouthing, and sexuality in the story concludes that this show is for mature audiences despite its kawaii appeal with the teen love and cute characters, and I also think that this shows the darkness in the prince Milza, It definitely could have avoided the rapey feel tho. It was really weird and uncomfortable, not to mention confusing, but other than this horrible scene in the show, it is quite good and I will review it as so.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, or perhaps more precisely, details that may spoil the plot. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!\r\nLet me preface this by saying that I enjoyed the first Record of Lodoss War series, which was based on novels written by the same author. Yes, it took quite a few liberties with his work (the later TV series, I'm told, is a bit more faithful, if an inferior production in my opinion), but I contend that this series is the standard to which any fantasy anime should be held up to. The characters are rich and dynamic, the plot well-developed, all the scenes were edited withcare, and you could just tell the production team were great storytellers. So to say I had high hopes for this series would be an understatement.\\n\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures is a solid animation house, and I've enjoyed several series produced by them. Visually, the scenes are well-animated, the character designs are good, I don't recall any glaring errors or flaws. The soundtrack... honestly, I don't remember it. It's probably one of those soundtracks that stays in the background and supports the visuals. The voice acting is decent, and I don't remember hearing much in the way of typical Japanese overacting.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending... I'd say they're adequate. They felt like they belonged more in a 90s Gundam show than a fantasy anime. The opening feels like it's trying to force the rest of the production to \"begin the story\", which is fine for the first episode, but for 11 episodes? That got old, fast.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 9... Let me say that I still feel nauseous. If you're writing a suspense film, sure, that sort of thing is fine in the middle of the plot, but in the middle a 2-cour anime, at the end of an episode, no less, it just leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. Generally when you write this sort of scene, you do it near the end of a series-- think the laboratory scene in Eureka Seven, the revelation of child abuse in Fractale. The reason for this is, the show is then compelled to emotionally make it up to the audience-- say, the perpetrator is killed, or the victim is brought out of despair. The \"payback\", if you will, is slated for the end of the series. Sorry, I'm not willing to wait that long.\\n\\n\r\nBut you know what? I'll get over this. I got over Gundam SEED Destiny, I got over School Days, I got over Eureka Seven AO, all shows I anticipated and all that let me down violently. In my opinion this production belongs in the dustbin with those other failures.\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, on to the real weaknesses of the show. The first major weakness is the planning of the series. Ten light novel volumes is a LOT of content to cover in 24 episodes, and just to give you a comparison, Hyouka animated just over 4 volumes in 22 episodes. This reeks of a demand on the part of the studios or publisher to tell the entire story in half a year rather than 3 cours or 4. This forces the story to be either nonstop action (like the theatrical cut of The Two Towers), or a parade of non sequiturs that have to be explained in a summary episode. This isn't refreshing or new, it's sloppy storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization suffers also from the condensed schedule. For example, in the manga, you see a (too long, but setting that aside) flashback of Aishela and Siluca with their adoptive father. That doesn't exist in the anime, and had it existed, it really would've brought home the pain and fear Siluca experienced at that moment in the series. In the anime, unfortunately, Aishela and Siluca are old and close friends because we said so, get used to it, on to the next battle! You're not given any time to get to know the characters because it's not important enough to the series creators.\\n\\n\r\nThe second major weakness of the show is the lack of theme. For those of you who haven't survived high school English, the theme of a story is a message that the author is trying to say in a million words or so. Now, the setting is outstanding-- the novel author knows how to create a fantasy world, and it shows here just as well as in Lodoss War. But it seems to me like he's much more of a DND DM than a seasoned novelist-- it seems to me like the theme just doesn't matter, at least in the first half of the series. That does two things: First, it leaves the plot in a quagmire (giggity), unable or unwilling to provide the audience any emotional or rational direction. Second, it reduces the show to a shallow series of beautifully animated scenes that ultimately do not matter. I feel that anyone who writes this way insults the intelligence of his audience, and frankly, whoever edited and wrote the scenario, while thinking that animating a creepy coerced sex scene all the way up to penetration is important should be ashamed of themselves.\\n\\n\r\nI'm also not a huge fan of removing the main characters from the focus of the story for more than one episode, because it makes it seem as though they don't exist during that time. The battles in episode 10 could've been condensed and a reaction scene given to Theo even for just 20 seconds. He is the main character, right? Instead there's a brief mention of his exploits in dialogue only. Seriously?\\n\\n\r\nI've long held that it's a bad idea in the anime industry to release a summary episode (the only thing that's worse is halting production and delaying broadcast). If you cannot tell the story in the main episodes sufficiently well that you need a summary episode to do the storytelling for you by a narrator, that is a red flag to me, and whether the episode is planned or not is irrelevant. The reason for this is, they could have slowed the pace down and took more time with telling the story, one episode's worth, instead of rushing for 11 episodes and give an \"instant replay\" the 12th week. As they say in film, \"Don't tell the story, show it!\" Again, the condensation of the light novel content proves a serious weakness. What, are they going to release a second summary episode after the finale, for those who couldn't keep up with the second half?\\n\\n\r\nApologies for the long review/rant, and if you've read this far, thank you for sticking through it.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap up:\\n\r\n- Good visuals and concept; the author of Lodoss War certainly knows how to craft a fantasy world.\\n\r\n- The 2-cour schedule for the entire series of novels forces the production staff to cut too much content; character developing scenes and background scenes are largely dropped in favor of action and combat, and inadequate storytelling in the main episodes compel the use of a summary episode. The adaptation would have been better served with a full year's worth of episodes, though honestly I don't know if I still would've watched it.\\n\r\n- The introduction of sex scenes is abrupt and borderline manipulative (to me, at least), and along with gratuitous violence and death makes the series appear like a cheaper rushed copy of Game of Thrones.\\n\\n\r\nIn a word, disappointing. I should've stayed away.",

            "content": "Look at all the reviews before mine and you'll see a lot of poor ratings. Well, my rating is going to be double the mode of the ratings given thus far (the mode is 3).\r\nStory: 6\r\nArt: 6\r\nSound: 5\r\nCharacter: 7\r\nEnjoyment: 6 \r\nOverall: 6\r\nTL;DR: I would recommend everyone who gets disappointed by the lack of explanation in \r\nthis anime to watch the recap episode (11.5). This episode totally changed my perception and doubled my rating for this show. Can you believe it?\r\nSPOILERS and LOTS OF WORDS abound. Read at your own risk.\r\nStory:\r\nThe pacing is unique at best and terrible at worst. The anime teases you about agreat plot (war in a fantasy world!) and then disappoints you with its direction.\\n\r\nThe first few minutes were what hooked me. With the introduction of Siluca (almost like she was a secret agent), I thought she was destined to be the focus of the anime. However, I was soon wholly disappointed.\\n\r\nThe plot then progressed so quickly before I could even get my head around the setting, factions, characters and their motivations. Skirmishes took place and characters died before I could understand why they had to. New characters were introduced and before I could get to know them, more arrived. This is especially tiring for an introvert such as I.\\n\r\nThen came episode 9. I was speechless at the last scene for that episode, not because of its dark contents, but because I didn't understand why it had to occur. Basically, Marrine who was in love with Alexis allowed herself to be conquered (for lack of a better euphemism) by Milza. The conquest itself didn't creep me out; Milza (that sadist...) simply wanted to confirm that Marrine had the resolve to do whatever it takes to unite the continent. No, what crept me out was why Marrine chose to betray Alexis. I decided to take a break from this show, returning only yesterday.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was fair. I've seen better, and I've seen worse. This show fits in around the middle. Enough said, for such an introvert as I am.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music... It sounds good, but I can't remember any of it. As for the other sound effects, they didn't have any particular effect on me, so they're all mediocre, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nNow, episode 11.5 is the best episode in this anime. It reveals to you what all the previous 11 episodes are all about. Suddenly, all the doubts I had about the plot, setting, characters and characters' motivations disappeared. (So that's why Marrine did that!) However, there are still some things I couldn't understand, like how family members could meet in goodwill before a battle and then proceed to kill one another in battle. That's like joking around with your brother/sister one minute and then fighting each other to the death the next. It could just be one of the social constructs in the anime. I have no clue.\\n\r\nIn any case, the romance between Villar and Margaret is the best! Even after episode 11...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe first 11 episodes of the anime are a total waste of time, to be honest. The pacing, the uncertainty about the plot, etc., killed any anticipation I previously had for the show (namely war in a fantasy world!). But the recap episode rejuvenated me, so I now look forward to the rest of the anime!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall, I give a 6 because that's the mean of the sum of the five component ratings.",

So, quick background, Marine is in love with another man (Alexis) and her feelings are reciprocated! Therefore, watching her consent to having sex with Milza like it's nothing is fucking torture to my eyes and mind! I mean, are you fucking kidding me?! Seriously?! Marine couldn'tmake a better choice?! Besides, it's soooooooooooooo fuckin' out of the blue that it just pisses you off! She gives her virginity to a guy she doesn't even love for what? Loyalty? Which she isn't even sure that Milza will uphold after the deed! GIVE ME A BREAK! I WAS HOPING FOR HER TO BE WITH ALEXIS! Also, this was meant to be a PURE romance anime! Not some anime about the grotesque exploitation of women! The last scene was just fuckin' disturbing! It's been 2 hours since I watched the scene and I'm still fuckin' pissed!

            "content": "GRANCREST SENKI -  HALFWAY REVIEW\r\nOh, boy, this series. This was one most anticipated animes this season because I love a story that goes deep into politics, philosophy, and morals. Stories about characters who either fighting for what they believe in and/or their country but also might be struggling with themselves while also struggling to figure what is truly right and what is truly wrong.\r\nThis anime had all the potential to be just that, but from the very beginning it has struggled to maintain a proper flow. What's worse, there was honestly no reason for it to be like that. As of now, this animehas made me more appreciative of A-1 product that everyone else hated. And I'm probably going to piss some people when I bring up that one anime so I ask you to please bear with me when I do bring it up.\\n\\n\r\nSIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND\\n\r\nThe premise of this anime is simple enough to understand, especially if you're long time fan of fantasy novels. Medieval/Renaissance fantasy setting, complete with magic, creatures, castles, and battles. Those who hold a title do not posses their through a magic sword, but instead a magic crest, hence the title. Naturally, wars are fought over these crests in addition to everything else that goes along with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe series take on politics well done for the most part. Some people have called Grancrest the \"Game of Thrones\" anime and it pretty much is except without all the sex and nudity, for the most. For me though, this anime reminds me more of Tad Williams Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy which I read back in high school. You have characters here who are caught up in a war that's being fought for the wrong reasons yet they have no choice but to see it through.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this has the making for a good fantasy epic... except there's ONE major problem. THE PACING.\\n\\n\r\nDIFFICULT TO FOLLOW\\n\r\nThe pacing of this anime is all over the place, and it is what's killing this show right now. And what's worse, there's no fucking reason for it! Right from the start the show just rushes to get the next battle or the next political talk or whatever without ever slowing down! If this was twelve episode one cour anime then yeah, I could understand why they would do that because they would have so much to tell yet little time to do it. But since this is a twenty-four episode series, they have plenty of time to tell the story properly! But they're not!Iin the end you're left asking yourself: Why? Why are they rushing so much when they don't need to?!\\n\\n\r\nNow I know some of you are going to be saying, \"It's A-1 Pictures, DirectorK. What do you expect? They always botch things up and that's why they suck.\" I'd be inclined to agree to you, but... I have two reasons not to.\\n\\n\r\nOne, A-1 Pictures is not the only anime studio out there who have made mistakes like this. Every studio out there, young and old, anime and Hollywood, have had their own fair share of hits and misses. So in the end, it would be cheap of me to blame it all the studio just because everyone else hates it for whatever reason.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, as much I agree with the people who bitched about The Asterisk War, another one of A-1's light novel adaptations, if there's one thing the studio did right with that show it was the pacing. Now don't get get me wrong, TAW does have a shit ton of problems, but at least the studio handled the story's pacing surprisingly well. A-1 actually went out of their way to tell the story properly despite the generic tropes and cliches. In other words, TAW was easy to care about if your really tried and ignore all of its problems, unlike this show which leads me to my next point.\\n\\n\r\nDIFFICULT TO CARE ABOUT\\n\r\nIn a story that is as big, deep, and powerful as this one, you need to have characters that you can care about and follow from start to finish. Unfortunately though, because of the botched pacing it's damn near impossible to care about any of the main characters. Why? Because they're never given the time to develop properly because the anime is more focused on other things getting through them as fast as it can. And any characters you do manage to care about either disappear after a time, possibly never to appear again, or they die.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters aren't any better. They only serve the purpose of moving the story along in rushed manner, making you wonder why they even put them there in the first place. Then you have the characters you really couldn't give two shits about or just outright hate when they start making stupid decisions. And since I'm on that subject, I might as well bring up what between Marrine and Mirza at the end of episode nine. If you've been following this series you know what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nBEGIN RANT\\n\r\nNow I understand why people were disturbed and outright hated that scene, but you need to remember what time period this story is set in because this kind of thing happened quite a lot. Hell, what do you think Game of Thrones is all about? That kind of thing happens almost every season! If you're a GOT fan you should be used to this sort of thing by now.\\n\\n\r\nIn Marrine's case, I understand why she did what did. After seeing what Mirza could do in battle she would rather have him as an ally than an enemy. As a leader of a nation, it is her responsibility to care both her people and her soldiers. And that requires making difficult decisions. However, with all that being said, what Marrine did there was just plain... STUPID.\\n\\n\r\nNow again, I understand why she did it, but I find really hard to believe that a woman of her stature would lower herself to that level. If would have made more sense if she had been forced into that situation or if Mirza had approached her instead of the other way around. What's worse, is that she doesn't even take the time to think it over! She just immediately goes along with Mirza's proposal as though she's done this sort of thing before! Like seriously, come on!\\n\\n\r\nI honestly have to give Mirza credit for not only going through with it, but also keeping a straight face when she agreed right away without hesitation. If it were me, I probably would have burst out laughing and said, \"No, sorry. You're not worth it. Thanks for the offer though!\" and left. I say that because it was very clear that Mirza was only testing her and that he wasn't being serious. I honestly don't what he was trying to gain out of that, other than the obvious, but seeing how he's suppose to represent the Arab culture of this world... well, I think we all know just how badly women can be treated in that part of the world.\\n\\n\r\nI was actually aware of this scene before that episode aired and I was hoping they would change it but even that was too much to ask. it wasn't act itself that disgusted me it was the fact that it made Marrine look so pathetically weak! Both as leader and as character! All she had to do was to say no and to stand her ground because Mirza probably would have joined her anyway. Then again, maybe that was the entire purpose of that scene. It was designed to show just how much of a coward Marrine truly is and that she'd been waging a pointless was from the start.\\n\r\nEND RANT\\n\\n\r\nSo, getting that little rant out of the way, I'm going to bring up The Asterisk War again in comparison to the characters of this show. Despite the characters being the typical tropes, as you would expect out of a harem anime, TAW managed to make the characters likable in a way that you could get behind and follow them because they were given proper character development.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, when you have one anime that is generic while the other isn't yet has better pacing and character development than the other, you know something's wrong. And it's a damn shame because I really want to like these characters but so far this anime hasn't given me a reason to.\\n\\n\r\nWHERE TO GO FROM HERE\\n\r\nThe pacing needs to slow down and the characters need to be developed more. Grancrest Senki has gotten off to a really rough start and that needs to change through the second half if it wants make any significant impact. However, I am worried that since they rushed through so much the studio may not have enough material to get through another twelve episodes and that may forced to put in some pointless filler. The show still has potential, but it's going to be really interesting to see how A-1 handles it from here.\\n\\n\r\nI'm DirectorK and until next time, stay tuned!",

Currently 15/24 episodes\r\nWhat this show does well:\r\nThere are \"hero\" characters; and there are A LOT of no-face characters. People are killed (permadeath); there's blood. Characters are named, and are significant. This means the MC and his buddies, and the BBEG(?) and friends can go to town. There are a lot of battle scenes.\r\nThe best parts of lordship are established early (power, wealth, influence, making girls wear skimpy uniforms). Shittier parts of lordship work their way into the storyline. This show doesn't hide it, or mask it. It's likeGame of Thrones, with less tits and more (faster) plot.\\n\\n\r\nFan service in this show almost seems like it is not a priority, which is nice. Character design is generally well made. There's some romance, but it feels very appropriate (actually, \"interjected\" would be a better word - very much like a FE support convo happening in the middle of a world war).\\n\\n\r\nWhat this show does poorly:\\n\r\nThe time skips are a bit too casual. Not complaining too much about the pacing, because many-times it works out positively; however, the transitions are often not so smooth.\\n\\n\r\nAfter ep6(?) there seem to be a lot of names to keep track of. Sometimes this gets confusing (watching with English subs) and I wish there was a small portrait of the person next to the name.\\n\\n\r\nThe aerial-view art is obviously 3D graphics with no movement (not even some shitty perline movement applied to arms and knees). It's minor, but was noticeable to me.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's a decent anime, I'd say slightly better than average. I find it rather enjoyable. I can understand some people's complaints about it, but so far I feel like finishing off this season, at the very least. Again, at time of this review 15/24 episodes watched.",

I've enjoyed similar anime like Arslan Senki and 12 Nations, so I thought I'd give this one a chance despite its low MAL rating.  I need not have bothered.\r\nIn actual execution, it is terrible.  The writers don't seem to know the first thing about politics, economics, or military strategy.  The battles are hilariously devoid of actual tactics and the political decisions made by the major players seem like those of petulant middle school students rather than leaders of nations.  Although, since mynation elected Trump, I suppose it's not THAT unrealistic...\\n\\n\r\nSorry, I got a little distracted there.  I tried to enjoy it for its romantic elements, but the decisions made by the Marrine character are also painfully unrealistic.  She and many of the other characters seem only able to act out of ego and pride without much intellect, wit, or critical thinking.  She claims to love Alexis but decides that the Grand Hall tragedy means their respective factions should return to war and therefore keep them apart.  Um... what?  Why not gang up on the actual parties responsible for the incident?  Instead of opening a criminal investigation and fighting back against the real culprits lets... give them what they want?  \\n\\n\r\nThat seems to be the extent of the strategic planning between factions in this anime.  They decide constantly to simply give the other factions what they want and allow themselves to be maneuvered for the dumbest of personal reasons.  Villar Constance, for example, refuses the leadership of the Union faction because \"grandfather wouldn't want his grandchildren to fight.\"  And yet, by refusing to take the offensive, he sets up that exact situation where he and Marrine face each other across the batttlefield anyway.  Then, when his castle is under siege, instead of taking the defensive advantage he decides to sally forth in a 2 person suicide rush.  Could they not have held the causeway leading to the castle indefinitely with only a few troops?  Could they not have built siege engines?  Hilariously, later in the series the other side talks about how they have the defensive advantage and should just sit tight in that very same castle!  So why would Villar, supposedly renowned for his strategic advisers, not do the same?  None of it makes much sense.\\n\\n\r\nI understand what the writers were going for, but it has the feel of work done by people who watched a fictional political drama once and thought they could write one too.  Meanwhile, they conducted zero research and employed no common sense.  It's so outlandishly juvenile and insulting to viewers that it ruined all other good parts for me.  I feel like I am a generous reviewer and even I had difficulty watching this.\\n\\n\r\nAvoid.",

Within 24 episodes, you tell everything, starting with the humble beginnings, where a young and talented mage girl meets a lowly hedge knight and forms a partnership with him, all along to the ultimate end, where they unify all people, become the emperors of the whole world, end the bloody wars, terminate the dark forces, and take an early retirement to withdraw to their chateau and become whine makers. A lot of story that is, and consequently the story is rushing along much more than anything you would expect from aTV show. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are able to go along with this pace, if you accept that there is not much time for character studies or extensive discussion of tactics and strategies, you get an entertaining fantasy story with a number of ups (and rather few downs, as there aren\u2019t really many setbacks for our protagonists). Foes become friends, allies become traitors, Prince Charming with the golden locks finally demonstrates his skills as a warlord, and there is a \u201cmerrily ever after\u201d for all (I don\u2019t think this is a spoiler for anybody, right?)   \\n\\n\r\nOkay, much more, so much more could have been done with this very unique relationship formed between our heroes, the young woman with great magical talent and even bigger political skills, and the idealistic knight who more than once appears somewhat overwhelmed by the sheer force of this woman who decided to support and even love him. But, hey, you get a cute talking cat (black, of course), and a viking king dying in a battle scene bloodier than the entire Elfen Lied. This should \u2013 and I really don\u2019t mean this in a condescending way \u2013 be more appealing to most anime lovers anyway, right?  \\n",

About the only thing it has when it starts is decent animation and the premise isn't an overly complicated mess like virtually every other modern-ish series. However it spirals wildly out of control the longer it goes on in multiple ways, which is something that some of these aspects couldn't afford in the first place.\r\nStory 3/10: As stated the story is simple at the start. Basically everything past the starting premises is a complete mess of wannabe politics and laughably poor attempts at portraying combat/war. The MC also has his generic Main-Character\u2122 cheesiness, andhis love-interest is apparently the most powerful mage in the setting... of course. It should also be noted that the \"goodguys\" frequently sperg about their noble intentions and the sacrifices they've made to accomplish them. However they make far less \"sacrifices\" than the supposed badguys because they are layered in plot-armour.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was also just plain terrible. You know those shows that build everything up only to poorly resolve it, but you notice a few episodes are left? Well it decided to try and do some \"meta\" stuff that only made me hate the MC and his waifu even more than I already did.\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10: It starts out decent, but partway through the action scenes suddenly become a wannabe knockoff of Devilman-Crybaby, probably because it was popular and the generally potato artstyle was cheap to produce. CGI is also infrequently used and can be very distracting from how bad it can be.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10: Very average, maybe even bad at times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10: Everyone is a flat character with one defining personality trait and nothing else to them. This can make some side-characters good from limited screentime, but what makes them \"good\" can(and is) ruined with any effort to expand upon them. Literally everyone is just a stepping stone for the main \"duo\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10: Didn't especially enjoy any of this show other than a handful of characters. One of which died anti-climatically to the MC. One of which should have died twice, and they decided to try and \"expand\" upon their character thus ruining them. The last character literally just vanished altogether.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10: Would not recommend this unless you've watched basically everything else. Everything this show tried to have fell flat or outright failed.",

            "content": "No spoilers beyond Episode 1\u2014except that this anime sucks\r\nThe best way I can describe Grancrest is a shoujo version of Berserk with no memorable characters or success at world building. From start to finish this anime is a gigantic mess with few (if any) redeemable qualities. \r\nStory: Grancrest starts with a Romeo/Juliet style wedding between two rival kingdoms being violently interrupted by a 3rd party. This wedding would have meant world peace but now for laughably underdeveloped reasons, it cannot proceed. On the macroscale, this leads to hostilities between the kingdoms and allows the \u201cage of chaos\u201d to continue. We are then introduced to thetwo main protagonists Theo, a low ranking, wandering knight and Silucia, a novice mage in search of a worthy master. They form an eternal pact within 3 minutes of meeting one another and begin their quest for world domination.\\n\\n\r\nGrancrest tried to create a world full of intricate diplomacy, clever battlefield tactics/strategies, political intrigue, shifting alliances and high fantasy. And in another universe, it may have come close to Berserk or Code Geass or Game of fucking Thrones but alas it did not. The main problem is that the characters and the plot line were kinda---dumb. The conflicts were dumb and the solutions to said conflicts were dumb. Theo would get himself in a pickle where he\u2019d be outnumbered 100 to 1 and the brilliant solution was simply to just win. There\u2019s a city in your way that\u2019s ruled by an enemy lord? Just give an impassioned speech at the gates and get them to pledge their undying loyalty to you\u2014done deal.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I should mention is that this anime is bloody as hell. We\u2019re talking decapitations, spears to faces, burning etc. Soldiers\u2019 lives are worthless in Grancrest and they get slaughtered in droves\u2014hence the Berserk comparison above. This doesn\u2019t add maturity or gravity to Grancrest at all, instead it backfires. Imaging cutting between castle guards getting ruthlessly butchered and cutesy, blushing romance scenes between the MCs. It\u2019s a schizophrenic train wreck. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime relies on characters\u2019 stupid decisions, deus ex machina interventions and easy-to-fix misunderstandings to simultaneously prolong and resolve conflicts. It was very unsatisfying and failed to even answer some of the basic questions I had after episode 1 like how does magic work and what is a \u201ccrest\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend against watching this anime unless you feel like going on a brain cell safari.\\n",

            "content": "Edit from last drop, had to do it because mal's mod team acts in a weird way.\r\nWhat is going on with the pacing of this? Seriously, they are either going too fast or going too slow. First 3 episodes were slow without any discussion or any explanation of the events happening. Episode 4 comes out, everything starts going way too fast, nothing makes sense, there's no correlation nor coherence between each scene. As far as this went, the story was everywhere, with a touch of a generic show, but it's not a surprise.\r\nThis show is perfect for those who ask they want action in eachscene, because all we see is them having a war with barely to any explanation of what's going on. All of this accompanied with weird and sloppy main characters that can't make a single strategy for the sake of their objectives.\\n\\n\r\nThe art department is not good, but not bad either. For some reason, they are using way too much CGI for a 2d anime.  I understand they want to use cgi for large scale fights, but in this case they don't even try to hide it. The fights we see are just generic ones between knights and mages, althought most action scenes between the characters of interest were good. The design of the characters resemble the ones introduced in the novel, which is something remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nI had to torture myself for the sake of the review and watch up to episode 7, but couldn't handle it after that. They aren't doing anything with the story, just introducing new wars between factions, introducing new characters, they don't explain anything, there isn't a single backstory or any sign of development, this series has 24 episodes, but the way it's going every episode is going to be the same, and i'm not up for that. dropperino",

            "content": "Grancrest Senki is an adaptation of a fantasy novel and as the English name indicates it is mostly about war, fighting and conquering castles. As it usually is with LN adaptations, the makers of this anime did not manage to include all relevant material in order to fit the whole story into 24 episode. It is especially noticeable in the first couple of episodes when the story seems to jump a bit from time to time leaving the watchers confused. But that changes in later episodes and I did not have problems following the development of the story (especially who fights with whom and where).\r\nSincemany of the other reviewers gave this anime unexpectedly low rating, I was thinking that it would be good to show to potential watchers why they shouldn\u2019t skip this anime which is what my review is going to focus on. Because I see the average score of this anime (slightly over 7 at the moment) as fair and appropriate. Grancrest Senki is not a masterpiece. When it started airing, I did not expect many people to watch it because the synopsis did not promise anything especially original, the trailer looked average. After a few episodes, I was surprised to see how many people were still watching it. Grancrest definitely has its faults, but you\u2019re are going to love it anyway. It is one of those anime which are for some reason very enjoyable and capture your heart, so you\u2019re going to forgive its faults (unless you don\u2019t like this genre).\\n\\n\r\nGiven that it is action fantasy with lots of fights, there isn\u2019t much character development for other characters beside the main ones. Overall, there is a lot of characters and sometimes you might forget names of the less important ones, but on the other hand this is that kind of anime in which a character can appear for only 3 minutes and instantly becomes loved by everyone (king Solon for example). I personally liked even many of the \u201cevil\u201d characters who were hated by some viewers. Mirza Kuches is a very good antagonist, even his design clearly shows that he is the bad guy, and it may also be because of his design, the way he moves, the way he is drawn in each scene that I found him captivating (while wishing they will defeat him as soon as possible).\\n\\n\r\nBut now more to the two main characters. The young knight Theo gets thrown into the whole story by accident because he just happens to encounter the mage Siluca while she is attacked by some ruffians. After he saves her (even though she would be easily able to protect herself), she decides to choose him as her master (whether he wants it or not). Theo did not have any big ambitions, just to save his small island home country, so at the beginning Siluca is the one who makes decisions and pushes him through the ranks to gain influence. But what is important, both of them realize this and it is not like Theo stays on the sidelines like some incompetent harem king. On the contrary, he takes on the role of the protagonist and does it justice. Among the MC from similar anime, I really appreciated his calmness and I found him overall very likable. Speaking about Siluca and Theo, their romance was very refreshing, with no unnecessary drama, it fitted nicely with the story and was pleasantly straightforward without any of the two characters being oblivious to their feelings. \\n\\n\r\nTo not make this review too long, I would like to sum up everything by saying that Grancrest Senki is not a flawless anime, but at the same time is very enjoyable and I would definitely re-watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: 7,5/10\\n",

But the story is full of small pieces that made me go \"wow, I love this part, this is so cool/well written/poetic/emotional\". It always kept my full attention.\r\nMost characters have superhuman courage, which is perhaps not realistic but gives this show an epicfeel. The main character acts boldly and decisively in all sorts of situations.\\n\\n\r\nGrancrest Senki has many scenes that are cool and well put together, or visually interesting. The show director did a great job.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this if you're not the kind of viewer who goes out of their way to critique everything wrong with a show, but instead takes it easy and enjoys the good parts, because there's a lot of good stuff in this anime despite its flaws.\\n\\n\r\nMost negative reviewers for this anime have had the good aspects of the show go over their head and also found flaws where there aren't any (such as the pacing, it goes fast to keep the story focused on interesting events). This is why I made this review, to provide a different perspective.",

            "content": "The show starts pretty well but soon the problems start to arrive and you realize that the author was more interested in promoting a number of social messages as:\r\n1. A woman can cheat on you as a form of love towards you. Makes no sense but whatever\r\n2. Even the worse, evil woman in the world can have her happy ending just because\r\n3. When it comes to religion men evil, women good.\r\nNow to dive in the problems this show has:\r\n1. The motives of the person seen as the antagonist for most of the series are dumb and nonsensical but for some reason many seem to agree\r\n2.Most castles are actually palaces and severely lack defense\\n\r\n3. When conquering a castle raising its defense levels does not seem to be something people do in this universe\\n\r\n4. People do not understand how a seige works. Everyone just exists the palace and does frontal assault. The only good seige is towards the end and the seiged building is not even a castle/palace but a small city mainly housing an academy.\\n\r\n5. Shields and Armor are just like paper mache and matter not\\n\r\n6.There is almost no strategy in any attack, almost all do frontal attacks and apparently with the exception of Dartanians which apparently are some sort of super humans despite having no magic is all about numbers\\n\r\n7. a woman defeats multiple male opponents in combat AFTER LOSING HER ART\\n\r\n8. Many of their decisions are illogical and dumb\\n\r\n10. The author spends a great deal of time trying to make us feel sorry for the main antagonist despite making extremely dumb and nonsensical decisions that only made things worse\\n\r\n11. Inserting the Holy Grail crap from Dan Brown's novels\\n\r\n12. No combat is remotely interesting. Tactics like scorched earth, traps, skirmishes and guerilla tactics which have been used in history are never used\\n\r\n13. The whole idea of needing an emperor is foreign to Europe as unlike Japan is much larger as a land and the people on it are much more diverse. Also we have real winter\\n\r\n14. Apparently being the ultimate effeminate cuck gives one the ability to strategise despite testosterone being the main factor for a good strategist and also makes you look masculine\\n\r\n15. why simply executing the people that took part of the conspiration never ocured to anyone?\\n\r\n16. There is no rain, mist, snow,etc. All things that can change the path of a battle\\n\r\n17. The motives of various faction that represent European countries or populations (Greek, German, Slavs, Vikings, Muslim) are grossly misunderstood\\n\r\n18. Generally none of the fighters think about conjuring beings of chaos as a military strategy to create disorder in the opposite camp. There is only one case towards the end and then they simply conjure one single giant clumsy being which is easily defeated instead of many smaller ones whcih could overcome by sheer numbers\\n\r\n19. just because the grancrest is created does not mean that things will change much apart from the dissapearence of magic and magic creatures. Someone still needs to work the lands.",

By episode 1 there was already romance, and I would have preferred something like the MC blushing, in fact the meeting between the heroine and the MC wasn't impactful at all; it was more like a casual walk in the park and the next episode you find out there's this sudden romance. Not only that, but antagonists and monsters that took an entire army to beat were defeated in an extremely short time nonetheless by a group of 3-4 people. I wasn't aware that the characters possessed thestrength of a hundred men. Moreover, because of this pacing, the anime was lacking character development other main characters and secondary character save for Siluca and Theo. As a result deaths( to be expected since it's a war anime) didn't matter much. The content in this anime could have easily been stretched out into another season or maybe two more with a bit more plot to go with it. Also, sometimes, during fight scenes the production dept. apparently confiscates the \"solidity\" of the characters for the fluidity of them. So it looks more like an incomplete painting to me.(-4)\\n\r\n     Besides this, I found the plot enjoyable(in fact the whole crest thing was really cool)and I especially loved the whole idea about crests and Siluca happens to be my favourite. I don't know much about the others nor do I care, however Theo seems stupid when he talks sometimes but he isn't an annoying MC which is a saving grace as most MCs who try to do something noble act rash and stupid. The art was good overall(average per 2018). I'd give this a 6/10 - enjoyable, but could be made better.",

So I am just going to rant on one thing: \"Logic\".\r\nWhat I am trying to say is, this show is an offence against anybody who knows anything about medieval warfare. And I don\u00b4t mean \"earthly medieval warfare\" I mean \"inner world medieval warfare, with magic, crests and werewolves\". \r\nSPOILERS AHEAD!\r\nI could give a lot of examples but I will just give you the two that made my blood boil the most.\r\nSo lets start out with Rebbecca, I felt almost kind of bad for her situation, but then she did one thing that nobody in thereright mind would do: \\n\\n\r\n\"Grapple an armed fleeing Lord, without a weapon, or any intention on taking him down\". I mean \"really?!\" what would have been the problem with:\\n\r\n\"She stabbs him with a knife, axe or any other object she totally got when the villagers charged at the armed soldiers?\"\\n\r\nBut no, she just grapples him, and he stabs her...because that...thing (I don\u00b4t want to call her human at this point) is running around on a battlefield without any kind of weapon...\\n\r\nAnd for what? To have a cheap death of an character that was introduced 5 minutes ago, whoopdi fucking do, writing 101, best character ever 10/10 would kill again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe second one is the main problem. Milza...\\n\r\nAnd, don\u00b4t get me wrong, I like the whole \"I am bad shit insane and kill everyone that isn\u00b4t sharing my worldview\"-kind of thing, it\u00b4s again very cheap writing, but not the problem.\\n\r\nThe problem are his realitybreaking skills. \\n\r\nI am ok with him being superfast, superstrong and the best fighter there is. And I am ok with him being able to dodge any attack thrown at him, because he is fast and stuff. He has the most useless short-saber I have ever seen, but I am also ok with that.\\n\r\nWhat I am not ok with is him, sitting on a horse, killing 3 guys with spears...\\n\r\nLets just put it that way, if you come at 3 guys with a spears just having a short saber, you are empaled on them before you are even in range for hitting them. Especially if you are sitting on a fucking horse.\\n\\n\r\nJust needed to get that out of my system, thanks for your time.",

All we need is a premise for this war to occur...\" and no one called them out on the one easily fixable glaring issue the show has: There is no logical or emotional reason for any of this to be happening. And it would be so easy to have written something, anything, that even sort of justified going to war. Like each side being suspicious the other was responsible for the attack or something but none of that happens.\\n\\n\r\nI would give this show a 9.5/10 but because THERE IS NO REASON FOR ANY OF THE EVENTS IN THE SHOW TO TAKE PLACE I'm bumping it down to an 8/10.",

It's a waste of time that actually feels like a waste of time as you watch it because it doesn't manage the basics of entertainment, there are bad series you can watch through to the end because they at least manage these, this is not one of them - reading the wiki episode summaries made me so SO grateful for my better judgement (the series basically plays out as it's described in a 'then this happened then this happened' way for what I've seen with little to no reasoning behind it and way too much going on in such a short time).",

            "content": "A historical marriage to symbolise peace between the two main warring factions of Atlatan, Factory Alliance and Fantasia Union falls apart. Treated as an assassination, it was now known as \"The Great Hall Tragedy\" and conflict continues between nations. Having witnessed the incident during her graduation, Siluca Meletes the prodigy mage was now reluctantly going off to serve a new lord. However, a group of mercenaries from the opposing faction stops her during her journey there and just then she meets the wandering Theo who comes to her rescue. Not knowing Siluca's abilities, he fends off the mercenaries. Theo had created his own Crest fromthe dark Chaos energy that leaked across the country allowing demons to appear from another dimension to raise terror. The Crest's power allowed humans to battle with them but, the lords who possess them had long forgotten their purpose and now it was more a symbol of status that they fight over for.\\n\\n\r\nAfter learning Theo wanted to strengthen his Crest so he may free his poverished town from tyrannic rule in Sistina, Siluca decides to help him and make him her new ideal lord. He had the potential to help her own ambition of restoring peace and destroying the Chaos energy that threatened the lands once and for all. After taking over the Crest from the lord that attacked Siluca, Theo now gained the status he needed to achieve his goals but he still had a long road ahead of him before they could both achieve their ambitions.\\n\\n\r\nThe show gets off to an interesting start. Your heroine Siluca isn't one that's just a damsel-in-distress but the one pulling the strings and ends up being the important support behind Theo, who starts out as a naive average skilled swordsman. However, he isn't completely outshone since his chivalry and compassion wins over many allies. It's cute watching the relation between the two blossom out of mutual respect and grow to achieve their ambitions which, feels natural instead of your \"hero gets the girl\" kind of direction. Yes, there's romance in this show but it can be devastatingly heart breaking as it can be warm and fuzzy. There's a fair bit of drama and you kind of sympathise with characters caught up in the politics and conflict. Their responsibilities and lineage often force them to take desperate and drastic action which usually ends up in tragedy as they deny themselves of their own personal interests. It can get quite dark and brutal. Some have compared it to a rushed Japanese version of Game of Thrones.\\n\\n\r\nFantasy world based shows usually don't differ by much and this show doesn't stray far from it with the usual roles, your nations at war but, it does have a few things that help give the world setting a bit of originality. The demonic beings are actually intelligent and play a role in keeping the world safe which is better than your usual mindless monsters added in just to be slain. Even witches are differentiated as black or white. However, the way the Crests work feels like levelling up in an RPG which kind of detracts from the world setting's charm. Sometimes the show can actually feel like a cutscene out of a really bad JRPG.\\n\\n\r\nAction scenes are interesting with your grand battles and a bit of gore which is probably expected in a fantasy show but I've seen worse. Character fight scenes are good and I probably wouldn't have expected less from the studio behind Sword Art Online. There's a lot of focus on body language such as movement of the eyes and hands during dialogue. Sound effects and music do a good job of bringing out the atmosphere although there weren't any tunes that really made an impression. Art's not too bad although you can clearly see some quality drop in the odd episode and, the 3D animation really sticks out like a sore thumb often too stiff looking. The show starts off with little to no fan service apart from the odd alluring attire as you'd expect from fantasy shows but, it does eventually choose some awkward camera angles. There are also some scenes that are just savage so definitely not a show for the younger audience as they can be quite explicit.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, this show is based on a 10 volume light novel series of the same name and it's written by Ryo Mizuno best known for the classic Record of Lodoss War. Lodoss is more straight forward with just the good and bad sides fighting it out starring your RPG style party of heroes who turns the tide, no tactics or conspiracy. It's more adventure oriented so not quite as tragic as this and the overall art style is more consistent without the 3D animations. However, this show has better character development which is probably why I found it more enjoyable than Lodoss because you actually feel bad for them when something tragic happens. It also has the better romance if that's what you're after in a fantasy world show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a fantasy show with a story that can be so good at times but also so ridiculously silly at others. It's filled with action, romance and power struggle at a grand scale just like its title suggests. Be prepared for some really dark moments and don't miss the extra scenes they sometimes have after the credits. Either you'll enjoy this show on the whole with its great cast of characters or end up remembering it for the wrong reasons.",
