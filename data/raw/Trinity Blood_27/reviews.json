            "content": "Some people say it's a Hellsing rip-off, some people say it's a Trigun rip-off, some people say it rips off scenes from Equilibrium (which it does), however, that doesn't change the fact that the series is enjoyable... sort of.\r\nStory: Why I say \"sort of\" is because of how confusing this story can be. It sort of assumes that the viewer has already read and manga and/or the novels. I've watched TB with many of my friends and in almost every episode I have had to explain to them what is happening - Why is an episode called \"the Iblis\" when they never explain what theIblis is? Why is Abel a Crusnik? Why is the world in the state that it is? What's with the flashback scenes? Etc, etc. Also the pacing is sort of off - an episode full of action will be followed by an episode of nothing but political intrigue and sitting around talking. I give Story a 7 if only because it is somewhat inaccessable to new viewers, possibly to the point of frustration if you don't know what's going on, and also for the pacing issues.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound are very good so I give them both 9. The art is beautiful (except for the stupid CG, which there is thankfully not much of), the music is great, and if you're watching the English dub, the voices are actually not bad at all (except Ion...  *shudders*)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter gets a 10. Lots of character development throughout the show. I've heard Abel is similar to Vash, so if you like Vash you may like him as well. Most all of the characters are complex and interesting. Even many of those that seem flat at the start later reveal many sides to themselves. I think that is my favorite thing about this anime, how even minor characters grow and develop as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment gets a 9 from me. However, I predict most people would enjoy it at maybe an 8 (or possibly a 7) level, which is why I rate it overall 8. It's a great story and generally underappreciated, but I do understand that it's quite inaccessable unless you already know the backstory. So my suggestion is this: Read a synopsis of the backstory first, then watch the anime. Better yet, read the manga or the novels first. Trinity Blood is best enjoyed as a unit (manga, novels, and anime) rather than as just an anime. All three of the storylines are slightly different, each adds its own dimension to the world. As a stand-alone anime TB is pretty good, but taken with the other works it is amazing!",

            "content": "Reviewer's brief notables:  If you're a fan of the Trigun series, Trinity Blood just might be the next best thing.\r\n______________________________________________________________\r\nStory:\r\nThere are several things in the story that, I believe, need to be included into the current synopsis. There are many key details that viewers must acknowledge to fully appreciate the story behind Trinity Blood.\r\nIn the series' current setting, there are two forces: the Terran (Human) and the Methuselah (Vampire). The story is based 500 years after the Armageddon in the future of Europe. The anime does carry much of European architectural design and also displays many notable landmarks that are found in Europe presently.\\n\r\nThe Terran population is more resembled upon civilized life presently. They have a monarch approach of government rule that is highly organized and nobly respected. As it seems to the story, the Roman Catholic Church is the foundation of the political and martial power of the Terran including the presence of a Pope. The Terran force is also referred to as the Vaticans.\\n\\n\r\nThe Methuselah population was once human. At a time, there was an outbreak of a virus infecting human beings. The virus would feed on the host's blood cells until they deplete. Soon after, they thirst for more blood to keep themselves alive. Symptoms of the virus include the mutation of their genetic makeup and also to latent superhuman abilities that varies between hosts. With the crave for blood and newfound abilities, they are commonly and ironically called Vampires.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the Vatican and the Methuselah forces are engaging an ongoing war. Both of these races have the same motive: to eliminate the opposing race. This does not relate to everybody though. There is a resistance group that wants the Terran and Methuselah to coexist in harmony. This group being called, &quot;Ax&quot;. The members of &quot;Ax&quot; include very aristocratic individuals from both sides of the field.\\n\\n\r\n      As for the real story review, I think this anime has outdone itself. Trinity Blood has a very rich and deep plotline that is very consistent and also very engaging. Trinity Blood reveals an ample amount of information for its 26 episode season, but is also simple to understand. There are two things that I have to complain about. First being how there are several plot holes in the season about Abel's past and identity. Second, being what I feel, an incomplete ending. It seems as this anime, though ironically, pushes an abundant amount of information at you, and yet seems to slip some of the more significant essence. If excluding that setback, I'd say this series is nearly perfect.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n     I truly like Trinity Blood's style of animation. The style is mostly seen in more action-oriented genres, like Trigun, but possibly a step better in quality. For the animation, there is nothing really to complain about. On the other hand, the CG behind Trinity Blood is quite terrible. For its time in production, I'd expect far better CG. The CG looked very edgy and choppy--also looks, and feels like it doesn't belong with the standard animation. Being that, I give the Art an Eight out of Ten.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n     The introductory song to each episode fit in nicely with the opening animation and the overall feel of the anime. Nicely done. The music scores in this anime are nicely done as well. The music was very appropriate at each scene. I gave the Sound portion an Eight because in some instances in the series, the background music was overplaying the voices of the characters, especially during sensitive and important scenes where the characters talk in a soft manner. It just seemed to really bother me.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n     The main character in this anime, Abel Nighroad, is much like and often compared to Vash the Stampede of the anime, Trigun. They both are very cooperative and kind also somewhat of a pacifist. They also have refused to kill any human at any point of time. They have a lust for food; Abel being tea with 13 spoons of sugar and Vash being of donuts. Also, the two characters have very devastating capabilities with immeasurable potential.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, there is some MAJOR character development. Possibly taking up most of the series itself. There are several flashbacks and isolated thinking scenes that reveal much more of the characters. I personally, was swept up by almost all of the characters which made me have their upmost support.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is, what I think, the real strongpoint of this anime. It is possible the very thing that had me hooked to this anime.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n     I can't say that you won't enjoy this series if you're not ready to see some very gory violence (blood, severed limbs, decapitation). Though with all the violence, it really makes Trinity Blood more engaging and much deeper. It's just not the same without it. Trinity Blood is one of the very few series' where I can freely just literally shout at my computer all my many emotions that go on throughout the series. Very engaging indeed. As I've mentioned, or along the lines of, the enjoyment factor is upon the character development--well, for me it is. I would say that I would enjoy this series much more if it had a second season to cap off some of the missing links in the series.",

            "content": "\"Trinity Blood\" is basically the most esoteric term for \"shitty plagiarism\" ever concocted. It's the name given to a series about a bipolar four-eyed immortal space vampire and his gaggle of irrelevant friends on their quest to get to the end of a story where the author was killed before he had a chance to end it. Why was he killed? Hellsing and Trigun were raking in lots of money at the time and their authors caught wind of some douche stealing their ideas and peddling it to stupid girls by plastering shoujo art all over them. In this writing I will explain every reasonto avoid the remnants of that fanfiction-writing hack's life.\\n\\n\r\nReason Alpha: What's on the Screen.\\n\\n\r\nThis animated fanfic stars Vashucard, member of the Heavensing organization. She's a bumbling doofus with glasses who kills no humans, but murders vampires. When she gets mad, she spouts out some babble about releasing safety locks and restrictions, and turns into a drill-haired dame with lipstick and fangs. Joining him are a mary sue in a nun outfit, robo-Piccolo and some other guys you won't remember because they're only relevant for one episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd those episodes are the only good ones. The fanfic starts by introducing semi-enjoyable characters(aside from the terrible main duo) in one-shot episodes that are never referenced or called back to again. After that 90 or so minutes of collective entertainment, you're stuck watching some shittilly-paced crossover story about absolutely nothing, with no conclusion. At the end, the viewer gains nothing but the bare minimum of visual entertainment. They walk away with no morals learned or memories of good presentation and writing. It's a completely worthless, ephemeral experience that lasts 12 hours.\\n\\n\r\nI wish there was more to dissect or rant about, but there really isn't. I could talk about how Vashucard's back story is the same as Vash the Stampede's, or how the series ends the same way Hellsing(the first anime, the bad one) did with random resurrections and shit that never mattered, but then maybe I'd be flagged for spoiling the writings of some dead ass with the imagination of a 11-year old girl? I could talk about the endless camera pan shots and fade-ins that draw in the eyes of girls looking for pretty-colored bishounen, or badly choreographed and unsubstantial amount of action the fanfic offers, but those are self-explanatory.\\n\\n\r\nReason Omega: What's not on the Screen.\\n\\n\r\nHave you seen Hellsing? Have you seen Hellsing Ultimate? Have you read Hellsing? Have you watched Trigun? Have you read Trigun? Have you seen or read the dozens of other mediocre vampire shoujo anime and manga that are better than this? How about all them vampire action movies with actual action? If you answered no to any of those questions, fix it instead of watching this. If you answered yes to all of the previous questions, then only watch this to have \"that one piece of shit\" on your list. There is not a single valid reason to watch this tripe at all.\\n\\n\r\nThis fanfiction is a stupid, badly written, boring and unfinished waste of my time, your time and the time of the brave men who made the trek to throw Yoshida Sunao into a volcano.",

            "content": "I first heard about trinity blood on a forum in the summer of last year. Not too much detail was given except for the small facts that it had vampires and a group of super soldiers working for the Catholic Church fighting against each other. Slightly intrigued I started browsing the web to research it a bit more, before I decided to watch it. During that research I found this description on the back story.\r\n\u2018When Earth's population drastically increased, humanity was led by the United Nations attempt to colonize Mars. During the colonization, they discovered two alien technologies: the Bacillus and the Crusnik nanomachines. Thecolonists installed the Bacillus in their bodies which transformed them into Methuselahs. Continuing wars on Earth eventually led to \"Armageddon,\" the apocalyptic event that happened 900 years before the start of the story, and the colonists returned to Earth to help with rebuilding. However, when the colonists returned to Earth, a war broke out between the Methuselahs and the humans who had remained on earth.\u2019\\n\\n\r\nThis prologue was the main reason I decided to watch Trinity blood. Not only did it explain how vampires came into existence but why humans are at war with them. On top of that my favorite studio Gonzo was the creator.  \\n\\n\r\nI went into the first episode with excitement and for the most part I found the first episode very entertaining and fun to watch. The story follows a man named Abel Nightroad, a member of the Vatican and an AX agent trained to kill vampires. While traveling on a airship back to the capitol the ship is attacked and over taken by a pure blood vampire. Nightroad confronts the vampire on top of the airship where he shows his true form, a Crusnik, a being that feasts on vampire blood. This transformation is awesome on every sense of the word and I left that first episode with good feeling.   The artwork was beautifully gothic and dark, setting the mood perfectly. The english dub was decent (as you aspect from funimation) and the main character had a split personality and was interesting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI left that first tale in the series with high optimism and excitement for the remaining 23 episodes. Want followed was some of the most inconsistent story arcs I have ever seen. The series hit a break wall already in the early episodes. It had become so boring with too much text and not enough action or development happing. I was thinking of the dropping the show around the fifth episode when out of no where I would get the awesome action packed episode I was looking for. Then straight after, the show would be back to boring text episodes where nothing happens. It seemed for every great episode I watched, 2 crap ones immediately followed, and the cycle would continue like that.     \\n\\n\r\nThe show also suffered from lack of development for the supporting characters. \\n\r\nWe are finally introduced to other AX agents who have great potential to be developed characters and they are barely in it. \\n\\n\r\nFor its faults there was something about Trinity blood that made me keep watching. It maybe because I got into a routine of seating through the pointless episodes, because I new, in the back of my head that soon there will be a kick ass episode right round the corner. And I was right.\\n\\n\r\nThe series had its strong points for sure. The soundtrack was haunting and fantastic along with the character designs being extremely cool. The development on the main character is also one of the highest points of the show. Half the fun of the series is figuring him out and his back story is revealed bit by bit making you want to keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to any one who digs vampires or who needs an action fix. But be warned it\u2019s not for everyone, a series like this needs attention and above all patents. You need to bear through the bad, to get to the good\\n",

I figured, it'd be better in action, right?\r\nWrong.\r\nThe anime starts out completly random, which could be forgiven, but it entirely ignores the cardinal rule of anime by explaining the basics by at least the end of the second episode. This leaves the viewer completly and utterly lost.\r\nThe first episode starts with an adventure on a plane, then the second one jumps to when he's at the church. If I didn't know whatwas going on via manga, I'd be so confused. They don't bother to explain why he's working for the the church, how he got there after the plane incident, and who the robot guy is. It just jumps in and expects you to know.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, all of the episodes have absolutly no relation to each other AT ALL. Except for when it says Part 1 and Part 2, each episode could take place anywhere in the series.\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: Go manga on this one.",

I forced myself to see it until the end and i can see now that it have the most NONSENSE episodes never seen.\r\nWhy? Let me explain few things.\r\n-ATTENTION: MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS(not on the main story)-\r\n1)Abel < Vash\r\nSomeone says that Abel is the bad copy of Vash(Trigun Anime). Well it's true, but very very the worst copy seen. In one episode he stated that i had promise(in the past) to not kill no one else. Well in the first episode he kill a vampire telling \"you are been executed\". Inanother episode airships are attacking a city with a big tank drove by a bad guy. Like often happen, he get mad and oneshot everything. \\n\\n\r\n2)Immortal enemies\\n\r\nThe WORST thing in an anime. They had been shotted, exploded, cutted and? They are still here. Ok Dietrich can use dead body BUT THAT BODY WAS EXPLODED WITH THE TANK! The vampire woman that abduct the witch girl was kicked by \"Demon-Abel\"; now you are a kick-ass freaking demon: if you want kill someone you SHOULD KILL HIM and if you don't want kill him you should take him to prison but NOOO!! Surprise and ambush! She is still alive! I never expected this!\\n\\n\r\n3)Non-sense plot\\n\r\nRadu burn the palace where Lady Caterina hoping that the Vaticano will kill Ion. Ion come back wounded and what he does? He aid him and save his life. Later he go to prepare the boat: 10 mins to take a gun and come back. Perfect time to let Esther and Ion talk a LOT. It was already the dead body? So why the hell he should suffer the wounds?! Just kill Ion! This is only an example, a lot of scenes are non-sense only to show useless things (like the vampire woman revenge only to show that the robot have \"feelings\")\\n\\n\r\n4)The best scene\\n\r\nDemon-Abel hit hard Isaak Fernand etc etc. He is on the ground heavily wounded. When Abel miss his target he just say \"It's time to go\", stand up and disappear. A THAT KIND wound SUPPOSE that you cannot move easily but he just stand up and disappear in one second (the disappear skill is like a teleport because no one in the all Vaticano caught him).\\n\\n\r\nThis anime's fans will forgive me. It is nice, but only for who doesn't expect a TRUE story from it.\\n",

            "content": "First of all, I will say that I did not watch Trigun before seeing this. This I say because most people will tell you that this is a ripoff of Trigun. I have not seen it at this point, so I do not know.\r\n___________________________________________________________________\r\nPrologue:\r\n The anime was a great one, if you are a fan of action this has plenty of it, if you want drama this has plenty of it, if you are a fan of vampires this has plenty of it, if you are a fan of sci-fi this has plenty of it (no mechas though), and last of all if you enjoyhistory and some political fiction this has plenty of it. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I really enjoyed the allusion to historical empires and political ideologies present in the anime. For example: The New Human Empire (aka Empire of the True Race / Methuselah Empire) is very influenced by the Ottoman Empire, going as far as to have the Imperial Janissaries do the same job they did in the actual Empire, being the household guard of the Emperor (Empress, in the case of the anime) that and a mix of the earlier Byzantine Empire which was succeeded by the Ottoman Empire. Vatican is representative of the EU, and an allusion to the medieval Christian philosophies of the Roman Catholic Church. Albion is, I believe, the modern England adapted into the anime controlling only the British Isles at this point as well as being neutral in the Vatican - Empire tensions. Also, being born in Istanbul and spending the first 5 years of my life there (as well as many visits) I can say Istanbul was very nicely adapted into the Byzantium of the anime, which is the capital of the Empire as it was in the Ottoman Empire. Hell, even the parts of the city are accurately portrayed!\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I did not like about the anime was, it does not give much background information at all... The story is perfect! But the only thing the anime tells you is that there is a conflict between Vampires and Terrans and that this leads to tensions between the Vatican and the Empire. For this I had to read various sources to get information about the background, which might have led me to enjoy the anime fully. However, I really hesitated giving this a 10 because of that, had it portrayed the background nicely I would not have even thought of any other score. \\n\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is perfect! However, if you are reading this I suggest that you do not become discouraged by the length and keep on reading as I will be telling much of the points of the story that I wish were told at the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nAt one point in the history of Earth, humans colonized Mars. And the colonists discovered two types of nanomachines there left by an earlier civilization: the Bacillus and the Crusnik. They subsequently injected the nanomachines, and those with the Bacillus were turned into the Methuselah, or as termed by normal humans (called Terrans by the Methuselah) into vampires. However, those with Crusnik installed into them do not live, except for four, who are Abel, Cain, Seth and Lilith.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the colonists returned to Earth, a war broke out between the Methuselahs and the humans who had remained on earth. Abel, Cain, and Seth took the Methuselah's side&mdash;while Lilith supported the humans' side. The continuing war eventually led to &quot;Armageddon,&quot; the apocalyptic event that happened 900 years before the start of the story. During the war, Cain went insane and killed Lilith. In grief, Abel took her body to the Vatican where she was buried. Abel remained at her side, weeping for her, for 900 years.\\n\\n\r\nAt the start of the story, there is an uneasy truce between the Methuselah and the Terrans. The Roman Catholic Church is a major military power determined to protect humans from the Methuselahs, with its seat of power based in the Vatican. The Methuselahs have their capital of Byzantium, which is surrounded by a field of particles to filter out UV radiation, protecting the Methuselah population.  However, the Methuselah have an Empress that wishes for peace, and the Vatican is reluctant to start hostilities against the Empire because the Empire is the most technologically advanced nation on earth, with weapons and machines that surpass both the Vatican arsenal and Albion.\\n\\n\r\nBoth groups use &quot;lost technologies,&quot; such as airships, missiles, and computers, to engage in a cold war with one another. A third great power, Albion also plays a role in the war with its superior arsenal of lost technology and weapons and higher level of manufacturing ability versus the Vatican. The independent monarchy of Albion is a primarily human country, however the secret of their expertise in lost technology is found in the Ghetto, an underground city of enslaved Methuselah. It is these Methuselah who operate and manufacture the lost technology, but with the death of the Albion Queen, some of the enslaved vampires begin a rebellion for the freedom of all of the Ghetto residents.\\n\\n\r\nLast of all, Crusniks are beings that drink the blood of Methuselah, while the Methuselah are beings likened to vampires because of their superior strength, agility, prolonged life span, regenerative traits and their inability to be exposed to the sun (as the nanomachines would burn the host) together with their weakness to silver and their necessity to regularly drink human blood because the nanomachines are constantly destroying their red blood cells. They can have children, and they can eat normal food.\\n\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art / animation is good as it is not an old anime. The blurry-ish look really gets one into the story's dramatic and tragic tones. The way the faces of each character is drawn also hints at their respective character personalities. Also, the facial movements and eye effects truly reflect the mood of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe color choices used in the anime are really good for the atmosphere of the overall plot.\\n\\n\r\nOther than those, there is not much I can say about the animation as it is not really an old anime.\\n\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and the ED were both really good, even when I did not really want to spend much time I could not stop myself from watching / listening them.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sounds used in the anime really help in setting the atmosphere of the moment. Especially I paid attention to it at the final episode where it really fit in with what was going on. There is no other way that I can describe that than saying it was &quot;Epic&quot;. \\n\\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI was actually kinda disappointed as there were no special characters like, say Lelouch, in this anime. They were all rather typical characters, you know, the guy with the tragic past (who I think over exaggerated it), the whiny-yet-nice-so-you-cant-get-mad-at girl, the little aristocrat boy who falls in love with a commoner and can't bring himself to say so, the best friend who betrays but then comes back in the end as he is about to kill his helpless best bud, the empress in disguise, the fanatically loyal guy who goes mad with his loyalty only to realize his mistake at the end... etc.\\n\\n\r\nSo the characters are all ones used in previous works with not much originality other than their adaptation into the awesome storyline of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series, however the enjoyment at the beginning was limited due to the frequent plot changes at the first few episodes and the storyline that was not efficiently given at all.\\n\\n\r\nLater on though, after the involvement of Esther into the plotline, the enjoyment increased as I started seeing political conspiracies, fanaticism, ideologies, and tragedy... of course not forgetting the epic action scenes which were really good btw.\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nAlthough due to the lack of information about the background storyline at the beginning, I really hesitated giving this show such a high score, I could not help but do so knowing the actual storyline and having finished the series together with the ending. \\n\\n\r\nI really hope they would make a continuation of the story, as after properly knowing the storyline the series is truly a masterpiece quality one. That is of course in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless I highly recommend this anime, and I REALLY REALLY want to point out that you SHOULD DEFINITELY READ ABOUT THE BACKGROUND STORY BEFORE STARTING THE SHOW!!! What I wrote about the background story in the story section should be sufficient, although of course knowing more doesn't hurt ;).",

What makes me particularly sad about this series is that it had potential to be distinguishing and as good as Hellsing or Blood+ but it does earn a moniker in my worst anime list as a \"number 2.\" The talent behind the art and the voice acting especially from funimation that gives us Fullmetal Alchemist and the Samurai 7 dubs, were all wasted in this god-awful mess of a show. Thelargest gapping problem for me at least is that the show sincerely focused on geo-politics yet they little focused on vampirism. Was there some tears to the script. Plus the characterizations were just flat or just embarrassing for example I found Ester to be very attractive but then she must have this emotional attachment to an obnoxious retard named Abel. That is much I can remember from Trinity Blood because when I am writing this, I just got back from watching There Will Be Blood. Even that had more Blood than this piece of poo.",

            "content": "Okay, here is my review for the anime Trinity Blood after watching the complete series.\r\nStory (10) - Purely fascinating.  Classic Vampire-Human drama and all that would encompass such with a amazing twist.  A Japanese \"what if tale\" about the \"Vatican\" church, and all of it's not-so-known enforcers.  (If only that we're really the case, how much cooler a religion would be.)  I am happy to say that there aren't many filler episodes within this series, which is great.  I love a hard-written story driven anime, and this one has that for sure hands down.\r\nArt (8) - Only have seeing atotal of three anime series now, I would say this was nothing all that spectacular.  It was indeed, just very good.  Nothing was hard to make out, all of the backgrounds, character designs, both futuristic and or medieval was done very well.  I will note one thing that did stand out, the weapon of Abel Nightroad was quite possibly the single coolest melee weapon I've yet to ever see in any genre. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9) - Well, as a new review-er.  It was hard to pick a favorite for this series, at first it was Tres, in the end however I would have to go with Caterina Sforza, being a large part of the show herself, she had a very commanding presence and always brought a light to the situation at hand.  As for the rest of the cast, all was quite brilliant, each character possessing a particular skill that was either distinct and/or original.  The only reason why it didn't earn a (10) was due to some of the childish like behavior from Abel Nightroad, I found it to be a tad over-done considering the role of him.  Well, and...  Who doesn't love a Crusnik... I mean seriously...\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9) - For the lover of Vampires-Humans in a \"plot-vs-plot\" but not sure what's-what.  Does that make sense to you?  Strong storyline, great character inter-personal relationships, hardly any filler episodes.  Mysterious Crusnik Vampire class.  A great series that won't make you feel bad for not going to church!",

            "content": "Last week I talked about Gonzo with a look at Final Fantasy- Unlimited. This week we have another Gonzo anime with Trinity Blood. The series began as a series of light novels by the now deceased Yoshida Sunao. It was adapted into a manga that's still ongoing and into this anime which aired in 2005. Let's take a look at it and see how Gonzo did with this one.\r\nStory:\r\nIn some indeterminate time in the future, humanity has changed. We're separated into two basic types. The ordinary humans of today, called Terrans and the vampiric Methuselah. There's a territorial; divide with a lot of western Europebeing Terran controlled & eastern Europe being Methuselah with some neutral nations acting as a buffer. Unfortunately, the uneasy peace is being threatened by the Rosenkreuz Order. It's up to Father Abel Nightroad and his comrades at the Vatican to put an end to their machinations.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with this series is a simple one. Virtually everything that happens in it is really obvious and predictable. Because this story doesn't so much put twists on clich\u00e9s to make it its own as run down the list and pick all the ones it likes to just throw in completely true to form. And this is a point I've made before, a good writer can use unoriginal ideas and turn them into something unique. Terry Pratchett did it with his personification of Death. Miyabe Miyuki did it with a story about a boy transported to another world, even if the Brave Story film was bollocks, the novel did a really stellar job with it. But an unskilled writer will just toss every over done, tired, generic plot point they can into their work and it just comes across as trite. Which is what happens here. I'll give some examples but I won't name names because I don't want to spoil a lot. There's a bit where the series makes sure to point out something unusual on one of the female characters and the obvious place to go with it is that she's actually royalty or something and that's why that's there. Which is exactly where the series goes with it. There's also a minor character death where everything leading up to it is stuff that would typically come before a character's death. There's a sudden focus on their relationship with the protagonist, they're having a bonding experience and then they get separated and go off into a dangerous situation and you know that character isn't coming back. The one thing that might have been surprising is spoiled in the ending theme tune & even then you know where they're going to eventually go with it. There's just nothing that happens narratively that actually surprises or engages you. Maybe they would if this was one of your first action anime but if you've seen a decent number, this is all old hat.\\n\\n\r\nThey also seem to have \u201cborrowed\u201d a lot of ideas from Trigun. Except that they were a lot better executed in that series. And this isn't like Hunter x Hunter where some things were clearly inspired by Dragonball but they were modified into something unique to that series. This is a lot more copy-pasted. Also, what kind of a surname is \u201cNightroad\u201d for a vampire. That would be like having a witch with the surname Hexe.... I redact the name criticism immediately.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest pity is that this series did have potential. The idea of vampires and humans openly living side by side but in a state of unease could have been really interesting. The execution is just tepid and ends up spoiling the concept.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast suffers from the same issue as the story. They're just really archetypical and uninteresting as a consequence. Father Nightroad is that variety of shounen protagonist who's powerful but kind of goofy and hiding a tragic back story. Think of a super watered down version of Vash the Stampede without any of those elements that make Vash compelling. Then we have Sister Esther. She's the super pure, kind and supportive girl who isn't too good in a fight but tries her best. The prickly action girl with a kind side role is taken by Astharoshe.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art varies. The cityscapes tend to be pretty good. Some of the futuristic technology looks cool. The character designs are a bit plain, but work. Except for Father Nightroad's transformed version. He looks like a Goth kid is trying to make themselves look \u201cdark & brooding\u201d but the youngster in question has no sense of subtlety so they way overdo it. He also has hair that sticks up in a way that makes the super saiyajins look subdued. To think, those five gallons of hair gel could've been used to spike the hair of a hundred idiot frat boys. Even his weapon looks absurd. The cg doesn't always mesh well with the rest of the artwork either. The wings look really out of place, there are times when you'll get a bit of technology that clashes with everything around it. Some of the more outlandish attacks look awkward. The action sequences as a whole aren't very good. They're kind of lazily done.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe acting in this is pretty good. Which isn't surprising with a cast that includes such names as Noto Mamiko, Touchi Hiroki & Honda Takako. I don't think it really challenged any of them since the characters are just flat tropes, but it's still good. Eguchi Takahito's music is decent enough.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThis doesn't really have any ho-yay. It has a good deal of het. I guess in this version of the future the Catholic church decided to lose the celibacy vows as a method of stopping the priests from touching children. Wouldn't it be great if the actual Catholic church did literally anything to try and stop that instead of just relocating the problem priests and pretending everything was fine?\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nI won't say that Trinity Blood is a bad anime. That being said, it certainly isn't good. It's a series that has a premise with a lot of potential but wastes it with a serious over-reliance on clich\u00e9s and, to make it a bit worse, it outright plagiarises content from Trigun. So, I'd suggest just watching Trigun instead. Because this series hasn't a single creative bone in its proverbial body. My final rating for Trinity Blood is going to be a 4/10. It's below average. Next week is Valentine's day, so let's look at something with a romantic bend. The review is going to be on Junjou Romantica. That seems like a good choice.",

            "content": "The story and characters in this series are fantastically enigmatic and complex.  Ultimately the characters and their relationships are as interesting as the overall plot line.  The biggest drawback to this series is that it ends without really explaining some important aspects of the story.  The lack of background throughout the series provides suspense and intrigue, but anyone who has not read the Manga will probably want to look up a synopsis of the plot at some point.  However, the series is definitely worth watching anyway.\r\nThe vampires are largely classical Braum Stokes in nature, though, there are a few interesting twistswhich crop up in the plot and backstory.   The ambience is dark and mysterious, giving the show a dramatic feel.  However, Abel\u2019s antics serve to lighten mood from time to time.  Abel displays many different faces throughout the series-though it seems they are all part of him rather than just masks he wears-providing his character depth not easily achieved in the typical conflicted protagonist role.  Abel\u2019s dorkiness is endearing and is necessary to balance the more serious and painful reality of his past and his current mission.  \\n\\n\r\nThe change that comes over Abel when he releases into his fighting modes is shocking.  He becomes horrible and beautiful, valiant and creepy, powerful and weak.  While his essential shape remains the same, the change in his hair and eyes is chilling.  That Able becomes terrible in his fighting form while the enemy of the world goes from charismatic in his human form to angelic in his fighting form is an appropriate archetype for real life.  Abel\u2019s form is honest to its own nature, while the success of the antagonist is largely due to his devious nature.  He is a master at showing others what they want to see until they are no longer useful to his own purposes.\\n\\n\r\nThough there are some obvious similarities between Abel and the main character in Trigun, the feel of this series is vastly different.  Enough so, that the two series don\u2019t target the same audience.  Where Trigun is often lighthearted and silly, Trinity Blood\u2019s plot weighs heavily as it addresses a variety of social and personal conflict issues.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Trinity Blood is an intriguing story which draws the viewer in both through the overriding plot and through the depth of the characters and their own personal struggles.   However, the series should have been extended to include an explanation to the history of events which propelled the world into the current state of affairs.    Instead viewers are forced to look to other sources for any resolution to the story.\\n",

It takes the intervention of Abel Nightroad, a super-vampire far beyond either race, to ensure peace between both races.\r\nThis show stands out from the standard vampire anime for being a space opera. The story is a grand and epic tale, combining elements of sci-fi, horror, political intrigue, drama and even a touch of humour. The use of religiousterms/themes makes this an intriguing and intricate story to explore. The characters are well-written and have interesting background and characterization to explore, and their voice actors are well-chosen (Troy Baker in particular is wonderful as the complex protagonist Abel). And the art is magnificently ornate and expressive, capturing the baroque world and its engaging characters in a stunning format.\\n\\n\r\nThe story lasted only one season, though. It was dealt a heavy blow by the untimely passing of writer Sunao Yoshida, and though the comic continued the story it didn't really feel right; the anime had to end where it did. It's a tragically underrated and incomplete anime. Also the show tends to draw influence from other shows (TRIGUN, TO TERRA, HELLSING, VAMPIRE HUNTER D); it's only a side- effect of the incredibly abundant anime industry, but these inevitable comparisons can take away from how unique and wonderful the show is.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, it's a very intricate and ornate anime that would have turned out to be one of the greatest vampire stories ever told, had fate been kinder to it.",

            "content": "Vampires have been in the media for a long time. Everything ranging from the 1900s till today. But vampires today are not at all what they were years ago. vampires today are sugar coated diamond gay boys that prefer to hook up with young girls that are 1000s of years younger than them (im looking at you twilight). So as you can imagine, walking into a show such as trinity blood was either going to be a hit or miss. To sum it up before you read the rest of this; i enjoyed the hell out of this show. \r\nIll try and keep this reviewas short and straight to the point as possible.\\n\\n\r\n~STORY~\\n\\n\r\nThe story for this show is actually pretty good. in this world lives vampires and humans (obviously). The two species are at the brink of war with each other and it's up to the church to take power and try to resolve the issues and prevent war. As the story progresses though we learn of things such as each sides motives and the \"enemy of the world\". Theirs alot more to this story, but explaining it would treed on spoiler territory.\\n\\n\r\n~ART~\\n\\n\r\nBeing that this show was made back in 2005 ill admit that there are some flaws. However though, this show looks really good. The action scenes and transformations were eye candy and kept you interested till the end. at least it was for me anyway.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\\n\r\nOther than the OP and ED, i can't say that there were many tracks that stood out. Don't get me wrong, the music fit the over all tone of the show and defiantly shined when needed. But there were no songs that I can say were amazing and tell you to go buy the OST. The music is good, but not amazing.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nI think this is both the strongest but weakest point of the show. The main characters got alot of time, development, and connection that had me admire the characters. But the antagonist and side characters didnt get much to it. Some of the side characters never really changed though the show, which is unfortunate but hey, what are you going to do?\\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~\\n\\n\r\nThis show was alot of fun. the show reminded me alot of trigun for reasons that im not willing to explain. It had alot of action, good characters, humor,  and a story that kept me guessing at times. This show is not for everyone, but if you enjoy a somewhat dark shows, vampires, or trigun, There is a really good chance you will love this show. \\n\\n\r\nHowever I would advise you to stream the show before you buy. I advise this because the show is not for everyone, as mentioned. Also there is ALOT of religious references in this show. I dont know how people feel about religious context in there shows, if your not a fan of it...at least stream it, It's still a fun show.",

            "content": "I definitely understand the mixed receivings of \u201cTrinity Blood\u201d. It has a lot of potential, but many times come out as very confusing and incoherent. It also has been accused of copying other work such as Hellsing, something which I must disagree with. Yes, Trinity Blood for shore contains a lot of the same elements as Hellsing, for example a powerful organization (the Vatican) fighting methuselah (vampires), the guns, and having their own trump card in the form of a more powerful being (a krusnik) that drinks the blood of other vampires. Which in my opinion is concepts that gladly can be used again andagain, due to that form of plot are exciting to me. And the execution of Trinity Blood\u00b4s story and the overall feeling is nothing Hellsing, both shows have their own specific touch to it. Worth knowing is that the novel/manga was still ongoing at the time the anime was made, so a satisfying conclusion will be absent in the end. Hence, I will make some comparisons between the manga and the anime in my review.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what was Trinity Blood good attributes and what was it lacking in my opinion? Let\u00b4s get down to that now shall we.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nThe story takes place in an alternative setting of Europe in a distant future. 1000 years ago, Armageddon accrued, and vampires came to exist on earth and the modern technology (called lost technology) was lost in the events. Ever sense, humans (Terrans) and vampires (Methuselah) has been at each other\u2019s throats. Prejudices and fear won\u00b4t let the two races to coexist in peace. The Vatican\u00b4s department of foreign affairs task is to take care of any problem related to vampires, led by cardinal Caterina Sfroza. The division is called AX, and includes some of the elite fighters and agents within the Vatican. \\n\\n\r\nDuring a mission, Father Abel Nightroad encounter the young sister Esther Blanchett, and after her adopted family is murdered by the city\u00b4s ruling vampire, she accompanies him to the Vatican to train and become a team member of the AX. But something is stirring in the shadows, an organization called the Rozencreuz has started to make their move for a world war between the Terrans and Methuselah, and let their leader to take the place as the worlds almighty ruler. \\n\\n\r\nI actually really like the base plot a lot. Powerful organizations fighting each other for different goals, vampires and humans on the brink of war, a bit a revenge quests, and a super powerful being that drinks vampires blood. What\u00b4s not to like! So why a 6 you may ask? Because, as I mentioned before, Trinity Blood\u00b4s story many times comes out as confusing and incoherent. Sometimes I felt like I most have missed like 3 episodes or something, much do to with unexplained major time skips in the story, or missing explanations regarding terms, characters, and important plot devices. Also, what was to be believed important plot events and for shore would have a huge impact on the overall story, was left behind end never mentioned again. Or characters that are introduced are just dumped somewhere and are absent for most of the remaining plot, for them to just show up at convenient moments. That left me very confused at times, so the overall enjoyment was dragged down. The pacing could also be very uneven. A couple of action and information filled episodes could be followed by some very slow and very uninformative ones. \\n\\n\r\nAfter reading about 70% of the manga, I can see the root to these problems. I don\u00b4t know yet if the manga follows true to the novel, but the manga definitely make so much more sense than the anime. The manga is also much more enjoyable, I rate that one a 9 so far. It seems that the anime version of Trinity Blood takes several different routes, and are making a couple of anime original arcs. The anime version is still keeping the main plot as a base, but does several things differently and leave somethings unexplained and unexplored, which makes the whole experience kind of confusing and incoherent. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also has a little Sci-Fi touch, which I after read the manga actually enjoying quite a bit. But in the anime, it was mostly confusing and just added more questions. Of course, as in many story\u00b4s, the mystery elements are one of the alluring aspects, but since the anime was so incoherent and in many aspects uninformative, and never got a sequel... Well, the mystery aspect became more of a confusion factor. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story is kind of dark and tragic, but more light-hearted and comical scenes are also present \u2013 mostly in the form of Father Abel\u00b4s clumsy and specific persona. These moments are a lot funnier and fitting in the manga then in the anime, at least I think so. When some action occurs, it\u00b4s often pretty great. Then you hear \u201cKrusnik, 40% release approved\u201d, you now shit is about to get real.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, the story does have its good parts that really pulled me in, and let me become interested and intrigued. Hence why I started to read the manga, and boy I\u00b4m I glad I did that!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI actually really enjoyed the art. It differs slightly from the manga\u00b4s art, which I liked even more. I would not go so far as call it super unique, but it do has something that make it stand out. Studio Gonzo is the studio behind Trinity Blood, and for the time it was produced (2005) I must say that they did a good job. The characters have long lean bodies, and both men and women have beautiful features. The colour palette is not particularly anime vivid or depressingly dark either. More light and bright colours are used the more light-hearted scenes, and darker colours are used in the more serious scenes (Yay, me to state obvious things). It\u00b4s suites the mood of the show, and are adapted to the atmosphere of a specific scene. I most complement the light setting in the show, it\u2019s almost always spot on, and letting the characters and the environment shin in the same light. I made it feel like the characters always belonged in the environment. The backgrounds are beautiful and detailed, for example a city silhouette or garden. Always a pleasure to look at.  \\n\\n\r\nFor the animation, its good but nothing really outstanding either. Few weird and jerky movements, with an all over smooth feeling to it. The action scenes are nicely done, but are no masterpieces either. Not much CG has been used, and that which has been used are used in a nice manor. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI personally aren\u00b4t a fan of both the OP and the ED. Both felt to slow and boring to me to really suite the show, which has a darker theme. I skipped both after heard them a couple of times. For the OST, it was much better. Dramatical orchestra music during for the action and more serious scenes, and some guitar pieces for the more calm or light-hearted scenes. Absolutely to my liking.\\n\\n\r\nBackground sounds and such, was always on par with what happened on the screen and did its job to highlight an event. \\n\\n\r\nFor the VA\u00b4s (dubbed), I think all did their job very well. The voices matched their characters and often managed to bring out their personality. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nOnce again, I feel like so much potential was lost. Like, I didn\u00b4t even realize that Esther was one of the main characters until I read the manga. She\u00b4s handled in such a way that she could have been the cute side character love interest to Abel, and not the main heroine. Again, here\u00b4s the problems with the different routes the anime chooses to take, Esther\u00b4s development and importance to the plot is completely overshadowed. Her warm, badass and quite funny personality never really came to life in this adaption. Same can be said about Tres (the machine who only serves Caterina). In the manga, he is an important character, and despite being an artificially made human, he has a lot of characterization and development.  \\n\\n\r\nBut I must say that I like all the characters, it\u2019s just that I feel that they weren\u00b4t used to their full potential. Trinity Blood for shore contains a lot of cool, likable and interesting characters. And to my delight many badass female characters is present. Such as the almighty cardinal Caterina, the powerful methuselah Asta-san, and the mysterious girl Seth. All great characters that are pretty fleshed out even in the show. Most of the characters, even the villains, are given specific and intriguing personalities, so at least I would not call them boring or waste of space. Some fill up their role in the show great, and other just feel like random inputs, which never happens in the manga.  \\n\\n\r\nAs far as character development goes, it also limited by these alternative routes. Abel has in the manga together with Esther a wonderful development. And that development comes together with the plot of the manga, in the show he mostly stays the same. The sweet and heart-warming moments he and Esther shares are also very reduced in the show. Abel hides his fears and agony behind this goofy and clumsy persona. He has a dark past, which are slightly explored in the show. Bits and pieces of his past is given, but not at all to give the whole picture. He sees himself as \u201cthe enemy of all humans\u201d, and lives only to repay for the sins he\u00b4s made. The part Esther is playing in Abel\u00b4s embrace of some parts of his past is undermined in the adaption as well, but here they do manage to portray some of Esther\u00b4s importance to Abel, and that she reminds him of someone important to him that he lost long ago. \\n\\n\r\nThe decision to take different routes and cut out some important parts, leave the feeling of somewhat incomplete characters. Not one- or two-dimensional, but just that - incomplete and lacking in something.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nIt may sound from all my whining in this review, that I didn\u00b4t enjoy myself watching this piece, which is wrong. I did enjoy it quite a bit, even if I many times was somewhat confused. I love vampire vs. human story\u00b4s and as a plot base Trinity Blood has a great one! Action, mysteries, a bit a blooming romance, super power and fantasy is some of my favourite genres, and even do the adaption was done in a poorly manor these bits still shined for me. It made me pick up the manga, and for that I\u00b4m always going to be grateful for. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nAbsolutely, worth the watch for me. I love the genres and always crave more vampire story\u00b4s like this. The alternative routes, cut out of important information, limited character development, and a inconclusive ending dragged the score down for me. The thing is that I had soooo many questions during the show that never was answered. Like, how did Abel become a krusnik, and what is krusnik really? What was the Mars project? And what released the Armageddon and why? Hence, I picked up the manga. So, I would recommend the anime Trinity Blood to all of you that like vampire story\u00b4s and can put up with being confused and not getting all your question answered in the end. Because, the art and animation was quite good, so the watch will bring something new. I would recommend Trinity Blood the manga even more, the characters are awesome, the plot is intriguing and exciting, and the art is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nHope you find this rant of a review somewhat helpful and informative!

It starts with a priest, called Abel Nightroad and is job is to solve the problems with vampires for the church. At some point the story turns to the negotiations between the church and the empire, where most of the vampires live. But here is a group that wants to create a war between the church and the empire, to bring destruction to the world,  and for that they do everything to interferein the peace talks. I wont tell you the result, if you want to know watch it ;).\\n\\n\r\nArt (8.6) - I liked it. Character design, ambience design also good, graphics also look good.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7.5) - Just enough to not make this anime worse just because of this aspect. I didnt like it at all, but i dont think it was that bad, and it didnt really bothered me..besides is not that the quality of the sound is bad, i just didnt like it..you may think the oposite so i will give an 8 on here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8.8) - I like some of the characters, especially abel, but the others arent much worse. They are well develloped and thats good, some of them also look cool, 9.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.2) - I enjoyed it, it worth the time i spent watching. There are a lot of moments where there is almost no action, but action moments are also in great number in this anime, and that makes the anime much more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.4) - An 8 close to 9, describes an anime that i consider very good and that i recommend to all that like action. At last worth a look, you may not like it, but you may also find a good way to spend your time.\\n\\n\r\nsry about my english if there is some mistakes, i tryed my best, i hope you understand ;)",

            "content": "This anime had a whole lot of potential. It has all the right elements for any avid vampire or action junky. Sure, it steals some things from Vash (especially toward the beginning when Abel is half goofy klutz half amazing vampire hunter) and also several things from Hellsing but that in itself would of been just fine. \r\nMy main problem with this anime is the fight scenes. Everytime, what could be, a epic fight scene comes up they do a few blows then immediately switch scenes, half the time never showing what happened. This happens in basically every good battle. \r\nAnother issue, is they seemedafraid to push the envelope. For example, without spoilers, someone bleeding profusely only for them to be fine a few minutes later.  ______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI Liked the animation in Trinity Blood. It's nothing too fancy, but personally I dislike anime that tries to distract you with beautiful visuals. Certain scenes had great detail and the character design was superb. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nMost of the time I hate the music in animes. There are very few exceptions, but this is one of them. They seemed to match up the soundtrack very well to the mood of the individual scenes. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis was the animes strongest suit. After watching it completely, I'm sure that if the character development and interactions between different characters weren't so enjoyable, I'd of never finished. \\n\r\nThe main character, Abel Nightroad, was fun to watch every single episode. You never knew what he was going to do next. They also did very well with the scenes between Abel and his \"friends\". The scenes with Abel and his \"Tovarish\" were especially compelling.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI did enjoy this series, but it was certainly a big let down in many ways, as I stated above. However, due to the great character development, above average comedic elements, and decent storyline, I still liked it.\\n\r\nI imagine reading the manga would answer many things, but I feel as if animes need to be made viewer friendly. As if the manga doesn't exist in the viewers world.",

            "content": "Okay, this anime gave me the impression of when you're like driving your car on a nice sunny day on a nice straight road then suddenly something came across your path and you go off road and it gets bumpy you dunno where you're going and then somehow manage to come back on the right track again. Yeah that kind of feeling.\r\nThe fact is, this anime was close to perfection, given the scenarios and the plot, the back story of some characters especially for father Abel is very strong and interesting, like wow, this character is BADASS! But... i don't really like how he turnedout to be. So much for my expectations huh? I was hoping for another Van Hellsing or a Dante version kind of vibe. But oh well, it doesn't matter, i still like how he turned out to be, to be a priest and taken a vow not to kill anyone in order for him to atone for his sins is cool, there is nothing wrong with that right? But the problem is, he is sometimes useless or rather, the hero is not suited to be called a hero, why? Because he is off timing (this is the part where the hero should pop up and save the day!) if only \"they\" made use of him properly and timed his entry of execution and badass exit, even his clumsy attitude would be overlooked or rather add to his charm but what's happening is quite the opposite everywhere he goes for a mission i'm sure you noticed, yeah, more people die when he's around, is that what you call a vow to protect? For me it's pure BS. The only character that really caught my attention was the \"SWORD DANCER\" now that's what you call a HERO in disguise, yeah let the sword speak yeah.\\n\\n\r\nI was expecting alot of action and more drama from this, but what a disappointment this is. I'm giving it a 7/10 i kinda like the humor that's all.",

            "content": "I am going to state this as simply as possible. When I review anime, a 7 is a 70% which means the anime was average but nothing special. I noticed most people would say that was worth a 5, or a 50%, but that is an F. If an anime didn't have any obvious flaws other than being nothing special, then I don't think it failed. So please read my reviews with this in mind. This is why most of my ratings seem on the high end. If I enjoyed it enough to finish it, it should be getting a C, not any lower.\r\nTrinity bloodis a very solid anime with good characters and an interesting story.  I was tempted to rate the anime higher, but in the end I would say that Trinity Blood is good, but not too much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nStory(7/10)\\n\r\nThough the story was good, it wasn't particularly original. There is a vampire empire, there is the Vatican, there are political disputes. It all works well together, but the themes and background aren't exactly original. Watching this also reveals a lot of similarities to Trigun's story line and concepts.\\n\\n\r\nArt(6/10)\\n\r\nThere isn't too much to say here. The animation is good, and certainly won't bother you. However, it has aged quite a bit. I wish it had chosen more of a style, other than a very generic art. \\n\\n\r\nSound(6/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is nice, but sometimes feels somewhat random or repetitive. It seems like there are only four or five songs. In the end, the sound falls short for failing to be memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10)\\n\r\nI would say that the characters are the strongest piece of Trinity Blood. The develop well over the episodes, and are generally enjoyable. I can't think of any character that I outright disliked and wished wasn't there. For the most part, the characters are well rounded; they have enough backstory to feel important, but not so much that the series felt like watching flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(7/10)\\n\r\nDefinitely worth your watch, if nothing else. The engaging story and characters really make this one interesting. There was enough action to be entertaining, but enough dialogue to flesh out the story. I just wish there were a few more episodes at the end to explain what happened, and what the results of the final battle were.\\n\\n\r\nTrinity Blood is a very solid anime, pulling inspiration from Hellsing and Trigun. It was a nice watch that wasn't too heavy, but wasn't too light, if you know what I mean. I recommend this to anyone who likes Vampires, politics, or action. Like many of the other anime I have reviewed, I do not recommend this to anyone who expects their world to change after watching this. I would also say if you are easily bored by dialogue, this isn't for you.",

            "content": "Trinity Blood is at this moment of writing eleven years old, and a lot has changed in the world since the days this anime aired. In fact, this anime aired a year after Fullmetal Alchemist and Ghost in the Shell aried on Adult Swim and in its own year saw series like Speed Grapher, Blood+, Shakugan no Shana, and Rozen Maiden to name a few series of the time. Watching Trinity Blood was truly like viewing a time machine, for I found myself constantly admiring little tropes in the writing and how characters acted or expressed themselves that modern anime either doesn't do or justdo like anime did some ten years ago. That is not to say that Trinity Blood is superior to modern anime by any means, but even still, there are things to take note of and enjoy of a series from this time.\\n\\n\r\nLet me get this out of the way though, yes Trinity Blood in its writing rips off Hellsing and Trigun with the same shame that DOOM (the 1991 video game) has musical cues ripped from popular metal songs. But just because something rips off those two works doesn't mean that the series is inherently flawed or terrible. Off the top of my head, Trinity Blood would have been a far worse ripoff about a vampire who doesn't like killing traveling on a desert planet while getting occasional orders from his female superior as he tries to maybe find his brother and atone for his sins (or something). That's one example I can come off my head. Looking at Trinity Blood from its own perspective, it's a series set in a distant future where the Earth riddled itself with nuclear warfare in a war for new found longevity. The series focuses on people who are trying to keep the peace between mankind and the Methuselah (what vampires refer to themselves as) who now inhabit the Earth.\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, let us examine Trinity Blood a little further. Trinity Blood is originally adapted from a light novel by Sunao Yoshida, who died just a year before the very release of this anime. Due to Yoshida's death, Trinity Blood is fated to have some issues arise from this situation, mainly in being adapted from an incomplete story and partly from just being a light novel adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThe story overall is nicely told, though there is an episode or two early on that feel sorely out of place and could have been handled differently than what we find ourselves with. There are also some issues I feel with the way the anime explains its setting. There simply isn't enough for the average viewer to get on the first or second watch and would require some extensive research outside of the anime as to what is even going on in the series in the first place. I wonder if this was a purposeful tactic though just to spring interest in the novels for those who have questions of the anime. Or if the anime was made in such a rush that this was considered okay.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art honestly swaps between fantastic to highly noticeable issues. I didn't particularly see a lot of errors, but I did see some usage of CGI that was noticeable and just not at all appealing. Further, when the vampires moved at high speeds, they would be given this sort of after image effect that just looked cheap. Speaking of which, there are moments in many action scenes where character movement feels more like someone moved the character frame by frame across the scene, rather than individually draw their movements, leading to a floaty feeling from time to time. The worse offender though comes towards the end, where during the action, we zoom in on a characters hand. Only, they don't animate this, so you get a literal zoom into the pixels and a cut to a drawn close up. This is either just a lazy decision, the result of a troubled production, or just a flat out badly thought out idea. But even then, the art and animation is still particularly good, even when it makes a mistake here and there.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music and general sound, it's alright stuff. The music either sets the tone well or really gets the blood pumping for an action scene. If I may take a moment, the opening song Dress from Buck-Tick was originally made in 1993 and is a particularly good choice of music for the series. However, the ending song is just dreadful with some of the worst Engrish you will ever hear and possibly some of the worst singing I could ever allow myself to harm my ears with. I don't even know what anyone was thinking with this decision, but they use another such song during the anime as an insert song and it was just torture. I don't know if this is just a case that the production staff didn't know enough English to know that this was grating to the ears or something, but someone should have spoken up at the first moment this was all suggested and just said no to it. The only thing as bad as this is when they got Mari Iijima to do the English voice work for the English dub of SDF Macross, and that was just embarrassing.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if I may take a moment towards the end here to be more general, the series strength is in its writing. It's action is quite lacking really and leaves you yearning for more than what it gives you. This is a shame then, because most times you feel like a grand spectacle of a fight is going to break out, but it doesn't. Abel Nightroad simply dispatches all of his problems without fail. A fight simply ends far too quickly or without satisfying resolution. But on the other hand, this series does a superb job in setting up the satisfying moment when Abel or the like just comes out and reveals the true nature of themselves and just absolutely wipes whatever smile was on their opponents face, not too unlike how Alucard does so in two early fights where he just comes back at his opponent with a force they never imagined.\\n\\n\r\nThe series greater strength is in its writing. At all times I watch this series, I find myself immersed in this world and everything about it, yearning to learn more about it and watching characters interact with the world. It really is a shame that this series ended the way it does though as it leaves me with a continued want for more and a dissatisfaction not to dissimilar to those coming from the ending of either Hellsing (the TV Anime) or Black Blood Brothers.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, anyone who makes comparisons of this series to Hellsing, especially in this day and age, may need a history check. At the time this series was airing, the only Hellsing anime to exist was the thirteen episode TV series, the Ultimate series wouldn't come about until a year later. The original Hellsing anime was not at all a fantastic spectacle that the Ultimate series was. Sure, there are many cases where the anime was better than what we get in Trinity Blood, but not by much honestly.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Abel Nightroad is such a one trick pony in his spectacle that it does get boring to see him do the same thing over and over again. Alucard though? Alucard was always finding a way to kill his opponent in some spectacular manner, constantly topping himself off with the violence he brought to you. It is such a shame then, cause Abel could have possibly reached such heights, or even any other character, but the anime never took the liberties to allow for such fights to happen, and so we get a series of energy blasts and light shows.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, we have Trinity Blood as a small relic of the past. While it isn't the most ground breaking anime you will watch, I think it is worth some viewing value. It has aged remarkably well over the years, its art still holds a candle to a lot of modern anime, and it's story, while horribly flawed, is better than so many light novel adaptations created today.\\n\\n\r\nI can't recommend this series as a vampire anime though, nor can I recommend it as an action series, nor can I recommend it alone on story. But I do recommend at least giving this series at least one watch. At least one, with an open mind and considering the series on its own merit.",

It sort of assumes that the viewer has already read and manga and/or the novels. I've watched TB with many of my friends and in almost every episode I have had to explain to them what is happening - Why is an episode called \"the Iblis\" when they never explain what theIblis is? Why is Abel a Crusnik? Why is the world in the state that it is? What's with the flashback scenes? Etc, etc. Also the pacing is sort of off - an episode full of action will be followed by an episode of nothing but political intrigue and sitting around talking. I give Story a 7 if only because it is somewhat inaccessable to new viewers, possibly to the point of frustration if you don't know what's going on, and also for the pacing issues.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound are very good so I give them both 9. The art is beautiful (except for the stupid CG, which there is thankfully not much of), the music is great, and if you're watching the English dub, the voices are actually not bad at all (except Ion...  *shudders*)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter gets a 10. Lots of character development throughout the show. I've heard Abel is similar to Vash, so if you like Vash you may like him as well. Most all of the characters are complex and interesting. Even many of those that seem flat at the start later reveal many sides to themselves. I think that is my favorite thing about this anime, how even minor characters grow and develop as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment gets a 9 from me. However, I predict most people would enjoy it at maybe an 8 (or possibly a 7) level, which is why I rate it overall 8. It's a great story and generally underappreciated, but I do understand that it's quite inaccessable unless you already know the backstory. So my suggestion is this: Read a synopsis of the backstory first, then watch the anime. Better yet, read the manga or the novels first. Trinity Blood is best enjoyed as a unit (manga, novels, and anime) rather than as just an anime. All three of the storylines are slightly different, each adds its own dimension to the world. As a stand-alone anime TB is pretty good, but taken with the other works it is amazing!",

            "content": "Reviewer's brief notables:  If you're a fan of the Trigun series, Trinity Blood just might be the next best thing.\r\n______________________________________________________________\r\nStory:\r\nThere are several things in the story that, I believe, need to be included into the current synopsis. There are many key details that viewers must acknowledge to fully appreciate the story behind Trinity Blood.\r\nIn the series' current setting, there are two forces: the Terran (Human) and the Methuselah (Vampire). The story is based 500 years after the Armageddon in the future of Europe. The anime does carry much of European architectural design and also displays many notable landmarks that are found in Europe presently.\\n\r\nThe Terran population is more resembled upon civilized life presently. They have a monarch approach of government rule that is highly organized and nobly respected. As it seems to the story, the Roman Catholic Church is the foundation of the political and martial power of the Terran including the presence of a Pope. The Terran force is also referred to as the Vaticans.\\n\\n\r\nThe Methuselah population was once human. At a time, there was an outbreak of a virus infecting human beings. The virus would feed on the host's blood cells until they deplete. Soon after, they thirst for more blood to keep themselves alive. Symptoms of the virus include the mutation of their genetic makeup and also to latent superhuman abilities that varies between hosts. With the crave for blood and newfound abilities, they are commonly and ironically called Vampires.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the Vatican and the Methuselah forces are engaging an ongoing war. Both of these races have the same motive: to eliminate the opposing race. This does not relate to everybody though. There is a resistance group that wants the Terran and Methuselah to coexist in harmony. This group being called, &quot;Ax&quot;. The members of &quot;Ax&quot; include very aristocratic individuals from both sides of the field.\\n\\n\r\n      As for the real story review, I think this anime has outdone itself. Trinity Blood has a very rich and deep plotline that is very consistent and also very engaging. Trinity Blood reveals an ample amount of information for its 26 episode season, but is also simple to understand. There are two things that I have to complain about. First being how there are several plot holes in the season about Abel's past and identity. Second, being what I feel, an incomplete ending. It seems as this anime, though ironically, pushes an abundant amount of information at you, and yet seems to slip some of the more significant essence. If excluding that setback, I'd say this series is nearly perfect.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n     I truly like Trinity Blood's style of animation. The style is mostly seen in more action-oriented genres, like Trigun, but possibly a step better in quality. For the animation, there is nothing really to complain about. On the other hand, the CG behind Trinity Blood is quite terrible. For its time in production, I'd expect far better CG. The CG looked very edgy and choppy--also looks, and feels like it doesn't belong with the standard animation. Being that, I give the Art an Eight out of Ten.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n     The introductory song to each episode fit in nicely with the opening animation and the overall feel of the anime. Nicely done. The music scores in this anime are nicely done as well. The music was very appropriate at each scene. I gave the Sound portion an Eight because in some instances in the series, the background music was overplaying the voices of the characters, especially during sensitive and important scenes where the characters talk in a soft manner. It just seemed to really bother me.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n     The main character in this anime, Abel Nighroad, is much like and often compared to Vash the Stampede of the anime, Trigun. They both are very cooperative and kind also somewhat of a pacifist. They also have refused to kill any human at any point of time. They have a lust for food; Abel being tea with 13 spoons of sugar and Vash being of donuts. Also, the two characters have very devastating capabilities with immeasurable potential.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, there is some MAJOR character development. Possibly taking up most of the series itself. There are several flashbacks and isolated thinking scenes that reveal much more of the characters. I personally, was swept up by almost all of the characters which made me have their upmost support.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is, what I think, the real strongpoint of this anime. It is possible the very thing that had me hooked to this anime.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n     I can't say that you won't enjoy this series if you're not ready to see some very gory violence (blood, severed limbs, decapitation). Though with all the violence, it really makes Trinity Blood more engaging and much deeper. It's just not the same without it. Trinity Blood is one of the very few series' where I can freely just literally shout at my computer all my many emotions that go on throughout the series. Very engaging indeed. As I've mentioned, or along the lines of, the enjoyment factor is upon the character development--well, for me it is. I would say that I would enjoy this series much more if it had a second season to cap off some of the missing links in the series.",

            "content": "\"Trinity Blood\" is basically the most esoteric term for \"shitty plagiarism\" ever concocted. It's the name given to a series about a bipolar four-eyed immortal space vampire and his gaggle of irrelevant friends on their quest to get to the end of a story where the author was killed before he had a chance to end it. Why was he killed? Hellsing and Trigun were raking in lots of money at the time and their authors caught wind of some douche stealing their ideas and peddling it to stupid girls by plastering shoujo art all over them. In this writing I will explain every reasonto avoid the remnants of that fanfiction-writing hack's life.\\n\\n\r\nReason Alpha: What's on the Screen.\\n\\n\r\nThis animated fanfic stars Vashucard, member of the Heavensing organization. She's a bumbling doofus with glasses who kills no humans, but murders vampires. When she gets mad, she spouts out some babble about releasing safety locks and restrictions, and turns into a drill-haired dame with lipstick and fangs. Joining him are a mary sue in a nun outfit, robo-Piccolo and some other guys you won't remember because they're only relevant for one episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd those episodes are the only good ones. The fanfic starts by introducing semi-enjoyable characters(aside from the terrible main duo) in one-shot episodes that are never referenced or called back to again. After that 90 or so minutes of collective entertainment, you're stuck watching some shittilly-paced crossover story about absolutely nothing, with no conclusion. At the end, the viewer gains nothing but the bare minimum of visual entertainment. They walk away with no morals learned or memories of good presentation and writing. It's a completely worthless, ephemeral experience that lasts 12 hours.\\n\\n\r\nI wish there was more to dissect or rant about, but there really isn't. I could talk about how Vashucard's back story is the same as Vash the Stampede's, or how the series ends the same way Hellsing(the first anime, the bad one) did with random resurrections and shit that never mattered, but then maybe I'd be flagged for spoiling the writings of some dead ass with the imagination of a 11-year old girl? I could talk about the endless camera pan shots and fade-ins that draw in the eyes of girls looking for pretty-colored bishounen, or badly choreographed and unsubstantial amount of action the fanfic offers, but those are self-explanatory.\\n\\n\r\nReason Omega: What's not on the Screen.\\n\\n\r\nHave you seen Hellsing? Have you seen Hellsing Ultimate? Have you read Hellsing? Have you watched Trigun? Have you read Trigun? Have you seen or read the dozens of other mediocre vampire shoujo anime and manga that are better than this? How about all them vampire action movies with actual action? If you answered no to any of those questions, fix it instead of watching this. If you answered yes to all of the previous questions, then only watch this to have \"that one piece of shit\" on your list.

            "content": "I first heard about trinity blood on a forum in the summer of last year. Not too much detail was given except for the small facts that it had vampires and a group of super soldiers working for the Catholic Church fighting against each other. Slightly intrigued I started browsing the web to research it a bit more, before I decided to watch it. During that research I found this description on the back story.\r\n\u2018When Earth's population drastically increased, humanity was led by the United Nations attempt to colonize Mars. During the colonization, they discovered two alien technologies: the Bacillus and the Crusnik nanomachines. Thecolonists installed the Bacillus in their bodies which transformed them into Methuselahs. Continuing wars on Earth eventually led to \"Armageddon,\" the apocalyptic event that happened 900 years before the start of the story, and the colonists returned to Earth to help with rebuilding. However, when the colonists returned to Earth, a war broke out between the Methuselahs and the humans who had remained on earth.\u2019\\n\\n\r\nThis prologue was the main reason I decided to watch Trinity blood. Not only did it explain how vampires came into existence but why humans are at war with them. On top of that my favorite studio Gonzo was the creator.  \\n\\n\r\nI went into the first episode with excitement and for the most part I found the first episode very entertaining and fun to watch. The story follows a man named Abel Nightroad, a member of the Vatican and an AX agent trained to kill vampires. While traveling on a airship back to the capitol the ship is attacked and over taken by a pure blood vampire. Nightroad confronts the vampire on top of the airship where he shows his true form, a Crusnik, a being that feasts on vampire blood. This transformation is awesome on every sense of the word and I left that first episode with good feeling.   The artwork was beautifully gothic and dark, setting the mood perfectly. The english dub was decent (as you aspect from funimation) and the main character had a split personality and was interesting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI left that first tale in the series with high optimism and excitement for the remaining 23 episodes. Want followed was some of the most inconsistent story arcs I have ever seen. The series hit a break wall already in the early episodes. It had become so boring with too much text and not enough action or development happing. I was thinking of the dropping the show around the fifth episode when out of no where I would get the awesome action packed episode I was looking for. Then straight after, the show would be back to boring text episodes where nothing happens. It seemed for every great episode I watched, 2 crap ones immediately followed, and the cycle would continue like that.     \\n\\n\r\nThe show also suffered from lack of development for the supporting characters. \\n\r\nWe are finally introduced to other AX agents who have great potential to be developed characters and they are barely in it. \\n\\n\r\nFor its faults there was something about Trinity blood that made me keep watching. It maybe because I got into a routine of seating through the pointless episodes, because I new, in the back of my head that soon there will be a kick ass episode right round the corner. And I was right.\\n\\n\r\nThe series had its strong points for sure. The soundtrack was haunting and fantastic along with the character designs being extremely cool. The development on the main character is also one of the highest points of the show. Half the fun of the series is figuring him out and his back story is revealed bit by bit making you want to keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to any one who digs vampires or who needs an action fix. But be warned it\u2019s not for everyone, a series like this needs attention and above all patents. You need to bear through the bad, to get to the good\\n",

I figured, it'd be better in action, right?\r\nWrong.\r\nThe anime starts out completly random, which could be forgiven, but it entirely ignores the cardinal rule of anime by explaining the basics by at least the end of the second episode. This leaves the viewer completly and utterly lost.\r\nThe first episode starts with an adventure on a plane, then the second one jumps to when he's at the church. If I didn't know whatwas going on via manga, I'd be so confused. They don't bother to explain why he's working for the the church, how he got there after the plane incident, and who the robot guy is. It just jumps in and expects you to know.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, all of the episodes have absolutly no relation to each other AT ALL. Except for when it says Part 1 and Part 2, each episode could take place anywhere in the series.\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: Go manga on this one.",

I forced myself to see it until the end and i can see now that it have the most NONSENSE episodes never seen.\r\nWhy? Let me explain few things.\r\n-ATTENTION: MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS(not on the main story)-\r\n1)Abel < Vash\r\nSomeone says that Abel is the bad copy of Vash(Trigun Anime). Well it's true, but very very the worst copy seen. In one episode he stated that i had promise(in the past) to not kill no one else. Well in the first episode he kill a vampire telling \"you are been executed\". Inanother episode airships are attacking a city with a big tank drove by a bad guy. Like often happen, he get mad and oneshot everything. \\n\\n\r\n2)Immortal enemies\\n\r\nThe WORST thing in an anime. They had been shotted, exploded, cutted and? They are still here. Ok Dietrich can use dead body BUT THAT BODY WAS EXPLODED WITH THE TANK! The vampire woman that abduct the witch girl was kicked by \"Demon-Abel\"; now you are a kick-ass freaking demon: if you want kill someone you SHOULD KILL HIM and if you don't want kill him you should take him to prison but NOOO!! Surprise and ambush! She is still alive! I never expected this!\\n\\n\r\n3)Non-sense plot\\n\r\nRadu burn the palace where Lady Caterina hoping that the Vaticano will kill Ion. Ion come back wounded and what he does? He aid him and save his life. Later he go to prepare the boat: 10 mins to take a gun and come back. Perfect time to let Esther and Ion talk a LOT. It was already the dead body? So why the hell he should suffer the wounds?! Just kill Ion! This is only an example, a lot of scenes are non-sense only to show useless things (like the vampire woman revenge only to show that the robot have \"feelings\")\\n\\n\r\n4)The best scene\\n\r\nDemon-Abel hit hard Isaak Fernand etc etc. He is on the ground heavily wounded. When Abel miss his target he just say \"It's time to go\", stand up and disappear. A THAT KIND wound SUPPOSE that you cannot move easily but he just stand up and disappear in one second (the disappear skill is like a teleport because no one in the all Vaticano caught him).\\n\\n\r\nThis anime's fans will forgive me. It is nice, but only for who doesn't expect a TRUE story from it.\\n",

            "content": "First of all, I will say that I did not watch Trigun before seeing this. This I say because most people will tell you that this is a ripoff of Trigun. I have not seen it at this point, so I do not know.\r\n___________________________________________________________________\r\nPrologue:\r\n The anime was a great one, if you are a fan of action this has plenty of it, if you want drama this has plenty of it, if you are a fan of vampires this has plenty of it, if you are a fan of sci-fi this has plenty of it (no mechas though), and last of all if you enjoyhistory and some political fiction this has plenty of it. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I really enjoyed the allusion to historical empires and political ideologies present in the anime. For example: The New Human Empire (aka Empire of the True Race / Methuselah Empire) is very influenced by the Ottoman Empire, going as far as to have the Imperial Janissaries do the same job they did in the actual Empire, being the household guard of the Emperor (Empress, in the case of the anime) that and a mix of the earlier Byzantine Empire which was succeeded by the Ottoman Empire. Vatican is representative of the EU, and an allusion to the medieval Christian philosophies of the Roman Catholic Church. Albion is, I believe, the modern England adapted into the anime controlling only the British Isles at this point as well as being neutral in the Vatican - Empire tensions. Also, being born in Istanbul and spending the first 5 years of my life there (as well as many visits) I can say Istanbul was very nicely adapted into the Byzantium of the anime, which is the capital of the Empire as it was in the Ottoman Empire. Hell, even the parts of the city are accurately portrayed!\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I did not like about the anime was, it does not give much background information at all... The story is perfect! But the only thing the anime tells you is that there is a conflict between Vampires and Terrans and that this leads to tensions between the Vatican and the Empire. For this I had to read various sources to get information about the background, which might have led me to enjoy the anime fully. However, I really hesitated giving this a 10 because of that, had it portrayed the background nicely I would not have even thought of any other score. \\n\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is perfect! However, if you are reading this I suggest that you do not become discouraged by the length and keep on reading as I will be telling much of the points of the story that I wish were told at the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nAt one point in the history of Earth, humans colonized Mars. And the colonists discovered two types of nanomachines there left by an earlier civilization: the Bacillus and the Crusnik. They subsequently injected the nanomachines, and those with the Bacillus were turned into the Methuselah, or as termed by normal humans (called Terrans by the Methuselah) into vampires. However, those with Crusnik installed into them do not live, except for four, who are Abel, Cain, Seth and Lilith.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the colonists returned to Earth, a war broke out between the Methuselahs and the humans who had remained on earth. Abel, Cain, and Seth took the Methuselah's side&mdash;while Lilith supported the humans' side. The continuing war eventually led to &quot;Armageddon,&quot; the apocalyptic event that happened 900 years before the start of the story. During the war, Cain went insane and killed Lilith. In grief, Abel took her body to the Vatican where she was buried. Abel remained at her side, weeping for her, for 900 years.\\n\\n\r\nAt the start of the story, there is an uneasy truce between the Methuselah and the Terrans. The Roman Catholic Church is a major military power determined to protect humans from the Methuselahs, with its seat of power based in the Vatican. The Methuselahs have their capital of Byzantium, which is surrounded by a field of particles to filter out UV radiation, protecting the Methuselah population.  However, the Methuselah have an Empress that wishes for peace, and the Vatican is reluctant to start hostilities against the Empire because the Empire is the most technologically advanced nation on earth, with weapons and machines that surpass both the Vatican arsenal and Albion.\\n\\n\r\nBoth groups use &quot;lost technologies,&quot; such as airships, missiles, and computers, to engage in a cold war with one another. A third great power, Albion also plays a role in the war with its superior arsenal of lost technology and weapons and higher level of manufacturing ability versus the Vatican. The independent monarchy of Albion is a primarily human country, however the secret of their expertise in lost technology is found in the Ghetto, an underground city of enslaved Methuselah. It is these Methuselah who operate and manufacture the lost technology, but with the death of the Albion Queen, some of the enslaved vampires begin a rebellion for the freedom of all of the Ghetto residents.\\n\\n\r\nLast of all, Crusniks are beings that drink the blood of Methuselah, while the Methuselah are beings likened to vampires because of their superior strength, agility, prolonged life span, regenerative traits and their inability to be exposed to the sun (as the nanomachines would burn the host) together with their weakness to silver and their necessity to regularly drink human blood because the nanomachines are constantly destroying their red blood cells. They can have children, and they can eat normal food.\\n\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art / animation is good as it is not an old anime. The blurry-ish look really gets one into the story's dramatic and tragic tones. The way the faces of each character is drawn also hints at their respective character personalities. Also, the facial movements and eye effects truly reflect the mood of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe color choices used in the anime are really good for the atmosphere of the overall plot.\\n\\n\r\nOther than those, there is not much I can say about the animation as it is not really an old anime.\\n\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and the ED were both really good, even when I did not really want to spend much time I could not stop myself from watching / listening them.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sounds used in the anime really help in setting the atmosphere of the moment. Especially I paid attention to it at the final episode where it really fit in with what was going on. There is no other way that I can describe that than saying it was &quot;Epic&quot;. \\n\\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI was actually kinda disappointed as there were no special characters like, say Lelouch, in this anime. They were all rather typical characters, you know, the guy with the tragic past (who I think over exaggerated it), the whiny-yet-nice-so-you-cant-get-mad-at girl, the little aristocrat boy who falls in love with a commoner and can't bring himself to say so, the best friend who betrays but then comes back in the end as he is about to kill his helpless best bud, the empress in disguise, the fanatically loyal guy who goes mad with his loyalty only to realize his mistake at the end... etc.\\n\\n\r\nSo the characters are all ones used in previous works with not much originality other than their adaptation into the awesome storyline of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series, however the enjoyment at the beginning was limited due to the frequent plot changes at the first few episodes and the storyline that was not efficiently given at all.\\n\\n\r\nLater on though, after the involvement of Esther into the plotline, the enjoyment increased as I started seeing political conspiracies, fanaticism, ideologies, and tragedy... of course not forgetting the epic action scenes which were really good btw.\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nAlthough due to the lack of information about the background storyline at the beginning, I really hesitated giving this show such a high score, I could not help but do so knowing the actual storyline and having finished the series together with the ending. \\n\\n\r\nI really hope they would make a continuation of the story, as after properly knowing the storyline the series is truly a masterpiece quality one. That is of course in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless I highly recommend this anime, and I REALLY REALLY want to point out that you SHOULD DEFINITELY READ ABOUT THE BACKGROUND STORY BEFORE STARTING THE SHOW!!! What I wrote about the background story in the story section should be sufficient, although of course knowing more doesn't hurt ;).",

What makes me particularly sad about this series is that it had potential to be distinguishing and as good as Hellsing or Blood+ but it does earn a moniker in my worst anime list as a \"number 2.\" The talent behind the art and the voice acting especially from funimation that gives us Fullmetal Alchemist and the Samurai 7 dubs, were all wasted in this god-awful mess of a show. Thelargest gapping problem for me at least is that the show sincerely focused on geo-politics yet they little focused on vampirism. Was there some tears to the script. Plus the characterizations were just flat or just embarrassing for example I found Ester to be very attractive but then she must have this emotional attachment to an obnoxious retard named Abel. That is much I can remember from Trinity Blood because when I am writing this, I just got back from watching There Will Be Blood. Even that had more Blood than this piece of poo.",

Classic Vampire-Human drama and all that would encompass such with a amazing twist.  A Japanese \"what if tale\" about the \"Vatican\" church, and all of it's not-so-known enforcers.  (If only that we're really the case, how much cooler a religion would be.)  I am happy to say that there aren't many filler episodes within this series, which is great.  I love a hard-written story driven anime, and this one has that for sure hands down.\r\nArt (8) - Only have seeing atotal of three anime series now, I would say this was nothing all that spectacular.  It was indeed, just very good.  Nothing was hard to make out, all of the backgrounds, character designs, both futuristic and or medieval was done very well.  I will note one thing that did stand out, the weapon of Abel Nightroad was quite possibly the single coolest melee weapon I've yet to ever see in any genre. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9) - Well, as a new review-er.  It was hard to pick a favorite for this series, at first it was Tres, in the end however I would have to go with Caterina Sforza, being a large part of the show herself, she had a very commanding presence and always brought a light to the situation at hand.  As for the rest of the cast, all was quite brilliant, each character possessing a particular skill that was either distinct and/or original.  The only reason why it didn't earn a (10) was due to some of the childish like behavior from Abel Nightroad, I found it to be a tad over-done considering the role of him.  Well, and...  Who doesn't love a Crusnik... I mean seriously...\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9) - For the lover of Vampires-Humans in a \"plot-vs-plot\" but not sure what's-what.  Does that make sense to you?  Strong storyline, great character inter-personal relationships, hardly any filler episodes.  Mysterious Crusnik Vampire class.  A great series that won't make you feel bad for not going to church!",

            "content": "Last week I talked about Gonzo with a look at Final Fantasy- Unlimited. This week we have another Gonzo anime with Trinity Blood. The series began as a series of light novels by the now deceased Yoshida Sunao. It was adapted into a manga that's still ongoing and into this anime which aired in 2005. Let's take a look at it and see how Gonzo did with this one.\r\nStory:\r\nIn some indeterminate time in the future, humanity has changed. We're separated into two basic types. The ordinary humans of today, called Terrans and the vampiric Methuselah. There's a territorial; divide with a lot of western Europebeing Terran controlled & eastern Europe being Methuselah with some neutral nations acting as a buffer. Unfortunately, the uneasy peace is being threatened by the Rosenkreuz Order. It's up to Father Abel Nightroad and his comrades at the Vatican to put an end to their machinations.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with this series is a simple one. Virtually everything that happens in it is really obvious and predictable. Because this story doesn't so much put twists on clich\u00e9s to make it its own as run down the list and pick all the ones it likes to just throw in completely true to form. And this is a point I've made before, a good writer can use unoriginal ideas and turn them into something unique. Terry Pratchett did it with his personification of Death. Miyabe Miyuki did it with a story about a boy transported to another world, even if the Brave Story film was bollocks, the novel did a really stellar job with it. But an unskilled writer will just toss every over done, tired, generic plot point they can into their work and it just comes across as trite. Which is what happens here. I'll give some examples but I won't name names because I don't want to spoil a lot. There's a bit where the series makes sure to point out something unusual on one of the female characters and the obvious place to go with it is that she's actually royalty or something and that's why that's there. Which is exactly where the series goes with it. There's also a minor character death where everything leading up to it is stuff that would typically come before a character's death. There's a sudden focus on their relationship with the protagonist, they're having a bonding experience and then they get separated and go off into a dangerous situation and you know that character isn't coming back. The one thing that might have been surprising is spoiled in the ending theme tune & even then you know where they're going to eventually go with it. There's just nothing that happens narratively that actually surprises or engages you. Maybe they would if this was one of your first action anime but if you've seen a decent number, this is all old hat.\\n\\n\r\nThey also seem to have \u201cborrowed\u201d a lot of ideas from Trigun. Except that they were a lot better executed in that series. And this isn't like Hunter x Hunter where some things were clearly inspired by Dragonball but they were modified into something unique to that series. This is a lot more copy-pasted. Also, what kind of a surname is \u201cNightroad\u201d for a vampire. That would be like having a witch with the surname Hexe.... I redact the name criticism immediately.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest pity is that this series did have potential. The idea of vampires and humans openly living side by side but in a state of unease could have been really interesting. The execution is just tepid and ends up spoiling the concept.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast suffers from the same issue as the story. They're just really archetypical and uninteresting as a consequence. Father Nightroad is that variety of shounen protagonist who's powerful but kind of goofy and hiding a tragic back story. Think of a super watered down version of Vash the Stampede without any of those elements that make Vash compelling. Then we have Sister Esther. She's the super pure, kind and supportive girl who isn't too good in a fight but tries her best. The prickly action girl with a kind side role is taken by Astharoshe.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art varies. The cityscapes tend to be pretty good. Some of the futuristic technology looks cool. The character designs are a bit plain, but work. Except for Father Nightroad's transformed version. He looks like a Goth kid is trying to make themselves look \u201cdark & brooding\u201d but the youngster in question has no sense of subtlety so they way overdo it. He also has hair that sticks up in a way that makes the super saiyajins look subdued. To think, those five gallons of hair gel could've been used to spike the hair of a hundred idiot frat boys. Even his weapon looks absurd. The cg doesn't always mesh well with the rest of the artwork either. The wings look really out of place, there are times when you'll get a bit of technology that clashes with everything around it. Some of the more outlandish attacks look awkward. The action sequences as a whole aren't very good. They're kind of lazily done.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe acting in this is pretty good. Which isn't surprising with a cast that includes such names as Noto Mamiko, Touchi Hiroki & Honda Takako. I don't think it really challenged any of them since the characters are just flat tropes, but it's still good. Eguchi Takahito's music is decent enough.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThis doesn't really have any ho-yay. It has a good deal of het. I guess in this version of the future the Catholic church decided to lose the celibacy vows as a method of stopping the priests from touching children. Wouldn't it be great if the actual Catholic church did literally anything to try and stop that instead of just relocating the problem priests and pretending everything was fine?\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nI won't say that Trinity Blood is a bad anime. That being said, it certainly isn't good. It's a series that has a premise with a lot of potential but wastes it with a serious over-reliance on clich\u00e9s and, to make it a bit worse, it outright plagiarises content from Trigun. So, I'd suggest just watching Trigun instead. Because this series hasn't a single creative bone in its proverbial body. My final rating for Trinity Blood is going to be a 4/10. It's below average. Next week is Valentine's day, so let's look at something with a romantic bend. The review is going to be on Junjou Romantica. That seems like a good choice.",

            "content": "The story and characters in this series are fantastically enigmatic and complex.  Ultimately the characters and their relationships are as interesting as the overall plot line.  The biggest drawback to this series is that it ends without really explaining some important aspects of the story.  The lack of background throughout the series provides suspense and intrigue, but anyone who has not read the Manga will probably want to look up a synopsis of the plot at some point.  However, the series is definitely worth watching anyway.\r\nThe vampires are largely classical Braum Stokes in nature, though, there are a few interesting twistswhich crop up in the plot and backstory.   The ambience is dark and mysterious, giving the show a dramatic feel.  However, Abel\u2019s antics serve to lighten mood from time to time.  Abel displays many different faces throughout the series-though it seems they are all part of him rather than just masks he wears-providing his character depth not easily achieved in the typical conflicted protagonist role.  Abel\u2019s dorkiness is endearing and is necessary to balance the more serious and painful reality of his past and his current mission.  \\n\\n\r\nThe change that comes over Abel when he releases into his fighting modes is shocking.  He becomes horrible and beautiful, valiant and creepy, powerful and weak.  While his essential shape remains the same, the change in his hair and eyes is chilling.  That Able becomes terrible in his fighting form while the enemy of the world goes from charismatic in his human form to angelic in his fighting form is an appropriate archetype for real life.  Abel\u2019s form is honest to its own nature, while the success of the antagonist is largely due to his devious nature.  He is a master at showing others what they want to see until they are no longer useful to his own purposes.\\n\\n\r\nThough there are some obvious similarities between Abel and the main character in Trigun, the feel of this series is vastly different.  Enough so, that the two series don\u2019t target the same audience.  Where Trigun is often lighthearted and silly, Trinity Blood\u2019s plot weighs heavily as it addresses a variety of social and personal conflict issues.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Trinity Blood is an intriguing story which draws the viewer in both through the overriding plot and through the depth of the characters and their own personal struggles.   However, the series should have been extended to include an explanation to the history of events which propelled the world into the current state of affairs.    Instead viewers are forced to look to other sources for any resolution to the story.\\n",

            "content": "Two races form in the fallout of a world war \u0096 humans and vampires (humans who evolved from colonies on Mars) \u0096 and maintain a fragile truce. However, both sides have enemies who would break the truce and enable their respective race subjugate or annihilate the other. It takes the intervention of Abel Nightroad, a super-vampire far beyond either race, to ensure peace between both races.\r\nThis show stands out from the standard vampire anime for being a space opera. The story is a grand and epic tale, combining elements of sci-fi, horror, political intrigue, drama and even a touch of humour. The use of religiousterms/themes makes this an intriguing and intricate story to explore. The characters are well-written and have interesting background and characterization to explore, and their voice actors are well-chosen (Troy Baker in particular is wonderful as the complex protagonist Abel). And the art is magnificently ornate and expressive, capturing the baroque world and its engaging characters in a stunning format.\\n\\n\r\nThe story lasted only one season, though. It was dealt a heavy blow by the untimely passing of writer Sunao Yoshida, and though the comic continued the story it didn't really feel right; the anime had to end where it did. It's a tragically underrated and incomplete anime. Also the show tends to draw influence from other shows (TRIGUN, TO TERRA, HELLSING, VAMPIRE HUNTER D); it's only a side- effect of the incredibly abundant anime industry, but these inevitable comparisons can take away from how unique and wonderful the show is.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, it's a very intricate and ornate anime that would have turned out to be one of the greatest vampire stories ever told, had fate been kinder to it.",

            "content": "Vampires have been in the media for a long time. Everything ranging from the 1900s till today. But vampires today are not at all what they were years ago. vampires today are sugar coated diamond gay boys that prefer to hook up with young girls that are 1000s of years younger than them (im looking at you twilight). So as you can imagine, walking into a show such as trinity blood was either going to be a hit or miss. To sum it up before you read the rest of this; i enjoyed the hell out of this show. \r\nIll try and keep this reviewas short and straight to the point as possible.\\n\\n\r\n~STORY~\\n\\n\r\nThe story for this show is actually pretty good. in this world lives vampires and humans (obviously). The two species are at the brink of war with each other and it's up to the church to take power and try to resolve the issues and prevent war. As the story progresses though we learn of things such as each sides motives and the \"enemy of the world\". Theirs alot more to this story, but explaining it would treed on spoiler territory.\\n\\n\r\n~ART~\\n\\n\r\nBeing that this show was made back in 2005 ill admit that there are some flaws. However though, this show looks really good. The action scenes and transformations were eye candy and kept you interested till the end. at least it was for me anyway.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\\n\r\nOther than the OP and ED, i can't say that there were many tracks that stood out. Don't get me wrong, the music fit the over all tone of the show and defiantly shined when needed. But there were no songs that I can say were amazing and tell you to go buy the OST. The music is good, but not amazing.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nI think this is both the strongest but weakest point of the show. The main characters got alot of time, development, and connection that had me admire the characters. But the antagonist and side characters didnt get much to it. Some of the side characters never really changed though the show, which is unfortunate but hey, what are you going to do?\\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~\\n\\n\r\nThis show was alot of fun. the show reminded me alot of trigun for reasons that im not willing to explain. It had alot of action, good characters, humor,  and a story that kept me guessing at times. This show is not for everyone, but if you enjoy a somewhat dark shows, vampires, or trigun, There is a really good chance you will love this show. \\n\\n\r\nHowever I would advise you to stream the show before you buy. I advise this because the show is not for everyone, as mentioned. Also there is ALOT of religious references in this show. I dont know how people feel about religious context in there shows, if your not a fan of it...at least stream it, It's still a fun show.",

            "content": "I definitely understand the mixed receivings of \u201cTrinity Blood\u201d. It has a lot of potential, but many times come out as very confusing and incoherent. It also has been accused of copying other work such as Hellsing, something which I must disagree with. Yes, Trinity Blood for shore contains a lot of the same elements as Hellsing, for example a powerful organization (the Vatican) fighting methuselah (vampires), the guns, and having their own trump card in the form of a more powerful being (a krusnik) that drinks the blood of other vampires. Which in my opinion is concepts that gladly can be used again andagain, due to that form of plot are exciting to me. And the execution of Trinity Blood\u00b4s story and the overall feeling is nothing Hellsing, both shows have their own specific touch to it. Worth knowing is that the novel/manga was still ongoing at the time the anime was made, so a satisfying conclusion will be absent in the end. Hence, I will make some comparisons between the manga and the anime in my review.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what was Trinity Blood good attributes and what was it lacking in my opinion? Let\u00b4s get down to that now shall we.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nThe story takes place in an alternative setting of Europe in a distant future. 1000 years ago, Armageddon accrued, and vampires came to exist on earth and the modern technology (called lost technology) was lost in the events. Ever sense, humans (Terrans) and vampires (Methuselah) has been at each other\u2019s throats. Prejudices and fear won\u00b4t let the two races to coexist in peace. The Vatican\u00b4s department of foreign affairs task is to take care of any problem related to vampires, led by cardinal Caterina Sfroza. The division is called AX, and includes some of the elite fighters and agents within the Vatican. \\n\\n\r\nDuring a mission, Father Abel Nightroad encounter the young sister Esther Blanchett, and after her adopted family is murdered by the city\u00b4s ruling vampire, she accompanies him to the Vatican to train and become a team member of the AX. But something is stirring in the shadows, an organization called the Rozencreuz has started to make their move for a world war between the Terrans and Methuselah, and let their leader to take the place as the worlds almighty ruler. \\n\\n\r\nI actually really like the base plot a lot. Powerful organizations fighting each other for different goals, vampires and humans on the brink of war, a bit a revenge quests, and a super powerful being that drinks vampires blood. What\u00b4s not to like! So why a 6 you may ask? Because, as I mentioned before, Trinity Blood\u00b4s story many times comes out as confusing and incoherent. Sometimes I felt like I most have missed like 3 episodes or something, much do to with unexplained major time skips in the story, or missing explanations regarding terms, characters, and important plot devices. Also, what was to be believed important plot events and for shore would have a huge impact on the overall story, was left behind end never mentioned again. Or characters that are introduced are just dumped somewhere and are absent for most of the remaining plot, for them to just show up at convenient moments. That left me very confused at times, so the overall enjoyment was dragged down. The pacing could also be very uneven. A couple of action and information filled episodes could be followed by some very slow and very uninformative ones. \\n\\n\r\nAfter reading about 70% of the manga, I can see the root to these problems. I don\u00b4t know yet if the manga follows true to the novel, but the manga definitely make so much more sense than the anime. The manga is also much more enjoyable, I rate that one a 9 so far. It seems that the anime version of Trinity Blood takes several different routes, and are making a couple of anime original arcs. The anime version is still keeping the main plot as a base, but does several things differently and leave somethings unexplained and unexplored, which makes the whole experience kind of confusing and incoherent. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also has a little Sci-Fi touch, which I after read the manga actually enjoying quite a bit. But in the anime, it was mostly confusing and just added more questions. Of course, as in many story\u00b4s, the mystery elements are one of the alluring aspects, but since the anime was so incoherent and in many aspects uninformative, and never got a sequel... Well, the mystery aspect became more of a confusion factor. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story is kind of dark and tragic, but more light-hearted and comical scenes are also present \u2013 mostly in the form of Father Abel\u00b4s clumsy and specific persona. These moments are a lot funnier and fitting in the manga then in the anime, at least I think so. When some action occurs, it\u00b4s often pretty great. Then you hear \u201cKrusnik, 40% release approved\u201d, you now shit is about to get real.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, the story does have its good parts that really pulled me in, and let me become interested and intrigued. Hence why I started to read the manga, and boy I\u00b4m I glad I did that!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI actually really enjoyed the art. It differs slightly from the manga\u00b4s art, which I liked even more. I would not go so far as call it super unique, but it do has something that make it stand out. Studio Gonzo is the studio behind Trinity Blood, and for the time it was produced (2005) I must say that they did a good job. The characters have long lean bodies, and both men and women have beautiful features. The colour palette is not particularly anime vivid or depressingly dark either. More light and bright colours are used the more light-hearted scenes, and darker colours are used in the more serious scenes (Yay, me to state obvious things). It\u00b4s suites the mood of the show, and are adapted to the atmosphere of a specific scene. I most complement the light setting in the show, it\u2019s almost always spot on, and letting the characters and the environment shin in the same light. I made it feel like the characters always belonged in the environment. The backgrounds are beautiful and detailed, for example a city silhouette or garden. Always a pleasure to look at.  \\n\\n\r\nFor the animation, its good but nothing really outstanding either. Few weird and jerky movements, with an all over smooth feeling to it. The action scenes are nicely done, but are no masterpieces either. Not much CG has been used, and that which has been used are used in a nice manor. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI personally aren\u00b4t a fan of both the OP and the ED. Both felt to slow and boring to me to really suite the show, which has a darker theme. I skipped both after heard them a couple of times. For the OST, it was much better. Dramatical orchestra music during for the action and more serious scenes, and some guitar pieces for the more calm or light-hearted scenes. Absolutely to my liking.\\n\\n\r\nBackground sounds and such, was always on par with what happened on the screen and did its job to highlight an event. \\n\\n\r\nFor the VA\u00b4s (dubbed), I think all did their job very well. The voices matched their characters and often managed to bring out their personality. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nOnce again, I feel like so much potential was lost. Like, I didn\u00b4t even realize that Esther was one of the main characters until I read the manga. She\u00b4s handled in such a way that she could have been the cute side character love interest to Abel, and not the main heroine. Again, here\u00b4s the problems with the different routes the anime chooses to take, Esther\u00b4s development and importance to the plot is completely overshadowed. Her warm, badass and quite funny personality never really came to life in this adaption. Same can be said about Tres (the machine who only serves Caterina). In the manga, he is an important character, and despite being an artificially made human, he has a lot of characterization and development.  \\n\\n\r\nBut I must say that I like all the characters, it\u2019s just that I feel that they weren\u00b4t used to their full potential. Trinity Blood for shore contains a lot of cool, likable and interesting characters. And to my delight many badass female characters is present. Such as the almighty cardinal Caterina, the powerful methuselah Asta-san, and the mysterious girl Seth. All great characters that are pretty fleshed out even in the show. Most of the characters, even the villains, are given specific and intriguing personalities, so at least I would not call them boring or waste of space. Some fill up their role in the show great, and other just feel like random inputs, which never happens in the manga.  \\n\\n\r\nAs far as character development goes, it also limited by these alternative routes. Abel has in the manga together with Esther a wonderful development. And that development comes together with the plot of the manga, in the show he mostly stays the same. The sweet and heart-warming moments he and Esther shares are also very reduced in the show. Abel hides his fears and agony behind this goofy and clumsy persona. He has a dark past, which are slightly explored in the show. Bits and pieces of his past is given, but not at all to give the whole picture. He sees himself as \u201cthe enemy of all humans\u201d, and lives only to repay for the sins he\u00b4s made. The part Esther is playing in Abel\u00b4s embrace of some parts of his past is undermined in the adaption as well, but here they do manage to portray some of Esther\u00b4s importance to Abel, and that she reminds him of someone important to him that he lost long ago. \\n\\n\r\nThe decision to take different routes and cut out some important parts, leave the feeling of somewhat incomplete characters. Not one- or two-dimensional, but just that - incomplete and lacking in something.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nIt may sound from all my whining in this review, that I didn\u00b4t enjoy myself watching this piece, which is wrong. I did enjoy it quite a bit, even if I many times was somewhat confused. I love vampire vs. human story\u00b4s and as a plot base Trinity Blood has a great one! Action, mysteries, a bit a blooming romance, super power and fantasy is some of my favourite genres, and even do the adaption was done in a poorly manor these bits still shined for me. It made me pick up the manga, and for that I\u00b4m always going to be grateful for. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nAbsolutely, worth the watch for me. I love the genres and always crave more vampire story\u00b4s like this. The alternative routes, cut out of important information, limited character development, and a inconclusive ending dragged the score down for me. The thing is that I had soooo many questions during the show that never was answered. Like, how did Abel become a krusnik, and what is krusnik really? What was the Mars project? And what released the Armageddon and why? Hence, I picked up the manga. So, I would recommend the anime Trinity Blood to all of you that like vampire story\u00b4s and can put up with being confused and not getting all your question answered in the end. Because, the art and animation was quite good, so the watch will bring something new. I would recommend Trinity Blood the manga even more, the characters are awesome, the plot is intriguing and exciting, and the art is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nHope you find this rant of a review somewhat helpful and informative!

It starts with a priest, called Abel Nightroad and is job is to solve the problems with vampires for the church. At some point the story turns to the negotiations between the church and the empire, where most of the vampires live. But here is a group that wants to create a war between the church and the empire, to bring destruction to the world,  and for that they do everything to interferein the peace talks. I wont tell you the result, if you want to know watch it ;).\\n\\n\r\nArt (8.6) - I liked it. Character design, ambience design also good, graphics also look good.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7.5) - Just enough to not make this anime worse just because of this aspect. I didnt like it at all, but i dont think it was that bad, and it didnt really bothered me..besides is not that the quality of the sound is bad, i just didnt like it..you may think the oposite so i will give an 8 on here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8.8) - I like some of the characters, especially abel, but the others arent much worse. They are well develloped and thats good, some of them also look cool, 9.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.2) - I enjoyed it, it worth the time i spent watching. There are a lot of moments where there is almost no action, but action moments are also in great number in this anime, and that makes the anime much more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.4) - An 8 close to 9, describes an anime that i consider very good and that i recommend to all that like action. At last worth a look, you may not like it, but you may also find a good way to spend your time.\\n\\n\r\nsry about my english if there is some mistakes, i tryed my best, i hope you understand ;)",

            "content": "This anime had a whole lot of potential. It has all the right elements for any avid vampire or action junky. Sure, it steals some things from Vash (especially toward the beginning when Abel is half goofy klutz half amazing vampire hunter) and also several things from Hellsing but that in itself would of been just fine. \r\nMy main problem with this anime is the fight scenes. Everytime, what could be, a epic fight scene comes up they do a few blows then immediately switch scenes, half the time never showing what happened. This happens in basically every good battle. \r\nAnother issue, is they seemedafraid to push the envelope. For example, without spoilers, someone bleeding profusely only for them to be fine a few minutes later.  ______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI Liked the animation in Trinity Blood. It's nothing too fancy, but personally I dislike anime that tries to distract you with beautiful visuals. Certain scenes had great detail and the character design was superb. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nMost of the time I hate the music in animes. There are very few exceptions, but this is one of them. They seemed to match up the soundtrack very well to the mood of the individual scenes. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis was the animes strongest suit. After watching it completely, I'm sure that if the character development and interactions between different characters weren't so enjoyable, I'd of never finished. \\n\r\nThe main character, Abel Nightroad, was fun to watch every single episode. You never knew what he was going to do next. They also did very well with the scenes between Abel and his \"friends\". The scenes with Abel and his \"Tovarish\" were especially compelling.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI did enjoy this series, but it was certainly a big let down in many ways, as I stated above. However, due to the great character development, above average comedic elements, and decent storyline, I still liked it.\\n\r\nI imagine reading the manga would answer many things, but I feel as if animes need to be made viewer friendly. As if the manga doesn't exist in the viewers world.",

Yeah that kind of feeling.\r\nThe fact is, this anime was close to perfection, given the scenarios and the plot, the back story of some characters especially for father Abel is very strong and interesting, like wow, this character is BADASS! But... i don't really like how he turnedout to be. So much for my expectations huh? I was hoping for another Van Hellsing or a Dante version kind of vibe. But oh well, it doesn't matter, i still like how he turned out to be, to be a priest and taken a vow not to kill anyone in order for him to atone for his sins is cool, there is nothing wrong with that right? But the problem is, he is sometimes useless or rather, the hero is not suited to be called a hero, why? Because he is off timing (this is the part where the hero should pop up and save the day!) if only \"they\" made use of him properly and timed his entry of execution and badass exit, even his clumsy attitude would be overlooked or rather add to his charm but what's happening is quite the opposite everywhere he goes for a mission i'm sure you noticed, yeah, more people die when he's around, is that what you call a vow to protect? For me it's pure BS. The only character that really caught my attention was the \"SWORD DANCER\" now that's what you call a HERO in disguise, yeah let the sword speak yeah.\\n\\n\r\nI was expecting alot of action and more drama from this, but what a disappointment this is. I'm giving it a 7/10 i kinda like the humor that's all.",

            "content": "I am going to state this as simply as possible. When I review anime, a 7 is a 70% which means the anime was average but nothing special. I noticed most people would say that was worth a 5, or a 50%, but that is an F. If an anime didn't have any obvious flaws other than being nothing special, then I don't think it failed. So please read my reviews with this in mind. This is why most of my ratings seem on the high end. If I enjoyed it enough to finish it, it should be getting a C, not any lower.\r\nTrinity bloodis a very solid anime with good characters and an interesting story.  I was tempted to rate the anime higher, but in the end I would say that Trinity Blood is good, but not too much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nStory(7/10)\\n\r\nThough the story was good, it wasn't particularly original. There is a vampire empire, there is the Vatican, there are political disputes. It all works well together, but the themes and background aren't exactly original. Watching this also reveals a lot of similarities to Trigun's story line and concepts.\\n\\n\r\nArt(6/10)\\n\r\nThere isn't too much to say here. The animation is good, and certainly won't bother you. However, it has aged quite a bit. I wish it had chosen more of a style, other than a very generic art. \\n\\n\r\nSound(6/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is nice, but sometimes feels somewhat random or repetitive. It seems like there are only four or five songs. In the end, the sound falls short for failing to be memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10)\\n\r\nI would say that the characters are the strongest piece of Trinity Blood. The develop well over the episodes, and are generally enjoyable. I can't think of any character that I outright disliked and wished wasn't there. For the most part, the characters are well rounded; they have enough backstory to feel important, but not so much that the series felt like watching flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(7/10)\\n\r\nDefinitely worth your watch, if nothing else. The engaging story and characters really make this one interesting. There was enough action to be entertaining, but enough dialogue to flesh out the story. I just wish there were a few more episodes at the end to explain what happened, and what the results of the final battle were.\\n\\n\r\nTrinity Blood is a very solid anime, pulling inspiration from Hellsing and Trigun. It was a nice watch that wasn't too heavy, but wasn't too light, if you know what I mean. I recommend this to anyone who likes Vampires, politics, or action. Like many of the other anime I have reviewed, I do not recommend this to anyone who expects their world to change after watching this. I would also say if you are easily bored by dialogue, this isn't for you.",

            "content": "Trinity Blood is at this moment of writing eleven years old, and a lot has changed in the world since the days this anime aired. In fact, this anime aired a year after Fullmetal Alchemist and Ghost in the Shell aried on Adult Swim and in its own year saw series like Speed Grapher, Blood+, Shakugan no Shana, and Rozen Maiden to name a few series of the time. Watching Trinity Blood was truly like viewing a time machine, for I found myself constantly admiring little tropes in the writing and how characters acted or expressed themselves that modern anime either doesn't do or justdo like anime did some ten years ago. That is not to say that Trinity Blood is superior to modern anime by any means, but even still, there are things to take note of and enjoy of a series from this time.\\n\\n\r\nLet me get this out of the way though, yes Trinity Blood in its writing rips off Hellsing and Trigun with the same shame that DOOM (the 1991 video game) has musical cues ripped from popular metal songs. But just because something rips off those two works doesn't mean that the series is inherently flawed or terrible. Off the top of my head, Trinity Blood would have been a far worse ripoff about a vampire who doesn't like killing traveling on a desert planet while getting occasional orders from his female superior as he tries to maybe find his brother and atone for his sins (or something). That's one example I can come off my head. Looking at Trinity Blood from its own perspective, it's a series set in a distant future where the Earth riddled itself with nuclear warfare in a war for new found longevity. The series focuses on people who are trying to keep the peace between mankind and the Methuselah (what vampires refer to themselves as) who now inhabit the Earth.\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, let us examine Trinity Blood a little further. Trinity Blood is originally adapted from a light novel by Sunao Yoshida, who died just a year before the very release of this anime. Due to Yoshida's death, Trinity Blood is fated to have some issues arise from this situation, mainly in being adapted from an incomplete story and partly from just being a light novel adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThe story overall is nicely told, though there is an episode or two early on that feel sorely out of place and could have been handled differently than what we find ourselves with. There are also some issues I feel with the way the anime explains its setting. There simply isn't enough for the average viewer to get on the first or second watch and would require some extensive research outside of the anime as to what is even going on in the series in the first place. I wonder if this was a purposeful tactic though just to spring interest in the novels for those who have questions of the anime. Or if the anime was made in such a rush that this was considered okay.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art honestly swaps between fantastic to highly noticeable issues. I didn't particularly see a lot of errors, but I did see some usage of CGI that was noticeable and just not at all appealing. Further, when the vampires moved at high speeds, they would be given this sort of after image effect that just looked cheap. Speaking of which, there are moments in many action scenes where character movement feels more like someone moved the character frame by frame across the scene, rather than individually draw their movements, leading to a floaty feeling from time to time. The worse offender though comes towards the end, where during the action, we zoom in on a characters hand. Only, they don't animate this, so you get a literal zoom into the pixels and a cut to a drawn close up. This is either just a lazy decision, the result of a troubled production, or just a flat out badly thought out idea. But even then, the art and animation is still particularly good, even when it makes a mistake here and there.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music and general sound, it's alright stuff. The music either sets the tone well or really gets the blood pumping for an action scene. If I may take a moment, the opening song Dress from Buck-Tick was originally made in 1993 and is a particularly good choice of music for the series. However, the ending song is just dreadful with some of the worst Engrish you will ever hear and possibly some of the worst singing I could ever allow myself to harm my ears with. I don't even know what anyone was thinking with this decision, but they use another such song during the anime as an insert song and it was just torture. I don't know if this is just a case that the production staff didn't know enough English to know that this was grating to the ears or something, but someone should have spoken up at the first moment this was all suggested and just said no to it. The only thing as bad as this is when they got Mari Iijima to do the English voice work for the English dub of SDF Macross, and that was just embarrassing.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if I may take a moment towards the end here to be more general, the series strength is in its writing. It's action is quite lacking really and leaves you yearning for more than what it gives you. This is a shame then, because most times you feel like a grand spectacle of a fight is going to break out, but it doesn't. Abel Nightroad simply dispatches all of his problems without fail. A fight simply ends far too quickly or without satisfying resolution. But on the other hand, this series does a superb job in setting up the satisfying moment when Abel or the like just comes out and reveals the true nature of themselves and just absolutely wipes whatever smile was on their opponents face, not too unlike how Alucard does so in two early fights where he just comes back at his opponent with a force they never imagined.\\n\\n\r\nThe series greater strength is in its writing. At all times I watch this series, I find myself immersed in this world and everything about it, yearning to learn more about it and watching characters interact with the world. It really is a shame that this series ended the way it does though as it leaves me with a continued want for more and a dissatisfaction not to dissimilar to those coming from the ending of either Hellsing (the TV Anime) or Black Blood Brothers.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, anyone who makes comparisons of this series to Hellsing, especially in this day and age, may need a history check. At the time this series was airing, the only Hellsing anime to exist was the thirteen episode TV series, the Ultimate series wouldn't come about until a year later. The original Hellsing anime was not at all a fantastic spectacle that the Ultimate series was. Sure, there are many cases where the anime was better than what we get in Trinity Blood, but not by much honestly.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Abel Nightroad is such a one trick pony in his spectacle that it does get boring to see him do the same thing over and over again. Alucard though? Alucard was always finding a way to kill his opponent in some spectacular manner, constantly topping himself off with the violence he brought to you. It is such a shame then, cause Abel could have possibly reached such heights, or even any other character, but the anime never took the liberties to allow for such fights to happen, and so we get a series of energy blasts and light shows.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, we have Trinity Blood as a small relic of the past. While it isn't the most ground breaking anime you will watch, I think it is worth some viewing value. It has aged remarkably well over the years, its art still holds a candle to a lot of modern anime, and it's story, while horribly flawed, is better than so many light novel adaptations created today.\\n\\n\r\nI can't recommend this series as a vampire anime though, nor can I recommend it as an action series, nor can I recommend it alone on story. But I do recommend at least giving this series at least one watch. At least one, with an open mind and considering the series on its own merit.",

            "content": "SPOILER ALERTS:\r\nFirst off, I cannot understand how anyone watching this series does not completely agree with the fact that this IS A COMPLETE TRIGUN RIPOFF. How so? \r\nThe story's protagonist, Abel Nightroad, is EXACTLY like Trigun's protagonist, Vash the Stampede. Both characters are completely goofy and act aloof, but this is merely a rouse in order to fool those around them into thinking that they are not competent fighters. Additionally this is done so that those around them feel safe and as though they are not in any danger when with them. However, when both characters need to be, they are EXTREMELY able and strongcombatants. Both characters have virtually the same back stories. Vash is a genetic experiment who has superhuman abilities, and Abel is a genetic experiment with superhuman abilities. Both characters originate on a spaceship/station due to issues on the original Earth such as overpopulation or war. Both characters are immortal. Both characters have one goal in mind, and that's to find their identical twin brother and kill them, but in the process, protect as many people as possible while taking vows to never kill anyone again (other than their respective enemy brothers).\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, both series mention \"lost technologies\" and are in post-apocalyptic futures where conventional technology has been lost and the world has had to rebuild.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, though I noted the unbelievably ridiculous similarities between both shows, I still did not mind, because Trinity Blood had a slightly different spin to it, using the whole vampire genre as a way to bridge the gap; fine. BUT, they really did not focus on vampires at all. Sure they showed the occasional fangs here and there, but the only real episode where they showed a vampire feed on a human was the FIRST episode, and that's pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, such as the AX priests, were all very interesting characters who were SET UP to be excellent additions to the show, but alas, they were never expanded on. You never saw the back stories of ANY of the other priests or side characters, all the while, the series writers' constantly made references to the character's back story's that the audience could never be expected to understand. For instance, one priest says, while fighting in an intense battle, \"If I can't get through this, I'll never be able to face my daughter.\" However, this is one of the last episodes in the series, and up until this point, the audience has never even been told that this priest had a daughter, and nor will it ever be mentioned again. Similarly, this exact same priest, when first debuted in the anime, is shown to be in prison where Abel is consulting him on a case he is working on. The priest responds by saying \"So how many years off my sentence?\" After that, we never see this priest again in a prison setting nor are we told why he is in prison in the first place or how he is now out. We can assume he did something bad, and since he is a valuable fighter, he is allowed out to help with missions, but that's simply that: an assumption. \\n\\n\r\nThere were numerous other characters, such as Father Tres, the cyborg \"Gunslinger,\" who I'm sure must have a very interesting story, along with the other priests, but we are never told.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion of the series ends horribly abruptly, and simply makes the case that the war is still ongoing between the brothers. I've read that the manga explains in more detail, however the original light novels that the series first originated from, the manga, and the anime, are ALL different, with different plot lines, story arc conclusions, and sometimes, even different or lack of characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this series has amazing potential, which is why I trudged through it, but I was sorely disappointed and would not recommend anyone watching it. Also, I thought the music was really bland.",

            "content": "As an Anime Trinity Blood has received some criticism that it rips off other anime's and it's rather story is rather bland. I disagree with the first, to say that you would have to accuse hundreds of other anime's for the same thing,( e.g: Hoop Days from Slam Dunk.) There are always going to be similar scenes and themes and characters that share a similar personality, it's kind of unfair to mark an anime down for that. Plus it doesn't help if the anime is made from the same studios that brought other popular and stunning anime.\r\nAs for the second i somewhat partially agree toit, it's not bland, it is just not explored.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story is set the distant future after the destruction brought about by Armageddon. Set 900 years after an apocalyptic war between humans and vampires, the series focuses on the on-going cold war between the Vatican and the Empire. Fighting on the Vatican's side is Abel Nightroad, a Crusnik which feeds on vampires. some in the Vatican and the Empire strive for peace, other factions will do anything to stop it, Vatican has to rely on other allies to counter the situation. \\n\\n\r\nso it's not your typical Vampire story of humans versus vampires in a struggle for survival or whatever, after the war some peoples of both sides desire peace others believe there should be war and the main antagonist and his faction of the series are trying to to star a war, the story focuses, on the main protagonist and other main characters in their attempt to stop a war for happening a work for a peaceful future. so it's not a complete rip off, of Hellsing or anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problems with the story is that it lacks some originality, the whole vampire theme and some of its story outlines have been done before, and that in the Anime it is not as explored as deeply or as thoroughly as it should have been. It mainly shows the characters and their interactions with others and their relationships, their own personal conflicts, their missions etc. in short it doesn't really show the bigger picture, and the anime assumes you have read the Manga and Novels, so it leaves a lot out.\\n\\n\r\nhowever it does give a good blend of sci-fi, fantasy, political intrigue, drama and horror. So the it can't be written off completely. i rate the story at 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is animated by Gonzo and going by Gonzo's works it is done extremely well, very impressive looking with stylish and vibrant looks for the characters in their clothing,  varied character designs, and also good detail on other minor characters, they are not left as bland as they are in other anime's they still look pretty sharp so it doesn't ruin the whole thing, the whole thing is very eye catching, excellent CG enhanced backgrounds, brilliant fight scenes. The quality does lessen a bit in some scenes though and though there is varied character designs, some can complain that a few of the female character's would look the same if you changed the hair and eye colour for this reason i rate it at 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for the anime is done really good, excellent sound effects for various things, good theme musics to help with the drama of the scene, i'm not too keen on the opening song, but thats down to preference really, i enjoyed the ending theme though had great sound to it. Unlike many anime's Trinity Blood has a got a really good English dub, the voices fit with most of the characters well some of the voices i really didn't like and for the opening theme sound rated at 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the story are well done and also interesting, and show a lot of development, always a strong point in anime. The main protagonist in the anime, Abel Nightroad, is quite similar and often compared to Vash the Stampede from the Trigun series, and with good reason, they both have goofy and kind also somewhat  pacifistic nature, they also have refused to kill unless in extreme situations that is beyond their control and they are always sad at the loss of a life, all of this is also hiding a rather highly intelligent and a powerful being, also hiding the fact that neither are human. They both have MASSIVE appetites, shown to eat great amounts of food, rather quickly. most consider this a rip off, but i think its more of a tribute or parody if not more of a coincidence, it is definitely not the first time i have seen a character that is similar to Vash.\\n\\n\r\nMost major developments of characters come from the two main protagonists Abel and Esther Blanchett, Abel showing how he deals with his own conflicts and dilemma's etc, Esther is shown to mature quite a bit and does have quite a lot of plot relevance, almost as much as Abel does.\\n\\n\r\nThe other major developments come from the Methuselah(vampires) Asta and Ion, who are shown to let go of their prejudice's against humans.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, all the character's play their part well and add their bit to the story, probably most of the Anime is taken up by showing the character developments, even some of the minor character's grow and develop, character development is a strong point in Anime however it probably spends a little too much time on them hence, it does not get into the story as deeply as it should. i rate character's at 9.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the Anime i loved it, great characters and visuals with good quality all the way through and a good story into the bargain, Trinity Blood deserves a little more credit than it is generally given, I understand that some probably won't like it, but you really need to read the Manga to understand it better and certainly need to read the Novels to get the full background story of the series.\\n\r\n There are difference's between all three of them (Anime/Manga/Novels) each telling it slightly differently. As an Anime on it's own i would give the Anime an 8 overall, but after reading the novel's and Manga i would give it a 9 overall since i understood the background and story better, i would loved to have given this anime a 10 overall but the way the Anime tells the story kind of marks it down a bit, it also has similar and it ended quickly (24 episode season) if it had another season or a few OVA's that could fill in the gaps it would be better, so overall i rate the Trinity Blood Anime at 9.\\n\\n\r\nstill considering i stumbled across the anime completely by accident, that score is pretty good. Read the Manga's and Novels to get a better story, after reading them, i re-watched the series and enjoyed it a lot more. Even on it's own it's still well worth watching.\\n",

I don't have much to say about it, but enough to make my opinion known.\r\nStory - 7\r\nThis is a good story, don't misjudge my 7. The reason I knock the score down is the poorly told story. \r\nThe story IS there, and its a good one! My issue is how it folds out. I understand making a confusing plot line and wrapping it all up by the end. However this is not the case. Yes, it wraps up the story, however very, very, very, slowly and still confusing. \r\nI was completely lost on thestory. Events happening early on in the series seem like \"A New Adventure Every Episode!\" kind of situation. \\n\r\nIn reality they weren't, and to realize this, you need the important info revealed at the almost end of the series, but wait, we won't be specific enough, so it still raises some questions... Just to find out that the piece of missing info was revealed earlier on in the series.\\n\r\nI had to look up the general plot by the end of watching the show to clear up everything.\\n\r\nBroken up score\\n\r\nPlotline - 9\\n\r\nUnfolding the story - 4\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nThis is some of the best artwork I have ever seen in an anime. Very pleasing to the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nThe sound track is a hit or miss.\\n\r\nSound effects are fine.\\n\r\nVoice acting is a hit or miss with some characters (Dubs).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7\\n\r\nDecent back stories, but this also falls in the story telling part too. Character back histories are poorly revealed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall its worth a watch or 2. While the story IS good. Its not revealed good.

            "content": "Trinity Blood fails in almost every respect. It doesn\u2019t start like this though, it actually starts pretty good. The world is neat, the plot looks like it will go to cool places, and the two main characters, Esther Blanchett (a nun whose church has been destroyed by vampires) and Abel (a priest who works for the Vatican and fights vampires) are totally likeable. We\u2019ll get to flaws in their characters as the show progresses later on, but all I can say here in the intro is that it starts off promising, so promising, but ends in failure.\r\nStory\r\nThe story, as stated, starts with promise. The warbetween the Vatican and vampires seems pretty cool and the world the fights take place in is pretty damn awesome. But then about the point where little fairy children called Tinkerbells show up, the series degrades into stupidity, terrible pacing and plotting, and things pop up out of nowhere. For example, toward the end (this isn\u2019t really a spoiler) Abel\u2019s sister explains that their brother is still alive (news to me). This suddenly leads Abel to go after his brother who shows up for the next four or five episodes of the series, despite never being mentioned or showing up at any other time. Nothing is even insinuated before a major plot point happens, it just happens and is shoved in your face. While this may be trying to be surprising, it fails horribly because it is so groan worthy and the characters act so unrealistically toward the plot point.Just watch the last episode where the series tries hard to explain the terrible story arc, but falls apart  due to terrible unrealistic actions of characters and no back story or anything to tell us what is going to happen or what has happened. We don\u2019t even understand why Abel and his brother are fighting.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the stupidest parts of the plot is that Abel can\u2019t kill anyone (despite killing someone in the first episode). It means really awesome fight scenes degrade into crying and idiocy. Not that there are very many fight scenes in the series, and none are memorable. Even the final fight is totally worthless.\\n\\n\r\nAnd more plot holes appear throughout concerning Abel. He mentions he can\u2019t swim in one episode after he fell off a cliff and swam to safety in a previous. It\u2019s small things like this that make you wish for something more. It starts promising\u2014so damn promising\u2014but sucks so badly. It gets really bad when a little vampire noble is introduced. Suddenly a romance blossoms between Esther and him, and there is even a point where the story is interrupted by a music video-esque scene of the two looking out a window. It\u2019s so out of place and stupid.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nThe animation is not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it\u2019s not good. Characters don\u2019t look too great, while environments typically look fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe main theme is pretty good until the end when it sounds like two or three people are singing it out of synch. The end theme is okay. The music for the show itself is bad, not even likeable. It sounds like the music out of a bad JRPG, like when you are in a town in Final Fantasy or something. The voice actors are competent, though none are outstanding in the least.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nFather Abel is Vash from Trigun. One moment a blubbering idiot who can\u2019t stop eating, the next a total badass. Even the plot is like Trigun with brothers from space fighting each other on a post apocalyptic Earth. Not that Abel is a bad character, he could actually be likeable if it weren\u2019t for the fact he\u2019s a total wuss and won\u2019t kill people. While Vash was like this and promoted the whole \u201cLove and Peace!\u201d thing Abel cries about violence and even in super awesome badass mode he becomes a huge crying wuss.\\n\\n\r\nSister Esther is likeable at first, but slowly over the course of the series you grow to dislike her more and more as the plot puts her more in focus as a typical anime girl who is trying to hard to help but always fails.\\n\\n\r\nThe vampire noble boy I mentioned before is the most annoying character in the series. He likes Esther when he must be five years younger than her. His voice is terrible and raspy. The series focus\u2019s on him toward the end and that\u2019s when the show degrades.\\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters are just there and are never anything more than two dimensional. One of the priests at one point before the final fight pulls a locket with his daughter\u2019s face on it out and says something about protecting her, which is news to me. I guess they were trying to add depth to the character, but it doesn\u2019t work and comes off as cheap and stupid.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nDon\u2019t waste your time with this series. I wish it were better because it had a lot of potential, but it degrades crazily over the course of it\u2019s 24 episodes. Once the plot moves into the vampire people\u2019s kingdom and their nobles and things like that, it becomes so boring and it\u2019s a chore just to watch. This is when the characters become groan worthy and everything becomes totally unlikeable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd after a terrible ending, not an ending like Big O that makes you think or something like that, just a plain old terrible/stupid ending, you feel like there is so much missing. Nothing has really been explained, characters motives are not explained, the backstory is hinted at, and I wish there would have been more of it because it actually sounds interesting, and there are still bad guys alive. While it feels incomplete, for me, I breathed a sigh of relief it was over. I enjoyed the first half immensely, but the last half was so bad and so awful that I can\u2019t even suggest the overall series.\\n\\n\r\nPass this one up.",

It had the potential to be good but failed to live up.  \r\nThe story seemed disjointed, I didn't feel like there was an overriding arc, just several arcs pasted together.  The best anime has both.  There were several whiny characters who were annoying.  And...melodramatic anyone?\r\nThe music was a bit overwhelming at times.\r\nOn the positive side, there were some good characters, Abel Nightroad in particular.  I wish the anime had delved a little more into the Mars/space aspect as in thelight novels.  \\n\\n\r\nI watched the torrent that included fansubs by Anime Empire, Conclave, mahou and Shinsen.  The subs were fine, very good, no problems.  Those are good groups anyway.  \\n\\n\r\nThe color palette for Trinity Blood was also, in my opinion, ugly.  There was nothing exceptional about the artwork overall.  The war zeppelins, and other battle machinery did look good.  Sometimes random objects or scenes stuck out as being pleasing, but they were the exception.  Not bad art in this anime, just not impressive or unique.\\n\\n\r\nI think this could have been a better story if they had drawn the light novels out beyond 24 episodes of anime. This could've really been good and I was interested in some of the backstory and canon that wasn't even touched upon in the anime.",

            "content": "This was introduced to me as a Catholic anime. Yes, a Catholic anime. I'm just as surprised as you are that that actually exists. Curious, I checked it out. Yes, I would actually call it a Catholic anime, but more than that it is a vampire anime. It's sort of like how Les Miserables is a musical first and a Catholic story second. But I actually prefer it this way. It's refreshing to see a show that is like many others except that it also happens to be Christian. I like that.\r\nBut anyway, the anime proper. Like Vampire Knight, this reminded me of the VampireChronicles, but whereas Vampire Knight was very small in scope, Trinity Blood is an epic, in the vein of Code Geass or Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and while it is not as good as those two, I still think it did a decent job. The main problem is that it is too short. Take the two other examples I listed: Code Geass and FMA: Brotherhood. Those have lengths of 50 and 64 episodes, respectively. Trinity Blood has a total of 24 episodes. It is not given enough time to properly flesh out the story, so the plot is dense at some points and rushed at some others. \\n\r\nWhile the plot isn't spectacular, the characters are pretty good. Our main character, Abel, is an endearing combination of a powerful warrior and total doofus. There are also plenty of good villains. \\n\r\nOverall, the best part of this story is its art. It is so romanticized that it goes past ridiculous and loops back to incredible again. Blacks, whites, and plenty of reds are used to stunning affect. \\n\r\nThis anime isn't for everybody, but if you like vampire stuff, or Catholic stuff, you should at least check it out.",

            "content": "This anime was almost totally awesome.  Almost....  It was a great storyline about vampires and humans living in a post-apocalyptic earth in the distant future.  What?! That is awesome!  The main character Abel was a bad-ass with a dark past of bad behavior (apparently) and a quirky split personalilty who wouldn't kill humans... who was kind of basically Vash from Trigun.  Yah, he isn't a human.  \r\nAlmost totally awesome!  But the ending and I had a bad break up, I mean basically there wasn't an ending at all, only a few disatissfying explanations.... This wasn't as bad assome anime, but as a warning for people that might want a real ending, this anime was the final straw for me and I was forced to come up with a fifth scoring element, it's called writers please make a plot with an ending, oh, I mean write a complete story, or, I mean I called it: \"ending/wrap up\".  TB gets a 3/10 in that category.  I know I know, the Manga explains it all, but I didn't read the Manga, so sorry for not knowing everything ahead of time.  I thought that was the point of a show, to give you plot details and make a story!  Not to make a show for the Manga reading audience and force everyone else to read wikipedia just to understand the storyline.  The explanation for Abel's super-vamp-destroyer-awesomeness went something like this: \"we were mars colonist\".  wtf? Well, actually nano-alien-technology turned us into these things (apparently).  I guess that makes his hair stand straight up when he gets mean??\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development could have been totally awesome too with some of the Vatican's AX vamp hunting peace keeping crew that Abel was on, but there wasn't much at all.  There are some flashback's into Abel's story that kept it interesting.  Also, the Esther character voiced by Colleen Clinkenbeard had a change of heart that counts as character development which was cool.  \\n\\n\r\nSo what was good about this Anime? The story was almost awesome.  If you like Vash with Vampires and some awesome action scenes and a few characters with cool powers thrown in with a disappointing ending, then watch it.  \\n\\n\r\nstory = 8/10\\n\r\nending/wrap up = 3/10\\n\r\nanimation = 7/10\\n\r\nmusic = 7/10\\n\r\ncharacters = 7/10",

            "content": "Synopsis: \r\nThe background is in the distant future, a post-apocalyptic world after the destruction brought about by Armageddon. The war between humans (Terran) and vampires (Methuselah) continues, as a struggle between two factions: the Vatican and the New Human Empire.\r\nYet, amidst the bloodshed and violence, many desire a peaceful co-existence between the two species. However, standing between them and this goal is the Rosenkreuz Orden, a group of vampire extremists who manipulate the two sides and pit them against each other. To combat them, the Vatican special operations group \"AX,\" led by Cardinal Caterina, must use everything they have - even a vampire who preyson the blood of other vampires.\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion:\\n\\n\r\nWell to be honest I really loved this anime. After see Hellsing I really got curious about Trinity blood. The theme was similar, so it picked up my interest. The story line is great, the art and characters too. I really got seduced by how the characters are carefully and meticulously draw. It was more smooth than Hellsing in my opinion what made it easy watchable ( I saw the 24 episodes in one night more or less.) I guess the only thing that disappointed me a bit was Esther role, she could have entered more in the anime and acted more. I liked how Ion gowned up and matured, he was a really good surprise in this anime. He can be a minor character but I totally love them. Regarding the Pope, I was expecting something different but it was so sweet and funny see him, however I was waiting for more development in his character.  \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is not that much original since there's many animes with similar story lines, however it stills interesting see Trinity blood and appreciate it completely because the story line itself is not too complex, so it's easy to understand the main story and the little sub-stories on it. Despite the fast pace that the story is told, it stills exciting and thrilling until the very end. I really recommend this anime for the ones who loves supernatural stories.",

            "content": "Ah, yes. Trinity Blood. I have to say, I loved this anime. I found it after browsing through some cosplay photos and saw HIM. Cain Nightlord. That got me dying to see it. After I did, I can say I was very suprised. \r\n Story 9/10: The story was very engaging, although slightly typical with the whole, 'vampires vs humans' angle, but after that it's all original. And, who would of thought that a story based around a RELIGION would be so addicting?! The big 'twists' in the series are great in the sense of the betrayals by certain characters do leave you thinking,'Huh?! you mean...He's acually...._____?!'   The Biblical referances I enjoy also. It just shows how out-of-the-norm the series is. \\n\\n\\n\r\n Art 8/10: The art's very pleasing to the eye. Lots of seperate colors, most of them either glowey or bright. The faces are for the most part pretty much the same looking. But, you get over it rather quick. Still, not as pretty as the manga or novels...but still very pretty. The blood and guts is also pretty for an anime, I personally am a diehard 'blood n guts' fanatic, and was somewhat satisfied; but I know of a few people who hate blood n guts, and was part-way grossed out but not enough to stop watching the series altogether. ( There is some decapitation, acual GUTS, and vampire-ism. But that's to be expected.)\\n\\n\\n\r\n Sound 10/10: The soundtrck for this anime is WONDERFUL!!! I love the soft piano peices during the soft moments in paticular. The sound does fit most if not all of the scenes they are in. The Requiem Inoli song had me in tears when I first heard it. Mix that with the scene it plays in...and I turn into emotional girl.\\n\\n\r\n  Now for the harder part, the acual voice-acting itself. The english cast does a wonderful job, potraying emotion, Colleen Clinkinbeard stood out the most to me in that department. The Japanese cast if just as wonderful if not more-so. \\n\\n\r\n Character 9/10: Okay, I'll admit, some of the characters are 'typical', but the development and backgrounds sure do make up for it. My personal favorite for his development as a character is Pope Alessandro. Abel's love for sugar is very 'typical' but that is most of the comic relief of the series, and without it the series would be far too serious to be watched by most of the general public. \\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment 10/10: I loved this series. After watching the first episode from the internet, I immediately bought the entire series as soon as I could.  There's action, romance, politics, drama, vampires, and a order that's suspiously Nazi-like. It's a all around good series, that I've watched over and over, and I still enjoy it! \\n\\n\r\n Overall 9/10: A wonderful series with great characters, a great story, great art, and it just sucks you in. The only backfire I could see is the obvious religious-terms. (If you are a Catholic sensitive to women being cardnials, murderers being preists, and a teenage Pope...then this series might not be for you. But otherwise, I recommend  it fully!   It is and remains, one of my all-time favorite animes.",

            "content": "I have called Trinity Blood \"Trigun with Vampires\", and this is, not a bad approximation. Abel, the main character, is the crusnik version of Vash, Cain of Knives. Both series revolve around one brother trying to seek revenge on the other for killing someone precious to them. Trigun just does a better job of explaining the back story. That being said, it's not an overall bad thing. There are enough original elements that make up for it's similarities. The characters are strong, the artwork is gorgeous. \r\nMost of Trinity Blood's issues are in it's story. The series seems rushed, and that's good for the lackof fillers, but bad for understanding what's going on. I have never read the manga, so I was left confused by a lot of the events. Very little of the back story is explained, even in the final episode. It takes away from what could have been an epic battle, because you don't really understand why they're fighting. However, the rest of the storyline is well done. It's another vampire vs human story, somewhat like Hellsing, but much more involved.  \\n\\n\r\nI still really enjoyed the series. The opening theme is great, as is the soundtrack. Overall, if you're into vampire stories, Trinity Blood is not one to miss!",

            "content": "Back before Meyer's Twilight ruin the entire vampire scene and gay'd up the genre. Trinity Blood was the go-to vampire anime series that had it all, at least when it ran on adult swim during unforgettable nights. Nowadays, I avoid ever having anything to do with vampires, period.\r\nBut nonetheless, I found myself going through the series once more and found it to be pretty refreshing.\r\n/* -= Art=- */\r\nIf you're a steam punk fan, you'll definitely love Trinity Blood's Victorian-style art. Much of the enjoyment of the show lies in the background artwork and it sets the theme for the rest of the episode, pretty muchlike the background of a street fighter stage.\\n\\n\r\nThere is, however, one draw back to the style that Trinity Blood uses. For maximum quality or effect of the style to take place, you need to view the show in a dim-lighted room. Watching it in board daylight is like walking through a haunted house fully lit.\\n\\n\r\nThe character's overall look is also design for cosplay. Pretty much anyone who has ever laid there hands on a fantasy MMORPG has played a priest, and anyone with a Priest clothing fetish, well you do the math.\\n\\n\r\n/* -= Character=- */\\n\r\nCharacter development in Trinity Blood is more or less important. There is only one thing you need to know about the characters; either vampire or not a vampire. Once you can make the distinction, nothing matters. The human characters don't usually last long or live long enough to develop, mostly they died fairly quickly. On the other hand, vampires or noble characters generally fights Abel and ends up dying anyways.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, the only characters that matter is the Abel, Cain, and Esther. Esther pretty much keeps the anime from being a sausage-fest, so other than that, she is just the cheerleader in the background or Abel's rebound girl.\\n\\n\r\nAbel and Cain's character developed is slow and gradual, but usually developed the same way like a yin-yang roll. Nothing deep, nothing special, but the point is their fighting each other based on different beliefs.\\n\\n\r\n/* -= Enjoyment=- */\\n\r\nFor maximum enjoyment, don't watch this anime during daytime. Originally, I discover this series on Adult Swim and the overall art style is extremely fitting when viewing at night.\\n\\n\r\nParticularly, I enjoyed the parts where Abel goes Crusniks mode and pretty much owns up the place. Blood pours, splashes, and even defy gravity. The music shoots up %100 in volume (and stays that way on average until the battle ends)  and the choir of singing death angels follow by a overkill of pain and agony background music ensues. \\n\\n\r\nResearch has known that %90 of the Adult Swim viewers' bodies were not ready to watch Trinity Blood.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "Set in the far future, in a universe where Vampires and humans are at constant war with one another, Trinity blood provides an interesting blend of drama, science fiction, and fantasy elements. On the one side, we have a race of superhuman mutants living with a nano-virus that provides them with incredible strength and speed, at the expense of being able to stay in sunlight and not being able to generate their own hemoglobin  (thus they must drink normal human blood). At the other end we have regular humans, governed by the resources and technology of the mighty Roman Catholic Church. \r\nThe series' maincharacter is Abel Nightroad, A priest with a long, bloody past of violence and destruction as a participant in the war with humans. Throughout the series we come to see just exactly how father Nightroad comes to \"bear his sins\" as a devilish looking vampire that drinks the blood of other vampires. \\n\\n\r\nWe find that the other major characters have their own troubled pasts as well. But for the sake of brevity, I will ask the reader to watch the series to find out, as opposed to explaining too much. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to its colorful cast of characters, the series deals with dark and foreboding themes of death, sin, atonement, and moral paradoxes that arise within religion and politics. And while I cannot go into much further detail, I can at least say this: for those of you who like to think about big, grandiose issues, Trinity blood will certainly give you plenty of food ( or should i say...blood ?) for thought. \\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, for those of you looking for more mindless entertainment, Trinity blood is no pushover in terms of fighting and cool superpowers. Also note that this is 1000 years into the future, so the series certainly doesn't lack awesome weapons either. The Catholic church never looked more badass with its shear array of weapons, holograms, and even cyborgs. \\n\\n\r\nTo say the least, Trinity Blood is series with something for everyone, and should almost certainly, be seen more than once, with its powerful themes and undertones, colorful cast, and the awesome powers and technologies introduced. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Abel is still a penny-pinching, secret weapon priest, but his transformation and reasoning for fighting the Vampires are varied compared to the manga. Esther's background and meeting of Abel and the official church is different. Some of the characters in the show didn't exist in the manga. I have no ill will against Anime List but I hope this review helps in some way. The show is very misleading and makes me wonder what the team was thinking when making the show.I might have to watch and re-read the anime before I can continue adding information.",

And I've been going on-and-on against the long-standing idea that shounen leads should either be spineless self-insert nobodies or non-existent.\r\nIt's a good thing that Trinity Blood was created before the Great Recession screwed the whole world up.\r\n3-Blood isn't so much an anime; Gonzo's best in terms of creating something that isn't aimed for the slobbering otaku audience, by the way. But it's more like a 24-episode \"Rest In Peace, Yoshida Sunao.\" The somber cloud hovering over this title had taken all ofthe fun out of it.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, it's R~E~A~L S~L~O~W. The ruder people in the audience would yell \"GET ON WITH IT!!!\" if this was played in some movie theatre.\\n\\n\r\nIf anybody wants to make comparisons with this anime, I'd compare it with Hellsing. Only...:\\n\\n\r\n* 3-Blood has more nuns and more characters overall.\\n\r\n* Abel's \"Crouching Goofball Hidden Badass\" as oppose to Alucard's 100% badassery.\\n\r\n* His holiness is a cute shota.\\n\r\n* Thunderous music over thunderous gunplay (despite Tres' use of gun-fu from the Equilibrium movie).\\n\r\n* That darkening realization that \"people die.\"\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah.

The story revolves around Abel Nightroad, a human vampire hybrid who works for the Vatican. The Vatican and the Empire of vampires are the strongest remaining powers in the world and earth is caught in a war between the humans and vampires. I personally thought that the premise was very promising, but I had a lot of issues with this show.The action is cool yet repetitive, and the music is also cool and gloomy, but loses its luster after the millionth time eachsong is played. I thought it took a long time to pick up, let alone get really good, the characters are made very well and look cool;but lack some personality, but my main beef with the show is that you don't really feel much of anything. There isn't much that compels you to watch the show, no motivation to make you feel bad for the characters, except during the middle of the show, during the events of Ion's story arc. Not to mention all the other shows that the anime borrows from; I felt the entire ending scene was just Trigun with vampires. Even the result was the same. I really enjoyed the middle but the end was the stake in the heart, er, nail in the coffin for me, because there's a big ending fight but nothing gets resolved. Overall Trinity Blood is decent and flashy but flops in the end for me personally.",

            "content": "Trinty Blood is an anime about a continuing war between terrans (humans) and methuselah (vampire like creatures) after the appocalypse. In this there are two main powers, the vatican governed by the terran pope and based around the catholic church and the Empire which is governed by methuselah, who control a mainly terran populace. \r\nThe anime centers around a vatican priest named Abel Nightroad, who is a member of the vatican AX special division and is a cruisnik - a vampire which feeds on vampire blood. The story shows the continuing battles between the terran and mathuselah populace and the political masernations of the vatican,where the young pope is advised by two opposite personalities each who try to impose their will on the pope. \\n\\n\r\nOn the surface and by the first episode I thought this show was destined to be a very high ranked show on my list, the story involving the two empires at war, a dose of political intrigue and a light hearted main character who can be compared closely to Vash the stampede (Trigun) (Also wondering if the vampire knight writer was getting tips on his headmaster whilst watching...) all of which I love. The further into the series that the anime gets however the more the plot seems not to fit, there are episodes which seemingly end showing the appearance of a character who doesn't make an entrance, sub plots which are never resolved, at best the story is a patchwork from the origional novels, which were very good, but completely ruined here.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is done by gonzo and looks like a lot of the gonzo productions (Full metal panic), it sometimes feels almost too cheery. A lot of this plot is dark, and the bright and round characters lighten the mood slightly where it should be darkened and bring the viewer in. The voice actors are top quality however, and make up for most of the cheery artwork to create the proper atmosphere. The characters suffer from the storyline and you never get any in depth explanations of any opf the characters, even with the main character Abel, at the end we are still left guessing on much of his past which is important to the storyline. \\n\\n\r\nStill this is not a bad anime, it just irks me to see an anime which could and should have been better and been a true great. As it stands its a good anime to sit a watch, the politics is not too invlved, the fight scenes are mostly good fun to watch and the characters are watchable. Don't however raise your expectations on the first episode, you'll just have to mark it down again once your done.",

The plethora of biblical references is interesting, and, unlike many of it's genre [the demons-must-be-stopped-by-an-elite-faction-of-the-church sort] it thoroughly involves the church to a much more realistic extent.\r\nI was immediately interested by the dynamic between the Pope and his siblings and their character growth throughout the series.\r\nThat's something that I greatly appreciated about this anime, that you don't always see: character growth, and legitimate, realistic character growth at that.\r\nSomething that's instantaneously striking when you first so muchas see a screencap of the show is the brilliantly gorgeous artstyle and attention to detail. Structures are ornate, shading realistic and dynamic, people of varying face-shapes and body-types. It's not one of those take-away-the-colors-and-you-could-assign-any-hair-to-any-face-to-make-a-different-character animes.\\n\\n\r\nOn a whole, the plot is wonderful, however it just sort of... ends. As far as conclusions go it felt unsatisfying. I completely understand the want to create the idea of &quot;life goes on&quot; and &quot;even if the series is over the characters' lives aren't&quot; I get that, absolutely, but it just fell a little flat. Not awfully flat, but a bit flat all the same.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed Trinity Blood and would recommend it to anyone interested. It's really not your typical vampire anime, and it's worth giving a try.",

            "content": "Story - 7\r\nOk well I love a good vampire anime as much as the next and Trinity Blood, well lets just say that it lives up to MOST expectations. Now I\u2019m not going to reveal any of the plot so fear not, during the rather numerous introduction episodes we are introduce, slowly I might add, to who will be the main cast and all this is fine but in the latter episodes in the series I found the storyline rather confusing and at the end it left a lot to still be explained, like who was that woman? Or why did he become good ifback then he was evil? I personally believe all these questions have arisen from the transition of Manga to Anime and due to the unanswered questions I will have to bring my rating for the story down to a 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nThe quality of the art here is what is to be expected for a recent(ish) anime and the blend of CGI and Animation works well, so much so that I\u2019m sure most people watching would be unable to tell that there even was CGI (unlike Initial D *shudder*) and it is for that reason I give the art a 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nOk now to explain why sound gets the lowest rating from me. Now don't get me wrong I\u2019m not criticising the voices in fact quite the opposite I LOVED most of the cast they used in this such as Monica Rial, Vic Mignogna and Greg Ayres. but it was the sound effects that let it down in my opinion, and no I\u2019m not saying they were bad either but there were parts while watching when you'll have to reach for the remote to hear what some people are saying and then you'll have to grab it again because your head is being blown off by the sudden change from REALLY quiet talking to eardrum poppingly loud explosions. So my only real comment is that the sound effects were too loud when compared to the actual voices of the characters, hence why I only gave the sound a 6.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\\n\r\nAbel Nightroad: Now this guy is THE main character and also a bit of a klutz...or so he seems but be careful when you annoy him because this dog has a bite that\u2019s worse than his bite.\\n\\n\r\nSister Esther Blanchette: Well there\u2019s not really much to say about this person except that she tends to let her emotions get the best of her in more than one occasion and also tends to get in the way of the others also on more than one occasion\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah all the characters have quite unique personalities some of which are very unusual to say the least but the combined chemistry of all the characters gives the overall rating of an 8.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nNow this was really good to watch in the early episodes but as the main storyline develops the amount of unanswered questions and the importance of them greatly increases which is why it only receives a 7. The reason it is no lower is because this really is a good show despite all its drawbacks.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nOverall I give Trinity Blood an 8 it has good art and interesting characters but the storyline is really the only major drawback. However having said that I still rate this an 8 and a MUST-SEE anime.\\n",

The more I watched it the more it took on its own personality with only a small amount of similarities between the two anime. I started reading the manga a few years back but didn't get very far into it. But that being said, I can assume that this is one of those anime that is better left read rather than watched. I could tell there were gaps in the story that just left me wondering what had happened next. I recognized some ofthe music from final fantasy which was pretty cool. I found the ending to be very anti-climatic. I wish I could say more about what I thought about the final episode but I'd be going into details and probably spoil it for some of you. Let me just reiterate how much I thought the final episode was VERY anti-climatic. If the producers are planning to make a second season, I can understand why they took the direction they did. If not, it's just disappointing.",

Unfortunately, that meant I had no idea what it was about. I\u2019m an avid lover of vampire themed Anime, so I decided to at least give it a try. \r\nThe story in Trinity Blood is very good compared to some of the Anime I\u2019ve seen. From the very first episode, I was excited to continue the series. It seemed to have a unique twist, with a being who fed not on humans but vampires. The series after the first episode however,does get a little slow. It takes time to build up the necessary information for viewers to understand. The plot though does pick up again, and it\u2019s worth the slow bits. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound are absolutely amazing in Trinity Blood. Not only does the art contrast characters, places, and events, but it combines with sound to pull the viewer in. Combining art and sound, Trinity Blood creates a whole a different universe for the series. Also, I personally enjoyed both the dubbed and subbed episodes. \\n\\n\r\nTrinity Blood does create some of the greatest characters. At first, viewers may tend to write off the significance of characters. The characters do change along with the story though, creating a different perspective for audiences. These changes for the characters often reveal human struggles, which we can all learn from. \\n\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed watching this Anime, and I\u2019m sure others will too. The story, combined with art, sound, and complex characters, allows viewers to enjoy at least something within the series. I\u2019m personally found of character, and sound. If others enjoy the same more so, then they\u2019ll probably enjoy watching Trinity Blood.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Trinity Blood is an Anime worth watching. Its story may not be the most unique, but it does have unique twists and turns. For having no clue about the Anime, I truly did enjoy the experience of all the episodes. It\u2019s a great Anime to watch, especially if viewers are looking for something with a little different spin on things. \\n",

All I have say about this series...is that it was beautifully done, storyline and Artistically wise. It pulled a lot of heartstrings in me at the end of the Series, especially when all no doubt thought Abel Nightroad died thanks to Cain. \r\nAll in all this Anime gets 10s in every category rank you can do on here. I recommend this Anime and the Manga even to anyone who is interested in a Political yet Beautiful Vampire Storyline as well as if your intothe whole Heart string pulling sort of Animes that are out there.",

            "content": "I can summarize this entire series into one sentence.  Abel told himself not to kill, therefore, sacrificed thousands of innocent lives to spare two or more evil men. So many characters died because he refused to kill like he had \"allegedly\" what seems like thousands of times before.\r\nThis was a cliched series, and was let down by it's stagnant character portrayal. I'm not very harsh with most animes, but this one is GROSSLY overrated. Luckily I watched this at work while occupying myself with other things, and I'm glad I did not focus my sole attention on this underwhelming story.  Full of weakcharacters with little logic and terrible voice acting (the dub at least).",

            "content": "After several vampire anime, I get very tired of the idea of vampires fighting humans and one believing that they are the true race and what not, but the idea of a higher species, a vampire that feeds on vampires, really got me interested. I thought that it had very good animation and a pretty good story. The only real problem that I had is the lack of backround information and character development for Able, the main character. They show very small flashbacks of his previous life and why he fights, but they never really explain what happened to him and why he does whathe does. You can kind of peice it together but there are still alot of spaces. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this, overall, I really enjoyed this anime and I would definitely recomend it. There is alot of good action and fights.",
