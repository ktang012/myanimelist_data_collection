            "content": "In the seasonal anime approach, on every single one, we will receive once in a while an ecchi and harem with the battle tournament trope light novel adaptation, most likely from one, two or four of them, depending how many they announced in each said season. \r\nThe thing is, for most of the cases, people will go and judge based upon the cover and its setting, the synopsis, etc, even the source being based out of (which I personally find the generalization of the Light Novel Medium being judged upon the genre and setting quite annoying, ridiculous and quite stupid, assuming for a lot ofreasons in the whole generalization would be based upon its adaptation, not its sources materials, but still, they are still doing this and based upon 1 or a few as a whole, and it\u2019s ridiculous). \\n\\n\r\nWhile it looks like a copy and paste of the same old as per usual, the thing that matters is the execution to it, not the things that were made before stated above, since technically a lot of people does this to make the battle tournament, ecchi and harem trope look like some sort of bad thing, when it\u2019s not in the perspective. \\n\\n\r\nThis is something to come across the spectrum of these settings in both the Light Novel and Anime Medium to compare which are better based upon the content being delivered and its direction rather than being judged based upon the statements above this paragraph, since it also gives an idea of a decent qualified series towards a good one worth a watch for the viewer being presented in order to get into these. \\n\\n\r\nIn this season of fall anime 2015, we got two battle tournament, ecchi and harem series which are the names of Gakusen Toshi Asterisk and Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry or by the English names:  A Chivalry of the Failed Knight or A Tale of Worst One. This review will be mainly focusing upon this anime series and my personal thoughts upon it. \\n\\n\r\nDoes it live upon the expectations that I was looking for and could become a treat for people? Or did it failed to deliver what I wanted in the show and becomes as another shallow anime to be forgotten in the pits of hell? Let\u2019s go and find out if it\u2019s actual an actual treat to watch, or it just becomes an unbearable experience to watch during the time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd before I start with my review, I will give a fair warning of two things.\\n\\n\r\nFor one thing, I will just go and give my personal thoughts and perspective without comparing with other shows unless its needed, so if you will have a problem with my personal opinion on the show, feel free to talk about it. \\n\\n\r\nThe second thing being, I will of course kind of spoil some stuff about the anime, just some aspects that I like about this series to defend my statement upon my review and if I do not do it then I might get some sort of problem due to my review. \\n\\n\r\nSo keep that warning upon the words, if you want to stick around with the review then sure let\u2019s go on the road, if not, I would suggest just watch a few episodes and maybe come back to read the review back to know my full perspective of this anime series. It\u2019s a suggestion.\\n\\n\r\nWithout anything behind, let's go to my anime review of Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in a school, where pretty much revolves around magic knights, also modern magic users who fight against each other with weapons converted from their own souls. Our Main Protagonist, Ikki Kurogane arrives to this particular school to actually train these Mage Knights, however he\u2019s more of a failure due to his lack of talent of using magic, labeling him as \u201cA Failure Knight\u201d or also known as \u201cThe Worst One\u201d.  \\n\\n\r\nGetting way less than average marks in the scores, he was forced to repeat another year. However, one day he meets a girl named Stella Vermillion, as she challenged him to a duel due to some \u201cissues\u201d coming around. From that, the duel had some sort of payment, the loser must obey the other for the rest of their lives.\\n\\n\r\nBased upon the synopsis, many would judge upon it to clarify the story is generic. In a way, yes the story is generic to a degree, there are a few reasons why the story itself is quite different than the others, and it doesn\u2019t make it completely special, however it does make the show quite worth a while on its way that could become a treat for a few people.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly one of the few aspects I like about the show would be its romance. To not give much of details of that aspect of the show, the series does establish a well-developed relationship between the two main characters and also establishes a realistic slow pace in order to flesh it out and to make them confront their issues of confessing to one another their feelings, their desires, etc. It gives some sort of realistic approach and direction towards their relationship which seems rather more natural with it's own pacing, which fleshes out their bonds as the episodes passes by. I find it very appealing for the show and it gives some sort of different spark with the plot progression as well. I'll say one thing, this romance is not like one of the best out there though, however it does a very good job executing it and as well giving it a more natural look into it. So in other words, the chemistry on this genre is very suitable and well done in terms of the story department, which is points going forward for the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe Second strong point of the series, would be its battle tournament and their way of doing it. If you take between Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, there is quite a difference between the two. Rakudai\u2019s way of the battle tournament is more of the character\u2019s strength more than the character\u2019s strategy, which with one of the quotes of the show stated in some episodes, each character shows their strength with all the given power they got and that makes it personally, a lot entertaining. It also gives some sort of \"show, don't tell\" around type of approach, in which each battle they technically demonstrate the powers these people have in their hands, while it's not really something new, the way they execute it, most cases of the show its really does a nice job to it. Of course, the series does a nice job into its execution on the fight scenes, and I will appreciate that.\\n\\n\r\nThird thing coming from Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, in each said or so episodes, it breaks some of the clich\u00e9s that usually most ecchi harems have, usually the clich\u00e9s aren\u2019t a bad thing however it does get tiring for a bit after some time. Let\u2019s give one simple example of a clich\u00e9 breaking which is not a big spoiler. In the first episode when usually the main protagonist that enters in the room or let\u2019s say the main female protagonist\u2019s room and the female is actually semi-naked, it ends up as a misunderstanding and the main character becomes really dense as fuck due to it (honestly I love that type of part, for some apparent reason really) and then a lot of mixed up stuff happens. For Rakudai\u2019s case however, that really doesn\u2019t happen when the in before the female lead hits the guy or goes around and say some misunderstanding. After that entrance and almost some misunderstanding shit happening, the main protagonist actually took off his own shirt so they can be equally fine and dandy. Like literally, that was one of the few clich\u00e9 breakers the series has and I was actually shocked by that, not really like oh my god, but I was actually surprised with that, and there\u2019s actually more from that point onward, as the show slowly breaks its cliches and it's really something nice looking, unlike some shows that really do not break these cliches, instead they accumulated more.\\n\\n\r\nFor the fan service department so from what I can tell, it\u2019s really not that much to drag the show into a hell hole. In fact, a few little of the fan service moments of the series between the two main characters works well for the case. For example in one of the few first episodes we get this washing scene which technically the female protagonist washes the MC, however it works because right afterwards she changes later on and can be noticed throughout the show after that. It sounds ridiculous but for me, my personal opinion it actually worked, and for the rest I will say the fan service for others isn\u2019t really heavily focused on that, as I would the show focuses on the battle tourneys and the romance than that, so if you are not a fan of heavy dose of fanservice, then don't worry, this doesn't have THAT much.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally to describe the dialogue for this series in a short sentence, I would say it\u2019s not one of the best dialogues, but it\u2019s not one of the worst dialogues I can say. I had no issues with it considering it\u2019s not supposed to be a complexity series, it\u2019s quite simple and not that much to go and make it ground breaking. That\u2019s a weak point for the story department in a way and to an extension around.\\n\\n\r\nI would say out of these positive aspects of the show, I would say I only had one personal complaint in the anime which still bugged me even today. Which even though it\u2019s not something ground breaking in the series considering it\u2019s quite small and quite nitpicky, this wouldn\u2019t affect the score of the anime overall a lot. \\n\\n\r\nThere was one of the episodes in the battle fight, where basically there was this one little clich\u00e9 moment, which felt out of place and kind of weird in a way to defeat the guy like that. It just felt really out of place for my concern, but it\u2019s not a big issue to say the least, it\u2019s just pointing something out here.\\n\\n\r\nIn the overall story department, I would say Rakudai even though with its generic setting and plot, it still delivers things quite nicely and does a very good job with its execution execution despite these statements above about the judgmental idea other people would have about the show at first sight when it was announced. It\u2019s sort of a treat for anyone that wants something new in a degree (from what I have just mentioned a bit regarding on the romance and would include on the characters). However from coming with this statement saying it would be a treat for anyone that wants something new, this would depend on the viewer at hand. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, this series isn't really for everyone in terms of the story (in terms of the plot) so I will keep a warning towards people. If anything, if you want something rather originally executed and having its own spark, I would suggest this, however this all depends on your own hands and your taste on anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  \\n\\n\r\nThis is another department which is another strong point of the show. While the cast of characters are not really original, since they are all basically your archetype characters, the way they were established and portrayed in personalities wise is done well in this case. They all act in a mature way and at least most of these were developed nicely without any issues having with them. Most of the cast of characters have a motivation to fight and also their strengths can be shown throughout the episodes, which in my eyes the way they show it is very well. \\n\\n\r\nIkki, the main protagonist of the show is considered as the most mature character of the series, technically because in a few situations throughout the series, he\u2019s more of a tolerable, patient and very knowledgeable character in a way. He shows also some determination in one of the episodes to help out when it was needed, and technically also he\u2019s not a dense character either. To say the least this is one of the nicest characters I personally like, and Ikki is a prime example of it. \\n\\n\r\nStella is known as your tsundere, red hair with twin tails, with fire magic and princess archetype. However for her case she does care about Ikki after a few said episodes, and from that her change comes bit by bit throughout the series. Although my only complaint about her is nothing too personal, but I personally would want to see more of her fights with others in a full fight in a way. The last time we actually had that was by the first episode. But she\u2019s overall a nice and loveable girl. Also this is coming as a personal view but \\n\r\nMainly together with the two Ikki and Stella, as I stated before in this review, their relationship with each other feels very dynamic and nicely done, which makes them even more loveable in my personal opinion as a whole between the two.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting cast of character, I will say the one that got most development outside of the established relationship between the two characters, Ikki and Stella, would be Ayase, technically she was one of the most developed characters alone in a way in her arc. She was nicely done in her little arc which I was actually impressed with it. \\n\\n\r\nFor the second it may be Shizuku, while many people would say she\u2019s either fodder or annoying, I personally can see why people could get annoyed by her and hate her, but I personally don\u2019t think she\u2019s all that bad either. She shows some support towards her brother in a way (not in the incest way, not that) and throughout the episodes she does develop as well and does have determination to fight and become stronger. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Shizuku, there\u2019s also her partner which is Alice. Alice is more considered as a supporter for both Ikki and Shizuku in the series, although he doesn\u2019t get any specific spotlight in the battle tournament aspect, he really shows as a supportive character who wants to help Ikki and the others in a way. Also as a personal income, I personally love his character design and voice acting. I will say that as a bonus.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Todo Toka, I will say she doesn\u2019t get as much screen time as the others since she\u2019s introduced at the near specifically almost near the end of the show by being introduced in episode 9 of the show, which is actually saddening considering she shows a lot of strength and proving herself as the strongest female character in here at the moment. However that doesn\u2019t really mean she\u2019s bad in here to say the least I will say that as a bonus. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other cast of members in this series, there are a few of them that don\u2019t get as much screen time as the others, making it look kind of underwhelming in a degree. \\n\\n\r\nA few others gets a few more than the other characters and become more relevant, but in that I will say it\u2019s quite sour mouthing and it really feels like they should have some sort of actual role later on (for those that only get a few appearances) and it\u2019s kind of the disappointment here.\\n\\n\r\nIn the overall characters aspect, this is the other strong point of the anime series based upon the overall curriculum, being the story having a lot more going forward than this, thanks to the other cast of characters excluding the supportive cast feeling a bit underwhelming and could have been done better giving them a sort of relevance later on in the series. The overall cast I would describe the main and support cast as the good part, the other characters being more of the below average part of it.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: \\n\\n\r\nTo describe the art and the animation in a simple sentence, I would say it\u2019s not in all honesty in the masterpiece level, but it\u2019s very eye catching and nicely done in terms of both aspects of the series in this paragraph, along with a lot of things to explain from this. To explain the art firstly, its quality isn\u2019t really one of the best out there, but the studio does a nice job at making the art style eye catching and colorful and at the same time, in its own way. \\n\\n\r\nThe color palette has some sort of pop into the anime that it looks actually very good and it\u2019s nicely catching the eye and clean, also the use a variety of color palettes in different sceneries of the anime that makes it look very appealing for the show. The character designs also look very appealing with the backgrounds of the art of the anime, which I have no issue with it at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe pallets used for the show also were used in the fitting mood of the atmosphere of the series, from the very heart warming rainbow colors and the cherry blossoms flying around in symbol of the love relationship towards the dark shading black and red in one of the episodes, when the use of the colors were the symbol of depression and it\u2019s ominous as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation can be describe in many ways, sure it\u2019s not one of the best animation departments out there of all time, and I am not going to put the show on the masterpiece level of animation department, however it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t say it\u2019s good either. In fact, if I go through this, the animation does take an approach of fluid motion and it doesn\u2019t look even inconsistent, the angles they take for the anime does looks very nice overall, it\u2019s actually very appealing and clean, without any type of ground breaking motion or anything like that. \\n\\n\r\nThey take different directions and angles in order to make the fight scenes look very organized and also another entertaining treat to watch. They sometimes take a slow motion in the anime which looks nice for the anime to do that type of approach to it. \\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes does look very fresh and it doesn\u2019t keep me as the viewer with burning eyes out considering I hate when I see something as bad as Lance N Masques or Mars of Destruction level. In all honesty overall both got a lot of points for giving a treat towards me and it\u2019s nicely, clean and freshly made, with a lot of sparkles in the show and a lot of directions they took into it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character designs I would say they\u2019re not really original, however their designs looks good and without feeling very eye soaring or anything ground breaking towards me. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the art not living to its Light Novel Illustrations as a whole (I have not read the Light Novels yet, but I checked their illustrations and I like it a lot) the anime does a nice job to at least keep its anime designs at most. That will be a bonus from them to that point.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the Art/Animation department is one of the other essential parts of the anime, keeping the show strong and consistent without feeling like its inconsistent, choppy or anything like that along the lines.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound:\\n\\n\r\nNow for the final point of the anime series of Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, the last thing would be the sound department, the music and the voice acting tones. This is probably the component that makes the art and animation very enjoyable with its soundtrack and its sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nTo start off with the music department, the music composer is known as Kotaro Nakagawa, the same person who composed soundtracks such as Code Geass (seasons 1 and 2) which I personally find it very pleasing for Rakudai's soundtrack. The music soundtrack as a whole for Rakudai is considered as pleasing and ear catching, it just makes the fights engaging and also the moments dynamic, entertaining, and enjoyable. To give an idea, I will give you some examples.\\n\\n\r\nOne example being \"Nimrod\" (soundtrack #20) which gives a mixture of a fast paced along with a more jazzy tone by combining upbeat, the piano and along with the trumpets which gives a more dynamic and fitting feel for the fight.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example would be \"tension feeling\" (soundtrack #17) which gives the same tone upbeat but a bit more intense for the moments that are important for the cast of characters, its just soothing at the end which gives a uniqueness of its own (seasonal wise).\\n\\n\r\nMy final example would be \"worst one\" (soundtrack #1) give more of an instrumental composition approach and the tone of the music is just very enjoyable, probably one of my most enjoyable soundtracks of the OST pack Rakudai has released, since it goes to my personal taste actually.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack just goes and give a more enjoyable feel to the series and that\u2019s what makes the show a bonus for me. However, the soundtracks could be considered a little bit overused, but that doesn't mean the soundtrack overall is bad with that standard. It could have been done a bit more to compose more soundtracks in the end except there were a few that were used not so often which is nice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I will say the soundtrack as a standalone is enjoyable and iconic to listen to, along with the anime battle scenes. The soundtracks can be found since it got released around the moment so its easy to be found.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound department, I can\u2019t say the soundtrack is quite the best one I have ever heard, however it does a nice job with its effects in the right time and place, it just makes the show more gripping with the swords clashing and many things to describe.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBy the voice acting approach, considering I am watching the series weekly and in the seasonal, I would say this at least. The voice acting tone fits to their respective characters, I had no issues with that actually.\\n\\n\r\nEach one of the voice actors did a nice job with their performances and making the characters sound a bit more mature at least, and the emotion, etc, does fit nicely in the perspective. Rakudai of course has some few little mediocre voice acting, considering I could say the voices from the other casts (outside of supportive and main cast) do not actually have enough time to get me impressed at least, that\u2019s another point to go for the little while.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Opening and the Ending songs I will say the Opening is quite unique out of the others from the fall season, but not unique overall in the spectrum of the media. It gives a more jazz and upbeat component and it does fit with its visuals, which gives the black and white color palette with the red, symbolizing the blood in some areas. I would personally say, I like the Opening, TV version.\\n\\n\r\nI would say this, for me personally the full version kills in a way the experience I had with the Rakudai Opening. Not that the whole Opening is bad, because music is kind of subjective/personal, but I felt like not hearing the song again.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Ending song of Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, themed performance by ALI PROJECT (the same person that did the performances of Another OP, Code Geass R1 ED1 and R2 ED2, Katanagatari OP2 and ED6 and .hack//Roots ED), The ending for this is composed with a mixture of bits of techno in some parts and the most of it is instrumental, which I personally like the tone of the song, however with its visuals I will say it\u2019s not as creative as the Opening song with the visual standpoint, but it looks nice. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of fan service, since the ED has some shots of the girls naked in still frame and the motion goes from upscale and down. Not a big issue there, but to say the least the song is beautiful in a way. Good Job ALI PROJECT.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nRakudai is one of those shows that may be considered as an overlooked show based upon the synopsis (not that it\u2019s actually underrated, it\u2019s just people skipping this show because of the setting is what I consider overlooked). Yes, it can be generic but towards a degree where its romance and the mixture of the battle tournament trope handled nicely and not ground breaking and nice characters, despite them being generic, shine the show along the way as the episodes passes by.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art would not be one of the best out there of all time, but thanks to it palette and backgrounds, the angles and the colors they use towards the sceneries and the mood displayed also was a nice direction towards the anime series, and also with a nice and eye catching soundtrack that gives a well-deserved complement. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end in my humble opinion, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry had exceeded the expectations I never thought I could find in this type of trope of anime (for my experience), and in my personal opinion, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry got towards the absolute potential and became one with it's actual \"identity\" of it's own. It became something I would actually recommend, if anyone likes the battle tourney trope with something a little sugar on top, which turns into a nice thing to love an enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nIf a second season also comes around, I would be glad to watch the continuation of the show, just because of my statements above and how much I love the show (this is rather personal).\\n\\n\r\nWho should I recommend and who should I not recommend? The answer I will state this simple down below.\\n\\n\r\nI would only recommend this show if you into:\\n\\n\r\n- Generic synopsis but nicely executed\\n\r\n- Straightforward Romance \\n\r\n- Battle Tournaments \\n\r\n- Entertainment \\n\r\n- Simple Story wise \\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend this to people if you are into:\\n\\n\r\n- Something ORIGINAL (in terms of the plot, if you dont like the synopsis/plot)\\n\r\n- Developed Romance (as in the show develops the relationship bit by bit until their confessions rather than going straight forward to it)\\n\r\n- Complex Storytelling",

            "content": "Rakudai Kisihi no Calvary is a show that does a hell of a lot more wrong than it does right, manages to fall into all the typical LN tropes, and still manages to have an incredibly fervent fanbase which thinks that somehow it is an original show which averts many tropes used in LN-adaptations. While I admit that the show manages more right than wrong in one or two aspects, it still manages to be an incredibly bland and generic LN adaptation in the eyes of almost anyone who is experienced enough anime. This review involves spoilers, but honestly no one should care about spoilersin a show this bad. Still, you have been warned. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is basically that Japan won WWII, a hierarchical society of magic users (where magical aptitude is superior to all) exists, and the main character is someone who apparently sucks at magic and yet somehow can conveniently fight on an equal level to some of the best students in an academy that apparently is renown for training magicians. \\n\\n\r\nNo, I did not describe Mahouka to you just now. That is Rakudai. \\n\\n\r\nLet me continue, our female main character is a girl with reddish pinkish hair, who conveniently forgets to lock her door while dressing up (in the very first episode) while the main character walks in. Our main character responds by stripping in exchange to her baring her unmentionables accidentally (something no human being does and is done only for the sake of comedy) and then establishes himself as a fairly reasonable person, complaining because the girl didn't lock the door and that it was an accident.  \\n\\n\r\nSo basically, it's attempting to be witty and breaks any chance of me taking this guy seriously. \\n\\n\r\nThat's without mentioning a character's ability at copying movements (Kakashi from Naruto says hi), the girl using a fire sword (because Shana), our main character having the same conflict as Tatsuya from Mahouka (though he's a lot better than that abomination of a \"character\") and even an Accelerator like character who is randomly and maniacally doing crazy things. That's without mentioning just how absurd some of the powers are (your pupil losing color gives you a power up, really). Like seriously, that's just plain stupid. \\n\\n\r\nThis show may legit be the most uninspired thing I've ever seen in terms of story. \\n\\n\r\nIf only it was just that, but the characters aren't better either. Stella is a generic tsundere, Kurogane is the blank MC with the occasional moment, he has a sister that is in love with him, some side kick that's kinda cool and...do you see where I'm getting at here? \\n\\n\r\nSo. Finally we come here. What is the show's selling point, that drove its fans insane and say that it's so original and distinct from all those other LN adaptations? \\n\\n\r\nThe main duo get into a relationship. \\n\\n\r\nNah, I'm not pulling your leg here. They legitimately get into a relationship, and it's actually handled alright. By alright, I mean that I'm not cringing every time they interact, and it's actually kinda cute on a superficial level...until you realize it's just that, superficial. \\n\\n\r\nEvery single time they interact, the show feels like it's trying to force you to recognize that it's in a relationship like \"OH GOD THEY KISSED\" or \"OH GOD GIRL IS ASKING GUY TO HAVE SEX\" and so on, and it just doesn't feel natural. No one is legitimately this pushy when in a relationship, and people don't endlessly shove their love lives down people's throats. I will admit that there are a few scenes that are legitimately alright (the cabin scene was nice...then the ending blew it) and that it honestly is nowhere near the worst relationship I've seen in anime, but I'm genuinely surprised that this is considered by its fanbase to be the best relationship between two characters in an LN. Toradora? Hyouka? Oregairu? Spice and Wolf? Seriously, this is the best relationship in an LN-adaptation you guys have seen? The characters aren't even that interesting, you honestly can't describe or think of these guys as people (and let's face it, getting them into a relationship quickly may be a nice idea on a basic level, but makes no sense chemistry-wise, we hardly see them get along as friends and boom they're in a relationship). \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is drop dead gorgeous, especially during the fight scenes. The backgrounds look pretty nice, and there are actually some pretty nice scenery shots throughout the show. I just with they were better spent on some other show, because I honestly don't think this show deserves it. \\n\r\nI can't remember any particular track from the OST, though I guess the opening was alright. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I honestly can't say I enjoyed the show all too much, honestly. It's too cliche for its own good, has only one aspect to remember done in an extremely superficial manner, and is just too much of the same as a whole to enjoy. Like sure, I may be repeating myself here, but it's hard not to feel that when you watch this show. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like this show, fine. I hold no grudge against you (unless it turns into another Mahouka) and can totally understand why you'd like it. Hell, I may have liked it if I watched it when I was 14. But honestly, if you're sick of more of the same and just heard that it's unique or original or any other absurd claim, please avoid it. It's not worth your time.",

            "content": "I'll admit at first glance I also noticed it to be both visually and story related to Asterisk wars however as we all may know by now that Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry has more of a erotic, romance, ecchi genre's in it. While watching I found myself to be highly engaged into the action and battles scenes more than the story. I felt bad though because I personally felt that the story was weak. What I mean by that is I felt like there wasn't much of a \"wow\" or \"oh my god how intense\" moment in the story for me. I did however likethe romance between our main characters. Personally depending on what genre a show is, especially in the genre's of action/adventure/fantasy I feel like every guy needs a woman who is either equally or soon to be be equal in strength. A good example of what I mean would be Kirito and Asuna from Sword Art Online. The character relationship no, let me start with this, the archetypes in the story were pretty generic, nothing too unique or special. I feel like we have all at some point watched a show like Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry with the same characters and personalities.  I was not too surprised to Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry turn into a bit of a harem-ish type show based on the elements in the story along with characters. Especially since in most anime's the weakest characters are usually the ones who will become the strongest both psychically and mentally. They are also the ones  most girls in anime usually fall for.  The BGM and soundtrack didn't really stand out too me as much. I didn't really notice the music playing unless it was one the intro and outro songs or if a battle is going on (I would highly recommend you watch and see for yourself.) To contradict myself for a minute, the fights are indeed intense, so just ignore what I said earlier. The art style was your generic mid 2010+ style so lightly drawn face, simple shadows and  different highlights in hair, that sort of thing. Overall I give this show an 8/10 because to me it really did a good job of breaking the barrier of similarities it shares with other shows just like it!",

            "content": "Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry feels to me like an almost desperate attempt to be different. It intentionally utilizes perhaps the most overused setting and premise in the anime industry as of late, and then tries to put its own spin on it in order to make it stand out from the crowd. I say \"attempt\" however, because unfortunately it never quite lives up to its own potential due to having a tendency of not focusing on its own strengths properly, and thus indirectly making it somewhat generic in the end, even though that's exactly what it's supposed to try its hardest to avoid.\r\nThe story takesplace in a magic academy, and it only takes about 2 minutes and 30 seconds into the first episode before the MC, Kurogane Ikki, walks in on a girl, Stella Vermillion, in her underwear. Yeah I've never seen that development before. One thing leads to another, and the two of them eventually end up in an official duel where the loser has to become the winner's \"slave\". Ikki promptly defeats her in style, and thus immediately scores himself a sexy girl as his personal servant before the end of the first episode. Or at least that's the official verdict, but in reality the two of them are quite friendly with each other, and it doesn't take long before a full-blown romance begins to blossom in-between them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is how Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry aims to be special. By this point we should all know what a typical action/fantasy/ecchi/harem magic academy light novel anime adaptation looks like, not to mention how absurdly many there are of them. This series however tries to kick out the harem aspect, and replace it with romance. Like an actual established romance from very early on in the story. That's an incredibly rare thing to find in any anime, let alone an action-oriented one, and it's a quite refreshing thing to see.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters themselves go, Ikki is supposedly the weakest student in the entire school, nicknamed the \"Worst One\" by the pupils. However, this is strictly because he lacks magical skills, but on the other hand his prowess with the sword is second to none. And sadly that ends up being a mostly negative trait as Ikki thus ends up being an incredibly overpowered protagonist anyway, and there is so much plot armor throughout the fights in this anime that it really doesn't have a whole lot of tension in them. That aside he's an all-round good guy who has a lot of fans and supporters. In that sense he reminds me a lot of Shiba Tatsuya from Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, and I can't really consider that a good thing. However, the way he normally acts towards Stella is very respectable I think, and that probably has to be considered the most important thing in the end. Stella herself on the other hand is not only one of the top students in the academy, but also a fiery redhead who is light on the tsun, heavy on the dere. She's a bit too submissive to be my type personally, but I know many people who like her a lot, and she's also got a pretty stunning body. My one problem with her as a character is that she seemingly falls head over heels in love with Ikki in a split second somewhere in-between episodes 1 and 2, but for no apparent reason. As cute as their romance is, I can't help but feel that it started off awfully unnaturally. It almost feels like the author was impatient at getting his dream pairing up and running, and thus he kind of just forced the two of them together in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nOf course those two aren't literally the only characters in this anime, and this is where we find the first of two problems I have with this anime. Namely, why are there so many other girls in here that are not only prevalent, but also in love with Ikki? Like really? First you make such a big deal about how this is a pure romance anime and not a harem, and then you *still* insist on having a bunch of other girls ogling the MC with lustful eyes? What's the point? We already know with absolute certainty that Ikki x Stella is the established main coupling in the story, so why do you have all these other girls as well? Are they there just in order to cater to certain target audiences, despite the fact that those people would know that their favorite girl has already lost the love game before it's even began? Make up your damn mind already; is this supposed to be a harem or not? It's like it's pretending not to be a harem but it actually is one. You can't just both have the cake and eat it, seriously. I mean if they were just there as friends, classmates or whatnot it'd be one thing, or if their feelings towards Ikki are just there in order to create some light love drama and make Stella jealous or something then I could understand it, but that's not the case here. Instead it's literally just for harem romcom shenanigans, which ought to be the last thing Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry should have in it given its premise.\\n\\n\r\nMy second issue with this anime lies with the action elements. Taking place in a magic academy, naturally there is a lot of dueling going on in-between the students. In fact... there's too much of it. Let's be real here, the one thing which Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry has going for it in comparison to other anime with the same setting is the romance. And yet despite that I swear it's spending more time on magic duels than romantic progression. Furthermore, there's still the simple fact that we got a pretty seriously overpowered protagonist in Ikki, so there's very little excitement in the duels themselves since you always know how they're going to end before they've even began. His abilities oftentimes feel like asspulls too as there are numerous special moves of his which are brought out seemingly out of nowhere in order to turn the fight around. There's also this one scene where at one point he's lying nigh-unconscious in a huge pool of his own blood, only to be in top tier fighting condition and kicking ass a minute later. Like really, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that that's simply impossible. The few times where we get to see fight scenes where Ikki is not involved however, then it's actually a lot better. Especially the magic duel in episode 10 was a treat to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the point is that the entire action/fantasy part of the anime feels almost meaningless a lot of the time. It's predictable and most importantly it doesn't really add anything noteworthy to the romantic part of the story at all. It just drags the romance down rather than complement it. Similarly, like mentioned earlier, the pseudo-harem elements are equally pointless, and does nothing but distract from the one thing which you're probably watching this anime for to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you put all that together, what can you conclude? Well, like I said initially, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is an attempt at taking the most overused premise in modern anime and adding a real romance plotline to it. And that's pretty much what it is. But there is no real sense of compatibility in it. The one thing which makes it worth watching is the romance. Almost everything else in it is average at best. So then I can't help but ask, was there really any point in using this setting to begin with? Why do the action, fantasy and harem elements even exist? Why is it taking place at a magic academy in the first place? Because seriously, this story could just have been an ordinary school-life romance anime taking place at an ordinary high-school with no dueling, no magic, no villains, nothing like that. It could just have been a realistic romance story between Ikki and Stella. That's all it's worth watching for as it is, and there'd be so much more focus on that in an everyday setting compared to what we got. It's like the anime is focusing on its own weaknesses more than its strength in its current state.\\n\\n\r\nOriginality is an admirable thing, and I highly respect Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry for trying to be different. But being unique doesn't always mean being better, and in this case I really feel like it wasn't entirely successful. Sure, it's still definitely better than your typical magic academy anime, no doubt about that, but it's definitely worse than what it could have been if it was rewritten into a dedicated romance story in a normal setting. Or if you want a graphical representation of it, then:\\n\\n\r\nPure romance > Romance + battle harem > Pure battle harem\\n\\n\r\nI.E: mixing good with bad certainly makes it better than just bad, but still not as much as just good. So to speak.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, you can say what you want but the ending is pretty satisfying.",

            "content": "To my loving father and family,\r\nI\u2019m sure you're well aware of what transpired yesterday, and I am deeply aware you're eager to know what up to that moment. I understand you, all miss me, and want to know what my life at school was like so far. \r\nDespite what a lovely time I am having, it did not begin this way. When Ikki and I first met, it was embarrassingly rocky for the two of us, even upon getting to know what we each strive for. Some embarrassing incidents occurred that did not help our situations, especially when I met his sister for the firsttime. She\u2019s an adamant one, I'll tell you. Not everyone has the gall to openly insult royalty so consistently, and entirely out of jealousy and overprotectiveness. I understand her situation, however, as learning what she and especially Ikki went through during childhood, even to the small extent I did, disgusted me. Even with how much she irritates me, I\u2019m almost embarrassed about a majority of my early interactions, as I was never as ladylike as my upbringing. I'm still trying to fully get over that aspect of myself.\\n\\n\r\nShe wasn't the only one I met thanks to Ikki. For one, there's Alice, who not only has fantastic fashion sense, but is by far the most mature out of all of us. She even got me hooked on a video game once. There was this really energetic newspaper club member named Kagami who even helped me overcome a major anxiety of mine. A shy but talented girl named Ayase, daughter of the now obscured icon \u201cThe Last Samurai\u201d even hung out with us for a while. Even other people I didn't get to know for too long as in writing this, were fun to hang out with, such as the student council. I did have run-ins with a few despicable ruffians, but not only did we take them down, but one of them turned out to be somewhat interesting with a crazy weapon and mindset. Of course, I handled myself pretty well against these clowns whenever I had the chance, and so did everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nThe fashion is wonderful here, about as much as back home. Alice knows how to get herself and Shizuku into some trendy social clothes and even Ikki has some great fashion sense. The school uniforms are nice as well. The cars look horrible though, but I don't drive yet so that is of little concern to me now. The music these people listen to, while a tad bombastic in places, is fantastic. I love hearing it whenever Ikki and I go on a morning jog. The culture here is rather inviting, all things considered. I'm glad I chose to live here, even if I had to bear witness to these strange and brutal encounters that Ikki in particular had to endure.\\n\\n\r\nI can only imagine what he felt like during some of these epic fights. Given how much fun he had occasionally with these, I can almost see him purposely distort the view with interesting colors and whatnot to accentuate the intensity of these battles. He likely did that whenever he was being tortured, like he was throughout the past few weeks. I can just imagine him pouring his strength, his eyesight, imagination, and soul into this final battle you no doubt witnessed, after all the pain and suffering he went through during his life and especially recently, just to get this far. The whole world was stunned at this final confrontation, as well as the exchange we had afterward, and it was one of the best moments of my life. We may have rushed into things, and we may have been a little blunt to each other, but I am having a wonderful time with Ikki and all of my new friends. I hope to hear what you think of me now, and what you think of us after what just transpired. I give to you, my fondest regards, as I wait for the day I see you again.\\n\\n\r\nYour precious and capable princess,\\n\r\nStella Vermillion",

            "content": "Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry - after reading the synopsis and seeing the cover, doesn't it make you think it's yet another uninteresting and low quality light novel adaptation about a \"worst\" student and his harem, taking place in a magic high school?\r\nThat's not exactly what Rakudai is.\r\nThe start might not be so convincing, but already after the first episode I knew I would stick with this anime till the end. What makes Rakudai stand out, is that it's really trying to be a little different. And the outcome is pretty good. At first, this is something we know very well already. We get our protagonist,Ikki, who is known as \"the worst one\" and has no magical skills. The main girl is a pink-haired tsundere, Stella, who is an A-rank student and princess of another country. How do these two meet? Of course, he walks in on her in her underwear, yet his reaction was not something you usually see in Your Typical Light Novel Adaptation. And this isn't the only scene when Rakudai does that - it uses well known schemes but does it in a pretty refreshing way. I wouldn't call it the most unique anime ever, but does it really need to be very original when it can still be somewhat refreshing and very entertaining while relying on a base we're familiar with?\\n\\n\r\nWhat is also worth mentioning is that this is not a harem show! Yeah, really. After the first 2/3 eps there were people making sarcastic comments about it, but they could shut their mouth after a little while. The development of main characters' relationship is sweet to watch and adds to this anime. Rakudai doesn't focus on romance that much, but it's there, it's noticeable and it is nice to follow. More female characters appear, but Ikki isn't their love interest (there is one exception, which is his little sister, but no worries, this aspect is also handled well and shouldn't be found annoying even by people that dislike this kind of characters).\\n\r\nCharacters are likeable, they aren't unique but they're still fun to watch. Also opponents are more interesting than they usually are in Your Typical Light Novel Adaptation!\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so since this is a \"sword action\" anime about magic knights, there must be a fair amount of battles. There are battles and they are really well done! They aren't short but don't feel too long. The animation is smooth and the battles are full of details. They are really exciting and great to watch! You might even find yourself rewatching some fight scenes - so did I. \\n\r\nNot only fight scenes are so well done. This show offers really neat art, there are many details, it's rare to see noticeable deformations in the background, the animation is always smooth and also the authors sometimes used different styles of animation - which turned out really well imo and is yet another thing about this anime that makes it stand out. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that makes Rakudai better than Your Typical Light Novel Adaptation is the fanservice! I found it splendid. Sometimes Rakudai goes where most series of this kind don't have the balls to. And the expierience is even nicer because of the great art. It might not have that much fanservice, but it is of incomparably better quality than it is in most shows of this kind! And it mostly focuses on our beautiful Stella (who is not only good looking, but can be also sweet, supportive and seductive).\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack doesn't stand out that much but it doesn't disappoint either. It's just good. The opening song is really great though! Fresh and catchy. Definitely one of my personal favorites. The ending song is by my beloved Ali Project so I obviously enjoy it too. For those that don't like Ali Project's music, there is a beautiful and fanservicey animation.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime does the same thing its protagonist does - it might be labelled as bad since the beginning by some, yet it really tries and the outcome is very satisfying. Sometimes you might even feel like they tried too hard (example: episode 11) but don't you like it better when they try very hard than when they don't really care?\\n\\n\r\nRakudai Kishi no Cavalry is a well done anime. Even if it might look generic at times, there are things about it that make it feel more fresh and stand out. As a fan of this kind of series, who appreciates interesting fights, good art, quality fanservice, a bit of originality and actual effort put into the show, I enjoyed Rakudai a lot.\\n\\n\r\nIf you expect good action, smooth and detailed animation, a bit of romance and some high quality fanservice and don't mind a harmless amount of well handled generic tropes - you might really enjoy it. It's also worth mentioning that Rakudai gets better with time, the beginning is just slightly above average but in later episodes I just fell for this anime!\\n\\n\r\nIf I weren't a fan of this kind of anime I'd give it a solid 7, but since I am and every aspect that I like in anime was handled really well in this one, I'm giving it a 9. It was real fun and if another season ever comes out I'll be the happiest.",

            "content": "As clich\u00e9d and by the number as Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry presents itself, it also seems to be an anime that challenges its own status constantly. By looking at its plot summary and art direction, you would be forgiven to toss this series along with the generic crap that piles the charts of every season. With that in mind, what could be then a valid reason to give this show the merit of a review?\r\nWell, I\u2019m glad you asked, little voice in my head, let me explain.\r\nStory and Characters\r\nFrom any angle you look Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry (this one is quite the mouthful, I\u2019m gonnacall just Rakudai for short) is following the clich\u00e9s of the Sorcery School genre so strictly it seems as if it has a checklist of the tropes required. We have:\\n\\n\r\n-the hardworking but underestimated protagonist who happens to be somewhat oblivious to girls affections;\\n\\n\r\n-the pink-haired upstart tsundere, largely known for being among the most talented and powerful on the student body;\\n\\n\r\n-the Imouto character, whose main purpose is to give the series its incest undertones;\\n\\n\r\n-the playfull and not-at-all subtle homosexual side-character who just so happens to be someone you should not underestimate;\\n\\n\r\n-the one-off enemy that is going to be discarded for the sake of raising the protagonist;\\n\\n\r\n-a setting based on a school with modern aesthetic, that teaches its students about the handling of magical abilities;\\n\\n\r\n-a tournament centered plot were the main characters bet their academic future and pride.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what makes Rakudai an interesting beast to tackle is how it seems to be at odds with its own clich\u00e9d nature. The series displays a weird brand of self-awareness where it doesn\u2019t necessarily belittle or parodies such tropes, but seriously plays them to the best of its abilities. Mostly. You can see this manifested in how the characters are presented and treated, going back and forth between the predictable instances of their archetypes and legitimately thought-out character moments.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the easier one, Ikki, the protagonist and Failed Knight of the translated title, who starts as an underdog but reveals to be actually pretty strong. Surprised? Neither am I. Granted, the series doesn\u2019t make him simply a powerhouse for poorly established reasons or goes out of its way to avoid any kind of tension during battle, it shows him as a deeply hard-working individual who struggles against tough enemies, even showing that his strongest moves have their limitations, so a Kirito he isn\u2019t, thankfully. In some instances the writing even makes fun of how quickly he becomes popular among his schoolmates. Personality-wise, he was given a sense of humour and empathy, enough to make him likeable and play well with the other figures. \\n\\n\r\nFollowing is Stella, the resident tsundere. Now, even being a staple of anime, the tsundere archetype is a tricky one to write. Doing it right, the tsundere can develop into a well-rounded and likeable figure, in the molds of Taiga or Meryl Strife. Doing it wrong though, the results add the potential extra-damage of being not only a poorly-written character but also an awful individual as a whole, ruining the chances of the audience connecting or growing to like the character. \\n\\n\r\nSo how does Stella fair? Let\u2019s take a look at the first episode before anything else: for once, after the obligatory accidental peeping scene, she is introduced in a comedic sequence so that it\u2019s easier in get accustomed to her demeanor. Following that we\u2019re shown her motivations for being in the story and the episode ends by displaying her kinder side towards the protagonist, while not in his presence mind you. Now, I think this is noteworthy effort, because far too often writers only worry about introducing the tsundere by her aggressive traits. Introducing Stella in this manner helps to understand that all the traits presented are natural sides of her personality that don\u2019t conflict with each other. Later, when in her tsun-side, she acts more flustered than abrasive, making the transition to her dere-side natural.\\n\\n\r\nNow, one common practice to make the tsundere likeable to the audience is to give her a quirk, so what would it be for Stella? She\u2019s horny. No, really, the majority of the initial sexual tension between her and Ikki comes from her desire for his body.\\n\r\n--[Minor spoiler ahead}--\\n\r\nThis later takes a different form when their relationship develops and leads to their most interesting moments as a couple. Being Stella a more sexually forward individual than Ikki, the two have to work out their expectations in regards to the relationship, strengthening their bond and ultimately providing better understanding of where their morals lie on. All that aside, it's unexpectedly refreshing to see a light novel adaptation having teenagers deal with such a strong subject like sex in a tasteful manner.\\n\r\n--[Minor spoiler end]\u2014\\n\\n\r\nThe Imouto in the series is also played in that strangely self-conscious manner. Usually this archetype is used to give incest undertones to the anime, here it\u2019s not at all in undertones. She starts her role by kissing her brother in front of other classmates, openly declaring her love so that everyone can hear it and playfully talking about sleeping together. I realize this might be a problem to some, but as long as it doesn\u2019t devolve into tasteless pandering I appreciate when a series cuts the bullshit and plays with a trope.\\n\\n\r\nNow and then, Rakudai has these strange moments that handle plot points in a way that could be classified as meta-humour, although this might be a dangerous statement to make. I say it can be seen as meta-humour because they play with expectations the viewer creates after having already seen similar situations. We\u2019ve seen new characters end an episode talking about fighting the protagonist, so we expect them to be a future threat, not the punchline for a joke (which, you might notice, was a wasted opportunity for more effective build up, not gonna lie), and we\u2019ve seen countless anime feature pool/beach episodes, so we expect them to have pointless fanservice and dumb hijinks, not legitimate character development.\\n\\n\r\nAround episode 6 you\u2019ll probably notice that this series is more focused in interactions than in any on-going main conflict. While the interactions are nice to watch and even charming from time-to-time, it leads to one of the main problems with the series: it introduces characters that play their arc but might get forgotten in the long run. Some adversaries, for example, become throw-away characters and might as well be classified as filler. Being this only the first season, Rakudai might be trying to pull a \u201cIndex\u201d and stack up in characters that become recurrent in the long run, which is a better option but comes with issues of its own.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\\n\r\nThis I\u2019d say is the anime\u2019s most glaring weak-spot. Rakudai uses the style that is  by now a given for light-novel adaptations of this genre, which in some instances can make the series indistinguishable from other titles: figures use futuristic-looking uniforms in white and black shades with minimal variant details, scenarios are mostly light colored, with the exception of battle stages, presented in dark tones of green and blue, powers are undetailed but given noticeable lighting, etc. \\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for character design: Ikki is thin, has dark and spiky hair; the tsundere has pink hair tied in ponytails, large, soft and bouncy breasts (I won\u2019t complain about that!); the Imouto is flat-chested and carries a uniformly bland color pallet; the supportive gay friend is fabulous. Being a Silver Link series, though, it\u2019s nice to see it was done by the side of the studio that understands contrast, so we luckily don\u2019t have a Chaos Dragon this time. Seriously, that show looked awful!\\n\\n\r\nOn action sequences there are issues with framing: a lot of attention is given to the special powers, but they take too much of the scene, and adding it to the manner in which those sequences are cut, makes for somewhat disjointed and hard to follow action. On a plus side, when the focus is on character movement it\u2019s very fluid and pleasant to look at, mainly during swordfights. Wow, here I go being boring again!\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is interesting because the visuals have a slightly gritty vibe to them, but the song sounds not really upbeat, but energetic and stimulating, possibly to evoke a competitive thrill going into the anime. The ending is a slower, somber piece accompanied by some\u2026 enticing visuals. Can\u2019t go wrong with that.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal ramblings\\n\\n\r\nRakudai Kishi no Calvary was a show that played constantly with my expectations. At many points it seemed like it was going into shit-territory with its setup, just to pull it back and make a fool of me by presenting a legitimate good and entertaining moment. I can say I had an equal amount of enjoyment from watching the show as well as I dissecting it.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many factors that can make a work for me, but hardly ever break it. One that is fundamental to me and can easily do both are the characters. Bad characters can sink a series with good premise and waste solid potential, as well as good or even great characters can help a work with a tired premise to rise above mediocrity, even if it doesn\u2019t mean becoming a landmark for its media, but just a solid piece of entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nThe saying \u201cdon\u2019t judge a book by its cover\u201d seems to be getting increasingly meaningless as it has become easier to spot a generic, effortless and vapid cash-grabs in the current anime scene, so it\u2019s really pleasant to find once in a while a show that throws you for a loop and is worth looking at and analyzing. \\n",

            "content": "Have you ever been disappointed by something that you didn't have high expectations of in the first place? If your answer is \"no\", then you have yet to attend a high school and/or watch Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry. Some time during the Fall 2015 season, I had gone about a month without watching any anime because reasons, and the only shows I'd been watching were two shows I knew about already and one that was somewhat of a recommendation; therefore, I ventured off into uncharted territory and picked this up, seeing that it was the most-watched show outside of One Hype Man and some sequelsto things that I already watched. Looked like some general action series, wouldn't hurt to try.\\n\\n\r\nWho could've predicted such tragedy?\\n\\n\r\nAll aboard the spoiler hoard!\\n\\n\r\nAt two minutes and thirty seconds in, I elicited my first groan. Around the three-minute mark, I stopped taking it seriously altogether. It COULD'VE tried redeeming itself, but by the time it apologized and tried to act mature, it'd already pissed the bed, tripped over its own shoelaces, spoiled dinner, drove the family dog mad, and heard daddy's car drive away for the last time. Oh wait, that's a spoiler, isn't it. Whoops.\\n\\n\r\nThat's my biggest problem with Cavalry. It has so many cringe moments that I couldn't find the capacity to take it seriously, no matter how hard it wanted me to. Here's what I mean: the one particular element of this show that apparently brought about its success about is the romance between the two lead characters. No, this isn't the worst relationship in the world, but I wish the two would quit fucking around with themselves and act like real people. Here's some advice for both sides: Gentlemen, if you find yourselves taking a shower, and your female friend invites herself in and rubs her bare tits on you, she wants to fuck and probably a marriage. There's no other explanation, unless she's the biggest cock-tease in the galaxy, in which case lol. And ladies, if you're the one inviting yourself to take a shower with your male friend and he doesn't make a move after you rub your bare tits on him, find a new man to cling to. He obviously doesn't want you or is too stupid to take a hint. I don't want to hear anything about \"awww but he/she's being modest!\" They're 16. They have hormones and do stupid things, we've been and/or known these people. But after such extreme encounters, everyone forgets that said event never happened, or something.\\n\\n\r\nIf Cavalry had any self-awareness or didn't try to be dramatic, I could've at least acknowledged it as some cheap harem only created as fap material, but I guess that doesn't rake in as many dollars as a show containing something that resembles a serious plot. But really, the penultimate episode in particular was so dramatic and intense that I just couldn't understand what the hell I was actually watching. This is the show with an incestuous loli and a girl who got dripping wet while training so she can restore her family's honor? Huh??? ...Wait, is this Monogatari? What the hell is going on here?!\\n\\n\r\nAnd that leaves me with no choice but to talk about the plot. Well, frankly, there's not much to say. Some scrublord named Icky transfers into a prestigious school and is required to be basically the best student just to pass and for daddy-senpai to hopefully notice him because too much of an asshole otherwise. Despite Icky being dubbed as \"Worst One\" and having a terrible rank, he's an adept fighter because the school's system is shit because daddy-senpai is too much of an asshole, so this is about how he becomes \"Best One\" instead, or something. Along the way, he ends up interacting with other people and gets involved with some romance, and there's a somewhat interesting plot twist towards the end, but I've already said that I couldn't take them seriously. (Plus the twist makes little sense. \"So you're apparently doing really well in school. THAT IS MEDIOCRE!! I HAVE NO SON!!!!!\")\\n\\n\r\nIcky himself is some generic, forgettable character who serves as your projector screen. Do you want to become the swagnificent new kid in school who literally creates an army of girls and gets a hot girlfriend? Photoshop your face onto his and feel good about yourself. Stella is waifu bait, made only so young boys can hold her close to their hearts. Well, they'll hold something, anyway. She becomes Icky's servant or something because fanservice and has some tsundere side that's more annoying than endearing; again, Stella does some ridiculous shit in an attempt to get Icky to notice her, yet she tries playing these things off. She goes way too far down the rabbit hole but tries escaping anyway. It's not working.\\n\\n\r\nThese two become lovers before too long. I must admit that this relationship is surprisingly decent. I thought this would be very annoying and subtle with the two either never hooking up at all or only saying they're in a relationship without doing anything, with the cour's final scene being a long-awaited kiss. Nah, it's actually better than that. They have some legitimate moments together and their relationship develops in an interesting way; after it actually starts, they don't seem like a couple, but they take notice of this and work on it. I thought that was pretty effective, but the scene itself is another awkward, headache-inducing montage of dialogue that more-or-less runs around in a few circles before getting to the goddamn point. I didn't exactly enjoy their screentime, but the outline of their relationship was good.\\n\\n\r\nBack to the characters. Cavalry's side characters are a hilariously awful group of bumblefucks; I'll mention the incestuous loli again because, yeah, that's a thing. They even try justifying it! She talks about how/why she acts so affectionate towards Icky, but apparently no one told her that FAMILY MEMBERS DON'T FUCK EACH OTHER! Cavalry, are you trying to tell me something? Are you telling me that I, the only brother to three siblings, should agree to this? The reverse-trap enables this and, yeah, there's a reverse-trap in here who has no personality or development whatosever. It's only funny for a second. I think there was a furry at some point, too. Should I mention the Gary Oak character? There's some douche who acts like a douche to Icky because we, as the audience, should feel bad and have feelings or something. Then he gets beaten like a bitch and I guess this is supposed to be satisfying??? It was super overdone and cringe-worthy. (At least he didn't show up to act like a bitch again.) Ayase has a pretty funny backstory, but it taught me a valuable life lesson: If you want someone's house, beat the shit out of them in order to obtain it. Apparently that's a thing in this place. She demonstrates how serious she is about restoring her father's dojo by getting dripping wet when Icky tries to help her. What a warrior! The only normal character I could actually enjoy was the Director lady, whatever her name is. She's kind of serious but troll-ish, like she's aware that she's in a bad anime but has accepted her fate.\\n\\n\r\nIf I forgot anyone worth mentioning, please notify me via junk mail, because it's probably a garbage character anyway.\\n\\n\r\nSo, was there anything I actually enjoyed beyond a superficial level? Yeah, turns out Cavalry doesn't want me to rate this a 1/10. The art is quite nice with some pretty standout moments.  For one, I enjoyed the opening's style, which is one thing that drew me to this anime. That style returns in the last two episodes and is executed very well. Icky's prison scenes looked appropriately desolate and grim while the cour's final fight had an iconic feel to it. This style amplifies in the dramatic penultimate episode and plays out like Shaft made a guest appearance, though it was probably my general lack of interest that kept me from really enjoying it. There are some really shitty-looking rock monsters late in the anime, though. But overall it's pretty good, so at least you'll get some good action, though little of it was memorable beyond the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is another story. I'll tell you that it has a pretty good OP and a pretty good ED, but the rest of the soundtrack has completely escaped me. I can't remember anything about it, so that tells you how good it isn't. Being unmemorable is better than being memorably bad, though.\\n\\n\r\nThat's about it. Congrats, Cavalry, I hoped to watch something that would just help pass the time and not piss me off very much and instead you instead made me regret not getting hit by a car instead. I'm probably considering this to be the worst anime of the year as far as I know, because at least Danmachi and Asterisk didn't make me uncomfortable with any stupid incest. Painful fanservice, generic concept/setting, laughable characters, it's not something I'd recommend to someone, even if it were to purposefully tease them.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the above text more-or-less applies to The Asterisk War, minus the actually good parts.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 2/10\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nSound - 4/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 1/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1/10\\n\r\nOverall - 3/10\\n\r\nFavorite character - Can't remember her name, don't care enough to look it up.\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 11\\n\r\nRecommended to anyone that liked The Asterisk War because it's literally the same thing.\\n\\n\r\nEDITED ON 3.14.16: I changed the score to a 3/10 because I feel that a 2/10 is only bare-minimum; Cavalry has some legitimate strong points and doesn't deserve that rating.",

There is also another similar anime that was airing at the same time, Gakusen Toshi Asterisk. Now, Gakusen is... umm to put it straight... bland. But I really can't pinpoint why Rakudai Kishi is at least twice as good than Asterisk. \r\nMy enjoyment level was so high that even I was surprised. If One Punch Man wasn't airing this season, I really would put this anime as my number one in pure enjoyment, not story wise, charactersor animation/sound but just in terms of enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is really not that difficult to grasp. You can sit back without having to think too much and get the general idea of where it is headed. The love story is also the same. You have a generic tsundere princess but she is so much more likable than the norm. She is tsundere done right! Our male protagonist is also the same old. He has personality traits that I probably have seen at least 50 times in male leads but again, he is so much more likable than the norm! Besides, he is one cool son of a... yeah. And for once, he isn't indecisive and settles with one girl even though it can be seen as a harem series which is a breathe of fresh air. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation was something that was impressive for an anime of this level. I mean with their budget, I think the studio did a damn good job especially at those action scenes. They added few interesting animation tones here and there that I haven't really seen other anime do. It just feels like the creators actually enjoyed creating this and put in extra efforts to make it awesome. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I am still confused to why I enjoyed it this much. But whatever, with what it had going for itself, it did a damn good job. And I sincerely hope it gets a season two. \\n\\n\r\nPS.

TheAction scenes had real build-ups, clearly defining the reasons for all characters wanting to win their battles to reach the final tournament, thus making the fights feel more personal. The powers displayed aren\u2019t ground-breaking by any level but the way they were performed brought a lot of excitement to them. The love story also took me by surprise which is a rarity in such anime\u2019s, so it was enjoyably refreshing. The Romance may have started on a corny note, but it gets well-developed by launching it on a slow pace. The characters don\u2019t just fall in love with each other, rather they are confused by their own feelings and convincingly approach their confession of desires to each other on a more natural note. So, towards the end, I genuinely bought their relationship as I had witnessed an authentic chemistry between them which is worth rooting for!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters introduced look generic, but the anime lets their personalities to shine in order to stand out. The MC has a noble and hardworking attitude mixed in with a kind and tolerable demeanour that splits the fans on whether liking him or not! (I frustratingly found him \u2018Too Nice\u2019 at certain points!) He\u2019s disclaimed by his family and nicknamed as \u2018The Worst One\u2019 for his lack in magic skills yet it\u2019s his perseverance and desire to fight back that makes him very interesting. Despite showcasing tremendous set of skills like \u2018Perfect Vision\u2019 or his fight style, he is portrayed as an underdog in a believable fashion. (His powers are cool but limited!) What makes him a unique character is the situation he is put in and especially how he faces it! He strives when the odds are stacked against him, he enjoys turning unfair circumstances to his advantages, he revels in such environment because he believes it makes him stronger and this is the reason why he grabs people\u2019s attention so quickly. (Whether it\u2019s in a good way or a bad way!) Stella is our tsundere princess with a fire wielding sword who doesn\u2019t get a lot of screen time but manages to leave an impression by developing into a motivating character due to her romance angle. And while Shizuki is very badass with water manipulation powers, her self-devotion to Ikki and brotherly love was a total No No! She did start to change at the end by learning to act more like a sister than a lover with the help of her Not So Straight friend, Alice.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is noticeable and colourful enough to give a clean look but the real stand out is the work done on the backgrounds. Different shading and colours were given to specific situations, further establishing the distinctive temperament of the show, whether it\u2019s the warmth glow you get during flashes of Romance or the bleak monochromic setting with shades of red and blue to further symbolize the show\u2019s dark and depressing moments, they perfectly nail the atmosphere of the story. The same kind of care is seen with its animation as well since you watch the fights in clear cut angles and smooth fluidlike motions, sporadically dabbing with cool slow-mo shots which are pleasantly detailed and gorgeous to watch! THE OP is very bad, not in terms of its music or even the video attached to it, rather it\u2019s their choice of the singer who completely ruins it! However, the soundtrack plays as a great companion piece for the show since its pleasing to hear and helps elevate the scenes accordingly. The OST is a great harmonic mix of Jazz, Rock, Piano, etc. that can be listened to as a standalone piece due to its soothing, diverse and upbeat nature. (\u201cTension Feeling\u2019\u2019 happens to be my favourite one!) Regarding Voice Acting, the dubs were fine while the subs had more feel to it, but both are serviceable.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m glad to stick with this show since it does its job by impressing me even though it brought nothing new to the genre, still to my surprise it didn\u2019t follow the projected route I was thinking it was going to take! Though attaching Ecchi to some serious scenes actually hurts the show as it cheapens whatever they were trying to accomplish, but I did enjoy the few clich\u00e9 breakers here and there. However, in the end the anime manages to charm you with its firm handle on Action and Romance, thoroughly entertaining me with brilliant fights and making me care and root for the lovebirds! I would have liked to see Stella fight more and I wish the final arc had been stretched a bit more. In addition, this anime neither needs to be a Harem or an Ecchi so I hope to see less of it in the next season. It\u2019s definitely worth a onetime watch at least.",

That, combined with the super high quality animations is a sure joy to enjoy!\r\nThe MC has been through a lot, which shows during the entire anime. The MC has shown incredible feets but also not so incredible ones. Why is a strongMC called the Worst one? Well, you'll understand when you watch the anime!\\n\\n\r\nYou could say that this anime has an harem going on too, but is that really true? \\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of side characters, but the ones that really stick to the MC are easy to see, yet not so easy to figure out, nor understand. There's been put thought into that and due to that, some of the side characters might even seem more powerful than the MC himself! Also, there are a few totally mysterious characters which are kind of hard to figure out due to them being unexpectedly strong yet, they show their strength barely in public.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance part plays a big role in the story as it really connects viewer to what the MC actually thinks.\\n\\n\r\nToo bad, I can't say much more than this otherwise I will spoil you too much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy the watch!\\n\\n\r\nP.S.

            "content": "Word Count: 1735 words (5 pages double spaced)\r\n*Spoiler Free*\r\n[Why should you watch this?] Because it\u2019s the biggest breath of fresh air to the high school battle harem genre in quite some time. \r\n[What should you expect?] Awesome fights, a romance that actually goes somewhere, a very likable and respectable MC, a fantastic red-hair tsundere, a great cast of characters, a straight forward story, some decent villains, and some good fanservice here and there.\r\n[Where can you watch it?] You can watch it legally on Hulu (I wish they could have shared it with Crunchyroll or even Daisuki, but oh well!).\r\n-------\r\nIntroduction (skip this section if you justwant to get to the actual review): Honestly my feelings won\u2019t be hurt if you stopped reading the review after the short intro above or if you saw the word count and was like, \u201cNo way in hell am I reading that much!\u201d That is why I put it there, to give you context of what my review has in store and how long it actually is. It\u2019s your decision if you want to truly want to commit to reading whole my review or just get the highlights. Either is fine.\\n\\n\r\nNow my reviews aren\u2019t going to be how you normally find reviews on MAL. I don\u2019t score everything individually, my review talks about everything in unison with no specific structure and I sure as hell will not being doing a recap of the synopsis. The synopsis is right there at the top of the page, you don\u2019t need me to regurgitate that for you (ha!). Now since you know what to expect, please, consider giving my review a chance! If I convince at least one person to check out this show because of my review, I\u2019ll consider it a success. \\n\\n\r\n--------\\n\\n\r\nThe Actual Review: Chivalry is special title for me this season. Looking at the surface, it has everything that western anime fans usually despise nowdays: a high school battle school setting, a redheaded tsundere, an underrated MC that\u2019s actually really strong, and what looks like a stereotypical harem in the making. However, Chivalry uses all these tired and true tropes in such a way that is not only refreshing, but also bold. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with our main heroine, Stella. Stella has got to be one of the best tsunderes to come out of a battle harem show in some time, actually I\u2019d go as far to say, probably one of the best tsunderes out there. Definitely not as deep as tsunderes like Rin Tohaska (my personal favorite) and Asuka Soryu, but she is developed nonetheless. More so, it\u2019s her personality that really draws you in. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a tsundere that has balanced tsun and dere so well (Lucia from Rewrite would be a good contender however). Stella has a lot more dere than tsun and it will make your inner self squeal like a little girl at least more than once from the cuteness. Stella really grows a lot from the first episode and it\u2019s great to see. Our stuck up, hotheaded princess learns to care for other people and opens her heart to our hero. Stella is never a helpless damsel, but an equal, and is treated with respect. She can stand on her own two feet and does not walk behind our MC, but with him, shoulder to shoulder.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto our hero, Ikki. Ikki is not your average battle harem MC with \u201cundeniable\u201d morals who is cowardly to anything sexual and is annoyingly over-powered and is even modest to his strength acting like he\u2019s some weakling when he\u2019s the strongest there is. No, Ikki takes those horrid tropes and turns them into something that makes sense and maybe even relatable to some. Ikki is a true gentlemen: very honorable, respectful, and kind. In a way, he\u2019s almost like a traditional samurai or knight. Though, in many ways he is still an average guy with the same urges any male would have and that\u2019s what makes him stand out in a good way. Now let\u2019s just get the elephant out of the room here, Ikki handles fanservice moments very well and has some good reactions to them that shouldn\u2019t make you roll your eyes like so many other animes do. It boggled my mind that he was just so normal in his thinking and actions, and that he is also very upfront about his feelings. He is very genuine and true, he never once felt out of character, even in the fanservice moments. Ikki is also not the perfect gem that is just too good to be true. He is someone that is both extraordinary and ordinary, making a good balance without one overcoming the other. In terms of his power, well, I won\u2019t go too deep into that but Ikki works hard for his victories. You learn plenty about his training and what he had to go through, and seeing him fight just makes you want to root him on. He is confident in his strength, but is aware of others\u2019 strength. He doesn\u2019t underestimate his opponents, but he also doesn\u2019t underestimate himself. He is determined and treats each fight with care. Ikki\u2019s goals are a bit complicated and what he\u2019s fighting for is something most people can get on board with. Instead of a MC that seems to be portrayed as some weakling and yet seems to win his battles with added cheap suspense, when we all know he\u2019s going to win, we are instead given a MC that we know is strong despite his title and has to give it his all each battle to win. Each win feels completely fair and deserved, I never once thought Ikki won because of a cheap plot device. Ikki earns his wins and he earns his respect. As I said before, Ikki is not a perfect butterfly and has a few demons of his own that get looked upon in an excellent way. Ikki has great development throughout, just as his female counterpart does, and it\u2019s a great to watch it unfold. \\n\\n\r\nNow onto the actual romantic relationship. Ikki and Stella are my favorite couple of the year without a doubt. It\u2019s so rare to see such a normally depicted teenage relationship in any anime these days that you tend to treasure the animes that do get it right every now and then; Chivalry is definitely one of those rare few. Despite Ikki and Stella having such different backgrounds and personalities, they complement in each other in so many different ways and find the best out of each other. I don\u2019t want to give away too much, but this is a romantic relationship that goes places. It doesn\u2019t have a kiss at the end of the series, and it doesn\u2019t have a kiss and then suddenly all development beforehand is disregarded. No, this show goes far beyond the first kiss and develops the relationship in such a manner that is both realistic and respectable. I\u2019m the type of guy that almost demands sexual contact in a relationship and it drives me nuts when I see so many relationships in animes disregard it completely. Ikki and Stella develop as a couple and the two of them learn from each other how exactly to convey their love. They\u2019re teens that are interested in all the sexual things that every young couple are interested in and worry about the same things young couples would worry about. The fact that they are able to open up to each other and discuss matters that wouldn\u2019t as far as be alluded in other animes is a triumph, considering how rarely it happens. I couldn\u2019t believe how many things the relationship did right, I feel like someone was going to pop up on screen and be like, \u201cNah, we\u2019re fucking with you! It\u2019s all fake!\u201d  No, this show, despite having harem aspects, focuses on one couple and that said couple actually becomes a couple and acts like a couple (I know, weird isn\u2019t it?). It is so simple, but yet so compelling. I can only hope to dear god that more battle harems in the future follow Chivalry\u2019s lead because at the end of the day, most of us just want to see a solid romance without the endless gimmicks.\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice I believe is also used quite well. Fanservice isn\u2019t a sensitive topic for me like it is for so many others it seems. I usually enjoy it, but because I tend to like it, I can also tell the quality of fanservice as well. Yes, there is different qualities of fanservice: good fanservice, semi-good fanservice, average fanservice, bad fanservice, etc. Some people don\u2019t want to believe this and just think all fanservice is bad, but that\u2019s not the case! Anyways, there was some good sexy moments and they never felt overdone, it felt just right and I believe it fit the context of the moment/scene. The character reactions also makes it a lot more bearable. You should like it and find it assuming, there is especially one scene a little later in the series that was just such a damn good and sexy. It\u2019s hard to explain it without actually saying it, but when you get there, YOU\u2019LL KNOW. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the other characters go, I\u2019ll try to be brief as to not completely ruin it for you. They are all very good characters that you\u2019ll care about. Alice is great secondary male, and the other three girls that get major focus all have their different motives and are interesting. They all have their quirks and are quite entertaining. I liked them all very much and thought they were nice additions to the cast. Shizuku cock blocks every now and then, but even those moments can fairly funny. For the most part, I think you\u2019ll enjoy these characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe villains can be quite despicable. I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re cardboard cutouts that we\u2019re used to in so many other harem shows, but they are quite nasty. But some of them actually get development and we see another side to them that will make you think twice about their characters. This show has decent villains, not phenomenal, but definitely above average I\u2019d say. You\u2019ll hate many of them, but you won\u2019t hate them so much because they\u2019re annoyingly evil but because some of them are just true scumbags. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, honestly, it\u2019s pretty straight forward. There\u2019s definitely some family conflicts on the side, but the story is very focused on its one setting and that may be for the best. This is character driven show, the story is gives it direction and that\u2019s all it needs to do at the moment.\\n\r\nThe art and animation are amazing. They\u2019re so crisp and fluid, Sliver Link didn\u2019t hold back on this one. It\u2019s clear which anime got the better budget this season between the two Silver Link shows (sorry 35th Platoon!). The fight scenes are especially well crafted with such intensity in the animation. Legit, this show had some of the best fights I\u2019ve seen all year. The choreography is fantastic and the animation never falls behind. The character designs are also very high quality and I think they look great. \\n\\n\r\nAll and all, Chivalry is a great show and a fresh installment in a genre that is extremely stagnate. It\u2019s so rare do we get such likable main characters in a show such as this and it\u2019s even rarer that said characters actually progress into a developed romantic relationship. Some of you may think I\u2019m giving this show too much credit, but I believe this show deserves my admiration. It didn\u2019t blow minds with being incredibly unique in its setting, story, or characters. Rather, it excelled in its familiar, yet very different approach. Showing us that this genre still has some potential hidden deep inside if writers truly wished to look for it. Chivalry simply takes the tropes we know and loath, and uses them in a way that is both recognizable and new. It doesn\u2019t strive for the extraordinary, but rather using the ordinary in a better way. That my friends, I believe is worth praising. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 (Excellent)\\n",

Where as many will simply discard it as another addition to the list of ever growing bad harem anime. \r\nBut that will be a grave mistake, because amongst the bad shows the good ones get disregarded.\r\nSuch is the case with Rakudai Kishi.\r\nStory wise, it does not do much different, a school setting where students are called Blazers and they battle in selection matches to be selected in the Nationals. Nothing new here, the change arrives with the introduction ofour main leads.\\n\r\nStella Vermellion, an A class top of the class Knight and Ikki Kurogane, a failed F rank knight.\\n\r\nThe character personalities is a common share, what keeps them fresh is the interaction between them. \\n\r\nThe main is not some dumb, dense, perverted idiot, but a super strong, knight who can take on any opponent.

            "content": "Here's my review of Rakudai Kishi no Calvary. I tried my best to make it short, had to actually cut a lot of stuff out (it's still kind of long) but I didn't want to drag it out. \r\nStory {8}:\r\nThe concept of Rakudai Kishi no Calvary is not unique. We've seen it a thousand times before actually. It's a magical school series where students fight against each other in an elimination round style to prove that they're the best in the school. Main Character, who always has a crowd of girls around him for some reason, is labeled one of the worst fighters but isactually one of the best, etc. etc. Just the usual. But something that separates Rakudai from every other series is the actual content in the story; the execution of it. Hidden underneath the introduction of the series is a fantastic anime that makes it more than the typical shounen. \\n\\n\r\nArt {8}: \\n\\n\r\nThe art is a little unique. It doesn't look like your typical anime art, though that doesn't mean it isn't good. The character design is average; the backgrounds are beautiful, and the way it's overall drawn is pretty nice. The art rarely ever falters as well. And in the last six episodes especially, the colors play a unique feat. \\n\\n\r\nSound {8}: \\n\\n\r\nThe music and overall soundtrack of Rakudai is pretty good. The opening is very catchy and won't leave you disappointed. I can't say the same for the ending (the ending sounds like something in a horror anime tbh. It reminds me of Another's opening) but it isn't too bad either. \\n\\n\r\nWhile we're discussing about sound, I should add in that most of the character's voice actors/seiyuus voices really fit their characters. You know those characters who look super badass and mature but their voice is super squeaky like a loli or a child? That doesn't happen in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter {8}:\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are pretty good. Their personalities aren't original or anything and there's definitely a lot of recycled tropes and cliches, but the characters are still enjoyable and nice. \\n\\n\r\nBoth the male and female lead, Ikki Kurogane and Stella Vermilion, are both nice characters. They both trained very hard to get to where they are today, and neither of them are dense. They might be annoying in the beginning, but both of them get character development over the series, making them lovable characters. \\n\\n\r\nThere's some other characters as well, like Ikki's sister, Shizuku, who can be very, very annoying in the beginning of the series but becomes an enjoyable one, and Ikki's friend, Alice, is mostly there to give him support throughout the show. There's also a whole bunch of other side characters too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment {9}:\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. It was quite the pleasure watching of. I loved a lot of things about it; the amazing choreographed fight scenes, the lovely soundtrack, the fact that it's NOT a harem, the extremely cute romance in it, etc. I don't have too much to say as to why I liked this anime, but I just know that I was anticipating for the next episode every week as it aired. In my eyes, it was a totally enjoyable anime and I honestly hope that it gets a season 2. \\n\\n\r\nOverall {8}:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd give it an 8. Personally, I rated this as a 9 on my anime list (since I rate mostly on enjoyment) but if I added in all the other factors such as story, art, etc. then it'd become an 8. \\n\\n\r\nRakudai Kishi no Calvary is a fantastic series, and though it's concept is pretty cliche and overused, the execution of the show is amazing.",

            "content": "Sometimes there is one aspect to a show that can save it from pure mediocrity. It may not try to propel it into the status of \"classic\" or \"greatness\", as there are still other aspects to it that are either okay or bad, but it can still garner it some admiration for trying. Rakudai Kishi no Calvary has the distinction of being one of these shows. As much as my expectations were shrouded in apathy when I started, by the time I was halfway through Rakudai, that apathy dissipated from just one aspect of it that kept me coming back.\r\nThe aspect I'm talking about inRakudai is how the show managed to form what could have been a generic romantic comedy plot and woven it into something that is quite unique, both in tone and writing. The plot involves our two main heroes, Ikki and Stella, that slowly develop a bond at the beginning of the show after they are forced to share a room together at a knight academy. Strangely enough it starts out like your generic romance where the girl acts tsundere towards the male lead, with your standard cliches involving humorous ecchi moments. At that point it's just okay, but then around the middle point of the show it starts to morph into something very remarkable to say the least. We see our couple start to actually act like a real couple would act once they confessed their love towards one another where they would argue constantly and share their feelings through physical or verbal needs. It was a breath of fresh air to see something that I hadn't seen in quite some time. To see an anime couple that actually felt like a couple with an intense love for another. An adorable couple that could be the best anime couple in the past year or so.\\n\\n\r\nToo bad everything else about the plot couldn't quite follow up on how great the relationship building was for Ikki and Stella. It isn't just because it is something we have seen before, the \"set in an academy holding a fighting competition that our protagonist participates,\" but also the fact that everything just feels so superficial and bland from how it is structured. It's almost as if the writers didn't know what to do to make this scenario anymore interesting, so they just tried to create these subplots involving other characters that felt one-note and not thought out well enough. Every time there was an match going on between two characters, all I felt was complete apathy from the whole experience by how badly they built up the plot for me to feel any tension on what the outcome would be. Does not help the fact that the action sequences are not anything to write at home about; not anything terrible or bad, just average to my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the action is not groundbreaking, that has nothing to do with the quality of the art and animation. I have to admit that the character designs are nice and colorful to look at. From the beautiful red hair of Stella that gives a devilish/cuteness aura around her that matches her personality to the supple bodies of all the girls, the art design makes a ton of effort to create a nice distinct look for Rakudai. Even though the animation is not always on point, it is good enough to warrant a passing mark to create a decent framework for the action sequences, despite my under-enthused mood towards them.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, Ikki and Stella are the hallmark of Rakudai and made me keep coming back to the show every week. The other characters, however, don't necessarily have a similar response from me. Most of them ranging on the mediocre to forgettable spectrum of quality characters. Shizuku is one such example that felt like was tossed on the wayside through the majority of the show in favor of Stella. While that does make sense since Stella is the main girl, they still touted Shizuku up as a love rival but they don't really follow up on her much once Stella became Ikki's girl. Again, might seem logical in that respect, however they still attempt to give Shizuku a much needed climatic moment near the end, but by the time I get to that point I completely forgot what the point of her character was. So I was quick to show no interest in anything she did up until the end, just like the rest of the other cast.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an ecchi anime as well, so for those that are still worried of Rakudai steeping closer to generic territory, don't be alarmed. While most of the ecchi fanservice involves our main heroine Stella, that is all the woman you need to tickle your ecchi bone fellas. I found it quite enjoyable to see a girl like Stella, a tsundere at heart, starting to open up, as she and Ikki start forming a romance, to him as a naughty girl. You often see girls like this in hentai saying something this straight forward, not even in the most raunchiest ecchi anime you could get your hands on do you often hear something as blunt as that. Besides the typical washing the protagonist back scenario, some of the ecchi moments come off as borderline heartwarming as they involve a romantic connection between the two main leads. It adds a new flavor to the ecchi mix that made me hoping for more in the coming episodes.\\n\\n\r\nDespite many of the issues I've had with Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, I still thought it was a decent anime to see, oddly enough. I guess you could chalk it up as the relationship plot arc as being so highly regarded by me that the flaws of it aren't terribly huge as it would have been if the Stella and Ikki relationship arc was not as strong. At its worst, it is mediocre. At its best, its good. Its an above-average middle of the road show that will enlighten some and detract others. For me, I just want more girls like Stella-chan to exist in the anime spectrum. Please?\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B-\\n",

            "content": "Rikudai Kishi no Cavalry A.K.A Chivalry of a Failed Knight is a perfect example of the expression \"don't judge a book by it's cover\". Under it's, as many would say, generic light novel anime adaptation look lies one of the most enjoyable and well made fantasy action romance shows I have had the pleasure to watch.\r\nStory: Very Good (8.0/10)\r\nLike most anime series the narrative is told in a continuous fashion, that follows the main character, Ikki Kurogane's, journey from the bottom of his school's ranks to the very top of said ranks while meeting more of his peers that most of time end up becominghis rivals in his rise to the top. It is a pretty easy story to follow but that doesn't make it boring. On the contrary. The very well made cast of characters, fantastic romance*, great battles**, good pacing and few annoying cliches turn an otherwise simple story into a very interesting, engaging and satisfying one. \\n\\n\r\n*personally my favourite aspect of the series with one of the best romances I have seen. It is sweet, cute, and feels every natural and real and it also does something most anime don't do: it talks about the worried that come with dating someone. For example not knowing if it is ok to be lovey-dovey with your partner because of the fear of driving them away.\\n\\n\r\n**great blood-pumping battles with great fight choreography and great animation\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisuals: Very Good (8.0/10)\\n\r\nVisually the anime is pretty high quality all the way through. The animation is consistently fluid, detailed, expressive and clean especially in the fight scenes and the fantastic Opening cinematic which uses primarily red, white and black giving it a very distinct look that makes it stand out from most ops. The character designs are pretty distinct making it easy to tell them apart from each other and they also communicate the characters personalities pretty well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Very Good (8.0/10)\\n\r\nwho ever choose the the voice actors for each character definitely knew what he was doing. Every voice fits perfectly with it's character and every voice actor gives a great performance. The OST is good and fits the show and the OP song is simply great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Really Good (8.5/10)\\n\r\nProbably the best aspect of the show. In the beginning every character seems like your cliched character archetype for box ticking like the tsundere, the incestuous little sister, the gay guy etc. but as the show progresses it is shown just how well written these characters are with believeable backstories and motivation and very likeable and complex personalities which makes most of them really memorable.\\n\r\nThe villains were ok but not the most impressive ones nor the most interesting ones.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Really Good (8.5/10)\\n\r\nreally enjoyed this all the way through and would recommend to anyone how likes a good anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.2/10\\n\\n\r\nWritten on the 3rd of February, 2019",

            "content": "In the seasonal anime approach, on every single one, we will receive once in a while an ecchi and harem with the battle tournament trope light novel adaptation, most likely from one, two or four of them, depending how many they announced in each said season. \r\nThe thing is, for most of the cases, people will go and judge based upon the cover and its setting, the synopsis, etc, even the source being based out of (which I personally find the generalization of the Light Novel Medium being judged upon the genre and setting quite annoying, ridiculous and quite stupid, assuming for a lot ofreasons in the whole generalization would be based upon its adaptation, not its sources materials, but still, they are still doing this and based upon 1 or a few as a whole, and it\u2019s ridiculous). \\n\\n\r\nWhile it looks like a copy and paste of the same old as per usual, the thing that matters is the execution to it, not the things that were made before stated above, since technically a lot of people does this to make the battle tournament, ecchi and harem trope look like some sort of bad thing, when it\u2019s not in the perspective. \\n\\n\r\nThis is something to come across the spectrum of these settings in both the Light Novel and Anime Medium to compare which are better based upon the content being delivered and its direction rather than being judged based upon the statements above this paragraph, since it also gives an idea of a decent qualified series towards a good one worth a watch for the viewer being presented in order to get into these. \\n\\n\r\nIn this season of fall anime 2015, we got two battle tournament, ecchi and harem series which are the names of Gakusen Toshi Asterisk and Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry or by the English names:  A Chivalry of the Failed Knight or A Tale of Worst One. This review will be mainly focusing upon this anime series and my personal thoughts upon it. \\n\\n\r\nDoes it live upon the expectations that I was looking for and could become a treat for people? Or did it failed to deliver what I wanted in the show and becomes as another shallow anime to be forgotten in the pits of hell? Let\u2019s go and find out if it\u2019s actual an actual treat to watch, or it just becomes an unbearable experience to watch during the time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd before I start with my review, I will give a fair warning of two things.\\n\\n\r\nFor one thing, I will just go and give my personal thoughts and perspective without comparing with other shows unless its needed, so if you will have a problem with my personal opinion on the show, feel free to talk about it. \\n\\n\r\nThe second thing being, I will of course kind of spoil some stuff about the anime, just some aspects that I like about this series to defend my statement upon my review and if I do not do it then I might get some sort of problem due to my review. \\n\\n\r\nSo keep that warning upon the words, if you want to stick around with the review then sure let\u2019s go on the road, if not, I would suggest just watch a few episodes and maybe come back to read the review back to know my full perspective of this anime series. It\u2019s a suggestion.\\n\\n\r\nWithout anything behind, let's go to my anime review of Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in a school, where pretty much revolves around magic knights, also modern magic users who fight against each other with weapons converted from their own souls. Our Main Protagonist, Ikki Kurogane arrives to this particular school to actually train these Mage Knights, however he\u2019s more of a failure due to his lack of talent of using magic, labeling him as \u201cA Failure Knight\u201d or also known as \u201cThe Worst One\u201d.  \\n\\n\r\nGetting way less than average marks in the scores, he was forced to repeat another year. However, one day he meets a girl named Stella Vermillion, as she challenged him to a duel due to some \u201cissues\u201d coming around. From that, the duel had some sort of payment, the loser must obey the other for the rest of their lives.\\n\\n\r\nBased upon the synopsis, many would judge upon it to clarify the story is generic. In a way, yes the story is generic to a degree, there are a few reasons why the story itself is quite different than the others, and it doesn\u2019t make it completely special, however it does make the show quite worth a while on its way that could become a treat for a few people.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly one of the few aspects I like about the show would be its romance. To not give much of details of that aspect of the show, the series does establish a well-developed relationship between the two main characters and also establishes a realistic slow pace in order to flesh it out and to make them confront their issues of confessing to one another their feelings, their desires, etc. It gives some sort of realistic approach and direction towards their relationship which seems rather more natural with it's own pacing, which fleshes out their bonds as the episodes passes by. I find it very appealing for the show and it gives some sort of different spark with the plot progression as well. I'll say one thing, this romance is not like one of the best out there though, however it does a very good job executing it and as well giving it a more natural look into it. So in other words, the chemistry on this genre is very suitable and well done in terms of the story department, which is points going forward for the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe Second strong point of the series, would be its battle tournament and their way of doing it. If you take between Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, there is quite a difference between the two. Rakudai\u2019s way of the battle tournament is more of the character\u2019s strength more than the character\u2019s strategy, which with one of the quotes of the show stated in some episodes, each character shows their strength with all the given power they got and that makes it personally, a lot entertaining. It also gives some sort of \"show, don't tell\" around type of approach, in which each battle they technically demonstrate the powers these people have in their hands, while it's not really something new, the way they execute it, most cases of the show its really does a nice job to it. Of course, the series does a nice job into its execution on the fight scenes, and I will appreciate that.\\n\\n\r\nThird thing coming from Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, in each said or so episodes, it breaks some of the clich\u00e9s that usually most ecchi harems have, usually the clich\u00e9s aren\u2019t a bad thing however it does get tiring for a bit after some time. Let\u2019s give one simple example of a clich\u00e9 breaking which is not a big spoiler. In the first episode when usually the main protagonist that enters in the room or let\u2019s say the main female protagonist\u2019s room and the female is actually semi-naked, it ends up as a misunderstanding and the main character becomes really dense as fuck due to it (honestly I love that type of part, for some apparent reason really) and then a lot of mixed up stuff happens. For Rakudai\u2019s case however, that really doesn\u2019t happen when the in before the female lead hits the guy or goes around and say some misunderstanding. After that entrance and almost some misunderstanding shit happening, the main protagonist actually took off his own shirt so they can be equally fine and dandy. Like literally, that was one of the few clich\u00e9 breakers the series has and I was actually shocked by that, not really like oh my god, but I was actually surprised with that, and there\u2019s actually more from that point onward, as the show slowly breaks its cliches and it's really something nice looking, unlike some shows that really do not break these cliches, instead they accumulated more.\\n\\n\r\nFor the fan service department so from what I can tell, it\u2019s really not that much to drag the show into a hell hole. In fact, a few little of the fan service moments of the series between the two main characters works well for the case. For example in one of the few first episodes we get this washing scene which technically the female protagonist washes the MC, however it works because right afterwards she changes later on and can be noticed throughout the show after that. It sounds ridiculous but for me, my personal opinion it actually worked, and for the rest I will say the fan service for others isn\u2019t really heavily focused on that, as I would the show focuses on the battle tourneys and the romance than that, so if you are not a fan of heavy dose of fanservice, then don't worry, this doesn't have THAT much.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally to describe the dialogue for this series in a short sentence, I would say it\u2019s not one of the best dialogues, but it\u2019s not one of the worst dialogues I can say. I had no issues with it considering it\u2019s not supposed to be a complexity series, it\u2019s quite simple and not that much to go and make it ground breaking. That\u2019s a weak point for the story department in a way and to an extension around.\\n\\n\r\nI would say out of these positive aspects of the show, I would say I only had one personal complaint in the anime which still bugged me even today. Which even though it\u2019s not something ground breaking in the series considering it\u2019s quite small and quite nitpicky, this wouldn\u2019t affect the score of the anime overall a lot. \\n\\n\r\nThere was one of the episodes in the battle fight, where basically there was this one little clich\u00e9 moment, which felt out of place and kind of weird in a way to defeat the guy like that. It just felt really out of place for my concern, but it\u2019s not a big issue to say the least, it\u2019s just pointing something out here.\\n\\n\r\nIn the overall story department, I would say Rakudai even though with its generic setting and plot, it still delivers things quite nicely and does a very good job with its execution execution despite these statements above about the judgmental idea other people would have about the show at first sight when it was announced. It\u2019s sort of a treat for anyone that wants something new in a degree (from what I have just mentioned a bit regarding on the romance and would include on the characters). However from coming with this statement saying it would be a treat for anyone that wants something new, this would depend on the viewer at hand. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, this series isn't really for everyone in terms of the story (in terms of the plot) so I will keep a warning towards people. If anything, if you want something rather originally executed and having its own spark, I would suggest this, however this all depends on your own hands and your taste on anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  \\n\\n\r\nThis is another department which is another strong point of the show. While the cast of characters are not really original, since they are all basically your archetype characters, the way they were established and portrayed in personalities wise is done well in this case. They all act in a mature way and at least most of these were developed nicely without any issues having with them. Most of the cast of characters have a motivation to fight and also their strengths can be shown throughout the episodes, which in my eyes the way they show it is very well. \\n\\n\r\nIkki, the main protagonist of the show is considered as the most mature character of the series, technically because in a few situations throughout the series, he\u2019s more of a tolerable, patient and very knowledgeable character in a way. He shows also some determination in one of the episodes to help out when it was needed, and technically also he\u2019s not a dense character either. To say the least this is one of the nicest characters I personally like, and Ikki is a prime example of it. \\n\\n\r\nStella is known as your tsundere, red hair with twin tails, with fire magic and princess archetype. However for her case she does care about Ikki after a few said episodes, and from that her change comes bit by bit throughout the series. Although my only complaint about her is nothing too personal, but I personally would want to see more of her fights with others in a full fight in a way. The last time we actually had that was by the first episode. But she\u2019s overall a nice and loveable girl. Also this is coming as a personal view but \\n\r\nMainly together with the two Ikki and Stella, as I stated before in this review, their relationship with each other feels very dynamic and nicely done, which makes them even more loveable in my personal opinion as a whole between the two.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting cast of character, I will say the one that got most development outside of the established relationship between the two characters, Ikki and Stella, would be Ayase, technically she was one of the most developed characters alone in a way in her arc. She was nicely done in her little arc which I was actually impressed with it. \\n\\n\r\nFor the second it may be Shizuku, while many people would say she\u2019s either fodder or annoying, I personally can see why people could get annoyed by her and hate her, but I personally don\u2019t think she\u2019s all that bad either. She shows some support towards her brother in a way (not in the incest way, not that) and throughout the episodes she does develop as well and does have determination to fight and become stronger. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Shizuku, there\u2019s also her partner which is Alice. Alice is more considered as a supporter for both Ikki and Shizuku in the series, although he doesn\u2019t get any specific spotlight in the battle tournament aspect, he really shows as a supportive character who wants to help Ikki and the others in a way. Also as a personal income, I personally love his character design and voice acting. I will say that as a bonus.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Todo Toka, I will say she doesn\u2019t get as much screen time as the others since she\u2019s introduced at the near specifically almost near the end of the show by being introduced in episode 9 of the show, which is actually saddening considering she shows a lot of strength and proving herself as the strongest female character in here at the moment. However that doesn\u2019t really mean she\u2019s bad in here to say the least I will say that as a bonus. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other cast of members in this series, there are a few of them that don\u2019t get as much screen time as the others, making it look kind of underwhelming in a degree. \\n\\n\r\nA few others gets a few more than the other characters and become more relevant, but in that I will say it\u2019s quite sour mouthing and it really feels like they should have some sort of actual role later on (for those that only get a few appearances) and it\u2019s kind of the disappointment here.\\n\\n\r\nIn the overall characters aspect, this is the other strong point of the anime series based upon the overall curriculum, being the story having a lot more going forward than this, thanks to the other cast of characters excluding the supportive cast feeling a bit underwhelming and could have been done better giving them a sort of relevance later on in the series. The overall cast I would describe the main and support cast as the good part, the other characters being more of the below average part of it.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: \\n\\n\r\nTo describe the art and the animation in a simple sentence, I would say it\u2019s not in all honesty in the masterpiece level, but it\u2019s very eye catching and nicely done in terms of both aspects of the series in this paragraph, along with a lot of things to explain from this. To explain the art firstly, its quality isn\u2019t really one of the best out there, but the studio does a nice job at making the art style eye catching and colorful and at the same time, in its own way. \\n\\n\r\nThe color palette has some sort of pop into the anime that it looks actually very good and it\u2019s nicely catching the eye and clean, also the use a variety of color palettes in different sceneries of the anime that makes it look very appealing for the show. The character designs also look very appealing with the backgrounds of the art of the anime, which I have no issue with it at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe pallets used for the show also were used in the fitting mood of the atmosphere of the series, from the very heart warming rainbow colors and the cherry blossoms flying around in symbol of the love relationship towards the dark shading black and red in one of the episodes, when the use of the colors were the symbol of depression and it\u2019s ominous as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation can be describe in many ways, sure it\u2019s not one of the best animation departments out there of all time, and I am not going to put the show on the masterpiece level of animation department, however it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t say it\u2019s good either. In fact, if I go through this, the animation does take an approach of fluid motion and it doesn\u2019t look even inconsistent, the angles they take for the anime does looks very nice overall, it\u2019s actually very appealing and clean, without any type of ground breaking motion or anything like that. \\n\\n\r\nThey take different directions and angles in order to make the fight scenes look very organized and also another entertaining treat to watch. They sometimes take a slow motion in the anime which looks nice for the anime to do that type of approach to it. \\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes does look very fresh and it doesn\u2019t keep me as the viewer with burning eyes out considering I hate when I see something as bad as Lance N Masques or Mars of Destruction level. In all honesty overall both got a lot of points for giving a treat towards me and it\u2019s nicely, clean and freshly made, with a lot of sparkles in the show and a lot of directions they took into it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character designs I would say they\u2019re not really original, however their designs looks good and without feeling very eye soaring or anything ground breaking towards me. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the art not living to its Light Novel Illustrations as a whole (I have not read the Light Novels yet, but I checked their illustrations and I like it a lot) the anime does a nice job to at least keep its anime designs at most. That will be a bonus from them to that point.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the Art/Animation department is one of the other essential parts of the anime, keeping the show strong and consistent without feeling like its inconsistent, choppy or anything like that along the lines.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound:\\n\\n\r\nNow for the final point of the anime series of Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, the last thing would be the sound department, the music and the voice acting tones. This is probably the component that makes the art and animation very enjoyable with its soundtrack and its sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nTo start off with the music department, the music composer is known as Kotaro Nakagawa, the same person who composed soundtracks such as Code Geass (seasons 1 and 2) which I personally find it very pleasing for Rakudai's soundtrack. The music soundtrack as a whole for Rakudai is considered as pleasing and ear catching, it just makes the fights engaging and also the moments dynamic, entertaining, and enjoyable. To give an idea, I will give you some examples.\\n\\n\r\nOne example being \"Nimrod\" (soundtrack #20) which gives a mixture of a fast paced along with a more jazzy tone by combining upbeat, the piano and along with the trumpets which gives a more dynamic and fitting feel for the fight.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example would be \"tension feeling\" (soundtrack #17) which gives the same tone upbeat but a bit more intense for the moments that are important for the cast of characters, its just soothing at the end which gives a uniqueness of its own (seasonal wise).\\n\\n\r\nMy final example would be \"worst one\" (soundtrack #1) give more of an instrumental composition approach and the tone of the music is just very enjoyable, probably one of my most enjoyable soundtracks of the OST pack Rakudai has released, since it goes to my personal taste actually.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack just goes and give a more enjoyable feel to the series and that\u2019s what makes the show a bonus for me. However, the soundtracks could be considered a little bit overused, but that doesn't mean the soundtrack overall is bad with that standard. It could have been done a bit more to compose more soundtracks in the end except there were a few that were used not so often which is nice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I will say the soundtrack as a standalone is enjoyable and iconic to listen to, along with the anime battle scenes. The soundtracks can be found since it got released around the moment so its easy to be found.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound department, I can\u2019t say the soundtrack is quite the best one I have ever heard, however it does a nice job with its effects in the right time and place, it just makes the show more gripping with the swords clashing and many things to describe.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBy the voice acting approach, considering I am watching the series weekly and in the seasonal, I would say this at least. The voice acting tone fits to their respective characters, I had no issues with that actually.\\n\\n\r\nEach one of the voice actors did a nice job with their performances and making the characters sound a bit more mature at least, and the emotion, etc, does fit nicely in the perspective. Rakudai of course has some few little mediocre voice acting, considering I could say the voices from the other casts (outside of supportive and main cast) do not actually have enough time to get me impressed at least, that\u2019s another point to go for the little while.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Opening and the Ending songs I will say the Opening is quite unique out of the others from the fall season, but not unique overall in the spectrum of the media. It gives a more jazz and upbeat component and it does fit with its visuals, which gives the black and white color palette with the red, symbolizing the blood in some areas. I would personally say, I like the Opening, TV version.\\n\\n\r\nI would say this, for me personally the full version kills in a way the experience I had with the Rakudai Opening. Not that the whole Opening is bad, because music is kind of subjective/personal, but I felt like not hearing the song again.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Ending song of Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, themed performance by ALI PROJECT (the same person that did the performances of Another OP, Code Geass R1 ED1 and R2 ED2, Katanagatari OP2 and ED6 and .hack//Roots ED), The ending for this is composed with a mixture of bits of techno in some parts and the most of it is instrumental, which I personally like the tone of the song, however with its visuals I will say it\u2019s not as creative as the Opening song with the visual standpoint, but it looks nice. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of fan service, since the ED has some shots of the girls naked in still frame and the motion goes from upscale and down. Not a big issue there, but to say the least the song is beautiful in a way. Good Job ALI PROJECT.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nRakudai is one of those shows that may be considered as an overlooked show based upon the synopsis (not that it\u2019s actually underrated, it\u2019s just people skipping this show because of the setting is what I consider overlooked). Yes, it can be generic but towards a degree where its romance and the mixture of the battle tournament trope handled nicely and not ground breaking and nice characters, despite them being generic, shine the show along the way as the episodes passes by.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art would not be one of the best out there of all time, but thanks to it palette and backgrounds, the angles and the colors they use towards the sceneries and the mood displayed also was a nice direction towards the anime series, and also with a nice and eye catching soundtrack that gives a well-deserved complement. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end in my humble opinion, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry had exceeded the expectations I never thought I could find in this type of trope of anime (for my experience), and in my personal opinion, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry got towards the absolute potential and became one with it's actual \"identity\" of it's own. It became something I would actually recommend, if anyone likes the battle tourney trope with something a little sugar on top, which turns into a nice thing to love an enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nIf a second season also comes around, I would be glad to watch the continuation of the show, just because of my statements above and how much I love the show (this is rather personal).\\n\\n\r\nWho should I recommend and who should I not recommend? The answer I will state this simple down below.\\n\\n\r\nI would only recommend this show if you into:\\n\\n\r\n- Generic synopsis but nicely executed\\n\r\n- Straightforward Romance \\n\r\n- Battle Tournaments \\n\r\n- Entertainment \\n\r\n- Simple Story wise \\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend this to people if you are into:\\n\\n\r\n- Something ORIGINAL (in terms of the plot, if you dont like the synopsis/plot)\\n\r\n- Developed Romance (as in the show develops the relationship bit by bit until their confessions rather than going straight forward to it)\\n\r\n- Complex Storytelling",

            "content": "Rakudai Kisihi no Calvary is a show that does a hell of a lot more wrong than it does right, manages to fall into all the typical LN tropes, and still manages to have an incredibly fervent fanbase which thinks that somehow it is an original show which averts many tropes used in LN-adaptations. While I admit that the show manages more right than wrong in one or two aspects, it still manages to be an incredibly bland and generic LN adaptation in the eyes of almost anyone who is experienced enough anime. This review involves spoilers, but honestly no one should care about spoilersin a show this bad. Still, you have been warned. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is basically that Japan won WWII, a hierarchical society of magic users (where magical aptitude is superior to all) exists, and the main character is someone who apparently sucks at magic and yet somehow can conveniently fight on an equal level to some of the best students in an academy that apparently is renown for training magicians. \\n\\n\r\nNo, I did not describe Mahouka to you just now. That is Rakudai. \\n\\n\r\nLet me continue, our female main character is a girl with reddish pinkish hair, who conveniently forgets to lock her door while dressing up (in the very first episode) while the main character walks in. Our main character responds by stripping in exchange to her baring her unmentionables accidentally (something no human being does and is done only for the sake of comedy) and then establishes himself as a fairly reasonable person, complaining because the girl didn't lock the door and that it was an accident.  \\n\\n\r\nSo basically, it's attempting to be witty and breaks any chance of me taking this guy seriously. \\n\\n\r\nThat's without mentioning a character's ability at copying movements (Kakashi from Naruto says hi), the girl using a fire sword (because Shana), our main character having the same conflict as Tatsuya from Mahouka (though he's a lot better than that abomination of a \"character\") and even an Accelerator like character who is randomly and maniacally doing crazy things. That's without mentioning just how absurd some of the powers are (your pupil losing color gives you a power up, really). Like seriously, that's just plain stupid. \\n\\n\r\nThis show may legit be the most uninspired thing I've ever seen in terms of story. \\n\\n\r\nIf only it was just that, but the characters aren't better either. Stella is a generic tsundere, Kurogane is the blank MC with the occasional moment, he has a sister that is in love with him, some side kick that's kinda cool and...do you see where I'm getting at here? \\n\\n\r\nSo. Finally we come here. What is the show's selling point, that drove its fans insane and say that it's so original and distinct from all those other LN adaptations? \\n\\n\r\nThe main duo get into a relationship. \\n\\n\r\nNah, I'm not pulling your leg here. They legitimately get into a relationship, and it's actually handled alright. By alright, I mean that I'm not cringing every time they interact, and it's actually kinda cute on a superficial level...until you realize it's just that, superficial. \\n\\n\r\nEvery single time they interact, the show feels like it's trying to force you to recognize that it's in a relationship like \"OH GOD THEY KISSED\" or \"OH GOD GIRL IS ASKING GUY TO HAVE SEX\" and so on, and it just doesn't feel natural. No one is legitimately this pushy when in a relationship, and people don't endlessly shove their love lives down people's throats. I will admit that there are a few scenes that are legitimately alright (the cabin scene was nice...then the ending blew it) and that it honestly is nowhere near the worst relationship I've seen in anime, but I'm genuinely surprised that this is considered by its fanbase to be the best relationship between two characters in an LN. Toradora? Hyouka? Oregairu? Spice and Wolf? Seriously, this is the best relationship in an LN-adaptation you guys have seen? The characters aren't even that interesting, you honestly can't describe or think of these guys as people (and let's face it, getting them into a relationship quickly may be a nice idea on a basic level, but makes no sense chemistry-wise, we hardly see them get along as friends and boom they're in a relationship). \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is drop dead gorgeous, especially during the fight scenes. The backgrounds look pretty nice, and there are actually some pretty nice scenery shots throughout the show. I just with they were better spent on some other show, because I honestly don't think this show deserves it. \\n\r\nI can't remember any particular track from the OST, though I guess the opening was alright. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I honestly can't say I enjoyed the show all too much, honestly. It's too cliche for its own good, has only one aspect to remember done in an extremely superficial manner, and is just too much of the same as a whole to enjoy. Like sure, I may be repeating myself here, but it's hard not to feel that when you watch this show. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like this show, fine. I hold no grudge against you (unless it turns into another Mahouka) and can totally understand why you'd like it. Hell, I may have liked it if I watched it when I was 14. But honestly, if you're sick of more of the same and just heard that it's unique or original or any other absurd claim, please avoid it. It's not worth your time.",

            "content": "I'll admit at first glance I also noticed it to be both visually and story related to Asterisk wars however as we all may know by now that Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry has more of a erotic, romance, ecchi genre's in it. While watching I found myself to be highly engaged into the action and battles scenes more than the story. I felt bad though because I personally felt that the story was weak. What I mean by that is I felt like there wasn't much of a \"wow\" or \"oh my god how intense\" moment in the story for me. I did however likethe romance between our main characters. Personally depending on what genre a show is, especially in the genre's of action/adventure/fantasy I feel like every guy needs a woman who is either equally or soon to be be equal in strength. A good example of what I mean would be Kirito and Asuna from Sword Art Online. The character relationship no, let me start with this, the archetypes in the story were pretty generic, nothing too unique or special. I feel like we have all at some point watched a show like Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry with the same characters and personalities.  I was not too surprised to Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry turn into a bit of a harem-ish type show based on the elements in the story along with characters. Especially since in most anime's the weakest characters are usually the ones who will become the strongest both psychically and mentally. They are also the ones  most girls in anime usually fall for.  The BGM and soundtrack didn't really stand out too me as much. I didn't really notice the music playing unless it was one the intro and outro songs or if a battle is going on (I would highly recommend you watch and see for yourself.) To contradict myself for a minute, the fights are indeed intense, so just ignore what I said earlier. The art style was your generic mid 2010+ style so lightly drawn face, simple shadows and  different highlights in hair, that sort of thing. Overall I give this show an 8/10 because to me it really did a good job of breaking the barrier of similarities it shares with other shows just like it!",

            "content": "Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry feels to me like an almost desperate attempt to be different. It intentionally utilizes perhaps the most overused setting and premise in the anime industry as of late, and then tries to put its own spin on it in order to make it stand out from the crowd. I say \"attempt\" however, because unfortunately it never quite lives up to its own potential due to having a tendency of not focusing on its own strengths properly, and thus indirectly making it somewhat generic in the end, even though that's exactly what it's supposed to try its hardest to avoid.\r\nThe story takesplace in a magic academy, and it only takes about 2 minutes and 30 seconds into the first episode before the MC, Kurogane Ikki, walks in on a girl, Stella Vermillion, in her underwear. Yeah I've never seen that development before. One thing leads to another, and the two of them eventually end up in an official duel where the loser has to become the winner's \"slave\". Ikki promptly defeats her in style, and thus immediately scores himself a sexy girl as his personal servant before the end of the first episode. Or at least that's the official verdict, but in reality the two of them are quite friendly with each other, and it doesn't take long before a full-blown romance begins to blossom in-between them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is how Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry aims to be special. By this point we should all know what a typical action/fantasy/ecchi/harem magic academy light novel anime adaptation looks like, not to mention how absurdly many there are of them. This series however tries to kick out the harem aspect, and replace it with romance. Like an actual established romance from very early on in the story. That's an incredibly rare thing to find in any anime, let alone an action-oriented one, and it's a quite refreshing thing to see.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters themselves go, Ikki is supposedly the weakest student in the entire school, nicknamed the \"Worst One\" by the pupils. However, this is strictly because he lacks magical skills, but on the other hand his prowess with the sword is second to none. And sadly that ends up being a mostly negative trait as Ikki thus ends up being an incredibly overpowered protagonist anyway, and there is so much plot armor throughout the fights in this anime that it really doesn't have a whole lot of tension in them. That aside he's an all-round good guy who has a lot of fans and supporters. In that sense he reminds me a lot of Shiba Tatsuya from Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, and I can't really consider that a good thing. However, the way he normally acts towards Stella is very respectable I think, and that probably has to be considered the most important thing in the end. Stella herself on the other hand is not only one of the top students in the academy, but also a fiery redhead who is light on the tsun, heavy on the dere. She's a bit too submissive to be my type personally, but I know many people who like her a lot, and she's also got a pretty stunning body. My one problem with her as a character is that she seemingly falls head over heels in love with Ikki in a split second somewhere in-between episodes 1 and 2, but for no apparent reason. As cute as their romance is, I can't help but feel that it started off awfully unnaturally. It almost feels like the author was impatient at getting his dream pairing up and running, and thus he kind of just forced the two of them together in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nOf course those two aren't literally the only characters in this anime, and this is where we find the first of two problems I have with this anime. Namely, why are there so many other girls in here that are not only prevalent, but also in love with Ikki? Like really? First you make such a big deal about how this is a pure romance anime and not a harem, and then you *still* insist on having a bunch of other girls ogling the MC with lustful eyes? What's the point? We already know with absolute certainty that Ikki x Stella is the established main coupling in the story, so why do you have all these other girls as well? Are they there just in order to cater to certain target audiences, despite the fact that those people would know that their favorite girl has already lost the love game before it's even began? Make up your damn mind already; is this supposed to be a harem or not? It's like it's pretending not to be a harem but it actually is one. You can't just both have the cake and eat it, seriously. I mean if they were just there as friends, classmates or whatnot it'd be one thing, or if their feelings towards Ikki are just there in order to create some light love drama and make Stella jealous or something then I could understand it, but that's not the case here. Instead it's literally just for harem romcom shenanigans, which ought to be the last thing Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry should have in it given its premise.\\n\\n\r\nMy second issue with this anime lies with the action elements. Taking place in a magic academy, naturally there is a lot of dueling going on in-between the students. In fact... there's too much of it. Let's be real here, the one thing which Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry has going for it in comparison to other anime with the same setting is the romance. And yet despite that I swear it's spending more time on magic duels than romantic progression. Furthermore, there's still the simple fact that we got a pretty seriously overpowered protagonist in Ikki, so there's very little excitement in the duels themselves since you always know how they're going to end before they've even began. His abilities oftentimes feel like asspulls too as there are numerous special moves of his which are brought out seemingly out of nowhere in order to turn the fight around. There's also this one scene where at one point he's lying nigh-unconscious in a huge pool of his own blood, only to be in top tier fighting condition and kicking ass a minute later. Like really, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that that's simply impossible. The few times where we get to see fight scenes where Ikki is not involved however, then it's actually a lot better. Especially the magic duel in episode 10 was a treat to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the point is that the entire action/fantasy part of the anime feels almost meaningless a lot of the time. It's predictable and most importantly it doesn't really add anything noteworthy to the romantic part of the story at all. It just drags the romance down rather than complement it. Similarly, like mentioned earlier, the pseudo-harem elements are equally pointless, and does nothing but distract from the one thing which you're probably watching this anime for to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you put all that together, what can you conclude? Well, like I said initially, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is an attempt at taking the most overused premise in modern anime and adding a real romance plotline to it. And that's pretty much what it is. But there is no real sense of compatibility in it. The one thing which makes it worth watching is the romance. Almost everything else in it is average at best. So then I can't help but ask, was there really any point in using this setting to begin with? Why do the action, fantasy and harem elements even exist? Why is it taking place at a magic academy in the first place? Because seriously, this story could just have been an ordinary school-life romance anime taking place at an ordinary high-school with no dueling, no magic, no villains, nothing like that. It could just have been a realistic romance story between Ikki and Stella. That's all it's worth watching for as it is, and there'd be so much more focus on that in an everyday setting compared to what we got. It's like the anime is focusing on its own weaknesses more than its strength in its current state.\\n\\n\r\nOriginality is an admirable thing, and I highly respect Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry for trying to be different. But being unique doesn't always mean being better, and in this case I really feel like it wasn't entirely successful. Sure, it's still definitely better than your typical magic academy anime, no doubt about that, but it's definitely worse than what it could have been if it was rewritten into a dedicated romance story in a normal setting. Or if you want a graphical representation of it, then:\\n\\n\r\nPure romance > Romance + battle harem > Pure battle harem\\n\\n\r\nI.E: mixing good with bad certainly makes it better than just bad, but still not as much as just good. So to speak.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, you can say what you want but the ending is pretty satisfying.",

            "content": "To my loving father and family,\r\nI\u2019m sure you're well aware of what transpired yesterday, and I am deeply aware you're eager to know what up to that moment. I understand you, all miss me, and want to know what my life at school was like so far. \r\nDespite what a lovely time I am having, it did not begin this way. When Ikki and I first met, it was embarrassingly rocky for the two of us, even upon getting to know what we each strive for. Some embarrassing incidents occurred that did not help our situations, especially when I met his sister for the firsttime. She\u2019s an adamant one, I'll tell you. Not everyone has the gall to openly insult royalty so consistently, and entirely out of jealousy and overprotectiveness. I understand her situation, however, as learning what she and especially Ikki went through during childhood, even to the small extent I did, disgusted me. Even with how much she irritates me, I\u2019m almost embarrassed about a majority of my early interactions, as I was never as ladylike as my upbringing. I'm still trying to fully get over that aspect of myself.\\n\\n\r\nShe wasn't the only one I met thanks to Ikki. For one, there's Alice, who not only has fantastic fashion sense, but is by far the most mature out of all of us. She even got me hooked on a video game once. There was this really energetic newspaper club member named Kagami who even helped me overcome a major anxiety of mine. A shy but talented girl named Ayase, daughter of the now obscured icon \u201cThe Last Samurai\u201d even hung out with us for a while. Even other people I didn't get to know for too long as in writing this, were fun to hang out with, such as the student council. I did have run-ins with a few despicable ruffians, but not only did we take them down, but one of them turned out to be somewhat interesting with a crazy weapon and mindset. Of course, I handled myself pretty well against these clowns whenever I had the chance, and so did everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nThe fashion is wonderful here, about as much as back home. Alice knows how to get herself and Shizuku into some trendy social clothes and even Ikki has some great fashion sense. The school uniforms are nice as well. The cars look horrible though, but I don't drive yet so that is of little concern to me now. The music these people listen to, while a tad bombastic in places, is fantastic. I love hearing it whenever Ikki and I go on a morning jog. The culture here is rather inviting, all things considered. I'm glad I chose to live here, even if I had to bear witness to these strange and brutal encounters that Ikki in particular had to endure.\\n\\n\r\nI can only imagine what he felt like during some of these epic fights. Given how much fun he had occasionally with these, I can almost see him purposely distort the view with interesting colors and whatnot to accentuate the intensity of these battles. He likely did that whenever he was being tortured, like he was throughout the past few weeks. I can just imagine him pouring his strength, his eyesight, imagination, and soul into this final battle you no doubt witnessed, after all the pain and suffering he went through during his life and especially recently, just to get this far. The whole world was stunned at this final confrontation, as well as the exchange we had afterward, and it was one of the best moments of my life. We may have rushed into things, and we may have been a little blunt to each other, but I am having a wonderful time with Ikki and all of my new friends. I hope to hear what you think of me now, and what you think of us after what just transpired. I give to you, my fondest regards, as I wait for the day I see you again.\\n\\n\r\nYour precious and capable princess,\\n\r\nStella Vermillion",

            "content": "Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry - after reading the synopsis and seeing the cover, doesn't it make you think it's yet another uninteresting and low quality light novel adaptation about a \"worst\" student and his harem, taking place in a magic high school?\r\nThat's not exactly what Rakudai is.\r\nThe start might not be so convincing, but already after the first episode I knew I would stick with this anime till the end. What makes Rakudai stand out, is that it's really trying to be a little different. And the outcome is pretty good. At first, this is something we know very well already. We get our protagonist,Ikki, who is known as \"the worst one\" and has no magical skills. The main girl is a pink-haired tsundere, Stella, who is an A-rank student and princess of another country. How do these two meet? Of course, he walks in on her in her underwear, yet his reaction was not something you usually see in Your Typical Light Novel Adaptation. And this isn't the only scene when Rakudai does that - it uses well known schemes but does it in a pretty refreshing way. I wouldn't call it the most unique anime ever, but does it really need to be very original when it can still be somewhat refreshing and very entertaining while relying on a base we're familiar with?\\n\\n\r\nWhat is also worth mentioning is that this is not a harem show! Yeah, really. After the first 2/3 eps there were people making sarcastic comments about it, but they could shut their mouth after a little while. The development of main characters' relationship is sweet to watch and adds to this anime. Rakudai doesn't focus on romance that much, but it's there, it's noticeable and it is nice to follow. More female characters appear, but Ikki isn't their love interest (there is one exception, which is his little sister, but no worries, this aspect is also handled well and shouldn't be found annoying even by people that dislike this kind of characters).\\n\r\nCharacters are likeable, they aren't unique but they're still fun to watch. Also opponents are more interesting than they usually are in Your Typical Light Novel Adaptation!\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so since this is a \"sword action\" anime about magic knights, there must be a fair amount of battles. There are battles and they are really well done! They aren't short but don't feel too long. The animation is smooth and the battles are full of details. They are really exciting and great to watch! You might even find yourself rewatching some fight scenes - so did I. \\n\r\nNot only fight scenes are so well done. This show offers really neat art, there are many details, it's rare to see noticeable deformations in the background, the animation is always smooth and also the authors sometimes used different styles of animation - which turned out really well imo and is yet another thing about this anime that makes it stand out. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that makes Rakudai better than Your Typical Light Novel Adaptation is the fanservice! I found it splendid. Sometimes Rakudai goes where most series of this kind don't have the balls to. And the expierience is even nicer because of the great art. It might not have that much fanservice, but it is of incomparably better quality than it is in most shows of this kind! And it mostly focuses on our beautiful Stella (who is not only good looking, but can be also sweet, supportive and seductive).\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack doesn't stand out that much but it doesn't disappoint either. It's just good. The opening song is really great though! Fresh and catchy. Definitely one of my personal favorites. The ending song is by my beloved Ali Project so I obviously enjoy it too. For those that don't like Ali Project's music, there is a beautiful and fanservicey animation.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime does the same thing its protagonist does - it might be labelled as bad since the beginning by some, yet it really tries and the outcome is very satisfying. Sometimes you might even feel like they tried too hard (example: episode 11) but don't you like it better when they try very hard than when they don't really care?\\n\\n\r\nRakudai Kishi no Cavalry is a well done anime. Even if it might look generic at times, there are things about it that make it feel more fresh and stand out. As a fan of this kind of series, who appreciates interesting fights, good art, quality fanservice, a bit of originality and actual effort put into the show, I enjoyed Rakudai a lot.\\n\\n\r\nIf you expect good action, smooth and detailed animation, a bit of romance and some high quality fanservice and don't mind a harmless amount of well handled generic tropes - you might really enjoy it. It's also worth mentioning that Rakudai gets better with time, the beginning is just slightly above average but in later episodes I just fell for this anime!\\n\\n\r\nIf I weren't a fan of this kind of anime I'd give it a solid 7, but since I am and every aspect that I like in anime was handled really well in this one, I'm giving it a 9. It was real fun and if another season ever comes out I'll be the happiest.",

            "content": "As clich\u00e9d and by the number as Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry presents itself, it also seems to be an anime that challenges its own status constantly. By looking at its plot summary and art direction, you would be forgiven to toss this series along with the generic crap that piles the charts of every season. With that in mind, what could be then a valid reason to give this show the merit of a review?\r\nWell, I\u2019m glad you asked, little voice in my head, let me explain.\r\nStory and Characters\r\nFrom any angle you look Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry (this one is quite the mouthful, I\u2019m gonnacall just Rakudai for short) is following the clich\u00e9s of the Sorcery School genre so strictly it seems as if it has a checklist of the tropes required. We have:\\n\\n\r\n-the hardworking but underestimated protagonist who happens to be somewhat oblivious to girls affections;\\n\\n\r\n-the pink-haired upstart tsundere, largely known for being among the most talented and powerful on the student body;\\n\\n\r\n-the Imouto character, whose main purpose is to give the series its incest undertones;\\n\\n\r\n-the playfull and not-at-all subtle homosexual side-character who just so happens to be someone you should not underestimate;\\n\\n\r\n-the one-off enemy that is going to be discarded for the sake of raising the protagonist;\\n\\n\r\n-a setting based on a school with modern aesthetic, that teaches its students about the handling of magical abilities;\\n\\n\r\n-a tournament centered plot were the main characters bet their academic future and pride.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what makes Rakudai an interesting beast to tackle is how it seems to be at odds with its own clich\u00e9d nature. The series displays a weird brand of self-awareness where it doesn\u2019t necessarily belittle or parodies such tropes, but seriously plays them to the best of its abilities. Mostly. You can see this manifested in how the characters are presented and treated, going back and forth between the predictable instances of their archetypes and legitimately thought-out character moments.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the easier one, Ikki, the protagonist and Failed Knight of the translated title, who starts as an underdog but reveals to be actually pretty strong. Surprised? Neither am I. Granted, the series doesn\u2019t make him simply a powerhouse for poorly established reasons or goes out of its way to avoid any kind of tension during battle, it shows him as a deeply hard-working individual who struggles against tough enemies, even showing that his strongest moves have their limitations, so a Kirito he isn\u2019t, thankfully. In some instances the writing even makes fun of how quickly he becomes popular among his schoolmates. Personality-wise, he was given a sense of humour and empathy, enough to make him likeable and play well with the other figures. \\n\\n\r\nFollowing is Stella, the resident tsundere. Now, even being a staple of anime, the tsundere archetype is a tricky one to write. Doing it right, the tsundere can develop into a well-rounded and likeable figure, in the molds of Taiga or Meryl Strife. Doing it wrong though, the results add the potential extra-damage of being not only a poorly-written character but also an awful individual as a whole, ruining the chances of the audience connecting or growing to like the character. \\n\\n\r\nSo how does Stella fair? Let\u2019s take a look at the first episode before anything else: for once, after the obligatory accidental peeping scene, she is introduced in a comedic sequence so that it\u2019s easier in get accustomed to her demeanor. Following that we\u2019re shown her motivations for being in the story and the episode ends by displaying her kinder side towards the protagonist, while not in his presence mind you. Now, I think this is noteworthy effort, because far too often writers only worry about introducing the tsundere by her aggressive traits. Introducing Stella in this manner helps to understand that all the traits presented are natural sides of her personality that don\u2019t conflict with each other. Later, when in her tsun-side, she acts more flustered than abrasive, making the transition to her dere-side natural.\\n\\n\r\nNow, one common practice to make the tsundere likeable to the audience is to give her a quirk, so what would it be for Stella? She\u2019s horny. No, really, the majority of the initial sexual tension between her and Ikki comes from her desire for his body.\\n\r\n--[Minor spoiler ahead}--\\n\r\nThis later takes a different form when their relationship develops and leads to their most interesting moments as a couple. Being Stella a more sexually forward individual than Ikki, the two have to work out their expectations in regards to the relationship, strengthening their bond and ultimately providing better understanding of where their morals lie on. All that aside, it's unexpectedly refreshing to see a light novel adaptation having teenagers deal with such a strong subject like sex in a tasteful manner.\\n\r\n--[Minor spoiler end]\u2014\\n\\n\r\nThe Imouto in the series is also played in that strangely self-conscious manner. Usually this archetype is used to give incest undertones to the anime, here it\u2019s not at all in undertones. She starts her role by kissing her brother in front of other classmates, openly declaring her love so that everyone can hear it and playfully talking about sleeping together. I realize this might be a problem to some, but as long as it doesn\u2019t devolve into tasteless pandering I appreciate when a series cuts the bullshit and plays with a trope.\\n\\n\r\nNow and then, Rakudai has these strange moments that handle plot points in a way that could be classified as meta-humour, although this might be a dangerous statement to make. I say it can be seen as meta-humour because they play with expectations the viewer creates after having already seen similar situations. We\u2019ve seen new characters end an episode talking about fighting the protagonist, so we expect them to be a future threat, not the punchline for a joke (which, you might notice, was a wasted opportunity for more effective build up, not gonna lie), and we\u2019ve seen countless anime feature pool/beach episodes, so we expect them to have pointless fanservice and dumb hijinks, not legitimate character development.\\n\\n\r\nAround episode 6 you\u2019ll probably notice that this series is more focused in interactions than in any on-going main conflict. While the interactions are nice to watch and even charming from time-to-time, it leads to one of the main problems with the series: it introduces characters that play their arc but might get forgotten in the long run. Some adversaries, for example, become throw-away characters and might as well be classified as filler. Being this only the first season, Rakudai might be trying to pull a \u201cIndex\u201d and stack up in characters that become recurrent in the long run, which is a better option but comes with issues of its own.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\\n\r\nThis I\u2019d say is the anime\u2019s most glaring weak-spot. Rakudai uses the style that is  by now a given for light-novel adaptations of this genre, which in some instances can make the series indistinguishable from other titles: figures use futuristic-looking uniforms in white and black shades with minimal variant details, scenarios are mostly light colored, with the exception of battle stages, presented in dark tones of green and blue, powers are undetailed but given noticeable lighting, etc. \\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for character design: Ikki is thin, has dark and spiky hair; the tsundere has pink hair tied in ponytails, large, soft and bouncy breasts (I won\u2019t complain about that!); the Imouto is flat-chested and carries a uniformly bland color pallet; the supportive gay friend is fabulous. Being a Silver Link series, though, it\u2019s nice to see it was done by the side of the studio that understands contrast, so we luckily don\u2019t have a Chaos Dragon this time. Seriously, that show looked awful!\\n\\n\r\nOn action sequences there are issues with framing: a lot of attention is given to the special powers, but they take too much of the scene, and adding it to the manner in which those sequences are cut, makes for somewhat disjointed and hard to follow action. On a plus side, when the focus is on character movement it\u2019s very fluid and pleasant to look at, mainly during swordfights. Wow, here I go being boring again!\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is interesting because the visuals have a slightly gritty vibe to them, but the song sounds not really upbeat, but energetic and stimulating, possibly to evoke a competitive thrill going into the anime. The ending is a slower, somber piece accompanied by some\u2026 enticing visuals. Can\u2019t go wrong with that.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal ramblings\\n\\n\r\nRakudai Kishi no Calvary was a show that played constantly with my expectations. At many points it seemed like it was going into shit-territory with its setup, just to pull it back and make a fool of me by presenting a legitimate good and entertaining moment. I can say I had an equal amount of enjoyment from watching the show as well as I dissecting it.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many factors that can make a work for me, but hardly ever break it. One that is fundamental to me and can easily do both are the characters. Bad characters can sink a series with good premise and waste solid potential, as well as good or even great characters can help a work with a tired premise to rise above mediocrity, even if it doesn\u2019t mean becoming a landmark for its media, but just a solid piece of entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nThe saying \u201cdon\u2019t judge a book by its cover\u201d seems to be getting increasingly meaningless as it has become easier to spot a generic, effortless and vapid cash-grabs in the current anime scene, so it\u2019s really pleasant to find once in a while a show that throws you for a loop and is worth looking at and analyzing. \\n",

            "content": "Have you ever been disappointed by something that you didn't have high expectations of in the first place? If your answer is \"no\", then you have yet to attend a high school and/or watch Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry. Some time during the Fall 2015 season, I had gone about a month without watching any anime because reasons, and the only shows I'd been watching were two shows I knew about already and one that was somewhat of a recommendation; therefore, I ventured off into uncharted territory and picked this up, seeing that it was the most-watched show outside of One Hype Man and some sequelsto things that I already watched. Looked like some general action series, wouldn't hurt to try.\\n\\n\r\nWho could've predicted such tragedy?\\n\\n\r\nAll aboard the spoiler hoard!\\n\\n\r\nAt two minutes and thirty seconds in, I elicited my first groan. Around the three-minute mark, I stopped taking it seriously altogether. It COULD'VE tried redeeming itself, but by the time it apologized and tried to act mature, it'd already pissed the bed, tripped over its own shoelaces, spoiled dinner, drove the family dog mad, and heard daddy's car drive away for the last time. Oh wait, that's a spoiler, isn't it. Whoops.\\n\\n\r\nThat's my biggest problem with Cavalry. It has so many cringe moments that I couldn't find the capacity to take it seriously, no matter how hard it wanted me to. Here's what I mean: the one particular element of this show that apparently brought about its success about is the romance between the two lead characters. No, this isn't the worst relationship in the world, but I wish the two would quit fucking around with themselves and act like real people. Here's some advice for both sides: Gentlemen, if you find yourselves taking a shower, and your female friend invites herself in and rubs her bare tits on you, she wants to fuck and probably a marriage. There's no other explanation, unless she's the biggest cock-tease in the galaxy, in which case lol. And ladies, if you're the one inviting yourself to take a shower with your male friend and he doesn't make a move after you rub your bare tits on him, find a new man to cling to. He obviously doesn't want you or is too stupid to take a hint. I don't want to hear anything about \"awww but he/she's being modest!\" They're 16. They have hormones and do stupid things, we've been and/or known these people. But after such extreme encounters, everyone forgets that said event never happened, or something.\\n\\n\r\nIf Cavalry had any self-awareness or didn't try to be dramatic, I could've at least acknowledged it as some cheap harem only created as fap material, but I guess that doesn't rake in as many dollars as a show containing something that resembles a serious plot. But really, the penultimate episode in particular was so dramatic and intense that I just couldn't understand what the hell I was actually watching. This is the show with an incestuous loli and a girl who got dripping wet while training so she can restore her family's honor? Huh??? ...Wait, is this Monogatari? What the hell is going on here?!\\n\\n\r\nAnd that leaves me with no choice but to talk about the plot. Well, frankly, there's not much to say. Some scrublord named Icky transfers into a prestigious school and is required to be basically the best student just to pass and for daddy-senpai to hopefully notice him because too much of an asshole otherwise. Despite Icky being dubbed as \"Worst One\" and having a terrible rank, he's an adept fighter because the school's system is shit because daddy-senpai is too much of an asshole, so this is about how he becomes \"Best One\" instead, or something. Along the way, he ends up interacting with other people and gets involved with some romance, and there's a somewhat interesting plot twist towards the end, but I've already said that I couldn't take them seriously. (Plus the twist makes little sense. \"So you're apparently doing really well in school. THAT IS MEDIOCRE!! I HAVE NO SON!!!!!\")\\n\\n\r\nIcky himself is some generic, forgettable character who serves as your projector screen. Do you want to become the swagnificent new kid in school who literally creates an army of girls and gets a hot girlfriend? Photoshop your face onto his and feel good about yourself. Stella is waifu bait, made only so young boys can hold her close to their hearts. Well, they'll hold something, anyway. She becomes Icky's servant or something because fanservice and has some tsundere side that's more annoying than endearing; again, Stella does some ridiculous shit in an attempt to get Icky to notice her, yet she tries playing these things off. She goes way too far down the rabbit hole but tries escaping anyway. It's not working.\\n\\n\r\nThese two become lovers before too long. I must admit that this relationship is surprisingly decent. I thought this would be very annoying and subtle with the two either never hooking up at all or only saying they're in a relationship without doing anything, with the cour's final scene being a long-awaited kiss. Nah, it's actually better than that. They have some legitimate moments together and their relationship develops in an interesting way; after it actually starts, they don't seem like a couple, but they take notice of this and work on it. I thought that was pretty effective, but the scene itself is another awkward, headache-inducing montage of dialogue that more-or-less runs around in a few circles before getting to the goddamn point. I didn't exactly enjoy their screentime, but the outline of their relationship was good.\\n\\n\r\nBack to the characters. Cavalry's side characters are a hilariously awful group of bumblefucks; I'll mention the incestuous loli again because, yeah, that's a thing. They even try justifying it! She talks about how/why she acts so affectionate towards Icky, but apparently no one told her that FAMILY MEMBERS DON'T FUCK EACH OTHER! Cavalry, are you trying to tell me something? Are you telling me that I, the only brother to three siblings, should agree to this? The reverse-trap enables this and, yeah, there's a reverse-trap in here who has no personality or development whatosever. It's only funny for a second. I think there was a furry at some point, too. Should I mention the Gary Oak character? There's some douche who acts like a douche to Icky because we, as the audience, should feel bad and have feelings or something. Then he gets beaten like a bitch and I guess this is supposed to be satisfying??? It was super overdone and cringe-worthy. (At least he didn't show up to act like a bitch again.) Ayase has a pretty funny backstory, but it taught me a valuable life lesson: If you want someone's house, beat the shit out of them in order to obtain it. Apparently that's a thing in this place. She demonstrates how serious she is about restoring her father's dojo by getting dripping wet when Icky tries to help her. What a warrior! The only normal character I could actually enjoy was the Director lady, whatever her name is. She's kind of serious but troll-ish, like she's aware that she's in a bad anime but has accepted her fate.\\n\\n\r\nIf I forgot anyone worth mentioning, please notify me via junk mail, because it's probably a garbage character anyway.\\n\\n\r\nSo, was there anything I actually enjoyed beyond a superficial level? Yeah, turns out Cavalry doesn't want me to rate this a 1/10. The art is quite nice with some pretty standout moments.  For one, I enjoyed the opening's style, which is one thing that drew me to this anime. That style returns in the last two episodes and is executed very well. Icky's prison scenes looked appropriately desolate and grim while the cour's final fight had an iconic feel to it. This style amplifies in the dramatic penultimate episode and plays out like Shaft made a guest appearance, though it was probably my general lack of interest that kept me from really enjoying it. There are some really shitty-looking rock monsters late in the anime, though. But overall it's pretty good, so at least you'll get some good action, though little of it was memorable beyond the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is another story. I'll tell you that it has a pretty good OP and a pretty good ED, but the rest of the soundtrack has completely escaped me. I can't remember anything about it, so that tells you how good it isn't. Being unmemorable is better than being memorably bad, though.\\n\\n\r\nThat's about it. Congrats, Cavalry, I hoped to watch something that would just help pass the time and not piss me off very much and instead you instead made me regret not getting hit by a car instead. I'm probably considering this to be the worst anime of the year as far as I know, because at least Danmachi and Asterisk didn't make me uncomfortable with any stupid incest. Painful fanservice, generic concept/setting, laughable characters, it's not something I'd recommend to someone, even if it were to purposefully tease them.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the above text more-or-less applies to The Asterisk War, minus the actually good parts.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 2/10\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nSound - 4/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 1/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1/10\\n\r\nOverall - 3/10\\n\r\nFavorite character - Can't remember her name, don't care enough to look it up.\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 11\\n\r\nRecommended to anyone that liked The Asterisk War because it's literally the same thing.\\n\\n\r\nEDITED ON 3.14.16: I changed the score to a 3/10 because I feel that a 2/10 is only bare-minimum; Cavalry has some legitimate strong points and doesn't deserve that rating.",

            "content": "This anime is a weird one for me. I mean on paper, it is not all that. It has generic story and generic characters.  Nothing is new! There is also another similar anime that was airing at the same time, Gakusen Toshi Asterisk. Now, Gakusen is... umm to put it straight... bland. But I really can't pinpoint why Rakudai Kishi is at least twice as good than Asterisk. \r\nMy enjoyment level was so high that even I was surprised. If One Punch Man wasn't airing this season, I really would put this anime as my number one in pure enjoyment, not story wise, charactersor animation/sound but just in terms of enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is really not that difficult to grasp. You can sit back without having to think too much and get the general idea of where it is headed. The love story is also the same. You have a generic tsundere princess but she is so much more likable than the norm. She is tsundere done right! Our male protagonist is also the same old. He has personality traits that I probably have seen at least 50 times in male leads but again, he is so much more likable than the norm! Besides, he is one cool son of a... yeah. And for once, he isn't indecisive and settles with one girl even though it can be seen as a harem series which is a breathe of fresh air. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation was something that was impressive for an anime of this level. I mean with their budget, I think the studio did a damn good job especially at those action scenes. They added few interesting animation tones here and there that I haven't really seen other anime do. It just feels like the creators actually enjoyed creating this and put in extra efforts to make it awesome. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I am still confused to why I enjoyed it this much. But whatever, with what it had going for itself, it did a damn good job. And I sincerely hope it gets a season two. \\n\\n\r\nPS. ITTO SHURA! is probably one of the coolest moves I have seen in a while.",

It's nice to see a functioning relationship in anime for once between the leads.\r\nThe female lead Stella also seems like a rational human being, rather than the quirk-filled characters we usually get. She is the princess of a country and thus carries some regal bearing but surprisingly is not stuck up nor a pushover. IT's anice change of pace it allows her to able to support Ikki the male lead with all the shit his family throws his way. \\n\\n\r\nThe male lead Ikki comes from some prestigious samurai family, but due to the fact Ikki has got no magical talent ( yes in this anime they are not just knights, they are magical knights) they have basically disowned him.\\n\\n\r\n Later on, in the series, you get to see his father disparaging him too. It's mostly due to the patriarch of his family who gave him some encouragement once that has kept him going to when the story starts. Seeing him weather this throughout the show is pretty rough but like I said the support Stella gives him to soldier on is touching at times.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you are looking for something fresh as far as anime romances go with a few cool action sequences give this one a try.",

Three episodes in and you are already losing interest at what\u2019s unfolding in front of you but hang in there! Just like our MC here, this show follows suit by working its way up from its cliched fest of tropes set at the beginning! It brings nothing new to the table, but it succeeds in executing the same old concept very well. (More than you would expect!) TheAction scenes had real build-ups, clearly defining the reasons for all characters wanting to win their battles to reach the final tournament, thus making the fights feel more personal. The powers displayed aren\u2019t ground-breaking by any level but the way they were performed brought a lot of excitement to them. The love story also took me by surprise which is a rarity in such anime\u2019s, so it was enjoyably refreshing. The Romance may have started on a corny note, but it gets well-developed by launching it on a slow pace. The characters don\u2019t just fall in love with each other, rather they are confused by their own feelings and convincingly approach their confession of desires to each other on a more natural note. So, towards the end, I genuinely bought their relationship as I had witnessed an authentic chemistry between them which is worth rooting for!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters introduced look generic, but the anime lets their personalities to shine in order to stand out. The MC has a noble and hardworking attitude mixed in with a kind and tolerable demeanour that splits the fans on whether liking him or not! (I frustratingly found him \u2018Too Nice\u2019 at certain points!) He\u2019s disclaimed by his family and nicknamed as \u2018The Worst One\u2019 for his lack in magic skills yet it\u2019s his perseverance and desire to fight back that makes him very interesting. Despite showcasing tremendous set of skills like \u2018Perfect Vision\u2019 or his fight style, he is portrayed as an underdog in a believable fashion. (His powers are cool but limited!) What makes him a unique character is the situation he is put in and especially how he faces it! He strives when the odds are stacked against him, he enjoys turning unfair circumstances to his advantages, he revels in such environment because he believes it makes him stronger and this is the reason why he grabs people\u2019s attention so quickly. (Whether it\u2019s in a good way or a bad way!) Stella is our tsundere princess with a fire wielding sword who doesn\u2019t get a lot of screen time but manages to leave an impression by developing into a motivating character due to her romance angle. And while Shizuki is very badass with water manipulation powers, her self-devotion to Ikki and brotherly love was a total No No! She did start to change at the end by learning to act more like a sister than a lover with the help of her Not So Straight friend, Alice.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is noticeable and colourful enough to give a clean look but the real stand out is the work done on the backgrounds. Different shading and colours were given to specific situations, further establishing the distinctive temperament of the show, whether it\u2019s the warmth glow you get during flashes of Romance or the bleak monochromic setting with shades of red and blue to further symbolize the show\u2019s dark and depressing moments, they perfectly nail the atmosphere of the story. The same kind of care is seen with its animation as well since you watch the fights in clear cut angles and smooth fluidlike motions, sporadically dabbing with cool slow-mo shots which are pleasantly detailed and gorgeous to watch! THE OP is very bad, not in terms of its music or even the video attached to it, rather it\u2019s their choice of the singer who completely ruins it! However, the soundtrack plays as a great companion piece for the show since its pleasing to hear and helps elevate the scenes accordingly. The OST is a great harmonic mix of Jazz, Rock, Piano, etc. that can be listened to as a standalone piece due to its soothing, diverse and upbeat nature. (\u201cTension Feeling\u2019\u2019 happens to be my favourite one!) Regarding Voice Acting, the dubs were fine while the subs had more feel to it, but both are serviceable.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m glad to stick with this show since it does its job by impressing me even though it brought nothing new to the genre, still to my surprise it didn\u2019t follow the projected route I was thinking it was going to take! Though attaching Ecchi to some serious scenes actually hurts the show as it cheapens whatever they were trying to accomplish, but I did enjoy the few clich\u00e9 breakers here and there. However, in the end the anime manages to charm you with its firm handle on Action and Romance, thoroughly entertaining me with brilliant fights and making me care and root for the lovebirds! I would have liked to see Stella fight more and I wish the final arc had been stretched a bit more. In addition, this anime neither needs to be a Harem or an Ecchi so I hope to see less of it in the next season. It\u2019s definitely worth a onetime watch at least.",

It\u2019s your decision if you want to truly want to commit to reading whole my review or just get the highlights. Either is fine.\\n\\n\r\nNow my reviews aren\u2019t going to be how you normally find reviews on MAL. I don\u2019t score everything individually, my review talks about everything in unison with no specific structure and I sure as hell will not being doing a recap of the synopsis. The synopsis is right there at the top of the page, you don\u2019t need me to regurgitate that for you (ha!). Now since you know what to expect, please, consider giving my review a chance! If I convince at least one person to check out this show because of my review, I\u2019ll consider it a success. \\n\\n\r\n--------\\n\\n\r\nThe Actual Review: Chivalry is special title for me this season. Looking at the surface, it has everything that western anime fans usually despise nowdays: a high school battle school setting, a redheaded tsundere, an underrated MC that\u2019s actually really strong, and what looks like a stereotypical harem in the making. However, Chivalry uses all these tired and true tropes in such a way that is not only refreshing, but also bold. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with our main heroine, Stella. Stella has got to be one of the best tsunderes to come out of a battle harem show in some time, actually I\u2019d go as far to say, probably one of the best tsunderes out there. Definitely not as deep as tsunderes like Rin Tohaska (my personal favorite) and Asuka Soryu, but she is developed nonetheless. More so, it\u2019s her personality that really draws you in. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a tsundere that has balanced tsun and dere so well (Lucia from Rewrite would be a good contender however). Stella has a lot more dere than tsun and it will make your inner self squeal like a little girl at least more than once from the cuteness. Stella really grows a lot from the first episode and it\u2019s great to see. Our stuck up, hotheaded princess learns to care for other people and opens her heart to our hero. Stella is never a helpless damsel, but an equal, and is treated with respect. She can stand on her own two feet and does not walk behind our MC, but with him, shoulder to shoulder.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto our hero, Ikki. Ikki is not your average battle harem MC with \u201cundeniable\u201d morals who is cowardly to anything sexual and is annoyingly over-powered and is even modest to his strength acting like he\u2019s some weakling when he\u2019s the strongest there is. No, Ikki takes those horrid tropes and turns them into something that makes sense and maybe even relatable to some. Ikki is a true gentlemen: very honorable, respectful, and kind. In a way, he\u2019s almost like a traditional samurai or knight. Though, in many ways he is still an average guy with the same urges any male would have and that\u2019s what makes him stand out in a good way. Now let\u2019s just get the elephant out of the room here, Ikki handles fanservice moments very well and has some good reactions to them that shouldn\u2019t make you roll your eyes like so many other animes do. It boggled my mind that he was just so normal in his thinking and actions, and that he is also very upfront about his feelings. He is very genuine and true, he never once felt out of character, even in the fanservice moments. Ikki is also not the perfect gem that is just too good to be true. He is someone that is both extraordinary and ordinary, making a good balance without one overcoming the other. In terms of his power, well, I won\u2019t go too deep into that but Ikki works hard for his victories. You learn plenty about his training and what he had to go through, and seeing him fight just makes you want to root him on. He is confident in his strength, but is aware of others\u2019 strength. He doesn\u2019t underestimate his opponents, but he also doesn\u2019t underestimate himself. He is determined and treats each fight with care. Ikki\u2019s goals are a bit complicated and what he\u2019s fighting for is something most people can get on board with. Instead of a MC that seems to be portrayed as some weakling and yet seems to win his battles with added cheap suspense, when we all know he\u2019s going to win, we are instead given a MC that we know is strong despite his title and has to give it his all each battle to win. Each win feels completely fair and deserved, I never once thought Ikki won because of a cheap plot device. Ikki earns his wins and he earns his respect. As I said before, Ikki is not a perfect butterfly and has a few demons of his own that get looked upon in an excellent way. Ikki has great development throughout, just as his female counterpart does, and it\u2019s a great to watch it unfold. \\n\\n\r\nNow onto the actual romantic relationship. Ikki and Stella are my favorite couple of the year without a doubt. It\u2019s so rare to see such a normally depicted teenage relationship in any anime these days that you tend to treasure the animes that do get it right every now and then; Chivalry is definitely one of those rare few. Despite Ikki and Stella having such different backgrounds and personalities, they complement in each other in so many different ways and find the best out of each other. I don\u2019t want to give away too much, but this is a romantic relationship that goes places. It doesn\u2019t have a kiss at the end of the series, and it doesn\u2019t have a kiss and then suddenly all development beforehand is disregarded. No, this show goes far beyond the first kiss and develops the relationship in such a manner that is both realistic and respectable. I\u2019m the type of guy that almost demands sexual contact in a relationship and it drives me nuts when I see so many relationships in animes disregard it completely. Ikki and Stella develop as a couple and the two of them learn from each other how exactly to convey their love. They\u2019re teens that are interested in all the sexual things that every young couple are interested in and worry about the same things young couples would worry about. The fact that they are able to open up to each other and discuss matters that wouldn\u2019t as far as be alluded in other animes is a triumph, considering how rarely it happens. I couldn\u2019t believe how many things the relationship did right, I feel like someone was going to pop up on screen and be like, \u201cNah, we\u2019re fucking with you! It\u2019s all fake!\u201d  No, this show, despite having harem aspects, focuses on one couple and that said couple actually becomes a couple and acts like a couple (I know, weird isn\u2019t it?). It is so simple, but yet so compelling. I can only hope to dear god that more battle harems in the future follow Chivalry\u2019s lead because at the end of the day, most of us just want to see a solid romance without the endless gimmicks.\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice I believe is also used quite well. Fanservice isn\u2019t a sensitive topic for me like it is for so many others it seems. I usually enjoy it, but because I tend to like it, I can also tell the quality of fanservice as well. Yes, there is different qualities of fanservice: good fanservice, semi-good fanservice, average fanservice, bad fanservice, etc. Some people don\u2019t want to believe this and just think all fanservice is bad, but that\u2019s not the case! Anyways, there was some good sexy moments and they never felt overdone, it felt just right and I believe it fit the context of the moment/scene. The character reactions also makes it a lot more bearable. You should like it and find it assuming, there is especially one scene a little later in the series that was just such a damn good and sexy. It\u2019s hard to explain it without actually saying it, but when you get there, YOU\u2019LL KNOW. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the other characters go, I\u2019ll try to be brief as to not completely ruin it for you. They are all very good characters that you\u2019ll care about. Alice is great secondary male, and the other three girls that get major focus all have their different motives and are interesting. They all have their quirks and are quite entertaining. I liked them all very much and thought they were nice additions to the cast. Shizuku cock blocks every now and then, but even those moments can fairly funny. For the most part, I think you\u2019ll enjoy these characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe villains can be quite despicable. I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re cardboard cutouts that we\u2019re used to in so many other harem shows, but they are quite nasty. But some of them actually get development and we see another side to them that will make you think twice about their characters. This show has decent villains, not phenomenal, but definitely above average I\u2019d say. You\u2019ll hate many of them, but you won\u2019t hate them so much because they\u2019re annoyingly evil but because some of them are just true scumbags. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, honestly, it\u2019s pretty straight forward. There\u2019s definitely some family conflicts on the side, but the story is very focused on its one setting and that may be for the best. This is character driven show, the story is gives it direction and that\u2019s all it needs to do at the moment.\\n\r\nThe art and animation are amazing. They\u2019re so crisp and fluid, Sliver Link didn\u2019t hold back on this one. It\u2019s clear which anime got the better budget this season between the two Silver Link shows (sorry 35th Platoon!). The fight scenes are especially well crafted with such intensity in the animation. Legit, this show had some of the best fights I\u2019ve seen all year. The choreography is fantastic and the animation never falls behind. The character designs are also very high quality and I think they look great. \\n\\n\r\nAll and all, Chivalry is a great show and a fresh installment in a genre that is extremely stagnate. It\u2019s so rare do we get such likable main characters in a show such as this and it\u2019s even rarer that said characters actually progress into a developed romantic relationship. Some of you may think I\u2019m giving this show too much credit, but I believe this show deserves my admiration. It didn\u2019t blow minds with being incredibly unique in its setting, story, or characters. Rather, it excelled in its familiar, yet very different approach. Showing us that this genre still has some potential hidden deep inside if writers truly wished to look for it. Chivalry simply takes the tropes we know and loath, and uses them in a way that is both recognizable and new. It doesn\u2019t strive for the extraordinary, but rather using the ordinary in a better way. That my friends, I believe is worth praising. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 (Excellent)\\n",

            "content": "By far the underdog of this season, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry exceeded my expectations. The weak and generic start can put off a lot of people. Where as many will simply discard it as another addition to the list of ever growing bad harem anime. \r\nBut that will be a grave mistake, because amongst the bad shows the good ones get disregarded.\r\nSuch is the case with Rakudai Kishi.\r\nStory wise, it does not do much different, a school setting where students are called Blazers and they battle in selection matches to be selected in the Nationals. Nothing new here, the change arrives with the introduction ofour main leads.\\n\r\nStella Vermellion, an A class top of the class Knight and Ikki Kurogane, a failed F rank knight.\\n\r\nThe character personalities is a common share, what keeps them fresh is the interaction between them. \\n\r\nThe main is not some dumb, dense, perverted idiot, but a super strong, knight who can take on any opponent. Throughout the show, the characters evolve and change with clear personality development. \\n\r\nThe harem tag is immediately dropped as the two main develops a relationship in the fourth episode further solidifying it in the last.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot twist and the epic battle scenes make it a must watch show. It is a product of great battle scenes, breath taking moments and situations where you start rooting for the main as if you are in there. \\n\\n\r\nNo words about the sound, its very well done.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry came out to be a show that despite a weak start with generic setting and characters, picks up the pace and continues to evolve till the end.\\n\r\nIt could have been better and more well received, if it was not for the drag the first 3 episodes were. \\n\\n\r\n8/10 - Recommended",

            "content": "Here's my review of Rakudai Kishi no Calvary. I tried my best to make it short, had to actually cut a lot of stuff out (it's still kind of long) but I didn't want to drag it out. \r\nStory {8}:\r\nThe concept of Rakudai Kishi no Calvary is not unique. We've seen it a thousand times before actually. It's a magical school series where students fight against each other in an elimination round style to prove that they're the best in the school. Main Character, who always has a crowd of girls around him for some reason, is labeled one of the worst fighters but isactually one of the best, etc. etc. Just the usual. But something that separates Rakudai from every other series is the actual content in the story; the execution of it. Hidden underneath the introduction of the series is a fantastic anime that makes it more than the typical shounen. \\n\\n\r\nArt {8}: \\n\\n\r\nThe art is a little unique. It doesn't look like your typical anime art, though that doesn't mean it isn't good. The character design is average; the backgrounds are beautiful, and the way it's overall drawn is pretty nice. The art rarely ever falters as well. And in the last six episodes especially, the colors play a unique feat. \\n\\n\r\nSound {8}: \\n\\n\r\nThe music and overall soundtrack of Rakudai is pretty good. The opening is very catchy and won't leave you disappointed. I can't say the same for the ending (the ending sounds like something in a horror anime tbh. It reminds me of Another's opening) but it isn't too bad either. \\n\\n\r\nWhile we're discussing about sound, I should add in that most of the character's voice actors/seiyuus voices really fit their characters. You know those characters who look super badass and mature but their voice is super squeaky like a loli or a child? That doesn't happen in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter {8}:\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are pretty good. Their personalities aren't original or anything and there's definitely a lot of recycled tropes and cliches, but the characters are still enjoyable and nice. \\n\\n\r\nBoth the male and female lead, Ikki Kurogane and Stella Vermilion, are both nice characters. They both trained very hard to get to where they are today, and neither of them are dense. They might be annoying in the beginning, but both of them get character development over the series, making them lovable characters. \\n\\n\r\nThere's some other characters as well, like Ikki's sister, Shizuku, who can be very, very annoying in the beginning of the series but becomes an enjoyable one, and Ikki's friend, Alice, is mostly there to give him support throughout the show. There's also a whole bunch of other side characters too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment {9}:\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. It was quite the pleasure watching of. I loved a lot of things about it; the amazing choreographed fight scenes, the lovely soundtrack, the fact that it's NOT a harem, the extremely cute romance in it, etc. I don't have too much to say as to why I liked this anime, but I just know that I was anticipating for the next episode every week as it aired. In my eyes, it was a totally enjoyable anime and I honestly hope that it gets a season 2. \\n\\n\r\nOverall {8}:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd give it an 8. Personally, I rated this as a 9 on my anime list (since I rate mostly on enjoyment) but if I added in all the other factors such as story, art, etc. then it'd become an 8. \\n\\n\r\nRakudai Kishi no Calvary is a fantastic series, and though it's concept is pretty cliche and overused, the execution of the show is amazing.",

            "content": "Sometimes there is one aspect to a show that can save it from pure mediocrity. It may not try to propel it into the status of \"classic\" or \"greatness\", as there are still other aspects to it that are either okay or bad, but it can still garner it some admiration for trying. Rakudai Kishi no Calvary has the distinction of being one of these shows. As much as my expectations were shrouded in apathy when I started, by the time I was halfway through Rakudai, that apathy dissipated from just one aspect of it that kept me coming back.\r\nThe aspect I'm talking about inRakudai is how the show managed to form what could have been a generic romantic comedy plot and woven it into something that is quite unique, both in tone and writing. The plot involves our two main heroes, Ikki and Stella, that slowly develop a bond at the beginning of the show after they are forced to share a room together at a knight academy. Strangely enough it starts out like your generic romance where the girl acts tsundere towards the male lead, with your standard cliches involving humorous ecchi moments. At that point it's just okay, but then around the middle point of the show it starts to morph into something very remarkable to say the least. We see our couple start to actually act like a real couple would act once they confessed their love towards one another where they would argue constantly and share their feelings through physical or verbal needs. It was a breath of fresh air to see something that I hadn't seen in quite some time. To see an anime couple that actually felt like a couple with an intense love for another. An adorable couple that could be the best anime couple in the past year or so.\\n\\n\r\nToo bad everything else about the plot couldn't quite follow up on how great the relationship building was for Ikki and Stella. It isn't just because it is something we have seen before, the \"set in an academy holding a fighting competition that our protagonist participates,\" but also the fact that everything just feels so superficial and bland from how it is structured. It's almost as if the writers didn't know what to do to make this scenario anymore interesting, so they just tried to create these subplots involving other characters that felt one-note and not thought out well enough. Every time there was an match going on between two characters, all I felt was complete apathy from the whole experience by how badly they built up the plot for me to feel any tension on what the outcome would be. Does not help the fact that the action sequences are not anything to write at home about; not anything terrible or bad, just average to my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the action is not groundbreaking, that has nothing to do with the quality of the art and animation. I have to admit that the character designs are nice and colorful to look at. From the beautiful red hair of Stella that gives a devilish/cuteness aura around her that matches her personality to the supple bodies of all the girls, the art design makes a ton of effort to create a nice distinct look for Rakudai. Even though the animation is not always on point, it is good enough to warrant a passing mark to create a decent framework for the action sequences, despite my under-enthused mood towards them.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, Ikki and Stella are the hallmark of Rakudai and made me keep coming back to the show every week. The other characters, however, don't necessarily have a similar response from me. Most of them ranging on the mediocre to forgettable spectrum of quality characters. Shizuku is one such example that felt like was tossed on the wayside through the majority of the show in favor of Stella. While that does make sense since Stella is the main girl, they still touted Shizuku up as a love rival but they don't really follow up on her much once Stella became Ikki's girl. Again, might seem logical in that respect, however they still attempt to give Shizuku a much needed climatic moment near the end, but by the time I get to that point I completely forgot what the point of her character was. So I was quick to show no interest in anything she did up until the end, just like the rest of the other cast.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an ecchi anime as well, so for those that are still worried of Rakudai steeping closer to generic territory, don't be alarmed. While most of the ecchi fanservice involves our main heroine Stella, that is all the woman you need to tickle your ecchi bone fellas. I found it quite enjoyable to see a girl like Stella, a tsundere at heart, starting to open up, as she and Ikki start forming a romance, to him as a naughty girl. You often see girls like this in hentai saying something this straight forward, not even in the most raunchiest ecchi anime you could get your hands on do you often hear something as blunt as that. Besides the typical washing the protagonist back scenario, some of the ecchi moments come off as borderline heartwarming as they involve a romantic connection between the two main leads. It adds a new flavor to the ecchi mix that made me hoping for more in the coming episodes.\\n\\n\r\nDespite many of the issues I've had with Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, I still thought it was a decent anime to see, oddly enough. I guess you could chalk it up as the relationship plot arc as being so highly regarded by me that the flaws of it aren't terribly huge as it would have been if the Stella and Ikki relationship arc was not as strong. At its worst, it is mediocre. At its best, its good. Its an above-average middle of the road show that will enlighten some and detract others. For me, I just want more girls like Stella-chan to exist in the anime spectrum. Please?\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B-\\n",

            "content": "Rikudai Kishi no Cavalry A.K.A Chivalry of a Failed Knight is a perfect example of the expression \"don't judge a book by it's cover\". Under it's, as many would say, generic light novel anime adaptation look lies one of the most enjoyable and well made fantasy action romance shows I have had the pleasure to watch.\r\nStory: Very Good (8.0/10)\r\nLike most anime series the narrative is told in a continuous fashion, that follows the main character, Ikki Kurogane's, journey from the bottom of his school's ranks to the very top of said ranks while meeting more of his peers that most of time end up becominghis rivals in his rise to the top. It is a pretty easy story to follow but that doesn't make it boring. On the contrary. The very well made cast of characters, fantastic romance*, great battles**, good pacing and few annoying cliches turn an otherwise simple story into a very interesting, engaging and satisfying one. \\n\\n\r\n*personally my favourite aspect of the series with one of the best romances I have seen. It is sweet, cute, and feels every natural and real and it also does something most anime don't do: it talks about the worried that come with dating someone. For example not knowing if it is ok to be lovey-dovey with your partner because of the fear of driving them away.\\n\\n\r\n**great blood-pumping battles with great fight choreography and great animation\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisuals: Very Good (8.0/10)\\n\r\nVisually the anime is pretty high quality all the way through. The animation is consistently fluid, detailed, expressive and clean especially in the fight scenes and the fantastic Opening cinematic which uses primarily red, white and black giving it a very distinct look that makes it stand out from most ops. The character designs are pretty distinct making it easy to tell them apart from each other and they also communicate the characters personalities pretty well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Very Good (8.0/10)\\n\r\nwho ever choose the the voice actors for each character definitely knew what he was doing. Every voice fits perfectly with it's character and every voice actor gives a great performance. The OST is good and fits the show and the OP song is simply great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Really Good (8.5/10)\\n\r\nProbably the best aspect of the show. In the beginning every character seems like your cliched character archetype for box ticking like the tsundere, the incestuous little sister, the gay guy etc. but as the show progresses it is shown just how well written these characters are with believeable backstories and motivation and very likeable and complex personalities which makes most of them really memorable.\\n\r\nThe villains were ok but not the most impressive ones nor the most interesting ones.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Really Good (8.5/10)\\n\r\nreally enjoyed this all the way through and would recommend to anyone how likes a good anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.2/10\\n\\n\r\nWritten on the 3rd of February, 2019",

            "content": "Keep in mind this review is my first review in a long time, so bear with me please. Anyway let's start my review of an anime that is completely underrated, and wrongly compared to another anime this season known as Gakusen Toshi Asterisk.\r\nStory(8)\r\nCavalry tends to come off as an anime that'll be your typical magical school, harem \"Romance\". But Cavalry breaks that mold, and creates a real romance. One that doesn't leave you upset by the end *cough* *cough* Asterisk *cough*. The story follows Kurogane Ikki(MC), as he struggles to prove to his family, who constantly attempted to sabotage him, that he can do anythingif he works hard at it. To prove himself, he competes in the school's tournament in hopes to represent his school in the seven stars sword art festival.\\n\\n\r\nArt/sound(8)\\n\r\nThis art is soo vibrant, the colors just blend so well. The character designs are ok, the animation did take a dip in quality but by the end of the series i didn't even care. I don't pay a lot of attention to sound but i'm in love with the opening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8)\\n\r\nKurogane Ikki- Known as the \"worst one\" due to his magical power being so low. He is considered a failure by his family. But through hard work, he succeeds in showing how badass and OP he can be. He repeated his grade because of his family's influence ffs. This mc also earned my respect by actually picking a girl, i mean really, have you really ever seen that in your typical harem...\\n\r\nStella Vermillion- The heroine, the princess of another country, and Ikki's girlfriend. I also forgot to mention she's a badass on her own. People want to refer to her as the tsundere, but i think she's just extremely shy. By episode 3 she already realizes her feelings for Ikki, and even attempts to ask him on a date. \\n\r\nKurogane Shizuku- The only character i hate, really if you watch this you'll know why. Her only redeeming quality is how strong she is tbh. I really don't want to waste too much time or words on her...\\n\r\nNagi Arisuin or Alice- He or she is like the advisor for the small group. He or she gives off an older sibling type of vibe. It's somewhat pleasant to have a character like this as it keeps our characters grounded. Did i mention to say that he refers to himself as a woman so it can get confusing on how to address him or her. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9)\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are great, the characters are lovable in their own right. This series can be cute/nice one minute, and be epic or badass the next. It takes a lousy critic to judge an anime based off 1 episode, it takes a good one to look at the series as a whole. But it takes an anime fan to look at a series for its enjoyability. Rakudai has that factor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9)\\n\r\nThis i one of my favorites of 2015, definitely top 10. I wouldn't say this is a masterpiece, but it's surely something to check out. Btw for those of you who aren't fans of ecchi anime, try Asterisk, less ecchi scenes with more or less better fight scenes.",

            "content": "Greetings fellow Otakus! :3 I'm Marik and this will be my spoiler free review of the Fall 2015 anime: Rakudai Kishi No Cavalry, I'm going to split this review into Five sections: Story/Plot, Characters, Art Design/Animation, Music/Soundtrack and then my overall thoughts on this anime. Let's go ahead ;P *Disclaimer* This is my opinion on the anime and as such if you don't share the same thoughts as me on anything within the review feel free to let me know and we can discuss and share our opinions in a civilized fashion, also I'm open to any constructive criticism but please no negative comments oruncalled for hate and show respect to one another :3\\n\\n\r\n- Story/Plot: Rakudai Kishi No Cavalry or Chivalry of a Failed Knight is an anime set within a world where gifted humans can materialize their souls into weapons which are known as devices and each device has unique ability's that give these humans incredible power, these gifted humans are known as \"Blazers\" and they are the equivalent of modern day knights/magicians. These Blazers attend various schools around Japan to hone their skills and become strong knights, then they graduate from these schools and go on to protect Japan from any threat the world may impose as official Magical Knights/Blazers. In these schools there is a ranking system based on how talented of a Blazer you are and from lowest to highest it goes rank F, D, C, B then A. As you attend these schools every year there is an annual competition called The Seven Stars Festival in which Blazers from seven schools all over the country compete in intense one on one matches until one knight is deemed the most powerful Blazer in the country. (That's attending school) The story revolves around Ikki Kurogane, an F ranked Blazer who is widely known as \"The Worst One\" or \"The Failed Knight\" as he has no talent/aptitude for magical ability whatsoever, in fact he has a tenth of the average magical power of a regular person. He attends Blazer school in the hopes of proving to everyone around him that through hard work and determination and winning The Seven Stars Festival, even a \"Failure\" like him can become a knight as powerful as any other. At the start of a new year at school Ikki encounters a half naked foreign princess called Stella Vermillion who is changing in his room and this fateful encounter will change his life forever. :3\\n\\n\r\nMy thoughts on the Story/Plot: Overall the plot to this anime is good, it's not to complicated as to where you struggle to understand/keep up with it but it's not to vague as to where your wondering what the anime is about in the first place. It has a clear setting and a clear direction as to where it wants to go and the main character has a clear goal that he wants to achieve. The genres of this anime include: Action, Ecchi, Fantasy, Romance and School. Also the plot is never \"Tossed aside\" and replaced with fan service so if your worried about that happening you can relax and cast your fears aside ahah :3\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As the story progresses a huge cast of diverse characters are introduced/added into the mix.\\n\r\nIkki Kurogane: Ikki is the main character and is voice acted by Ryota Osaka. Other notable characters he has voice acted include Vali Lucifer from Highschool DxD, Staz Charlie from Blood Lad and many others. Ikki is from The Noble Clan: The Kurogane clan, which had produced generations of extremely talented magical knights, however when he was a child he was very ill treated and ignored by his family because he had no talent for being a Blazer, which was a fundamental requirement in a family such as the Kuroganes. When he was a small child he had had enough of his mistreatment and as a result ran away from home during a blizzard, as he was walking through the snow he came to the logical conclusion that he was going to die being a waste of life, however miraculously he was found by his grandfather, who is known as the most powerful magical knight in history, his Grandfather then saw his situation and took him in, saving him from certain death, and then Ikki grew up living with his Grandfather. However his Grandfather could not train him personally as he was to old and rugged, however he gave Ikki all of his wisdom and kindness and as a result Ikki developed a strong will and resolve and trained by himself tirelessly everyday of his life, honing his skills in swordsmanship and the way of the Samurai, while he had no aptitude for magical ability, his physical ability was superhuman, conditioning his body with intense exercise and training for years on end, this became his greatest strength as a magical knight and is shown throughout the series as the source of his backbone. Ikki's personality is very interesting, he is kind and disciplined to a fault, never resorting to violence and never shows any feelings of hatred or contempt towards others (Unless they deserve it), he is hardworking and has amazing resolve and determination in anything he wants to achieve, he is also very decisive which is a much appreciated trait for a main character :D unlike some mc's ;P he is very inspiring, he inspires others in a way that no one else could, often showing to others that talent isn't everything, including a certain someone ;P he is also very compassionate and able to relate to others very well, and finally he is very likeable, another awesome trait for a main character to have. Overall he is the definition of a Samurai and is a very good main character, he is everything you'd want in a main character and offers a very unique perspective on things. His chemistry with Stella is very genuine and awesome to watch and gets better and better as they become roommates very early on in the series etc. :3\\n\\n\r\nStella Vermillion: Stella is the main heroine of the show and is voice acted by Shizuka Ishigami. Other notable characters she has voice acted includes: Ayame Kajou from Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai, Ellis Fahrengart from Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance and many more. Stella is from The Royal Vermillion Family, a family of royals of a small island nation, she is the daughter of the Emperor of this island nation and is a princess as a result. Since she was a little girl she has had amazing talent for being a Blazer and as such she had never lost a one on one match in her life, as well as being talented she also works extremely hard, honing her skills since she was this little girl. Although her mother told her she didn't have to become a Blazer if it meant going through all of this tough training and hardship. However she continues regardless, emphasizing that if her nation wanted to truly prosper and grow she had to become a strong Blazer and be a shining role model to her subjects.\\n\r\nI'll be frank and say that Stella's personality is that of a Tsundere's xD (If you don't know what a \"Tsundere\" is it is a Japanese term for a character development process that describes a person who is initially cold and even hostile towards another person before gradually showing their warm side over time.) Although she is a very likeable Tsundere, she is very kind and compassionate at heart and is very distinguished since she is a princess after all, however she is very arrogant and pompous at the start of the show but has amazing character development in which she grows and matures into an amazing young woman, she's quite childish and since she is a Tsundere but not in a bad way, she is very cheeky and as such is very cute as well :3 she is a very strong independent woman so she has a hatred for those who assume that her life is a walk in the park since she is so talented and a princess of a nation and as such is very misunderstood. Overall the best thing about her is her amazing chemistry with Ikki, as this anime is fundamentally a romance between these two very different yet similar people it's very genuinely enjoyable and an awesome experience seeing these two grow closer together and do cute romancy things together, which does happen! thankfully haha :3\\n\\n\r\nShizuku Kurogane: Shizuku Kurogane is Ikki's little sister and is introduced fairly early in the show and is voice acted by Nao Touyama. Other notable characters she has voice acted includes: Momo Kawanagare from Ai Tenchi Muyou!, Hikari Senami from Busou Chuugakusei: Basket Army, and many more. Shizuku is the daughter of The Noble Clan: The Kurogane Clan, which as I mentioned before had produced generations of extremely talented magical knights and Shizuku is no exception unlike Ikki, she is a very talented Blazer and is especially adept with magical ability, she is a treasured member of the family and as a result got all the attention she could desire and had a very affluent lifestyle growing up, she had no worries at all and overall was very happy, she had a very close connection to Ikki and loved him dearly, as she grew older she realized how badly her own family had been treating her older brother, especially her father who despised Ikki because he had no talent for being a magical knight, she then relinquished her place in the Kurogane Clan, ashamed of being apart of such a cruel and inhumane family. She then decided that when she met up with Ikki when she began attending his Blazer school she would give him the love of a sister, a mother and a girlfriend/wife etc, which he had never had growing up. I was a little nervous about the shows quality when I found this out as I was afraid that it would be a weird \"bro con\" relationship between them but thankfully although she does occasionally be quite intimate with him in terms of hugging etc, she doesn't have a love for him based on lust, she genuinely cares about him and his well being and as such is very protective of him and just wants him to be with someone that makes him happy. Her personality is very unique, she's kind and very open with her friends however she is at heart very shy and conservative, often shying away from social activities etc, she is very mature for her age but since she's still a teen she's also childish and has hilarious conversations with Stella as they passive aggressively fight each other when they disagree on something, her chemistry with Ikki is very believable and genuine and as such she is a very good supporting character in the cast of characters this show has. :3\\n\\n\r\nNagi Arisuin: Nagi Arisuin (Aka \"Alice\") is Shizuku's roommate in the show and is voice acted by Shintaro Asanuma. Other notable characters he has voice acted includes: Takumu Mayuzumi from Accel World, Crow Hogan from Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's and many more. Not a lot is explored about Alice in the show in terms of backstory etc, he is Shizuku's roommate and is a very interestingly quirky character in the series. He has a very unique personality and quickly becomes Shizuku's best friend and closest person she knows besides Ikki. He is a very flamboyant character, often wearing very eccentric outfits/clothing and likes to do a lot of things that would be deemed \"girly\" such as gossiping, going shopping at the mall etc. Even though he is biologically a male he considers himself to be a woman at heart and as such acts accordingly xD this is definitely not something I'm against as he provides a very distinct diversity within the cast of characters and offers a unique perspective on things that occur within the show, he is kind and caring, very cheeky/funny and always enjoys teasing the other characters on the show, he is also a very strong Blazer and is always there to support/give characters advice when they need it, in a sense he's like the mother figure of the group of characters, always making sure everyone's okay and offering help whenever he can. Overall I'd say he is another very good supporting character in the cast of characters this show has. :3\\n\\n\r\nThose were all of the \"main\" characters of the show, as there are many other side characters who get fleshed out and introduced, and there are two villains within the show that I won't spoil as this is a spoiler free review :3\\n\\n\r\nArt Design/Animation: The Art Design/Animation within this anime is very good and should be acknowledged, from the characters to the scenery, to the action/fight scenes, everything is crisp, colourful and overall full of life, and also very dark/bland when it needs to be, nothing seems out of place or can be seen as a questionable decision when it comes to the design/colours. It definitely sets the standard for 2015 anime and does not disappoint. :3\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Soundtrack: The Music/Soundtrack in this anime is awesome, from the opening, to the action scenes, to the dramatic/emotional scenes, to the comedic scenes, to the sentimental scenes, nothing is out of place, the music is definitely well thought out/made and the director definitely payed special attention to what music should be played when etc. :3\\n\\n\r\nMy Overall Thoughts: In conclusion this anime is definitely a cut above the rest in the Fall 2015 season, with great action, romance, comedy and drama, along with a few sexy moments ;P this is a must watch anime for any magic school/romance fan, or even action/ecchi fan, although more action than ecchi I'd say ahah. Positives for this anime include: Great characters, Great Art Design/Animation, Great Music/Soundtrack, a believable and genuine romance, it doesn't \"beat around the bush\" and gets to the point, has an easy to follow but not simplistic plot, a clear goal that the main character has and a great ending that definitely sets up a season two well. Negatives include: Sometimes the fights are over a bit to quickly/seemed a bit to easy for Ikki, only sometimes however, and one or two characters aren't really fleshed out as much as they could be. I'd rate this anime an 8 out of 10, thank you for reading my review (If anyone did xD) and this has been Marik and I'll see you in the next review :3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "WARNING: Some of the nature of what makes Chivalry a good show requires me to discuss some spoilers for Episode 4 of the anime. It won't wreck your enjoyment of the show, but you have been warned!\r\nChivalry was a show which I went into with rather average expectations: The 5-6 kind of light novel show that is enjoyable but forgettable. For some, that will be true. For me, however, I was pleasantly surprised with this show's willingness to innovate within its genre, its desire to go for ambitious animation even if it was beyond their means at times and I enjoy the fact that theywent for some pretty cool, flashy fights.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing to get out of the way is the comparisons between Asterisk Wars and Chivalry of a Failed Knight, as the surface connections are so easy that a blind man could see them through a snowstorm. I will try to get through those comparisons throughout the review, instead of dumping them all at the start, but I think the difference in score between my reviews of the two series tells a lot of what you need to know.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with we have Ikki Kurogane, our main character, who's visual design is somewhat bland, although I do appreciate the brown colors that he uses. Unlike most Light Novel cookie cutter protagonists, Ikki is a rather driven person who reminds one of a more traditional action protagonist. Known as the \"Worst One\" at school due to his extremely low magical talent and some plot I won't get into, but nonetheless Ikki trains hard to become a strong \"Magical Knight\" in spite of basically everyone shitting on him and his lower end magical prowess. He doesn't go for the \"too cool for this show\" vibe or \"I don't give a shit and things happen to me\" vibe, instead being a character with his own personal goals and desires who actually ends up fairly cool. Considering the need to be low magic for the plot to make sense, his power set is pretty good too.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the good things about this show is it doesn't go for full fanservice harem, but is instead a romance-action series, eschewing the desire to use hot girls in place of plot (although this show does have plenty of fanservice, I'll get to that more later). This can be most seen in Ikki and his eventual girlfriend, Stella Vermillion. Stella, in comparison to Ikki, has great natural magical talent and uses it fully to her advantage, but feels it overshadows the hard work she puts in to reach the level she has. Stella fits the Tsundere archetype, but has an important distinction I feel which some Tsunderes miss: That the \"Tsun\" part is not just acting standoffish and dickish for no discernable reason and that the character usually softens when actually getting to know them. Stella's character arc understands this well, as her Tsundereness becomes driven by a lack of proper social understanding, and when she actually gets together actively with Ikki, the method of her Tsundereness changes as she developes more. She also is presented as an equal to Ikki who frequently bests her fodder even better than him and has her own goals and motivations.\\n\\n\r\nThe way this romance handled impressed me, in that it is a developing story throughout the entire first season, that the show goes for the full on romance from Episode 4 on, and that becoming romantic doesn't automatically make them click perfectly. Instead, they have issues with their physicality, they misunderstand each other, and in general they act more like what you'd expect a couple of people in school in love to act like. Comparing the characters of Ikki and Stella to Ayato and Julis from Asterisk Wars shows how superior Chivalry is by comparison: Ayato and Julis, especially Julis, have vague at best reasons for want they wish to do, with Julis' Tsundereness often being illogical, and Ayato's personality being quite difficult to discern and coming off as generic. In fact, amusingly, Chivalry has a side character later with a similiar motivation to Julis, except it also adds actual backstory and depth to the reasoning and gives it more examination in about an episode than Julis gets in a season, making this side character come off as far more realistic and interesting than Julis ever does. Ikki and Stella have motivations which are delved into and do not have silly, pointless stop and go.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two main characters are Shizuku Kurogane and Alice. Shizuku is probably the most hit or miss character given both her archetype and her general character: She is Shizuku's blood sister and is madly in love with him, although fortunately this gets played more for the dramatic parts of Shizuku knowing she will be unable to get him rather than a constant harem. In fact, Shizuku's romantic love for her brother gets surprising examination throughout the series considering this will usually be played for comedy only if it is not the show's focus, and she has fairly well thought out motivation to her. She also gets one of the cooler fights in the series and utilizes her power set impressively. While she could be annoying at times, I overall liked her, although I am someone who generally wishes more not-blood-related siblings with romantic stuff were because it seems like a cop out otherwise, so take that for what it will.\\n\\n\r\nAlice is the main character with the least screen time to her, but was quite enjoyable, and given that I have read up some on the light novels I would be very interested in where she went in a sequel series. A pre-op male-to-female transexual, Alice has pretty cool powers over darkness which allow her to teleport, bind people's shadows, and generally has a lot of potential for future fights in the series. She serves as the primary grounded one of the group who helps them understand themselves and others better and questions their motivations, while not releasing much info on herself. The fact that she is treated as normal and not just a joke trans character is a pretty big plus, and she has a pretty stylish look as well that is pretty fun. \\n\\n\r\nThere are of course more characters in the show like the mini villains, but going into them too much would just be spoilers: This show does have some good variety from complete douchebags to friendly rivals, though, which gives it someone who will appeal to most people at the least.\\n\\n\r\nPlot-wise, Chivalry is nothing groundbreaking, but it paces itself well and the way it handles aspects like Ikki and Stella's romance is an actually refreshing change of pace compared to various other shows I have seen, working fairly differently within the light novel adaption-esque genre. It fits a solid amount of character developement into 12 episodes while giving us a little mini-arc to go along with the main plot and sets up some prospective later villains which seem appealing. The story is essentially that the combat school, a school for \"Blazers\" which are people who use powers and gain weapons derived from their soul, is holding a tournament in preparation for the big national tournament for Blazers to decide who will represent them. Ikki, who failed the previous year for reasons the show delves into, is in such dire straights that he must win the entire national tournament to graduate, and so is putting in all of his efforts into doing so. When he becomes roommates with the recently transferred Princess Stella Vermillion, the two get into a fight which quickly leads to them understanding each other a bit better, and then plot going from there. We even get some political intrigue later with the involvement of the Kurogane family.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is not a blow you away plot, but it is solidly good and enjoyable, and has room to become more as time goes on. It doesn't skimp on fights, giving us multiple 8+ minute fights and actual characters and interesting powersets behind them instead of just useless mooks. It definitely isn't super deep, like a Madoka or whatnot, but it isn't super shallow either. When compared to Asterisk Wars, a show where even saying it HAS a plot is dubious at best, Chivalry comes faaaar ahead, compare the middle season mini-arcs to each other or how Chivalry uses seeming filler to effect and you get the difference.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound-wise, the show is very hit or miss. The first three episodes in particular have some bad art that seems to come from Silver Link punching outside of their weight, although I applaud their attempt: The obvious one of these is the very start of the show, which starts with a pan through Ikki's room and to his TV, which will probably make you feel like you are playing some kind of Xbox free game based on Heavy Rain. There's also a pretty laughable shot of Stella's flaming \"aura\" in the first fight which is really, really bad animation that brings to mind bad 90s anime. The \"aura\" in Episode 2 are also pretty bad. But the show noticably improves in its art as it goes on, with the ocassional flub, and actually ends up doing some pretty impressive stuff as it goes on. I especially applaud some stylistic choices in the last two episodes which are fairly well done and give me a Persona 3/5 aesthetic feel to me, which is great appeal, the use of monochrome with striking visual colors giving it a trippy feeling that really matches the tone the show is going for right now. This, combined with what I actually thought was some fun fight  choreography (albeit not AMAZING) pushes the art to a 7 despite the flubs.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise is a similiar story: The early episodes seem to have some issue with properly volumizing the sound and end up ocassionally being too drowning, but it has some notable background beats which become better interwoven as time goes on, especially in stuff like Kuraudo's fight. The OP, \"Identity\", is a pretty nice song with some cool, surprisingly dark visuals which really show off the difference between it and Asterisk War's extremelt generic, poorly animated opening. Chivalry's ED IS rather forgettable, however.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if one is looking for a romance series with action or an action series with romance, Chivalry is perfectly acceptable and actually pretty good unless you are unwilling to sit through fanservice, as the first three episodes have quite a large amount of it compared to the rest. It does not innovate the genre and totally make you rethink how it works or anything, but within the context of a light novel action series it innovates for a story. It has good action which gives unique powers and personalities to its opponents and doesn't just do the entire tournament arc in a flashback or anything dumb. It has solid motivations and growth for characters in a 12 episode series and some neat designs. For me, being a breath of fresh air, the striking visual presentation at points and some other personal appeal makes it get into an 8 star for me, and an average of about 7.5 feels right for the series. It is a good series with some obvious flaws, essentially, and some surprising elements. At only 12 episodes, I heartily recommend it at the least given the low time investment.",

            "content": "- I N T R O -\r\nI was looking for the next quick watch to help me relax from all of the great but tense anime I've been watching and I decided on Rakudai Kishi No Cavalry after seeing a few fun clips on YouTube. I wasn't left with a good taste in my mouth, not to say I didn't expect it... but it wasn't anywhere near to this extent, here's why :\r\n- S T O R Y -\r\nThere are humans capable of using magical power to manifest their souls as weapons and they are called Blazers, and those who are recognized as such undergotraining at academies to become Mage-Knights.\\n\r\nIkki Kurogane is an aspiring Mage-Knight, despite being considered the worst student at Hagun Academy as an F-ranked Blazer\u2014the lowest rank possible.\\n\\n\r\nOne morning, he accidentally stumbles upon Stella Vermillion, a visiting princess and A-ranked Blazer who has just enrolled at Hagun, in a state of undress. As a result, she challenges him to a duel where the loser will be the winner\u2019s slave. It seems like a surefire win for Stella, but could there be more to Ikki than meets the eye?\\n\\n\r\nOf course there is something more to him, he's the protagonist of a Light Novel adaptation.\\n\r\nThe premise is insultingly generic and the story itself is no different. All of the LN clich\u00e9s you could think of, it's like Rakudai hits them all on purpose.\\n\r\nThe pacing is too fast at moments and at some episodes it's non-existent.\\n\r\nThe writing feels extremely amateurish at more than a few points and the comedy is extremely forced.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle scenes are handled alright, though they're nothing great. Two of the battles are well choreographed and do flow nicely, but that's far too few. Every other battle relies on absolute non-sense or Ikki's ability which is to use 100% of his power in one go, since humans can never bring out 100% of their power.\\n\r\nThough this ability does not last long and serves as a victimization tool for the protagonist. The moment it's duration expires, Ikki collapses because he's tired to create the illusion he really struggled with the battle when he easily defeated his opponent with his plot convenient power.\\n\\n\r\n- C H A R A C T E R S -\\n\r\nNone of the characters are unique, Kurogane is nothing more than your typical bland self-insert present in plenty of Light Novels. He has no personality outside of constantly spewing his clich\u00e9d ideologies like ''Friends should never be hurt'',  ''the truly strong ones are the people who have someone to protect'', etc.\\n\r\nOther than him being a rather weak character, there's nothing much to say about him. His backstory is mildly interesting but it is nothing new.\\n\r\nThe main female lead, Stella, is a basic tsundere. They didn't go out of their way to flesh her out or make her a unique. She's just a waifu archetype and nothing more.\\n\r\nIn fact, every single female in this series is a waifu archetype, none of them are developed. They feel rather uninspired in terms of design.\\n\\n\r\nWhatever antagonists this anime has, he/she's nothing more than a one dimensional villain to make sure the MC looks cool infront of the girl. They don't really have much of a personality on their own.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also tried to shamelessly force in incest, yes, it doesn't miss out a single clich\u00e9d Light Novel trope.\\n\r\nHis sister is in love with him, she's nothing more than a shallow character serving only as a love rival to the main female lead. \\n\r\nAlongside her, we're introduced to another character, he happens to be male so of course in order to not get in the way of the harem he has ''a maiden's heart''. \\n\\n\r\nThe main selling point of Rakudai Kishi No Cavalry is the fact that unlike many anime of that sort, the main characters do get in a relationship, that doesn't stop  Kurogane from having his low-key ship moments with the other girls to tease the fans of course. Also, every single romantic interaction of theirs is extremely forced, the author felt the need to constantly remind the viewers/readers that the two MCs are in a relationship and that it's a big deal.\\n\\n\r\n- A R T  &   A N I M A T I O N -\\n\r\nThe art in Rakudai feels extremely bland and uninspired, you would have a hard time setting it apart from similar anime such as Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan or  many other. There is no set atmosphere in it, it's just a regular city with a messy setting. It seems more technologically advanced in certain places but other locations feel just like a regular city building. Despite all of this, it does fit with the series and still does feel pretty at places.\\n\\n\r\nArt aside, the animation is actually good during the action scenes, it flows nicely but as I mentioned before, the battles themselves are not well choreographed, they feel like a slugfest of random attacks, only the very first battle had some kind of strategy involved but even then the animation  still makes the action scenes enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n- S O U R C E    M A T E R I A L -\\n\r\nRakudai Kishi no Cavalry  by  Misora Riku (Story)  and Won (Art) - The art in the Light Novel is certainly better than it's animated adaptation but seeing as this is a Light Novel, it's not of much use as you're gonna see an illustration every 100 pages. The script, while it does have more time to develop itself and the events that happen, the characters are still nothing more than just archetypes and a bit more time to develop the story does not make a difference since the overall script is bad, amateurish and the pacing is still all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nI do recommend reading the Light Novel over watching the anime though. Unless you're just in for the pretty colors and animation.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nHolding the door open for others. Pulling the chair out for your date. Saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you.\u201d Common actions that you (hopefully) do for others. A code of conduct that the Medieval knights originally created.\r\nI am talking about chivalry. I am talking about chivalry because I am talking about Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry. (Yes, \u201ccavalry\u201d and not \u201cchivalry.\u201d)\r\nI try to be as courteous as possible to others, and I do not usually get bothered when others are not. Except for one example: holding doors. More specifically, when I am behind someone and he orshe walks through a door in front of me, and he or she does not look back to try and keep the door open, I get slightly irked. No doubt trivial, but I cannot help it.\\n\\n\r\nIn Cavalry, holding doors open for others is not a motif. Still, the anime keeps its own doors open for others to witness just how strong it happens to be.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nCavalry\u2019s tale is one that has been told many a time in the medium. Ikki, a \u201closer\u201d compared to his peers, is looking to prove himself in a high-school battle royal. Perhaps obviously, it turns out he is not a loser but actually the strongest dude ever. But rather than having himself a harem (the usual direction), the narrative takes a different route: he forms a romantic relationship with Stella, the (albeit stereotypical) tsundere, fire-based transfer student.\\n\\n\r\nThis romance is primarily what the events of Cavalry revolve around. Their initial duel. The arrival of Ikki\u2019s sister. The hostage situation. The start of the tournament. And the public pool trip. For approximately five episodes, the anime slowly builds up the romance into not just a believable connection but also a natural one.\\n\\n\r\nSimultaneously, the anime interlaces these episodes with other welcome additions. The introduction of characters, building the world (the system, the society, and so on), and various battles are included alongside the romance, giving the audience even more out of the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nAll the while, Cavalry has relevant sexual and comedic content. For example, Stella wanting to wash Ikki in the bathroom is sensual and funny, but it also serves as more romance. And Shizuku straddling Ikki and slowly inching her face towards his face is (again) not just sensual and funny but also demonstrative for how she generally acts and where her scenes proceed.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Cavalry dips slightly is in the middle set of episodes. The romance-driven narrative does continue. Ayase\u2019s arrival sparks jealousy in Stella, getting her worried that Ikki may be taken from her. The thigh-touching scene was a tad unnecessary, but the intimate moment Ikki and Stella share that night quells her \u201cinsecure\u201d feeling and makes her trust Ayase.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that these episodes are too much of an aside. Ayase receives attention and therefore development, but these events and even Ayase herself are barely referenced again and hardly impact the overarching plot. Hence, they come off as pointless despite the continued exploration of the romance.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Cavalry finishes as strong as it possibly could. Episode nine and ten serve two purposes. The first purpose is to (once again) continue the romance. The vacation gives Ikki and Stella time alone, but it is the sultry scene in the cabin that foreshadows what is to come. The second purpose is to get the final villain ready. Todo\u2019s power is proven twice over \u2013 taking out the rock golems and defeating Shizuku \u2013 setting up the stakes for the final battle.\\n\\n\r\nThe last two episodes, however, steal the show from itself in stunning fashion. The events of episode eleven happen the way they do because Ikki wants to prove how much \u201che cares about the relationship\u201d he has with Stella. (The anime\u2019s words courtesy of Shizuku.)\\n\\n\r\nBut more than this, the episode builds up so much tension. So much drama. So much emotion. The events may be laid on thick \u2013 Ikki\u2019s conversation with his father, literally being put in isolation for days on end \u2013 but they instill that sense of unfairness to the max. As a result, the audience is pumped and furious and ready.\\n\\n\r\nThis is all expertly executed. But the mastery occurs in episode twelve. Ikki battling through a figurative snowstorm, subsequently full-circle framing the narrative, is nice. Everyone arriving outside to support him one last time before the final fight is nice, too.\\n\\n\r\nBut these moments are not what do it; it is the final fight itself that does.\\n\\n\r\nThe audience expects this to be an amazing fight with swords flashing and bodies flying and techniques flurrying. But no. Instead, the entire fight is condensed into a single second. It cannot be said enough how absolutely satisfying that one second is. All of that tension and drama and emotion that had been built up for an episode and a half? How all the unfairness was stockpiled onto Ikki? Gone. In the span of a miniscule moment, Calvary brings euphoric relief.\\n\\n\r\nYet the show continues to deliver satisfaction. Ikki wins it all, the bad guy is wrecked by Stella, and the two announce their betrothal to each other (the aforementioned foreshadowing followed through), capping off the entire season on as high of a note as it possibly could. Thus, the ending ends up being one of the strongest in recent memory.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all of these episodes, what is it that Cavalry is trying to tell its audience? What story did it create? What messages did it try to impart?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer is in the narrative: love. Love motivates people. Love for a lover motivates that person to always be there for the other, to always do whatever he or she can for the other. But it is not just love between lovers. It may be love for a friend that motivates someone to reach out a hand. Or it may be love for a sibling that motivates someone to give it their all. Love is this weird and amazing and unique emotion that motivates people in ways they never thought possible.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, as Cavalry shows time and again, love can always be relied on.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nCalvary generally sticks to drab colors. This includes both its art and its character designs. The former is usually dark greens, whites, and blues, and the latter is usually browns, blacks, and purples. In tandem, they keep the anime grounded, realistic in its presentation.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking more on the art, the static setting unfortunately keeps the backgrounds boring to look at. This boringness is caused by the buildings, rooms, and recreational areas missing extensive details. As for the character designs, the only two that (literally) stand out are Stella\u2019s and Shizuku\u2019s. Stella\u2019s tsundere-symbolizing hair, sexy figure, and different outfits give her an edge over the others. Shizuku\u2019s icy-symbolizing hair, cute looks, and different outfits give her an edge over the others, too.\\n\\n\r\nLighting is similar to the coloring. Except for a few instances, like a sunset on the hill, a hot summer day, or the different battles, Cavalry keeps its lights low-key. This has the double effect of keeping the anime more serious and highlighting those moments when shining does make an appearance.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Cavalry shines brightest is with its cinematography and animation. Most of the time, the anime does not do anything too fancy. Up-close lips forming words, focus on the lewd, bouncing breasts, and shots of closing fans and floating petals are quite standard. The exception is episode eleven: The grainy effect and black-and-white depiction amplified the downcast feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle scenes, however, step it up and then some. While Ikki is in the vast majority of the battles, each one involves a vast array of abilities. As such, Calvary employs a myriad of different camera techniques and perspectives. One example is a top-down view of Ikki falling into a stream of bullets that changes into a view that follows him in a circular pattern. Another example is Todo using her \u201cRaikiri\u201d that simultaneously shatters the black bars used for the wide-screen view.\\n\\n\r\nBut, perhaps obviously, the best example is the final fight. The harsh wind, the lightning effects, the slow-motion; the intense expressions, the draining color, the bloodshot eyeball; the floating blood, the back-and-forth camera, and the minimally drawn \u201cextreme moment.\u201d The entire scene does not last long, but it is unquestionably captivating.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nArguably the worst character writing-wise is Stella. In the beginning, the anime reveals bits of her past. Within, the audience learns (albeit heavy-handedly) how she had only been looked as strong for her inherent talent. Nobody would take into consideration the hard work and dedication she put into training and getting better. Ikki is the first one to notice this, and his noticing is the catalyst for her romantic feelings towards him.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, beyond the first episode, her character is placed almost exclusively on the wayside. Most of the events have her in a secondary role: supporting Ikki, quarreling with Shizuku, and so on. Because of this, she very rarely directly affects the outcomes of the events and comes off as too passive despite her importance.\\n\\n\r\nCavalry instead uses Stella for sexual purposes. Indeed, some are admittedly obtuse. Her leaving the shower and losing her towel and her getting forced to remove her clothing in a mall sexualize her more than necessary. However, the majority of her sexual scenes are designed around her romance with Ikki. Straddling Ikki in bed, bathing him with her breasts, and asking him to sleep with her is sexual but purposeful since it highlights how deeply she cares for Ikki.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it is not out of character. The only other time where she receives heavy focus is episode five. This episode is all about Stella and her \u201cnaughty\u201d feelings. Obviously they are not naughty; they are natural. She did not know that, so she, with Ikki, comes to understand that what she felt and what she wanted is absolutely normal for someone in a romantic relationship.\\n\\n\r\nIkki comes to understand this too, but, contrary to Stella, he goes through a lot more \u2013 as he should, considering he is literally the main protagonist. Ikki\u2019s whole shtick is how much he is \u201cinferior.\u201d Because of this, his family disowned him and he had no friends to speak of. He is alone, and he is lonely.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being ostracized, Ikki did not let it get to him. Instead, he channels this inferiority of his to become the knight everyone said he could not be. He trained by himself. He honed his skills. And he bided his time. When Stella shows up, his life finally starts to improve. She becomes his girlfriend. Shizuku, his sister, arrives as well. And along the way, Ikki makes friends with countless other people while also demonstrating his latent potential.\\n\\n\r\nAt times, the writing surrounding his character can be a bit too obtuse \u2013 one too many long-winded explanations (telling over showing). And while he continually deals with conflict, his character rarely extends beyond being a super-nice dude, helping others with their problems.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, what Ikki represents, what he exemplifies is the notion of perseverance. The idea that, even when the odds are seemingly insurmountable, it is not worth giving up. He may get flustered before his fight with Kirihara. He may be forced to abandon his friendship with Ayase. And he may have been heartbroken after his talk with his father. Still, he persists, and the story explains how: the love he had from the people around him.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, while obviously not to the same level, channel this theme too. Stella perseveres to keep her promise with Ikki. Shizuku perseveres to support her brother. Ayase perseveres to uphold the tenets of her father. For all of them, including Ikki, there are highs and lows, wins and losses. And for all of them, what matters most is trying to persevere. Because then, and only then, can one become \u201cstrong.\u201d Strong of body, strong of mind, and strong of spirit \u2013 as Ikki may put it, persevering is the only way to \u201csharpen\u201d one\u2019s soul.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking more about side characters like Ayase and Shizuku, they have strengths of their own. Ayase gets a considerable amount of attention. She represents the lengths people will go to get what they want and how people should not be afraid to ask for help. Shizuku represents that, sometimes, there are limitations to what people can do and who people can be.\\n\\n\r\nThe best side character \u2013 and arguably the best character in the entire anime \u2013 is one that is not even designated as such. Alice, Shizuku\u2019s roommate, is a part of the main gang, but he never takes the spotlight from them. Instead, he, like his \u201cHermit of Darkness\u201d device alludes to, acts like a shadow: He is always around watching but not doing much.\\n\\n\r\nOnly until he needs to step in to provide words of wisdom. For Alice, his best trait is how he is the lens that the audience uses to view the characters in a new light. Be it words of encouragement or digging deeper into their thoughts, Alice always shows up to support his friends (most often Ikki and Shizuku) when they need it most, giving the audience a new glimpse of those he helps.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the antagonists, they tend to be one-offs. Bishou is the random bad guy that exists for less than half an episode. Kirihara is the comically cruel villain who bullied Ikki in the past. Kuraudo, the \u201cSword Eater,\u201d is Ikki\u2019s biggest rival. Mamoru is the tyrant who practically broke Ikki. And Todo is the kind yet formidable student council president.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Todo, the anime does not go into much depth with the antagonists. Surprisingly, having many antagonists works in the context of the show: Cavalry is a tournament-style anime, so constantly switching between foes only makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, given its length and its scope, Cavalry did more than all right with its cast.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track, the effects, and the original soundtrack are the best parts of the music within Cavalry.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the OP, the trumpets elevate that triumphant feeling, matching the same feeling that permeates the anime. The vocalist does not have a lot of range, but his way of singing \u2013 skipping and lingering with the lyrics \u2013 fits nicely alongside the dropping effects and quick beat. The English lyrics are admittedly silly \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s time to take a top\u201d \u2013 but the rest of the OP still manages to exude a strange brand of cool.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, playing the OP during the final fight against Todo was fantastic. Using it enhanced the scene beyond where it already reached.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the silly \u201cLet\u2019s Go Ahead\u201d announcement, the effects during the fights are also top-notch. Arrows shooting, swords colliding, and water flowing, plus a myriad of other effects, turn the battles into spectacles that the hears cannot help but listen to.\\n\\n\r\nAlso (and as if more needs to be said about it at this point), the final fight deserves extra credit: Ikki\u2019s blood vessel\u2019s pumping, his and Todo\u2019s auras radiating, and the wind building perfected the scene that much more.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the OST. The tracks mostly exist to ramp up the battles with lots of pianos, drums, and violins. The instruments are accompanied by resounding choirs as well halts in the music that increase adrenaline. Outside of the battles, Cavalry goes softer with more pianos, acoustic guitars, and bass guitars that contrast with the other tracks and keep the mood happy. And it even includes a piano, instrumental arrangement of the OP that is quite peaceful, rounding out the OST.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting performances for the anime are a toss-up that generally lean more positive than negative.\\n\\n\r\nOn the one hand, Shizuka Ishigami\u2019s voice for Stella was cute and, more importantly, sultry, seductive in its delivery. Nao Touyama as Shizuku gave the adorable sister a cute yet stern way of speaking. And Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Kirihara made his character into both the bully and the crybaby that he was.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Yuu Kobayashi\u2019s voice for Ayase ranges from shy to nice to evil to sad, but it does not fit the character all that well. Shintaro Asanuma as Alice uses an effeminate voice that fits, but he does not demonstrate range. And Ryota Osaka as Ikki does nothing special, but, given the character\u2019s self-insert status, it works.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, and arguably the biggest blemish on Cavalry, is the ending track. The ED comes off as an almost haunting composition that one would hear at a masquerade ball in olden times. This tone is weird because the anime\u2019s mood does not match whatsoever. The vocalist does what she can, but the mixture of instruments and the all-over-the-place lyrics do not mesh well together.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nHave I made it clear yet that I love that final fight?\\n\\n\r\nBecause I love that final fight. I watched it again a few times in order to analyze it here, and each time I was still impressed. Ikki and Todo simultaneously saying their internal monologue is yet another factor that makes the final fight nothing short of incredible.\\n\\n\r\nThe other fights were also awesome. My next favorite is Shizuku versus Todo because of the length and the cool (pun intended) and electric (pun intended) abilities. Ikki versus Kirihara was fun, too, just to watch that smug dude get what he deserved.\\n\\n\r\nThere was more to this anime than just the fights, though. Stella being so sexy and cute all of the time was more than welcome. And if you know me, then you know that the romantic developments made my heart skip more than a few beats. Stella\u2019s and Ikki\u2019s initial confession, their \u201cfight\u201d at the pool (this one was priceless), and their hand holding at night were each heartwarming and precious moments that made me stupidly giddy.\\n\\n\r\nI also found Shizuku to be a pretty fun character. Her cuteness around Alice made me smile. (They need to end up together; I am shipping them.) Her bold advances towards Ikki were eyebrow raising. And her banter with Stella \u2013 like in episode two where the music cuts away to make room for their insults and in episode six where Shizuku\u2019s comedic portrait pushes Stella\u2019s comedic portrait to the side of the screen \u2013 was hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nEven the other, lesser parts were entertaining. The running gag with Yuuri, the blood-barfing teacher. Nene, the short, carefree \u201cinstructor,\u201d always abandoning her commentary post and getting teased by Kurono, the Director. Ikki saying his two signature lines: \u201cWith my strongest\u2026\u201d and \u201cItto Shura!\u201d (His use of it in the final fight was just way too cool.)\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that I was entertained from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nRakudai Kishi no Cavalry may be another high-school-magical-tournament-ecchi anime, but it is more than that. The story is focused. The characters are purposeful. And the visuals, music, and entertainment have their own, respective strengths. Basically, chivalry or no, this anime definitely deserves to be treated courteously.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, a romantically-driven narrative that starts strong, dips slightly in the middle, and ends superbly\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, the artistic direction is interesting for the fights, with okay character designs and backgrounds\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, while Stella is too passive as a character, Ikki, Alice, and the others have clout, with everyone involved in the theme on perseverance\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, bad ED, nice effects, nice OST, generally above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, amazing romance, awesome action, and a lot of laughs\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "Rakudai kishi no Cavalry is an ongoing light novel series from Misora Riku. Near the end of last year an anime adaptation aired. It was handled by Nexus and Silver Link. Silver Link being the studio behind WataMote & Baka To Test. Yeah, that's not an auspicious sign. Then again, those are the only two series that they did the main work on that I've reviewed or even seen. Their studio probably has some really good stuff of their own. I know that some of the stuff they've done in-between animation for has been quite good. So, let's look at this thing and see ifthe third time will, indeed, be the charm.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nIkki is the worst magical knight. He's at the bottom of his class in ranking and can't even get proper lessons because his stats are so low. One day, he returns to his room to find a young lady changing her clothes. Not knowing what else to do, he apologises for seeing what he saw and takes off his clothes to make up for it. He later finds out that this is his new room mate. Princess Stella Vermillion, a high ranking magical knight exchange student. The two have a mock battle to decide who gets to make their room's rules. After the obvious upset, the two and the rest of their school begin competing in a tournament to determine who will represent them at some big magic knight battle event.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the comedy in this series for a moment. I know, it's an action fantasy romance and not a comedic work. However, it does try to inject quite a few comedic moments. The problem is that these comedic attempts are just poor. They all seem to be based on something being unusual. The perky teacher who constantly vomits blood or Stella's entire body turning bright red in a slightly over the top way. Misora doesn't seem to understand that unusual does not equate to funny. I could sew newsie caps onto the shoulders of my coat and it would be weird but it wouldn't really be funny and the same can be said for these moments. They're odd and, at times, out of place but they aren't funny.\\n\\n\r\nLet's move on to the main narrative. We have an underdog hero in a tournament with a bunch of other teens who all have special powers. It's a very trite, very done to death type of story. I've reviewed two series that used the same premise, at least as far as I can remember ff the top of my head, four if you count the tournament arcs in Dragonball and Yu Yu Hakusho and there are quite a few more out there. Rakudai kishi no Cavalry takes this very over-used, standard premise and does nothing unique or original with it. It follows every clich\u00e9 with no surprises which just serves to make it incredibly predictable and pretty boring when it comes right down to it.\\n\\n\r\nThat brings me to the biggest weakness of the series, the romance. Like the main narrative, the romance is very trite and standard in terms of its arc. However, it also suffers from there being no chemistry between the leads whatsoever. They barely know each other and have been nothing but antagonistic and then, suddenly she has a thing for him. All in the same episode. No explanation or motivation behind it. It's just contrived and weak. Then she starts acting tsundere towards him and then the obvious arc is obvious. Granted, it could be worse. His younger sister could be introduced as a romantic rival. Wait... she is. This romance is utter shite.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nSo, with such a standard plot do we at least get strong characters? After all, Nanoha Vivid managed to do something pretty good with the same story just by virtue of having strong characters. So, what do we get here? The bland protagonist who acts like basically every generic nice guy protagonist ever, I'm going to call him Blandon from this point on. The tsundere princess, I'm going to call her OA from this point on because it amuses me to do so. The creepily devoted little sister. The supportive trans-girl and a bunch of archetypical characters on the side. The closest you get to any character arcs are the standard doubting yourself for reasons and having to get out of it thing that Blandon undergoes near the end and OA's spontaneous romantic interest in Blandon. And even those character arcs are ones that are often associated with the tropes the characters embody. I will give the series some credit for not using the trans-girl for a bunch of really tasteless jokes, they do have one, when so many series would have but that's not saying much. Save that the series could have been tackier.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this is a bit mixed. On the positive side, there is some really nice background design The battle between the little sister & the student council President is pretty decent. The character designs also look mostly okay if a bit standard, except that their eyes are done in such a way that it looks like they're all constantly wearing heavy eye-liner. On the down side, this is a series with really tasteless, really tacky uses of fan-service. There's also an issue with most of the action sequences being really weak. So, not only do you have this bog-standard plot but there aren't even good action sequences to make it worthwhile. Instead, we get these very quick matches that end before anything exciting can happen or these kind of standard hero gets knocked around a bit before winning matches. The final match in the series is the absolute worst offender. They build it up quite a bit and then it's over in ten seconds. What's the point of a super-powered tournament plot if there aren't even going to be good fight scenes? Then, we have the \u201cartistic\u201d art choices. We've seen some of these in other reviews, the odd slanted shots in Phantom and such. Inn this one, they use mostly black and white with little colour during Blandon's doubting arc. To be fair, they do actually need to do this for practical reasons. There's nothing to the character beyond the trope so the art has to try and convey the emotional tone that the character himself can't carry.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe acting in this is not very good. It suffers from the same issue as a lot of anime with weak characters, the vocal cast is very limited in what they can actually do with them. You can't give a complex performance to Blandon or OA or any of these other characters because they have no complexity. Instead, we get the actors doing the standard performances that go with the tropes. They may not be strong, emotional performances but they're the best you can expect under the circumstances. The music is pretty forgettable. It's not Nakagawa Kotaro's best, certainly but it's not bad. Remember, he did work on the music for Code Geass.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't any in the series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nRakudai Kishi no Cavalry is a bad series. The plot is trite. The romance is outright atrocious. The characters are weak with acting to match. The action is mostly pretty bad, culminating in an unforgivably short and disappointing climactic battle. If you're looking for a series where super-powered characters battle one another, you'd be better off with Nanoha Vivid, Shaman King, Dragonball, Yu Yu Hakusho or even the Law of Ueki. That being said, I have seen worse series. At least the backgrounds are nice and most of its flaws, though glaring, veer more towards stupidity than they do towards painfully terrible to watch. As such, my final rating is a 3/10. Next week I'm going to look at Boku dake ga Inai Machi. Hopefully, it will be better than this was.",

            "content": "Basically this is my first review I feel like I should give one because  I enjoyed  watching this\r\nI noticed that all anime that aired this  fall has an MC wielding swords to be on every single Anime : Noragami Aragato, Owari no Seraph ,Taimado Gakuen 35 Shiken Shoutai, and Gakusen Toshi Asterisk\r\n(Story)\r\nSo the story was awesome and somehow quite similar to another anime that finished also: Gakusen Toshi Asterisk .  Its pretty much cliche to me that every anime in a school life the MC starts of weak and an exchange student appears that happens to be a potential love interest.So i give this a 10/10 because every episode I watched was filled with drama and keeps you hanging  and waiting what would happen, you'll get feelings like shit is about to get down.\\n\\n\r\n(Art)\\n\r\nMeh art style was great and fight scenes were satisfying to watch you wouldn't  feel disappointed  on how the scenes were animated . \\n\\n\\n\r\n(Sound)\\n\r\nClearly am I the only one that felt the OP and ED were very unlikely  the same to other anime that feeling when you cant skip an OP well the music fits the story very well and its ED. What I can say  to the sounds i love how every match is about to start the battle announcer english voice of the match commencing  just love that part the fight scenes sounds was dope too. Oh that feeling when you hear those sounds it gives a goosebump feeling thats what I love on the sounds of this anime\\n\\n\r\n(Character)\\n\r\nThis was the reason why I loved  the anime so bad the character  progression from the MC and the other characters as well. Mainly the MC was very mysterious when it comes to his powers an F-Rank Magical Knight that has no magical abilities challenges an A rank , basically you'd expect him to win because he's the star of the show but thats just amazing about the MC himself. The other characters are cool too they have their own backstory to tell.\\n\\n\\n\r\n I could rewatch this anime over and over and not get tired of it wished it had a second season .\\n\\n",

            "content": "=================\r\n                  INTRO\r\n=================\r\nI entered this series expecting it to be just another generic harem school battle anime. Needless to say, my expectations were pretty low. \r\nAfter finishing the final episode, I ended up really enjoying it.\r\n=================\r\n             THE REVIEW\r\n=================\r\nDespite having a harem atmosphere this series is so far from being one. You would think that the MC is a dense gary stu just like any other Harem Battle MCs but Ikki is really AN ALPHA MALE. He hasa purpose, he knows what he wants, and he works hard to attain it even though he has no talent. No bullshits, no excuses, and no melodramatic moments. HE JUST DOES IT. Because of that attitude he gets the girl early on in the series.\\n\\n\r\nStella, the heroine, is also pretty great. Don't let this big breasted pink haired tsundere deceive you. She is strong, she can handle herself, and she is in love with Ikki. The dynamic between the two is really enjoyable to watch. Their dialogues are well grounded and do not insult the audience' intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the little sister and the daughter of the sword master, the side characters are a little weak. Little background information were provided which I found a little irksome.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall plot is also something we have seen countless of times. MC is shunned and is considered weak, enters a school and a tournament ensues, and slowly wins until he reaches the top.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight animation was pretty good to be honest. The movements were fluid and when coupled with some nicely placed artistic touches, were some of the nicest fights that I've seen with this kind of show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ikki and Stella were the stars of the show. Their interactions are pretty sweet and fun and I had a great time watching the two of them.\\n\\n\r\n=================\\n\r\n             VERDICT\\n\r\n=================\\n\\n\r\nWhat should have been a mediocre show turned out to be a nice surprise. Although it might not be talked about for months to come, everyone should at least give this a chance and just enjoy it. So I'll give it...\\n\\n\r\n7.4/10!\\n\\n\r\nThe two leads really carried the shortcomings of the show. Surely, a contender for anime's best couple of the year. Although the flaws are glaring, most viewers would find enjoyment if they stop criticizing and just watch the show for what it is.",

            "content": "There are spoilers below, but this anime is so generic you\u2019ll predict everything anyway. \r\nGenerally, I\u2019m all for tournaments, sword fights, high-fantasy, and adventure anime, but Rakudai fell flat on its face with crappy characters, cliches, and plot holes. \r\n\u3010Story\u3011\r\n4/10 \u2014 Rakudai Kishi no Calvary (which will be shortened here as \u201cRakudai\u201d) follows the story of Ikki Kurogane a knight with the nickname \u2018The Worst One\u2019 due to his lackluster magical skills. However, despite what everybody believes, Ikki actually possesses extraordinary skill and fighting ability. After beating the A-rank princess-knight Stella Vermillion in battle, the two team up (sort of) to battle through the SevenStar Sword Festival in order to establish themselves as the best knights. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Rakudai is fairly generic these days in anime, but for me I still love this type of storyline. Unfortunately, the execution of Rakudai was pretty lame and heavily relies on cliches and tropes. You\u2019ll see the same run-of-the-mill junk that has been done to death in the anime world: a guy walking in on a girl while she\u2019s dressing, incest, several jealous guys that pick a fight with the MC because why not, etc. \\n\\n\r\nFor all the cliches this anime includes, it also leaves plenty of room for plot holes, too! Not once does the anime try to explain what knights are/what their duty is. Are they supposed to be the police of the world? Are they just people gifted with powers from birth? What are they and what is their purpose? What do they even use these powers for anyway? We never find out and there are no attempts made to explain. As another review mentioned, this makes the Seven Star Festival seem pretty\u2026 useless. Participants are paired up to fight in death-matches because\u2026 why? To determine the strongest, you say? So basically this is just a sporting event? Okay\u2026 so what happens after the tournament? Are apprentice knights hired as bodyguards for people? Clearly not, since many of the top students (Touka Touma, for example) are still attending school even after the tournament ends. So\u2026 what is the purpose of knights? The anime never explains. I know some might say, \u201cwell, if Rakudai gets a second season, they\u2019ll explain some of these things!\u201d but that to me is a pretty lame excuse. You don\u2019t give someone subpar information and expect them to be interested in what\u2019s to come. Even if this anime were slated for a second season, I shouldn\u2019t have to wait to get basic expository details.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue I found is that most of the battles in Rakudai (an action-tournament anime) aren\u2019t even tournament-related. Most battles take place outside of school grounds and really aren\u2019t even relevant in the grand scheme of things. When it comes to actual tournament battles, most just flash forward to the end where we see one of the main characters brandish their sword as they\u2019re declared the winner. Only about 3 - 4 fights are shown over the course of the entire series and nearly all (with the exception of one) are Ikki\u2019s. As the main character, this is to be expected, but the fact that his battles all end predictably make the anime dull. \\n\\n\r\nRakudai seems like it had a great plot idea, but it wasn\u2019t approached in an enjoyable or sensical way, thus I give this category a 4.  \\n\\n\r\n\u3010Characters\u3011\\n\\n\r\n2/10 \u2014 The characters of Rakudai are what make this anime intolerable. \\n\\n\r\nIkki Kurogane \u2014 Your flat, overused, \u201ckind-hearted\u201d male protagonist who becomes conveniently oblivious whenever a girl wants to take him to bed. Coming from a family that shunned and isolated him because his knight skills were an epic fail on their record of prestigious knights, Ikki works hard to become a strong knight that will be able to protect others. He\u2019s colorless, having no unique goal in mind that you haven\u2019t seen or heard before. By episode one, Ikki establishes himself as Kirito 2.0. He\u2019s your typical Gary-Stu, complete with a sad past to make you feel as if he actually deserves your pity and has genuine flaws. One of the biggest issues with this show is that Ikki doesn\u2019t have any flaws or weaknesses (because no, not knowing how to deal with the attention of girls is not a character weakness). All of his problems are external rather than internal. The problem isn\u2019t him, it\u2019s the world he lives in. There are no inner demons he has to face, no personality defects he has to overcome, no opponent that *really* will give him a run for his money. He\u2019s basically flawless. When he was younger his magic skills might\u2019ve been crappy, but we never actually SEE this. All we see is the end product of a perfect sagacious swordsmen. In episode 12, after Ikki realizes his father truly doesn\u2019t love him (big surprise), he goes into emo mode for about 10 minutes before his school friends cheer him up. This isn\u2019t an internal struggle and about the closest we ever get to seeing one. Characters like Ikki are hard to root for because you already know he\u2019ll win every battle he steps into. That\u2019s why watching him get beaten down by characters such as Kuraudo and Kirihara was all the more enjoyable, even if it only lasted a few minutes. \\n\\n\r\nStella Vermillion \u2014 She is, shockingly enough, worse than Ikki. Stella Vermillion, princess-knight from a foreign land, wears the label of \u201ctwin-tailed tsundere heroine\u201d and quickly rises to the top of this story\u2019s short-lived list of female horndogs. She\u2019s introduced as the all-powerful A-ranked knight that has the ability to control fire. And of course, throwing away all logic, she loses her first battle on the first day of her enrollment to none other than Ikki Kurogane. (Never mind the fact that she\u2019s an A-ranked knight and doesn\u2019t land a scratch on Ikki yet a C-ranked knight beats Ikki so bad he has to go to the hospital in a later episode\u2026) What sickens me the most about Stella is that she has very little dignity. Ten minutes into the anime, she\u2019s prepared to make Ikki commit suicide for walking in on her while dressing, but later on, that SAME day, she seats herself on top of him and begins stripping him down/touching him out of \u201ccuriosity.\u201d By episode two (which, for viewers, seems like only a day has passed) she\u2019s already \u201cin love\u201d (read: lust) with him. For the next two episodes, her only role is to pine over Ikki and try to maintain a monopoly over him. Ikki himself seems oblivious to her feelings, but don\u2019t worry, he falls for her by episode 4. Buildup and relationship development not included. For the rest of the series, her personality can best be described as that of a desperate, quick-tempered girl that seems to always be in heat (with episode 9 being particularly disturbing). To make matters worse, even though Stella is an A-ranked knight, she loses or becomes incapacitated for almost every single one of her on-screen battles (this doesn\u2019t include tournament duels since they aren\u2019t even shown). Even though she\u2019s the supposed HEROine, you only see her defeat 1 opponent in the entire anime. This makes for a very weak heroine indeed, so I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call her a heroine but more of a side character. Stella is Ikki\u2019s cheerleader and trophy, plain and simple. She\u2019s not meant to be taken seriously as a character that can hold her own, and if she is, the studio should\u2019ve done her justice instead of making her out to be lovesick and needy all the time.\\n\\n\r\nShizuku Kurogane \u2014 A character that had potential, but is forced into the \u2018incest-is-best\u2019 character trope for the simple reason of why not. Misanthropist at large, Shizuku is one of the only Kurogane family members (Ikki\u2019s younger sister) that isn\u2019t out to get Ikki. She\u2019s quiet, analytical, controls water/ice, and French kisses her brother in episode 2 (he doesn\u2019t seem to have a problem with it considering he doesn\u2019t push her away). From the get-go, she\u2019s introduced as having a brother complex, but this aspect of her personality has no relevance whatsoever to the story. After episode 4, it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s \u201cout of the running\u201d for Ikki\u2019s heart, making me wonder why she even had that incestual bit of her personality in the first place. General love and respect for her brother would\u2019ve been enough, but I guess this anime really wanted to hit home the fact that she\u2019s always going to be there for Ikki. That aside, Shizuku actually isn\u2019t that bad of a character, but as much as I rack my brain, I can\u2019t figure out what her purpose is. She doesn\u2019t actually add anything substantial to the plot. If she were removed entirely nothing would be different. \\n\\n\r\nNagi Arisuin \u2014 Alice, as he is referred to, is the only character that isn\u2019t squashed into an archetype. He is introduced as Shizuku\u2019s roommate and appears to be a kind-hearted male (?) that can control shadows. Like Shizuku, he actually wasn\u2019t that bad of a character and became the \u2018wise old owl\u2019 of the four. Sadly enough, he\u2019s one of the better characters this show had to offer, but was barely given any screen time. As a result, he didn\u2019t seem to have much of a purpose, though he did provide cryptic advice from time to time.  \\n\\n\r\n\u3010Art\u3011\\n\\n\r\n4/10 \u2014 I don\u2019t have much to say about the art and sound since they aren\u2019t my prime focus, but for the sake of the review, I\u2019ll leave my two cents. The art is decent; not my favorite but decent enough. Battle scenes were fluid and not bad at times. The art style itself seems as if it were literally ripped from the light novel and given color, which isn\u2019t a bad thing. What was a bit strange, however, was the shine that the characters had in their eyes and hair. It was almost as if the sun was always shining on everyone\u2026 even in a dark room. Perhaps I\u2019m just nitpicking, so I\u2019ll leave it at that. \\n\\n\r\n\u3010Sound\u3011\\n\\n\r\n5/10 \u2014 No part of the soundtrack stood out for its excellence. I admit that while I didn\u2019t listen to the ending, I thought the opening was very catchy and enjoyable. Voice actors were fine and I have no complaints.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u3010Enjoyment / Conclusion\u3011\\n\\n\r\n3/10 \u2014 I can say with honesty that Rakudai was my least favorite part of each week. With very few redeeming traits, I can\u2019t really recommend this anime for anything you wouldn\u2019t find executed better somewhere else. Perhaps if I had to say something positive, the character designs were pretty decent and at least two of the battles kept my attention. Rakudai seemed like it didn\u2019t know what it wanted to do, or rather, it had a plot in mind but didn\u2019t know how to execute it in a sensical way. Annoyingly stupid or pointless characters and over-the-top ecchi scenes made this anime something I didn\u2019t enjoy nor would I recommend. Comparison-wise, Rakudai was like eating a hamburger and trying to find the meat. Sure, the lettuce, pickles, and bun might taste okay, but the real substance just isn\u2019t there. The few good points this story does have (and I found very, very few) are nothing to write home about.   \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is, without a doubt, \u201cThe Worst One\u201d I\u2019ve seen this whole year.",

            "content": "I can easily sum up this anime in one line;\r\n\"Started from the bottom now we here.\" \r\nYep. That's it. That's the whole anime. \r\nChivalry of a Failed Knight was more or less a great watch; it has all the essence of a magical action anime you'd ever want. Minus the flaws which I'd go into to detail with just in a bit.  \r\nThe development of the plot is exactly like Shokugeki no Soma \u2013 or Food Wars if you prefer \u2013 and you'll know what I mean if you decide to watch this anime. There's really no progressing, long-run storyline behind this show \u2013heck, it's just 12 episodes \u2013 and it's just about a guy who starts out being the worst student at his school and he eventually climbs up to the top, and naturally, he makes a friends along the way. Romance between the main pairing did progress quite quickly, almost too quickly, but you grow accustomed to it over time. While all that is in play, throw them in a school setting, give them some swords and magical power and bam, you have Chivalry of a Failed Knight.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters had all this personality in the beginning and well, it declined as the show went on. It didn't all go downhill but I felt like they lacked development quite a bit as the story progressed. I liked Stella in the beginning; she was headstrong and had this flare about her \u2013 and by flare, I mean quite literally \u2013 and as soon as a couple episodes passed, I felt like the writers took that away from her, making her a complete tsundere. Not particularly the kind I'd like to see either. But fear not, she regains some of that personality here and there in the later episodes. In my opinion, Ikki didn't exactly have any character development at all actually. He remained the same from beginning to end to me, which of course was a bit disappointing. There was no real climax that his character undergoes. This also goes for majority of the cast \u2013 they all had great initial personalities and character but it either declined or didn't develop within the span of the 12 episodes. I also felt like characters such as the ones in the student council, Alice (Nagi Arusuin) or the Demon Princess girl (whatever her name was) should have been explored more, they were such interesting characters. \\n\r\nOther than the flaws in the main cast, the villains lacked both screen-time and complexity. The antagonists shown weren't very well strung together into the series as I'd like them to be. There was no depth in their character nor their involvement with the plot or the main cast whatsoever.  \\n\r\nAlso, another thing that bothered me was that major implications \u2013 possibly direct reference and inclusion \u2013 of incest and promoting of incest (damn you, Alice) was also a big no no for me. It's probably a thing in Japan, I don't know, but for me, it was a bit of a turn off. \\n\\n\r\nChivalry of a Failed Knight had generic art like all harem-action-comedy-school-magic based anime but I absolutely loved the concept of Blazers, devices, Noble Arts and all that. Their weapons sort of remind me of Bleach and the fight scenes remind me of Guilty Crown which proves how top-notch they are executed. I for one, think that the action and fighting scenes are especially well made. Each frame is perfection and honestly, I could not ask for anything more. I love everything about the fight scenes, from the way they summon their weapons to the way they use it; it's just all very badass. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Chivalry of a Failed Knight is simply a to-go for some, and a no-go for others. Despite its flaws, like most anime do have, it's a series I recommend you should watch \u2013 just ignore the pinch of incest added into the mix. The only reason why I stuck around was because of the action sequences and awesome magic powers they had. I can't stress enough \u2013 the action is perfect, if only they prolonged some of the fighting scenes. The ending has given me some sort of closure but strongly hints a possibility of a season 2, but we all know that ain't going to happen any time soon. \\n",

You get to see and hear what is happening, and it felt both good and engaging to not feel like the anime is mistaking me with an innocent 10 year old, or whatever is the usual PG-13 target audience.\r\nThis makes the caracter more relatable, the story more engaging, and overall the anime more memorable, thanits competition.

            "content": "This show in no way a ground-breaking story. It's premise is about a high-school battle-academy and tournament that has its share of tropes and fan-service. The main protagonist archetypes are a red-haired fire wielding tsundere and a chivalrous hero that everyone thinks is quite weak, yet turns out to be super-strong. If you think you've heard this before, you have, because it has been used time and again. If that isn't your cup of tea, then I'll tell you right now to avoid the show because you will not enjoy it. For those that don't mind this generic premise and are willing to give ashow the chance to separate itself from the rest of the pack, I present you Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry; you wont be disappointed ;P\\n\\n\r\nOn to the breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10) - Weakest point of the show, simply because it isn't anything that hasn't been done before. It isn't treading any new ground with its tried and true battle-academy story. If you are looking for a super deep and philosophical thought-piece or commentary on some kind of modern ill befallen society, you wont find it here. That said, it is a generic story because it is generally a well-received story that is a simple setup for the rest of the show. It's an average action-fantasy RomCom on the surface, but the story doesn't dally trying to take itself too seriously and simply acts as a vehicle to display entertaining character interactions, some really magnificent fight scenes, and absolutely wonderful romance. And really those are the selling points of the show, especially the romance aspect. They don't waste any time with it. It's direct, it's adorable, and it is something many people have been searching for in the last few years of this genre. It doesn't feel awkward or ham-fisted and it is very endearing. For that reason alone, its story becomes a little more than just average. Not much more mind you, but it stands out a bit from the sea of clones it comfortably resides in.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10) - One of the truly high points of the show for me. The art in this show is by no means perfect, but it is very, *very* good when it wants to be. The character designs, while again generic, are done well enough that they really pop! The colouring on them is very eye-catching and appealing. The backgrounds for this show really shine when in the outdoors, with absolutely breathtaking vista shots peppered throughout. The colour and contrast are, simply put, beautiful, and really a joy to feast your eyes upon. Many anime lately love to go the bland, washed-out, but very efficient look; while such a look is quite clean, it doesn't feel as warm as Rakudai's style. The stylization that pops up a lot is very interesting as well, and really fits into the look and feel of the show. It makes the last couple of episodes especially quite unique looking. Honestly, I don't think they could have gone with a more suitable art style for Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, so props to Silver Link for that. I also have to give a shout-out to the animation for the OP of this show, which is just a work of art. Best opening animation of the season for me. The animation for many of the fights has been absolutely mind-blowing as well, and they have been a real treat when they show up periodically in the show. There have been some Ufotable-level particle affects going on in some of the later episodes as well. Episode 10 especially had one of the best fight scenes of 2015 imo.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) - Another strong point of the show is its sound. Whoever mixed this show is really, really good. The OP song choice catches you immediately and pulls you into the fun adventure you're about to go on for the next 20 minutes. It's definitely going to find a place on my mp3 player. The soundtrack throughout the show is very well adapted for what's going on visually, from the quirky tracks during the moments of levity, to the epic and hopeful tracks during the well-choreographed action, to the light string and piano compositions during the touching romantic moments and heroics. The sound team really did a top-notch job on this show. It's a pleasure to listen to. They also but a decent amount of work into the Foley for this show, which is subtle, but very engaging. The only unfortunate complaint I have with the sound is that the ED feels really out-of-place with the rest of the show, and honestly just isn't that good, so I can't really rate the sound any higher because of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10) - As I mentioned above, the characters are based around generic archetypes. Considering the amount of red-headed tsunderes that permeate anime lately, that should really not come as any surprise. However I have to give credit where credit is due for Rakudai changing it up a bit to make the characters feel like more than simple cardboard cut-outs and like something truly their own. The main male lead right off the bat is immediately subjected to a common \"walk in on naked girl\" trope in the very first episode, but rather than go the blabbering, terrified-of-the-female-form route that MCs traditionally do, Ikki decides to take it upon himself to make it even with the girl in probably one of the funniest laugh-out-loud moments of the season. I'll spare the spoiler, but it really immediately makes Ikki stand out from the pack of his generic cousins and tells you the kind of show you are in for right at the outset. Ikki comes off as a much more personable and confident human being as a result, and he is quite affable for most of the show, making it easy to root for him. Stella as well breaks the currently standard trope of tsundere and opts to be the good kind, more dere than tsun. While initially adversarial, their relationship quickly becomes one of mutual respect that is so dearly missing from anime romances as of late. Their interactions are truly heart-warming, especially in episodes 4 and 5. Stella also has a truly stand-out moment in episode 4 that really delivers on the emotional aspect and makes her character seem like an actually relateable and kind-hearted person. The VA earned her keep for that speech. Likewise Ikki has a few solid humanizing moments as well despite the rest of his grandeur. Their relationship progression is definitely something unique in this sub-genre and is a real pleasure to follow along with. Of course you have the rest of the character cast which is interesting as well. They all do their part in adding to the general feel and aesthetic of the show. Alice (an actually normally portrayed transgender person, unheard of, I know) is great fun to watch and has some genuinely cool pep-talks, the antagonists do their part to seem genuinely distasteful but human, and of course Ikki's sister has done a fairly admirable job of growing beyond the traditional bro-con mold and actually become a character I don't fully understand, but respect. Overall the characters do a great job of bringing the show to life and their interactions are truly appreciable. The romance especially in this show is very, very well done and heart-warming beyond anything I've seen from the sub-genre in a little while.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10) - I can't in good conscience give this show anything less than top marks for enjoyment. I can't give it a 10 because honestly there are a couple points in the show which are just cringe-worthy to the extreme (episode 2 was a particularly low point you just have to trudge past), but the positives of this show thankfully overshadow those lesser moments, especially once you hit episode 4+. The show doesn't necessarily start out strong, but it was definitely one of the most rapidly-improved shows I've seen over the course of a season. The humour is light-hearted and fun, the ecchi for the most part is tolerable and occasionally fits in context, the characters are just such a joy to watch, and the art style is just absolutely stunning, especially during some of the absolutely breathtaking fight scenes. It's quite a satisfying and fulfilling show if you can get past its generic characteristics, and I can again not overstate the well-crafted and surprisingly mature romance for its genre (once the show regurgitates some tropes out of its system).\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10) - So after calculating my aggregate scores, I give Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry a solid 8 out of 10. It starts out with a very generic premise, but tries to differentiate itself from the pack without losing the things that people do enjoy about those standard tropes. The characters are great fun to watch, even if not all that original, the visuals and sound are just fantastic for the senses, and the budding romance is utterly refreshing for this generally harem-packed genre. For those that want fan-service, it has enough to keep you enticed, and for those that hate it, such as myself, it is *usually* tame enough not to dissuade you and is often absent in the latter half of the show. The whole show has been a barrel of fun to watch and it got better and better with each passing episode, much to the delight of the LN readers. A couple of episodes were just there for exposition which the show direly needed at times, but kept lively with humour sprinkled throughout. If this kind of generic premise doesn't scare you away initially, I'm sure most viewers will find something about the show to enjoy. I, for one, hope for a second season!",

The seriousness of it is clearly scene with brilliant art style changes.\r\nThe only thing i would say against this anime is that the soundtrack was not on par with the rest of it\r\nDespite this itis still definitely a 10/10 for me",

            "content": "Rakudai Kishi no Calvary is part of the sea of fantasy/school anime out there. Good news is, it's not part of the mediocrity we've come to expect from this genre.  Some anime, such as Asterisk War and Tokyo Ravens, definitely made me realize why this genre is so popular nowadays.  OP male MC who eventually attracts a harem of archetypes- check.   High school setting so you don't feel like too much of a perv for enjoying said archetypes- check.  Magic and fight scenes that only temporarily distract you from the lack of character development-check.  So little work to appealto a shounen/seinen audience.  Now that I've significantly bashed the genre, I can tell you that Rakudai Kishi no Calvary definitely stands above that.  Ever wanted to see a school/magic anime done correctly?  Look no further.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 7\\n\r\nStarting off with a... clich\u00e9.  Nothing new here.  MC meets princess, tournament, and battles ensue.  So why did I give it a 7?  Mostly the pacing.  The show's pacing felt just right, now rushing (Tokyo Ravens) or dragging (IS) too much.  Other than that, nothing significant.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 9\\n\r\nThe best part of the show for me.  The characters are detailed and the backgrounds are more than sufficient.  The fighting animation was exceptionally fluid and never dragged unnecessarily (think Kara no Kyoukai).  And some scenes were, uhm, \"exciting\".\\n\\n\r\nSound- 8\\n\r\nNothing to say 'cept that I liked the OP and OST was above average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 8 \\n\r\nIkki Kurogane isn't your everyday main character.  Imma say it- he has personality. *GASP*  He works hard for his goal, as he wasn't born with natural talent, and feels like a person.  His interactions and emotions are all at least somewhat realistic\\n\r\nStella Vermillion, our other lead, isn't nearly as unique.  Standard red-headed spoiled tsundere princess, although she's not so spoiled as the series goes on.  Oh well, at least she's honest about her feelings (more than I can say for a lot of main female characters).\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing- you may notice that this anime is tagged as \"romance\" and not \"harem\".  Surprisingly,  Rakudai Kishi no Calvary has a fully fleshed out romance that develops past the \"first kiss\".  Nice job, Rakudai, nice job.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8\\n\r\n  This show, while not original, was damn entertaining at some times and the romance really helped it feel more complete than a lot of others.  The way it ended way was awesome.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8\\n\r\n Give it a try.  It's only 12 episodes, and even if you don't like the characters, at least you can enjoy the fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nHere's to season 2!",

            "content": "Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry was a show that started off promising but took a really drastic downhill slide about halfway through and never stopped sliding. I'm writing this review due in large part to both my disappointment with the show as well as my surprise that it is rated as well as it is here on MAL in comparison to what I scored it (7.66 at the time of this review).\r\nAs mentioned, it starts off rather promising. The first couple episodes do a good job of establishing the protagonist Ikki as a likeable underdog who is a much better fighter than what his test scoresshow he is. I got a real Tatsuya vibe from Mahouka in the early parts of the show. Stella is quickly established as the main girl and his love interest (more on that further down) and is a cliche yet still likeable tsundere. As the show goes on, Ikki's underdog status just gets milked for way more than its worth and Stella becomes more and more annoying. The side characters are much more likeable than the two main characters, with Shizuku (Ikki's imouto) and Alice (Shizuku's roomate) essentially stealing the show most of the time. The story begins to fall apart also. The Sword Eater arc in the middle of the show was when it really began to go downhill. It was just a boring arc with a disappointing final fight. It really felt like filler honestly. Lastly, the last arc... just... was terrible. I won't give any spoilers as to why, but let's just say that the EXTREMELY forced drama and the asspulls are strong in the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe show makes it pretty clear early on that it is a very action-oriented anime that is structured to where enjoyment heavily relies on the fights and the build-up to the fights. The problem is that most of the fights are not that good. The fight between Shizuku and Toudou is honestly a great 9/10 fight and really the highlight of the show, but most all of the other fights were really disappointing- the final fight in episode 12 especially. Another complaint I had with the show in regards to the fights is that way too many of the fights happen off-screen. Granted, since most all the fights are disappointing anyway it may be a moot point but it still made everything feel super rushed reagardless. The plot revolves around the Seven Stars Battle Festival which is essentially a giant tournament. Of all the fights that take place, Ikki's fights are pretty much the only ones you see happen. One of Shizuku's fights and one of Stella's fights are the only other ones shown. Alice gets no fights and his abilities are still completely unkown. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound in the show is not terrible. Pretty good action music for some of the fights, but overall it's really forgettable. However the OP and ED are, to put it bluntly, just plain bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has many bad aspects, and the art is definitely one of its worst ones (no pun intended). The characters themselves look nice usually but the environments look really bad. Worst of all is the colors. The colors just look dirty- that's the only way I know to describe it. The entire show just has a really dirty gray tint to it, and none of the colors shine the way that one would expect them to in an anime. There is also a very unique choice (and not in a good way) of coloring done with the animation during the important fight scenes, such as the Sword Eater fight and the final fight. All the colors on-screen are scrapped and the show is animated in pure black and gray with only the characters' eyes still retaining their color. It's definitely a unique strategy to emphasizing the fight scenes but it's utterly pointless and really doesn't look good at all. It made me shake my head and wonder who the hell thought of it more than anything. \\n\\n\r\nI'm going to assume that people are rating the show as well as they are on here because of the romance between Stella and Ikki. Unlike most romances that occur in anime there is actual progress made in the romance throughout the story. It has a fairly consistent progression in-plot of the romance progressing and I guess people are a sucker for that considering that its a rarity for an anime to actually progress a romance in-plot like that. That being said, I still found the romance cheesy. It developed way too fast and I felt like its role in the story was really forced and overblown. But again, it did develop which is a rarity, so I'll assume most people rating this show are overlooking all its other flaws because they're a sucker for that or something. \\n\\n",

            "content": "It may seem pointless to write a review of this show four years after it came out, but what the hell. \r\nI started watching this show for two reasons: 1. I found the dub on Hulu and I like having something playing in the background while playing video games; 2. I was given the impression that this would be a show that was a straight 12 episodes of a tournament arc with cool fights. I was severely mislead and disappointed\r\nStory 4/10: Where to begin? I already mentioned how I was set up for disappointment with this series, but I can't stress enough how this justturned out to be such a dumpster fire. We start by getting introduced to the male lead, Ikki, the \"worst\" student at the academy, and the female lead, Stella, who is a princess and top-ranked fighter. After a chance encounter in a dorm room, they settle a nudity-centered misunderstanding in a practice match. Worst guy vs. top girl? How unfair of a match up that they put her against an anime protagonist. This is where the series starts going downhill because out of the countless tournament matches that these two are put in after this, only maybe only three last more than a minute: first being Ikki's first match, second not even being a match in the tournament, and the third being fought by Ikki's sister (which turned out to be the greatest fight of the series and barely had plot relevance).\\n\\n\r\nAll of the time that should have been spent on the fights was instead given to the most awkward, horny, juvenile, poorly written romance between the two main characters. My biggest example of this would be what would normally be flagged as a spoiler for any other show, but not this one: in the middle of the series Ikki and Stella get assigned their next opponents at the same time and they are each given a member of the student council, followed by a vague introduction scene of the two members saying how Ikki and Stella won't stand a chance against them. Any other show would have this introduce the increasingly powerful student council member arc...instead the next episodes starts with the announcer saying how Ikki and Stella both just won their matches and the student council becomes irrelevant because they're all friends now since they're so strong.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: Here is the other major disappointment for this series, the art. The animation around the weapons and magic in this series is surprisingly wonderful, which only adds to how unfortunate it is that this show is mislabeled as an action series.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: Never any real opinions on this category for shows that aren't music focused series. No outstanding soundtrack, but my ears didn't bleed, so seven.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2/10: These characters might just be a little worse than generic anime characters. Ikki is flagged as a F-rank student because his hidden abilities are things that the school doesn't measure, so that's enough for every character to suddenly defer to him as the go-to for all problem solving and only hope for beating strong opponents. As for his actual character, it's almost as if the writers made him and said \"look, our male lead drinks his respect women juice!\" except behind the scenes they didn't actually want to buy the name brand juice and got the generic brand that's more sugar than anything else. Stella was being built-up to be this hard working, strong, A-rank student, so naturally she just starts thirsting after the person with the worst reputation in the school in the most virgin way because he beat her in their first fight. Throw in an almost as thirsty sister and you have a middle school level rivalry with equally as mature insults. Alice, an openly trans character, is probably the best of them and balances intelligence with just being around the main characters for a fun time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: What I enjoyed most about this series was the extremely awkward dub. The lines for this show are so awkward in English that I'm motivated to make a compilation video of the best ones. Example: Stella being told that one reason she's high maintenance is because it probably takes a whole team of people to get her bra on in the morning.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10: Referring back to how I went in thinking this would be a show that was 90% tournament arc, my overall score for this isn't that surprising (unless you're surprised that I didn't give it a 1). But there's something more important, fan service is almost unavoidable in these kinds of series, but I'm able to look past that if the story and fight sequences can make up for it. This show did the opposite and gutted their fight scenes in favor of the aforementioned romance and fan service while teasing us throughout the series that they had the full capability to actually choreograph really good fight scenes.",

Yes the couple Ikki/Stella is cute but sincerely Stella is a stereotyped princess character with the typical tsundere personality. The series tries to make her strong but in the end she's just a sort of cheerlader for Ikki.\r\nThe story isn't original and it is pretty boring. The powers are cool, i admit it, but the fighting choreographies are mediocre. The art is pretty good, for an ecchi anime, the characters are cool and even the art style of some scenes are awesome.But just that. Nothing more, nothing less. The characters are boring. Ikki is the typical protagonist overpowered that wins every fight and is surrounded by every single girl in the show. His story with Shizuku is horrible (incest, again?!!). The psychology of most of the characters is absent or badly treated. Personally i liked Ayase more than Stella but it's just a matter of tastes. \\n\\n\r\nI think that the worst thing about Rakudai Kinshi No Cavalry is the fact that it expects to be a serious anime with good characters but at the end it's just an ecchi anime with some action. Ikki's story isn't so special this \"Worst One\" that represents those without talent is just the typical main character that is always a good guy, is overpowered as hell and never loses. Adding the romance didn't make the anime special or more interesting. If i think about it, the romance theme, made the anime more stodgy.\\n",

            "content": "*This review contains spoilers.*\r\nRakudai Kishi no Cavalry uses one of the most common settings of this decade and desperately tries to be different than any other show of its kind. On a superficial level, yes, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry has some unique points that make it stand out from other shows but beyond the surface it is essentially no different.\r\nThe first episode has a promising start with Ikki Kurogane, our protagonist, voicing his thoughts about the discrepancy between real talent and hard work. What could have been an interesting theme for the show is basically thrown out of the window after the opening and nevermentioned again. The next thing that happens is that we are thrown into setting that is never really explored: There exist people called Blazers who can use some kind of magic and our protagonist strives to be a Mage Knight. He is also the worst student at his school but he just so happens to meet Stella Vermillion, a princess from another country who is one of the strongest Blazers there. Their meeting should turn out as fate however, as the school's director assigns Stella to live in the same room with Ikki! As far as world-building goes, we don't ever learn anything. What even is the purpose of a Mage Knight? What country does Stella come from? What does the structure of the world look like? \\n\\n\r\nThe story progresses in a linear and mostly predictable fashion. I say \"mostly\" because starting with episode 5, Ikki and Stella have become a couple. Now this is something that actually makes Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry stand out from other shows of its kind, but as I said above: This is only a superficial level. The generally high pacing of this show takes away the impact from most of the turns this story has. This is especially important when you consider Ikkis and Stellas relationship: We barely see them developing their friendship and the Anime basically jumps to them confessing their love to each other after just 4 episodes. For me, Ikki and Stella becoming a couple feels kind of undeserved because it lacks the proper buildup and my investment with their relationship was kind of low. Other Light Novel adaptations have done this way better. However, I won't deny that there are nevertheless a handful of romantic moments between Ikki and Stella. It's not much, but I remember 2 or 3 scenes that I found genuinely appealing.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the other story elements go, they, too, are nothing to get invested about. Ikki introduces himself as the worst student due to way the rating system works and honestly the idea of a protagonist that isn't overpowered is kind of refreshing, but the idea is subverted pretty fast and it turns out that Ikki is actually a skilled fighter and has no trouble beating anyone who stands in his way. I wasn't even surprised that it turned out this way, but I was just hoping it would not.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the Action in this show was actually decent. It's centered mostly around the school's tournament to determine the participants of the 7-star-tournament. Looking at the craftsmanship, the animations were gorgeous and at times different perspectives, image ratios or colors were used and that is something other shows of this kind don't have to offer. However I found the Action to be lacking in one specific aspect: The story surrounding it. It essentially lacked the thrill that other shows have to offer as the stakes aren't exactly high. Yes, it's a school tournament and it would be great for Ikki to win it, but losing here wouldn't be the end of the world for him, especially considering that this 7-star-tournament seems to happen once every year and he basically could always have a second chance to secure his spot there.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is further hampered by its stereotypical and shallow characters. No character is unique in any way and most of the characters have only one or two personality traits. I noticed this especially with Shizuku as she basically only exists to have a brother-complex. It's her motivation and her goal is to have Ikki accepted by her family and she has trained hard for that and ... yeah basically her life is centered around her brother to varying degrees. Stella is the average tsundere and seems to be very competitive, Ikki is the average nice guy protagonist who has some shining moments and so on and so on. On the other hand, some introductions of female characters are botchered by fanservice. Toukas introduction was really well done, she was presented as very powerful and badass, which is both fitting to her status as the school's strongest Blazer. But that impression of her is thrown out of the window just one episode later when our hero team visits the student councils room where Touka is shown as clumsy, tripping on a book and having her panties exposed. I don't think this is kind of comedy I'm looking for in Anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis show's self-awareness also doesn't make it extraordinarily witted. I can see that one might find it funny when Ikki returns to his room in the first episode, meets a changing Stella and in turn begins to take off his clothes too as a subversion of one of the worst clich\u00e9s of Anime. Or in episode 2 when Ikki mentions his sister entering his school too, Stella wonders if he is going to tell her that they aren't related by blood (everyone who has a bit experience with Anime knows that sisters in Anime tend to be step-sisters). Again, on a superficial level, this may seem funny but this show doesn't play with those tropes, it's just a little bit aware of using them. I don't see how that qualifies as clever.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there is one other aspect I should mention and that is ecchi. Opinions on ecchi are generally divided, but luckily Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry doesn't try to be a borderline-hentai. There is usually only one or two scenes per episode that uses an extensive amount of ecchi but it's not on the level of High School DxD or Shinmai Maou no Testament. That said, with it's clean and attractive character designs, ecchi in this show is at least visually appealing. The cabin scene where Ikki takes Stellas clothes off was also oddly atmospheric and tame and not bluntly offensive. I haven't seen a scene like this in an ecchi Anime in a long time. +1\\n\\n\r\nWell? Granted, I have seen worse Anime than Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry. I don't think this show is good, but it's not the worst show either. I guess if you're a fan of similar Anime like the Irregular at Magic High then you probably will enjoy Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry too.",

Ikki litterally beat the strongest student joigning the school that year so it seems normal torise that fast in popularity and it's quite a breath of fresh air from Naruto for example (around 400 episodes to become the hero of just a goddamn village).\\n\\n\r\nThen the setting, high school magic sword tournament and ecchi. No originality right, well originality is great but i don't think it's necessary if something is executed well (which in my opinion is the case of this show), especially when you think that we are 7 billion humans on this sh*tty planet, hard to find originality right.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime looked good nothing to say on that.\\n\\n\r\nThe ecchi in my opinion was well placed, I think it must only be used for comedic purpose (if not just make a hentai why bother hiding the parts?) and this is what happens in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance was there, heartwarming sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights are great especially the last one, it's my favorite, these effects though.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the story is not original but great\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I'd say that I think Rakudai Kishi No Cavalry is one of the most underrated/reviewed to fast animes in the world.

            "content": "A review of Rakidai Kisihi no Cavalry \r\nNote: i gove scores based on the genres it is in so best example a hentwi would be reviewed as a hentai and nit comoared to the story of Death Note or Cowboy Bebop for example and their will be typos.\r\nStory (8.2) :In evey season we normally get a anime like this a story where the main guy is weak at first or considered weak and unskilled and meets a girl/s who are genrally considered great or good students with what ability the anime is exploring (this case swordsmanship and magic) and at the end or near ata end of the first main arc there is a tournament. This sometimes makes the story predictable as i could guess situations but it has a certain flare.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing really special about the anime from a story perspective we have seen this before and will give similar anime in the recommendations but this anime has some notable features to stand out;\\n\r\n- a developed love story that is decent and enjoyable. It twkes its time to build the relationship and give them arguments so they can express their feelings and how they want to approach the relationship. As it is not just a harem with a single kiss at the end or whatever\\n\r\n- the harem is not a traditional harem or a harem at all (good for some people bad for other people)\\n\r\n- the story in the manga is still ongoing and the anime just left off at a good place from the manga so a second season is likely or just read the manga. \\n\r\n-fan service is in the series but doesnt get in the way of a godd story like Highschool DXD or Highschool of the Dead (even though i love thoes anime and fan service u just got to enjoy a good sereis every now and then).\\n\r\n- ecchi and harem tropes the anime does break them after it settles down and brings them up every now and then, some may think this is a problem some will not, but this helps bring the story out and stand apart from the rest of the similar anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.9): the characters are another strong point of the show som of the designs are not too unique or original but have a nice feel and good look towards them. Thencharacter interactions between them are quite clich\u00e9 for the type of anime as you get you couple of genral harem girls, but they do expand on the heroine quite a bit as well as the mains sister. Now i am going to go through who i consider a main and side the i feel worth noting and give you a breif talk anout and a individual score.\\n\\n\r\nMAIN: \\n\r\nIKKI (main hero) - he is nothing special just a copy and paste of other characters with their own little spin of a tragic backstory and different personality so they tried and i would say they succeeded with some success. (6.8)\\n\r\nStella (makn heroine) - the genral princess and great student who first meets Ikki socshe must be his love interest right? Yes but that aside i feel like they tried to make her stand out and give her a lot of development. In turn, i feel she is the true main character if the show and that is not a bad thing, in fact it is good and saves the show at points. Definitely my favourite character of the anime. You can tell she has a design similar to other girls like my profile pic or Rias ect. (8 ish)\\n\r\nShizuku (hero sister) - it wouldn't be this type of anime with out a sister this case full blood related who has the hots for her brother. In most cases i quite like it depending on how the character is portrayed and at the beginning i feel she was annoying but by her big fight in the tournament i really came to like her. Her design is pretty much a copy and paste as well with her personality in the end. (6.6)\\n\\n\r\nSIDE:\\n\r\nNagi- i would consider him to be me when im chill and in the anime he has shown possible moments to have a much larger role in the anime but up to the end has remaind a oleasant backround character i like and remain interested in. He has a nice design that is not a generic copy and paste even though i have seen characters designed like him beofre and his personality is quite different and original becuase i have not seen a personality like this in a long time. His diologue is great and is a wisdom character to Ikki and Shizuku a lot of the time.(7.9)\\n\r\nToka (student council president) : we only see her till the second half of the anime but is a intriguing character that we dont see much about although i reckon we would see more in the future either second season or the ongoing manga but either way a generally good character with a design that i get confuesd a lot with the school newspaper girl you will see appear in the anime quite a bit as a side. (6.7)\\n\r\nAyase - she is a friend of Ikki after training with him and if this anime was a normal ecchi/harem in the genre for sure would she have joined his harem and developed a love for him, but we dont get that which i feel is great as otherwise the romance of the anime the try to strive for is ruined as they cant balance a very good romance plot with a harem that all have amsligt romance plot as well. Otherwise the character has a general personality but a great backstory that really gets fleshed out in the anime. (7.2)\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (7.4)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is not a masterpiece like most madhouse productions have the potential but this is not a madhous it is a flying DOG work if i am not mistaken and from what i remeber about them this is probably one of their better works when they pull out the guns with the animation in action and other important scenes. Otherwise, it looks good and smooth but csn tell they took short cuts like most anime which is considered to have masterpiece animation takes to save budget and animation time. While, all considered the animation is good-great and would feel that anyone would considerate below average.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in the fight scens diesnt leave me with my eyes buring and not knowing what i am watching from the amount of shit going on but at times is very quick and like shite what was that bit, but you can tell they put effort into the animation of the fights.\\n\\n\r\nThe color palette is quite warm and eyecatching and i considered good and they will use different styles and chades to fit the mood. Not much else to day then its pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound (7.2):\\n\r\n The anime has a decent soundtrack with some notable tracks that i could remember if someone played them but is not outstanding by all means. Well, actually i could recognise the music, but it would be the situation of where you heard it beofre but not sure where. So it is slightly lacking not below average. The opening is good i would reccomend one watch then skip if need be. The ending is a skip, below average in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe music composer is something Nakagawa, the same person who composed soundtracks for as Code Geass (s1&2) which i dont remeber sadly but if you do take that as you will.\\n\\n\r\nFor sound effect they are pretty good some are your classics but others are great, so just like most anime then.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in the japanese voice actors (watched eng sub) is great as i have heard those actors before in other roles and i can say they did good. Otherwise, i do nit know if there is a dub but from a anime that is not a masterpiece or mainstream i would not imagine anything note worthy or great aboht it so wat h the eng dub for your self.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\r\n The anime is very overlooked and holds a lot of promise for a good second season from its good first season as i will read the manga soon. I will say that the anime is not a right out but it in blu ray as my plan is/was stream it, read the manga, wait until second season announced, buy it.\\n\\n\r\nI would only recommend this show if you into these genres:\\n\\n\r\n- Structured and developed Romance \\n\r\n- Tournaments (generally battle)\\n\r\n- ecchi/harem (hardcore may be put off but should give it a watch especially if you like not too much of the ecchi/harem) \\n\r\n- Simple Story\\n\r\n- School setting\\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend this if you sre looking for:\\n\r\n- a original plot as this has been done a lot \\n\r\n- Complex Story so Dearh note esq.\\n\r\n- a proper borderline ecchi/harem\\n\\n\r\nAnime reccomendations:\\n\r\n-Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei\\n\r\n-Toraru Majutsu no Index\\n\r\n-Strike the Blood\\n\r\n-Infinate Stratos\\n\r\n- Highschool DxD",

            "content": "It sure is true that the action-based harem genre seems to be converging on a single formula. If you've watched Mahouka, Taimadou Gakuen, Shinmai Maou, or Asterisk War you'll be getting some level of deja-vu here. This slight variation of the premise features a protagonist who is actually pretty strong, but ranked as the \"worst one\" in the school due to society's failure to adapt a reasonable standardized test. This is mostly spearheaded by his family, which seems to want to disown him based on some hand-wavy explanation. Our hero walks home one day to find a girl, undressed in his room. Yep, this tsundereis a princess of high magical ability and yep this tsundere is weak against compliments. Finding out that they are now roommates at the request of the school chair, they are forced to accept each other, and perhaps more?\\n\\n\r\nThough the plot follows an all-too-familiar path, this show is pretty entertaining overall. In addition, unlike others in the genre, this is less of a harem and more of a couple with a third and forth wheel. If you're looking for a standout action-based harem in the season, unfortunately you're not going to find one. They're all decent by my standards and all have their own nuances. Thus without further ado, I shall use my full strength in explicating these nuances.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nOut of all the series listed above, this comes out around average. The show has fair backgrounds and nice colorization but occasionally ends up over-reliant on crappy CGI (see ep. 9 for examples of this). The characters are fair overall as well; I personally liked the character design in other shows such as Grisaia or Shinmai more. You do get some more offbeat characters to spice things up, such as the mysterious teacher Nene and unfathomably ill Yuuri. Facial expressions are fairly average and if anything, perhaps a tad understated in our protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nAs a positive, certain elements of the show are uniquely stylized to give it a special feel - see the OP for a sneak peak at these uncolored, ink-like scenes. The show also delivers when it comes to action, in both physical and magical aspects. All the characters (Blazers) are able to mysteriously pull out weapons, manifestations of their souls, out of thin air in rather intricate animation sequences. They are able to use these weapons as fully physical weapons or \"simulations\" where they somehow only damage the opponent's stamina. All the characters have special attacks that they obviously must scream out prior to the attack. Our protagonist's rather lame special ability is a Kaioken of sorts where he concentrates his power into a five-minute long sprint. I don't know whether this is copying Asterisk or vise-versa but having two protagonists with abilities this similar at the same time is just a bit suspicious. There are random battles throughout the show but it eventually becomes more organized in the form of a tournament- yes, the dreaded tournament. Expect a fair amount of bleeding though nothing particularly gory. The show does have a fair amount of ecchi in numerous forms from the relatively-unintentional (accidental exposure, other girls randomly pushing against protagonists, girls fondling girls, etc.) to the more-intentional (kissing, cuddling, etc.). Though the primary relationship develops pretty far in this show, the ecchi level is below that of Taimadou and far below that of Shinmai.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show is fairly bold when it comes to OP/EDs, perhaps as a ditch effort to make the show unique? It opens with an interesting and almost old-fashioned sounding piece sung by a dude. The show then ends on a piece by Ali Project, which gives not-so subtle hints in style and tonality to Another- obviously in a completely different genre. It's an interesting choice for both but doesn't really give a sense of uniformity. The BGM is standard fare filler, with the exception of a particular tune with parts that sounds like an annoying ringing phone or alarm.\\n\\n\r\nLike many other recent shows in the genre, the cast is a mix of veterans and non-veterans. Shizuka Ishigami does a fair tsundere but not as convincingly as Ayaka Asai in Testament. Likewise, though I have utmost respect for Nao Touyama, I don't think her character in this case was a good match for her particular skills. Overall, the show has a fair VA performance but nothing particularly special.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIkki is born into the Kurogane family, a well-known family with a strong legacy of producing fine Magic Knights. Unfortunately, he did not show much talent early on and was cast aside as a disgrace to his family. Undeterred, Ikki continues to fight to be become a Magic Knight, supposedly using only relentlessness determination. Though successfully enrolled in an academy for Blazers, he is ranked F as his lack of magic talent prohibits him from placing higher. How far will his family go to stop his \"futile\" attempt once and for all? Stella is a stellar A-ranked Blazer who uses fire based attacks to overwhelm foes, she moved from her Empire to Japan and is furious that everyone thinks that her innate talent means that she's never actually put in effort. How will she react when she see's Ikki and his hard-work focused mantra?\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the show is something along the lines of \"love conquers all\" where one's connections form the support needed to overcome hardships and, in this case, ridiculously long odds. The show is divided into three main arcs easily distinguishable by the episode titles. The first one serves as an introduction to the main characters and showcases Ikki's rise from the \"worst one\". The second is somewhat of an aside where Ikki helps another girl, Ayase Ayatsuji. Finally, the last arc details Ikki's struggle against his past, almost similar in a way to Yuuji from Grisaia. Each arc has its own rising action and climax. The battles are engaging and interesting though it is occasionally a bit too repetitive in pattern (Ikki shows advantage but wait! opponent has a special ability and Ikki gets clobbered but wait! Stella is there so Ikki goes rage mode and wins yay). As with other shows, cough Asterisk, the show ends without the tournament being resolved and with lots of open questions.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does have good pacing and remains engaging even through the few filler episodes. I particularly liked the focused relationship approach, and some of the comedic moments caught me off guard enough to laugh out loud. Thus, though it has its shortcomings, the story is pretty decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nFor this show, this is a particularly tough category to rate. I really liked the development and dynamic nature of the Ikki and Stella relationship- it actually goes somewhere unlike the majority of other clones out there. Furthermore, parts of Ikki's personality and abilities reminds me greatly of Tatsuya from Mahouka. However, the good parts are almost completely offset by my dislike of the Shizuku/Alice pair, my dislike of Ayase Ayatsuji, my dislike of the gang-like antagonists, and my dislike of the entire Kurogane family nonsense. In short, the show has an exceptionally good main couple and way too many sub-par supporting characters. While the Stella/Shizuku scuffles do provide some level of entertainment, it pales in comparison with the depth or breadth of relationships in other shows such as Shinmai or Taimadou. Perhaps some of the supporting cast will show more use if there is a sequel, but many characters are introduced without contributing to the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nTo be honest, the genre maybe converging on a single pattern, which may be annoying, but the pattern is actually a good one. I think that overall all the above-mentioned action-based harems are above average. Unfortunately, their strength and weaknesses sort of even out and so choosing the best show starts to feel like picking the NCAA Basketball tournament winner. That being said, this one is particularly notable for its primary relationship and occasionally unexpected humor. If you're looking for something in the genre, you really can't go wrong here, or with any of the others above.",

If you don't want that, scroll up/down now.\r\nIts been a long time since I gave an anime a 10/10!!!\r\nAt first, other reviews said this was a typical harem non-sense. And I kind of bought into it, but had nothing to watch so I decided on this one. I got hooked since episode 1. \r\nWhy? Because the MC is another one that is \"little off\" from the standard dumb as a brick, closed off guy that is super embarrassed about little skin. I'd have to say that he is one of the very rare MC in anime that has admittedto loving a girl and then proposing to her. \\n\\n\r\nNow this anime is far from perfect. The girl characters are so mainstream: pink pigtails, huge breasts, arrogant and short tempered tsundere. And all the other harem details that belong into mainstream. Overpowered underdog MC, charming everyone and getting through against all odds. Nothing of this is bad mind you, just saying its mainstream and has already been seen too many times.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are some moments that captured my attention. The story is relatively okay, but the sound + art is amazing. Something about this anime shines to me. And the best: the MC becomes a man who takes responsibility and admits his feelings.

            "content": "When first starting to watch this anime , I thought this is a generic harem anime that the protagonist have great power and get every girl on their path to their objectives. \r\nStory:(7/10)\r\nThe story is pretty much the school and sword+magic genre, though it show a bit different as it isn't a typical harem that is too common on this type of show, instead, it can shown a new and much enjoyable plot development despite the fact that its setting is too overused that it is hard to deliver a good story under this genre. \r\nArt:(8/10)\r\nThis show have a good art style, with fluent animationand get the character design done well, The battle scene is animated nicely without much flaw. The opening animation is also enjoyable, another point to mention is that this anime have suitable lighting in the battle scene which can lead to a better atmosphere.  But, its art isn't outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nSound:(8/10)\\n\r\nThe voice acting fit the character, although the background song for those battle theme isn't original , it is catchy and it play on right moment. Those music can also bring out the atmosphere well and is entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:(8/10)\\n\r\nThis is the part that surprise me, the male protagonist saw the female protagonist naked in the first episode in this genre is somehow common, its funny how the male react to this incident in this scene. He also has his own will and have a more logical reaction which stand out in this type of anime.\\n\r\nThough the female counterpart is pretty much generic. The way that the 2 main character don't know how to react to their own fear is handled well. The romance in this anime is well done. The side character is mostly generic with a bit different to other series in this genre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:(9/10)\\n\r\nI feel surprised when this anime try to show me that it isn't a generic harem/school anime , but instead have a better character development than those of the similar genre. It have much fewer clich\u00e9 situations, as the character is smarter and don't react so stupid like those generic show of this genre. The art and sound also fit well to this anime. A good point to mention is that it doesn't have a lot ecchi and fanservice scene which is too common and bring not much enjoyment to the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:(8/10)\\n\r\nAnyway, this show is enjoyable and can make you relax yourself while watching it, I would highly recommend this to those who doesn't hate on the school+battle genre while wanting to have a refreshing feeling to this type of anime.",

            "content": "While Rakudai isn't the best anime in the world, but it does more good things than bad. The magical battle academy genre is quite saturated with other shows like Asterisk, Infinite Stratos, and The Irregular. However, Rakudai provides numerous twists to break away from the rest of the pack.\r\nStory: For the most part, it has been decent. It does start off a bit slow (Ep 1-2) and it doesn't help that it begins similarly to Asterisk. However, Silver Link did make a few tweaks for some original flair, such as Ikki stripping to make things \"even\" after accidentally seeing Stella in her undergarments. The pacedefinitely picks up starting Ep 3. At times, though, I feel that the anime goes a bit too fast. For the people who did not read the LN or manga, some parts will be a bit confusing. One thing I deeply appreciate, though, is the romance between Stella and Ikki. Ep 6, 9, 11, and 12 do a good job at advancing their relationship in a believable way and the conclusion to the romance is very satisfactory (i.e. not a harem ending). The show improves on the story in Ep 10, as it delves into Shizuku and Ikki's history a bit more. Shizuku also gets some needed character development. Ep 11 goes a bit fast, but I felt that the use of different artstyles told the story effectively through symbolism and undertones. If I were to watch the first few episodes, the story would've gotten a much lower score, but SL really made a comeback to make it decent. It's not exceptional in any shape or form, but it is definitely adequate.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 7\\n\\n\r\nArt: Arguably the anime's strongest aspect. It's definitely not perfect as there are a few hiccups here and there, but Silver Link did a good job at making Rakudai eye catching. Colors pop out and the fight scenes, especially, are hype. The anime does not stick with one palette and uses a wide variety of colors, scenery, and backgrounds. One good example would be the animation when Kuraudo and Ikki execute Yamata no Orochi and Ten'i Muhou, respectively (Ep 8). Ep 10 gave rise to my most favorite fight of the show. The electricity and water/ice animations, as well as the physical combat, were top notch. The art in Ep 11 was quite something. The first half was normal and then, we get a slew of different styles in the second half. It was a little unexpected, but at the same time, it wasn't forced because what wasn't explained verbally was explained through symbolism. It might be off-putting to some people, but it did its job of non-verbal storytelling. The fight in Ep 12, while extremely short, was animated well. I liked how SL paid attention to the little details when they made this scene.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 9\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is, for the most part, very good. The opening is very catchy and upbeat. I will point out, though, stick with the TV size version. The full version actually kinda sucks &gt;_&lt; Silver Link does a good job at using music to enhance the atmosphere such as the piano &amp; guitar soundtrack for the romantic moments or the percussion soundtrack for the fight scenes. What drags the sound back, however, is the ending song. It just doesn't fit. It's not that it is bad, but the ending is so out of left field. One hiccup is that the last episode uses one track twice. Shows reuse tracks all the time, but to use the same one in one episode is a big no-no.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are nothing original. However, that is not a bad thing if the characterization and development are executed well. I will say that Rakudai does that, most of the time. I like Ikki's attitude. He acts very maturely and as demonstrated throughout the anime, he is very knowledgeable. Stella fits the tsundere mold, but unlike, say Louise from Zero, she's friendly to Ikki and cares for him a lot. Ep 9 does a good job fleshing out her character, portraying her to be very forward, outgoing, and honest. If anything, the romance between Ikki and Stella is arguably Rakudai's main selling point. Very few anime of the same genre ever go this deep. Usually the MC of the battle academy genre is denser than diamonds (Ichika, I'm looking at you) or is stuck with a harem.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters, for the most part, are alright. There can definitely be some improvement in this department. Alice is very quirky, but he also has great insight on how people feel. I kind of wish he got more screentime. Shizuku is a bit annoying with her clinginess to her brother. However, she gets great development in Ep 10 and by the end, I began to feel sympathetic to her. She continues to annoy me less in Ep 11 as she begins to lose that clinginess. I thought Ayase was done well. The seiyuu did a great job showing off a wide variety of personalities and emotions in Ep 6-7. While Tohka hasn't gotten a lot of lines, I do like how she is such a badass in battle. At the same time, she also has a very gentle, altruistic side as shown in the first half of Ep 11. She also plays an indirect role in Ikki's development.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 7\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The fight scenes are a great pleasure to watch, especially the Lorelei vs Raikiri battle. The comedy is fine, though the fanservice is hit-and-miss. Sometimes, it is very funny such as Ikki stripping or the cabin scene in Ep 9. Other times, the fanservice is out of context. The romance also makes this show very enjoyable because other shows of this genre rarely take it seriously.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Rakudai does many things right. While it starts off slowly and generically, it does plenty of things to give its own identity. The art and romance are the strongest points of the anime. What drags it back, though, are the pacing and out-of-context fanservice. The show would've definitely gotten a better from me if it didn't start off slowly. However, I was glad to see it rebound and finish on a high note.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely hope that it gets a second season because I believe Silver Link can make improvements and fix the flaws.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8",

            "content": "Let's talk about Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry.\r\nAnime adaptation of the light novel, in this case written by Riku Misora. The genre in which we could categorize rakudai is romance, action, ecchi and fantasy.\r\nStory\r\nThe history of anime takes place in a world where humans known as blazers are capable of materializing devices, which are usually swords through his soul. This means that each person will have a different weapon. Our protagonist, Ikki Kurogane, known as the Worst One, go into his room and is a very embarrassing situation when one of the best in the academy is changing clothes, in short, he sees her half naked.This will take to deal with it in a duel and the winner will become a kind of slave to the winner because you should always ignore.\\n\r\nBesides that same year a tournament in which the best \"knights\" participate and win kurogane need to graduate from the academy held.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nIkki Kurogane: The protagonist of this anime, known as \"The Worst One'' as he failed in his first year at the academy and theoretically does not have enough level to be magical gentleman. His aspiration is to win the tournament seven swords, because if the do not win will not graduate from the academy he attends. It is a magnificent swordsman showing anger that before he was called loser who is not.\\n\r\nStella Vermillion: This is the main female character in this picture is very attractive addition to being the strongest of the academy. His specialty is to control the fire, at least seen so far.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nWhat most caught my attention in Rakudai is the detail of the battles, do you see yourself immersed in them. We can also put emphasis on the development of the characters, especially Stella, for me is a girl of 10. Another point to note would be the feeling that you spread the anime in certain episodes, rather pulling the end of the season, making be identified with the characters.\\n\r\nThe ecchi in this anime is pretty good; there are also some very erotic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis anime has a good soundtrack in the erotic scenes, battle scenes and dramatic scenes.\\n\r\nIt should be emphasized that the opening and ending are very good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIf you want to see a good anime riddled battles and romance I tell you that you will love the show, so I advise you to give it a try. I must also say that if you expect at the end of each episode will see photos of the most sensual of female characters that appear.\\n",

            "content": "Most magical knight anime are very similar, this particular one takes a slightly different step, by adding a romance plot that goes somewhere, an interesting main character with a harsh past and having some of the best action scenes of 2015. (The video review is up on my channel, but here is the written)\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nChivalry of a Failed Knight story line and setup is rather generic. There is a magical knight tournament for high schools known as the Seven Star Battle Festival. Those who fight in this tournament are known as Blazers, people who materialise weapons to fight in battle. Now the main characterIkki makes a promise with a princess, that he and her together, will make through the selection matches and have one final battle in the last round. Pretty standard story so far.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the overall story is pretty standard, it\u2019s the sub stories in between that what makes this an interesting show. Ikki is dubbed the \u2018Worst One\u2019 all because his magic power isn\u2019t all that great, so a lot of people look down on him and so he has to work his way up to the top, through his own ability rather than relying on the magical power everyone else has. It\u2019s really a character driven story, as we learn about different characters along the way and find out their reasoning for wanting to win the festival. It\u2019s interesting because the build up to each fight felt very meaningful as we get a good insight on to both sides of the fight, and seeing the trials and tribulations each character has to go through. On top of that, there is a romance story as well, between the two main characters that actually go somewhere, and it\u2019s nice to see their relationship build up from there, even though it may be subtle. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIkki Kurogane is the main protagonist of this anime. His personality is rather generic of a normal hero, he\u2019s got a caring personality and obvious about the girls around him. What I found interesting about his character is his past, on how wasn\u2019t allowed to learn anything from professionals because of the way he was born, so everyone neglected him, and we see how hard the struggles were for him to reach the top after being dubbed the \u2018Worst One.\u2019 And I like how he changes the other characters around him, he gets people to respect him and in return he teaches them how to be stronger themselves. Because since he had to learn himself, he has become a very knowledgeable person, while also putting it into practice. Obviously his biggest character development comes in with Stella.\\n\\n\r\nStella Vermillion is the A-Rank knight of the academy. She is considered the strongest knight, because of her abilities. At first she does come across as another tsundere. However after some time, she is actually shown to be someone who is trying to earn respect the right way through hard work, rather than a title. And her interactions with Ikki helps her character develop into a strong character by the end, as she is able to trust herself more and Ikki, as they go out and understand each other more.\\n\\n\r\nShizuku Kurogane is another character that gets quite of time in the show. She is Ikki\u2019s sister with a brother complex. She was the only one to understand Ikki\u2019s situation growing up, she hated the family for mistreating him, and therefor does everything she can for Ikki. Her character shows quite a bit of development as she pretty much stays as she learns what it really means to be a loving sister for Ikki, because her naivety  at first puts everyone off. \\n\\n\r\nWhat Rakudai does very well is give us a lot of different characters and actually give them rather interesting backstories, and it\u2019s not like all the characters are the same, some characters are completely arrogant, some actually are fighting for family, and some fighting for pride. It\u2019s with all these characters, each story arc gets interesting, we see the initial build up to the fight and the resolve. I especially did like Ikki\u2019s build up to his last fight, as we really learn a lot about his character and what he has gone through. The interactions he has with each character felt very meaningful. However, what kind of bugged me was, after the character for each arc was done, we don\u2019t see them that much outside of it, so that may leave some people annoyed. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 10/10, 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and the animation is probably the best thing about Rakudai. The world and character designs itself is rather standard compared to most anime, and that\u2019s a good thing, because it looks good and smooth. Being an ecchi genre as well, you\u2019re going to get fan service, and I would say at least they separate the fan service from the action scenes, but it seems some scenes they were trying to make it emotional, but the fan service kind of was distracting. And also the when do show fan service, it\u2019s pretty revealing, but not nudity. Now to the best part of this anime, the animation for the fight scenes. These were probably one of the most gorgeous action scenes I\u2019ve seen in 2015. Yes it I think it\u2019s up there with Unlimited Blade Works. The special effects for each fight is gorgeous, you really see the fluidity of each element. My favourite use of the art is when Ikki is using his abilities which changes the art style completely, into a monochrome world, and the stronger it is, the more awesome it looks. Also I like how every fight scene the quality never really drops, it just gets better as the series progress, and it\u2019s not simply just sword fights, as there are many other ways to fight as well, so there is quite the variety, and the animation quality never really drops. Probably one of my favourite fights of the year was Shizuku vs Tohka, the strategy behind that fight and the execution by the one character made it really enjoyable. Oh yeah, and the last 2 episode, when they used the monochrome art style, it worked so well at building the hype surrounding the final fight, while really adding to atmosphere of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is in anime, I\u2019ll get to what I love the most soon, so let\u2019s start with the ost. Nothing really stands out too much to make it a great ost, maybe only the second last episode when Ikki was going through a hard time, when the music really added to the atmosphere, but that was probably the help of the art style. The ending song is ok, it\u2019s nothing great in my opinion, it\u2019s a slow pace song with a gothic feel to it. I said I was going to get to my favourite part of the music, which is the opening of hype and epicness. I don\u2019t even care about some of bad grammar in lyrics, but the instrumental, the rock with blues like feel, really is amazing to listen to. Pair that up with the awesome black and white art style opening, and you have yourself such a hype opening with amazing animation at that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first, despite Rakudai really showing nothing new to the genre, it did had a certain appeal I was very entertain by. The comedy in this show is what I think separates it from other genres, as the first episode showed us that it was very aware of itself, and used that to its advantage and had good timing with their jokes. In the second episode it does become more generic, but after that it\u2019s completely a fun anime to watch from there, and the comedy is quite funny. Watching the relationship between Ikki and Stella grow over the course is amusing to watch, because it\u2019s a relationship that actually goes somewhere, albeit not completely deep, but still pretty good. And the best thing about watching this show is the action and fight scenes. Each fight scene is unique and brings out a lot of each character. It\u2019s gorgeous to watch and the strategies that each character goes into each fight, is entertaining to watch.  And every time Ikki uses \u2018Itto Shura\u2019 I always get hype, because there is ass kicking coming. Especially the last battle, that was hyped. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSo for the story of Rakudai, I give it a 7, the concept is really not all that special and setup is rather basic. But I do like the story of aiming to the top, when you\u2019re the bottom and gaining that respect Ikki deserves. Although the overall story is nothing to write home about, the arcs that make up the whole show individually is really remarkable to watch, and they got better as the plot progresses.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound I give it a 10 and 7. The animation is amazing to watch, the fights and the special effects for each magic being used looks really good. Each fight is unique and the animation never really drops during the duration of the show. And I love the art style when Ikki goes into \u2018Itto Shura,\u2019 that Black and White art style just gives more hype. The ost, is nothing special at all, if anything almost forgettable except for some tracks towards the end. However the Opening is amazing, it was my favourite opening of 2015, animation and song wise.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters I give it a 8. I love the development and interactions between Ikki and Stella. It\u2019s a relationship that goes somewhere and they build on it, rather than sticking to the generic harem route. The other characters during their arcs are quite interesting and well developed as well. However I just wished we saw more of them after their respective arcs have finished.\\n\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment I give it a 9. I loved watching this show, the comedy is fun and the character interactions were great. I couldn\u2019t wait for every fight scene, because they all look amazing to watch. Some fan-service may throw you off the mood, but it\u2019s really not that bad. And even though, I loved the last fight, and hype that was built towards it, I still just expected slightly more.\\n\\n\r\nSo for overall score of Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, I give it a 8/10 after rounding it all up. It may not have the most unique concept,  but the smart use of the comedy and romance story that goes along with it, makes it an entertaining watch and the action are great. I recommend this anime to fan of the action and romance genre, or if you want a decent magical knight style anime, this is a pretty good choice. \\n",

However, the main guy, instead of beating around the bush, goes ahead and admits the fault and his feelings. He even calls out the ridiculousness of the situation or words used.\\n\\n\r\nThe guy confesses in the first moments of the screen time they have together, not several episodes later, but in the first moments of his thoughts and interests to her. NOT IN HIS HEAD.\\n\\n\r\nWhat might have usually been the Tsundere girl going off screen in a huff, is instead her stumbling over her words and feelings but still acknowledging the compliment. Wait, isn't she supposed to slap the shit out of his face here?\\n\\n\r\nThe typical embarrassment is still there, the usual banter is still there, the classic situation is used once again, but now we have a different result this time. One that I haven't actually seen anywhere else in the medium.\\n\\n\r\nOver and over this happens again, and boy was it great to have what are the same old set ups of jokes and appeals, turned to a different resolution.\\n\\n\r\nI say it again, they do so with communication. They actually talk it out, not running out of the room, not forgetting like it never happened, and not staying quiet just because.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest one of all, is that when our main couple is having a quarrel, they asked the important questions and even thought and considered the words both persons had said. And the result of it? They kiss and make-up.\\n\\n\r\nThe viewer can clearly see the moment of character forgiveness or change of thought. Not cryptic messages of twingy eye moments and a bit lip that is grunting behind it!\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry but FAWKING FINALLY! Actual believable progression in the growth of a romantic relationship!\\n\\n\r\nI highlighted that because it's the refreshing relief that comes from this show. It knows full well what genre it is in, what fighting action scenes it has, and what they are expected to do from the community. But they have decided to grow their own fresh vegetables instead of picking from the grocery store that everyone goes to.\\n\\n\r\nYes, its that ecchi area, yeah its what you expected, but this time it knows you expect it. They decided to poke back.",

            "content": "Give this kind of clice anime an 8 what are you thinkking about im betting alot of people are thinking but i will give you my reasons. \r\nI wont deny the fanservice with big breasts and erotic plays around in the anime. Since thats just how it is. But what i will say is that besides that this anime gives alot of good aspects. \r\nSo first story for me first time i started to get annoyed by one thing and that is that it felt too much of something taken from Mahouka no rettousei so that is why the story wise i thought this animewas lacking. What gave it its own life was the great battles combined with the progressing story. It wasnt as if they rushed the entire thing through the anime eventhough its only 12 episodes i felt that they didnt rush it too much like many fighting anime are these days. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening gives you a good feel of some of the great art hidden in this anime. For me it make this anime unique though they wont use it alot it still gives this anime its own identity.\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening and ending are both great. Eventhough the ending felt very similar to one of code geass and one to Rozen maiden it still had it great parts. The opening though was even greater it was original for me in many ways and the art used in it made it become greater. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise i wouldnt say that this anime has tons of original ones for that i will admit. But they do have some easy to remember ones like the sister of the MC and her roommate had their own feel to it. I also liked that this main character isnt some monkey with zero in iq. He actually works well and uses hes ability in a way that makes it fun to watch eventhough it pains me to see similarities again with mahouka. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah i enjoyed it the fanservice is just part of the anime but the well made battle scenes and execution of it all made it well worth it. The opening was also unforgettable for me and was one i could watch all over again and find it just as awesome as with the music used in the anime.  So 8/10 is what i would give it since it gave me enjoyment of a different scale but enjoyment that fitted this kinda of anime very well. When it comes to this kind of fighing school , ecchi anime then this one is actually up there.",

            "content": "Plot (7): The magical academy setting has been done before, but not every anime has to come up with something super innovative as long as it is done well. It starts off with the clich\u00e9 \"male MC accidentally enters a room with the female MC changing\" trope. However, unlike most male MCs who freak out, Ikki tried to rectify the situation with a rather... interesting tactic. I was kinda scared that the anime will go overboard with the ecchi-ness, especially after Episode 2. However, the anime really started to pick up for the 3rd and 4th episodes. I liked how the romance between Ikki andStella progressed. It was not too fast nor was it too slow. I have noticed that Silver Link decided to take some liberties by shuffling the material around a bit compared to the manga and LN. For instance, the romance between Ikki and Stella was pushed earlier, though I can see why SL thinks the move was justified: to make the romantic sub-plot more continuous. I didn't mind the idea of shuffling things around, but the execution could've gone better. The Sword Eater arc has been very engaging as it managed to keep me interested in Ayase. Episode 7 uses the often utilized \"the power of friendship\" trope, but it's the execution that counts and it was executed extremely well. Episode 8 attempts to develop Ayase's character a bit more, but it wasn't that much as most of it was Ikki vs. Kuraudo. The plot has been good, but not great. However, I thought Episode 9 did a really great job advancing the romance between Stella and Ikki. While the anime did modify the plot from the LN, it did a decent job. It was a bit rushed, though. Episode 10 is the first time where a supporting character gets the spotlight and Silver Link did not disappoint. Episode 11 goes back to focusing on Ikki (and Stella) and SL did a good job advancing their development. The last episode did a good job concluding the show where the first half is dedicated to some more Ikki development.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9): Character designs aren't original, but again, as long as it is done well, I'm okay with that. The color palette and backgrounds have this \"pop\" that is really appealing to the eye. One very good example would be the pink petals of the Japanese maple trees in Episode 2. The anime has also done a good job using a variety of color palettes and backgrounds such as the dark and dull blizzard in Ikki's flashback. The animations, however, are what takes the cake here. This is especially true in Episodes 3 and 4. They are very clean and use different angles effectively. I also liked, in Episode 5, how Silver Link used animations in a comedic way when the sparkles suddenly disappear when the guys freaked out at Nagi (Alice) Arusuin posing in his swimsuit. The animations show their strength in fight scenes again in Episode 7 and 8, utilizing a variety of angles and color palettes. As for Episode 10... holy crap. I can say that it was the zenith. The animations were intense and dynamic. Superbly done. Episode 11 takes a very interesting route by having the artstyle correlate with the mood and I thought it was done well. While Episode 12 wasn't as risque as the previous episode, it still use some variety in artstyle. The fight, while brief, was animated very well, too.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8): The soundtrack does a very good job at enhancing various moments, whether they be action scenes or romantic scenes. There is a good variety in the instrumentation, ranging from predominantly percussion to a string orchestra with a classical guitar soloist. Certain tracks are reused, but they are spaced out well enough so that they still sound fresh. Episode 7 is a perfect example of how reused tracks are utilized effectively. They did a really good job at enhancing the atmosphere and emotions of various scenes. I stated earlier that I hoped that the anime added some new tracks to keep the old tracks fresh. Thankfully, Silver Link has done that. However, a few tracks have been used a bit too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is very upbeat and perfectly fits with the theme of the anime. I was initially \"meh\" on the ending song. My feelings towards the ED are still pretty neutral, but it's not so bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8): Initially, nothing home to write about in this department (originally a 7), but I thought this aspect gradually improved later on. The main characters fit in the archetypes that have been already used in lots of other anime. Stella is the pink-haired tsundere who initially dislikes the male protagonist because he accidentally peeped on her. However, unlike other tsunderes, the \"dere\" is more dominant than the \"tsun\". In fact, in the anime, Stella is even less \"tsun\" than her manga counterpart. In Episode 9, she is surprisingly quite forward with Ikki at advancing their relationship even further. I am so glad that Ikki isn't the immensely dense male protagonist that annoys me to no end in other anime. I like how he tried to take it upon himself to make things even with Stella after he accidentally peeped on her even though it was goofy. In Episode 6, his head got smashed by a glass bottle and Kuraudo spat on his face as insult to injury, but he kept his cool extremely well. That's the kind of patience I highly admire. I've noticed some people have criticized Ikki for being \"Jesus-kun\" or ass-pulling. However, this is quite false. Episode 8 showed how he can get very into the heat of battle. Episode 9 showed how Ikki isn't OP and unbeatable.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two characters, Shizuku and Alice are also pretty good. Shizuku was pretty hard to figure out, at first. Was she actually romantically infatuated with her brother or was she trying to compensate for Ikki's family's mistreatment of him? Or is there another reason altogether? You will find the answer in Episode 11. She also got good character development in Episode 10.\\n\\n\r\nAlice really reminds me of Jann from Valkyria Chronicles. I really liked his interactions with Shizuku and Kagami. He has also played a significant role to Ikki's development. However, despite his motherly character, there was one tiny instance where he portrays coldness. I will leave you guys to figure out when he does that.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi did a really great job playing as Ayase. Episodes 6 and 7 showcased her incredible range. In just those two episodes, we see a large variety of emotions, from shyness to manipulative sadism to desperation to sadness. As for Ayase's background, she is quite relate-able to Ikki whether they are both swordsmen or had an extremely difficult past. Nothing groundbreaking, but the portrayal of Ayase was very decent overall.\\n\\n\r\nI will talk more about Touka as the next episodes air, but man, what an entrance! Her fight against Shizuku further reinforces her bad-assery. However, in Episode 11, she has a clumsy, but motherly character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9): Rakudai Kishi no Chivalry's action scenes are really fun to watch. While they are its strongest points, in my opinion, it doesn't mean the other aspects are lacking. The romance has progressed nicely and the anime does a great job with the comedy. The ecchi-ness, for the most part, is kept in check. At times, it goes overboard. There was one time where Silver Link thought it was funny to add some wardrobe malfunction to a certain scene in Episode 2 whereas it didn't happen in the manga. That's a really cheap and lazy way to gain some laughs, but thankfully, that was only one time and it happened early. Episode 9 was a good example of fanservice done right, in my opinion. It was not out of context and it was funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (NOT an average of scores of the 5 specific categories) (8): It's a very fun anime to watch. The artstyle, sound, and animations are well done. It has a healthy dose of comedy, action, and romance. The characters, while encompassing generic archetypes, are decent thanks to good development and interactions. Despite appearing to be a harem, it is actually not. I think the quality is decent enough to warrant a 2nd season.",

            "content": "I don't usually watch these types of anime because they seem so generic and unoriginal and comparable with any other action/ecchi/school anime that exists, and there are A LOT. And this is because these types of shows don\u2019t focus on a particular target market but have a bit of everything. Some people watch it for the romance, some for the battle scenes and others for the psychological battles and etc. And the real challenge of the show is how to find the right balance between romance and action so that the people who came for the romance scenes still watch when there's fighting going onand vice versa, which I think \"Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry\" manages to pull off fairly well compared to other shows of its kind.\\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed the romance scenes a bit more than the action scenes because I felt that the fight scenes weren\u2019t animated as well as the romance scenes. A personal pet peeve of mine is when there is too much talking going on during fight scenes in anime explaining everything that\u2019s happening and Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry has a lot of this. It\u2019s fine once in a while to explain fight scenes but when most of the fights are literally people talking and explaining the fights instead of properly showing and animating the fights, it seems really cheap and unenjoyable for people who came to watch the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story? You probably know the story by now; chances are that if you pull out any other anime with a magic school setting you'll actually get something very similar. But just because the show has a generic story, doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be told very well, and as long as you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t mind all the tropes like tsundere, imouto, or overpowered gary stu MC\u2019s with ridiculous plot armor, then you\u2019ll probably enjoy the show. \\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s another reason to watch the show, it\u2019s the opening. Some people overlook openings because they really have nothing to do with the actual show but a good opening sequence like this one can really make a show more enjoyable watching and also entice people to watch it.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is something I wish I\u2019d have seen more of in this anime. There are SO MANY characters which they dump in the show literally just to create a trope and then disappear having almost no impact on the show. And with a show that already has a generic setting, it\u2019s a bit disappointing that they don\u2019t flesh out the characters a bit more so that they have more of an impact to the viewers.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall I found Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry fairly decent, it\u2019s better than most generic harem-ish anime with magic school settings but it\u2019s still just a generic harem-ish anime with a magic school setting. \\n",

Though Rakudai Kishi got a darker and more depressing atmosphere especially towards the end. \r\nRakudai Kishi no Cavalry should be popular with people being favorable towards:\r\nswords/magic/action/romance(\"progressing relationship\")/harem/school/ecchi\r\n;;;NOTABLE THINGS ABOUT THE PLOT;;;\r\n- The plot is pretty much generic being centered around Ikki Kurogane also being called the \"worst one\" who is actually a real monster (cause hes such ahard worker on his training) despite having no magic ability which is an \"unsightly\" thing in his society.\\n\r\n- The romantic relationship develops which I call a big plus no matter the direction\\n\\n\r\n;;;MY OPINION;;;\\n\r\nALL characters in this anime are generic. It's pretty much the same with the story which basicly consists of Ikki always having to overcome some hardship laid out by his cruel and unfair past. Thus he coincidentally expands his harem for which he actually got no need cause he got Stella.\\n\r\nThe characters sometimes lean into the melodramatic but sometimes they get into REALLY depressing situations which mostly find their ends in somebody shouting something embarrasing to help the character in need. I actually hate that stuff.\\n\r\nEven though the characters are all static character types and very generic they are still detailed and sooometimes deviate from their stereotype. Being overused does really not imply being bad.\\n\r\nDespite having so much generic stuff Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is still capable of captivating you. The tension is real. The art is nice. The music fits. The fights got style and action. The romantic relationship is not completly new but definetly not overused and it feels nice.\\n\r\nAnd I must say that the last two episodes really got to me and were worth the depressing athmosphere which they conveyed.\\n\r\nI overall enjoyed the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\n;;;TO-SUM-IT-UP;;;\\n\r\nIf you can take the melodrama, appreciate the few lovely details which lift the anime above average and you enjoy progressing relationships then you will alltogether have spent a really good time with the anime. Althought its far from perfect its at least above average.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've come this far I thank you for taking your time to read and you are welcome to tell me your opinion.",

The Main Character, who always has a crowd of girls around him for some reason, is labeled one of the worst fighters but is actually one of the best. But something that separates Rakudai from every other series is the actual content in the story; the execution of it. Hidden underneath the introduction of the series is a fantastic anime that makes it more than the typical shounen. \r\nArt: 9\r\nIt doesn't look like your typicalanime art, though that doesn't mean it isn't good. The character design is average; the backgrounds are beautiful, and the way it's overall drawn is pretty nice. And in the last six episodes especially, the colors play a unique feat. The fighting scenes are nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 \\n\\n\r\nThe music and overall soundtrack of Rakudai is fantastic. The opening is very catchy and won't leave you disappointed. I should add in that most of the character's voice actors voices really fit their characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9,5\\n\\n\r\nBoth the male and female lead, Ikki Kurogane and Stella Vermilion, are both nice characters. They both trained very hard to get to where they are today, and neither of them are dense. They might be annoying in the beginning, but both of them get character development over the series, making them lovable characters. \\n\\n\r\nThere's some other characters as well, like Ikki's sister, Shizuku, who can be very, very annoying in the beginning of the series but becomes an enjoyable one, and Ikki's friend, Alice, is mostly there to give him support throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI loved a lot of things about it; the amazing choreographed fight scenes, the lovely soundtrack, the extremely cute romance. I don't have too much to say as to why I liked this anime, but I just know that I was anticipating for the next episode every week as it aired.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe anime starts as a very standard idea, but I can see that the show tries to differentiate from the rest of the pack without losing the charm. The characters are fun to watch and the romance is great much less a little different from the usual romance. For romance fans, it is established very quickly, far more quickly than normal and develops well over the course of the series.\\n",

It is a well-balanced anime with great action and decent romance. you don't need to expect anything you just have to sit back,relax,grab some snacks and enjoy the show as things unfold.\r\nStory 8/10 - nothing you haven't seen yet BUT the good thing is that it has a nice flow. story is very light but some parts will tickle you a bit right in the feels. Also a good thing is that it is not trying too hard to be great of a show.But it is surely made to entertain and that's what it did. If you're into something deep and dark this show is not for you so  just better get the fcuk out.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 - animation is good for most of its parts. You will surely love the fight scenes as it is done smoothly and it has nice choreography. Every major fight is astonishing giving it a high score for visual entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 - OP is good. ED is shi* but i bet nobody gives a crap as long as the show is good. : ))\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10 - Both the MCs are likable and both having a fluid character development. What is great about them is that they have no time for nonsense especially in combat situations. Always ready to deliver the asswhoopin'. :)) Some minor characters are annoying but only in a little way doing nothing to ruin the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 - I totally enjoyed the show. The formula maybe simple and cliched yet it is very effective in providing full entertainment and that is what we came here for. The show may be short for 12 episodes but it will leave you with a feeling of satisfaction.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 -  I highly recommend this show to everyone especially if you're into Action-Romance. I've been waiting so long for this kind of show where it goes straight forward leaving viewers satisfied. No dragging and overly dramatic part. Yes there is fanservice and it is good because it's shown at the right moment. Finishing my statement this show may not be epic but it's great! and  for fcuk's sake you will surely find it worthwhile and engaging.. : ))",

We definitely don't have enough of the \"irregular, oblivious, harem-hoarding\" protagonists out there who are participating in magic schools.\r\nClich\u00e9'st of the clich\u00e9s. (Yes, I'm aware that it is not a word.)\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThe story was mediocre, to say the least; I normally don't really mind these sort of anime, if the story is at least intriguing \u2014 OH BUT WAIT. Another one of those anime with an overpowered protagonists who have a mundane, tragic backstory to them that isn't elaborated much further except solely concentrating on the fact that it was, well, tragic. The story is medium-paced, which I think theanime is doing a good job of, but that's one thing that I can really think on top of my head right now.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nEh. That's all I can say. It's not bad, it's not terribly eye-catching either, the colors are used to its truest colors, and each of the characters aren't weirdly distorted or disfigured in anyway, which is always pleasant. The shading of the hair seemed lazily done at first (just gradient filled) but in the end, the color palettes soothingly match the whole arch. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nTypical, which I don't mind \u2014 it has the bass, guitar, all that exciting stuff. But it isn't one of those anime where you would enthusiastically search up the OST for and listen on repeat. But all the soundtracks fit what's occurring in the anime well and enhances the overall experience, which is all I could ask for.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nI mean, this is touched upon in the story part of this review, but the main character doesn't have much interesting aspects to him, let's be honest. He's one of those shounen main characters that you see quite often. The pink haired girl is also just an assertive tsundere, which is cute to have. But then there's the sister! WHEW. Borderline\u00a0\u2014 I mean, completely incesty. Yikes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI could see how people could enjoy it, but I would personally like my anime to go into depth about all of the components that's been listed above already. I think it could have gone in a completely new direction with the MC's ability to copy the opponent's move, but it's disappointing that it's gone in that previously paved direction again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOkay. That's all. I rambled too much.",

            "content": "After reading the synopsis, you might be thinking this is yet another magic-school fantasy centered around an overpowered male lead. You're not wrong. You also might be imagining a relatively shallow and overused plot and...you're probably right on that account too. But if you think Kurogane Ikki is the oblivious one dimensional protagonist you're used to seeing, you're dead wrong.\r\nRakudai Kishi no Cavalry is easily one of this season's best productions and a wonderfully refreshing addition to the harem genre. Scratch that. This isn't a harem, but it certainly feels like one for the first few episodes. Does this mean we finally have a protagonistwho has the balls to choose a girl??? Indeed he does and early on in the show too. As a consequence, we as anime viewers actually get the rare opportunity to see how a relationship progresses beyond the confession stage. Imagine that. \\n\\n\r\nHere, the romance between Ikki and Stella definitely deserves much praise. The writers and producers did a great job fleshing them out as characters and paced their relationship appropriately. Like any couple, they have real arguments and issues which they talk over. The producers don't even shy away from the blatantly obvious sexual tension that is often dismissed in ecchi shows . Instead, these sexual issues are actually confronted in some of the conversations that Ikki and Stella share, making them more like a real couple. \\n\\n\r\nThus, I found the show's strongest point to be its characters and their relationships. I'm not just referring to the romance between the leads but also to the relationships between all the characters. You feel as though you understand where these characters are coming from and why they are fighting so desperately to win. They aren't doing it just to prove that they're strong. \\n\\n\r\nIkki certainly doesn't. He fights to prove a greater message - that hard work can match or even exceed natural talent. Easily the show's most likable character, Ikki only seems \"overpowered\" because he gives every fight his 100% and trust me, he doesn't win by whipping out a new ultra-powerful technique for every fight. This makes him less like a character and more like a person - someone you can stand behind and root for because you know he's trying his very best to match his opponents. \\n\\n\r\nBy the way,  this show has some of the best action sequences I've seen in recent years. They're thrilling and have a tendency to keep you on the edge of your seat because the action is incredibly fast paced. Instead of standing around and conversing, most of the dialogue occurs within the character's minds during a fight. In other words, we witness how they're analyzing the battle as they're constantly moving. If that isn't impressive enough, Kotaro Nakagawa's incredible score will definitely keep your heart pumping through them. \\n\\n\r\nStill, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry isn't without its flaws. Like I said, the plot isn't anything new and basically identical to that of another magic-school anime this season, The War of Asterisk. Furthermore, I felt as though Stella started off as a strong female lead who was unnecessarily developed into a more feminine one as the show went on. The ending leaves many things unanswered but I can't complain because it follows the source material exactly and we can only hope for a second season. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is worth a watch for anyone who wants to have a good time. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes romance, magic-sword fights, and the occasional dose of fan-service. For those of you who are turned off by the show's generic plot, watch until episode 4 and give the character development a chance to hook you. Don't let the synopsis fool you because Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is definitely not \"The Worst One\" in its genre.",

            "content": "Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is one of the most mixed experiences I've ever had in regards to anime and manga. Nothing about it is particularly great, in fact, I'd argue that most of its traits place it below average. Hell, the only reason I started the series was because I saw the opening on YouTube and thought it would be some kind of badass, gritty Western with samurai cowboys (The opening had a twangy, catchy tune and there were swords and the word \"cavalry\" was in the title. Don't judge me.)  Yet, I found myself enjoying the show greatly,despite the fact that it pretty much sucks. Is this one of those mythical \"guilty pleasures\" I've heard about? The answer is no, this anime won its favor with me on its own merits, but I don't think I would ever be able to reccomend this show to anyone looking for a good anime.\\n\r\n     Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry's main claim to fame is its romance. If you ask any fan of the show why you should watch it, they'll tell you \"Its not a harem anime, its an actual romance!\" and that will be it. I'm going to be brutally honest here, the romance of RKnC sucks, but those people do have a point. The chemistry between the leads (Ikki and Stella) is noteworthy, and there are some really realistic and sweet scenes between the two (\"Why are we arguing?\" \"I don't know!\"), but one of the key aspects of a good romance is actually having good characters. The characters in Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry are garbage. As a result of the characters being awful, the romance really doesn't hold any weight and can't technically be called good. That being said,  the dialogue between Stella and Ikki is very enjoyable and is definitely the best thing this anime has going for it.\\n\r\n    When I said that the characters were awful, I wasn't joking. Seriously, the leads consist of Ikki (Cliche harem protagonist who's saving grace is the fact that he isn't in a harem. He's also really overpowered despite being built up as weakling who sucks at magic.) and Stella (Starts out as nothing more than a tsunedere bitch, but loses those tsunedere qualities by the halfway point of the show. After aformentioned halfway point, she essentially has no standout character qualities to speak of. Tsunedere bitch > no standout qualities.). What's really sad is that the cast of side characters are all just as generic and, in some cases, outright disgusting. Shizuku, Ikki's little sister, is a white haired loli who wants to fuck her big bro. Classy. What's worse is that the anime tries to explain this disgusting behaviour through this big, tragic backstory of how she always looked up to her brother and just wanted to help him with his problems. The only thing worse than pedophilia is self-hating pedophilia that tries to justify its own perversion. Embrace the fuckery, damnit! Oh, and theres also a tranny named Alice who's somewhat of a sassy gay(?) mentor figure to Shizuku and others. Out of all the side characters in the series, the only one that I really liked was the final villain, Todo. She was this badass chick who was also really likeable and charismatic. On top of that, there writer(s) goes out the way to place parallels between Toda and Ikki. I honestly felt like she would have made a better protagonist than Ikki.\\n\r\n    The plot is awful as well. Threats are hyped up (student council is an example of this) and then totally disregarded. There's also this big subplot at the end of the series involving a hearing that doesn't make any sense whatsoever (Why the hell did Ikki go to the hearing and let himself be tortured? He literally did nothing wrong and had no reason, psychological or legal, to go. Kissing a rich, talented girl is not illegal last time I checked. So contrived.).\\n\r\n     So why do I like this series? Like I said, the romantic dialogue was good and realistic and Todo was beastly. Also, while the romantic plot is bad and the characters suck, the romance progresses at a pace that is pleasing, fulfilling, and unique. Also, the soundtrack (particularly dat opening) was fairly good. \\n\r\n     All in all, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is a shitty series with some really fun aspects. I wouldn't reccomend it to anybody other than an experience fan of LN adaptations.\\n\r\nThis is Horatio_Nelson, signing out.",

Story (up), I've given it a 5, since its plot and setting  was the same as another anime namely \" Gakusen Toshi Asterisk,\" but let cut there, since this isn't the portion for that,........however, in this anime they focus more on the suffering of the male MC where he was treated like shit by his family. But as I've watchthis anime up it's 11th episode, understanding why was he treated like shit by his family is pretty much unclear, let's not forget, his otosan actually recognizes his abilities and knew that he is a force to be dealt with, but why treat him like that, which is another reason why I can't give thsi anime's story category a higher score. Art (up) ok so there were a lot of fanservice  in it particularly when it comes to the panty shot, but unlike other harem based anime with ecchi, here the fanservices were a bit moderate, so it still a \"GOOD.\" Sound, I gave it a 6 cu'z I jaz don't have a lot to say about it, I have no fuss about the VA's who did the character's voices, I just can't stand both the opening and closing theme. Character (up) the score was meant for Ikki whom at first was treated like shit both at home and at school, basically he's situation was like Cinderella, when Stella arrives she basically becomes his inspiration and his source of strength, that has provided this anime such sympathy for the guy, but I can't ignore this anime's double standard on Alice, usually guys aren't  allowed in the ladies shower room , one might wonder as to why he is an exception, also it was rather ambiguous Alice Nagi is a he or a she, enjoyment (up) so far I only enjoy watching this anime to a certain extent as to simply want it to get over with, thought the fanservice did provide some spice,it probably  wouldn't be enough for them pervers to ponder on it, so overall,  this anime may have a harem genre, but it can't be classified as a true harem since the only competition for Ikki's affection was between Stella and Shizuku, and if Alice is a guy , it's kinda unfortunate that he can't have a piece of the harem pie, so basically this anime basically has such \"POOR\" taste when it comes to treating the MC like shit, frankly this anime basically relies a lot on Ikki's struggle to battle such misfortune. So season 2 anybody??????Don't even think about it, jaz leave it as a manga.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nPEACE ESSSE and Merry Christmas!              \\n",

This is simply my take on it and as always you are open to your own opinion. \r\nI'm basically writing this review only to say that this is a DIRECT rip-off of Gakusen Toshi Asterisk. Maybe I am incorrect as I have no idea which light novel  was released before the other therefore I don't know whose story is the rip off.\r\nBut, I CAN say they are nearly identical and one is lower budget (this one, obviously.) \r\nThe female lead are both princesses from another country ata school for some reason or another and both have magical powers involving fire. The male protagonist is under-ranked and expected to be an easy fight in both anime but ends up being more powerful in other ways and both use a sword. They are both underestimated in strength due to different but very similar reasons in idea. \\n\r\nThe only difference I am seeing is this is very much definitely Ecchi while the other is not.\\n\r\nOh, the music isn't even comparable, by the way. Asterisk's music and audio blows this anime's music and audio out of the water. Art is also not comparable.\\n\r\nPerhaps this anime would be enjoyable to someone who hasn't already watched Asterisk, but not me. This is getting my two thumbs down.",

As for me, it got me hooked at the first battle, that was great battle action. Here's my review:\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nI'll mention it's flaw first, it has some pacing issues, especially if we talk about relationship or romance between MC and the princess. it's not that bad though, I rarely find good romance in this kind of genre, some might even find the conclusion satisfactory(I won't spoil anything here). The main story itself is not half-bad, the tale of\"the worst one\" is pretty intriguing.Although the plot almost overshadowed by the ecchi scene here and there, but it gets better and more serious(in good way) towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nI like most of them, the female pair (the princess and imouto) make good comedy duo. but the most interesting one is the MC, he's cool and skilled, also he has some nice background story and development. some enemies and rivals are pretty decent, too bad we can't see much of their action.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI'm no expert when it comes to art in anime, but I'll say the battles animation are really great. each character has unique style and performed well in battle.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nI don't remember anything memorable, except that dude song in the opening is really lame\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nWell, I enjoy almost the entire show (especially the battles) and actually hoping for more, too bad no indication or confirmation for 2nd season\\n",

            "content": "Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is certainly one of the biggest surprises of 2015. For me, who never expects much from anime adaptations of magic school battle harem light novels, it completely caught me off guard since i went with little to no expectations at all and still was pleasantly surprised by how good Rakudai Kishi turned out to be. \r\nUnlike many other series of the same genre, Rakudai had the good fortune to receive a proper, non rushed adaptation that only covered 3 volumes of the source material. Unsurprisingly, the pacing never felt off and the original story wasn't butchered. It just felt right.\r\nAnd talkabout a strong ending! I think this show improved immensely since episode 1 and now that it is finally over, it certainly makes you eager for more. I love how it so confidently managed to free itself from the usual LN battle harem formula and tired LN routines and actually ended up developing an identity of its own with some really likable main characters and some nice stylistic (director worked at Shaft with Shinbo) and artful visuals and top notch animation quality in pretty much every important fight. \\n\r\nAnd not just that: the romance is super refreshing and surpringly charming and mature for the genre since the two main kids are seriously likable and their interactions are genuinely honest and entertaining, so their chemistry is undeniable. The amount of progression in their relationship and how natural and healthy it feels in only just 12 episodes would put most romantic comedies to shame. \\n\r\nAs for the story and setting, it is hardly original but still fairly entertaining. Since it mostly revolves around a battle tournament, it relies on the fight's quality and on the strenght of its characters and the interactions between them a lot more than other LN series, which would rather focus on overly complicated settings and boring worldbuilding with an unecessarily large scope and obnoxious technical slang, endless harem members and bland self-insert main characters that no one really cares about. \\n\r\nLuckily, Rakudai managed to overcome all these genre barriers and tropes, and that is why it stands so much in such a stale environment, clogged up with repeated ideas and lack of originality.\\n\\n\r\nSo should you watch Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry? Definitely.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, and as far as LN adaptations go, this is undoubtedly a pretty good one and the original source is definitely way above average, so even though it starts fairly generic and it takes some time to get to the good stuff, you should definitely give it a try because you will probably enjoy it, even if it won't blow your mind. Moreover, there is also a very unusual sense of closure you don't often find in these sort of anime, which makes the whole thing even more satisfying while still leaving you eager for a second season.",

            "content": "Cliches in anime are something are commonly used for the sole purpose of pushing along the plot using an easy and well known way.  Things like the token meeting of the tsundere, the general overpoweredness of our main character, etc.  And so, we have \"A Tale of the Worst One\", a show that does a rather decent job at not following the herd.  (And that is a good thing.)\r\nStory: Kurogane Ikki is known as the \"Worst One\", a noble knight (aka a person who wields a magical blade) who is Ranked F.  A student that is so bad that he hadto be held back for a year and is considered as the worst student in the entire school since he performs simply the worst.  (They really bully in the fact that he's the worst.)  One day however, he, by the laws of anime, is roomed up with the new student, an A-class rank who is also a princess, might I add, named Stella Vermillion, and sees her undressing, ladadadada (we've been over this in several hundred other series'), then...says that he'll strip so she doesn't feel like the only one embarrassed in the room.  Huh.  Well that's a new one.  \\n\\n\r\nIn essence, Rakudai Kishi is a show that follows your traditional tournament anime format.  The goal of the series is for Ikki, our main protagonist, that he is not the worst one, and does so by entering the national noble knights tournament, the \"Seven Star Battle Festival\", an even where each school sends in six students to participate; Ikki spends the entire show pretty much vying for one of these spots.  For the most part, that's our show.  But that's not what makes Rakudai better as a series.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes this show is the fact that it doesn't fully rely on average tropes in order to make up episode to episode.  The most notable example of this is the romance that goes on in this show.  Romance in anime is generally either rushed to the point it makes no sense, or so dreadfully slow that you'd die before they even think about the thought of them being a couple.  Rakudai not only makes its main couple a definite fact, but it builds upon that.  Not as smoothly as it could've might I add, but it's not done in a way that feels completely out of place, and I like that.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd so, with all of that being said, what is there wrong with the story if there're so many good things about it?  Well, my dear readers, one word can fully answer all of your questions.  Pacing.  (Pacing seems to be Silver Link's issue this season, as all of its shows have this kind of problem.)  Rakudai Kishi is a series that has a relatively good chunk of explanation or text behind it in order to explain how our protagonist does things in battle; that is not an anime's best friend.  Because of this, a lot of the technical parts of the show essentially get ousted to the point that what is happening on screen doesn't make sense, or at the very least, complete sense.  Not only that, but some rather important fights as well as some other key parts of the series aren't animated so there's a little bit of a disjointedness that they never really cover up.  Some parts don't go together as well as they should've, and that's the biggest shame of this adaptaion.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the story of Rakudai Kishi is solid, as we not only get one that breaks a couple trope breaking, but also one that has some decent storytelling.  However, because of the show's tendency to rush, it wasn't as great as I would've hoped and is honestly a bit of a disappointment seeing as how the other forms of the story are well received.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Decent story\\n\r\n+  Trope breaking scenes\\n\r\n-  Pacing issues create a whole host of other problems like missing story, rushed and/or missing explanations, and loss of key parts.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Similar to its story, the cast for Rakudai Kishi does a fairly good job at breaking those lovely...lovely character tropes that we all know and love...  (I mean, everyone just loves a good tsundere, right?  ...Right?)  \\n\\n\r\nUp first, we have Kurogane Ikki, the Worst One, as we're repeatedly reminded throughout the entire show without end.  (Seriously though, we get it.)  Even with all of this repeated abuse, Ikki remains as a strong and determined person who chooses actions rather than words, spending the entire series trying to prove to everyone that he's not the worst one by showing everyone his battle prowess and his ability to defeat enemies regardless of his limited abilities, which really shows a lot about his character.  He's a more relatable character that I feel makes the show better.  But, because of all of the shortcuts Silver Link took, we don't really get the full story.  \\n\\n\r\nThen we have his partner, Stella Vermillion, the crown princess of the Vermillion kingdom, and the supposed 'token tsundere' of the series.  As the main female protagonist, Stella is the character that spends most of her time with Ikki and becomes closer to him as a result.  With this, we get a more natural progression (albeit a little rough due to the pacing) of a relationship between the two that eventually equates to something more and something that feels more genuine since the relationship between the two intertwines with the series.  Stella, like Ikki, feels more real as a character, but because of the lack of certain points, doesn't come out as well as she should've.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for other characters, we have Ikki's brocon imouto, Shizuku, her roommate Alice who is a guy who basically identifies as a female (not that there's anything wrong with that), Ikki's various opponents throughout the shows (some of which DON'T GET SHOWN!  ):<  ), the anemic teacher, the principal, etc.  For the most part, most of these characters serve as plot progression or help to explain what is going on, save for Shizuku and Alice who bear more importance to plot as they are main characters that add a lot more to the story.  Not as much as they should've, but they do.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good main characters and development\\n\r\n-  Side characters don't really have much importance to them\\n\r\n-  Pacing affected the impact of some characters and their importance\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for Rakudai Kishi is something of an interesting thing to tackle.  For the most part, the show is done in this light color palette that is rather standard in terms of quality.  Its fight scenes are rather fluidly done and they look nice, but there really isn't much to say because it's not fantastical in any way except for a few choice scenes.\\n\\n\r\nParticularly in the OP and the second to last episode, Rakudai employs a black and white scheme reminiscent of old gangster films in a vintage filter that actually looked rather cool.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Cool Vintage style  (Even if only for one episode)\\n\r\n+/-  Relatively average artstyle.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack for Rakudai Kishi is peculiar, to put it mildly.  The OP, known as \"Identity\" is a very fast-paced and action heavy music that has an oddly Spanish feel to it?  (Iunno.  It sounds a bit like Flamenco to me.)  It's a good OP, but for me, it doesn't really fit the series or the themes that Rakudai is trying to express.  Same for the ED, but the ED just sounds melancholy and uninteresting.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good OP\\n\r\n-  Kind of meh ED\\n\r\n-  The music doesn't fit with the show\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  Rakudai Kishi is one of the shows that I was excited for in the Fall 2015 season.  I read the manga and heard good things about the original LN, and I was hopeful of this adaptation that would come.  But in the end, we got something that was more based-on rather than adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this series?\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, I still did liked this adaptation.  Forgetting all of the flaws, it was something that still was the series in a nutshell, focusing all of the more important parts of the series and not really the specifics.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about the series?\\n\\n\r\nMostly, what angers me is the fact that the lack of proper pacing and explanation really brought the series down.  There's a lot of detail that is just absent and as a result, a lot of things felt a little disjointed and to a new viewer, could be confusing.  This might not seem like a big issue, but the written formats of this series are vastly different both in story and character to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you do know what happens in Rakudai, I would not recommend watching because they are missing a lot of things and some important fights/details are missing so...it might not be as enjoyable.  (I know I was upset when the cat girl didn't get her time in the spotlight.)  But if you haven't, then give it a shot.  It's a good series, but personally, I would say that this adaptation doesn't do it the justice that it deserves.",

            "content": "Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry starts with a typical harem-y school battle setting, making it rather similar to the other school battle anime airing this season; Gakusen Toshi Asterisk.\r\nThe theme and setting of this anime is rather generic and has been seen since quite a long time ago. In my opinion, this anime is rather 'shonen-y' with quite a bit of harem elements. However, the battle scenes are what made me hooked to watch the anime until the last episode.\r\nThe characters in Rakudai are pretty much stereotypical archetypes; a 'weakest guy', a red-haired tsundere girl, and a clingy little sister. However, as typical the characters canget, the relationships between the characters, especially between the two main protagonists, are rather interesting, delving into depths which are quite uncommon in this kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is certainly not one of the most lavishly drawn and animated, yet there is a certain sort of beauty in the artwork. Soundtrack isn't a focal point in this anime, but I do find the OP and ED quite pleasant to hear.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Rakudai is a proof that not all things generic are bad. As much as I saw lots of overused and tired elements in the story, the execution of the plot is indeed what makes this anime shine to me, making this anime enjoyable to watch.",

            "content": "As someone who has watched many, many school battle harems over the years, I have started to grow dull to this type of show. At first I liked them, but as I kept watching the same recipe, the same characters, the same stories over and over again, I noticed that my enthusiasm to watch these anime started to fade.\r\nYet, in hope of finding one that would defy my low expectations, I kept watching every single one of them.\r\nRakudai Kishi no Cavalry seemed like one of these typical full-of-clich\u00e9s shows. Just seeing the cover, I noticed the unoriginal lead girl in the front with red hairand twin-tails. Now I don't know if it fills an actual fetish but I have seen more red-hair twin-tails girls that I can remember and just from that I could already guess that she was going to be a tsundere as well. I was not mistaken. \\n\\n\r\nSo I embarked on this 12-episodes journey that Tale of The Worst One was. \\n\\n\r\nThe story started off with one of these overused clich\u00e9 scenes where the male lead walks into a room and sees the female lead changing clothes. As to not spoil what happens next, I will keep quiet about what the male lead does. But what I can tell you is that the development of this scene actually pleased me.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning of the shows does provide its audience with several clich\u00e9s. But the way these are handled is usually different from other harem shows and one cannot help but feel refreshed at how the anime tries to make fun of these overused situations by breaking free of them in an unusual manner. For me, this was a big positive point.\\n\\n\r\nNow although I would like to be as generous with the overall plot, I unfortunately have to admit that it's as generic as it can get in a magical/sci-fi school setting. There is a big tournament and our main characters have to take part into it for various reasons. It's already been done tons of times and will probably be done again in the future. It's uncreative but that's what the show's main audience enjoys so this setting is milked to the maximum.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is something similar to many other shows and so is the overall development of the story. This would have been a deal breaker for me if not for... its romantic sub-plot. This is probably the first time I ever witnessed a romantic sub-plot save a show with a sci-fi school battle setting. This is because this kind of genre is usually linked to the harem tag. And this is where this anime diverges: this is not a harem but it is indeed a romance. \\n\\n\r\nAnd you might think \"But Trumpcard, how does this change anything ?\". A very good question but the difference is actually very important. As much as the main tournament plot is relatively uninteresting, the development of the relationships between the characters is given so much importance and screen time that it makes you care for the characters much more than in any other generic show with generic characters. The way the anime invests time into building emotions helps fleshing out the characters of the show instead of leaving them as walking clich\u00e9s: this is the main difference between Rakudai and other harem shows and in my opinion, this alone helps improving the story's score from a 4/10 to an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto my favourite section: the characters. \\n\\n\r\nI do say this is my favourite section but as mentioned before, the characters start off as being devoid of their own personality. Take the main girl, Stella Vermillion. From the beginning, she is introduced as a red-haired tsundere princess with twin-tails who happens to be extremely powerful. This type of character is so common in anime that I could barely see the difference between her and just about any other harem female lead. \\n\\n\r\nIkki, the main character, is the same. He is a common boy considered as the weakest one. His character design is rather bland with him having brown hair and eyes - your typical Japanese kid, one might say, which makes it easier for the Japanese audience to project themselves onto him. But just understanding WHY he's designed that way doesn't mean that I enjoy that character design myself. \\n\\n\r\nAs you may have understood by now, the characters - at least at the beginning - have nothing going for them. But something that is especially surprising coming from a 12-episodes anime is that these characters actually do have some character development. Of course, this is not on the same level as something you could expect from a 24-episodes anime but it is still an achievement to turn characters that are so bland and dull into ones we actually care about by the end of the story.\\n\\n\r\nWell although I did say that, that only applies to the main characters though. Don't expect the side ones to have any kind of meaningful backstory or character growth (especially the villains / antagonists). \\n\\n\r\nSo to sum up, yet again I would have given the characters a very low score but the meaningful growth they go through in these 12 episodes makes me want to give it a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the art & animation. As someone who is rather picky about the artwork, this can literally be a deciding factor for me as to whether or not to watch a show. To keep it short, the artwork used in Rakudai is something that is very pleasing yet unusual. It reminded me a lot of the one used in No Game No Life, which I also happened to enjoy. If anything, I would put it up there in my list of best artworks used in anime.\\n\r\nThe artistic direction used in the OP and the last couple of episodes was very creative and fitting. The use of monochrome scenes coupled with one other single colour helped outlining the emotions conveyed through the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was also actually pretty good. After visiting Reddit, I found out that people were claiming that the animation of Asterisk Wars was better than the one used in Rakudai. To these people, allow me to laugh for a few seconds before carrying on with this review.\\n\\n\r\nHa, ha, ha.\\n\\n\r\nThere we go. Just so you know, overusing badly timed CG doesn't make for a good animation, people. I don't want to talk too much about another anime in this review so I won't go into comparisons but let me just say that gorgeous artwork coupled with very fluid battle animations and decent normal-scenes animation makes up for something that is a feast for the eyes. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was there. It's nothing to write pages about. It was enjoyable yet barely noticeable and didn't really leave an impact on me but at least it wasn't something that destroyed the mood whenever it was inserted. I found the ED rather common but fitting and the OP... well that's either a love or hate. I personally loved it and sang along when it played out but I can see why people would dislike that kind of music. Well, to me any OP that I don't skip every episode is a success and I never skipped this one so I guess it did its job. Thus this section is awarded an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might have guessed by now from the tone of this review, I started Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry with the expectations of being disappointed by another generic show. And while it is true that this show could be much better if a little more time was invested into a better plot, I actually found myself to be eagerly awaiting for the release of a new episode every week - something that did not happen with Asterisk Wars. When a show makes me wait like that every week, I can't help but award it the maximum enjoyment score: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nIt also made me want to read the light novel and the manga, again something Asterisk Wars completely failed to do. The only other complain about this anime I have at this point is that Asterisk Wars has been confirmed to get a second season while this one has not. I guess people in Japan have different tastes than people in MAL. Gotta blame it on A-1 Picture's mainstream popularity.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, Tale of the Worst One is a show that I would recommend to anyone who's bored of the same old recycled formula in terms of high-school battle shows but still keeps watching them every season... wait a minute. In fact, if you're one of these people you're probably going to watch the show anyway so why do I bother. \\n\r\nIf on the other hand you're someone looking for a meaningful plot then this is probably not for you. But if you still want to give it a go, you might find yourself to be actually enjoying this, just like I did. \\n\\n\r\nThus my overall score for this anime is 8/10. Not because it's very original but because despite having an overused setting with overused characters, it tried its best to deliver something new and enjoyable rather than milking the cash cow. So I praise the effort.\\n\\n\r\nSuck it Reddit, this was better than Asterisk Wars.",

            "content": "No spoilers :P\r\nSo during the season in which this anime, \"Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry\", aired, there was an absurdly similar show that aired at the same time, \"Asterisk Wars\". I watched an episode of each one and was hooked into \"Asterisk Wars\" first, being I that I fell for its soft pastel colors. All things told, \"Asterisk Wars\" was a disappointment; but that is a discussion for another day.\r\n\"Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry\" starts off as an average ecchi-school-battle-royal-harem, but unlike many, *cough, \"Asterisk Wars\", it is not a harem and has a well executed conclusion. The pacing made sense, and played in character arcs. Theatmospheres starts off being carefree and casually flips around to become more dramatic as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nArt was fine. Nothing over the top. The color pallet used is pretty much the colors you see in the cover art. Character designs were typical. I personally find \"Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry's\" character designs more attractive than that of \"Asterisk Wars\" of the same season. \\n\\n\r\nEcchi elements... lets just say... ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) *Red twin-tails tsundere + ZR\\n\\n\r\nCharacters play a large role on the enjoyment department in my book and in \"Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry\", I don't think they disappoint. The characters have motives and change over time based on what they've been through. I might be giving this too much credit since some scenes and character interactions seem pretty cliched but for this anime genre/formula, it is often expected.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP/ED were mediocre for me, I just skipped it.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say I didn't enjoy it, (notice I started with a negative) but being that this anime still falls to the typical \"unoriginal ecchi-battle-school\" genre, I had to crank up my expectations. There are many shows of this genre making it difficult for \"Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry\" to stand out. Is it the best out of this genre? Certainly not, but it can be close up there. It definitely tells the ecchi-battle-school story effectively, which makes it worth a peek ;)\\n\\n\r\nI give a solid 7/10; good but negligible for that season.",

I think because it has a good understanding of what works about that setting. It mostly emphasizes the fights and the goofy character dynamics, until the end when it takes a bit of an ill-advised visit to the drama zone.\r\nThe characters have very exaggerated personalities, but I do find some of them likable. Ikki and Alice are pretty good characters, I'd say. Admittedly it's hit and miss; Stella and Shizuku are rather annoying. Although the former has decent interactions with Ikki at least. It's probably for thebest that this anime focuses on just that relationship and dials the harem aspect back compared to usual.\\n\\n\r\nThe most unqualified strength this has is the fight scenes, which are very good. Detailed, well animated and fun to watch. They do a good job showing how the various characters' powers play off each other, and it's nice how Ikki wins his fights by observing and outsmarting his opponents. Sometimes the fight scenes take up entire episodes, and that's honestly when the show is at its best.\\n\\n\r\nBut you can't give it too many props for the story and characters.

            "content": "Nothing about this show screams originality, its quite cliche and the show knows its roots and try to add few twist to the common trope of having an established romance ( somewhat okay execution ). But unlike the show that came out in the same time Asterisk this is several times much better and by far more intriguing and have much more likeable characters and having amazing set pieces like the 1 second ( no spoilers just hint). Is it a great show nah not really quite generic and some crutch as dialogue is it insulting bad nah, it was good enough for the audienceto invest in what's going on.  If your bored and u ran out of decent or good animes to yeah why not you'll be entertained for 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nPros= characters ( just not the red head), the designs are actually well done, voice acting majority of the time is good, animation, director undertakes this sense of media and knowing how to construct momentum in an action set piece having a sense of rhythm making it flow wonderfully NOT HAVE BILLION CUTS but sometimes having 1 long cut. \\n\\n\r\nCons- The World itself is by far uninteresting and boring, External environment designs are plainly average, magic is done in the most generic way, some character personalities are way too tsundere for its own good, I think the second last episode had such a tonal shift that kinda makes sense but still felt out of place compared to the rest of the show. Not like HxH twists dark but just really randomly and tonally awkward.  The last point like I Said it's not original it tries to add twist but at times that fails.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- if u looking for a main protagonist u wanna root for and cool action with some heart I think it's a show worth picking up but no need to rush watching it especially compared to other great shows in its genre but if u interested you'll have fun with it.\\n\\n\r\nI don't like scores but if someone wanted to know what I give it I think tbh like 6.45 but in my anime list I rate 7 because scores here is really biased.",

            "content": "Probably, as you are looking through the reviews of this anime, you are considering, wherever you should watch it, or not. A tl;dr answer from me would be \"yes, its actually pretty good, watch it\".\r\nAnd now I will elaborate on my opinion.\r\nIt would be most beneficial to start with the story, for which I gave 4/10: that`s a light novel adaptation, my man, no one comes for these shows for the story! Now, it doesnt mean its a bad show, of course not. It just simply means the story is practically non-existent. Just a rather recycled, mediocre story, not necessary bad, but nothing new.\r\nI willskip now other areas, and talk about characters (I will come back for the other things tho). Its a fair 5.5/10, as, again, thats a light novel adaptation, dont expect intriguing characters with amazing development. Now, again, that doesnt mean there is none of that. The protagonist is of some interest, some other characters do develop well. The only problem is that we all seen these characters quite a number of times in a hundred of different animes. Thats why I gave it a 5.5; its not as bad as a 5/10, but its not as good as 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nNow the praising parts: the art was generally really good, a low 8/10, only because most of the art potential went into the 11th episode and Ikkis fights, but oh my they were well made. Not going to spoil anything at all here, but the creators nailed the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nSound is just good, solid 6/10. Of all the different areas of criticism, I am most poor when writing about sound. It was just good, nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nNow, enjoyment. 7/10\\n\r\nI generally enjoyed the anime. There were a bunch of great things in it, especially the romance, it was surprisingly well made. The fights were pretty solid, the otherall premise was also good. Special mentions to ep8, which really did make this series a 7/10 for me. And the finale of the season is also worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, overall. At first, after I watched it, I actually wanted to give it a low 7 right away. There were lots of things, which really made this anime stand out from all the other light novel adaptations and generic shows. It was simply good. I do take some time, however, to reflect on the show, and thus later brought my grade down to a 6. This brought the same problem, which I had with characters. The anime is definitely better, than 6, but its hard to call it a 7. And so after a couple of months, I went back to it, and rewatched some moments from it. And, oh man, I did have quite some fun. Again, the episode 8 is great, it is just great, loved it. \\n\r\nAnd, thus, as I actually enjoyed coming back to it, I decided that this show does worth its 7. It was worth watching, and its not long at all, so if you got some free time, and wanna watch something slightly cliche, slightly not cliche at all, and something generally enjoyable, think of giving it a go. Though, its more like a 6.75/10, haha. \\n\\n\r\nApologies for slightly \"all over the place\" review, `tis but my first one.\\n",

            "content": "This is one of the best anime's I've seen, I can proudly say as an Otaku that the experience is there, not just fictional but truly worthy to be mentioned.\r\nFrom my perspective:\r\nWe had plot, well written, even though we had a few plot holes and cliches, the plot twists were beyond expectations, and the unconventional manner in which the protagonist managed to outwit, out-speak, outdo his competition made him a sure winner.\r\nOn the other side, we had Stella and the cast *the best friend, the sister, the airhead student council president and the gay/perverted friend\", by the way, did you noticed that all of theside cast had a personality and somewhat intuitive character awareness? The sister knew that her love was forbidden yet pursued it yet she knew how Ikki felt, and decided to drop out of the fight for him, instead of the usual pattern where the sister is the \"cock block\" who always gets in between the sweet moments just to have her chance at forbidden love.\\n\r\nThe best friend, wasn't just a comic relieve, instead he had wits, he filled the plot holes and he even added key elements to ensure the smooth completion of some key plot objectives. The airhead-clumsy type, in this case the student council president, we had a little preview of her power and a little cliche preview of her clumsiness in the \"panty-shot\", yet she remained true to her personality as a prideful knight.\\n\r\nWe have the \"group\" next, including the news cast/reporter girl, usually driven by plot twist and self sufficient into getting the scoop and ends up either pervy or in love with the protagonist, or a \"cock block\", or a \"fan service machine\" bent on creating fan based excitement. Instead, she realizes her value, even though she stays true to her nature, her value as a friend, as a support cast, meant to fullfil the role as a \"matchmaker\".\\n\r\nSo there we have it, we have a good story, yes a bit stereotypical at some points, but with interesting plot twists, we have the romance, and for once is noI give this anime a 10 out of 10.\\n\r\nHoping for season 2. \\n\r\nBest regards,t miss matched and they actually consume it, of course within reason, this is not a Hentai. And the anime \"Zetai makenai\" type, where he \"Zetai akiramenai ne\" aka never give up, fight and win.\\n\r\nOverall",

            "content": "At first glance Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry may seem like your typical harem/romance/ecchi anime that is pretty much all over the internet these days. I started watching this series as a 'guilty pleasure' sort of thing. \r\nPersonally, I'm a big fan of the light-hearted romance, comedy, ecchi, categories, but not a big fan of action/thriller/psychological types.\r\nRakudai Kishi no Cavalry is an anime that tries really hard to captivate the viewer, and in doing so, they've made it pretty confusing. Because this anime tries to throw backstories in randomly throughout the series in the most bizarre moments, plus their backstories are depressing, and are so cliche.\r\nThecharacters in this anime fit really well in certain archetypes. You can't exactly point to this character and say 'You belong in this archetype, and no other', but you can certainly tell which archetype is dominant in each character.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I have to mention that Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry does a fantastic job at building you up for the fights. I'm always on the edge of my seat before, and when those fight scenes actually come. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you're like me, and enjoy ecchi/harem/comedy anime, then this one is definitely for you. The ecchi-comedy aspect of this anime is surprisingly well done, as it doesn't fail to turn you on and make you laugh at the same time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe final episodes, namely 10-12 were rather confusing. I was 80% sure they were referencing some other show or anime with the sudden change in art style from bright colors to monochromatic tones, with a very 'dark' feel for the majority of the episode. Despite my confusion, I still enjoyed the final episodes, and I really, really, do hope that this anime comes back for a season 2!~",

            "content": "First of all, some people may be repelled by the fact that this show has an ecchi tag, however, this show is truly different from other cliche-ecchi animes. And i will tell you why.\r\nStory: 9/10.\r\nYou could even get some spoilers just from reading the description of the anime, however i won't spoil it.\r\nan F-rank blazer wants to join the Seven Stars tournament in order to prove for the whole world, and especially his family and father, that hard work could beat talent.\r\nStory revolves about him and the preliminary tournament, which you have to finish without any loses in order to get into the Seven Starstournament.\\n\\n\r\nThere are four characters which were mainly developed: Ikki Kurogane, Stella Vermillion, Shizuku Kurogane and Alice. There are some episodes which develop the characters, and some who are focused on the plot, for me the story was classic, yet still enjoyable, however something was missing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt style is truly eye-catching, the animation and fight scenes are well made. Character visuals are amazing, overall i really enjoyed watching this anime, visual-vise. It kind of reminded me of Fate series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThere are just few animes, which intro i don't skip and honestly this has become one of them. There is only one intro and outro, but both of them really have lyrics which are connected to the series. The songs used in the scenes are touching and well chosen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters got the lowest score of all the criteria, for one particular reason. There are some mysteries, which easily could be explained, yet they were chosen not to be dealt with. Vermillia's background could be further revealed, yet we only know that she is a princess. We don't know anything about Alice and his/hers past, so those are the things that are bugging me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nI truly loved these series. I finished them in 2 days, and i think that those are two days well spent. The ecchi parts aren't lewd, rather hilarious and add some comedic taste to it. Some issues, which are usually annoyingly dealt with in other animes, are cleared up instantly, and this without doubt, makes your irration go away. For example when MC and his lover have issues, instead of them running around circles just irrating each other, they sit down and talk it out, resolving them instantly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like school anime, tournaments or sword battles, i truly recommend this anime to you fellow reader.",

            "content": "I don't usually write reviews, but when I do, its because an anime deserves a review because it was good.\r\nPersonally I thought this anime was a great 12 episode series. It had a little bit of everything that I like from action, to romance, to ecchi even. Only thing it lacked (for me personally) was some good ol' nudity, of which there is close to none. \r\nStory:\r\nFrom the get-go it looks like your generic action/harem/ecchi series, but it grows out of it quickly. The story itself is probably the weakest part of the anime, but it services the characters quite well. Its a genericstory that works in bringing together fantasy, romance, and action into a futuristic school setting. Once you settle into the rhythm of the anime around the 3rd or 4th episode you realize that it's not a harem story and you fervently hope he picks the best girl (which is immediately clear from the beginning, but after watching about a million harems with dense MCs who don't pick any girl... you get the idea). So the overarching story here about the MC winning tournaments in a school setting is more or less there just to hold this entire piece together, since the main plot gets pretty predictable after the first couple of episodes, and you basically already know what is going to happen in each fight. Personally its the subplots that bring this story beyond your generic anime. Best subplots are MC v his own father and MC with Best Girl (yes i'm trying hard not to do spoilers). So overall a generic story brings together multiple elements in a well balanced story that also happens to be fresh after watching too many harem animes. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nSince it is a newer anime (2015), drawing is crisp, animation is fluid. Its pretty hard to tell that it was a 2015 anime when compared to newer animes in 2017. The Art also does well to emphasize the plot, which is the first time I've seen it happen. Using a black-white color scheme to emphasize MC's abilities, the contrast of Blue and Red in the final 2 episodes, and also use of light and shadow really impressed me when I saw it. Only thing i would complain about is that all the characters seem to wear eye shadow regardless of (perceived) gender. Possibly usage as a shadowing technique? I dont know personally I've never been a professional artist by any means so it could just be a technique i haven't encountered before.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIn anime, the sound is good. quality is clear, adds to the art and story itself, and is quite well matched for the setting and the action. Voice actors are on point, especially for Alice with the blending of general male/female properties. However, Opening song was in my opinion badly casted. The male voice for the song threw me off, and personally did not enjoy his voice as it sounded raspy and uninspiring. The end song i didn't even listen to because the start of the song sounded like screechy horror music. Coupled with some red background while thorns on a vine creeped across my screen, no thanks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAh the best part. One of the biggest things for me is THE MC ISN'T A BLOCKHEAD AND CHOOSES THE BEST GIRL AT THE END OF THE SERIES!! I have seen too many idiot MCs who build a harem instead. On the topic of the MC, he is great. generic storyline of how a weak person turns into a strong hero, but this one has his limits. He also gets a good dosage of character development and happens to overcome the mental limits of his family. Best girl is meh, mostly just cute face with nice tits, but still not too bad. She does flip pretty quick in the first episode from haughty princess to naughty princess, but it was enjoyable. She's definitely a tsun in the beginning but also gets that dosage of character development and finds the guts (notice i didn't say balls which is what i would have said) to reveal her feelings to the MC. There is a gay character but it wasn't overplayed so not too bad and was a good supporting character/counselor-type. Then theres the crazy MC's sister who actually loves him but gets no character development and so is easily the weakest character of them all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nLike you may have already seen, this anime blends quite a few categories together, and is quite good at it. None of the parts were overwhelmingly covering the others, but all built into the story quite well. That made this anime enjoyable for me. In addition to it putting together genres that i personally enjoy, it had a good ending with a resolution and piqued my interest in season 2 (WHICH IS COMING FALL 2017 i heard/read).\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n10/10 for the full package. Honestly did not think it was that bad, although the lack of nudity was sad. I'd say something along the lines of 3 for story + 3 for characters +2 for art +2 for ecchi equals 10 overall  \\n\\n\r\npeace",

But the problem with ikki is that he is ranked the weakest student at the school because of his low abilities when it comes to the magic and other things with him having the degrading nick name \"the worst one\" and basically treated like shit be most people around him.\\n\r\nSo after returning from his daily training  who comes across a half naked girl named Stella vermillion who is a princess from a different country Who came here to study.\\n\r\nSo after trying to talk to the headmaster of the school \\n\r\nThe to of them decide to have   a dual in order to sort things out where the looser is the winner slave for life.\\n\r\nWhich ends in the usual way with the main character completely beating her.\\n\r\nWhile she is recovering from her fight she learns that her and ikki have a lot more in common than she  first believed.\\n\r\nBecause she has also had a similar experience to what ikki has gone though but from the completely opposite side.\\n\r\nand so begins there adventure of working together in order to rech there dreams.\\n\\n\r\nWhich can be helped by entering the seven start sword art festival which is a inter school  tournament which is student fighting  each other between other schools.\\n\r\nWhich is done by the strongest students of each school. Which is also decided by a tournament of some sort.\\n\\n\r\nSo the story is basically ikki and Stella fighting there way to the top of there school In order to get to this torment with them fighting opposition of the week \\n\r\nand the  usual shit in between.\\n\r\n for example they fight some sort of terrorist group in one ep and in another part is where there basically doing regular school activities  and some sort of romance that's going down.\\n\r\nWhich sounds pretty bare bones. \\n\\n\r\nBut as you continue watching you start to  notice.\\n\r\nthat  not what it's all about.\\n\r\nIt is actually about an under dog story done right  about the Main character and few others characters  as they try to slowly change the system around them for the better.\\n\r\nAs they try to point out the flaws and hypocrisy of the system around them.  \\n\r\nBecause in this society if you have low magic power your basically trash and people with high magic power can kind of do what they want.\\n\r\nFor an example of this we find out that ikki is part of a prestigious clan of magic knights. Who after finding out ikki condition basically ignore is existence and continue to try and stop him from becoming a magical knight and even when ikki left his home and managed to get into this school in order to become a magic knight  by the skin of his teeth. \\n\r\nStill unable to take part in classes because the kurogane clan basically got the school head master at the time to change the rules so he won't Be Able to past his classes.\\n\r\nAnd for a whole year he was basically in a no win situation at his school.\\n\r\nBut though strong will and  determination he continued  to try and get stronger.\\n\r\nBut now an opportunity has presented its self.\\n\r\nWith the new headmaster that has told ikki that in order for him to become a magical knight and reach his dreams he must win the seven star sword festival for his school.\\n\r\nAnd that is basically what the story is about.\\n\r\nWhich is quite interesting because I never expected something with actual deepth in a light novel anime.\\n\r\nBasically this is a story that subverts all expectations  when it comes   to the generic light novel type story's.\\n\\n\r\nNow it nothing ground braking.\\n\r\nBut at the end of the day it kind of refreshing in a way that they decided to take it.\\n\r\nEspecially with the writing.\\n\r\nBecause it has a sort of self awareness to it.\\n\r\nWhich doesn't mean that's it good because it self awareness because it doesn't do much with it. But it has a sense of charm to.\\n\\n\r\nFor example there is this one scene where ikki is telling Stella that is Little sister is going to be at school and she sied to him your not going to tell me that you guys aren't related by blood or something like that with him reply no we are related by blood and  then she says ok that's fine.\\n\r\nWith that scene there basically saying yes we know what type of series this.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that makes the story stand out from the norm.\\n\r\nIs the fact that there is an romance that actually goes some where for a change.\\n\r\nBecause it nice to see the moan character pick a girl and stick with it.\\n\r\nPlus they take seriously enough for you to by into it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character ikki actually has some sort of personality.\\n\r\nBut what Made him stand out for me for example was his determination to continue fighting against a system that for most of his life pretty much backed him into a corner. Because he didn't have much magical abilities.\\n\r\nLike his  personally is pretty much this.\\n\r\nHe is pretty much a  calm and collected guys that is very noble at heart. \\n\r\nAnother thing that also stands out from him is that we are also showing that there things that  will get to him. \\n\r\nFor example there is this one scene where he is so nervous about this fight with this one guy.\\n\r\nBecause of an encounter with this person  in the past that really made him really struggle at first with his big fight with him at first intil they managed to up him get back into his normal state of mind.\\n\\n\r\nStella also has some sort of personality as well.\\n\r\nAt first she seems like a basic tsudare character type.\\n\r\nBut like ikki there is more the Meets the eye with her and I am not saying she deep or anything like that.  Because she isn't.\\n\r\nBut she a pretty interesting  back story which is quite relateble and her dynamic with ikki more than makes up for it.\\n\r\nAlso she never felt like the carbon copy of what a tsudare is. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic on there dynamic they have very close blond which eventually becomes love which at times a little rushed but very genuine. \\n\r\nAnother thing which made there romance interesting as the fact that out of the both of them she is the more sexually promiscuous.\\n\r\nwhich is something you don't see that often because generally it the male partner that is more of the pervert.\\n\r\nFor an example. There is this one scene where they are in a log cabin in the woods and they are basically resting inside and both of them are basically half naked well you know hormones and the mood being set she asks ikki if he wants to have sex with her. Of course he turns it down because he is more of a traditionalist when it comes to matters of a sexual nature while Stella is not.\\n\r\nWhich was quite interesting.\\n\\n\r\nNow I am going to go more in depth about to more characters because I believe that these to especially at the moment of doing this review need to be addressed.\\n\\n\r\nSo i am going to talk about is ikki little sister first.\\n\r\nShizuku who has a massive  brother complex.\\n\r\nI know some of you are oh my god here we go again.\\n\r\nBut unlike some shows that do this kind of trope mostly for comedy or fan serive in my experience. Which it kind of is but that's beside the point. \\n\r\nThere is an actual good reason why she is like that. \\n\r\nBecause she was probably one of the few members of ikki family that didn't treat him like shit. And when she found out about what her family members where doing to him she basically hates her family minus for brother and decides  that she will become the subtitle    for the love that he never received from his family. And has no problem show casing  this is because I. One scene where it's the first time she had meet ikki in about 4 years she pushes him to the ground and kisses him in front of a large group  of people and talks about her feels to her brother.\\n\r\nEven though it kind of shallow they at lest have some sort of context to why she is like that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother character I want to talk about in a bit of detail is Alice.\\n\r\nWho is basically a transgender or transsexual person (and don't quote me on this because I get confused on which on is which because I don't really care and plus I kind of forget the difference between trans- sexual and trans- gender people)\\n\r\nAnd in most cases of anime  I have seen with these kinds of character they are generally used as some sort of joke which when I think about it is kind of insulting\\n\r\nTo people who are like that and to the character them selfs.\\n\r\nBecause they could have been interesting if taking seriously enough.\\n\r\nBut Alice on the other hand is actually taken seriously for the most part which was also somethings I didn't expect from this kind of story.\\n\r\nAnd for the most he was quite the interesting character to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for the side characters that  where for the most pretty average for the most part\\n\r\nMost of them are pretty one note.\\n\r\nSome of them where a bit more interesting than other that.\\n\r\nNothing else really noteworthy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation  was very well done.\\n\r\nAll the back ground also like very nice.\\n\r\nThey also have a very bright colors scheme.\\n\r\nWhich actually changes when there some serious shit going down.\\n\r\nBecause when characters are feeling depressed or there a lot of tension in the scene.\\n\r\nThe world becomes red , black, gray and sometimes there some blue in there to.\\n\r\nThey also like to use expressive animation when the come to what the characters are generally feeling.\\n\r\nThere is also some very good fight choreography.\\n\\n\r\nIt has a very generic style to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are basically your run of the mill light novel  designs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe quite enjoyed listening to bouts the opening song and ending song.\\n\\n\r\nBecause it kind of got my attention and it has a nice beat to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe ost was on point most of the time but nothing really standing out that much.\\n\\n\r\nBut I think that the op and end song are worth a quick listen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 6/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo when it came to this anime what I enjoyed.\\n\r\nIs that it took the basic light novel formula and put actual effort Into it.\\n\r\nAnd it was refreshing and quite endearing.\\n\r\nEven though it had quite a few generic shit that kinds of bothered me it actually never felt like that. I also found this to be a good time passer as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSo if your are new to anime or just starting to dive into more titles then check this show out because it's a  very good entry level show.\\n\\n\r\nBut if your a veteran of anime or you think light novels  is the cancer of anime then probably stay away.\\n",

Some \"action-ecchi\" anime are bad, but\r\nyou would love this one. There are time for ecchi scenes and action scenes.\r\n[WARNING : There is one scene here that will blow your mind! NO GOOD FOR KIDS!]\r\nThe anime contains cliche scenes but who cares?\r\nThis anime is about the guy and the girl who fights together to reachtheir dream. \\n\r\nThere are no monsters in here, just humans with powers.\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime have different superpowers. You will know what are those if you watched this anime.\\n\\n\r\nPros : \\n\r\n+ Epic Battle Scenes!\\n\r\n+ FANSERVICE :)\\n\r\n+ Awesome background\\n\r\n+ Amazing animations\\n\r\n+ Entertaining sometimes\\n\r\n+ Quick RRRrrrromance\\n\\n\r\nCons :\\n\r\n- Last fighting scene was rush.\\n\r\n- Not Original Story\\n\r\n- complex story\\n\\n\r\n*Original story - no cliche/or copyrighted story\\n\r\nOverall, I still like the anime.

            "content": "A main character who's underestimated but still really overpowered in a magical high-school setting? Count me in.\r\nThough obviously very basic, the story is somewhat enjoyable and I personally have a sweet spot for overpowered main characters, especially if they're underestimated all the time. I know it's not really interesting or revolutionary, but I seem to enjoy it time and time again.\r\nThe art and sound are good, and pair pretty well with the anime. Especially the fight scenes are really well animated, and that makes them one of the highlights of the show.\r\nMy enjoyment overall was somewhat hindered by the forced ecchi, I know it's subjective,it's just something that feels really weird to me, and in this anime especially, it felt extremely forced sometimes. It just had nothing to do with the plot at all, not that ecchi normally improves the plot in any way.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy the premise this anime sets, and you enjoy some good action scenes, you should definitely try this one. If ecchi isn't your thing, I'd still recommend it, since the action is generally worth it. And if ecchi is your thing, well, you're in luck.",

            "content": "Rakudai Kishi no cavalry does may things right and is superior to the almost identical gakusen toshi asterisk.I dont write reviews often but i felt like reviewing this due to the unnecessary flack its getting for being similar to shows like asterisk and mahouka and basically all highschool tournament underdog shows.\r\nFirst thing that sets cavalry apart is its romance its unique because the relationship actually goes somewhere, theres kissing and affection through the whole show although it could have been implemented alot better but at least its not like other shows that have an extremely dense MC, it stays fairly realistic being both dont haverelationship experience but still wanting to advance closer and at times feeling a bit rushed.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is above average and is fairly colorful, i actually enjoy the scenes where they had no colors except one highlighted that fits the mood of a setting.\\n\\n\r\nPlot is by far the worst about the show, it hints at conflict or backstory but doesnt give you enough to piece it together throwing villains at the MC for no other reason then \"Hey! im just a bad guy mwahaha!\".\\n\\n\r\nThe crucial thing the show needed was character development, only 2 characters got any and its the MC and some girl who was introduced in the later half of the show, it was poorly done but the problem is....what about vermillion? she gets some brief flashbacks of her sad after a battle and labeled a princess thats it!, shes the second most important character on the show!\\n\\n\r\nI found the music and sound to be below average.\\n\\n\r\nThe show good and has its glaring flaws but stays enjoyable and i would recommend it as a good show to watch if you have nothing better to watch.I hope this helped :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I will like to start by saying that this anime did a few things that i have never seen done through the anime i have seen. One being when something sexual happens it doesnt go to the \"whoops im sorry\" or \"your a pervert\" sense that i have seen lots of time. They took that concept with Ikki and Stella and did it the best way possible. I have respect for the animators and story writers for doing that which makes this anime that much better. Through out the anime i felt happy and connected with the characters and what they were dealing with throughout there time around each other. Nothing seemed repetitive or stall. The world was vibrate and interesting to watch. But i will take about each part and what i liked about each of them.\\n\\n\r\nFirst the story. I loved this story from the first every scene to the ending. Following Ikki become the knight his family never want him to be and watching Stella go from a know it all character to a very loving character in the end because of everyone around her was very good. Everything the characters did or what had happens in the past moves the story forward and doesnt feel like anything is filler. Everything happens for a reason and not because we want the plot to go forward. The battles to were very good with even story elements coming from them as well to get a better understand of what the characters have gone through to be where they are today. \\n\\n\r\nNext the art. The art of this anime is very colorful and the colors were very vibrant through out the anime. Each scene had the correct color pallet and tone to them to get a better understanding of how the characters are feeling or how the characters movements can be seen with the colors shown. The backgrounds are also something to not look away from. You can still see the characters and what there designs are like and still get a feel of the environment and how they are connecting the overall feel for each of the scenes and moments happening in front of your eyes. You look away for one moment on you might miss the beautiful art the comes across the screen.\\n\\n\r\nNext the sound. Each swing of a sword, each power being used, something hitting the characters or the ground, the music, every bit of sound you hear is connected to what is happening and is not sloppy at all. They get the sounds for combat just right and each movement either fast or slow has its sound with it and not missed. The music as well really helps with the overall tone as well. In the combat, in there rooms, even what happens in Episode 11 and 12. The sounds they use get you more connected to whats happening and what you think might happen next to keep you excited. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters. I have talked about the characters a lot already but this is where i can go all in with them. Ikki is a amazing protagonist and puts others before himself and still able to reach his goal of becoming a knight. He is someone you can connect to in one way shape or form to get better at something and not let others drag you down. Stella at first was a character no one would of liked, but as the anime went on she became more and more likable and would also help out the other characters with what they were doing while also focusing on what she wants to improve upon. Of course the other characters like Shizuku, Alice, and Ayase, all have character development as well and no one is left with just a boring personalty. Each one has something that makes them unique and different from everyone else which i do enjoy in an anime as well. Also the loving relationship that blossoms from Ikki and Stella is really good as well. \\n\\n\r\nFinally my enjoyment of the anime. Like i said i loved every minute of this anime and i would really wish to see a second season of it and see where they would go with the story and characters. Do somethings need to improve? Of course nothing is every perfect, but if i can have the same enjoyment from this show again with more story progression then i would be so happy to see that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall im very glad to have seen this because i really enjoyed watching this all the way through. If a second season ever does get made i will be so happy to be able to see more of everyone and everything from this world.",

            "content": "Warning:  Abnormal review ahead!\r\nSo picked this up thinking it was going to be another cookie-cutter, single season, harem/action/school show.  And sure enough it hit all my expectations - then smacked me upside the head with \"This is how it's done.\"\r\nAll the tropes, cliches, and whatnot's are there.  We have the swimsuit episode, we have the \"d...d....d...date?\" episode, the tsundere and the sibling complex.  The \"stare, stare, stare\", the \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\" moments each time a new harem member is introduced.\r\nSo yea, exactly what you'd expect.  But wait!  There's more!\r\nThe characters themselves throw caution tothe wind and tweak their roles just a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe Tsundere?  Yea she calms down pretty quick and figures out that she's being annoying (of course she forgets this lesson the next episode) and actually appologizes on occasion.\\n\\n\r\nThe Harem?  Yea it's one sided.  From episode 3 on, it's quit clear who the best girl is.  The MC treats all the other girls as a normal person would.  The 'Harem' tag really should be replaced with 'Romance'.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC?  When he inevitably sees the female protagonist in her underwear, instead of being a pansy and claiming he didn't see anything, he grows a pair and acknowledges that he saw, and he liked what he saw.  But he really is sorry for the invasion of privacy.\\n\\n\r\nMore MC?  Yea he's the kindhearted fool who goes out of his way to help people (specifically damsels in distress), but he does so with out the melodramatic whining seen in other MCs.  While he is OP, his OPness is actually explained and justified.\\n\\n\r\nRakudai Kishi no Cavalry takes the genre (harem/action/school) and makes it more realistic (as much as a shonen can be).  It's not going to win awards and accolades, especially as it came out at the same time as a similarly plotted anime, but it does things differently enough to warrant attention.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this show to anyone looking for a light hearted rom/com.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Right! Where to start? I've had mixed feelings about this show. Until this point (the time I write this review) it still hasn't been finished yet. That's because certain things are lacking while others are extremely annoying. But let's break it down, shall we?\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nI shouldn't really judge the story when I haven't seen the entire thing, but I'll be frank here: In the episodes so far, there hasn't been much going on. Of course, there was a goal mentioned but the characters have yet to achieve that goal. However, the entertainment values certainly makes up for it, keeping me as a viewer interested enoughto see through the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nNot the best I've seen but the fighting scenes in this action-packed anime are nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nSame as the Art category; it isn't good to the point I'll exemplify it but it isn't bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nWhile the main character is tolerable, I find myself wanting to violently murder every other character I've met; and interestingly enough practically all those characters are females with plenty of fanservice to go around. I'm not one for ecchi, but I already understood it was a packaged set when it came to any show with romance these days. However, the cringe-worthy voices and numerous angles of fanservice were simply too much. Yes, this was the turn-off for me; girls with no backbone. Not even the one female worthy of a ship could resist whining to the main character. The original score was a 1/10 but a few of the males were alright so a 3 it is. I'm being generous here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nTerrible characters aside, this anime is quite shallow and doesn't hold anything particularly special to make up for it. I managed three or four episodes before my expectations plummeted.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nAlrighty! So! If you want an anime whose dominant tags would be ECCHI, ROMANCE, HAREM, and ACTION then you can watch this one with low expectations...or just forget it. I don't know, perhaps you're someone all for that but for something that was personally suggested to me, I was quite disappointed. The only thing that would come out of this nicely was that the action wasn't bloody and, cringe-worthy as it was, the romance was at least apparent (as in, despite the harem the MC actually CHOOSES someone). However, don't get your hopes up; it was still one of the most awkward, forced romances out there.",

Once I heard \"Identity\" at the end of the first episode and watching the artistic intro for the series, I was hooked.\r\nI realize now that there are a lot of copy/paste adaptions like this one every season, I've seen a few and will probably watch more to get a better ideaof them, but I really enjoyed this one.  I'm sure everyone has there on reasons for liking / disliking these types of anime but here is why I thought it was good.\\n\\n\r\n1.  The intro music (battle music): I love \"Identity\" so got hooked right away and I got pumped with the music played in the background of a fight.  For me, If a series has a good music, I will give it a try.\\n\r\n2.   MC has eyes for only one girl and the relationship develops.  I've been watching to much harem anime lately so seeing an MC not being a wimp but also having some consideration for his partner was a nice change of pace.  I hope to find more MCs similar to this.\\n\r\n3.  The battles were interesting and intense. There were 2 battles that had a great stylistic effect that I wish was used more in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe only negatives for me were the little sister trope and some of the fan service.  Still, the positives outweighed the negatives for me and I would recommend.",

            "content": "This anime starts off strong, devolves into incomprehensible mess and then sorta recovers in the last episodes.\r\nI honestly thought that the first two episodes are amazing, because they had some sort of spark in them and displayed great chemistry between characters. Unfortunately, that chemistry quickly disappeared, and the series turned into a string of drawn out episodes full of melodramatic events, deus ex machinas, and overdramatizations.\r\nThe anime shares a lot of similarities with Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. The basic idea is the same - a very powerful underdog unjustly mistreated based on arbitrary ranking system. Heck, protagonists even look similar to each other, although Rettosei'smain character had less character and was much more powerful.  The anime also loves putting characters through pointlessly dramatic painful events for no reason, and those situations  feel forced. Sometimes characters just flat out act like idiots. However, with all that in mind, anime looks good, and art style is interesting to watch. The anime uses some sort of soft thin lines, which is slightly different from most of the titles I remember. Main Heroine despite being stereotypical tsundere (with all the blushing, getting upset over nothing, etc), is occasionally itneresting to watch purely from animation angle. Fights feature a lot of movement too... all that is overshadowed by shrotcomings and weak stories of the middle episodes, however.\\n\\n\r\nEither way, detailed breakdown is below:\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nStarts strong, gets bad, sorta recovers in the last episode to a tolerable levels. The story suffers from attempts pointless overdramatization, and even though it is supposed to be a one complete whole centered around the tournament, if you look back at it, it feels quite disjointed. Premise is quite similar to Mahouka Koukou no Rettosei, even though the world is not well thought out. There were plenty of situations where events feel forced or the story tries to go out of its way to put characters through some \"overly dramatic\" event (with onlookers badmouthing character in one frame, and then cheering them in the next), thankfully it does not go as far as Re: Zero went with its \"Almost torture porn\" episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nPleasant style which is a bit unusual. Thin lines, soft palette, although I think there were two semi-cg dragons I didn't quite like. OVerall it is of an above average quality, and looks greate after abominably bland backgrounds I've recently seen in High School DxD Born.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nDecent, but nothing I managed to remember. Complements the story, but doesn't get in your way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nInitial strong introduction made me thing there will be well-written interactions between characters with strong chemistry between them. Well, the anime happily proved me to be wrong. There are couple of amusing characters, but in general a lot of characters are inconsistent, and occasionally they act in not very smart or hard to believe fashion. Probably in order to cope with another ridiculous plot device. At the very least, their designs are interesting, and I enjoyed few brief scenes with \"Yuri-chan\". She was probably the best character in the whole anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nFirst two episodes were interesting, portion of the last episode was alright, the rest was quite bland.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt could've been better. Might be worth checking out to see the art style, and maybe first two episodes, and maybe the first scene with \"Yuri-chan\", but story-wise and character-wise the anime doesn't offer much - events are overly dramatic, overly melodramatic, characters often act in weird fashion, and as a result, the whole thing looks fairly hard to believe and disjointed.",

I saw it was ranked around 1000 and was popular so I gave it a shot but I have to say halfway through episode 1 I was ready to drop this turd sandwich of a show because it had nothing redeemable. The intro while mildly humorous was pretty unoriginal. Tsundere princess (literal princess in this case) seemed annoying and shit \"dont breath u pervert\" haha... However a decently animated fight made me think \"either they blew the budget on this 1fight or maybe it gets better\" thus I watched on. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 2 blood related sister introduced by walking up to MC and kissing him... \"our love is pure so why should being siblings matter?\" WTF IS THIS. I barely tolerate the 'not blood related' bs so COME THE FUCK ON! Again I wondered why I was torturing myself with an episode 3, especially because I haven't watched an ecchi show in something like...5 years. Episode 3 continued to be trash mall trip with predictable hostage cliche but... whoa that fight was.... actually really nice. And MC while bland could be worse.. watches on.\\n\\n\r\nAfter episode 3 the show just gets better and better with each episode. Nothing outstanding bar the DISGUSTINGLY nicely animated fights, like wow idk why they dropped the dosh on such a poorly written show but goddamn. Sister stops being a love rival and just is.... a sister who wants the best for her brother. And MC gets in a relationship with tsundere princess who actually starts having a somewhat normal personality. Whoa... \\n\\n\r\nIf you watch the show give it 4-5 episodes. If you can stomach the start and enjoy the fight scenes the show is fairly enjoyable and I found myself wanting a season 2 because I felt like the story would get better from where the show left off.",

The star of the show, Kurogane Ikki, is one of the knights but he has very bad magical skills that he is F-Ranked. This anime mainly focuses around our Kurogane Ikki, his development, and his efforts to rise from being the \"Worst One\". You may find the plot a bit clich\u00e9, but i think thing like that doesn't really matter as what matters the most is the execution and it is really well done.\r\nThisanime will not explore the concept of magic knights to far and instead will show lots of Ikki's struggles and his views. His trouble with his past and how he has grown to his ideals.\\n\\n\r\nThe action in this anime very is very engaging and colourful, it keeps me excited throughout the scene. I loved watching Ikki fighting, it's fun to see how he thinks and acts.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the opening for this anime, but not so much for ending. The ending just feels weird with how they start the music.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a very good anime showing very good action and the protagonist's development. This anime might start typical but it is executed very very well and keeps me entertained the whole duration. This anime will not be a harem and focus more on romance.\\n",

            "content": "SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST 5-8 MINUTES OF EP1. \r\nThe story starts by introducing Blazers AKA Magic users and ranks them based on their magical ability. The MC, Kurogane Ikki a \"talentless\" F-Rank student opens the story by giving a backdrop of his life as a talentless boy and how he ran away from home because he was ignored because of his state.\r\nWhat turns from a relatively generic and acceptable opening is soon complimented by a comedic ecchi / service scene. Naturally openings like these are funny and captivate the audience.\r\n\"The Worst One\" nicknamed Ikki, will challenge \"The Best One\", Stella, for what originally was room-ground-rulecontrol, that became total control over the other person's life of servitude.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating : 4\\n\r\nOST: 7\\n\r\nArt: 8 -> 6 as the show goes on the quality goes down, until the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC is LITERALLY a carbon copy of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei's Shiba Tatsuya. A seemingly useless mage on pen and paper with extraordinary physical fighting skills that outweigh all other things on the surface. \\n\\n\r\nOddly enough his \"only\" skill, Blade Steal enables him to have outstanding analytical skill EXACTLY the same way as Mahouka's Tatsuya is able to read movement and predict enemy habits with incredible accuracy.\\n\\n\r\nHis biological sister, who has strong romantic feelings for her brother ALSO USES ICE MAGIC AS WELL.  \\n\\n\r\nBUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!\\n\\n\r\nIkki, JUST like Tatsuya is considered useless and without purpose(although Tatsuya was a body-guard/weapon instead), Ikki his considered nothing to his family while his sister is talented beyond belief.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many glaring similarities to Mahouka's plot-line it just makes it worse that the story takes the exact same road where it tries to redeem the strength of the MC, even though that is not what he's trying to prove to everyone, but his father alone.(Mahouka's MC has no care for anyone or anything but his sister, and aspires to be an engineer to improve the world instead)\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all this, the show throws in copious amounts of service/ecchi that is completely unneeded almost constantly.\\n\\n\r\nI watched this start to finish hoping it would get better, and it didn't. The antagonists of the show try to make Ikki look worthless, and it obviously, fails to do so.\\n\\n\r\nThe final fight however was great. Not gonna even try to break it down. It's not your typical fight, but the way the fight \"evolves\" start to finish was pretty amazing.\\n\\n\r\nI will not be continuing this series if another season comes out. The show was a train-wreck that ended on a decent fight. I'd like to leave it at that. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're here for a shitty carbon copy plot of Mahouka with a ton of unneeded service and a never-evolving plot-line, and an incredibly shitty romance that escalates faster than the speed of sound, this is the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf not, don't bother with this.",

Not saying its the best, it has flaws such as those stated above and it doesn't really give much backstory either.\r\nWho knew such a simple story would have a deeper meaning..

            "content": "I started Rakudai as soon as the season started without great expectations, knowing there can be no miracles with highschool, ecchi, harem animes.\r\nWith that in mind I watched 6 episodes as soon as they aired and then I got bored, but having a tiny bit of hope I somehow managed to finish it.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nStory isn't that new, it has some sudden changes and a bit of unnecesary fillers in such a short anime, but it-s easy to understand. It has no plot holes in the story itself, but if this show don't get a second season giving it a finale after all it went through,there will be an awkward feeling.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nStrong, strong point. Characters and settings are well designed, battle scenes (except, of course, one shot battles) are quite entertaining and well designed; magic effects are luminous and it does not abuse a single tone of colors. Having such a nice art makes watching RKnC easier.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nExcept for the MC, every other single voice was in its place, helped with the personalities of the characters. I didn't find the BGM memorable, but it wasn't bad and was well placed. The Opening is specially good and the Ending is good enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nNothing we haven't seen, they have their personalities, but no one brings anything really new to the table. The MC has something different from the standard Harem Lead, but it doesn't help a lot. The characters work better as a whole than as individuals, they actually complement each other, but their personalities are so standard it's hard to forget about that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nNot so hard to watch, but if you're a bit tired of the excesive fan service, it's not a good idea. Without the fanservice, maybe it could have gotten a couple extra points, because it's excesive and sometines out of place. Personally don't think anyone will remember RKnC in a couple years if the anime don't get an awesome sequel.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nAlmost bearable, it's an average series with a good art and sound department. It has it's moments, but they don't save the whole thing. It could have been worse, of course, but it also could have been A LOT better. It has potential, something a lot of Magic Highschool Harems don't.",

SImply fantastic, i would easily rate them 9(even tho i rate the anime as 8)the music during the battles and the songs are beautifull.\r\nI would like to compare it withanother anime of the season even if they are different.With shakurako-san that started insanely interesting with beautifull graphics but ended up dull with messed up plot and a big hole. Rakudai on the other hand u think its your average harem anime, but it turns to be 10 times more. Fantastic plot proggresion, fantastic fights, fantastic soundtracks, yes the plot itself is not nuclear science we have seen it again but delievers great and progressives even better.\\n\\n\r\nAt the very end of anime it let u a feeling of completition and enjoyment of a very good anime u just watched,  and not the average harem fun aspect between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nA very very welll made anime and everyone should watch it",

            "content": "Hopefully this review helps some people, but it is my first attempt at one so not really sure if it will. Anyway, I have read quite a few reviews where people analyze the art and sound and stuff which is always cool, but I am not a big connoisseur of these things, so I will only touch on them briefly. I will go through the usual breakdown of each category with my own at the end where I will talk about how the anime is with respect to its main genres.\r\nOverview:\r\nI freakin' loved this anime. I texted my friend after the last episode explaining thatI could not stop ejaculating after completing the series (not really, obviously) because it was just...that...good. I am a huge fan romance anime. They are always my go-to and having action with it is a huge bonus. As someone who can not STAND when anime beat around the bush and drag shit out, especially romantically, this anime is absolutely perfect for me. Now you may be asking why not give it a 10/10 then, well just shut the fuck up and read I will get to that, or just skip to the bottom because that is where I will talk about it. Anyway let's get into the nitty-gritty stuff:\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10):\\n\r\nI personally loved the story of this anime. It was only meant to be 12 episodes so obviously you can not expect much, but I was legitimately interested in the story when there was one. The main character (Ikki, as Stella so kawaii-y calls him) has a life problem and the determination to solve it, great, love it. Short, sweet, simple, good stuff. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\nLike I said I am not a big artsy-fartsy guy. I like most art styles, from \"Bakemonogatari\", to \"katanagatari\", to \"ping pong the animation\". This art style was good old-fashioned anime art. It was crisp enough to make the ecchi parts outstanding so it had to be good...right?\\n\\n\r\nSound(8/10):\\n\r\nListen...the way I see it if I don't notice the soundtrack then it means it's blended so well into the mood of the moment that it does not stand out, which is what happened with this anime. I would give it a higher grade but that Engrish in the opening ruined a perfectly good song in my opinion. Can't stand Engrish (most of the time).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10, easiest decision of my life):\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning I loved Ikki and Stella. How could you not just fall in love with them after their first encounter (do not want to give away anything, but it is hilarious and amazing)? Stella is an amazing counterpart to Ikki. She is pretty sexual on the outside but a bit shy and reserved on the inside, worried what Kurogane (Ikki's last name) might think of her. Kurogane seems reserved and focused on the outside (which he is), but is actually pretty much a teenage horn-dog at heart. Even the side characters are great. Alice is mysterious and just genuinely intriguing, Shizuku (please let that be her name I was way too focused on Stella in this series) turned out to be a fuckin' bad ass and just an overall cool person. Then there's the perpetually-vomiting professor, the caring-but-stern father, really it was one of the few anime in recent history that I have seen that did not have a single character that just annoyed the shit out of me. The development is pretty fast-paced but not in a way that seems rushed, just overall the characters are awesome, that's all you need to know. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nI'm at half-chub just writing this review, god damn this anime is so good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10):\\n\r\nI do not give out 10s so easily, so here is my breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nFor the purpose of reviews I want to be methodical, so let's analyze each of the main genres: Romance, Ecchi, Action.\\n\\n\r\nRomance:\\n\r\nIt is rare that a 12-episode anime has a fantastic romantic aspect like this one. There was no fuckin' around (in more way than one), they just got straight to the point, right out of the gate. Both Stella and Kurogane knew what they wanted and were not coy about it. I personally have gotten sick of the suspense built up in romance anime, cheers to Rakudai Kishi for breaking the trend. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\r\nComposition: 60% (meaning I believe the anime is 60% romance)\\n\\n\r\nAction:\\n\r\nFor all of the romance in the anime I almost forgot that it is also technically an action anime. Some of the action scenes were rather lacking but there were also some scenes that I still talk about with my friends weeks after the episode it appeared in, they are that bad-ass. Can't ask for everything in such a short season, so the action clearly to a backseat to the romance, which I love, but it did hamper the action aspect for those of you not as into romance as I am.\\n\\n\r\nScore: (8/10)\\n\r\nComposition: 30%\\n\\n\r\nEcchi:\\n\r\nSurprisingly there was not a ton of ecchi in this anime. Personally, I am not a huge fan of overly-echhi anime. You know the ones, where at one point you just go \"oh come on that's just excessive! There should not be tits in this scene! I'm not gonna complain but still, come on!\" I was also a huge fan that the ecchi scenes stuck to one character, Stella. It made sense, it was rewarding, and there was not too much of it. The balance was great, and that is the key to a good ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nScore: (9/10)\\n\r\nComposition: 10%\\n\\n\r\nNow to calculate the overall score.\\n\r\n10(.6)+8(.3)+9(.1)\\n\r\n=9.3/10\\n\\n\r\nI can not bring myself to round up from a 9.3, so I had to round down.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, overall score: 9.3/10\\n\\n\r\nSeriously if this gets another season I will weep. Hope you enjoyed my first review, stay classy everyone!",

            "content": "In the pursuit of killing boredom and fulling a rather interesting self-pledge to watch all (Y2k+) rom-coms out there, I bumped into this one evening when deciding to pick out my list for the Fall 2015. This was a pleasant surprise. Having the marks of cliche all over it, I still used the \"3 shows and your out rule\". Getting over all of the unpleasant rom-com/harem cliches the first episode, this series proved to be a gem. Lets get into it...\r\nStory (7)\r\nAs far as stories go, this is a needle in a needle stack. Having the male MC turn out to be the \"worst\"in a school for  because he has no \"talent\" (at least the talent the school grades on). The romance subplot complements the action story well, a rare find these days, and to top it off, it does not end like 99% of the rom-com/harems out there. I may imply that cliches are a bad thing, but only if they are done in the most boring way possible. This story presents all of the story elements we are use to, in a new package, with new paint, making it seem like a different toy altogether. I can safely praise the use of well known story elements for they have been used in their best form.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9)\\n\r\nProbably the strongest element in Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry. The fight scenes were very well animated, the characters were distinguishable from more than just their hair styles and colors, and each character had their appearance match their personality in a mostly non stereotypical way. Since this ties into the character element as well, just got to say, well done Silver Link and Nexus.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6)\\n\r\nNot very memorable but did not pull from the show. Nothing really stands out, good or bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8)\\n\r\nIn my opinion the art and character elements played very nicely with each other in this series. The characters behaved and acted how you expected, while giving very nice surprises here and there, just like real people. The interactions between the characters were well thought out, as each seems to have an impact later in the series. Most of the \"main\" supporting roles had good screentime to flesh out their motivation or enhance their flair. The biggest disappointment for me would be the lack of background for Stella, but with 12 episodes and a promising feel for a second season, it does not pose too much issue.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9) \\n\r\nOverall I thoroughly enjoyed this series. It filled the \"week to week gotta see this when it comes on\" feeling that Overlord left in its wake. Since series tend to give off a different vibe when you marathon it, I will post an update on that after the Winter Season to ensure that the hype from it died down and I forgot at least some of the inner workings of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nDisclaimer *All of the prior message has been thought on spot and was not reviewed before submitting. This reflects my opinion based on the forced weekly watching and is subjugated to change.*",

            "content": "Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is no way a special or a Masterpiece. This anime is definitely an interesting one when it comes to my overall enjoyment. I have watched eight episodes so far and I can see the development is good and still ahead.\r\nStory : 6 - The story is fairly intresting and each episodes make me want to watch the next episode so i'd say it has a good story development.But it is safe to say that the story is nothing new. Atleast it isn't treading any new light with its battle academy story. Of all the animes watched I can think of threeanimes namely Absolute Duo,Freezing and Infinite Stratos which has a similiar story and development. And this season (Fall 2015) an another similiar anime 'Gakusen Toshi no Asterisk' have been airing as well. That said, it is a generic story because it is generally a well-received story that is a simple setup for the rest of the show. It's an average action-fantasy RomCom on the surface, but it sows great interaction and romance between the MC and the femaile characters. The story is very straight it doesn't try to go for details and looks more into story deevelopment. SO I'd say Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry ha outgrown in some ways from its predecessors. \\n\\n\r\nArt : 9 - One of the great points of the show. The art is very good , but is by no means perfect. Character designs and colouring while greatly generic, are done well enough to make them eye catching and loveable. the background and scenery is breathtaking and very appealing.The fight was animated beautifully and the sword play is awesome. Honestly, I can't think of a more fitting art style for Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry than the current art. So I thank Silver Link for the great work.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8 - One of the factors I love the show. It is really good. The OP song catches you immediately and pulls you into the fun adventure you're about to go on for the next 20 minutes. The soundtrack throughout the show is very well adapted for what's going on visually, from the quirky tracks during the moments of levity, to the epic and hopeful tracks during the well-choreographed action, to the light string and piano compositions during the touching romantic moments. The sound team really did a top-notch job on this show. It's a pleasure to listen to. But I can't say much for the ED, it is really out of the place it makes me want to ask if they could'nt find a better choice than it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 7 - As I mentioned before the characters are very generic and common. Specially what caught my i eye was the amount of red-headed tsunderes that pervades the animes lately. However, I do give my credit to Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry for tweaking the situation and story a bit to make the characters a bit differrent from the usual. I also like how Ikki complared to other MC is a bit mature and confident in some ways. Stella as well breaks the current standard trope of tsundere and goes for a a good , kind and dere than the standard tsun. Also , the story contains the cases in which mutual respect that becomes the romantic feelings, which I feel is missing from anime romances lately. The romance especially in this show is very, very well done and heart-warming beyond anything I've seen in a little while. Hopefully it stays that way for the rest of the season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9 - As much as I enjoy the show I can't give the show more than 9.. But the main reason is because there are a lot of shortcomings about this show. Hopefully the good points overshadow those points so I have decided to give it a 9. The characters are fun to watch , the ecchi is tolerable and okay and the art is very good. So far, it has been a very satisfying and enjoyable show so far and not to mention the a liitle kind of romance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8 - After thinking on th very points stated above I decided to give the anime an Overall - (8). The anime starts as a very standard idea =, but I can see that the show tries to differentiate from the rest of the pack without losing the charm. The characters are fun to watch and the romance is great much less a little different from the usual romance. Th sound is just great and welldone. I'd say for those who loves fan-service ,this anime is for you. And for those who hates it, this is not the anime for you. So far the animes have been full of laughs and fun and the show has began to get better after the first 4 episodes, so there is much to see.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure most viewers will find something about the show to enjoy.\\n",

This is the thought of many people who watch it, Yes i agree it all starts by a boy entering a girls room or something similar like that and then the girl gets mad and a fight occurs, and then they become the best of the best partners. \r\nNow coming onto the review, I don't write long reviews because not many people like to read them. \r\nThe anime story line is quite straight forward until the last  2 episodes (Sorry im not releasing any spoilers) and i must say that thestory line has been written in a way that would give you the opportunity to be curious about what would happen next, will he or she win! that's the thought that would be running through our minds. \\n\\n\r\nThe designs of the anime characters are quite good, nothing to be impressive of, it has similar designs to that of the high quality animes released within the years 2012 - 2013, the environment designs are very well made and the foilage textures are very well designed as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound dubbing has also been done quite appropriately, the creators of the anime has thought really well on deciding the voices of all the characters, if the voicing is horrible then the anime tends to fail miserably, but in this it is done in a really good way, i have no problems on it\\n\\n\r\nThe character personality's are something to be considered as well, the MC (Main Character) is a regular high school guy who is a Rank - F in the ranking section (Reminds me of the anime ) and then a girl who later on becomes really good friends with the MC and the MC's sister and the MC's sisters room mate, these are the main and sub characters that mostly appear in the anime and there personality's are of a top notch design. \\n\\n\r\nOverall i give it a base 8/10 score because of the main reason that it is similar to a lot of anime's that i had watched, but i recommend people to watch it if they like Magical powers and of course ECCHI!!!!! (The anime is filled with those, Kids make sure to not watch it in front of your parents) \\n\\n\r\nRecommend Quality Watch:- 720P or 1080P\\n\r\nEncoder/Subber:- Horrible Subs",

            "content": "A little late to the party here, but better late than never I guess.\r\nWhen looking at seasonal charts to decide what anime I want to watch, it's easy to look at something like Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry and say \"oh fuck, another shitty light novel harem ecchi battle series\" and pass over it entirely. And granted, that's exactly what I did. It's easy to lose faith in light novel adaptations with the abundance of rather below average ones cropping up nearly every season. However, it really isn't right to judge a book by it's cover, so I gave Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry a chance finallyto see if the bad reputation of it's brethren follows suit. \\n\\n\r\nI've seen a few reviews praise this show for twisting around some of the tropes that normally follow this kind of show, especially with reference to the characters. And while I believe that there are some notable changes to these that warrant praise, they aren't much more than additions rather than total changes. It's building off the base of these tired old tropes like the underdog, the tsundere, the ice cold loli, etc. and adding new things to them, sure, but they aren't changed enough to tell them distinctly apart from their foundations. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I wrote this review at 2:00 in the morning, so I inevitably didn't really explain my major point very well (that being the characters still being basic tropes with some fairly superficial additions), so I'll explain it in more detail by using the main character as an example. The most well known trait of generic light novel main characters are that they are obscenely overpowered (see Kirito from SAO, the MC from Mahouka, etc.) and don't face much of a challenge from anything. Ikki Kurogane is a little different, getting some worthwhile adversaries that do end up giving him a hard time for every fight. However, it doesn't change the fact that he is still insanely overpowered and wins fights against the strongest characters presented in the series, sometimes based on sheer willpower. While this character fits well with the general message that the anime is trying to portray (i.e. sheer talent doesn't get you anywhere without a little hardwork), it doesn't change the tropes around enough for him to be a standout main character in his own right.\\n\\n\r\nI'll get the absolute worst part about this show out of the way. The world-building is pretty awful. A lot of these terms are thrown around to suggest a bigger picture, but so many things are never explained in full enough detail to actually make any sense. For example, the main character, Ikki Kurogane, wants to show that his lack of magical talent is made up by his intense physical and mental capabilities by becoming a Magic Knight. The thing is, we have no idea what a Magic Knight actually does. This doesn't actually detract from Ikki's character at all, as his motivations and goals are expressed decently well throughout Cavalry's runtime, but it feels hard to latch onto this goal when we don't even have a semi-clear picture of what's at the finish line. This happens all the time with stuff like the main heroine Stella Vermillion coming from some country to go to this prestigious magic school in Japan. We are to assume this is the real world since the setting is still Japan, but an explanation on how this country came to being. Was it because of this World War we heard about once, but once again, never was cared to explain? I could go on forever about this, but there are some actual positives of this show I need to address.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, even though the animation wasn't all that great, you could really tell that the staff was really trying with this show. Shin Oonuma, the director of Calvalry, as well as my favourite romance anime of all time, Ef: a tale of memories, really loves using colour (and, in some cases, lack of colour) to set the mood of the scene and the characters at any given time. Although I think he did it to much greater effect in Ef, he still did a good job here with it. There are also some really ambitious camera angles and movements here, and while they can be fairly jerky from time to time, they add a cool perspective and dimension to the fight scenes, which probably would have been fairly lackluster without them. \\n\\n\r\nEven though this is kind of a basic thing, I really do appreciate that the powers and character designs actually correlate to the personality of any given character. Take Stella Vermillion, for example, who is a very forward and passionate person. Her more western-looking broadsword, her extremely hot flames, and even her bodacious body type all emphasize this. While, like I said earlier, the characters are still fairly certainly basic anime tropes with a slight twist, these details really help to add depth to these characters where they otherwise wouldn't be. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the romance, well, I can't really say it it did too much for me. It progressed way too fast with not enough justification as to why it was moving at such a breakneck speed. I can't not say that it wasn't nice to see a romance ACTUALLY PROGRESSING IN AN ANIME, but the novelty wears off after a while if there isn't much substance to back it up.\\n\\n\r\nI also have to call attention to the fanservice briefly. I have to give major props to this show for making the fanservice at least slightly relevant to the plot and characters (for example, once again, Stella\\n\r\ns body type working off of her personality, etc.) of Calvary, rather than it just being what it says on the tin. There is A LOT of fanservice here, and the fact that it is sort of justified in some scenarios doesn't change the fact that if you don't like fanservice, you won't like it here, but I appreciate the effort the staff made to keep it kinda classy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, the absolute by far best part of this show. The fucking opening is baller. The first time I heard this thing, I getting an air of familiarity from the vocalist, only to find out that Sakai Mikio did the opening for Planetes over 11 years ago. I liked the Planetes opening well enough, but this outclasses it easily, with the fast-paced instrumentation, the uniquely deep vocals from Mikio, and the overall jazzy vibe from the thing. \\n\\n\r\nHonest to god, this show tried. It really did. The interesting directing choices, the design choices of the characters making actual sense, and even making the fan-service relevant. However, these things still just cover up a lot of the problems that many of these types of shows have. The story isn't that interesting, the goals and motivations of characters are handled decently, especially with Ikki, but are loosely represented because of the basic tropes of these characters, and the world-building, once again, is really bad. The thing is, though, while this show doesn't really hold up as far as the general anime landscape goes, as far as the type of show it's categorized under, it excels past many of it's peers. So if you are specifically looking for a show that fits under light novel ecchi harem (okay, it really isn't a harem, but whatever) battle series, this is probably one of the best shows you will get. Seriously, I give the staff major credit for not trying to make a by the books generic LN adaptation like so many others seem to be, but they still fell a little short unfortunately. A decent in-between watch, but nothing memorable really at all. Still enjoyable in many cases however, and considering how lackluster 2015 was for anime, this actually stands out as one of the better shows.",

            "content": "[I do not plan to put any spoilers in this review, only a small bit of story to get my opinion across.]\r\nStory: The story is definitely no different then animes of the same caliber. Although the story is generic, I still find it to be extremely enjoyable. The best part of the storyline is the romance between the two main characters, Ikki Kuroguna and Stella Vermillion.\r\nCharacters: Surprisingly, the characters have depth. The anime does not waste a character. With every character you meet you get a nice slice of information to go with them. Which definitely adds to the story. I feel as if thisis a very important aspects animes fail to do. Although the slice is small for some, it's still something.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: The art is definitely nothing to be taken for granted. The batters are really well done. The sound track also does a great job, although in animes like this I hardly pay attention to the sound track.\\n\\n\r\nMy final conclusion: So let's begin, Ikki Kurogana is a boy born into a family known for it's great warriors, but unfortunately Ikki is seen as the weakest boy in his family and is not given an ounce of acknowledgment is whole life. But despite this he still finds kindness for others and does his best to aspire to a position where he will be recognized. Stella Vermilion is a girl born into royalty and the exact opposite of Ikki position wise. She's strong and very well known for her strength and definitely deserves it. She meets Ikki in a very unpleasant situation, but from that moment there's a small spark between them and this is definitely the reason I find this anime enjoyable. You see most of the time I don't give animes with ecchi much hope, specially an anime like this that has a very intense amount of it. But what this anime does with it is nice. Unlike most animes that use ecchi/fan service to add comedy to an anime, such as putting the main character in a position of misunderstanding (Which does happen in this anime a bit here and there.) This anime uses ecchi to deepen the bond between Ikki and Stella. Which is refreshing because it's good to see such a deep one on one relationship between two characters. Not to mention it blends in action with this level of romance and splashes just a little bit of sadness in-between. I have not doubt that the 2nd season for this anime (Hopefully there is one!) will be even better. Most animes with one on one romance are slices of life confined to the non-fantasy world inside a high-school, so it is such a great thing to find an anime that dwells in this world of fantasy with a romance between two people and only two people.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for some amazing battles with mature relationship between two people, I would recommend this anime to you. I can tell you it will be a bit hard to sink into the first few episodes because believe me I was there, but I can definitely tell you if you make it to the end you'll be dropping the second season on your \"Definitely Plan to Watch\" List. Definitely keep this one a chance!",

            "content": "This series falls very easily under the \"judging a book by it's cover\" syndrome that deters many people from watching great shows, either from not immediately liking the art style or just finding it plain dumb or clich\u00e9. Any casual or avid anime watcher will immediately recognize Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry's cover as just plain \"generic\" as far as action/harem/romance/school series go, and really, they wouldn't be wrong. The series in itself ticks off pretty much every anime cliche in the book, ranging from overpowered MC that is regarded as weak but through some bullshit manages to be the strongest, a princess tsundere main heroine/loveinterest, and an overly attached loli sister. And that's just going through it's characters. But really, the series itself manages to be far more than just that as you would quickly start to realize upon watching the show. It has a charming twist on traditional characters and archetypes from the medium which surprised many people when the show was initially airing, which makes this show a lot more than it initially appears to be.\\n\\n\r\n(6/10) The story in Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is so generic that it's synopsis could be guessed by any anime watcher, casual or otaku. Basically, there exists people with strange supernatural powers that are a manifestation of their soul which can be physically used as weapons. These people are called \"Blazers\" (of course there's a catchy name that makes no sense), and there are obviously high schools which train people who are recognized as so. Enter our main character, Ikki Kurogane, an F-Rank Blazer who appears to have zero talent but was still accepted to a prestigious Blazer academy, that wishes to surpass his samurai father and become an ultimate swordsman despite having \"0\" potential. Upon walking into his dorm room and finding a stripping princess named Stella Vermillion who is apparently his roommate, he gets slapped immediately and is challenged to a duel. Upon easily crushing this A-Rank Blazer princess due to his secret OP powers, they develop their relationship from then on. \\n\\n\r\nAt first read, this anime doesn't seem worthwhile to watch. It sounds very similar to many other shows in the genre (Namely The Irregular at Magic High School), and there are few reasons why this wouldn't be true. The plot is about as generic as it gets, but the show progresses nonetheless and it interesting enough to captivate most people that have some kind of interest in the show at the start. It starts to pick up towards the end and has a surprising turn of events that you wouldn't normally find in this kind of show, but the rest is fairly stale but entertaining enough to watch through. \\n\\n\r\n(9/10) The animation and art are both top notch. The action sequences are easily on par with full on action shows with high production quality, as expected since this show meets that criteria itself. The backgrounds and characters both are nothing short of eye candy for any viewer, even if they aren't paying particular attention to those kinds of details. It falls short of a full 10 rating due to looking very generic despite the beautiful lighting and animation, especially the characters themselves. Although this is a fairly moot complaint considering the anime was simply mirroring the LN art style.\\n\\n\r\n(9/10) Sound was great, pretty much no complaints there. The OST was very good, it stood out very well during action sequences and even just regular conversations or expositional scenes. Sound effects were as expected, nothing particularly stood out there. It was done well and it did it's job. The only thing I didn't like very much was the opening and ending; they were both fairly forgettable and didn't have that \"punch\" that makes them worthwhile and memorable.\\n\\n\r\n(7/10) Characters were, well, all pretty much based on generic anime archetypes. However, some of them managed to give a nice twist on those archetypes which made the show that much more enjoyable. For instance, the main heroine and love interest Stella could very easily have been a regular, degrading and downright bitchy tsundere that you see in many anime, both mainstream or not. In a pleasant surprise, even after the first episode you start to see that she has a LOT more \"dere\" to her than \"tsun\", which quickly becomes evident in the following episodes. Due to this satisfying change of pace, she becomes a likable character to pretty much anybody who likes the tsundere archetype in general. One of the more important side characters, Nagi Arisuin, or simply \"Alice\" is an older sister type character that embodies a feminine male. He's charming and is a good character that supports the main cast throughout, especially Ikki's little sister, Shizuku. Shizuku herself, although she has a serious case of bro-con, is surprisingly mature despite her initial appearance and develops very realistically over the course of the series. Speaking of Ikki, well, he honestly doesn't have a lot of stand-out qualities that would make him any different from a normal harem/action hero protagonist. He's your average \"hero of justice\", \"nice guy\" and \"Talk-no-Jutsu/Humanitarian\" overpowered cool guy that never loses once over the course of the series to any opponent, despite being called \"The Worst One\" numerous times. There are many people who dislike this kind of character, but despite his clearly word-for-word copied personality from the book of main character cliches, he does have his redeeming qualities as well. He tends to be a lot more cool headed around females in comparison to your usual harem MC, and he manages to keep his temper very well against some... people that need to be burned on a cross. And it would be downright shameful if I didn't admit that he was too cool to be true.\\n\r\nIn general, the main cast of characters, although generic, have their redeeming points which make them different to the norm and in general make the series worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\n(9/10) My general enjoyment and entertainment derived from this series was very high. I watched the entire thing in one day and was thoroughly famished by it's plot, characters, and art despite having very little interest in the general genre of \"superpower highschool/harem\" series. The anime managed to stray far enough away from the general stereotypes that it was a great experience, even for someone like me. The conclusion was okay, it was a cliffhanger but still managed to feel conclusive even though it really didn't tie up much of anything. It left a huge gaping path for a second season, which I definitely would appreciate personally.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the show is very good, and although it appears very generic at first, it is definitely a different experience from normal superpower highschool-harem-action anime, so much so that it makes the watch very enjoyable even for someone who isn't a particular fan of the genre. For romance fans, it is established very quickly, far more quickly than normal and develops well over the course of the series, but left more to be desired as the show veered dangerously close to harem status. It's tied up well, but explaining how would be a spoiler. If you like romance in general, I'd say give this one a shot.",

            "content": "I choose this anime to watch because it had been a while since i last watched a harem and this anime seemed to also include action.  The first 1-3 episodes played out like a typical harem with decent action but then the story took a twist   . To my genuine pleasure and surprise, i give this anime a 9/10. Now to explain why:\r\nSTORY:\r\n  The story is nothing new or different.  The story wasn't particularly strong either so why give it a 9/10? Well the one thing that this anime excels at is knowing its limits.  Supposedly knights are beingtrained to fight against an enemy but none of that is relevant. It follows one guys trying to reach a goal. There are obstructions towards that goal that he has to overcome.\\n\\n\r\n CHARACTERS:\\n\r\nBecause the story is focused (to an reasonably extent), it sets up for good character development. Characters have good reasoning and motivations. The protagonist is very likable. He always wants to do things fairly and takes pride in that. He is not overpowered, rather he has to strive for has goals.  Finally this kind of anime, secondary characters are usually part of the harem with no real personality. This in not the care in this anime. Kurogane, Shizuku, a secondary character ( in my eyes)  is a badass sister who shows signs of maturity, acceptance. \\n\\n\r\nART and SOUND:\\n\r\nart style and sound are highly biased categories. what music we like is highly opinionated. Because person A hates a particular track, doesnt mean person B will also hate it and vise-versa. To me personally neither the sound or art stood out. I never though \"Wow this is beautifully calligraphed\"  or how interesting a particular shot was framed ( camera-wise). In that regard i leave sound and art up to the viewer to judge on their own.\\n\\n\\n\r\nto end the review my enjoyment was 10 because the anime went beyond my expectations. It had a very unexpected surprise, good likable characters and a focused story that knew its limits.  \\n\\n\r\nyou know what i was going to give this anime a 9/10 but never giving 10s is stupid. yes art and sound weren't fantastic in my opinion but that shouldn't prevent it from getting a 10.",

            "content": "Ya know, I actually had to look up the names of the characters in this show before I wrote this review. I made an emphasis that I was going to expound on the bare minimal character development, but that only goes to show how cliche, bland, and unimpressive they were. I see 8's and 9's throughout the review section, and I understand that that is their opinion, however, I feel that as a piece of work alone it cannot be judged greater than a 6 at most. Here's why.\r\nStory (6/10) The production team at Silver Linx Studios came together and said, \"Listen, we need anew show thats gonna be a huge hit.\" To which one replied, \"Lets throw in all the shonen cliches, a competition, swords, and romance.....ohh and BEWBS!\" This won unanimous favor and was what we received in the form of Rakudai Kishi no Calvary. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it. However, the story was a recycled plot by taking all the tropes and scenarios from popular anime and meshed it together. They believed that to pander to a large audience, they should take all the good parts of anime and combine it into one. However, they failed miserably as a piece of art. The story is chaotic and rubbish. We have, yet again, an OP main character fighting his way to the top of another battle royale to gain recognition from someone. However, instead of being a steady sequence of events; the plot cuts off here and there to add some character dialogue and filler entertainment. The battle royale was the main focus in the early episodes yet strayed into the unknown background by the finale: which is fine but there was no set reason or explanation to do so other than a weak side plot. Then we had the extremely weak backstories for all the main characters....and when I mean weak I mean WEAK. I'm not one of those types to not fully explain my reasoning for hating on a show. I'll explain it in the Character section. Overall, the story was partially enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) I really need to figure out a scaling system of art styles. I don't really remember if I hated the art style in any anime. The reason I won't give this a 9 or a 10 is simply because this show uses an overused art medium and it didnt stand out in any particular way. What do I mean by overused? The characters are all crisp and clear, yes. The fight scenes are clean cut, yes. However, there was nothing new. Each character fit into a anime cut-out sequence: in this case, each one wore the school uniform. There was nothing really outstanding about the artwork. It was just that the characters blended in with the plot flow. The setting is an academy.....so everyone needs to wear a school uniform cliche. It's a shame really.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) I enjoyed the opening quite a bit. I'm gonna steal from another review here only because he described the opening best as (twangy/Western)...which were my thoughts but credit is due to that guy for writing it. The opening introduced or \"hyped\" the action fight sequence yet was a complete downer when the action came. There was no real \"feel\" or \"depth\" to the fights. It was just.....there. The only real depth was that one fight for revenge, that was it but that was simply introduced through faulty forethought and planning, which is sinful. The soundtrack/sound effects were solid. The ending had an Enka-influence so that was a tad interesting. Other than that, nothing really stood out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) I'm skipping character for now on purpose. I believe my character paragraph is easily going to be the longest, so think of this as an intermission from my long digression of my disgust with this show. Did I enjoy it, yes. Sadly, I did. I'm a sucker for sword fights and this pulled me in hook, line, and sinker. However, I'm self-aware enough to know just how bad this show was.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4/10) Simply put: there was none. I'm going to address each main character in following paragraphs explaining why. Just don't get your pants in a twist if you get hurt. Rant on my comment section if you want to. It's there for a reason.\\n\\n\r\nIkki: Apparently, Silver Linx Studio's production team really loves SAO and Shokugeki no Soma.....so the main character is none other than Kirito/Soma or Kiroma if it were. Why? Ikki steals the badass swordplay, the occasional witty maxims, and the chick magnetism straight from Kirito. I couldnt give enough examples of that. He also steals the \"ordinary guy becomes badass through lots of successes and failures and wants to earn recognition from Dad\" straight from Yukihira Soma. So he's a perfect blend of the two. Why do I have a problem with this? The backstory is too bland. It's the overused tale of a man hated for his failures or ineptitude in a certain field. Although, it tries to reel me in to connect with him, the overused stereotype prevents me from doing so to the point where I am desensitized to care about it. Second problem I have, the overpowered cliche. Its fine to be overpowered, I dont care. However, you need to connect the audience to how he got there. Just simply glossing over the fact that he trained really hard is not gonna cut it. You need visual samples. You need to show the failures....the countless failures to actually begin a tie with the audience. Trying to weave a character such as this is ridiculously hard in 12 episodes. However, what separates Yukihira and Ikki in this category is the fact that Shokugeki no Soma actually showed how he got to that point. His failures. His progress. His breakthroughs. to the point where you can \"feel\" the character logic and understand and cheer him on. Thats the difference.\\n\\n\r\nStella Vermillion: Already, they stole the \"Crimson Princess\" title straight from Highschool DxD. In the first episode, they introduce her as a condescending Class A imitation of Nakiri Erina: again from Shokugeki no Soma. She comes from a higher lineage who has latent talent far greater than that of the main character and the rest of the academy (again, Shokugeki no Soma). Her barking attitude, her demand for respect all point her as a culprit of a snobby. spoiled childhood. however, at the end of the first episode....they COMPLETELY TURN TAILS! It was as if the production team were reading volume 1 of Shokugeki while producing the first episode and realized they were copying it and said, \"Whoops, gotta do something different here.\" She completely loses her condescension even when addressing her rival, Ikki's sister, and the show expects us to believe that it was because of that fanservice mishap in the dorm room. Thats my biggest dislike of her character. Other than that, I think she's fine. Too much emphasis on the fanservice. A really, really rushed romance with the main character that recovered in the end.....reasons that you need to explore yourself cuz spoilers. Oh, and she wasnt turned into a supportive waifu material by the production team....which is good. I would've been pissed if she got weaker simply to illustrate the \"white knight saving the damsel in distress\" cliche, and I ain't even feminist.\\n\\n\r\nShizuku: Again, the production team came together and said, \"Listen, we need more clickbait.\" To which one replied, \"Let's put in a loli!\" however, in this case there was not a unanimous agreement. They pondered, \"We cant simply just put a loli in there for no reason.\" Then they came up with the brilliant solution: Incest ex machina! Yes, the family incest situation is back! I aint lying.....she literally is there for fanservice and incest. It's incredibly disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nNagi Arisun (Alice) The production team came together one more time to discuss the final main character. They posed the question, \"Listen, we need to pander to a larger audience...most of the people who will watch this are males and otakus (an undefined gender).\" Then one man raised his hand,  \"Let's put a gay guy in there for the homosexual demographic and political awareness!\" Thus, Alice was born. As described in the character development, \"A woman born inside a man's body.\" Thats literally how Alice described himself. Now do I have anything against gays? No! Of course not dude! I have a problem with introducing a character for political and gender clickbait and thats it. There was no character development which ticked me off even more.\\n\\n\r\nRest of the cast: extremely forgettable and hardly mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This was an extremely forgettable show. It was interesting, yet failed to stick out in any sort of way. The characters and art all blended in together with the faulty plot flow to form a uniform bland color....one not worth mentioning. Would I recommend this show to you? Nah. Its hardly worth watching. It was enjoyable, yet I cant find a justifiable reason to share it with anyone else. Its like recommending Pacific Rim for that scene where the robot drags the cargo freight through the city and bashes the monster over the head with it........oh and the sword too, that was cool. So, I hope you enjoyed this review. It was long, but I felt like I needed to explain why I had a problem with the characters in detail. So, have a good day! Cuz why not cheer up your mood when you read this depressing debacle?",

I found this anime really enjoyable, because was easy to watch no big plot holes, or weird story lines, no sad deads, and was 12 episodes long, i found this anime like an action movie, like die hard, bourne orjohn wick that kind of story where the MC always win with the only difference that there's magic, swords instead of guns and the hot girls are a tsundere and a loli ;p\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story  is about a guy who is called the worst one because he has almost non magical power and he is in a magical fighting school(no wonder why they called him that), for some reasons he is bullied for both teachers and students, but because a new director arrived he suddenly has the chance to prove his worth. In the very first chapter you will see him fight with the best student, so the story go straight to the point. The fights are really good i enjoy all of them, especially the one of Lorelei against Rakiri, so for the action factor you are cover. The romance is pretty fast and forward, i don't  but don't worry it works at least for me, i like it, i have a thing for tsunderes so that may help. the ecchi is really light i think is use like 3 or 4 times, maybe less, so the girls shouldn't be concerned about it. all and all i think is a good anime you should watched.\\n\\n",

            "content": "- Overview -\r\nRakudai Kishi no Cavalry is a positively surprising addition to the Magical Sword Battle genre. The setup is a fairly standard \"super powered teens playing with swords and magic in a school,\" and it doesn't push any major boundaries in terms of storytelling. It plays on the familiar theme of chivalry and honor, even in the face of impossible odds. It's all quite recognizable, but presented in the background so that it doesn't really stick out. \r\nWhere the show really excels at is the characters.  All the major characters are interesting and at least somewhat relatable. They all have their strength andweaknesses, with their own personality flaws and expectations, and they genuinely grow and develop throughout the seasons. It\u2019s easy to find yourself liking even so-called enemies as long as they are honorable, and when the show makes you want to not like a character, they manage to accomplish that without any trouble.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, the animation is clean and crisp, though rather limited in terms of backgrounds. Fortunately, this does not prevent the battle scenes from being quite fast and intense. Perhaps they could have spared a bit more detail when it came to characters, but I get the feeling that they were working with fairly limited resources. The audio fits the mood, but doesn\u2019t really stick out. There are not really any distinct sound effects, and the music is sort of just there. The saving grace here are the voice actors. They manage to really give life to their characters, and deliver a spirited performance that really suits the theme.\\n\\n\r\nAll together it\u2019s actually a surprisingly enjoyable experience. While neither the story, nor the technical presentation were stellar, the series was saved by enjoyable and interesting characters that managed to grow and evolve throughout the show. I don\u2019t want to count off too much for issues that were most likely the result of a tight budget, so I will solidly recommend this for anyone that isn\u2019t instantly turned away by the genre. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\n- Characters -\\n\\n\r\nThis is the true strength of Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry. Everything from the visual design, to the voices, the personalities, and even the development of the characters was very well done. \\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters, Ikki and Stella are immediately likable, though they might not immediately like each other. They both carry their own burdens, but they still remain good at heart. They\u2019re funny, emotive, and they all have their own very distinct personalities.\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point here is the relationship in the series. This is a rare series that will show a relationship in progress, as it slowly grows from something simple, to something more serious and romantic. What more, this is a rare series that will show characters showing that rare ability of conflict resolution that does not normally get much play in series of this genre. \\n\\n\r\nEven the side characters are interesting and likable. They all have their own unique quirks, and they can all show unexpected that ties back to the main characters in interesting and sometimes unexpected ways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show can stand up proudly within the category of characters. It\u2019s earned it. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n- Story -\\n\\n\r\nThe story for Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is something you\u2019ve seen a dozen times if you make a habit of watching series like this. There is a special school, for special kids, that have special super powers, and these kids have to fight because reasons. You can expect many of the normal plot points, all the way from the poor unloved kid who\u2019s never had the chance to shine all the way to his super big awesome climax. It\u2019s more or less checking off the Hero\u2019s Journey checklist, but it does it well.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a constant running theme of chivalry and honor; there\u2019s a lot about protecting the weak, and not abusing your power. There is a fair bit of self-betterment, and dealing with the impossible and persevering. In all it tries to carry an uplifting feeling throughout the entire season.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, it serves the purpose of being a stage for the characters, so I can\u2019t really complain. (7/10)\\n\\n\r\n- Art and Audio -\\n\\n\r\nYou can tell very quickly that the art budget for this show was limited. There are not too many backgrounds, with very few grand vistas, and quite a bit of reused materials. The characters, while nice looking, do not have too much depth when it comes to animation outside of battle scenes. Even the battle scenes seem to be about doing more with less. (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the sound effects sound like they came from an audio library, sometimes with different quality effects one after another. The music doesn\u2019t really set the tone as much as follow it, and occasionally it gets too lout and overwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, as I already mentioned, the major voice actors really aced their parts. The characters all sound great, and manage to convey a lot of the emotion that the animation doesn\u2019t present. I also have to give someone props for the main character\u2019s tagline, \u201cWith my strongest I will defeat your strongest.\u201d Come on, that\u2019s just awesome. (7/10)\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment -\\n\\n\r\nDespite the many shortcomings, this anime is a great watch, assuming you don\u2019t mind Magical Schools, Battles, Romances, and a bit of Ecchi. It\u2019s a show carried by the characters, and they manage to keep it up throughout the entire seasons. (9/10)\\n",

This anime brought out my emotions unlike any other anime has!\r\nThe pros: Everything. The storyline was great. The character development was great.the MC was great! the almost Taboo touches were amazing! This anime touched on so many parts i wished other harem anime would've touched on.  Like in SAO it took forever for them to admit they liked each other. In this anime, it was almost instant.  Mutual respect turned into love, and no spoilers, but they do stay together!\\n\\n\r\nThe Cons: Im only putting this here cause some people are sensitive to anime pushing the limits. The anime touched on some light hentai, but that was ok. The cursing (which i do alldayeveryday) was a lot more than any other anime I've seen. But it was still amazing.\\n\\n\r\nI wished that i cooldve given this anime more than a 10/10. That is how amazing it is, and it will skyrocket to your number 1\\n\\n\r\n-JNutter3006",

All those other animes the guy gets into an ecchi situation and cries or gets red faced and runs away, completely unrealistic and just plain idiotic.\r\nIkki follows through with his ambition, the female (Stella) has a bit more tendencies of those other p***y male protagonists but she pulls through.\r\nThat's a hugething because I've been watching ecchi animes for years and it's usually the same crap every time. So this one gets high marks.\\n\\n\r\nTo top everything off, it's got a solid story, good background for the characters (with good development), some pretty dang annoying antagonists that make you hate them, and overall an enjoyable one to watch.

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*\r\nScrolling through the countless rave reviews, one would assume Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is a masterpiece of the 21st century. Even without holding high expectations, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is a major disappointment.\r\nStory 3/10\r\nThis anime tried too hard to cram different lengthy ideas into 12 episodes, ending up with a disappointing mishmash of ideas. Although the plot relied on the overused \"defying all the odds\" formula, the story was actually decent and interesting. However, the lengthy story meant that there was no way for it to be completed well, let alone add the romance and other arcs. The pacing was increasingly rushed throughthe first 10 episodes, at times abruptly slowing down. The real issue was how at least 6 episodes of content were forced into the 2 last episodes. Personally, the worst sign of a rushed anime was shown when the highly anticipated final fight took 2 minutes to finish.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was nice and smooth. The monochromatic palette with streaks of vibrant colours that was used in the finale was exciting and certainly could have been utilised more. The glaring mistake was when they used some crappy CGI rendering to make the 3D rock monsters which was a harbinger of a strained budget or laziness.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\r\nThe OP and ED was decent, but nothing special. The soundtrack was entirely forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10\\n\r\nMost of the characters felt cookie-cutter and lacked proper character development. The one character (MC) with actual depth had a cliched backstory and was disappointing. To add insult to injury, the romance tag in the genre categorisation was largely undeserved. The contrived relationship between Ikki and Stella was constantly pushed into the viewers' faces, causing me to cringe at the artificial relationship progression.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\r\nThough the action scenes were exciting, the awful pacing made this anime tough to watch at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\r\nHad this anime been twice the length, it would actually have been very good. Unfortunately, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry was simply too ambitious. I would not recommend this anime.",

            "content": "If I had to describe this anime in one word it'd be: Forgettable. I literally watched this entire anime through once, then a year later watched it again because I had forgotten that I already had. That being said, the only thing I did remember were some of the fights. They were actually quite original, clever and well done. A standout versus the rest of the anime.\r\nStory: 3\r\nThere's little to no development in the overarching story arc and the plot for every few episodes is just a couple of mini-stories. The exposition of their 'magic' powers is secondary to the sword skills of the MC.Everything about the world they're living in seems inconsequential and the driving points of each mini-story so overplayed that it really comes off as more of a 'slice of life' anime if anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason I get this feeling is that characters more or less pop up as-necessary to fill out the episode and the existing characters not really expanded on.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nAlmost sub-par for a 2015 production. The first ep was heavily CG involving some really overdone shadow work and 3D animation that was a little off-putting. There's a frequent recurring cherry-blossom theme that plagues the series that wears out pretty quickly.\\n\\n\r\nOh, there's quite a bit of fanservice especially around the female lead which mostly acts as unnecessary filler and isn't that appealing. Go watch hentai instead.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nIt's hard to screw up sound production. The music was okay and the SFX appropriate. The voice actors were all pretty good and they didn't use as many English words as other animes which was nice. They did well enough with hitting the right notes to the right tropes that it would trigger the automatic emotional response in me to certain scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nIt really feels like they just threw every archetype in the genre together in order to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. I actually got confused and thought this anime was from like...2010 or something. If it was actually the case I'd rate it higher and forgive the people who like this anime because then at least the brother x sister, transgender, trap, loli trope-characters would be a tiny bit ahead of it's time but alas, it's very late to the party.\\n\\n\r\nEven then, there's so little development between the supporting roles because the main focus is on the, quite normal, awkward relationship between the two main characters which just feels stale. Why? Because there's no ups and downs in their relationship. Just pretty standard getting to know each other and trouble expressing their feelings. All of which is usually glanced over rather quickly. They both have problems and intriguing backstories but they're never properly fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nI'm not sure why I watched this to completion. I guess I just needed to find out what happens in the end. The characters have their typically cute interactions based on their archetype but there's rarely any development between the supporting roles.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some actually pretty cool fights and they're definitely the highlight and most memorable part of the anime; but it'd definitely be more enjoyable, for me at least, if the fan-service was toned down in favour of the fighting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nRakudai Kishi no Cavalry is a messy conglomeration of ideas that attempt to please as many people as possible without doing anything well. When you really think about it, the philosophy behind the production of this anime is similar to producing camouflage. When the random noise and colour all come together there's just no way to distinguish it from everything else you've watched and hence: I forgot all about it.",

Yes.\r\nDoes that make it a bad show, deserving of an overall 3? No.\r\nThis show had some amazing artwork and animation, on par with some of the best animation that I have ever seen, even with the few moments where it has mistakes due to how it was drawn.\r\nMany of the characters in the show had just the right amount of backstory given throughout it to give the viewer a feeling that theyknow and understand the character.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost all of the fight scenes were amazingly detailed and well animated.\\n\\n\r\nSounds and music within the show were just right, to the point where you would feel something missing if it weren't there, and it doesn't overpower the show when it is there, which is how I think it should be.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors for this show were fantastic. In many of the scenes, you could feel the emotions from the characters although I won't go into detail on which, because it would be spoilers, but a hint is that it deals with Stella.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a great show that gave me much enjoyment while watching, and I would gladly watch it again.

            "content": "This is only my second review, so bear with the fact, lads. It won't be long, since the anime itself is only 12 episodes, and adapts only 3 volumes of the actual LN, which was quite disappointing for me, since I was hoping to at least see more fights.\r\nStory - 7. \r\nWhy? It is cliche, in my opinion. I'm quite a fan of that kind of anime, where you have an MC who is weak, but whoops - he is actually strong. The same happens here - Ikki is the weak beast, who is looked down upon, and our Stella is nothing less than atsundere character (correct me if I'm wrong). However, I really enjoyed the show. I've heard anime like that appear once in a while, and it gets quite common, however, this has something special to it. Whatever it is, the execution of the story was great for me! It always kept me wanting to see the next episode. It starts out as a very straight-forward anime, but later it develops into something darker, at least that's what I thought while watching it! At times it felt predictable for me, but even at those times, it managed to take a turn I actually didn't expect, and I liked that.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9. \\n\r\nNow you may ask why. Even though I loved the fight scenes, they were really something, some fights felt unfinished, or cut out. Maybe that's just me, but I could just feel in some fights, that there could've been something more than what I did or didn't see (for example - the Ten'i Muhou technique during the fight against the 'Soul Eater'). However, overall, everything was very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound. \\n\r\nI'm not a specialist of this, however, the voice acting was great, it fit every character for me, and the music, as well as the fight scene sounds, were all \\n\r\nin place. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9.\\n\r\nThere is one thing to the characters - some were missing, according to LNs. Now that is not a big deal, and I don't consider it a big deal. \\n\r\nThe development was completely fine - we had a weak beast MC, who keeps winning the fights, while nobody knows how he actually feels or what has happened to him, that he is the 'Worst One'. Overtime, he manages to get quite a huge fanbase, and that's what will make a significant appearance in the end (trying not to spoil everything). As we should expect, romance develops, while not taking up the space, everything is split to fit everything in, and I'm glad nothing was rushed for me, and the development of both, the relationship, and the story itself, didn't interfere each other and leave anything behind.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - I really enjoyed the anime, it was something that after watching, I can say 'Wow, that was cool!'. I was only disappointed it ended at volume 3, however, the journey was great. Now, to make sure - yes, it has an ecchi tag in this anime, however, the amount of ecchi you see, compared to other anime, is pretty much zero, because it's not that kind of show-off ecchi you see everyday, and is almost non-existent (*cough* lodge *cough*). So even if you're against ecchi, I still highly recommend trying this out if you have this in your list. It's a great one.",

They just suck, I mean if you like them that's obviously fine, I don't care if anyone watches midget incest inter-specie porn let alone fan service anime but it's not for me. BUT this piece of shit garbage which I can't  help but call garbage has made a tsundere out of me! Holy christ jesus of the lord almighty god! \r\nOverall:\r\nThe show is at its best whenit doesn't take itself seriously, when it's just fun and comedy and at its worst when it goes through the dramatic moments. It's not that I don't like dramatic or sappy moments, it's just you don't really buy it that much here. You buy enough of it tho, so I guess that's okay. Especially in the latter episodes where the tonal shift is just too abrupt and you will find it hard to believe the things that are going on, but they pass over though it quickly and go back to the things you want to see. \\n\r\nIt's an enjoyable show, if you just watched something serious, then this is an alright palette cleanser. I was pleasantly surprised, nothing to write home about but worth the time as well.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story is well, there. They focus almost entirely on the two main characters and almost nothing else. Premise is this, whatever comes into your mind when you read the words school, weakest, secret power, girl, contest. Whatever you thought of, that's the story. It serves as nothing else but a container for whatever ridiculous thing the two main characters will go through.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt's okay, it's disappointing because some battle scenes are detailed but at that crucial moment of showing how someone beats someone else, you only see the result and not how they did it. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis was executed well in my opinion. It has a lot of light tone that conveys immediately that it's not a serious anime nor does this anime take itself seriously, well, for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are fucking strange, probably because I don't watch ecchi/harem animes so the tropes are unfamiliar to me BUT they are likable. They are competent and that's important or else you won't buy the relationship of the two main characters and the other character they come in contact with.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis was for the most part, really fun! The characters are likable enough, you can take the characters seriously even though you accept that they are quite ridiculous. The situation they find themselves in, the unexpected things that happen and some action interspersed, it's quite enjoyable. But to be honest, it's really the comedy that did it for me, tho the comedy somewhat mellows down in the latter episodes, the show didn't lose me.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Chivalry of a Failed Knight is by far one of my favorite series to have come out in recent times. This is a series that, in spite of its sorta cliche'd storyline, breaks many tropes and actually does a good job of developing characters and further telling an excellent story. While there is at least one anime this season that, storywise, could be considered better, in terms of pure personal enjoyment, this is the best.\r\nThe story itself is nothing new. It's about a young man named Ikki Kurogane, who attends a magic school where people battle using blazers, weapons formed from the soul, or something.The magic high school cliche has been quite popular recently, and anyone watching this anime would feel that this story is a stereotypical light novel adaptation. I've even heard snobs who call themselves anime critics claiming that this anime is \"light novel trash\" because its an adaptation. Of course, most of those people completely ignore the fact that most anime is adapted from something, whether it's a manga or a light novel - and they all have their cliches.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins when Ikki, after doing his daily morning exercise, enters his dorm room to find a half-naked girl changing. Rather than blushing and stuttering out apologies, Ikki does what any good gentleman would do to make a girl feel less uncomfortable: Take of his own clothes so they're even. This is the first of many standard cliche's that are broken in Chivalry of a Failed Knight, and is one of the reasons I love this anime. I love how the main character's not some dweeb who follows standard harem dynamics. Ikki Kurogane is the only protagonist I have ever seen who's done this, and for that reason, he instantly became one of my favorites.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing Ikki Kurogane, you've got Stella Vermillion, the princess to a small Kingdom who needs strong magical knights to protect themselves. Stella is, to put it bluntly, adorable. She starts off with a typical tsundere feel. However, the more you see of her, the less tsundere she becomes. In fact, rather than a tsundere I'd say she's a normal girl who happens to have some minor tsundere traits. And when she does show off her tsundere side, she's usually more dere than tsun, which is what makes her so adorable. Furthermore, unlike most tsunderes who deny her feelings and become unstable and violent for no reason, Stella doesn't deny anything. I like how she's able to talk about her feelings, rather than simply go, \"B-baka! It's not like I want to be with you or anything!\" Honestly, the standard tsundere traits get old, which makes her a more than welcome character.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story itself is nice, one of my greatest pleasures, and the reason this ranks as my top anime for 2015, was watching the growing relationship between Stella and Ikki. You almost never see a couple in anime who officially become a couple. Most of the time, the couple will dance around each other for the entire season, and when the season ends, you're left scratching your head wondering if they're a couple or just a tsukkomi duo who have a thing for each other. Not so here. In Chivalry, Ikki and Stella are the OTP. I don't even have to ship them! These two ship themselves! This is the only anime to have satisfied my desire for a good romance between the two protagonists so completely.\\n\\n\r\nEverything else about this anime is pretty decent. The artwork is surprisingly nice, though not the best. I actually enjoy the artistic style and liberties taken throughout this anime. The person who made this must have been a woman, too, because their sense of fashion is impressive. I can't see a dude being so attentive to clothing. Furthermore, the animation is well-done. It's not amazing, but it's good enough that I didn't see any errors with the sequences or massive problems, like characters moving outside of their base models. The fight scenes, in particular, were quite stellar, and I enjoyed watching how the battles in this played out.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime does have its fan service, but the fan service is very mild and doesn't come around very often. The fan service was also tasteful enough that people who don't like it could probably tolerate it. I actually thought some of the moments were cute, especially since, aside from the first moment where Ikki walks in on Stella while she's changing, almost every single fan service-y moment was instigated by Stella herself - which is just another reason I like Stella so much. Like Ikki with his, \"I saw you naked, so I'll let you see me naked,\" attitude, Stella breaks away from traditional tsundere tropes and becomes more than what her archetype dictates. Overall, this is my favorite anime of the season, and if it ever gets a season two, you can be sure I'll watch it.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork: 9/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 9.5/10\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nTotal: 9.810",

I feel like a character like this was not needed in the anime. Maybe some side story stuff would be better than introducing a character that takes all the attention.\r\nAlso thefact that the relationship between Kurogane and Stella develops so quickly is kindda disappointing, I mean no two characters should get that intimate within 2 or 3 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, these little things that I pointed out won't really influence your experience throughout the anime. If you're either a fan of good straight romance, ecchi, action, fantasy or maybe a little bit of all of them, you'll certainly enjoy this show.",

            "content": "tl;dr\r\nThis review is based on the anime only since I haven't read the LN. I will try to spoil as few as possible, however, some points cannot be given without specific \"example\". In addition, I hope my review will give a different perspective toward this anime inspire of what people have already said about it.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nTo be honest, I could not believe myself that I will give this an 8 out of 10 especially when I was about to drop it half way. At first glance, (specifically the first 6 episodes), it is at best a mediocre product which cannot even be compared with similaranime within the genre. We are talking about a typical setting with abunch of student joining a magic academy specialized in magical-knight (well, to be fair, it is hard to come up with genuine idea given how saturated the genre has become). A typical harem rom-com setup with a blatant nonchalant MC, a tsundere crimson-hair protagonist, a brother-complexed loli sister, etc. A typical goal of winning some 'random' tournament (this time is to graduate from the academy - things cannot make \\n\r\n any less sense at this point, let alone the originality of idea).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I have to say that, the tides have been turned from episode 6 thereafter. Which makes me confused about the true message of the anime. In fact, I could not help but choose to think that the anime is simply badly delivered and expressed. To be specific, what change my opinion can be summary in this quote from episode 12 ( you heard it correctly, the damn episode 12 of all 12)\\n\\n\r\n\"let's not get our kids involved in adults' schemes\"\\n\\n\r\nThis should be categorized as a mature anime (I aware of the PG17 but it seems not sufficient in my opinion). What I am trying to tell? The climax - aka episode 11 tells everything. The story is not about some stupid plot where the MC meaninglessly fights to serve some selfishness reason he could think of. It is actually a reflection of real life, of how the ultimate goal and the struggle to achieve it is. Of how we realize the \"black and white\" color shaped by perception and social norm, the very system that shape the society as it is. This is genuinely shown during the imprisonment of the MC. A It reflects the unfairness treatment rooting on some long lasting tradition, rules that noone even bother to think of. And worst, people are consumed by that thought too deeply that they don't even think on their own and follow the crowd to feed the confusion, rumor on something they don't even know about. (it is based on how people react to the news represented to them in the anime, you will understand what I said if you watch it till the end)\\n\\n\r\nI am so disappointed by how the story proceed yet being impressed by how deep it is especially during the last 3 episodes. It could have been a good shows overall should the focus be made clearer. It doesn't need to be a harem ecchi kind of story (I found this part completely irrelevant to the anime) when you want to deliver such a message to the audience. Heck, we can clearly see a difference in concept between the first half (full of fan service and awkward situation just like in a typical ecchi anime) with the second half (where we see the anime in its \"true\" color most of the time).  This leads me to an overall score of 8/10. It could have been a masterpiece original idea which I cannot find somewhere else.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the story part, I wont mention much this time since art is never my things to say about. To me, it is good enough. I especially like the color concept of the anime (in the second half part of course). It is brilliantly black and white in a way that we rarely see.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI am a diehard fan of anime when it comes to sound effect and songs. In my opinion, the sound is just bad. There is absolutely nothing remarkable about this anime. The OP and ED songs are not good at all, I cannot get the feeling the author want to express.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nHow can I start with this part.\\n\\n\r\nIt is both a big let down and top selling point at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the previous review, you can clearly tell how I enjoy the way Akaza has been sketched. He is cruel, vicious, merciless to the core that we cannot help but hate him about how terrible he is. We can also see the arrogant, pride, disdainful behavior of Kuraudo. Yet he stills respect the truth, the real strength of his opponents. Simply put, the antagonists are amazingly created in my opinion. Their motivation, purpose, are complete. Even though the anime hide them carefully, I got excited to find out why Ikki's father act like that. What does it means by the quote I show you before. It seems strange but it really is realistic to a certain extent (for the most part, it is a magical world anyway so we dont need to be very critical about how close it is to the reality). The way the anime reveals those character also hit the sweet spot of delivering sufficient hint to follow up yet not to spoil too much about them.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the MC and his harem is the biggest let down. He lacks personal development. We knows his intention, his will. But we don't know why he could exceed his limit when he fought another \"mini boss\". To be fair, it is hand down a purely romance setting rather than a harem as I said, but I cannot accept such a fabricated relationship development between our MCs. The girls are also too \"typical\" to the point that I cannot say why should they even exist except for Shizuku. Korogane family circumstance could be a good reason to rationalize her behavior. However, the same cannot be said to others such as Nagi. I dont even know why s/he appear in this anime. There is absolutely no hint at all about his/her background to guess a point or two.\\n\\n\r\nStella is also a problem. She is so tsundere (dont take me wrong, I love tsundere) to the point that it feels so superficial about her relationship  with Ikki. It is just that the relationship is there and it develop just in a way that suppose to be for a tsundere. (are we even talking about the protagonist?)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is something purely personal so I won't say much. I simply looks for a romance anime with some ecchi and possibly harem to begin with but it ends up something I enjoy in the most unexpected way. Heck, the part which I initially look for is just average to be generous so I cannot give anything more than a \"fair\" rating.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads to the overall rating of 6/10. However, the story really stands out for me personally. I wish there could be more \"mature\" content anime just like this to reflect our thought on how the society currently is. \\n",

            "content": "Introduction\r\nI have watched Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry or Chivalry of a Failed Knight a few times and I have to say, it doesn't get boring, it has some similarities with anime in this category or genre but overall, it's a fun anime to get into.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nOverall, the story itself was pretty good but what took away some of the points would definitely be how much it relates to other shows and I know a few shows that follow the exact same story, I hope this doesn't scare anyone away, it's a very good watch and I would recommend it, but I feel like it definitelyhas been used before numerous times.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art, don't even get me started on the art. I loved the art in this show, I can see the artists put a lot of time and thought into each and every character and their personality. I don't really see any points that could be negated from the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound itself was very good, the voice actors are amazing and fit the characters amazingly well, following their characteristics and their personality I feel like the Voice Actors are extremely good for the characters. The point that was negated for sound would definitely be for the Opening, though the opening was definitely catchy, both the video and audio didn't really match what was happening in the show itself, to be honest, the show itself feels Romantic but at the same time, also has a nice amount of action, but the opening felt like something that would be in an anime with a darker plot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEverything in the character side of things came together and made one great aspect of the show, the artists created the characters along with displaying their personalities and some of their characteristics, the writers wrote lines that really stuck out and really showed just what exactly made the characters who they are, the Actors really fit the specific roles perfectly, there are some other anime shows out there where some of the girls or even guys sound like you're scratching your nails on a chalkboard. The backstory was good, even though it was a little generic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nReally, I feel like the Romance is a very good point on what makes this show what it is, but really, the amount of action adds its points as well, it's nice to see a show that isn't PURELY based around action but still has it's own drama aspect to it. All the individual points of this show blend together to make a show that I frequently come back and re-watch because it's really fun!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really hate taking off one point but it definitely wasn't because of the show itself, I feel like the story has been too overused and that's what took away the majority of the feel for me, overall, still an amazing watch and I would re-watch it many times and recommend it to as many people as I could. If you haven't watched it yet, please do.\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I first watched Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, I thought to myself \u201cDidn\u2019t I already watch this episode\u201d. It felt so similar to Gakusen Toshi Asterisk\u2019s first episode, I couldn\u2019t help but think that way. However as time went by, the two followed different paths, and Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry chose the better one. It quickly separates itself from most of the clich\u00e9s it started off with and found the perfect place where it belongs. It\u2019s stylish, it\u2019s entertaining, and it\u2019s quite well written at times. Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is one of those anime that deserves a chance, because it has quite a lotof chances to impress you. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe story focuses on Kurogane Ikki, a knight who is known to be the worst of his school. However he has grown up in harsh conditions as his family has never acknowledged him as a member of their family. Ikki competes in Seven Star Sword Art Festival in order to change is reputation and to get his father\u2019s attention. Throughout his journey, he meets characters such as Stella, Alice, and his sister Shizuku, whom all joint the festival with him. Although the premise of this anime is something we\u2019ve seen many time in many different anime, however Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry aims to be different. It creates a romance for the protagonist rather that a harem, and that itself drastically changes the quality of this anime as character development is a lot stronger with a real romance. Also the story focuses on the relationship between Ikki and Stella connects their situation to real life ones such as affairs between younger ones in hierarchies. Even though the story ends up being nothing too great, the fact that it puts in effort being something great makes it good enough.\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nHere\u2019s where Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry shines. Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry escapes from the anime it first seemed to be. First it manages to be a romantic anime rather than a harem, which helps it creating better character developments and relationships. Secondly it manages to be an ecchi without being distracting. It manages to place its fan-service in proper places so the story won\u2019t get affected. Occasionally it uses different styles to make their content more effective, such as the eleventh episode. Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry ends up being a lot more entertaining than expected as its more focused on being unique rather than being typical. Its blend of well-directed action and light humor makes this one of the better anime this season.\\n\r\nPresentation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nThe cast of this character are what might at first seem typical and clich\u00e9, however they slowly start developing into something more. The protagonist of this anime, Kurogane Ikki, at first starts off as the typical, sword-wielding, underestimated badass who is surrounded by attractive girls, however he\u2019s very well developed as a character, and his backstory was really well done as it was shown very stylishly. He doesn\u2019t act like a typical perverted character, which is something that can be seen in every other school anime, which is a nice change. The anime\u2019s other lead, Stella, does act very-clich\u00e9 like, especially when she ends up fantasizing about Ikki, however the anime develops her too as a proper character and the best part about her is how they developed her relationship with Ikki as more real than not. This is what separates Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry from the rest of the other harems, as it is mainly a romance. Ikki\u2019s sister, Shizuku is an interesting character too and they show how much she cares for her brother and for what reason, however it is a shame that they didn\u2019t focus on that too much. Alice is an interesting character too, and luckily they didn\u2019t make his sexuality the butt of the joke all the time. Unfortunately he doesn\u2019t do too much for the plot. There are other characters too, however they don\u2019t play much of a major role.\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nSilver Link does a fine job with the art in Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry. The color usage is great as it looks bright and vivid. However it looks unique too compared to other anime of the same genre. The art style reminds me of the art style used in Oregairu Season Two; a more bleached out look, with a sort of transparent feel to it. It works great in this anime. The backgrounds are well done too. This is really good considering Silver Link had two other anime to work with too (luckily they get to take a break next season!). The character design is also great. Ikki, though typical looking, looks pleasingly good. Stella was clearly designed to be waifu material (I\u2019m not complaining though\u2026). The arena design in the festival is also quite nice. The anime also uses many different art styles, such as when they use greyish-black and red as their only colors (the art style used in the OP).\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nSilver Link delivers in its animation as much as they did for the art. Everything is smooth and clear. The fight scenes in particular is really well animated. The use of slow-motion is some fights is really well done as it looks really gorgeous when it is combined with its art style. The rotating camera works at times, but sometimes it looks a little messy. One particular distraction was when the camera shows the entire arena, then zooms onto a character in there. The depth between the character and the background isn\u2019t consistent throughout the zooming. Not to mention the art gets less detail too. However that is my only flaw with its near perfect animations. \\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast does a good job with the voice acting in Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry. Osaka Ryota, who does Ikki, does a good job with his role, even if it is nothing special. The voice for Ikki feels like the same voice I\u2019ve heard in every other anime of the same genre. Ishigami Shizuka, who does Stella, does it in a fine job. She manages to give Stella a sensuous, yet powerful voice. However it\u2019s nothing too, too, special. Touyama Nao however, does a fantastic job with Shizuku, as she as able to make her into a character who says \u201conii-sama\u201d, without being annoying by is over abundance of \u201cmoe\u201d. She makes the little sister character a strong, independent and caring character. Asanuma Shintaro does an alright job with Alice, however he doesn\u2019t really have much to do as most of his lines are supposed to be said in the same tone, as he is shown to be the character with wisdom.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe OP, \u201cIdentity\u201d, is really, really good. The first time when I heard it, I totally got addicted. And the mixture of the greyish-black and red filtering made this OP stand out even more. The ED, \u201cHaramitsu Renka\u201d feels chilling and haunting with its fantastic vocals. Also both the OP and ED feel like they totally go perfectly with this anime. The OST and background music is pretty good. Most of the fights have OST I would hear in Sword Art Online, and by no means is that a wrong thing, as it\u2019s more of a compliment than anything. It used compositions that don\u2019t rely on harder beat, but rather softer ones with a faster rhythm. The music helps in making the fights better than it is. \\n\r\nMusic: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nRakudai Kishi no Cavalry ended up being a surprise for me, as I never expected it to try to be unique after watching the first couple of episodes. It knows that it\u2019s a romance, not a harem, when to place its fan-service, and how to create proper character development for the two main characters. Its fan-service is quite enjoyable (and lewd), and the actions scenes are really, really good, especially when combined with its unique style. When an anime leaves be craving for a second season, I know it was an anime I really enjoyed.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is a surprise from the list of anime this season. Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry easily is one of those anime that can\u2019t be judged by its promotional art and PVs as it is much more than a clich\u00e9, typical, ecchi, fantasy-school anime. It manages it incorporated its own unique style and manages to create character development for the two main characters, which other anime unfortunately fail to do. Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry may not be for everyone, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to try it out.\\n\\n\r\n+ Quickly diverges into a different route, one with minimal clich\u00e9s.\\n\r\n+ Great character development and relationship for the two leads.\\n\r\n+ Great art and animations, especially during fights.\\n\r\n+ Great OST usage and awesome OP and ED.\\n\r\n- The plot is still a little too simplistic. \\n\r\n- Some supporting characters don\u2019t get enough focus.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.4/10",

            "content": "This is my first review, I would like to start off with how this aired at the same time as The Asterisk War. The story overall is the exact same but Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry was overall done better.\r\nStory: MC is attending a school to become a magical knight but he is an F rank with no talent. MC meets the princess (A rank), indecent things happen, duel, he wins. So on and so forth. Nothing special about the story. A good strong point to the story is that, they skip all of the BS that is seen in a typical harem and cut straightto the point.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The artwork is fairly well done, the scenes are done quite well. However there is nothing special about it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is what I found was a strong point, the characters were well done. The interactions weren't forced and the chemistry seemed natural. Also this show has a HUGE variation in characters from what is typically seen. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this show greatly, after the third episode, I was hooked. It is funny, it is enjoyable, the characters are great and when it ended, I wanted a second season. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you like harems and/or romance, this is should be on your list. It is well done, with good characters and none of the cliche BS that is seen. This is a show I recommend to my friends that like shows such as High School DXD, The Irregular at Magical High School.",

            "content": "Okay this was just a bland show.\r\nStory: where to start, ah, I the idea of the school is for magic weapon users and...I can't really think of anything  else to say. the plot is going for an underdog tale and how he shows that he is not a loser. I am usually all into these stories but the writers some how messed that up. nothing was really exciting for the characters did not feel interesting enough for me to care for. The 1st episode was just full of anime trops: waling in on senpai changing, tsundere getting mad about it, then the tsundere gettingred for the guy said something nice. I was just at aw of how that could happen so early. But wait there's more, after the 1st episode the MC (Ikki) and the main female lead (Stella) already have feelings for each other. The show felt rushed and under developed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nIkki: Our Hero, MC, Underdog, and a generic nice guy. He is okay but his power is so lazy. I swear it was just a an ability to copy someone else's ability, well to  a degree. This felt so cheap. He was not OP in anyway, just cheap. how he acts is bland and I was not sure what his goal was. He could have been much more if 1: his power was not \"Copy and Paste\" and 2: if he had a real personality.\\n\\n\r\nStella: She was okay and could have been better. the show never gives any real background on her which is strange. she gets her butt kicked in the 1st episode by Ikki like it was nothing. She was assumed to be strong but due to a cheap shot she was made to look  like a weakling. her romance with Ikki was just sad. it was not handled well.  \\n\\n\r\nEveryone Else: Meh. Ikki and Stella's main friends consisted of some feminine guy and Ikki's sister who had a brother complex (the bad one).",

            "content": "During the fall anime season I had been watching an anime that had a great soundtrack, not very good action scenes, hundreds of Cliche's and I just only enjoyed 50 percent of each episode and that anime was.........The Asterisk war.\r\nI had than started watching a series known as The Asterisk war sucks by Digibro on youtube. Around the 12th part he introduced an anime the was extremely similar except it was good. After he summarized the first 4 episodes, I went to watch Chivalry of a failed knight. \r\nThis anime doesn't have a lot of things new, but it is highly note worthy that thisanime is not a harem, which I hate most harems. The anime has a definitive relationship and likable characters. It is true that the main character Ikki's design is nothing new, which can have him labeled as like everyone else. He does have a personality and character though. \\n\\n\r\nI liked all the other characters too, even if during the second story arc, Shizuku and Stella's bickering got a bit annoying. The anime also has really amazing voice acting, and it would be really hard to dub this show well, which is why I'd of liked if it was licensed by funimation and not sentai Filmworks, I'll still be picking up the blu-ray when it comes out though.\\n\\n\r\nNow I would like to say that I don't care THAT much about Cliche's, as long as they're done well and I am enjoying myself. So if you're still reading this novel I'm writing, you probably have the idea that, yes, I did enjoy myself. I enjoyed a majority of what this show had to offer, except for the fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice in Chivalry of a failed knight can be very distasteful. It can be kind of funny at times and tolerable, because of plot reasons, at points. The anime didn't need some of this fanservice either, but it's there and who really cares. I can ignore the fanservice as long as that is not all we're getting. You know the answer.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art in the show ranges for servicable to awesome, mainly during fight scenes or one episode when it tried to do something interesting for the tone. I don't really have much to say about art style, as I usually do not notice that much about a show, I'm usually just a \"this is how a show looks, so I won't complain\", unless it's something like how Naruto's animation used to be really good, but as Shippuden progressed, it got worse.\\n\\n\r\nI also really enjoyed the music in this show, it helped with a lot of the awesome moments in the show. I really enjoyed the opening and really kind of skipped the ending, it's not that the song was necessarily bad, but I didn't care for the imagery and it didn't really fit the shows tone.\\n\\n\r\nSo should you watch this show, YES! I give it full recommendations to watch. If you wish to see it, it is on Hulu. If you live in a country that doesn't have Hulu, you know that there are other less legal options. I also would like it if there was a season 2, but I am willing to wait, because you have to put time and effort in to these things and not just spit out a season 2. Thank you for reading if you are among the few willing to go through these extremely long reviews.",

            "content": "Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry pleasantly surprised me...but only because I was able to make it through the first couple of episodes. I nearly dropped the show in the middle of the second episode: I'm not interested in watching an anime full of typical unrealistic tropes and \"anime\" situations (like our main character walking in on the female protagonist in a state of undress, and declaring that he too will strip, or his little sister greeting him with a kiss on the lips in the 2nd episode.). Thankfully Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry deviated away from that and focused on telling its story starting at about episode3.\\n\\n\r\nOnce it got rolling, the show gave me about what I expected. Ikki, the main character, is a good guy though at times a bit too \"pure\". Quite like a Knight sometimes actually. And when the romance finally did get going it was very cute, though I wish we could've gotten a little more in this regard. Still, it was quite enjoyable to watch most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe battles and the plot of the story were interesting enough to keep me watching. I was never really on the edge of my seat (the plot armor of the main character is about as subtle as an actual suit of armor), but I didn't hate watching the battles. I will say that the anime felt like it had too much for 12 episodes. I found myself thinking that several episodes could've been split into 2 episodes very easily. Particularly towards the end of the series it felt rushed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was a cute series. The romance was enjoyable, and the plot entertaining. There was nothing that blew me away about the series, and it was very predictable. I'd recommend this show if you are looking for something a bit on the lighter side and not too serious.",

            "content": "I normally hate light novel adaptations, I normally hate magic high school sword fighting academies, and I normally hate soft or hard harem anime. However, I enjoyed this show - enough to buy it on blu ray. \r\nThere are a handful of things that I took away from this show, and most of it has to do with how it avoids the usual trappings of the genre's tropes. It avoids DBZ-style power escalation by emphasizing skill and technique, leaving power and abilities to remain as simply character design aesthetic. It subverts the harem expectation in multiple ways; one of the non-spoiler ways being that notever girl inexplicably falls in love with the protagonist. (you still get your cast with plenty of ladies but without the dumb harem syndrome - best of both worlds!) Finally, the worldbuilding while not totally original was done in such a way that I actually want a second season. A guy like me wanting a second season featuring a magic high school sword fighting academy is a rare occurrence and is possibly the strongest indicator that this show is more than just passable despite its predictability.",

            "content": "It's pretty risky biznu trying to go against what people are calling an amazing anime, but boy did I not enjoy this show. \r\nI'd like to get the soundtrack and music out of the way first, because that's the easiest aspect of this show to dislike. The opening song straight out did not click with me; perhaps it's just not my type of music, but the singer gave me the impression of a cringe-inducing japanese comedy show host. The ending didn't fit the show's theme at all in my opinion, giving off a vibe for a horror or mystery anime, rather than that of amagic-academy battle royale-esque show. \\n\\n\r\nThe show boasts a lot of great animation.. When you actually get to see it. During the dedicated \"Battle of the episode\", the tournament rounds usually follow a pretty obnoxious cut-and-paste formula. \\n\\n\r\nOur main character Ikki enters the arena. Stella, Shizuku and Alice are all sitting in the crowd, discussing what Ikki's opponent will do. Ikki confronts his opponent, and either has his own inner monologue for quieter opponents, or will have a conversation with them that goes on a little too long. After they're done talking, the round starts; \"Let's Go Ahead\". Either Ikki or the Opponent rushes at him, usually in an irritatingly slow motion clip. Ikki begins his second inner monologue, \"What is the gimmick of this opponent?\" Cut to the crowd where Stella, Shizuku and Alice are sitting. Either Stella or Shizuku will ask Alice what the gimmick of the battle is, to which Alice will usually answer for them. Cut back to Ikki, who has already essentially figured out the battle gimmick, takes advantage of the knowledge he has; and then uses his OP Main Character ability to win the match. \\n\\n\r\nCongratulations, you've just experienced half, if not three quarters, of the show already by reading that one paragraph. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation of each battle progressively gets worse as the show goes on; boasting amazing, crisp and smooth movements that I was very impressed by in the first couple of episodes. After the first couple of episodes, however, the battles are filled up with annoying inner-monologues and side-commentary by the characters, as mentioned in the paragraph above. However, when the characters actually shut up for once in the episode, the animation can go either of two ways. Either the animation returns to the smooth and crisp style movement that I fell in love with originally, or it takes a turn for the worst and just settles for stationary characters running in front of speedlines, or extremely abundant slow-motion scenes that make the battle seem slower and more boring rather than dramatic or tense. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very empty, despite what I had heard about prior to actually watching the show. You have your classic overpowered main character with a relatively dark past, a red-haired princess tsundere archetype, a loli/little sister with a older brother complex, and the creepy, quite possibly homosexual, individual who acts as an 'all-knowing' plot convenience. The main \"antagonist\" of the show doesn't become apparent until the last small chunk of the show, leaving little room for development there. Speaking of development, there almost isn't any in the show. The characters are flat, as much as I hate to say it, even though the show breaks the harem stereotype by integrating an actual romance into the story. \\n\\n\r\nI won't go into detail regarding the previously mentioned romance, in fear that it might constitute as a spoiler, however I can safely say that it doesn't affect the character development or the story as much as I would have liked. Sure, having a romance in these types of shows is a pretty uncommon feat, however the relationship itself, disappointingly, managed to bore me. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is very basic for the usual 'Magical Sword Academy' genre. The main character and his redheaded sidekick manage to enter the school's suspiciously dangerous 'Battle Royale to the Death'. For personal reasons, Mr. MC cannot lose a single match, otherwise something detrimental will happen to his character development, whatever little he has of it. He encounters opponent after opponent, each with their own somewhat unique special ability. Most episodes, and I mean 9 out of 12, usually follow the battle formula mentioned above, and those take up most of the show's airtime. By the end of the show we see something that attempts to be an antagonist; and succeeds, to a degree. Really, the antagonist only appears so that the tragedy tag can be taped to the main character in a last stand attempt to give the story some depth, which it ultimately doesn't. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Section\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6 | The story is generic beyond belief, and doesn't really go anywhere due to the fact that almost every episode features a poorly executed battle segment with a little too much talking about the battle, and not the story progression.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6 | The art looks great, when the characters aren't really doing anything. When they jump into battle however, it fluctuates pretty heavily, for better or for worse. Battle animation either follows the path of lazy speedlines or obnoxous slowmotion for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 4 | The soundtrack essentially consists of one song played in different styles. I can't take the opening seriously, and I'm not sure what it is that irks me so. It might be that I burst out into laughter or cringe at the sound of the singer, or maybe it's the non-sensical Engrish. Either way, the opening song makes its way into the show for multiple scenes. For scenes trying to be romantic, dramatic or tragic, the opening song is slowed down and played on a piano. For particularly exciting battles the opening plays in its original form. Realistically, the lack of variety in music really makes it difficult for me to enjoy the soundtrack itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4 | The characters are generic: OPMC, Tsundere Redhead Princess, BigBroComplex Loli/Little Sister, All-Knowing Mysterious Roommate (Who also fills the category of potentially gay character)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5 | I would realistically only recommend this show to another person if they had already watched the good Action-Based Magical Academy shows I had already recommended to them (There are surprisingly a lot more than you would expect.) Did I enjoy it? No. Is it a bad show? Not exactly. I didn't enjoy the show because of my own personal opinions (Battles include too much talking, the story doesn't go anywhere, characters are bland, overhype of the show in general, etc.) However I can definitely see this show being enjoyed by someone who just wants to watch some ecchi fanservice with a little action on the side (Similar to the effect of Highschool DxD). As an action show, this anime isn't the best, but it's not unbearable. As a romance/comedy, it succeeds a little more than it does when it tries to fit into the action genre. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6 | It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as everybody had hyped it up to be. \\n",

            "content": "You know, I really tried hard to give this show a worse rating. But at the end I actually really liked it. Maybe it was from forcing myself to sit through the entirety of Sahkugan no Shana or Zero no Tsukaima, but I really do prefer a mature, honest, realistic relationship. Asterisk War...I mean Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is actually fairly fulfilling and I think it was test to see whether this one or the same show with different plot points would win this season. That being said, the small female characters that couldn't possibly hope to win a real sword fight at least hada water power or speed or something to back up their power. There was a decent amount of realism with blood and such, and for a high school magic anime it wasn't half bad. It set out to do something, and it accomplished it, and left me wanting to see whether Kurogane can compete in the battle fest while still protecting his gf and sister. It was interesting to see the black and white art style used to freshen up an anime and give some life to the story. Being a long term martial artist I appreciated the backstory of Kurogane and felt that they actually tried to stop him without having some joke of a way to do it that would be easily foiled, and it didn't turn out that his dad was actually doing all this for his sake or something pitiful, he was actually a git and didn't want his power usurped. Anyways, I think I'd rather watch this than Zero no Tsukaima again, so despite being a total ripoff of a story, it was good.",

Also, this will be my first ever review for an anime because this anime just deserves it.\r\nhave you ever hated dense male leads who are literally oblivious to romance and want to slap the hell out of them? have you ever hated female leads who are untruthful with their hearts? well this anime is the cliche breaker.\r\nStory : 7\r\nrakudai is like every other OP main characters who is looked upon as being weak but instead has immense power. BUT themain point of this anime isnt the action, but the romance.\\n\\n\r\nholy SHIT does this anime does romance right. the romance progression is 10/10 rivaling that of chick flick romance animes, heck even better than most of them. the ending is one of the most satisfying ending to a romance anime i have EVER seen.\\n\\n\r\nif you're someone like me who wants to see a romance ACTUALLY GOING SOMEWHERE, then this is the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nart : 8\\n\\n\r\nactually very good, especially the OP and some fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nsound : 8\\n\\n\r\nthe Op is very enjoyable, nothing too epic though.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter : 8 \\n\\n\r\nthe main character has got to be the MOST chivalrous man i have EVER seen. god damn and he even got the BALLS to go with it. 10/10 for ikki. stella was ok too. the other characters were meh.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10\\n\\n\r\nthis is what i want every single action anime to be like.

            "content": "Let me get this clear: My rating of 6 does not mean that this anime is bad, only that it could've been much more than it is. To me, 5-6 is mediocre. It could have been better, but it doesn't do horribly bad either. 5-6 is my example of an average anime. In a lot of anime reviews of MyAnimeList, I seem to think that a lot of reviewers regard a 5 as a bad score. My point with this lengthy introduction is that my mindset is different from most reviewers who think like the above, so when you read this, keep this in mind.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was a refresher for light novel anime watchers like me. Many light novels anime adaptions are really bad, like Asterisk War and SAO. Although this light novel isn't that much better, it still sets itself off from SAO and Asterisk War. The romance that was set in the anime is realized waaay earlier than expected, making the harem end much earlier. There are also little things, like the characters reacting in a realistic way to an embarrassing or outrageous event, or even the visuals that completely flesh out a dangerous situation. \\n\\n\r\nStory 5/10\\n\r\nThe story is very generic. It has the main character, with zero magical ability, fight in selection matches to get in a big event, in order to graduate. I've seen many plots like this, and in this one the story is executed in a passable way. It really isn't anything special.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nThe visuals were very average, with the exceptions of the last few episodes. Without spoiling too much, the main character is undergoing a gigantic hardship. The visuals portray this very well, and it really set the mood for the situation. This visual change is the main reason art is 7/10 and not a 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 \\n\r\nThe OP was nicely done. I liked alot of the music of this anime. From the happy and quirky pieces that were cheerful, to the tense pieces that made your heart beat fast, the music influenced alot to the emotions that I experienced while watching this anime. Loved it all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\r\nThere's the pink haired tsundere princess, the sister who's smitten to the main guy lead, and the cross boy girl mother figure?! This cast of characters isn't all that special, maybe except the cross boy girl, but the way they were executed made them into actually decent characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime more than I thought I would've. The fight scenes were well animated (for the most part), the fanservice was not forced, like the Asterisk War, and overall, even though I cringed at the \"I like boobs.\", and other scenes and lines, overall this was a good watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\nThis anime is better than some light novel anime adaptions, but still has alot of problems. It has assets over other anime, but it isn't able to override the many issues this anime has.",

It was actually good! Not higher because I still did predict a thing or two.\r\nART - 10\r\nI don't usually really talk about art as a big thing, but when I can say that this anime generally looks better than half the shit that airs, you know new heights arereached.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 8\\n\\n\r\nWhile the sound is good, I still didn't like everything it offered. It's high quality, isn't some boring repetitive BS that I can spit on every day, and the voice acting is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 8\\n\\n\r\nWhile they are the part that stands out the most, it's only 8 because harem, and I still dislike that part.

It's not really ERASED or Stein's;gate, but it's definitely great.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 9\\n\\n\r\nAs you might have noticed, I actually enjoyed this.

            "content": "Personally, after watching any enjoyable anime series, I like to non-critically analyze the overall mood of the anime. What I mean is I tend to not concern myself too much with the actual assessment of the components of the anime, but moreover of what I feel in the moment. This tends to make many of my anime scores different from the expected score of the average viewer. Rakudai Kishini no Cavalry is definetly one of those cases.\r\nFor starters, I'd like to assess the overall setting of the story. Being that the plot takes place in a magical high school where students battle each other usingweapons generated by scientific devices, this premise seems extremely generic, despite it being as specific as it is. This is why originally, I had dropped the show while it was airing, and I was relatively heisitant to pick it up again, because I had nothing better to do over winter break. However, Rakudai in particular decided to borrow a character archetype that was not common among this specific sub genre. In this anime, despite the main character's lack of a quantifiable amount of ability, he manages to be quite competent in his own way of fighting. This breaks the general mold of character archetypes which usually contain something along the lines of an overpowered character, or a completely underpowered character.\\n\\n\r\nBy establishing something in between the two common general character archetypes, Rakudai manages to leave room for development while still containing a solid base used as distinctive characterization. This also allows the juxtaposition a new character archetype into an anime setting that the anime community is already very accustomed to, leading to a branching path of plot possibilities.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as my personal opinion of the visuals of the anime go, I'd have to say that they're relatively expected for this day and age. The anime has plenty of brilliant, flashy fight scenes, but it also captures a very light mood overall at the beginning (I'll refer back to this mood later). However, the same can't be said about the music. The music by itself is relatively good, but in my opinion, the anime doesn't have too much of what I like to call \"melodic continuity\". Even though I'm an orchestral musician who has studied violin, viola, and piano for many years, I can't honestly say that I remember too many of the themes, and that the themes themselves didn't pack any continuity. Looking back at the anime, I don't know if it's simply that there were not enough prevalence in the melodies themselves, or if it was that the soundtracks were just used incorrectly in terms of timing and execution, leading to no real connection with the plot.\\n\\n\r\nNow the predominant reason why I have such a high assessment of Rakudai is the fact that this anime really switches up the mood towards the end of the show which is something I personally like to see. As a combination of both the writing, art, and music, Rakudai breaks apart from its casual mode and becomes something of a serious matter, showing the consequences of social boundaries and the lack of talent  in the world of this anime. Given the sudden change in mood, it allows the viewer to take a second and really root for the protagonist, as if the future is uncertain for an ability he can't change. It pits the two primary contrasting themes of the show (which just for the record, was only established and not really reinforced before the end of the show) of hard work versus natural talent against each other, giving the viewer an actual possibility of doubt. Given the short run time of the anime, the change in both the tempo of the plot, and the stylistic changes to the thematic focus really crafts an enjoyable show to watch up until the very end.",

The only thing that I disliked is that in certain episodes new art styles are used in certain situations where they were never used before, skill activation for instance and it doesn't seem to serve any purpose other than to highlight the intensity of the situation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nRead the wikipedia entry, I've already wrote what I thought of the main characters in the opening paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nHonestly this is the least memorable aspect of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/overall:\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching a lot of ecchi/harem animes with the spineless male and bitchy ultra violent tsundere archetype this was a breath of fresh air. I went into this series with low expectations and they were blown out of the water. If you were planning on skipping over this one I'd recommend checking it out if you enjoy romance and are tired of the typical ecchi/harem tropes.",

            "content": "Hey folks, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is a battle harem that is slightly better than the others that have come out this season. It's a better version of Gakusen Toshi Asterisk but a worse version of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei.  \r\n    Our story begins with the start of a school year and our male MC(Ikki Kurogane) is walking into his room, alas what does he find in his room? What many of us would like to find, a pretty girl, with the added bonus that she is changing clothes. Sounds familiar to Asterisk? Of course the girlis the female MC(Stella Vermillion), and she is indeed a fire wielding Tsundere. Now our male MC is much better at presenting a more like able personality here so he gains a few points, though the end result is the same that these two characters must duel to decide who gets to make the rules for the room. Ikki is the weakest student in the school supposedly with no magical talent, whereas Stella is one of the more strong first years with incredible magical power. Ikki however wins the duel by using his \"Non-magical ability\" which allows him to go past his own ability for a short amount of time, and wins the rights to the room.\\n\\n\r\n    Having picked this up right after Asterisk, I found it amusing that it started in almost identical manners. I however decided that Ikki had won me over with his quick decision to also take off his clothes to make things even for seeing Stella changing. The story goes on and we learn about the school, what this magic ability really is and more importantly what Ikki must do to graduate. We don't get much in the way of world development and have little knowledge of the school, the people that run the school and the magical community on the outside and what it means to be a magical knight. This didn't really affect the show however, it was clear early on that the rest of the world didn't matter and we were only here to watch to see if Ikki could graduate. The shows pacing was ok, though a little fast and shallow. We do get to see a decent amount of character development and the relationship, though quickly formed, seemed reasonably well thought out.\\n\\n\r\n    The latter half of the series went by much the same as the first though the last two episodes almost went and shattered the more relaxed former episodes work by being more serious. The ending was a little anti climatic however the relationship that in many harems seems to never complete, managed to end in a satisfying way. A second season would be welcome and I would like to see more of the other characters and the world that these so called magic knights are training to enter.\\n\\n\r\n    The characters are fairly well done. There isn't many, but the ones that are in the story all have solid personalities rooted in a backstory. There isn't many cringy situations, and the situations that are more hit or miss with people like the incest connotations are well spoken and have a backstory that other anime don't include. I would have liked a more diverse list of characters or at least more camera time for the ones that are in the story because Ikki and Stella take most of the show. Ikki basically is Tatsuya from Rettousei(Though IMO not as cool. I'm a fan of our lord Shiba Tatsuya). He is at the bottom of the school because of the way that he was being scored. Stella is one of the better Tsundere's, though this is because shes more Dere and less Tsun and this again is to my preference.  \\n\\n\r\n    The art is fine, pretty standard for this season of anime. The fight scenes were well done and the effects for each magic ability were pretty cool and interesting. The sound effects were fitting. The music at the end was pretty good, Asterisk however wins out here.\\n\\n\r\n    Overall I really enjoyed the show. Didn't have a problem finishing all 12 episodes. It ended well enough even if it was a little anti climatic. The story built itself well, but it isn't a masterpiece. If your looking to find a decent harem this season give this one a shot. It deserves it more than the others I've watched recently.\\n",

Oh it tries a bit to differentiate itself, as with most of my friday nights it casts its mana leak only to then realize that your opponent has three mana open and so disappointment resolves and you continue the journey through the fall anime season\r\nWell then, where to begin. We start of in the only setting more generic than an average high school, an average magical high school. As with most magical high schools in the fantastical land of horny teens common sense is athing of the past and adults just want to make children have sex. Because of this some guy you don't really care about gets put into a room with some girl you''ll inevitably hate. Then the plot meanders a bit with generic plot points as far as the eye can see until it decides that its finally time to reveal this anime's true form. As it reveals this plot point your eyes shine for a bit and a smile gets put on your face only to then realize that the female simply got moved from one annoying stereotype to another and in the end the only change was to your enjoyment of the show which you already thought couldn't get any lower. As you realize whats going on you ask the anime, \"what now\" and the anime responds with \"I haven't thought this far ahead, however we have tits\" you pause, assess your situation and realize eh your already 6 episodes in and your parents already waked in on you masturbating to lezbian cat girls do you rly have that much left to lose. No, no you don't so you finish and spend 10 minutes ranting about it on the internet for 5 people to see, 4 of which have already watched it and came to have their opinions reconfirmed because they saw a 10 ... what was I talking bout again. Right this anime is generic shit, and shouldn't fool you.\\n\\n\r\nArt is generic although ill give credit where credit is due and say that some of the fight scenes that weren't monologues disguised as fight scenes were actually decently done. However with most anime like this one, the fight scenes try to fool you into thinking something is happening by having the characters shout out whats happening to maybe let you imagine something more interesting since there's nothing to really watch as they used most of their budget on the main female characters tits. \\n\\n\r\nSound is there i guess \\n\\n\r\nThis anime has one thing it tries to do to differentiate itself however its unfortunately trying to put a my little pony band aid over a regular one which unfortunately doesn't do much for your lack of dignity after you're parents walked in on you masturbating to the scene from your doushinji of Ikki bukkakaing all over his sisters face, which for the record would probably have a better plot than this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThats why overall i give this anime a 10 for the amount of times i cut myself watching it",

            "content": "First off I definitely did not expect Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry t be this good. Just judging by the little I had read and the way it seemed it was going to go. I expected the usual new battle/harem/romance anime. Which usually consists of great art, good music,good fight animations and a weak to average story with normally average charries......I was wrong\r\nIt delivered in all the areas that I was already expecting with great art and fights. It then however came through with a pretty darn good story/backstory as well as very good and likable charries even the sides. Even fairly original and un commonwith Alice. Of course some things where shortened and so on but you can really tell how well written the story is from the light novels. The backstory and all of the charries storys is where it really shines. Looking at the plot bio you would think it's going to be a typical battle tourny anime but it's not.  I love though that while being different and having a much better written story and more in depth than the usual type from this genre it still also delivered on all the points you would be expecting from the usual ones. It also surprisingly does a better job with the romance aspect than even most \"romance\" anime do. It's not to obviously rushed and the mcs relationship actually progresses instead of having awkward nothings happen all show then the last episode maybe having a confession or kiss.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really like to rate anime on very technical aspects. I like to go more by how much I enjoyed and got into them but I will touch on some things briefly. Obviously with most newer anime unless your just into the very old anime art styles the art is great and the battle animations are very well done. The music is solid through out and is great in episode 12. Something it done fairly well that is a huge thing most anime fail at these days was pacing. If you want to be very picky you could say it was a slight bit rushed maybe but honestly it's very well paced for a 12 episode battle anime with all that it covered and covered pretty well. I also enjoyed this anime alot. To my surprise I enjoyed it more than I have an anime in a while especially of this genre.  \\n\\n\r\nIf there is one bad point for Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry though I would have to say there is a bit to much fan service. I am not one for it and really could do without it period so that may be just me but if I had to pick at something that is it. It's not to bad but there are points where it seemed a bit to much to me though even with this being someone who dislikes fan service it was down in a sort of cute way and a big thing with me a way that didn't break story or make the charries seem stupid/to pervy/out of character. Also obviously with the show being made from a light novel series the ending leaves alot of things your going to want to see. It doesn't end badly however just leaves you wanting more which is the point I suppose being that most of these anime are made to promote source materiel and they did that very well. I haven't even touched the light novels and can pretty much see an idea of where it goes from where the anime left off and would love to see it. Just kind of annoying for those anime watchers out there who don't also read light novels. There usually isn't a season 2 for this sort of promotion anime but hopefully there will be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry a 8.5 and could easily give it a 9 if they laid off the fan service just a bit. I would also probably go up a bit if the way they did the ending wasn't so obvious that it was made pretty much solely to promote the light novels. I get it and understand but being someone that is not really into lns and mainly being into anime it get's a bit frustrating knowing all this anime are pretty much made with intent in mind of having no second season unless it just completely blows up like an SAO or Tokyo Ghoul  and was just made to get Japanese to buy the lns. Being an american anime fan really is s struggle sometimes lololol. Definitely recommend watching though!  \\n\\n",

I liked that the main character was only slightly shy around the female main character so the romance element developed nicely. The action sequences were really cool to watch as well. However, I don't think they made his father look as evil as he actually was. I feel they should have had a few more bit scenes scattered in the start of the series to show how disgusting Ikki's family was in the present, not only the past. Overall, it was a fantastic magical school battle royal type animewith a well-done romance element. While I wish there could be a season 2, not all anime that is greeted well in the west is popular back in Japan. As the sales were poor, this is the only season. That being said, I do not feel the ending to the first and only season was rushed. I also feel they did a great job bringing Ikki's story to a fitting close. It's definitely worth a watch.",

Let's say that at least here in underwear, then we see a protagonist who suffers a lot over time, although a good amount of animes the protagonists have Power-Ups , here the protagonist is not very different, but he has enough to bewell characterized\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt  9/10: The artistic section, like most of the anime of Light Novels, is quite beautiful, what I usually admire more than this kind of drawing, is the well done and the details that are taken with the characters, I can really be considered a fan of the LN, something that is well noticed that made the animation studio of this Anime, is that he knew how to adapt well the drawing of this, perhaps, improving it a little more than what was the LN, I am a person which takes the Art of anime, as important as its history\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: What can I say ... For what I put the \"7\" is because something that I liked a lot, were the Opening and Ending, also the last song made by the singer of the Opening. The Opening I felt sensational, it combined perfectly with the Anime story, and the Ending, it was good, but sincerely, the background music, the Soundtrack could not be heard, and it leaves a bit to think about that aspect ... ( Maybe because the story is more interesting than the Soundtrack itself)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:The Anime is good, maybe, one of the best in its premiere season, providing plenty of comic moments, such as feelings of sadness for the protagonist throughout the Anime, because it is so, Ikki seemed a trashy character from the beginning, leaving him to Stella and her Sister as the best of the Anime, but as she progresses, she begins to have some affection for the fact that she suffered and continues to suffer as she advances.\\n\r\nI just looked like a character that I did not like much Arisuin, but his relationship with the girls, implied that he was a rare character and perhaps unique in his species, which leaves in doubt whether he is a good character or not.\\n\r\nRegarding the Ecchi, be Anime a lot has not, it is not those Animes where the protagonist falls on the girls, or do perverted things, and enjoy the improvement of the relationship of Ikki Kurogane and Stella Vermillion throughout the Anime , even though their relationship was just too fast, but it is common in this class of Animes\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: If you are looking for a different Anime, with a good protagonist and a different Romance, then Rakudai Kishi No Cavalry is for you, yes, for Ecchi lovers, Rakudai Kishi No Cavalry only has something with Stella, but despite that, he does not abuse that much, therefore in that aspect they will not be able to appreciate him, maybe in some scene in episode 2 and 8-9, but not much more.\\n\r\nHowever, one of my favorite episodes was the 10th, without a doubt, in fact, the last half of the Anime was what I liked the most, it was where the plot was best taken, Stella Vermillion, Ikki Kurogane and Shizuku Kurogane were really very good characters.\\n\r\nThe Anime has romance, a Stella Vemrillion Tsundere like most of the girls in the Anime, but who knew how to differentiate a little, with comical and sad moments, which makes it a good Anime.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n",

I'm kind of a sucker for any anime that gives me some feels. I think they handled it in 12 ep really well. It didn't feel that rushed, but I wish it was longer to expand on some arcs. Good VAs too. Even ifyou are a dub tard watch this subbed.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaints are some fan service panty shots that kill my immersion, and a hamfisted LGBTWTFBBQ that just felt like nothing more than virtue signalling.

            "content": "TL;DR: Cute story of two fighters of completely different worlds falling in love in quite a dorky way, all while fighting their way to the top.\r\nAt first, especially since it's considered Ecchi, I was expecting more of nonsensical fanservice and instead got positively surprised. Apart from a certain bathroom scene quite early on, which seemed pretty out of every context, it actually did not try to shove boobs and ass up your face every time a female character is on screen.\r\nThe story itself is pretty straight forward, as the whole setting already makes it feel like there will be a happy end, so you expectboth of the main protagonists to keep their promise and make it to the top. But then again, you can't expect a 12 episode show with mainly action and romantic aspect to deliver a deep story and covering it decently. The story may be simple, but it is consistent and well put together.\\n\\n\r\nYou actually get to learn the backstory of the different characters (not so much for Stella though, mostly through relatively short flashbacks), which gives them a decent enough depth (combined with their actions and dialogues) in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes were surprisingly nice, and also made up quite a lot of the series, the other main aspect was the romance developing between Stella and Ikki. At first, it seemed more like a \"girl with a crazy crush for some dude\" kind of thing, but it actually developed in a pretty cute relationship, which also got nicely rounded off at the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nLike Action & Romance? Go for it!",

            "content": "Story: 8/10\r\nFirst of all, in the beginning, the story might seems like the general type of magical school harem with ecchi. It's true that have ecchi and a few scenes with fanservice, but it isn't the general harem like in many others, because the male lead acts as a real male lead. The story is a very good one, Every character has a story from him/her. And if you like the style of action and romance then I can say that this is the best one in this style, mainlly, because the fact that there is real romance and one part of the history focuson that. The story, in general, is divide in arcs, this anime focus on the qualifiers from the main magicl tournament that happens latter on the novel. This anime adptation was more to introduce the characters and the main plot. \\n\r\nSumming up: It's a story about magical school that focus on the fights between the students.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is good, but the animation no so much. In the fight scenes the animation is very good, but in the normal scenes the level decreases. The opening animation is a bit different, but I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe sound is good too, mainly the sounds during the fights increases its tension, but could be better. The opening and ending song are cool. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacther: 9/10\\n\r\nOk, the characters are the best part of story, unfortunately not all the characters storys were explained. The male lead is a very different from the typical harem protagonist that does nothing with the girls, this MC is the opposite of them, but remember this is not a harem anime. \\n\r\nThe main error of this part was that the plot behind the main heroine was not explained.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOk, I rated this with a 10/10, because I love the style of action and romance anime, and in Rakudai Kishi we have good fights and excellent romance between the characters. I enjoyed all the episodes. In every 4 episodes the enemy changes, consequently the type of fight changes too, I could not wait to see the next one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIf you are looking for an anime with the style of magical school, or with action and romance, you really should take a look on this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I thought this anime was great! The characters are some of my favorite. Ikki has to be one of the all time sweetest guys. He is genuinely a good person who would do anything for those around him. I'm usually more of a fan of the bad guys but Ikki really does take the good guy cake. He starts at the very bottom and attempts to reach the top solely via hard work and determination. In his case, many would just sit back and live an easy life but not Ikki. He is actually a really good role model. Where are the guys like himin real life??\\n\r\n I also really liked Stella. At first, I thought she was loud and just annoying but the more I got to know about her, the more I was able to appreciate her personality. Her life has been the complete opposite of Ikki's. Stella has an incredible amount of raw power and is able to easily defeat her opponents through brute strength. \\n\r\nI loved the art. I found the color saturation to be beautiful with all of the pinks and blues. This may seem silly but I am a tad bit obsessed with the character's hair colors. It's kind of a reverse ombre with a lighter color at the top turning into a deeper color at the bottom. It's some of the prettiest anime hair that I've ever seen. \\n\r\nI hope there will be a second season!",

            "content": "Hello, you! The one, wondering 'Is that anime any good'? Well absolutely. I heard for this anime a while ago, in a video recommendation. If I remember right, they said \"Although it is kinda imitation, it has a good moments\".  Nothing close to this. \r\nStory 10/10: While this score may be surprising it has a reason. You might say: Well, but its about school tournament, about a main character who goes around, having hard time, and winning. And you will be right. But this statement will be exactly as someone saying for your favorite anime or book: Its just pixels (or letters). The emotionsbehind the story are extraordinary. The whole story feels solid, filled with reason, purpose. Its a really good mix of romance, comedy and action. I havent met an anime like this in a long while. Well, the battles arent as those in One Piece, or Fairy Tail, HxH, just a cut bellow, but thats what you can expect from 12 episode anime. They gave me the same thrill, excitement and sitting-on-the-edge filling. The comedy is not some mainstream cliche bullshit, but instead something that can really make you laugh. The anime is not harem. I could say, that would be in my top 5, no 3, romances. It had one of the most sweet, uninterrupted and non harem moments, which are modern now. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10. The art... it was awesome. It wasnt something I'd notice, it fit perfectly the anime. It features some pretty bad-ass fights, cute girls with bikini and characters. Like who wouldnt like the Sword Eater? Also something worth to note: The ecchi in this anime, is not what you get in ecchi animes - like boobs all over the place, everywhere and thrown at your face at any time. It is done masterfully, just the right bit, not to annoy you, but to impress you, or make you laugh. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10. Same as the art. Although it isnt like I'd get impressed with a song, and try to find it and listen it every now and then, but it fit the setting really good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10. The anime develops the characters pretty well in my opinion. It really shows their feelings, and makes them reasonable. Its not like we have seen in some shit animes: there is a conflict, this is it, let the character cry a bit - done. It actually digs in it, its not straightforward.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10. All I need to say is, that I have watched this show in like 4 hours. It was awesome. Like I feel I had really good time. That I have watched in all times. I had those cute moments, laughter, despair (you know, when you want just to turn off the show or skip it) and epicness. I feel there is nothing more I could have wanted.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10. This show is as the main character itself. Its not 'born' with some really great setting, or original plot idea. Its all how it was executed. Perfectly. It was a perfect mixture of what you'd want, the right amount of everything. As I said: Cute romance moments (not annoyingly interrupted, that make you wanna crash the screen), great humor and ecchi even. Achieving the balance, that make you breeze over the show, while trembling with excitement  is what makes an anime a masterpiece. And this is indeed one. Thanks for reading & hopefully enjoyable watching!",

The same can be said about the insest girl.

SPOILERS AHEAD!\r\nStory 10/10: The story is incredible! The way they played it out as the male lead was hated by his family because he couldn't use powers and so on made it an incredible andheart wrenching story that hit me right in the feelings!

This anime made me come back just for the sound/music of it. I absolutely love hearing the theme song and I constantly sing it. The music for the anime was just perfect!!! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: I'm a big soppy guy for a character who is hated by his family and has to work hard to get to the top and prove his family wrong. All though I would of loved to see him get accepted by his family and to go on with that, would of been amazing. I think it still went in the right direction with it all together. The main character fitted perfectly into this and made it so much more sadder to see him have to go through so much just to be accepted. TRULY A MASTERPIECE!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Thoroughly enjoyed this and would recommended into everyone who is looking for a sad yet amazing story line that will make even the manliest of men cry!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Such a great series and needs a second season and even more based around the tournament!
