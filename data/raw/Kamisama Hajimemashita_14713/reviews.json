Everything is perfectly combined and thus great romance and comedy has been created.\r\nNanami may call herself super lucky considering her life before meeting Mikage. Now, treated like a goddess (which she became), her familiar cooks, cleans, makes appointments, has great manners, takescare about lots of things and is extremely handsome and powerful \u2013 how not to fall in love?\\n\\n\r\nThe romance grows with each episode. You can\u2019t wait to see what will happen next. There are a lot of obstacles on the way. We do not get to know or see everything of the characters past, but it is still enough to understand it in the context and wish for more\u2026 \uf04a\\n\r\nI highly recommend it to all who like to watch romance genre from time to time.",

            "content": "Ah kamisama, why doesn't money grow on trees especially when I'm in debt?\r\nAh kamisama, where are you when I need you the most?\r\nAh kamisama, why can't the world be perfect?\r\nIn a nutshell, Kamisama Hajimemashita (also known as Kamisama Kiss) is based on the manga of the same name written by Julietta Suzuki. She is known for several other lighthearted shoujo manga that involves supernatural elements such as Karakuri Odette. The series debuted in Fall of 2012 along with many other shuojo titles. \r\nThe series tells the story of a young girl named Nanami Momozono, who is alone..abandoned, and helpless. The innocent little lamp makes aninteresting encounter with a strange man (Mikagi) and from there, her life changes forever. But wait, it doesn't stop there. She also encounters the big bad wolf (or rather familiar) Tomoe. Along with him comes the package of two other spirits (Onikiri and Kotetsu). After a contract sealed by a kiss, the two forms as peculiar relationship. This series details their relationship and what's to come from it because the world is never fair. It's not perfect.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, this series is quite a strange one if you look on the surface. We have a normal human with no experience of the supernatural in a strange relationship with strange being with strange ears and a strange personality. Did I mention strange? \\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Nanami and Tomoe is one of the most strange, amusing, and interesting part of the series. A human and a familiar relationship has trouble written all over it especially the gap of difference between the two. Nanami is a normal human girl who has normal skills in life with normal friends attending a normal school. On the other hand, Tomoe is a supernatural being with supernatural abilities and able to accomplish feats with supernatural degrees. \\n\\n\r\nThis is like trying to get a cobra and mongoose to be best friends...\\n\\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Tomoe is very frustrated at Nanami's lack of progress in what she's trying to become and adjusting with her new life. He becomes increasingly annoyed at home, at school, and almost whenever he's around with Nanami, or precisely whenever he feels nothing is getting done. This example can be seen early in the series as result of Nanami's lack of progress with her new responsibilities. Yet at various times, there are sweet and tender moments where Tomoe feels empathy, care, and even jealousy for her. Wait a minute..is that a male tsundere I see in Tomoe?? \\n\\n\r\nBeing a shoujo series adapted from a shoujo manga, expect shoujo themes and elements. That typically transits in to the romance part of Kamisama Kiss. Even from the second word of the title and the pilot episode, one can expect romance in it. It's not one of those love at first sights though or a helpless crush but rather a strange one to say the least. To add to the mix, there are other characters such as the highly popular idol at school Shinjirou Kuram. He's the narcasstic type who causes trouble and tension between the duo but at the same time can be a fun guy to get to know with. There are other characters who occasionally adds in their own spotlights to the series as well such as the snake familiar Mizuki, Nanami's friend Mei, and later on a more dramatic entry of Ryuuou.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is overall quite lighthearted. There is virtually no fan-service except \u201cmaybe\u201d the beach episode in the latter half. It's more of a series where its comedy outshines its romance aspects especially the strange relationship between Nanami and Tomoe. Other characters adds in the comedy even during scenes where action is presented. So, if you're looking for some serious mindfuck, ecchi fan-service, or a dynamic story exploring serious themes, then you might be disappointed. Still though, the romance part does begin to blossom later on in the series especially after a pleasant date (maybe not entirely for Tomoe) and some tender moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the series is lighthearted as well. The art seems to be a bit pale and plain at most times that reflects the nature of this shoujo series. Most of Julietta Suzuki's artwork balances between romance and comedy and that is presented in Kamisama Kiss as well. The series focuses more on the characters rather than anything else with its artwork thus it's just ordinary; nothing too special to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and music applies here as well of being lighthearted. There is no intense or techno music rhythm even during some of the more dramatic and action scenes. Kurama's entry is often accompanied by his own soundtrack theme that brings out the inner fan girls at school so in some ways, it can be considered a little rock on added to the mix. The OP and ED songs are also lighthearted with one half of the title \u201cKamisama\u201d being echoed for the latter. Once again, it seems to just be in the background with a pleasant melody rather than anything special.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found Kamisama Kiss to be a charming little gem but nothing too special. It doesn't shine much as the series is shoujo with lighthearted themes. It's not mainstream compared to a few of the other shoujo series in the industry today (especially this Fall Season of 2012). But what it does have is a relaxing way of presenting romance mixed with comedy especially with the strange duo of Nanami and Tomoe. It's one of those series where you can sit down, watch it, and then tell yourself \u201cwell, that was cute\u201d. And of course, cute is another word to describe Kamisama Kiss especially with the supernatural elements mixed in. Some of the episodes does seem a bit dry with a lack of flavor but it can still be a fun watch especially if you enjoy its shoujo themes.\\n",

            "content": "A young girl is abandoned by her father who owes money and is left to fend for herself. This sounds like it\u2019s an excuse for the parents to not care what happens to their child while strange things are around them. It\u2019s clich\u00e9 but I can\u2019t think of any other way they could have walked around this. The fact of the matter is that they had to get rid of the parents one way or another and they picked one of the two ways they could have done it. That or make them dead and have her an orphan but that one is used evenmore often then the person leaving their child. I only wonder where the mother is. Nanami is well\u2026 not my favorite heroine although she is actually rather strong willed. I don\u2019t like how she is always saying pretty much anything that\u2019s on her mind rather quick, sometimes she ends up going on these rants like one that I talk about later on. On the other hand, I love how sweet a spirit she is in that she wants to help anyone she comes in contact with. She has had a hard life so it would have been so easy to make her selfless like Honda from Fruits Basket but she isn\u2019t. She acts selfish many times though she never does it to get on someone\u2019s nerves (Unless it\u2019s Tomoe).\\n\\n\r\nWell, like normal romance, she is taken in by someone and falls in love with the person even if he is not of this world. It would be fine if this was a normal romance with the man being a human but in this case, we have a fox spirit who has a really bad temper at times. At first glance, I guess you could consider Tomoe a muli-personalitied demon. He will fix Nanami dinner after telling her he despises being her familiar; call her a idiot when he is trying to save her; and things similar of that nature. With all the whining he seems to do about her, you would think he would just up and quit when he got a chance, right? Well, that\u2019s what I thought when he was free of his duties at one part but then he reinstates his position as her familiar again. That is not a real spoiler as it happens really early in the show but it\u2019s a good example of just how split this guy is.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is a bit, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just a bit confusing. It\u2019s all images of her with a song about being a girl and just starting to be a girl? I\u2019m confused as to what the opening was supposed to do as they don\u2019t really do anything but show this young girl. It didn\u2019t fit the show at all making me want to skip it every time. Other then that, the animation and everything reminds me of a lot of other shows out there with a supernatural spoof. It\u2019s dark in a colorful atmosphere. It\u2019s hard to explain as the darkness is just the addition of dark purples and blues but then the brightness of those colors pop. In artist terms, the supernatural part of the show is dark hues and the brighter everyday parts are more of lighter shades of pastels and such.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s talk about the voices. I love the how comical the narrator is and she helps bring a bit more life to the story. She doesn\u2019t pop up at any old time, only when it seems like it\u2019s supposed to be a comical part of even when some sort of hardship is happening like in the beginning. Sadly, every once in a while, she does come in at a wrong time when talking about what happen in the last show. Nanami talks way too much. She seems to want to be as good a narrator as the narrator is. When she first wakes up from her dream, she talks on and on about what she thought was a dream. This happens a lot it seems. Her voice is a bit annoying as she still seems rather stuck up, a very good contrast though to the rather gentle voice of Tomoe. Well, gentle might not be the right word for him as he is rather stuck up and rude to Nanami but he is voiced by one of my favorite voice actors J. Michael Tatum, the same voice as Sebastian from Black Butler. It\u2019s a very calming voice and it is fun to see him sort of freak out at some parts because of Nanami\u2019s mistakes or his own. I think that\u2019s what sets Tomoe apart from the others that Tatum has voiced before.\\n\\n\r\nI really thought it was a cute show although a bit to short. The ending was a ok ending but there is so much more that could of happened both before and after that I feel it falls a bit flat. I really did love watching it non the less.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nWhen you think about it, one's home is a very precious thing. It's a safe haven. It's private. It contains the parts of one's life he or she loves the most, including family or that newly imported figure. When someone says that the atmosphere feels \"homely,\" it's because at that moment, it is reminding him or her of that one place where he or she can truly be at peace. Sadly, some people don't have such a location. Others still are forced to change it. Within Kamisama Hajimemashita is a story depicting finding one's home with the helpand support of those held dear.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe adventure begins rather quickly. Nanami Momozono is a high school girl who is forced onto the streets after her father's gambling habits cause her to lose her home. One night, she saves a man who, as thanks, gives his \"home\" to her.\\n\\n\r\nKamisama Kiss (as it is also known) lays out its events in a rather episodic fashion. Much of what occurs involves Nanami overcoming difficulties based on her human status in a fully spiritual world. She has no powers, she's clumsy, and is helpful to a fault. However, her kindness almost always turns the outcome in her favor. Whether it is matchmaking the local swamp god or befriending her kidnapper, she finds it in her heart to love those around her. This trait is one that many characters from many shows obviously have. But it seems more appropriate here, given her literal god-like position.\\n\\n\r\nKamisama Kiss is a tale about the home. At the same time, it attempts to weave in the romantic relationship that develops between Nanami and Tomoe, her familiar. The romance involved is nothing powerful, but it is interesting. In a sense, it's about two people from different backgrounds (race, ethnicity, culture, etc.) coming to terms with the emotions they have. The season pits both of them on opposite sides of the spectrum. But as it unfolds, they begin inching closer and closer until at least a somewhat satisfying stopping point is reached. Its exploration isn't too deep, however. Besides Tomoe's strong animosity towards humans, the anime never truly questions or investigates such a pairing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd therein lays the problem. The romance and home ideas seem to be constantly butting heads in terms of story-telling. That is, the show doesn't know whether it wants to focus on the romance or the \"finding one's home\" side. Both are done nicely, but a dissonance is created where it doesn't know what it wants to be. It tries to use the romance to facilitate the home idea. When it does, it becomes more about the relationship and less about the overall message.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the ultimate message? The show tries to drive home (pun intended) the idea that one's home isn't necessarily where you were born or where you're able to be productive. Indeed, it's the place where one feels most comfortable. Being able to just relax and not have to worry about the outside world. Walking through that front door to be greeted by the things you love. That's home. Honestly speaking, the concept is simple, but one rarely gives it any thought. And that's because having a home in this sense is, for the majority, second nature.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nKamisama Kiss is, for the most part, rather plain.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style itself appears quite \"soft.\" The colors involved are generally boring, in that the show doesn't go out of its way to make anything incredibly eye-catching. This is true for the environments and the character designs. The locations are typical: the school, the shrine, the park, etc. The designs for the characters are tame, despite the spiritual nature that enshrouds them. The exception is Nanami. She has a beauty and radiance about her that is unnatural. The combination of her large eyes, taught smile, and lengthy brown hair probably give this effect. However, considering how there are thousands of clones like her in the anime world, her presence in the show was strange to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to actual animation, it varies between average and slightly below average. The show incorporates minimalist drawings and animation for good comedic effect. As the show progressed, however, the animation began to degrade. This is especially apparent near one of the ending sequences. Despite the buildup involved, what is given is never fully shown (i.e., not properly animated).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story may be askew, the characters of Kamisama Kiss are, for the most part, not.\\n\\n\r\nNanami is the star. Her kindness and determination know no bounds. A land god by day and a teenage girl by night, she does her best to bring happiness both to the shrine she calls home and to its inhabitants. Her determination often puts her in a bind, but she never lets it get the best of her. This is also true of her relationship with Tomoe. Her feelings are usually unrequited, but she just sees it as another obstacle to triumph. She starts the season unsure of where her life will take her next but by its conclusion, she can safely find solace both at home and in the heart. That is, for her, \"home is where the heart is\" is just as true as \"heart is where the home is.\"\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting character is Tomoe. His abrasive behavior and general lack of empathy make him difficult to approach, let alone get along with. However, as the anime demonstrates, there are underlying causes for this. The show characterizes Tomoe as this rude servant. However, like the humans he hates, he is multidimensional. The audience learns of his past, of his motivations, and of his more endearing qualities. There is actual reasoning for his standoffish attitude, and it was pleasant to learn of its underlying causes.\\n\\n\r\nThe side cast also does their job nicely. While each have their own personality, they serve a higher purpose. And that is in developing the relationship between Nanami and Tomoe. As easy examples, Mizuki (the snake familiar) provides Nanami with historical insight. Likewise, Kurama gives Tomoe important information pertaining to dealing with society. The side characters are able to do this because they specialize in these areas. And this is true for the rest of the characters. In their own way, they are able to add at least a smidgen of growth to the ever growing connection between the two main leads.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is, surprisingly, very good. The whispering vocals, the single guitar chords, and the more prevalent Chinese guitar give off a simple mellow feeling. The middle part with the perhaps clacking castanets is also a fun little transition.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the footsteps of the OP, the ED is sung in a very quiet manner. Again, the single guitar chords give the piece a more mellow effect. In fact, it almost makes everything eerie or mysterious. The beginning \"ah, ah, ah...\" is also a very smooth lead-in for the rest of song.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also well done. The atmospheric pieces really add nicely to the overall spiritual theme of the show. The piano keys, the hand drums, and especially the piece involving the \"water ripple\" sound (very hard to describe!) were executed nicely.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting wise, there are no standout performances to be had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nRomance is my forte. All of the blushing, the hand holding, the kissing, the hugging, the mutual feelings, I love it all. This one has most of these traits, and utilizes them well enough. Watching Nanami fall for the familiar she found was, therefore, quite an enjoyable experience. On top of this, she's mysteriously beautiful. Seeing her differing outfits or jubilant expression were usually enough to make me swoon.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy involved isn't anything grand. It does what it has to given the circumstances, usually with the minimalist animation talked about earlier. The hilarity involved also stems from the character interactions. Many of the cast rarely get along, so seeing them constantly arguing or teasing one another was usually possible to get a good laugh.\\n\\n\r\nKamisama Hajimemashita is the beginning of the couple that is Nanami and Tomoe. The stories involved, the romance, and the characters are fun to see, and I am anticipating what the continuation of god and servant will be.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, romance and home but gets lost in itself\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, soft, plain, and with at best average animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Nanami and Tomoe blossom, with literal supportive side cast\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, great OP, okay ED, good soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, Nanami is beautiful and so is romance\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

I always hoped it would be animated and freaked out the day I found out about it (two days before it aired) \r\n  The story is awesome I recently got into watching/reading anime/manga about youkai/ayakashi/akuma, whatever you want to call them, and when I first read the manga I fell in love with it.\r\nAs for the anime.....one word. AFRIKINAMAZING!!! (yes that counts as one word Xp)There are a lot of funny characters in the series and it's developed pretty well but what really sealed the deal for me was Tomoe....Tomoe Tomoe Tomoe!!!!! I absolutely L O V E his character...sure he seems like an ass in the first few episodes but boy does he grow on you....and keeps growing and growing annnd again GROWING.\\n\r\n  His character design is amazing and his voice -ahhhhhh- fits really well!!! I love his little attitude and just him in general!! He reminds me somewhat of Miketsukami Soushi from (Inu x Boku SS) and Inuyasha put together. He has kind of an attitude like Inuyasha but more of an appearance like Soushi in his 'youkai' form.   *sorry I'm being bias about Tomoe of course I like all the other characters too buut Tomoe and Nanami. That's really what the anime and manga are about*\\n\\n\\n\r\n   All together I have high expectations of this show hope to see a second third fourth and maybe fifth season of this show (hoping the manga last that long and it stays popular)  I recommend this and will recommend this 1,000,000 times to ANYONE who likes this sort of genre of shows.\\n\\n\r\nWatch the show...you'll reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally love it!",

            "content": "With the new season upon us, I thought I'd take the time to re-write a review I once deleted. \r\nThere may be very minor spoilers, so please, be aware.\r\nAh,  Kamisama Kiss. My one and eternal anime-enemy. I didn't think much when starting it, and just thought of it as another one of those shoujo girl-meets-supernatural guy and falls in love. Well, I wasn't necessarily wrong on that aspect. However, diving into it as the episodes moved along, I noticed disturbingly nostalgic details that I've seen before.\r\nStory (60/100)\u2014Nothing too exciting. A regular high school girl gets thrust into a world she is unfamiliar with, andhas to deal with taking the task of handling the moody male main character, having two other men ogling after her, and her feelings overall in the situation. You'd think a supernatural series about a girl unexpectedly becoming a deity would be extremely interesting. \\n\\n\r\nKamisama, is however, not that, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, Kamisama shares traits with one of the anime world's most beloved series\u2014InuYasha. It is not only the story that shares similarities, but the characters and settings as well. I'll try not to drag this review out too long, however, this was the main reason I couldn't enjoy KH. It was too similar. And by that, I don't mean the girl with powers falls in love with demon. I mean almost every detail was, in some way, from InuYasha. That turned me off instantly, and  I dropped it after episode 6, or so. However, keeping an open mind, I picked it up, and finished it once more.\\n\\n\r\nArt (90/100)\u2014The art is beautiful, I'll admit. The animation was fluid, pretty, and flowery\u2014typical of a shoujo. When scenes, such as in the first episode, that tried to have a more 'dark' atmosphere, failed a bit miserably. This series is just a bit too light-hearted to be taken seriously with darker moments. The character designs were a bit generic, however, they were very pretty to look at. One complain I have is that all the girls had an eternal blush\u2014which was very annoying. Other than that, my grievances with the art is very small.\\n\\n\r\nSound (80/100)\u2014The sound was crisp, however, I personally did not enjoy the flowery soundtrack. That is my opinion, but as all series, the soundtracks fit well with what they are assigned to. The seiyuus did an amazing job, despite some of them having very annoying voices. I personally enjoyed hearing Tachibana as Tomoe, as I was used to his high-pitched wailing that is Chiaki from Sekai-ichi Hatsukoi.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (50/100)\u2014 Flat, one-dimensional, and lackluster is what I have to say of these characters. Nanami is a typical shoujo protagonist. In fact, she mirrored that of InuYasha's Kagome\u2014which is to no surprise, as I despised Kagome as well. Not only in back-story, but personality as well. I won't go too into detail on these aspects, though, to avoid making this review even longer.\\n\r\nTomoe is like KH's InuYasha. In appearance, past, and personality. He is the typical shoujo male-protagonist that the girl falls for. \\n\\n\r\nOverall(60/100)\u2014Overall, I did not enjoy this series. It could have been executed so much better, had it not refused to have surgery to be removed as InuYasha's conjoined twin. The new season is doing a much better job of steering away from InuYasha, and thus far, am much more impressed with it.",

            "content": "Just a warning that I have only watched the first couple of episodes and that this review is only based on what I've seen. \r\nWhile watching the first episode of the anime, I was left with goosebumps. Not because of excitement, but of how embarassed I was with how it all turned out. It was sheer horror that such a brilliant manga was reduced to some fleeting anime that was probably made to attract viewers.\r\nWhen comparing it to its manga, I am not impressed with the anime. It seems as if it was made out of the whim with simplistic graphic designs. I mean c'mon,if you're making 13 episodes you could've at LEAST put in some effort to make it more appealing. I'm a tad bit angry that one of my favourite mangas have let me down so much in the anime that I have been eagerly anticipating. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening? It seemed more llike it should've been the ending. Like seiriously...ALL still pictures? are you THAT low on budget? Others might find it suitable for the anime due to the show's \"calm\" nature, but to me it's a sign of laziness. \\n\\n\r\nI'm also not too impressed with Nanami's voice actor, it just...doesn't suit her for some reason. It's better than having those high pitched squeaky voices but there's still just something...off. Her voice I could sort of deal with, but when it came to Onikiri and Kotetsu...mate you've lost me entirely. I'm glad I stopped watching it in order to forget how they sound like.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the manga is a high recommendation from me, just not the anime. In this case, all I can say is that some things are better left for the imagination.",

            "content": "Lion Tamers, Lion Tamers; gather round!\r\nWe take a look at \"Kamisama Hajimemashita\"\r\nAs some of you, who've been reading my reviews know; I have for a long time, been attempting to understand the teenage mind. After all, I was one once, ummm ... around the late 1960's. That was another time. Those were the days when a college graduate could find the United States on a colored World Globe. These days, 48% of college grads can't; actual statistic. In a very real sense, most people of that stripe today; can't find their own butt with both hands. Which explains why some can't properly analyze anime verywell.\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress. Let's get to some themes in \"Kamisama Hajimemashita\" that please and annoy; sometimes both at the same time. Other times, I have to kind of cringe, as sometimes I need to horsewhip the authors of some anime, but I'm never informed as to their actual whereabouts. Or they are not within arms' reach. This leaves me frustrated.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, we need to actually look at this anime with clear eyes, and the mind of a really mean ol' man, and try to figure out exactly what the heck is going on; that has any relation to real life. Silly me, nothing in this show is real life. It's all about that 'wishful thinking' stuff. Or sometimes dumb luck. Yea, that's better.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, we dive in. Firstly, before anyone wants to yell at me for bad-mouthing this anime, there are things I like about this show.\\n\\n\r\n1). The music is almost as cute as the show tries to be.\\n\r\n2). The artwork, while not standout, is good enough.\\n\r\n3). Tomoe is the only character that gets my interest; because he has actual real-life issues.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarities abound, between this anime and another (which is much better, and the jokes are much funnier). I compare 'Kamisama Hajimemashita' with 'xxxHolic'. xxxHolic is much better, in virtually every way; even the educational value is much higher.\\n\\n\r\n1). Does not each have a godlike figure which mentors our primary character?\\n\r\n2). Does not both godlike characters have issues with the primary character?\\n\r\n3). Are there not moments in both shows, where the primary character has severe issues with the godlike character?\\n\r\n4). Does not both primary characters go through dimensional rifts, and visit other world/times/places?\\n\\n\r\nThese are just a short list, but I think you get the idea. I rarely compare anime, but these two really need to be looked at as having plot-points and character references that show clear problems with Kamisama Hajimemashita.\\n\r\n----------------\\n\\n\r\nNow I get to talk about some of the characters.\\n\\n\r\n1). Nanami Momozona\\n\r\nI realize most of you like this girl. And she's a nice enough girl, even to me. But let's see. She is tossed from her home, and lands on a park bench; with no idea what she's gonna do. A land-God gives his job to her, for no explained reason, ever. Nanami has never held any job, has no idea how to carry out a normal job, let alone this new mission.\\n\\n\r\nThen, arriving at the temple, containing the people that help her carry out her mission; she goofs up how it operates, alienates her temple demon (for lot's of true-life reasons), botches relations with the few followers left; and then attempts to play catch-up on all this stuff. Only to botch it all again.\\n\\n\r\nIf not for the few servants and temple demon, she would have destroyed the temple, and these assistants, and hanger, would have been out of a job; and forced to return to the dimension from which they came. Most of them probably much happier.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real problem I have with Nanami, is that she is thrown into deep water without a paddle, or even the knowledge of what to do with the paddle once handed to her. And she never really learns. While she does learn the lessons given to her, she never develops a flair to repackage these new lessons, and re-use them to solve other problems. She always faces each problem with the same wide-eyed ignorance, and has to find each solution the hard way. She always needs Tomoe to help her. Sometimes the entire issue gets handed to his competent hands.\\n\\n\r\n2). Tomoe\\n\r\nWhat a great character he is! This is a guy that initially wanted nothing whatever to do with Nanami, and had given good riddens to Mikage (after Mikage got himself separated from the temple some 20 years before our story begins). When Nanami first arrives, Tomoe is quite happy managing things at the temple, and manages his underlings with efficiency and dispatch.\\n\\n\r\nNanami happens. Moves into the temple, screws up the well oil'd schedule that Tomoe has been tireless in designing. Forcing him eventually to teach her the rudiments of God-hood, tries to teach Nanami to keep schedules, that she finds impossible to keep (even schedules that deal in real-world things, which prove important). Frustrates every attempt to repair the temples' reputation with the public, which Nanami uses her lack of skills to pull the rug out of most of his attempts.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we wonder why Tomoe is so constantly dismayed by his new God-head of the temple. While he eventually becomes charmed by Nanami's simple charm, and quiet acceptance of troubles; the truth is, Tomoe never real becomes satisfied with her progress. Because there is so little of it. Nanami does improve, by small increments and spurts. While Tomoe finds she can dully learn a new idea, truly insightful \"ah ha\" moments are few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nEven he knows, no matter how much he ever learns to like his Temple-God, she is mentally incompetent, and will never really fulfill the promise he so dreams of.\\n\\n\r\n3). Mikage\\n\r\nYou cowardly worm.\\n\\n\r\n4). Mizuki\\n\r\nI realize the girls in the audience just love this guy. But let's please use some common sense. First he tries to destroy the land-God Temple, tries to replace the Land-God as a God of a Water-Temple. Failing that he then decides working for the Land-God, in his mind is just as good as replacing the God of his own Temple.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry, but this guy is a two-faced demon that cannot be relied on in the clutch. Things got tough, and he traitor'd and joined in at Nanami's digs. Any old port in the storm.\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nNow I want to talk about the more mundane production items in the story.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, I want to talk about Nanami Momozono's artwork. I like parts of this characters' personality, but the artwork has lots of problems. She is virtually the only character drawn with the 'big-eyed' look. And the artists went overboard.\\n\\n\r\nIn most artwork of this kind, big-eyed artwork is supplied with an enlarged head to allow for the spacial displacement of the brain. But in Nanami's case, these eye's are at least 2-inches in circumference. Now while viewers who actually like this touch might be dismayed by my attempts at 'pickiness', let's get a little bit real. In this case, they are so large, with no corresponding extra room provided, that I'm afraid that Nanami is not going have much of a frontal lobe. The eyes will intrude on it.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, it explains her lack of concentration, poor memory for times, dates, places; lack of learning skills. She has all of these talents, but they all function in a subpar way. In other words, Nanami is cute, pleasant; and stupid as a fence post.\\n\\n\r\nThe best drawn character has got to be Tomoe. He is slender, powerful (both physically and mentally), a bit mean, sly, and outright clever. He gets more than 100% more attention to his graphic details, than does Nanami. And it's a good thing too; or there would have been nothing in the show to complement for artwork.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the artwork is adequate, sometimes even attractive. But very little in the way of stuff that should stand out. Does this mean the story is bad because of the artwork? No. But the artwork, helped very little. Stick figures would have told the story with equal grace. Except for Tomoe. Even his expressions are done perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nSound and music needs improvement. While the music is cute and lively, even airy and pleasant; it does nothing to inform the viewer of the very strong Japanese religious references and cultural icons that should have been signal'd by it. This young lady becomes a God, a minor one, but a God nonetheless; with all the importance that should have been revolved around. The music failed to indicate anything of importance. Just some cute sentiments about love and friendship, which is true, but pales in importance to the over-arching theme inside the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story. While I realize this story is made to take a tongue-in-cheek look at friendship and romance, the vast majority of the story deals with the events that back-story for the supernatural characters in the show. In other words, the authors placed all the important material in the supernatural, and made the fun, light-friendship, and love-story; the minor theme.\\n\\n\r\nIs this hypocritical? No, but it strongly leads us to a cart-before-the-horse presentation of information, THAT FAILS TO TELL THE STORY. While I liked, very much, the supernatural back stories; they are in fact the secondary plot. The main story is the increasing, over much time; romance developed between Nanami and Tomoe.\\n\\n\r\nAll of that, the romantic elements; while cute and very romantic, are in fact , wrong headed in that they try to force something into place that would never happen in real life. Tomoe is a prisoner of the temple, and slave to his Land-God. He never could, in real life, ever find a way to resolve this. There is not a single theme in his own mind that would allow for friendship and affection. Even after the back-story proves a possible relationship in the offing; he could never settle into a romantic entanglement that imprisons him; not once but twice, by the intentional actions of Nanami.\\n\\n\r\nHe has a right to be viciously angry. Forced to help his God, forced to be the house-servant, forced to be polite at all times, forced to keep the temple from ruin, force to protect the very person that has made him the slave he is.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Nanami never confronts this moral dilemma.\\n\\n\r\nBoth of them trapped in this non-sequitur, for all time. And young people think this is a proper and cute love-story for the ages?\\n\\n\r\nI give \"Kamisama Hajimemashita\" a 7.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm normally not a fan of your typical  comedy/romance/shoujo anime, but I must admit I really loved this one. \r\nNow, the plot may not be that original, but who cares? It's an enjoyable anime, that's more than enough to satisfy the regular viewer.\r\nStory 9/10:A quick synopsis of the anime would be a girl becomes a deity, and get's a familiar. As she starts to train to become a better deity her relationship grows with her familiar. The story is basically set up for a romance theme, and it's quite interesting. There are some cool fight scenes and very good plot lines. It's definitely nota \"unique\" story line, but what matters is it fits into the anime very well. The anime is hilarious at times, and also has touching/adorable moments. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: Aside from the main characters blushing consisting of cross-marks across her face (I can't stand that), everything else about the art is consistent and well done. The characters are appealing, and so is the scenery.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: When you first press that play button, your ears will be gifted with an amazing OP, and then towards the end an amazing ED. They're both soothing to the ear and have great lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: There's a lot of character development as the story progresses. I first assumed no development was occurring because all the characters were in a bit of a slump, but I was relieved when I started to see more growth. Of course, each character has their own back story and they're all pretty interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: I really liked watching this anime, and it's probably the only romance I'll ever watch. I found myself laughing out loud a lot, and I really like the main characters and their personalities. It's not just lovey-dovey things, the characters often stay true to their personalities and that's what is best.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: *I'd recommend this to anyone whose looking for a quick romance anime, with a bit of action.*",

            "content": "So, I've wanted to stop watching this from the first episode, but I do believe in giving a show 3 episodes to sell itself, so I did watch three.\r\nIt did not sell.\r\nThe story is is about high-school girl Nanami who, after being thrown on the streets due to her (now fled) father's gambling debts, gets tricked by a minor god into taking over his position, and is swift to bind the former familiar spirit to her service.\r\nSeeing the high scores of other people for this anime really surprised me. To you that have rated this anything from 8 upwards, have you really nothing better towatch? Did you really consider the plot points of this story and think 'Huh, this is refreshing and well thought-out', or find Nanami's character compelling in any way?\\n\\n\r\nThen again, everyone has equal rights to an opinion. Who knows, maybe the rest of series after episode three really kicks it up a notch (or several) and actually escapes garbage territory. I guess I'll never find out.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's take things one at a time.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\r\nRight off the bat, the story ticks me off. There is not a single ounce of realism to it, to the point where it becomes ridiculous and hard to take with any degree of seriousness.\\n\r\nFirst of all, the idea that an underage high-school girl would be thrown on the street with no consideration from either the state, relatives or acquaintances. Now, one might argue by presenting japanese law that enables this to happen and go on to say that maybe literally no one knew Nanami and her father. Fine. Whatever. I accept this as the premise.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Nanami's blase attitude about being literally homeless. \\n\\n\r\nThen she just casually goes along with some creepy dude who kissed her and told her to go a place she doesn't know right after learning she has nowhere else to go. Because making you a god is exactly what creepy dudes who invite you to their place want to do to you.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the whole, uncomfortable fact of Tomoe's slavery. Because that's what it is. Call it service if you want but that is not accurate, as Tomoe himself did not agree to it, was not willing, and in fact had to be caught by surprise and forced into servitude. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that this is never addressed doesn't matter. It doesn't make it any less of an issue. Despite what anime tells you, being enslaved by a cute high school girl is not okay.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on like this with things from all 3 episodes I watched. The plot for the episode is dreadful, not even trying to make sense or pass its messages with any degree of subtlety or finesse.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, not one single aspect of the Story drew anything from me beyond  irritation.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\r\nThe animation on this is lazy. Skirting the edges of outright bad. It's a serious enough issue that I was thinking about it while watching and breaking immersion (though the plot managed to do that by itself). Not much else to say.  Seen a lot worse, certainly, but most of what I've seen has been better in terms of Art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nGood opening/closing theme, I'll give it that. But beyond that, the music in the actual episode was practically nonexistent, and most of voice-acting was grating, especially the two spirits, the old narrator (whose absence would have done the show a favor) and even Nanami herself to a smaller degree.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nHere comes the crux of my issue with this story.  Perhaps the only character I even remotely like in this anime is Mikage, the creepy dude who scammed a high-school girl into taking over his responsibilities and potentially getting eaten by demons.\\n\\n\r\nNanami's problem is that she's not really a character. There is nothing unique about her. She's a caricature. Caricatures are what you find in terrible anime that think recycling tropes is enough to make a story; it's not.\\n\\n\r\nShe's the age-old stereotype of a dumb, hapless young girl/boy who, despite not really being good at anything, has a heart of gold manages to win people over with her/his earnestness. \\n\r\nWow. I've never seen that one before. And before anyone rushes to protest, my issue isn't that she fits this description, it's only that she literally nothing else to say for herself by episode three.\\n\\n\r\nHell, if something does set her apart, it's that she seems to be dumber than most examples of the stereotype. The first three episodes are nothing beyond a repetition of the same thing: Nanami tries to do something stupid regarding things she literally knows nothing about that will have repercussions and might even get her killed. Tomoe warns her against it, often explaining exactly why the idea is stupid. Nanami does it anyway. Tomoe bails her out. No one mentions how retarded doing the thing was after it happens. Tomoe tends to (for some reason?) get an earful.\\n\\n\r\nThis got annoying to watch very quickly. \\n\\n\r\n  High-school kids are dumb, granted, so that's not unrealistic, but it doesn't make for a very good show if it has nothing to counterbalance it. Stupidity as a character trait is not bad by itself, and is often used in comedic attempts or as a tool for exposition. But when it becomes a plot-driving point, that's when you have an issue.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but Nanami is stubborn and prideful to the point of suicide. This is shown front-and center on episode one. However much you like this anime, however skewed your perception is towards the positive, this is not up for debate. It's literally what happened.\\n\\n\r\nGood for Nanami that she managed to keep her pride but also managed to enslave Tomoe in time for him to save her. I find this particularly ironic, because if the genders were reversed in this situation, I don't think the show would have been received half as well. Double standards, much?\\n\\n\r\nNow, Tomoe I like. I have a penchant towards competent characters, and that's all Tomoe is. Is allowed to be, rather. Competent. At things. In general. By episode three, he hasn't really shown much beyond competence and a plot-forced capacity to forgive both crimes against him as well as sheer, unadulterated stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nThe two spirits are nothing beyond exposition dump, with the occasional attempt at humorous skits, which, in my eyes at least, fail quite spectacularly. Their actual role in the story is never explained, so there's not much else for me to think of them as.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nAll my issues over the plot and the characters and the fact that the show is just a heap of cheap tropes made it really hard to enjoy this. There's nothing that made me feel like watching even this far wasn't a waste of time. If I give it a 2, it's because it's not as offensive a waste as some other things I have watched.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall score is 3/10\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: \"Can't you ignore the things that don't make sense and just enjoy the anime, man?\"\\n\\n\r\nNo.",

            "content": "This anime started strong. with a story that interested me, but after some episodic encounters lost itself.\r\nStory:  This is an interesting set-up, with an average girl being thrust into the position of a god.  Now, a Shinto god isn't necessarily as big a deal as that might sound like; Nanami is just responsible for the small area of the Mikage Shrine, but it's still a pretty big responsibility for somebody who doesn't feel she amounts to much.  And there was much potential here for Nanami to work hard so she grows into her role and finds a new home, but I feltthe anime failed to show that.  Instead of Nanami learning things, Tomoe mostly keeps her out of it, and handles everything himself, and since she isn't happy being kept in the dark, she impulsively does what she wants at the worst possible moments.  Of course she is a plucky little heroine, so she pulls off some unbelievable feats at times, but it all seems quite random to me.  The theme of the show seems to revolve around \"home\" and what that means, but it soon starts bumping into the inevitable shoujo romance, because Tomoe is a hot tsundere with a tragic past.  I am not at all convinced by the romance, those two have to my mind zero chemistry and nothing much in common.  Instead of Nanami getting to know the lay of the land, as it seemed in the initial episodes, we start wasting time at her school, where she sometimes goes and sometimes doesn't, with Tomoe in school drag or not, with another of her small harem and Tomoe glaring at each other...  it was kind of dragging on at that point.  I also don't get what all the interference by camp-gay boy and Mikage is about; they are simultaneously challenging/helping Nanami to grow I guess, but it too is random.  Nothing in the story seems very well thought through.\\n\\n\r\nArt (4/10):  Nothing much to write home about.  I especially didn't care for Nanami's design.  All the boys are of course meant to be hot, and do at least have clearly distinguished designs.  The animation is fairly minimal. \\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10):  The more traditional Japanese BGM fit the story well. I didn't care for the OP, but the ED was interesting.  Some of the voice talent didn't seem to fit its roles very well, and in general nobody stood out for me.  I found the narrator annoying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4/10): Nanami started out with potential, but I found her development much too uneven.  Tomoe really had the best development, though not everything made sense either -- for somebody who once couldn't bear to be touched by a human, he is awfully free with touching random women, and that is of course played for jealousy on Nanami's side; but it feels like such an artificial thing.  Other character development is too abrupt to feel natural, and so Mizuki and Karuma just become harem characters instead of decent characters on their own merit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10):  I enjoyed the first few episodes, but then that fell off.  I don't care about the romance at all because Nanami is such an undeveloped personality that I don't see what Tomoe would ever see in her (other than that she is obviously related to his first true love, so maybe he sees some echo there).  Yukiji was clearly meant to be a Yamato Nadeshiko, because what else could get a youkai to reject his old ways, but I don't see Nanami in the same light.",

            "content": "[STORY]\r\n-----------\r\nOverall, this season of Kamisama Hajimemashita was very interesting. I for one really enjoy romance and shoujo, and this anime really hit the jackpot. Even though it was really center around only one male protagonist, it was still very enjoyable for me. \r\n[ART]\r\n-----------\r\nThe graphics were fantastic, and it was really high quality, adding that the scenery was well detailed as well. \r\n[SOUND]\r\n-----------\r\nI have watched both dubbed and subbed for this anime, and the voice actors / actresses really did a fantastic job of showing emotions in their character, especially Tomoe, Momozono, and Kurama. Even so, I don't remember hearing much background music when it wasreally needed. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThe characters were extremely cute, especially Tomoe and Momozono. They both had cute chibi moments and romantic moments. Even when they are serious, the producers really did a good job of showing their emotions that they want to show. Kurama was an interesting character. He had this very 'dark' appearance, making me think that he'll stay an antagonist throughout the whole series, but I was wrong. I guess you really can't judge a character by their looks. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThe story had a really good plot, and they really did a good job when it came to the main characters by passing their obstacles and adventures. The love Momozono had for Tomoe really made me want to keep watching the whole series, including season 2 and the Kako-hen as well. Their romantic scenes really made me hope that they would eventually fall in love with each other and have a happy ending of this series, but you'll have to watch yourself what really happens.\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI wrote this review after I watched the whole series, including the Kako-hen and the Kamisama, Shiawase ni Naru part, so I don't really remember which events were in this anime of the series, although, I do prefer the 2nd season over the 1st, because it had a lot more interesting plots on the story, although season 1 was still fantastic and enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE:\\n\r\n9/10",

Throw in a few extra men just to make the love interest realize his feelings, and the formula of a good romantic comedy is complete. \r\nThe story isn't complicated whatsoever. In fact, it's incredibly basic and easy to understand. Even with the few snippets of backstory that was shown, you can piece together a few things. The animation was nice and somehow suited the love interests characteras well as the main. As for character development-wise I felt like they tried way, way too hard to make Nanami a mixture between a Mary Sue (basically a character with no flaws) and your typical average shoujo klutz. Though, it is cute to see Tomoe rescue her all the time so I can't have too many complaints. I just wish she could have been a bit stronger as a character -- then again, it only has 13 episodes. Sigh, only when it's over do you realize that where you started out with no expectations, you slowly begin to expect a little something, whatever that may be.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was slightly disappointing for reasons that I won't bother going into due to spoiling the ending. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I didn't feel that watching this anime was a waste of time.

            "content": "This is a review of both season 1 and 2 of Kamisama Hajimemashita, since they were pretty much the same in terms of quality. \r\nOverall Enjoyment- 8/10 Very Good - The best aspect of Kamisama Hajimemashita is definitely the two main characters and how they overcome obstacles and grow closer to each other. The other elements (plot, music, and animation) were enjoyable as well. I have rewatched this series 3 times, and is my favorite anime of all time as a shoujo lover, and is by far among the top 2 best romantic shoujos I have watched, Akatsuki No Yona being the other. The overallseries goes up to a 9/10 if you include the OVAs. \\n\\n\r\nPlot overall- 8/10  Very Good - Nanami suddenly becomes a deity who learns her responsibilities to her worshipers and shrine, fend off attacks from dark beings, overcome the stigma of being a mortal deity, meanwhile managing school, and having fun with friends along the way. She gets help from others in her endeavors, but most of the help comes from her fox familiar (guardian), Tomoe, who has a mysterious and intriguing past that is explored. The main themes are overcoming obstacles with determination, fighting for the people you care about, being kind and helping others, truly and selflessly loving someone, and finding the place and people you belong with. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few adventurous plot arcs of varying lengths, but the plot remains interesting or at least fun even in episodes where there is a reprieve from big obstacles. Still, I can't help but think the plot could have been developed a little better. \\n\\n\r\nRomance- 8/10 Very Good - I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but the romance was lovely! I couldn\u2019t get over how beautiful and sweet it was! This is technically considered a reverse harem because there are several characters who have a crush on or fall in love with Nanami at different points, but they\u2019re all not around her in every episode and it isn\u2019t a big part of the plot since Nanami has her sights on only one guy. Later, in the OVAs my romance rating goes up to a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nMain characters- 8/10 Very Good - Nanami is sweet, caring, and very conscious of her duties. She does not like being a burden on others, so she gets tough, brave, and clever when she faces obstacles. She can hold her own well and doesn\u2019t always need someone to swoop in. The ratio of her saving/helping others and her being helped/saved by others is pretty equal, which is a beautiful balance, and a great lesson to learn. Tomoe is quiet and acts like he doesn\u2019t care about much, but goes above and beyond his duties as a familiar and also cares deeply for Nanami. Overall, Tomoe\u2019s character has a lot of depth and Nanami\u2019s qualities are endearing.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting characters- 6/10 Fair -The supporting characters were often used as comic relief and occasional aids to Nanami. Sadly, I feel ambivalent towards most of the supporting characters because quite a few of them felt\u2026 underdeveloped in my opinion even though some of them got backstories.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 7/10 Good -The animation wasn\u2019t breathtaking and was just average, so I was content. There were some character designs that were much more visually pleasing than others, but no one looked appalling. They do pay attention to little details on characters at times, such as the disinterested curves of Tomoe\u2019s lips, which I appreciated. The chibi forms of characters during joke scenes are the best! My only gripe was that Nanami\u2019s character design made her look a lot younger than she is.\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Voice Acting- 8/10 Very Good - Loved the opening/closing songs of both seasons! The songs were are upbeat, catchy, and cute which perfectly matched Nanami\u2019s personality. The background music was okay overall. There\u2019s a rock star character and the songs he sang were ok, but weren\u2019t something I would care to listen to again. There was a lovely instrumental background song that paired wonderfully with romantic scenes. I thought all the voice actors cast for the characters were either appropriate or perfect overall, from Tomoe to even the minute characters who had only a few lines. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Please make sure you watch the OVAs especially the Kako Hen episodes! They are extremely important to the overall plot, explain any lingering questions or things you missed in the seasons, and wrap everything up so nicely. \\n",

The manga's storyline is better of course, but the anime has an enjoyable storyline as well. You will not be lacking a lovely dose of gods or traditional clothing mixed in with some mythology. \r\nArt: 9/10\r\nI guess the art could have been better, but overall the art was very cute and pleasing to watch. It was done in a shoujo-like style, with the females possessing large eyes and the males having smaller,sharper eyes. \\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe background audio and the voice acting were both spectacular. I ecspecially enjoyed the voice acting though. I believe the voice actors match the characters personas in a wonderful way. Although please register that I'm talking about the Japanese voice actors, because in all honesty most American voice actors sound like rubbish in anime. \\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI love the characters. You start off with Nanami, who has just lost everything being thrown into a new world, and then there's Tomoe who is kinda tsundere-ish in characteristics. They have comedic arguments once in a while as well. The characters all have lovely personalities that grow on you at one point or another. Also I enjoyed Nanami's emotional development in the anime. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is where I become extremely biased. I totally end entirely loved this anime because it had traditional clothing incorporated with mythology and gods. I really loved watching this anime. \\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 \\n\r\nIt had everything I looked for in an anime. Which is traditional clothing, mythology, and a cute romantic interest.",

First of all, I'd been plenty away from the usual shoujo, slice of life, romance that it hit me hard how much I'd missed it watching Kamisama Hajimemashita. It's simply a perfect anime to watch during free time because you can't really take it seriously and just fangirl at the otp, which I have the urge to state, but must resist. I hadn't shipped so hard in months, but in this anime, I was screaming inside (cause I'd watch at night) hoping the otp would just admit their undying love for each other. I'd be screaminglike a dying whale if I watched during the day, really. You will understand the abundance and extremity of fanservice of this anime. No more comment. Other than that, the characters are adorable, every single one. Characer development was much better than story progression imo, but character development made up for it by making you forget what the heck is even going on the story. Music is very memorable to me too. The theme songs have a bit of a sexy tone and its really cute and I love that little track that comes on for every touchy moment, which goes for every shoujo anime, but I had to say it :)You will fall in love with the main guy character. He's freakin' beautiful.... liek, how can you not ? ;^; ENJOY THE SHOW ~",

I thought it would be very cliche` and boring but I was pleasantly surprised and completely wrong. \r\nIf you are looking for a romance/comedy then this is one is probably a must watch. There were moments where I anticipated what was going to happen but instead I was left in tears of laughter from the comedy side of this anime. \r\nI don't really think there is any real flaw in Kami-sama Hajimemashita. The only thing that I dislikeabout it is the fact that there are only 13 episodes, however, for an anime that is short and has an ongoing manga it is tied up pretty well and doesn't leave you with that sense of disappointment you get with most animes that are short and sweet. \\n\\n\r\nI know a lot of anime fans out there dislike the heroines in animes that don't play much of a role in the story line but for this particular female protagonist you will find she actually does a lot and isn't a hopeless damsel in distress :)",

The difference between Kamisama Hajimemashita and other animes in terms of character was that the lead, nanami, was LIKEABLE. All of the characters were done very well but Nanami really caught my attention. yes she had some of  THOSE traits (bossy, clumsy etc.) but she was also funny, hardworking and persistent.Tomoe another main is theaudience getter, he's very cliche. He's possessive, arrogant (bordering mean) and saves Nanami in basically every episode. It's the regular anime guy persona but i'm a regular teenage girl and honestly, that's what i like to see. Despite the shortness of the anime the characters do develop and change. \\n\\n\r\nstory. this is really the most important part isn't it?  A young human girl becomes the a land god of a shrine and has to basically deal with her daily life as a god and a student. Oh and spoiler alert she falls in love with her familiar (Tomoe) who she's now living with. So it's simple. But it's alos sweet, funny and has places to go which can make a simple story refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art.  i'm not particularly versed in the dos and don'ts of anime artwork, but i do know what looks visually appealing. kamisama hajimemashita is better than many but far from perfect. in my opinion, Kamisama Hajimemashita looked good.\\n\\n\r\nfinal topic; sound. there really was none.. which is why i think this is Kamisama Hajimemashita greatest downfall. you had an ending, you had an opening which were very catchy i'll admit, but that was it. \\n\\n\r\nI liked this anime because i'm cliche. The creators knew what i liked and they delivered. A story with magic, an attractive male lead, a female lead who didn't annoy me and a heavy load of romance. That is why i think Kamisama Hajimemashita is outstanding, it was enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nYou should watch Kamisama Hajimemashita. It's short. i watched all 13 episodes in a day so spend a day (or maybe a few if you have a life) and enjoy this little gem of an anime. \\n\\n\r\ni hope for another season of Kamisama Hajimemashita!",

            "content": "Ah kamisama, why doesn't money grow on trees especially when I'm in debt?\r\nAh kamisama, where are you when I need you the most?\r\nAh kamisama, why can't the world be perfect?\r\nIn a nutshell, Kamisama Hajimemashita (also known as Kamisama Kiss) is based on the manga of the same name written by Julietta Suzuki. She is known for several other lighthearted shoujo manga that involves supernatural elements such as Karakuri Odette. The series debuted in Fall of 2012 along with many other shuojo titles. \r\nThe series tells the story of a young girl named Nanami Momozono, who is alone..abandoned, and helpless. The innocent little lamp makes aninteresting encounter with a strange man (Mikagi) and from there, her life changes forever. But wait, it doesn't stop there. She also encounters the big bad wolf (or rather familiar) Tomoe. Along with him comes the package of two other spirits (Onikiri and Kotetsu). After a contract sealed by a kiss, the two forms as peculiar relationship. This series details their relationship and what's to come from it because the world is never fair. It's not perfect.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, this series is quite a strange one if you look on the surface. We have a normal human with no experience of the supernatural in a strange relationship with strange being with strange ears and a strange personality. Did I mention strange? \\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Nanami and Tomoe is one of the most strange, amusing, and interesting part of the series. A human and a familiar relationship has trouble written all over it especially the gap of difference between the two. Nanami is a normal human girl who has normal skills in life with normal friends attending a normal school. On the other hand, Tomoe is a supernatural being with supernatural abilities and able to accomplish feats with supernatural degrees. \\n\\n\r\nThis is like trying to get a cobra and mongoose to be best friends...\\n\\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Tomoe is very frustrated at Nanami's lack of progress in what she's trying to become and adjusting with her new life. He becomes increasingly annoyed at home, at school, and almost whenever he's around with Nanami, or precisely whenever he feels nothing is getting done. This example can be seen early in the series as result of Nanami's lack of progress with her new responsibilities. Yet at various times, there are sweet and tender moments where Tomoe feels empathy, care, and even jealousy for her. Wait a minute..is that a male tsundere I see in Tomoe?? \\n\\n\r\nBeing a shoujo series adapted from a shoujo manga, expect shoujo themes and elements. That typically transits in to the romance part of Kamisama Kiss. Even from the second word of the title and the pilot episode, one can expect romance in it. It's not one of those love at first sights though or a helpless crush but rather a strange one to say the least. To add to the mix, there are other characters such as the highly popular idol at school Shinjirou Kuram. He's the narcasstic type who causes trouble and tension between the duo but at the same time can be a fun guy to get to know with. There are other characters who occasionally adds in their own spotlights to the series as well such as the snake familiar Mizuki, Nanami's friend Mei, and later on a more dramatic entry of Ryuuou.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is overall quite lighthearted. There is virtually no fan-service except \u201cmaybe\u201d the beach episode in the latter half. It's more of a series where its comedy outshines its romance aspects especially the strange relationship between Nanami and Tomoe. Other characters adds in the comedy even during scenes where action is presented. So, if you're looking for some serious mindfuck, ecchi fan-service, or a dynamic story exploring serious themes, then you might be disappointed. Still though, the romance part does begin to blossom later on in the series especially after a pleasant date (maybe not entirely for Tomoe) and some tender moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the series is lighthearted as well. The art seems to be a bit pale and plain at most times that reflects the nature of this shoujo series. Most of Julietta Suzuki's artwork balances between romance and comedy and that is presented in Kamisama Kiss as well. The series focuses more on the characters rather than anything else with its artwork thus it's just ordinary; nothing too special to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and music applies here as well of being lighthearted. There is no intense or techno music rhythm even during some of the more dramatic and action scenes. Kurama's entry is often accompanied by his own soundtrack theme that brings out the inner fan girls at school so in some ways, it can be considered a little rock on added to the mix. The OP and ED songs are also lighthearted with one half of the title \u201cKamisama\u201d being echoed for the latter. Once again, it seems to just be in the background with a pleasant melody rather than anything special.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found Kamisama Kiss to be a charming little gem but nothing too special. It doesn't shine much as the series is shoujo with lighthearted themes. It's not mainstream compared to a few of the other shoujo series in the industry today (especially this Fall Season of 2012). But what it does have is a relaxing way of presenting romance mixed with comedy especially with the strange duo of Nanami and Tomoe. It's one of those series where you can sit down, watch it, and then tell yourself \u201cwell, that was cute\u201d. And of course, cute is another word to describe Kamisama Kiss especially with the supernatural elements mixed in. Some of the episodes does seem a bit dry with a lack of flavor but it can still be a fun watch especially if you enjoy its shoujo themes.\\n",

            "content": "A young girl is abandoned by her father who owes money and is left to fend for herself. This sounds like it\u2019s an excuse for the parents to not care what happens to their child while strange things are around them. It\u2019s clich\u00e9 but I can\u2019t think of any other way they could have walked around this. The fact of the matter is that they had to get rid of the parents one way or another and they picked one of the two ways they could have done it. That or make them dead and have her an orphan but that one is used evenmore often then the person leaving their child. I only wonder where the mother is. Nanami is well\u2026 not my favorite heroine although she is actually rather strong willed. I don\u2019t like how she is always saying pretty much anything that\u2019s on her mind rather quick, sometimes she ends up going on these rants like one that I talk about later on. On the other hand, I love how sweet a spirit she is in that she wants to help anyone she comes in contact with. She has had a hard life so it would have been so easy to make her selfless like Honda from Fruits Basket but she isn\u2019t. She acts selfish many times though she never does it to get on someone\u2019s nerves (Unless it\u2019s Tomoe).\\n\\n\r\nWell, like normal romance, she is taken in by someone and falls in love with the person even if he is not of this world. It would be fine if this was a normal romance with the man being a human but in this case, we have a fox spirit who has a really bad temper at times. At first glance, I guess you could consider Tomoe a muli-personalitied demon. He will fix Nanami dinner after telling her he despises being her familiar; call her a idiot when he is trying to save her; and things similar of that nature. With all the whining he seems to do about her, you would think he would just up and quit when he got a chance, right? Well, that\u2019s what I thought when he was free of his duties at one part but then he reinstates his position as her familiar again. That is not a real spoiler as it happens really early in the show but it\u2019s a good example of just how split this guy is.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is a bit, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just a bit confusing. It\u2019s all images of her with a song about being a girl and just starting to be a girl? I\u2019m confused as to what the opening was supposed to do as they don\u2019t really do anything but show this young girl. It didn\u2019t fit the show at all making me want to skip it every time. Other then that, the animation and everything reminds me of a lot of other shows out there with a supernatural spoof. It\u2019s dark in a colorful atmosphere. It\u2019s hard to explain as the darkness is just the addition of dark purples and blues but then the brightness of those colors pop. In artist terms, the supernatural part of the show is dark hues and the brighter everyday parts are more of lighter shades of pastels and such.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s talk about the voices. I love the how comical the narrator is and she helps bring a bit more life to the story. She doesn\u2019t pop up at any old time, only when it seems like it\u2019s supposed to be a comical part of even when some sort of hardship is happening like in the beginning. Sadly, every once in a while, she does come in at a wrong time when talking about what happen in the last show. Nanami talks way too much. She seems to want to be as good a narrator as the narrator is. When she first wakes up from her dream, she talks on and on about what she thought was a dream. This happens a lot it seems. Her voice is a bit annoying as she still seems rather stuck up, a very good contrast though to the rather gentle voice of Tomoe. Well, gentle might not be the right word for him as he is rather stuck up and rude to Nanami but he is voiced by one of my favorite voice actors J. Michael Tatum, the same voice as Sebastian from Black Butler. It\u2019s a very calming voice and it is fun to see him sort of freak out at some parts because of Nanami\u2019s mistakes or his own. I think that\u2019s what sets Tomoe apart from the others that Tatum has voiced before.\\n\\n\r\nI really thought it was a cute show although a bit to short. The ending was a ok ending but there is so much more that could of happened both before and after that I feel it falls a bit flat. I really did love watching it non the less.",

Sadly, some people don't have such a location. Others still are forced to change it. Within Kamisama Hajimemashita is a story depicting finding one's home with the helpand support of those held dear.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe adventure begins rather quickly. Nanami Momozono is a high school girl who is forced onto the streets after her father's gambling habits cause her to lose her home. One night, she saves a man who, as thanks, gives his \"home\" to her.\\n\\n\r\nKamisama Kiss (as it is also known) lays out its events in a rather episodic fashion. Much of what occurs involves Nanami overcoming difficulties based on her human status in a fully spiritual world. She has no powers, she's clumsy, and is helpful to a fault. However, her kindness almost always turns the outcome in her favor. Whether it is matchmaking the local swamp god or befriending her kidnapper, she finds it in her heart to love those around her. This trait is one that many characters from many shows obviously have. But it seems more appropriate here, given her literal god-like position.\\n\\n\r\nKamisama Kiss is a tale about the home. At the same time, it attempts to weave in the romantic relationship that develops between Nanami and Tomoe, her familiar. The romance involved is nothing powerful, but it is interesting. In a sense, it's about two people from different backgrounds (race, ethnicity, culture, etc.) coming to terms with the emotions they have. The season pits both of them on opposite sides of the spectrum. But as it unfolds, they begin inching closer and closer until at least a somewhat satisfying stopping point is reached. Its exploration isn't too deep, however. Besides Tomoe's strong animosity towards humans, the anime never truly questions or investigates such a pairing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd therein lays the problem. The romance and home ideas seem to be constantly butting heads in terms of story-telling. That is, the show doesn't know whether it wants to focus on the romance or the \"finding one's home\" side. Both are done nicely, but a dissonance is created where it doesn't know what it wants to be. It tries to use the romance to facilitate the home idea. When it does, it becomes more about the relationship and less about the overall message.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the ultimate message? The show tries to drive home (pun intended) the idea that one's home isn't necessarily where you were born or where you're able to be productive. Indeed, it's the place where one feels most comfortable. Being able to just relax and not have to worry about the outside world. Walking through that front door to be greeted by the things you love. That's home. Honestly speaking, the concept is simple, but one rarely gives it any thought. And that's because having a home in this sense is, for the majority, second nature.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nKamisama Kiss is, for the most part, rather plain.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style itself appears quite \"soft.\" The colors involved are generally boring, in that the show doesn't go out of its way to make anything incredibly eye-catching. This is true for the environments and the character designs. The locations are typical: the school, the shrine, the park, etc. The designs for the characters are tame, despite the spiritual nature that enshrouds them. The exception is Nanami. She has a beauty and radiance about her that is unnatural. The combination of her large eyes, taught smile, and lengthy brown hair probably give this effect. However, considering how there are thousands of clones like her in the anime world, her presence in the show was strange to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to actual animation, it varies between average and slightly below average. The show incorporates minimalist drawings and animation for good comedic effect. As the show progressed, however, the animation began to degrade. This is especially apparent near one of the ending sequences. Despite the buildup involved, what is given is never fully shown (i.e., not properly animated).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story may be askew, the characters of Kamisama Kiss are, for the most part, not.\\n\\n\r\nNanami is the star. Her kindness and determination know no bounds. A land god by day and a teenage girl by night, she does her best to bring happiness both to the shrine she calls home and to its inhabitants. Her determination often puts her in a bind, but she never lets it get the best of her. This is also true of her relationship with Tomoe. Her feelings are usually unrequited, but she just sees it as another obstacle to triumph. She starts the season unsure of where her life will take her next but by its conclusion, she can safely find solace both at home and in the heart. That is, for her, \"home is where the heart is\" is just as true as \"heart is where the home is.\"\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting character is Tomoe. His abrasive behavior and general lack of empathy make him difficult to approach, let alone get along with. However, as the anime demonstrates, there are underlying causes for this. The show characterizes Tomoe as this rude servant. However, like the humans he hates, he is multidimensional. The audience learns of his past, of his motivations, and of his more endearing qualities. There is actual reasoning for his standoffish attitude, and it was pleasant to learn of its underlying causes.\\n\\n\r\nThe side cast also does their job nicely. While each have their own personality, they serve a higher purpose. And that is in developing the relationship between Nanami and Tomoe. As easy examples, Mizuki (the snake familiar) provides Nanami with historical insight. Likewise, Kurama gives Tomoe important information pertaining to dealing with society. The side characters are able to do this because they specialize in these areas. And this is true for the rest of the characters. In their own way, they are able to add at least a smidgen of growth to the ever growing connection between the two main leads.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is, surprisingly, very good. The whispering vocals, the single guitar chords, and the more prevalent Chinese guitar give off a simple mellow feeling. The middle part with the perhaps clacking castanets is also a fun little transition.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the footsteps of the OP, the ED is sung in a very quiet manner. Again, the single guitar chords give the piece a more mellow effect. In fact, it almost makes everything eerie or mysterious. The beginning \"ah, ah, ah...\" is also a very smooth lead-in for the rest of song.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also well done. The atmospheric pieces really add nicely to the overall spiritual theme of the show. The piano keys, the hand drums, and especially the piece involving the \"water ripple\" sound (very hard to describe!) were executed nicely.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting wise, there are no standout performances to be had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nRomance is my forte. All of the blushing, the hand holding, the kissing, the hugging, the mutual feelings, I love it all. This one has most of these traits, and utilizes them well enough. Watching Nanami fall for the familiar she found was, therefore, quite an enjoyable experience. On top of this, she's mysteriously beautiful. Seeing her differing outfits or jubilant expression were usually enough to make me swoon.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy involved isn't anything grand. It does what it has to given the circumstances, usually with the minimalist animation talked about earlier. The hilarity involved also stems from the character interactions. Many of the cast rarely get along, so seeing them constantly arguing or teasing one another was usually possible to get a good laugh.\\n\\n\r\nKamisama Hajimemashita is the beginning of the couple that is Nanami and Tomoe. The stories involved, the romance, and the characters are fun to see, and I am anticipating what the continuation of god and servant will be.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, romance and home but gets lost in itself\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, soft, plain, and with at best average animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Nanami and Tomoe blossom, with literal supportive side cast\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, great OP, okay ED, good soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, Nanami is beautiful and so is romance\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

The anime has a decent story, sadly shortened by the amount of episodes. However this does not spoil the story nor the character development. \r\nThe anime has lovely artwork and a pleasant soundtrack (including the opening and ending theme which are gorgeous!) I find the characters appealing and engaging, also the comedy is rather light hearted and bearable in comparison to many slap-stick alternatives. \r\nI find it hard to not get into this anime considering that it combines comedy, a bit of action, supernatural and romance allin one. Best part is that it's quick to watch and more importantly has a rather satisfying ending. \\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint is that it probably would have been more interesting to have more episodes and extended the development in that duration considering that the characters and story hold so much potential.",

            "content": "-this is my first time writing a review so sorry it's kinda long-\r\n  As a HUGE fan of the manga this anime has to be one of the BIGGEST things I've been looking forward to. I always hoped it would be animated and freaked out the day I found out about it (two days before it aired) \r\n  The story is awesome I recently got into watching/reading anime/manga about youkai/ayakashi/akuma, whatever you want to call them, and when I first read the manga I fell in love with it.\r\nAs for the anime.....one word. AFRIKINAMAZING!!! (yes that counts as one word Xp)There are a lot of funny characters in the series and it's developed pretty well but what really sealed the deal for me was Tomoe....Tomoe Tomoe Tomoe!!!!! I absolutely L O V E his character...sure he seems like an ass in the first few episodes but boy does he grow on you....and keeps growing and growing annnd again GROWING.\\n\r\n  His character design is amazing and his voice -ahhhhhh- fits really well!!! I love his little attitude and just him in general!! He reminds me somewhat of Miketsukami Soushi from (Inu x Boku SS) and Inuyasha put together. He has kind of an attitude like Inuyasha but more of an appearance like Soushi in his 'youkai' form.   *sorry I'm being bias about Tomoe of course I like all the other characters too buut Tomoe and Nanami. That's really what the anime and manga are about*\\n\\n\\n\r\n   All together I have high expectations of this show hope to see a second third fourth and maybe fifth season of this show (hoping the manga last that long and it stays popular)  I recommend this and will recommend this 1,000,000 times to ANYONE who likes this sort of genre of shows.\\n\\n\r\nWatch the show...you'll reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally love it!",

            "content": "With the new season upon us, I thought I'd take the time to re-write a review I once deleted. \r\nThere may be very minor spoilers, so please, be aware.\r\nAh,  Kamisama Kiss. My one and eternal anime-enemy. I didn't think much when starting it, and just thought of it as another one of those shoujo girl-meets-supernatural guy and falls in love. Well, I wasn't necessarily wrong on that aspect. However, diving into it as the episodes moved along, I noticed disturbingly nostalgic details that I've seen before.\r\nStory (60/100)\u2014Nothing too exciting. A regular high school girl gets thrust into a world she is unfamiliar with, andhas to deal with taking the task of handling the moody male main character, having two other men ogling after her, and her feelings overall in the situation. You'd think a supernatural series about a girl unexpectedly becoming a deity would be extremely interesting. \\n\\n\r\nKamisama, is however, not that, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, Kamisama shares traits with one of the anime world's most beloved series\u2014InuYasha. It is not only the story that shares similarities, but the characters and settings as well. I'll try not to drag this review out too long, however, this was the main reason I couldn't enjoy KH. It was too similar. And by that, I don't mean the girl with powers falls in love with demon. I mean almost every detail was, in some way, from InuYasha. That turned me off instantly, and  I dropped it after episode 6, or so. However, keeping an open mind, I picked it up, and finished it once more.\\n\\n\r\nArt (90/100)\u2014The art is beautiful, I'll admit. The animation was fluid, pretty, and flowery\u2014typical of a shoujo. When scenes, such as in the first episode, that tried to have a more 'dark' atmosphere, failed a bit miserably. This series is just a bit too light-hearted to be taken seriously with darker moments. The character designs were a bit generic, however, they were very pretty to look at. One complain I have is that all the girls had an eternal blush\u2014which was very annoying. Other than that, my grievances with the art is very small.\\n\\n\r\nSound (80/100)\u2014The sound was crisp, however, I personally did not enjoy the flowery soundtrack. That is my opinion, but as all series, the soundtracks fit well with what they are assigned to. The seiyuus did an amazing job, despite some of them having very annoying voices. I personally enjoyed hearing Tachibana as Tomoe, as I was used to his high-pitched wailing that is Chiaki from Sekai-ichi Hatsukoi.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (50/100)\u2014 Flat, one-dimensional, and lackluster is what I have to say of these characters. Nanami is a typical shoujo protagonist. In fact, she mirrored that of InuYasha's Kagome\u2014which is to no surprise, as I despised Kagome as well. Not only in back-story, but personality as well. I won't go too into detail on these aspects, though, to avoid making this review even longer.\\n\r\nTomoe is like KH's InuYasha. In appearance, past, and personality. He is the typical shoujo male-protagonist that the girl falls for. \\n\\n\r\nOverall(60/100)\u2014Overall, I did not enjoy this series. It could have been executed so much better, had it not refused to have surgery to be removed as InuYasha's conjoined twin. The new season is doing a much better job of steering away from InuYasha, and thus far, am much more impressed with it.",

Not because of excitement, but of how embarassed I was with how it all turned out. It was sheer horror that such a brilliant manga was reduced to some fleeting anime that was probably made to attract viewers.\r\nWhen comparing it to its manga, I am not impressed with the anime. It seems as if it was made out of the whim with simplistic graphic designs. I mean c'mon,if you're making 13 episodes you could've at LEAST put in some effort to make it more appealing. I'm a tad bit angry that one of my favourite mangas have let me down so much in the anime that I have been eagerly anticipating. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening? It seemed more llike it should've been the ending. Like seiriously...ALL still pictures? are you THAT low on budget? Others might find it suitable for the anime due to the show's \"calm\" nature, but to me it's a sign of laziness. \\n\\n\r\nI'm also not too impressed with Nanami's voice actor, it just...doesn't suit her for some reason. It's better than having those high pitched squeaky voices but there's still just something...off. Her voice I could sort of deal with, but when it came to Onikiri and Kotetsu...mate you've lost me entirely. I'm glad I stopped watching it in order to forget how they sound like.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the manga is a high recommendation from me, just not the anime. In this case, all I can say is that some things are better left for the imagination.",

            "content": "Lion Tamers, Lion Tamers; gather round!\r\nWe take a look at \"Kamisama Hajimemashita\"\r\nAs some of you, who've been reading my reviews know; I have for a long time, been attempting to understand the teenage mind. After all, I was one once, ummm ... around the late 1960's. That was another time. Those were the days when a college graduate could find the United States on a colored World Globe. These days, 48% of college grads can't; actual statistic. In a very real sense, most people of that stripe today; can't find their own butt with both hands. Which explains why some can't properly analyze anime verywell.\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress. Let's get to some themes in \"Kamisama Hajimemashita\" that please and annoy; sometimes both at the same time. Other times, I have to kind of cringe, as sometimes I need to horsewhip the authors of some anime, but I'm never informed as to their actual whereabouts. Or they are not within arms' reach. This leaves me frustrated.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, we need to actually look at this anime with clear eyes, and the mind of a really mean ol' man, and try to figure out exactly what the heck is going on; that has any relation to real life. Silly me, nothing in this show is real life. It's all about that 'wishful thinking' stuff. Or sometimes dumb luck. Yea, that's better.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, we dive in. Firstly, before anyone wants to yell at me for bad-mouthing this anime, there are things I like about this show.\\n\\n\r\n1). The music is almost as cute as the show tries to be.\\n\r\n2). The artwork, while not standout, is good enough.\\n\r\n3). Tomoe is the only character that gets my interest; because he has actual real-life issues.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarities abound, between this anime and another (which is much better, and the jokes are much funnier). I compare 'Kamisama Hajimemashita' with 'xxxHolic'. xxxHolic is much better, in virtually every way; even the educational value is much higher.\\n\\n\r\n1). Does not each have a godlike figure which mentors our primary character?\\n\r\n2). Does not both godlike characters have issues with the primary character?\\n\r\n3). Are there not moments in both shows, where the primary character has severe issues with the godlike character?\\n\r\n4). Does not both primary characters go through dimensional rifts, and visit other world/times/places?\\n\\n\r\nThese are just a short list, but I think you get the idea. I rarely compare anime, but these two really need to be looked at as having plot-points and character references that show clear problems with Kamisama Hajimemashita.\\n\r\n----------------\\n\\n\r\nNow I get to talk about some of the characters.\\n\\n\r\n1). Nanami Momozona\\n\r\nI realize most of you like this girl. And she's a nice enough girl, even to me. But let's see. She is tossed from her home, and lands on a park bench; with no idea what she's gonna do. A land-God gives his job to her, for no explained reason, ever. Nanami has never held any job, has no idea how to carry out a normal job, let alone this new mission.\\n\\n\r\nThen, arriving at the temple, containing the people that help her carry out her mission; she goofs up how it operates, alienates her temple demon (for lot's of true-life reasons), botches relations with the few followers left; and then attempts to play catch-up on all this stuff. Only to botch it all again.\\n\\n\r\nIf not for the few servants and temple demon, she would have destroyed the temple, and these assistants, and hanger, would have been out of a job; and forced to return to the dimension from which they came. Most of them probably much happier.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real problem I have with Nanami, is that she is thrown into deep water without a paddle, or even the knowledge of what to do with the paddle once handed to her. And she never really learns. While she does learn the lessons given to her, she never develops a flair to repackage these new lessons, and re-use them to solve other problems. She always faces each problem with the same wide-eyed ignorance, and has to find each solution the hard way. She always needs Tomoe to help her. Sometimes the entire issue gets handed to his competent hands.\\n\\n\r\n2). Tomoe\\n\r\nWhat a great character he is! This is a guy that initially wanted nothing whatever to do with Nanami, and had given good riddens to Mikage (after Mikage got himself separated from the temple some 20 years before our story begins). When Nanami first arrives, Tomoe is quite happy managing things at the temple, and manages his underlings with efficiency and dispatch.\\n\\n\r\nNanami happens. Moves into the temple, screws up the well oil'd schedule that Tomoe has been tireless in designing. Forcing him eventually to teach her the rudiments of God-hood, tries to teach Nanami to keep schedules, that she finds impossible to keep (even schedules that deal in real-world things, which prove important). Frustrates every attempt to repair the temples' reputation with the public, which Nanami uses her lack of skills to pull the rug out of most of his attempts.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we wonder why Tomoe is so constantly dismayed by his new God-head of the temple. While he eventually becomes charmed by Nanami's simple charm, and quiet acceptance of troubles; the truth is, Tomoe never real becomes satisfied with her progress. Because there is so little of it. Nanami does improve, by small increments and spurts. While Tomoe finds she can dully learn a new idea, truly insightful \"ah ha\" moments are few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nEven he knows, no matter how much he ever learns to like his Temple-God, she is mentally incompetent, and will never really fulfill the promise he so dreams of.\\n\\n\r\n3). Mikage\\n\r\nYou cowardly worm.\\n\\n\r\n4). Mizuki\\n\r\nI realize the girls in the audience just love this guy. But let's please use some common sense. First he tries to destroy the land-God Temple, tries to replace the Land-God as a God of a Water-Temple. Failing that he then decides working for the Land-God, in his mind is just as good as replacing the God of his own Temple.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry, but this guy is a two-faced demon that cannot be relied on in the clutch. Things got tough, and he traitor'd and joined in at Nanami's digs. Any old port in the storm.\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nNow I want to talk about the more mundane production items in the story.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, I want to talk about Nanami Momozono's artwork. I like parts of this characters' personality, but the artwork has lots of problems. She is virtually the only character drawn with the 'big-eyed' look. And the artists went overboard.\\n\\n\r\nIn most artwork of this kind, big-eyed artwork is supplied with an enlarged head to allow for the spacial displacement of the brain. But in Nanami's case, these eye's are at least 2-inches in circumference. Now while viewers who actually like this touch might be dismayed by my attempts at 'pickiness', let's get a little bit real. In this case, they are so large, with no corresponding extra room provided, that I'm afraid that Nanami is not going have much of a frontal lobe. The eyes will intrude on it.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, it explains her lack of concentration, poor memory for times, dates, places; lack of learning skills. She has all of these talents, but they all function in a subpar way. In other words, Nanami is cute, pleasant; and stupid as a fence post.\\n\\n\r\nThe best drawn character has got to be Tomoe. He is slender, powerful (both physically and mentally), a bit mean, sly, and outright clever. He gets more than 100% more attention to his graphic details, than does Nanami. And it's a good thing too; or there would have been nothing in the show to complement for artwork.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the artwork is adequate, sometimes even attractive. But very little in the way of stuff that should stand out. Does this mean the story is bad because of the artwork? No. But the artwork, helped very little. Stick figures would have told the story with equal grace. Except for Tomoe. Even his expressions are done perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nSound and music needs improvement. While the music is cute and lively, even airy and pleasant; it does nothing to inform the viewer of the very strong Japanese religious references and cultural icons that should have been signal'd by it. This young lady becomes a God, a minor one, but a God nonetheless; with all the importance that should have been revolved around. The music failed to indicate anything of importance. Just some cute sentiments about love and friendship, which is true, but pales in importance to the over-arching theme inside the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story. While I realize this story is made to take a tongue-in-cheek look at friendship and romance, the vast majority of the story deals with the events that back-story for the supernatural characters in the show. In other words, the authors placed all the important material in the supernatural, and made the fun, light-friendship, and love-story; the minor theme.\\n\\n\r\nIs this hypocritical? No, but it strongly leads us to a cart-before-the-horse presentation of information, THAT FAILS TO TELL THE STORY. While I liked, very much, the supernatural back stories; they are in fact the secondary plot. The main story is the increasing, over much time; romance developed between Nanami and Tomoe.\\n\\n\r\nAll of that, the romantic elements; while cute and very romantic, are in fact , wrong headed in that they try to force something into place that would never happen in real life. Tomoe is a prisoner of the temple, and slave to his Land-God. He never could, in real life, ever find a way to resolve this. There is not a single theme in his own mind that would allow for friendship and affection. Even after the back-story proves a possible relationship in the offing; he could never settle into a romantic entanglement that imprisons him; not once but twice, by the intentional actions of Nanami.\\n\\n\r\nHe has a right to be viciously angry. Forced to help his God, forced to be the house-servant, forced to be polite at all times, forced to keep the temple from ruin, force to protect the very person that has made him the slave he is.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Nanami never confronts this moral dilemma.\\n\\n\r\nBoth of them trapped in this non-sequitur, for all time. And young people think this is a proper and cute love-story for the ages?\\n\\n\r\nI give \"Kamisama Hajimemashita\" a 7.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm normally not a fan of your typical  comedy/romance/shoujo anime, but I must admit I really loved this one. \r\nNow, the plot may not be that original, but who cares? It's an enjoyable anime, that's more than enough to satisfy the regular viewer.\r\nStory 9/10:A quick synopsis of the anime would be a girl becomes a deity, and get's a familiar. As she starts to train to become a better deity her relationship grows with her familiar. The story is basically set up for a romance theme, and it's quite interesting. There are some cool fight scenes and very good plot lines. It's definitely nota \"unique\" story line, but what matters is it fits into the anime very well. The anime is hilarious at times, and also has touching/adorable moments. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: Aside from the main characters blushing consisting of cross-marks across her face (I can't stand that), everything else about the art is consistent and well done. The characters are appealing, and so is the scenery.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: When you first press that play button, your ears will be gifted with an amazing OP, and then towards the end an amazing ED. They're both soothing to the ear and have great lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: There's a lot of character development as the story progresses. I first assumed no development was occurring because all the characters were in a bit of a slump, but I was relieved when I started to see more growth. Of course, each character has their own back story and they're all pretty interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: I really liked watching this anime, and it's probably the only romance I'll ever watch. I found myself laughing out loud a lot, and I really like the main characters and their personalities. It's not just lovey-dovey things, the characters often stay true to their personalities and that's what is best.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: *I'd recommend this to anyone whose looking for a quick romance anime, with a bit of action.*",

            "content": "So, I've wanted to stop watching this from the first episode, but I do believe in giving a show 3 episodes to sell itself, so I did watch three.\r\nIt did not sell.\r\nThe story is is about high-school girl Nanami who, after being thrown on the streets due to her (now fled) father's gambling debts, gets tricked by a minor god into taking over his position, and is swift to bind the former familiar spirit to her service.\r\nSeeing the high scores of other people for this anime really surprised me. To you that have rated this anything from 8 upwards, have you really nothing better towatch? Did you really consider the plot points of this story and think 'Huh, this is refreshing and well thought-out', or find Nanami's character compelling in any way?\\n\\n\r\nThen again, everyone has equal rights to an opinion. Who knows, maybe the rest of series after episode three really kicks it up a notch (or several) and actually escapes garbage territory. I guess I'll never find out.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's take things one at a time.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\r\nRight off the bat, the story ticks me off. There is not a single ounce of realism to it, to the point where it becomes ridiculous and hard to take with any degree of seriousness.\\n\r\nFirst of all, the idea that an underage high-school girl would be thrown on the street with no consideration from either the state, relatives or acquaintances. Now, one might argue by presenting japanese law that enables this to happen and go on to say that maybe literally no one knew Nanami and her father. Fine. Whatever. I accept this as the premise.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Nanami's blase attitude about being literally homeless. \\n\\n\r\nThen she just casually goes along with some creepy dude who kissed her and told her to go a place she doesn't know right after learning she has nowhere else to go. Because making you a god is exactly what creepy dudes who invite you to their place want to do to you.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the whole, uncomfortable fact of Tomoe's slavery. Because that's what it is. Call it service if you want but that is not accurate, as Tomoe himself did not agree to it, was not willing, and in fact had to be caught by surprise and forced into servitude. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that this is never addressed doesn't matter. It doesn't make it any less of an issue. Despite what anime tells you, being enslaved by a cute high school girl is not okay.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on like this with things from all 3 episodes I watched. The plot for the episode is dreadful, not even trying to make sense or pass its messages with any degree of subtlety or finesse.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, not one single aspect of the Story drew anything from me beyond  irritation.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\r\nThe animation on this is lazy. Skirting the edges of outright bad. It's a serious enough issue that I was thinking about it while watching and breaking immersion (though the plot managed to do that by itself). Not much else to say.  Seen a lot worse, certainly, but most of what I've seen has been better in terms of Art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nGood opening/closing theme, I'll give it that. But beyond that, the music in the actual episode was practically nonexistent, and most of voice-acting was grating, especially the two spirits, the old narrator (whose absence would have done the show a favor) and even Nanami herself to a smaller degree.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nHere comes the crux of my issue with this story.  Perhaps the only character I even remotely like in this anime is Mikage, the creepy dude who scammed a high-school girl into taking over his responsibilities and potentially getting eaten by demons.\\n\\n\r\nNanami's problem is that she's not really a character. There is nothing unique about her. She's a caricature. Caricatures are what you find in terrible anime that think recycling tropes is enough to make a story; it's not.\\n\\n\r\nShe's the age-old stereotype of a dumb, hapless young girl/boy who, despite not really being good at anything, has a heart of gold manages to win people over with her/his earnestness. \\n\r\nWow. I've never seen that one before. And before anyone rushes to protest, my issue isn't that she fits this description, it's only that she literally nothing else to say for herself by episode three.\\n\\n\r\nHell, if something does set her apart, it's that she seems to be dumber than most examples of the stereotype. The first three episodes are nothing beyond a repetition of the same thing: Nanami tries to do something stupid regarding things she literally knows nothing about that will have repercussions and might even get her killed. Tomoe warns her against it, often explaining exactly why the idea is stupid. Nanami does it anyway. Tomoe bails her out. No one mentions how retarded doing the thing was after it happens. Tomoe tends to (for some reason?) get an earful.\\n\\n\r\nThis got annoying to watch very quickly. \\n\\n\r\n  High-school kids are dumb, granted, so that's not unrealistic, but it doesn't make for a very good show if it has nothing to counterbalance it. Stupidity as a character trait is not bad by itself, and is often used in comedic attempts or as a tool for exposition. But when it becomes a plot-driving point, that's when you have an issue.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but Nanami is stubborn and prideful to the point of suicide. This is shown front-and center on episode one. However much you like this anime, however skewed your perception is towards the positive, this is not up for debate. It's literally what happened.\\n\\n\r\nGood for Nanami that she managed to keep her pride but also managed to enslave Tomoe in time for him to save her. I find this particularly ironic, because if the genders were reversed in this situation, I don't think the show would have been received half as well. Double standards, much?\\n\\n\r\nNow, Tomoe I like. I have a penchant towards competent characters, and that's all Tomoe is. Is allowed to be, rather. Competent. At things. In general. By episode three, he hasn't really shown much beyond competence and a plot-forced capacity to forgive both crimes against him as well as sheer, unadulterated stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nThe two spirits are nothing beyond exposition dump, with the occasional attempt at humorous skits, which, in my eyes at least, fail quite spectacularly. Their actual role in the story is never explained, so there's not much else for me to think of them as.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nAll my issues over the plot and the characters and the fact that the show is just a heap of cheap tropes made it really hard to enjoy this. There's nothing that made me feel like watching even this far wasn't a waste of time. If I give it a 2, it's because it's not as offensive a waste as some other things I have watched.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall score is 3/10\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: \"Can't you ignore the things that don't make sense and just enjoy the anime, man?\"\\n\\n\r\nNo.",

            "content": "This anime started strong. with a story that interested me, but after some episodic encounters lost itself.\r\nStory:  This is an interesting set-up, with an average girl being thrust into the position of a god.  Now, a Shinto god isn't necessarily as big a deal as that might sound like; Nanami is just responsible for the small area of the Mikage Shrine, but it's still a pretty big responsibility for somebody who doesn't feel she amounts to much.  And there was much potential here for Nanami to work hard so she grows into her role and finds a new home, but I feltthe anime failed to show that.  Instead of Nanami learning things, Tomoe mostly keeps her out of it, and handles everything himself, and since she isn't happy being kept in the dark, she impulsively does what she wants at the worst possible moments.  Of course she is a plucky little heroine, so she pulls off some unbelievable feats at times, but it all seems quite random to me.  The theme of the show seems to revolve around \"home\" and what that means, but it soon starts bumping into the inevitable shoujo romance, because Tomoe is a hot tsundere with a tragic past.  I am not at all convinced by the romance, those two have to my mind zero chemistry and nothing much in common.  Instead of Nanami getting to know the lay of the land, as it seemed in the initial episodes, we start wasting time at her school, where she sometimes goes and sometimes doesn't, with Tomoe in school drag or not, with another of her small harem and Tomoe glaring at each other...  it was kind of dragging on at that point.  I also don't get what all the interference by camp-gay boy and Mikage is about; they are simultaneously challenging/helping Nanami to grow I guess, but it too is random.  Nothing in the story seems very well thought through.\\n\\n\r\nArt (4/10):  Nothing much to write home about.  I especially didn't care for Nanami's design.  All the boys are of course meant to be hot, and do at least have clearly distinguished designs.  The animation is fairly minimal. \\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10):  The more traditional Japanese BGM fit the story well. I didn't care for the OP, but the ED was interesting.  Some of the voice talent didn't seem to fit its roles very well, and in general nobody stood out for me.  I found the narrator annoying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4/10): Nanami started out with potential, but I found her development much too uneven.  Tomoe really had the best development, though not everything made sense either -- for somebody who once couldn't bear to be touched by a human, he is awfully free with touching random women, and that is of course played for jealousy on Nanami's side; but it feels like such an artificial thing.  Other character development is too abrupt to feel natural, and so Mizuki and Karuma just become harem characters instead of decent characters on their own merit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10):  I enjoyed the first few episodes, but then that fell off.  I don't care about the romance at all because Nanami is such an undeveloped personality that I don't see what Tomoe would ever see in her (other than that she is obviously related to his first true love, so maybe he sees some echo there).  Yukiji was clearly meant to be a Yamato Nadeshiko, because what else could get a youkai to reject his old ways, but I don't see Nanami in the same light.",

I for one really enjoy romance and shoujo, and this anime really hit the jackpot. Even though it was really center around only one male protagonist, it was still very enjoyable for me. \r\n[ART]\r\n-----------\r\nThe graphics were fantastic, and it was really high quality, adding that the scenery was well detailed as well. \r\n[SOUND]\r\n-----------\r\nI have watched both dubbed and subbed for this anime, and the voice actors / actresses really did a fantastic job of showing emotions in their character, especially Tomoe, Momozono, and Kurama. Even so, I don't remember hearing much background music when it wasreally needed. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThe characters were extremely cute, especially Tomoe and Momozono. They both had cute chibi moments and romantic moments. Even when they are serious, the producers really did a good job of showing their emotions that they want to show. Kurama was an interesting character. He had this very 'dark' appearance, making me think that he'll stay an antagonist throughout the whole series, but I was wrong. I guess you really can't judge a character by their looks. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThe story had a really good plot, and they really did a good job when it came to the main characters by passing their obstacles and adventures. The love Momozono had for Tomoe really made me want to keep watching the whole series, including season 2 and the Kako-hen as well. Their romantic scenes really made me hope that they would eventually fall in love with each other and have a happy ending of this series, but you'll have to watch yourself what really happens.\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI wrote this review after I watched the whole series, including the Kako-hen and the Kamisama, Shiawase ni Naru part, so I don't really remember which events were in this anime of the series, although, I do prefer the 2nd season over the 1st, because it had a lot more interesting plots on the story, although season 1 was still fantastic and enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE:\\n\r\n9/10",

            "content": "I didn't have much expectation for this anime to begin with but from what I saw, it was actually decent and cute; something you would expect from anything involving a female high school student and a kitsune-type character. Throw in a few extra men just to make the love interest realize his feelings, and the formula of a good romantic comedy is complete. \r\nThe story isn't complicated whatsoever. In fact, it's incredibly basic and easy to understand. Even with the few snippets of backstory that was shown, you can piece together a few things. The animation was nice and somehow suited the love interests characteras well as the main. As for character development-wise I felt like they tried way, way too hard to make Nanami a mixture between a Mary Sue (basically a character with no flaws) and your typical average shoujo klutz. Though, it is cute to see Tomoe rescue her all the time so I can't have too many complaints. I just wish she could have been a bit stronger as a character -- then again, it only has 13 episodes. Sigh, only when it's over do you realize that where you started out with no expectations, you slowly begin to expect a little something, whatever that may be.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was slightly disappointing for reasons that I won't bother going into due to spoiling the ending. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I didn't feel that watching this anime was a waste of time.

            "content": "This is a review of both season 1 and 2 of Kamisama Hajimemashita, since they were pretty much the same in terms of quality. \r\nOverall Enjoyment- 8/10 Very Good - The best aspect of Kamisama Hajimemashita is definitely the two main characters and how they overcome obstacles and grow closer to each other. The other elements (plot, music, and animation) were enjoyable as well. I have rewatched this series 3 times, and is my favorite anime of all time as a shoujo lover, and is by far among the top 2 best romantic shoujos I have watched, Akatsuki No Yona being the other. The overallseries goes up to a 9/10 if you include the OVAs. \\n\\n\r\nPlot overall- 8/10  Very Good - Nanami suddenly becomes a deity who learns her responsibilities to her worshipers and shrine, fend off attacks from dark beings, overcome the stigma of being a mortal deity, meanwhile managing school, and having fun with friends along the way. She gets help from others in her endeavors, but most of the help comes from her fox familiar (guardian), Tomoe, who has a mysterious and intriguing past that is explored. The main themes are overcoming obstacles with determination, fighting for the people you care about, being kind and helping others, truly and selflessly loving someone, and finding the place and people you belong with. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few adventurous plot arcs of varying lengths, but the plot remains interesting or at least fun even in episodes where there is a reprieve from big obstacles. Still, I can't help but think the plot could have been developed a little better. \\n\\n\r\nRomance- 8/10 Very Good - I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but the romance was lovely! I couldn\u2019t get over how beautiful and sweet it was! This is technically considered a reverse harem because there are several characters who have a crush on or fall in love with Nanami at different points, but they\u2019re all not around her in every episode and it isn\u2019t a big part of the plot since Nanami has her sights on only one guy. Later, in the OVAs my romance rating goes up to a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nMain characters- 8/10 Very Good - Nanami is sweet, caring, and very conscious of her duties. She does not like being a burden on others, so she gets tough, brave, and clever when she faces obstacles. She can hold her own well and doesn\u2019t always need someone to swoop in. The ratio of her saving/helping others and her being helped/saved by others is pretty equal, which is a beautiful balance, and a great lesson to learn. Tomoe is quiet and acts like he doesn\u2019t care about much, but goes above and beyond his duties as a familiar and also cares deeply for Nanami. Overall, Tomoe\u2019s character has a lot of depth and Nanami\u2019s qualities are endearing.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting characters- 6/10 Fair -The supporting characters were often used as comic relief and occasional aids to Nanami. Sadly, I feel ambivalent towards most of the supporting characters because quite a few of them felt\u2026 underdeveloped in my opinion even though some of them got backstories.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 7/10 Good -The animation wasn\u2019t breathtaking and was just average, so I was content. There were some character designs that were much more visually pleasing than others, but no one looked appalling. They do pay attention to little details on characters at times, such as the disinterested curves of Tomoe\u2019s lips, which I appreciated. The chibi forms of characters during joke scenes are the best! My only gripe was that Nanami\u2019s character design made her look a lot younger than she is.\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Voice Acting- 8/10 Very Good - Loved the opening/closing songs of both seasons! The songs were are upbeat, catchy, and cute which perfectly matched Nanami\u2019s personality. The background music was okay overall. There\u2019s a rock star character and the songs he sang were ok, but weren\u2019t something I would care to listen to again. There was a lovely instrumental background song that paired wonderfully with romantic scenes. I thought all the voice actors cast for the characters were either appropriate or perfect overall, from Tomoe to even the minute characters who had only a few lines. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Please make sure you watch the OVAs especially the Kako Hen episodes! They are extremely important to the overall plot, explain any lingering questions or things you missed in the seasons, and wrap everything up so nicely. \\n",

            "content": "Okay so to start off this anime is my top anime, so I may be slightly biased. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story kinda started off as a main occurrence then expanded into some side stories. The manga's storyline is better of course, but the anime has an enjoyable storyline as well. You will not be lacking a lovely dose of gods or traditional clothing mixed in with some mythology. \r\nArt: 9/10\r\nI guess the art could have been better, but overall the art was very cute and pleasing to watch. It was done in a shoujo-like style, with the females possessing large eyes and the males having smaller,sharper eyes. \\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe background audio and the voice acting were both spectacular. I ecspecially enjoyed the voice acting though. I believe the voice actors match the characters personas in a wonderful way. Although please register that I'm talking about the Japanese voice actors, because in all honesty most American voice actors sound like rubbish in anime. \\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI love the characters. You start off with Nanami, who has just lost everything being thrown into a new world, and then there's Tomoe who is kinda tsundere-ish in characteristics. They have comedic arguments once in a while as well. The characters all have lovely personalities that grow on you at one point or another. Also I enjoyed Nanami's emotional development in the anime. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is where I become extremely biased. I totally end entirely loved this anime because it had traditional clothing incorporated with mythology and gods. I really loved watching this anime. \\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 \\n\r\nIt had everything I looked for in an anime. Which is traditional clothing, mythology, and a cute romantic interest.",

First of all, I'd been plenty away from the usual shoujo, slice of life, romance that it hit me hard how much I'd missed it watching Kamisama Hajimemashita. It's simply a perfect anime to watch during free time because you can't really take it seriously and just fangirl at the otp, which I have the urge to state, but must resist. I hadn't shipped so hard in months, but in this anime, I was screaming inside (cause I'd watch at night) hoping the otp would just admit their undying love for each other. I'd be screaminglike a dying whale if I watched during the day, really. You will understand the abundance and extremity of fanservice of this anime. No more comment. Other than that, the characters are adorable, every single one. Characer development was much better than story progression imo, but character development made up for it by making you forget what the heck is even going on the story. Music is very memorable to me too. The theme songs have a bit of a sexy tone and its really cute and I love that little track that comes on for every touchy moment, which goes for every shoujo anime, but I had to say it :)You will fall in love with the main guy character. He's freakin' beautiful.... liek, how can you not ? ;^; ENJOY THE SHOW ~",

There were moments where I anticipated what was going to happen but instead I was left in tears of laughter from the comedy side of this anime. \r\nI don't really think there is any real flaw in Kami-sama Hajimemashita. The only thing that I dislikeabout it is the fact that there are only 13 episodes, however, for an anime that is short and has an ongoing manga it is tied up pretty well and doesn't leave you with that sense of disappointment you get with most animes that are short and sweet. \\n\\n\r\nI know a lot of anime fans out there dislike the heroines in animes that don't play much of a role in the story line but for this particular female protagonist you will find she actually does a lot and isn't a hopeless damsel in distress :)",

The difference between Kamisama Hajimemashita and other animes in terms of character was that the lead, nanami, was LIKEABLE. All of the characters were done very well but Nanami really caught my attention. yes she had some of  THOSE traits (bossy, clumsy etc.) but she was also funny, hardworking and persistent.Tomoe another main is theaudience getter, he's very cliche. He's possessive, arrogant (bordering mean) and saves Nanami in basically every episode. It's the regular anime guy persona but i'm a regular teenage girl and honestly, that's what i like to see. Despite the shortness of the anime the characters do develop and change. \\n\\n\r\nstory. this is really the most important part isn't it?  A young human girl becomes the a land god of a shrine and has to basically deal with her daily life as a god and a student. Oh and spoiler alert she falls in love with her familiar (Tomoe) who she's now living with. So it's simple. But it's alos sweet, funny and has places to go which can make a simple story refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art.  i'm not particularly versed in the dos and don'ts of anime artwork, but i do know what looks visually appealing. kamisama hajimemashita is better than many but far from perfect. in my opinion, Kamisama Hajimemashita looked good.\\n\\n\r\nfinal topic; sound. there really was none.. which is why i think this is Kamisama Hajimemashita greatest downfall. you had an ending, you had an opening which were very catchy i'll admit, but that was it. \\n\\n\r\nI liked this anime because i'm cliche. The creators knew what i liked and they delivered. A story with magic, an attractive male lead, a female lead who didn't annoy me and a heavy load of romance. That is why i think Kamisama Hajimemashita is outstanding, it was enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nYou should watch Kamisama Hajimemashita. It's short. i watched all 13 episodes in a day so spend a day (or maybe a few if you have a life) and enjoy this little gem of an anime. \\n\\n\r\ni hope for another season of Kamisama Hajimemashita!",

It lays on the cute boys like chocolate on a sundae and you don't get sick of it! The writers were tactful with how thick they laid on the boys so that it reaches a perfect consistence. You aren't left feeling like \u201cUgh this girl is useless\u201d or\u201cUgh fan service.\u201d they had a perfect harmony. There are times that will make you go \u201cNO WHY!?\u201d and later you're left saying \u201cNyaaaaa~\u201d. For my shipper friends out there you could easily ship the heroine with any of the guys and no one could really complain! (I mean they will anyway but that's just shippers in general) Yaoi fangirls could easily go to town here too but there really isn't anything the could use to justify the pairings really.

To be honest, at first I thought the storyline was simple, but then later on in the series it became more complex and unique. \r\nART - 10\r\nThe art is amazing. The characters were beautifully drawn, they all lookpicture-perfect. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9\\n\r\nI watched the english dubbed version (please don't judge me..

They made the characters' persona more solid and their acting made me connect with the show more. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 10\\n\r\nThe characters were relatable and I really like that in the shows that I watch. They have their own unique strengths and weaknesses, and the struggle to make things better for themselves and the people around them it very touching.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\r\nI bindge-watched this anime all night, I didn't expect to be hooked after just one episode! \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 10\\n\r\nI didn't expect to like this show as much as I wanted to when I first started watching this. I usually shy away from ultra-cheesy stuff.. but this one is sweet without being overly-sweet to the point of getting cavities. It's a feel-good aniime about love and friendship, and I like it a lot.\\n",

            "content": "So, recently, I've been getting into some older anime\u2014and when I say older, I don't mean 90s anime. I just mean they're anime I missed a few years ago.\r\nKamisama Kiss is the story of Nanami Momozono, who, in the English dub is voiced by my favorite VA, Tia Ballard. Nanami's father has just run away from his massive gambling debt, and Nanami has been evicted from their apartment. Alone and without a home, Nanami seems like she's about to give up, but then she finds a man who's stuck in a tree after having been chased there by a dog.\r\nNanami rescues the man, and theman, after hearing her story, tells her that she can stay at his place and kisses her on the forehead. Little did Nanami know at the time that the place where that man lived was actually a shrine. She also didn't know that him kissing her forehead wasn't just some fatherly-ish act. We soon learn that Nanami has become a land god. The man who kissed her forehead is named Mikage, and he was the previous land god who lived at this shrine.\\n\\n\r\nIt's during Nanami's first trip to the shrine that we meet the love interest. Tomoe is a fox yokai who served as Mikage's familiar. He's none too pleased when, instead of Mikage showing up, it's Nanami. When he learns that she is the new land god, he becomes furious, stating that no weak and frail human girl could ever become a land god. He then leaves, claiming he's done being Mikage's pet.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that struck me about this anime was that it's very shojo. The beginning part of this series reminds me of how most shojo anime go. You've got the girl who is down on her luck in some manner, and then you have the standoffish male love interest who treats her like crap. This is a typical plotline within the shojo genre.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, this story deviates very quickly from what I consider to be standard shojo plots. After Nanami has a run in with a hag yokai, she manages to bind Tomoe as her familiar. Tomoe then undergoes a near miraculous transformation. He cooks, he cleans, he even helps teach Nanami about what her duties are going to be as a land god. Of course, he still has moments where he makes fun of her, but it doesn't have the same harshness that other shojo anime have.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the aspects about this anime that I enjoyed the most was its humor. Now, I enjoy laughing. I'd rather be laughing than crying any day. However, few anime manage to truly make me laugh. I might smile on occasion, but only the seriously funny anime can make me bust a gut.\\n\\n\r\nKamisama Kiss is not an anime that makes me laugh. However, the humor it has does bring a smile to my face. I enjoyed watching the comedic dynamic between Tomoe and Nanami. It's always funny when Tomoe does something kind for Nanami, which makes her think he must really care for her\u2014until she notices the evil eyes he's giving her. The constant jokes are also what I think served to elevate this series above other shojo anime with similar plots.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Nanami has become a land god and must do her best to learn her duties, she is also a teenage girl, and, being a teenage girl, that means she also must go to school. One thing that's interesting about Nanami is how her peers see her. It seems as if everyone knows about her dead beat dad and that she's poor as dirt.\\n\\n\r\nDuring her first day back at school after becoming a land god, Nanami meets Kurama... no, I don't mean that Kurama. I mean this Kurama.\\n\\n\r\nKurama is a popular idol that all the teenage girls adore\u2014sort of like a less disgusting, chuunibyo version of Justin Beiber. He has large, black wings on his back, which he claims are there because he's a fallen angel. In truth, he's actually a crow tengu\u2014a legendary creature that takes the firm of a bird of prey. In the Shinto religion, they are thought to be either a god or a yokai.\\n\\n\r\nHe first treats Nanami like crap. Naturally, because all pop idols are douchebags. However, after learning that she's the land god, Kurama tries to get back on her good side so he can eat her powers and become the next land god. We're probably lucky he was thwarted by Tomoe. I mean, if our main heroine had died, we wouldn't have much of an anime, would we?\\n\\n\r\nLater in the series, Kurama ends up falling for Nanami, for the same reason most females end up falling for a harem protagonist. I'd like to say that Kurama helped form a strange love triangle between him, Nanami, and Tomoe, but the truth is that several more men fall for Nanami. I suppose you could say there's a small case of reverse harem in the series. Saying that, the only person who Nanami has eyes for is Tomoe. I really do pity all the other guys in this series. Well, not really, but you know.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, this anime had both good and bad qualities to it. I enjoyed how it differentiates itself from the shojo genre, and I enjoyed the stylized art. The art has the same feel as anime like Fruits Basket and Kimi ni Todoke. At the same time, the animation was pretty standard. There was nothing really special about it, and I feel like they cut a lot of corners of the animation during its production.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps my biggest issue is how the series itself is incomplete. The manga series that Kamisama Kiss is based on has been completed, but the anime seems to have ended without finishing. This gives the series an incomplete feel that leaves me wanting. As fun as the anime was, the ending itself was unsatisfying.\\n\\n\r\nI still believe this anime is worth watching, even if you aren't the shojo genre. Its got a decent amount of humor, the romance is sweet, and while I can't relate to Tomoe because I sometimes feel like he's too perfect, Nanami is a very relatable character.",

            "content": "The Tomoe Show!\r\nAn observation: almost every self-proclaimed Kamisama fan I've come across just so happens to also be a gigantic Tomoe fan. This begs the question: are there that many fans of the SHOW, or are there just a lot of Tomoe fan(girls)? It's definitely the latter.\r\nAnd therein lies the problem with Kamisama. If you're like me, who is very much outside the target audience, and doesn't have cartoon hearts appear in my eyes every time Tomoe is on-screen, this show is probably not going to blow you away. I've seen plenty of good shoujo, but I cannot in good conscious add this particular entryto the list.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start off with my largest grievance of the show: the main character. The primary reason I think shoujo does high school romance anime better than their non-shoujo counterparts is because there are so many excellent leads in the genre (see: my favorite character list). Nanami, however, is not one of them. The fact she starts off homeless and is sort of \"rescued\" by a fox familiar and they form this unusual duo is somewhat compelling on the surface; but unfortunately that's where the praise stops. So she quickly develops feelings for our fox-boy, and that's when things really go awry for her character. Anytime Tomoe as much as looked at another girl, it's like \"here we go again\". The jealousy, the attitude, the pouting. Ugh. All for someone who you are not romantically involved with in any way. When she learns that he once loved a human, despite him telling her he could never do such a thing, she basically uses that information to BLACKMAIL him into going on a date with her. (btw, there's a good reason he didn't tell her). Ugh. For the most part, Nanmi just came off as a childish, selfish, petulant brat who had a school-girl crush on the hot fox-boy. Not only that, but she more or less lost all sense of self or individuality, as this crush consumed her. She simply became, like most of the audience, \"the girl that liked Tomoe\". Nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nNow, onto Tomoe. It's tough to render an opinion when he's a character that was very clearly not made with me in mind. In a way, I feel like he's the male version of Holo from Spice and Wolf. Half-animal? Check? Hot? Check? Slightly tsundere? Check. Deity? Check. Basically created for the sole purpose of being the perfect anime waifu/husbando. \\n\\n\r\nNone of the other characters really stood out for me except for possibly Mizkuki . He's definitely quite a bit more whimsical than Tomoe, which I actually liked, because Tomoe was kind of a sour-puss for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the other stuff, like the story, visuals, and sound, I don't have a ton to say. There wasn't much \"meat\" to the story, and the visuals/sound didn't stand out to me in any way, bad or good.\\n\\n\r\nBut again, that's not really the headliner here. This is very much a show that was going to live or die on the strength of the two main characters: Minami, the self-insert character, and Tomoe, the ultimate husbando. If those two things are enough for you to rate this pretty run-of-the-mill shoujo a 9 or 10, then by all means, do that. Because there's just not much of actual substance besides that.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said all that, it is not awful, just slightly below average. There are some funny moments in the show, as despite its \"demons\" tag, it's actually a very light-hearted series. As mediocre a main character as I thought Minami was overall, her interactions with the familiars were at times were entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: There are no Kamisama fans, just Tomoe fans (ok that's hyperbole, but you get my point)\\n",

She saved Mikage and told him her story. He gave his house to Nanami as a thank you. Sheaccepted the offer because she was homeless. When Nanami arrived at Mikage home, she learned Mikage used to be the Earth Deity of the shrine and he gave her his mark so that she was the new deity. At first Nanami is reluctant, but as she lives with Tomoe, Onikiri and Kotetsu she begins to understand and works hard in her new position as the Earth Deity. As the story progresses Nanami finds herself falling in love with Tomoe, but he rejects her because the love between a human and a yokai is taboo. Despite saying that, Tomoe finds himself falling in love with her too.\\n\\n\r\n[Art & Sound] 9~\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the soundtrack is awesome, both opening and ending sound really good, I can't remove it from my head... \"nee kamisama, warui ko ni naritai yo...\". I found the art so beautiful, it reminds me to the art that Noragami have.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters] 10~\\n\\n\r\nI love the way that all the characters have it point. All of they are so funny but they have an history that can hit your kokoro.\\n\\n\r\nTomoe: It's one of the main characters. Is a fox. It has a difficult temperament and is very strict, but he's also friendly and obedient.\\n\\n\r\nMomozono Nanami: The other main character. She is warm, friendly and gentle. Despite her human condition, and little spiritual power in the beginning, she is able to change people with great determination and kindness, making them see the right way and helping them with their problems.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 10~\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. I can't wait to see the second season.\\n\\n",

It is very rare to find such a good anime as this! I am completely in love with everything in this anime, both the manga and the series were masterpieces. The story is extremely cute and fun 9/10\r\nCharacters are drawn very neatly and enjoyable to look at. All the characters are beautiful and unique in their own way. Plus, all the boys are either hot or cute. Heheh 10/10\r\nThe music in the series is quite good and I likedthe voices of the characters. They were very calming and sweet. The voices showed just the right amount of emotion the character felt at that moment. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are one of the most important things that make this anime so good. Their pasts are all very mysterious. The characters themselves are very unique and fun. There're not a single character that is boring in any way. All of them are very worthy and should be protected at all costs. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime gave me a lot of feels. The small feels were just as important as the major ones. It is a very heart-warming anime. It has a lot of cute moments, comedy, action, and more. I wish the next season would come out faster. I can't wait for it!! The enjoyment is 10/10 of course.\\n\\n\r\nSo my overall of this anime is 10/10. I recommend it all the people that are romance, comedy, and fantasy lovers, because this anime will be your paradise! I want to write in caps, but i am not supposed to smh\\n",

            "content": "- English Review (Translated version)\r\nI had quite a few hopes for \"Kamisama Kiss\". Seriously. I was attracted to the atmosphere and the thematic: traditional Japanese folklore, a pinch of real world mixed with legends, divinities, spirits... Doesn't sound bad at all, right? Saving the distances, its bases reminded me of \"Noragami\", an anime that I have enjoyed quite a lot (without being a masterpiece).\r\nOkay, where's the problem then? Maybe I should intone the \"mea culpa\" in this case. Maybe I should have informed myself a little beyond the environment of \"Kamisama Kiss\" to understand that it's basically a romance story, a shojo. A pure andhard shojo, I might add. Excessively shojo, probably.\\n\\n\r\nI am not against the inclusion of love in anime (or in any audiovisual piece). On the contrary, I think it is something natural and basic in life and as such should be shown. I insist... Where is the fault then? On which \"Kamisama Kiss\" bases its plot so much on the romance between the protagonists, and it forgets everything else and ends up clogging up. A lot. As if you eat tons of chocolate every day and finally you hate it for having insisted so much.\\n\\n\r\n\"Kamisama Kiss\" has a lot of totally wasted elements, which is very sad thing. As I said, it has a japanese folklore based atmosphere, full of supernatural creatures. Yes, a ambience that is not taken advantage of at any time. Let's be serious, if this packaging were removed, the whole plot could be exactly the same with a couple of arrangements. This is very frustrating, because this japanese background of legend is really taken care of and well accomplished (the music is great, for example), but everything is for nothing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd we come to the characters. There are two main characters, Nanami and Tomoe. Nanami is the typical girl inclined to fall in love, clumsy, but with a good heart. Tomoe is the typical attractive, with a stormy past, but he hides kindness inside. Well... they are not the most original thing in the world, but at least the secondary ones will be more varied. Secon... what? \"Kamisama Kiss\" starts and ends in both of them. There are a short group of minor characters that appear from time to time, whose transcendence is really null and they are there because of the demands of the script. Stop counting. As I said, the lack of use of resources is maximum and in the section of characters is no different.\\n\\n\r\nNot everything is bad. The technical section is a great result and the music have a quite high level. And I suppose that whoever likes pure and hard romances, without any kind of variety or nuances, will enjoy this anime, but this is not my case. I won't stop complaining about what might have been, but it wasn't. A pity.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\\n\\n\r\nTen\u00eda bastantes esperanzas puestas en \"Kamisama Kiss\". En serio. Me atra\u00eda la ambientaci\u00f3n y la tem\u00e1tica: folklore tradicional japon\u00e9s, una pizca de mundo real mezclado con leyendas, divinidades, esp\u00edritus... \u00bfNo suena nada mal, no? Salvando las distancias sus bases me recordaban a \"Noragami\", un anime que he disfrutado bastante (sin ser ninguna obra maestra).\\n\\n\r\nVale, \u00bfd\u00f3nde est\u00e1 el problema entonces? Quiz\u00e1 deba entonar el \"mea culpa\" en este caso. Quiz\u00e1 deber\u00eda haberme informado un poco m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la ambientaci\u00f3n de \"Kamisama Kiss\" para darme cuenta que b\u00e1sicamente es una historia sobre romance, un shojo. Un shojo puro y duro, deber\u00eda a\u00f1adir. Excesivamente shojo probablemente.\\n\\n\r\nNo estoy en contra de la inclusi\u00f3n de amor en el anime (ni en ninguna obra audiovisual). Al contrario, creo que es algo natural y b\u00e1sico en la vida y como tal debe mostrarse. Insisto... \u00bfd\u00f3nde est\u00e1 el fallo pues? En que \"Kamisama Kiss\" basa tanto su trama en el romance entre los protagonistas que olvida todo lo dem\u00e1s y termina por empalagar. Mucho. Como si comieras kilos de chocolate cada d\u00eda y finalmente lo aborrecieras por haber insistido tanto con ello.\\n\\n\r\n\"Kamisama Kiss\" tiene un mont\u00f3n de elementos totalmente desaprovechados, lo cual es una pena. Como comentaba, tiene una ambientaci\u00f3n basada en el folklore japon\u00e9s, repleta de criaturas sobrenaturales. S\u00ed, una ambientaci\u00f3n a la que no se le saca partido en ning\u00fan momento. Seamos serios, si quitaran este envoltorio toda la trama podr\u00eda ser exactamente igual con un par de arreglos. Esto es muy triste, porque este marco nip\u00f3n de leyenda est\u00e1 verdaderamente cuidado y conseguido (la m\u00fasica es genial, por ejemplo), pero todo es para nada.\\n\\n\r\nY llegamos a los personajes. Est\u00e1n los dos protagonistas, Nanami y Tomoe. Nanami es la t\u00edpica chica enamoradiza, patosa, pero de buen coraz\u00f3n. Tomoe es el t\u00edpico guapete, con un pasado tormentoso, pero que esconde bondad en su interior. Bueno... no son lo m\u00e1s original del mundo, pero al menos los secundarios ser\u00e1n m\u00e1s variados. \u00bfSecu... qu\u00e9? \"Kamisama Kiss\" acaba y empieza en ellos dos. Hay un pu\u00f1ado de personajes que aparecen de vez en cuando, cuya trascendencia en realidad es nula y est\u00e1n ah\u00ed por exigencias del guion. Para de contar. Como ya he dicho, la falta de aprovechamiento de recursos es m\u00e1xima y en el apartado de personajes no es diferente.\\n\\n\r\nNo todo es malo. El apartado t\u00e9cnico es result\u00f3n y la m\u00fasica tiene un nivel bastante alto. Y supongo que a quien le gusten los romances puros y duros, sin ning\u00fan tipo de variedad ni matiz, disfrutar\u00e1 de este anime, pero no es mi caso. Yo no dejar\u00e9 de lamentarme de lo que podr\u00eda haber sido, pero no fue. Una pena.",

            "content": "First Impression:\r\nThe first thought that came to mind when I started watching this anime was, \u201cCute\u201d. It is mainly a romance and comedy anime. You can tell by first glance that this is an anime directed toward a more female audience. The plot is revealed rather quickly and is easy to understand. It doesn\u2019t leave room for confusing and makes for a more relaxing watch. The only \u2018First Impression\u2019 down side I had was the the lack of an \u2018originality\u2019 vibe. Though I have not seen an anime with this particular storyline, it feels slightly played out.\r\nDespite the lack of this vibe, however, I didenjoy this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyments:\\n\r\nWhat I enjoyed, and you might as well, was the expressions of the Genre(s). The romance was well paced and enjoyable as well as the Comedy. I, personally, am very picky when it comes to what makes me laugh, however this anime did have me laughing time and time again.\\n\r\nI also enjoyed the two main characters (though my favorite is Tomoe) as well as the storyline/plot. Despite it lacking the \u2018originality\u2019 vibe, it was still a very appealing plot to me. I enjoyed the struggles that the main female character had because of her humanity, as well as the pace of the entire anime as a whole.\\n\r\nLast but not least, I also did enjoy the animation style. It wasn\u2019t too extravagant and yet it was well done in its own simplistic way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDownsides:\\n\r\nI have already stated one downside which was the lack of the anime feeling original. Aside from not feeling very original, it also lacked suspense. It did not seem to have that gripping sensation that some animes have. You might know the ones I am talking about; the ones that cause you to keep saying, \u201cJust one more episode\u201d after every single one you watch. \\n\r\nThough I did enjoy the anime\u2019s romance, which I thought to be cute, was a little clich\u00e9. It was mildly predictable; part of that simplistic aspect I mentioned previously.\\n\r\nThe last downside I have to  mention is the lack of brain power it takes. I, personally, like an anime that takes a little more time to be figured out. Despite this, as well as the other mentioned downsides, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and these \u2018downsides\u2019 weren\u2019t all that large of an issue. Don\u2019t let them get in the way of being what makes you enjoy a little gem like this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOther Information:\\n\r\nOverall I truly loved this anime. I thought it was adorable and will definitely be watching the second season. I enjoyed it so much that I am actually reading the Manga. It is within my taste (though I know everyone has different \u2018buds\u2019). Though I give this anime an eight out of ten, you should decide for yourself if you enjoyed(will enjoy) this anime.",

            "content": "I'll be honest, I had very low expectations when I started this, but this anime was surprisingly good! I ended up watching the whole series in 2015. I watched this series almost immediately after Noragami, which had similar themes, but I preferred this to Noragami. (sorry fans). BTW, this is my first review, so I'm sorry if its bad.\r\nSTORY- 9\r\nThis really isn't a typical \"junior high\" love story. I thoroughly enjoyed that, it has some lighthearted scenes, supernatural elements, and a girl rendered homeless stuck in the middle of it all. The deity part isn't really fresh, but still, compared to the genres of animepreferred these days, it was a good break for me.\\n\\n\r\nART- 7\\n\r\nAverage, all I have to say about it. But those chibi scenes were adorable!\\n\\n\r\nSOUND-8\\n\r\nI liked both the openings and endings, they gave out a great vibe to them! I never skipped them. Kurama the fallen angel sang the ED in one episode and lol there's no way I'm gonna hate that.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS-9\\n\r\nI liked the characters a lot! They're all lovable in their own ways...\\n\\n\r\nNanami- She's the main protagonist, your typical teenager. Not much of character development, except her feelings for tomoe and increase in confidence, but I still liked her!\\n\\n\r\nTomoe- Where do I begin?! Tomoe was my favourite character in the show! In the beginning, he's mean, because Nanami is unable to fulfill her duties as a Land God. As the series progresses, he gets nicer towards Nanami, protecting her at all times and also gets jealous when the snake yokai gets friendly with her. (*ahem*male tsundere)\\n\r\nHe has a pretty interesting backstory, you can check that out, I won't spoil it ;)\\n\\n\r\nKurama- I LOVED THIS GUY! During tense events, you can always count on Kurama to relieve the tension with his behavior and attitude. As the series progresses, he gets more humble though, but still, fallen angel from hell.\\n\\n\r\nI really don't have much to say about the other characters, but they were all great. A lively lot indeed!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL-9\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to take a break from anime with darker themes, or who wants to try out more shoujo-geared anime!\\n",

            "content": "Kamisama Hajimemashita, or Kamisama Kiss is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Julietta Suzuki and serialized by Hakusensha in the shoujo manga magazine called \u2018Hana to Yume.\u2019 An anime television series adaptation of Kamisama Kiss was produced by \u2018TMS Entertainment\u2019 and directed by Akitaro Daichi (Fruits Basket, Kaleido Star). It began airing on October 1, 2012. There are also two OVA episodes, which first aired on August 26, 2013, bundled with the 16th volume of the manga. One of the included episodes is based on the story from the 15th volume, while the other contains an all-new original story. The 17th issue ofHakusensha's Hana to Yume magazine announced on August 2014 that the manga series inspired a second anime season, which began airing on January 5, 2015.\\n\\n\r\nMomozono Nanami is only 17 years old, but she has never felt lucky. She has quite an average academic progress and boys do not think that she is cute. She would love to fix her school problems and spare more time for the girls\u2019 stuff, but she cannot do that, since her father is a big gambler, who always causes her daughter a ton of problems. Too bad, but her misfortune only continues: she is evicted from her apartment, because of her father\u2019s debts. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Nanami does not curse her misfortune. One day, she saves a good-looking young man in a park from a huge phobia he has; he is afraid of dogs. After a small talk, the young man listens to Nanami\u2019s problems and offers her to live at his place, which he abandoned 20 years ago. In addition to this, he also kisses her on the forehead to express his gratitude. It turns out that Nanami is invited to live in a God\u2019s shrine and that the young man that kissed her actually passed her the mark of the area\u2019s deity. The unfortunate girl is no longer unfortunate, but her life has not gotten any easier, too. She now should take care of her academic progress, as well as of her deity\u2019s duties. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Kamisama Kiss\u2019 story-line does look generic, it still manages to show its uniqueness. The story-line does a great job explaining characters\u2019 motives and their backstories, but the most important thing about it is, of course, the fact that it manages to keep the viewer interested. Kamikiss is a romantic comedy, however, sometimes it gets very dark and it also focuses on some philosophical topics. And after some time you will surely appreciate the fact that the creator of Kamikiss understands that watching a pure romantic comedy for two seasons is just boring and that she can also make you forget about the romance and to make you simply worry about the characters of Kamikiss. However, after 19 minutes of fear you hear the anime\u2019s ending song and understand that it is all over. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are not great, but there is nothing to complain about. Backgrounds are often gorgeous and the anime also pays attention to many important details. Sound wise, it is quite difficult to say if this anime should be watched in English, or in Japanese; they both are good, so feel free to watch it in whatever language you wish. The anime has also a very calming OST; whenever you hear the anime\u2019s ending, it just warms your heart.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, there are two main characters and also a big supporting characters cast. The first main character, she is voiced by Mimori Suzuko and Ballard Tia, is Nanami Momozono. She is a teenage girl, who is having quite a difficult life. She has quite an average academic progress and boys do not think that she is cute. She would love to fix her school problems and spare more time for the girls\u2019 stuff, but she cannot do that, since her father is a big gambler, who always causes her daughter a ton of problems. Too bad, but her misfortune only continues: she is evicted from her apartment, because of her father\u2019s debts. Thankfully, a young man listens to Nanami\u2019s problems and offers her to live at his place, which he abandoned 20 years ago. In addition to this, he also kisses her on the forehead to express his gratitude. After some time, it turns out that Nanami is invited to live in a God\u2019s shrine and that the young man that kissed her passed her the mark of the area\u2019s deity, which changed her life a lot. The second main character is Tomoe, who is voiced by Tachibana Shinnosuke and Tatum John Michael. Tomoe is a fox yokai, who serves as the familiar of the land God Mikage. However, one day, Mikage leaves his shrine, leaving Tomoe alone. After 20 years, Mikage makes Nanami the new mistress of the shrine, and so it makes Tomoe her familiar now. At first, the fox youkai does not appreciate the fact that he now has a new master, who is just a schoolgirl and, of course, a human. However, because of something, he changes his opinion about Nanami and starts to care about her. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, both main characters receive good character development. Though, you will only find out more about Tomoe in the second season; it is not that important. I guess you will surely appreciate the fact that both main characters change as the anime progresses. You will also like the fact that there is a huge supporting characters cast, which will not make you feel bored. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to know my personal opinion on this anime, I would say that it is one of the best romance anime I have ever seen in my life. I am not a fan of that genre, and \u2018 shoujo\u2019 is definitely not my favorite genre. However, Kamikiss, somehow, won my interest. It manages to keep you interested, because it has a very misleading first episode, which will surely form a very wrong opinion on this anime. However, the more you watch it, the more you understand that this anime is not that simple. It tries to make you feel secure, but then it says \u2018hey, you cannot feel relaxed yet, we have plenty of ways to make you worry about the characters.\u2019\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I cannot say that Kamisama Kiss is an absolute masterpiece. However, as a romance it did manage to keep me interested. I would not recommend this anime for someone, who does not like romance; just avoid this anime if you are not a fan of the genre. However, if you are a big sucker for a good romance anime, then you should definitively give this show a try; it will not disappoint you.",

Thanks for being patient and also  for following my reviews this year..there will be more to come in 2018. Let\u2019s get to it!\r\nStory: I enjoyed the storytelling! Each episode had a different focus while still sticking to the main plot. This was a very fun show to watch.\r\nArt: The artwork was beautiful, very  clean and easy on the eyes. I loved the choice of colors and the use of cherry blossoms...what a vision.\r\nSound: I love Dubs from  Funimation becausethe cast does an AH-MAZING job with the characters. I give it a 10/10. The music was enchanting and each opening and ending theme was catchy and they\u2019re in  my playlist (previously mentioned in my reviews and will be listed in my profile). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The relationships were nice, but the  ambiguity of the relationship status of the two man characters bothers me  and that\u2019s why I plan to read the manga. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I am definitely going to rewatch this show in a few months, this is just SUCH a cute anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I highly recommend this as a cute short show for those who love comedy, romance and English dubs done by Funimation.\\n\\n\r\nThank you so much for your patience, your support and your overall awesomeness. Please continue to rock with me in the upcoming year. Happy New Year and I\u2019ll see you next time.\\n",

A stubborn, clumsy but caring girl becomes a Land God. Helping her with her deities is a handsome, kind of irritated and loyal Tomoe-a demon fox. With a bunch of secondary characters, who are unique, the plot becomes very appealing. I can say that comedy takes over romance in this one. The very first episode showed me that i would have a good time watching the anime with all its laughable moments. Aside from comedy, the anime has a strong main character,which doesn't lead to boredom. The visuals are good, the voice acting and music fit perfectly and I can say that overall this anime is a short, but good journey, filled with laughter and emotion.",

I'm a huge fan of the manga, but the anime ended so early missing a whole plot line. *sigh* I might have been expecting too much, but it is one of my favorite manga of all time. The story is just overall lighthearted and romantic I adore this story line so much. The opening and closing song are both enjoyable. I usually am one to get annoyed with some opening songs but with Kamisama Hajimemashita's opening theme song I found myself listening to it afterI finished the anime.",

            "content": "My friend introduced me to this anime, and to be honest, after listening to the opening song I thought that this anime would be really cheesy. I'm usually very picky about what I see and read, meaning I drop anime/manga rather quickly and easily. Two days later I was done with the anime. A day later I started reading the manga and finished within a week. Yup, I was shamelessly addicted. \r\nThe story (9/10):\r\nI believe the story is original. Of course it has its archetypes and cliches but it isn't like any other anime that I've seen. Furthermore, there aren't many plot holes (at leastI couldn't find one)...rather, it's the complete opposite! Anyone who has read the manga would agree with me that the story is really well planned out. I'm looking forward to what will happen. I'm pretty excited because I can trust that the writer will do a good job. \\n\\n\r\nThe art (10/10):\\n\r\nThis is one of the rare anime that has art that beautifully preserved the style of the manga's. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound (9/10):\\n\r\nDat Tomoe's Soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters (9/10):\\n\r\nI absolutely adore all the characters of this anime. Nanami, the protagonist, isn't some weakling who relies on handsome men to do all her work. No, no, Nanami knows how to stand up for herself, voices her opinion, and isn't afraid of being different. I also like how Tomoe and Mizuki develop throughout the anime. As the anime progresses (and will continue to do so in Season 3) little bits of their pasts are revealed, but at the same time their mystery, which is what keeps them interesting, is kept. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nThis anime is a drug. It's one of those anime that takes you on a violent emotional rollercoaster ride, makes you feel all the feels, and then leaves you with this massive hole in your heart when it's over. There isn't a single boring moment in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10):\\n\r\nIn my opinion, this anime would mostly interest girls (not trying to be sexist. Just sayin'). Anyone looking for gory, complete action-packed anime probably wouldn't enjoy this. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this anime and strongly encourage others to give it a shot. Watch at least the first 3 episodes!",

            "content": "SPOILER ALERT!!! (just in case)\r\nSTORY (10/10): Let me just say first that I read all but the last two volumes of Kamisama Kiss before I watched the anime (sadly, the last two aren't out in America yet). I was really hoping that the anime wouldn't stray from the manga too much and I wasn't disappointed. There were a couple of things that changed -- that ending, though -- but I didn't necessarily find them to be bad changes. They didn't detract from the overall story, so they were just fine in my book. \r\nART (8/10): The art style in this was nothing new, but itwas still beautiful. The colors were great especially. I'd say the only thing I didn't really like about it was the bubbly/hazy/rainbow backgrounds they had sometimes, but they really didn't come as a surprise, considering the type of anime this is. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8/10): The OP on this was kind of catchy. I don't think I ever skipped it. The ending theme was pretty good as well. And let's just take a moment to appreciate the fact that Kurama has his own freaking theme song. I found that especially amusing. The voice acting was enjoyable, although after watching the first episode in dub, I switched to sub and stayed there. I respect Tia Ballard and she's a phenomenal voice actress, but I couldn't watch Nanami talk with the voice of Happy from Fairy Tail. I especially noticed it when she was yelling. It really pulled me out of the anime, so I decided that switching was best. This was just one of those anime that felt like it lost something in translation. The Japanese voice actors did an amazing job on this one.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (10/10): The characters in this anime are great. While there isn't a lot of development, the characters are noticeably changed by the end of the season. I found myself anxiously wondering what was going to happen next (even though I already knew what was going to happen) and how each character was going to react to certain events. I absolutely love the fact that Nanami didn't become this overpowered god, but her powers were instead very limited. Even so, she wasn't this totally useless and helpless character. She could actually fend for herself if need be, even if it was just long enough for Tomoe to get there to save the day. Tomoe himself was just as mysterious, arrogant, brooding, and angry as I'd hoped he would be. His dark past was only hinted at, so I'm curious to see how it's handled as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (10/10): I loved this anime. It stayed true to the manga, it presented the characters perfectly, and it didn't add in any pointless filler. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (9/10): Averaged out, Kamisama Kiss gets a score of 9. An extremely enjoyable anime in my opinion. I can't wait to see the rest of this!",

            "content": "Kamisama Hajimemashita or Kamisama Kiss was made over a decade ago, but that\u2019s not enough to compensate for how cliche and typical it was. There have been several shows that feature a headstrong lead woman who believes if she tries to do her best, she can do anything; and in effect, other characters find themselves drawn to her. I guess the plot line was somewhat different - I mean, it\u2019s not everyday that an ordinary high schooler is chosen to become a god out of whim. However, for something released after the likes of Kachou wa Maid-sama and Special A, it was just okay. \r\nAppealfor the series probably comes from the so-called forbidden master-servant affair; supernatural taboo making it all the more sweet. It could have been more enticing if the romance were less forced and the two actually had chemistry. What\u2019s more is that the presumed charisma from the main character caused an unnecessary, nonsensical reverse harem. Many things that are unexplained are either attributed to the magic/other worldly powers or left up in the air.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end, the anime can be described as, well, cute. Adorable, sure. Good, though, I\u2019m not so certain.",

            "content": "Before I start this review I must say that I quite like this anime even though it doesn't seem like anything special. My suggestion for this series is that if it interests you even a little watch the first few episodes and if you don't like the characters, go ahead and drop the series.\r\nStory(6): \r\nThere really is nothing in the way of an overall plot. This is to be expected as it is only 13 episodes. The anime is just an average shojo, romance, comedy type show. This does not make the show bad, as it is still enjoyable watching the lives of the characters.\r\nCharacters(6):\\n\r\nI found the characters in this series to be enjoyable(I must also admit that I have a soft spot for characters such as Nanami). However, weather you like the characters or not depends on what your looking for in a character. \\n\\n\r\nArt(6): \\n\r\nThe art serves its purpose in telling the story, it it's pleasing to look at just not something you would look at and say, \"What a masterpiece of artwork!\" (if you know what I mean)\\n\\n\r\nSound(7): \\n\r\nThere's nothing much to say about the music, except that the songs were cute and fit the overall tone of the anime quite well. They were also fun to listen to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to those looking for:  \\n\r\n-A short anime(though it does have a 2nd season if you liked the 1st season)\\n\r\n-Some romantic comedy  \\n\r\n-Shoujo \\n\r\n-A little bit of supernatural elements \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Sometimes it's similar to some anime I have named before. This anime is unexpected about reactions or action scenes. The main character is Momozono, Nanami; and the other main character is Tomoe -a guardian of a sanctuary, called 'family'-. The plot is simple but very entertaining, I had fun watching this anime. -It's normal when the genre is romantic comedy-. The serie is about a deity (Nanami-chan) and her family (Tomoe) -as I said before-. \r\nI reallyliked the animation of this anime, so detailed and lively expressions. The anime is so colorful, It has a lot of colours all the time -clothes, body, hair, landscape, etc...- \\n\r\nThe personality of Nanami-chan is so confused about all, she thinks it's useless all time, because Tomoe is always helping her. She has a lot of self-esteem and she is to easy to motivate. Although she wants to help in everything she can.\\n\r\nThe personality of Tomoe is so particular, because he is so introvert, impolite, unkind, but sometimes with Nanami it's just the opposite, he is friendly, worried about her 24/7, modest, responsable, etc... \\n\r\nThe relationship between them is so strange, sometimes both are thinking about 'x is asshole', but sometimes they are so kind and funny. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for read it.",

            "content": "What a charming anime!! Nanami is a high school girl that gets kicked out of her house because her father left her in debt. When she meets a stranger who says she can take his place at her house, she finds herself lead to a shrine. Inhabited by two helpful shrine spirits and Tomoe, the fox spirit who becomes her familiar and thus caretaker/servant, Nanami realises that she has to now become the Land God of that shrine. This involves tasks such as cleaning, performing rituals and matchmaking. Vibrant and hilarious, this anime does a great job at weaving in a few somber aspects intothe overall fun nature of this feature, creating something truly magical!\\n\\n\r\nSo I\u2019ll start of with Tomoe and Nanami\u2019s relationship because that plays a big part in the whole anime. Initially, Tomoe feels betrayed that Nanami is taking the place of his old master and is quite cold towards her. When he sees what a swell personality she has, he actually warms up to her at quite a rapid pace, but it surprisingly doesn\u2019t feel unnatural. I think we can put that up to the fact that we are always left wondering whether the kindness Tomoe shows Nanami is because he is obliged to serve her as her familiar, or whether there is something more brewing. A lot of the scenes had the potential to show him as an overbearing and self-torturing guy, yet it managed to dodge that and always pulled it off with him acting sweet as sugar.\\n\\n\r\nNanami as a protagonist is really likeable because she is quite selfless, yet she does go out of her way to preserve her relationship with Tomoe. Her heartwarming nature earns her many friends in this anime including a bunch of awesome and varied side characters:\\n\\n\r\nWe have Mizuki, a familiar that can turn himself into a snake. A very cute snake though! After being saved by Nanami, he develops this strong admiration for her and tries to pull her attention away from Tomoe to focus it towards him. When he realises that\u2019s not going to happen, he stays close to her and helps her out, accepting defeat graciously. He was actually one of my favourite characters because you really feel for his loneliness and his desire to have a place to belong and to have someone strongly devoted to him. He is also hilarious when he sparks jealousy within Tomoe and manages to break his steely exterior.\\n\\n\r\nKurama is another spirit who initially had the goal of taking Nanami\u2019s place as a God, yet later grew into a helpful friend when Nanami and Tomoe were in a pickle\u2026one which involved Tomoe turning into a toddler: \\n\\n\r\nAs he is a famous pop-idol, this strange background music plays whenever he enters the scene, which felt kind of ridiculous, but hey, it at least had comedic appeal. Speaking of comedic appeal, this show has many instances of hilarious moments, including one in which Tomoe takes the place of Nanami and is there to witness Kurama\u2019s brash flirting. Fun times ensue. Oh and did I forget the time when Kurama got turned into an ostrich and got chased around the school by Tomoe? Their combined scenes are quite entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nAnother character of interest include, Mikage, the God that left the shrine to Nanami in the first place. Throughout the anime, we begin to unravel that he may have done this to resolve some issues of Tomoe\u2019s past and this leads us to question Nanami\u2019s link to Tomoe\u2019s past. For this reason, I\u2019m getting the same kind of vibes for this anime as both Inuyasha, for the twisted reincarnation relationships and similar dog/fox based characters. Also Noragami, due to the elements of shrines, Gods and characters having potentially dark pasts.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the art style and the character design, especially of Nanami. The hair curling around her face and always rosy cheeks seems unique and really fits with her character. The soundtrack is also something that really sucked me in. The opening song really fits the whole lightly rebellious and carefree nature that is predominantly present during this anime and even the ending song has the sweet nature that suits Nanami\u2019s character\\n\\n\r\nSo the plot basically revolves around Nanami\u2019s developing relationship with both Tomoe and her powers as a God. Nanami\u2019s kindness is saccharine sweet as she goes about matchmaking for her friends and dealing out sympathy for her kidnappers and those that wish to do her harm. Her desire to make others happy and take care of the shrine prevails over the dark discoveries that weave a backstory about Tomoe\u2019s past. Overall, this is a delightful anime which is really the whole package. Though it focuses so much on the romance, the plot is never brushed under the rug - go watch it and fall in love!",

            "content": "~Story~ 8 \r\nOkay so let me give you the layout. This story is about High schooler Nanami Momozono. This anime begins with her absentee father being in such extreme debt that they lose everything, and she gets kicked out from her home. Downtrodden and homeless, she runs into a man being harassed by a dog. After helping him, she explains her situation, and to her surprise, he offers her his home in gratitude. But when she discovers that said home is a rundown shrine, she tries to leave; however, she is caught by two shrine spirits and a fox familiar named Tomoe. They mistake herfor the man Nanami rescued\u2014the land god of the shrine, Mikage. Realizing that Mikage must have sent her there as a replacement god, Tomoe leaves abruptly, refusing to serve a human. Rather than going back to being homeless, Nanami immerses herself in her divine duties. But if she must keep things running smoothly, she will need the help of a certain hot-headed fox. In her fumbling attempt to seek out Tomoe, she lands in trouble and ends up sealing a contract with him. After that their relationship grows stronger as the anime progresses, and miss nanami touches the heart of every person she meets. \\n\r\n~Art~ 8 \\n\r\nThe artwork was so beautiful, all the males looked so handsome and the girls looked so pretty that I'm almost jealous (little hard to be jealous when they are not real people, but that\u2019s besides the point). You could always tell what the characters were feeling by their faces and let me tell you some scenes where hilarious and their faces made it all the better. \\n\r\n~Sound~  7 \\n\r\nOpening song: 6 \\n\r\nI think that the opening song is a little strange but its upbeat and kinda catchy in a way that really doesn\u2019t make sense. \\n\r\nEnding song: 7  \\n\r\nThe ending song is short but extremely catchy for some reason, I could help but sing it whenever I heard it. \\n\r\nVoice acting:8 \\n\r\nI like how everyone fits their respective characters, and they in turn all sound good together. \\n\r\n~Character~ 8 \\n\r\nAll the character are entertaining and they are well portrayed by their voice actors. Nanami is sweet and caring but when it comes to our favorite hot headed fox tomoe she can get a little less sweet when he is being rude. Speaking of Tomoe he is usually rude to everyone but he has a special spot for his current mistress, Nanami, and past master, mikage.  \\n\r\n~enjoyment~ 9 \\n\r\nOkay that is exceedingly high from how I would normally put it but I thought this anime was just so adorable and sorta romantic and well I just couldn\u2019t help but love it. ( although it could have had to do with J. Michael Tatum's voice acting) Anyways I really enjoyed this anime, I thought it was adorable. \\n\r\n~overall~ 8 \\n\r\nI recommend this anime to everyone. It is a sweet dose of romance and excitement, plus it has the magical aspect covered. If gods, familiars, and battles of love and other forces are your thing then this is your anime.",

The characters were nicely done, and it was nice to see their personalities come through their appearance. AND DAMN, TOMOE IS A FINE PIECE OF EYE CANDY. I also felt that the voice actors were chosen well.^^\r\nI do have a few complaints though. Thestory was very very rushed. If you guys have read the manga, you would understand what I mean. Tomoe's and Nanami's relationship grew at an unrealistically fast rate in this anime, but none the less, it was still enjoyable to watch.

She finds out later that his house is a shrine and she's the new God of that shrine. She meets the two shrine spirits and then seals a contract with the familiar. So what else a normal girl should do after becoming a God? watch and you'll see. \r\nThe romance is the first reason why I fell in love with this series, and it's also what made me want to wait for the secondseason, and watch the two OVAs too!\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9)\\n\r\nI think the drawing was really great and well done! The colors were really comforting for the eyes. neither too dark nor too bright. the movement of the characters and the backgrounds were also beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (9)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and actors voices were just amazing! Especially the closing song. a a a a~ a a a a~ it's so catchy! I even caught myself listening to it many times. it's so beautiful and enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (10)\\n\r\nMaybe here I'm being so different than everyone. I know many people disliked the characters. But to me, the characters were well written and developed. From the perspective of a person who's into astrology, I'd say, they were so realistically made. Especially for the familiar \"Tomoe\", keeping how did his character change from how he was in the past is why everyone is so excited to watch the next season. His character was very mysterious and cool and funny! The main character \"Nanami\" I loved how you can listen to all her thoughts and understand the way she felt and developed feelings and ideas.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10)\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime so much. I enjoyed the story and the characters, both were very well done and it made me want more and more of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: (10)\\n\r\nI really loved the whole thing so much. I have so many feelings and I felt involved in the story to the point where I fell in love with whatever \"Nanami\" fell in love with. Very exciting and funny. A great why to spend time. I think an anime is good if it made me get attached to the characters, and this is exactly what's going on. \\n\\n\\n",

The personalities of all the characters really shine through and you can almost feel the connection between various characters. It finished on a happier note which is not often usual for animes like this! (I won't say too much) It also shows not to judge a book by it's cover, people can me more powerful and braver than first assumed.\r\n I would definitely recommend this anime, especially if you enjoyed Fruits Basket, this is similar in a few ways,but there is a bit more action rather than comedy, but there are still some funny and enjoyable parts, I also thought it would've been better with a little bit more romance between the two main characters other than just a small part, like the usual clich\u00e9 where pretty much all the romance is in the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's a great anime! 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy!",

Also the cover wasn't very appealing but I decided to watch it because I had nothing better to do. So I gave it a chance. I LOVED IT! n__n Honestly if you love comedy with a bit of comedy and romance this anime is for you. It wasa perfect balance for me and who knows, perhaps its same for you.\\n\\n\r\nDon't make my same mistake and give it a chance. What could you lose? like 25 min? :p",

            "content": "I never expected to rate this anime this high. This is by far the cutest shojou reverse harem comedy romance that has recently charmed me. To cut to the chase, if you're into romance with a hilarious sense of humor you NEED to watch this show. Actually, I think everyone who's into reverse harems should watch this series. This one's a gem!\r\nWhat I like about this show is that every episode makes your heart flutter (no kidding). The show is really lighthearted, the amount of teasing just equals out to the amount of butterfly in your tummy moments. The humor is also on point hilariousaf each episode. There are times that you couldn't stop laughing most esp when this character Kurama enters the scene with his bg nightcore music playing. I choke on my food everytime I hear it. Too funny to handle. Plot is a little unique in its own way, its not too heavy on the drama which is good.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I really liked about this show was the main heroine, Nanami. She is just divine. You can see great character developments on her part. She's really feisty and definitely not the annoying reverse harem useless Mary Sue kind. In fact majority of her scenes shows her failures and flaws. Kinda gives you a reality check that not everyone's perfect. But ordinary as she may seem, her determination to do better (despite failing over and over) and her self acceptance of being weak is what makes her different from other heroines. She's not needy either. Plus points since her seiyu is Mimori Suzuko - best girl! <3\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme had the perfect upbeat cute tune for the anime. The character themed music are on point too. As I mentioned, Kurama's nightcore is too perfect for words. lmao\\n\\n\r\nI guess my only dissapointment lies on the fact that the series skipped a lot of important stuff on the manga but I guess that's fine since the show can stand on its own without making any kind of references on the manga its based from. Also, season 2 ended too soon and a lot of fans were disappointed that the animators decided to stop the series altogether. So they introduced new characters and mercilessly ended the season with a cliffhanger. SOB WHY THEY DO THIS TO US ALL THE TIME?!\\n\\n",

            "content": "**NO SPOLIERS** \r\nThe best word I have to describe Kamisama Hajimemashita is ridiculous. It is extremely comical, heartwarming, unrealistic, and a joy to watch. That being said I really love shojo, supernatural/ayakashi, and romance anime and if you don't like any of those things this probably isn't the best show for you and the few low ratings it's been given I'm sure are coming from people who may want something more realistic/slice of life-esque which this anime is absolutely not. I have read what is released of the manga and watched the anime completely (OVAs included) and it is one of my all-time favorites.\r\nOverall thisanime is a 10/10 and I gladly rewatch some of my favorite episodes when I need a pick me up. \\n\\n\r\nNow to reviewing the elements...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I gave this an 8/10 was because it sticks true to the manga for the most part, there are definitely elements that couldn't fit into an anime adaptation (especially for the first season) and there were a couple aspects that were rushed in terms of following the manga. However, the general story follows the manga. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI think the animation was really beautiful and used to enhance the story and characters as depicted in the manga making an anime adaptation success in my book. The character design was completely true to the manga and the use of bright colors throughout the anime really brought the whimsical nature of the manga to the screen very well. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nTHE SOUND REALLY WAS THE SELLING POINT FOR ME ON THE ANIME. I am a sucker for good sound design and Kamisama Hajimemashita hit it out of the park in this aspect. The music used in the scenes are modern interpretations of traditional music and traditional instruments which fit the nature of the anime very well seeing as a major part of the story is bringing traditional elements of living in a shrine to \"everyday\" life. The opening is cute and fits well, the song choice definitely isn't one of my favorite openings, but sound isn't all about openings and closings. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters are hilarious, very individual in their personalities which make for hilarious interactions-- just as it is in the manga. The development is slightly rushed in the beginning, however not unusual for a season of 12 episodes. I love Nanami's character because she is realistic as a high school girl despite not being a normal high schooler whatsoever-- When Kurama is introduced the fangirl aspect made her character more relatable as a high schooler. Tomoe's character is so opposite of Nanami-- responsible and decisive that again it provides for hilarious interactions between them. The rest of the characters I love and I felt somewhat attached to them as I continued watching. The characters themselves are 10/10 but the slightly rushed development is what made me knock it down to a 9/10.",

They came out with a second season so I re-watched the first season and I still love it. \r\nStory:\r\nA girl loses her home and is given (not 100% willingly) a new home. Now some of you are going to say \"how was it unwilling?\" well that's because the house has an ownership, like a car except this one is given and cannot be returned easily, especially when the previous owner disappears. Anyways it is a comedy, action, and a love story. I am female so that is my perfect combination. \r\nArt:\r\nSoft colours and many subtle things that givethe anime that \"ooh\" factor. From little blue butterflies to a cloudless night full of stars. Pretty straightforward but it still makes me smile at the sense of calmness the anime portrays.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI love the theme song. Not much in the way of sound throughout the anime but I also feel it was well thought out. There was a narrator in the beginning which I think they did better then if it was a memory because it only explained the pertinent details and not all the other crap that goes along with flashbacks. Wait does this statement belong with sound? \\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThroughout the whole anime the main characters are growing and becoming stronger both in body and mind it is fascinating to see and relish in when they finally understand something and are able to make the proper amendments to their own mistakes and become perfection.\\n\r\nI love all the characters even the ones I probably shouldn't have liked ;)\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI LOVE LOVE L-O-V-E this anime, one of my favorites.

The anime is mainly about a young girl whose house goes into foreclosure due to her fathers debt. She is obviously devastated and is left out on a bench not sure what to do when a strange voice calling for help followed by barks call her attention. She rescues the strange screaming man stuck in the tree from the dog simply by showing it love and in such great thanks this strange yet charismatic man gives her his home! She doesn't want to be ungratefulfor she has no where to go anyways and takes the man up on his offer. When she arrives at her new home it's simply a rotten old shrine with a gloomy aura, but that isn't the only surprise. There are creepy voices and a strangely attractive yet freaky fox demon to greet her. And that's how the first episode begins. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime is hilarious and brought me a ton of joy. I would suggest reading the manga because the story line and art really come into the play and it's beautiful and my favorite manga as well. Tomoe is the main male character and I gotta say he's your classic cold hearted good looking guy who has a soft spot for that one special girl. Nanami is the main female character and she is light hearted, giving, and has a beautiful personality for a 2d anime characte. All the funny and lovably characters really makes the anime a favorite. I strongly suggest you give this anime a chance as well as the manga I believe you will truly enjoy the art. This is also the most different romantic comedy I've ever watched, it's different and will simply bring you joy.",

XD\r\nI just really wanna make a review about my most favorite anime this season!!!\r\nI didn't know about this until I read something about Kamisama Hajimemashita being good. XD\r\nI didn't read the manga, didn't hear about this before, BUT, when I watched the first episode, OMG, so many things happened and I was immediately attracted to this anime! X3\r\nIt doesn't matter if you haven't read the manga yet. Once you watch this series, it'll make you read the manga and you won't be satisfied with 13 episodes. That is happening to me right now. XD\r\nSOOO... WATCH IT! IT'S SOOO GOOD!XD",

But the thing is: even I LOVING the manga, I really have some problems watching the anime. Yeah, it's loyal, but I think that could be much better than was. \r\nApart from this, the anime is PRETTY GOOD. It's cute, have some awesome characters and the admissible songs. Ok, being honest, the ending isn't it all, but it's nice, and the opening is okay enough. \r\nThe anime was short, so I think they had to do things short. If you don't read the manga, you'll beokay with that, 'cause the end was cute, lovely and all the thing  we dreamed in our favorites animes. But for me... I don't know, I just feel like if they they were to do a second season, so the first couldn't have that kind of end. All was fluffy (like Tomoe's ears, hehe) and all, but this bothered me.\\n\\n\r\nOk, talking about Tomoe, I've to say: I just love the most part of the characters. Nanami, the main, is smart, kind and persistent, and it makes me really like her. Tomoe is the guy I want for me, and I can say that he have my heart now. Being rough, and sometimes being so sweet... Mizuki, Mikage, Kurama, these were others that I liked. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I can say  I really like the anime. It's nice see a manga creating life. And, no matter what I said, I hope that have a second season. \\n\\n\r\nPS: People, my English isn't very good, but I tried. I just felt I had to express myself about this anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "A truly mesmerizing anime series that you will not get enough of. Romantic comedy to say the least, because what holds the show together is its dark foundation. \r\nStoryline has an incredible buildup with plenty of background to support the characters and their actions. Not only this, but it gives the audience twists and turns that are definitely unexpected from such a romantic and comedic show. The story is so well put together that you'll feel like you're experiencing everything on a personal level. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll want more 10/10\r\nart in one word PERFECT. Beautiful colors and outstanding animation. Beautiful down tothe smallest of scenes, just beautiful. In fact, the smallest scenes are the best. You have to watch it to understand the beauty of it. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNot crazy about the opening song, BUT the closing song is totally catchy and something about it is dark, which leads back to its storyline foundation. The composition of music within the episodes is just so beautiful- it truly reflects romance. The music in this series only adds to the art and is something to look forward to as much as the next episode. Ah a-a ah (you'll know once you listen to the closing song) 10/10\\n\\n\r\nObsessed with each and every character, down to Kotetsu. All characters have such a deep background to them that you grow attached in one way or another. Character growth and development may seem slow at first, but that exactly why i loved it. They posses real emotional qualities that are developed superbly, and just like real emotions and feelings. The characters are stubborn, cold, hopeful, arrogant, romantic, hopeless, & broken. PS- in love with Tomoe 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Kamisama Hajimemashita unlike any other. It holds the number 1 rank on my list no doubt. If you have doubts about it i suggest you watch it regardless, because thats exactly what i did. I skipped this anime so many times, i cant even believe it. \\n\\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and give it a chance, especially if youre a girl. \\n\\n",

Then begins her new exciting life as a goddess. The animation is pretty good, fluid movements and lively backgrounds. The characters are very likeable and well-written. My favorite is Mizuki, his playing of the flute, by example, in the last two episodes is simply hilarious. The story develops itself well. What I don't like, is that there are too little episodes in my opinion. The character development is mostly successful, but Tomoe's change and the conclusion of the story seema bit rushed. I think, that is because of the shortness of the anime. Overall a very good show and definitively worth watching. One of my all time favorites. As for the soundtrack, the opening and ending are very good ( one of the few I don't skip after the first episodes ) and the BGM are also good. The VA did a good job.",

The art was also very good and I liked most of the characters. They had a lot of depth in them and a lot hidden butalso very sweet and all unique. This anime was very unique and i loved it a lot!!! The music also, let me point out, Is so amazing:) its really cute without being annoying. I don't usually watch the op and endings, but once i heard the first few seconds, i kept listening through the whole thing even though i wanted to skip it. I really enjoyed it... It was funny, serious, a beautiful story, well thought out and just amazing in general! \\n\r\nA must recommend for all!!!! \\n\\n\r\n****Oh and also the OVAS aren't OVAs they are actually part of the story line and you could say a third season... If you want to know the whole story, you must watch all the OVAs (the one with 4 episodes come first) so yeah thats it:) Se ya around",

It's really funny, without being  the humour being forced.\r\nAnother thing that should definetely be mentioned, is that the story is unique.\r\nRather than following the typical romantic flow every shoujo anime has, it leaves the romance lying behind the story without interrupting it, and making it expected and boring. On the contrary, there are some unexpected and exciting scenes that make your heart flutter.\r\nThe characters are undoubtedly funny and interesting in their own special way, and they're rather handsome- I guessthat's important for the girls who want to watch it ;P\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite good, without exaggerations, and the music helps you get into the mood.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, my advice is : MUST WATCH <3",

The opening song lyrics are the pinnacle of this.\r\n2) The only other one I can think of is that the plot is typical of Slice of Life animes, so it doesn't really progress to any set goal. However, it's only 13 episodes long per season, so it's not bad.\r\nPros:\r\n1) It's definitely funny, and I did laugh out loud at moments.\r\n2) I like the character development that goes on in the supporting characters.\r\nOverall:\r\nWatch it if you have plenty of time and are bored. If you like shojo andromance, then watch it as well. If not, then you're better off finding something a little more meaningful.",

The plot is then based around how she deals with these new duties and her familiar Tomoe. \r\nThe anime has parts which will make you have tears and some parts are humorous. Additionally, the art style is beautiful and each character is so different to each other.\r\nIf you cant tell I definitely would recommend this anime to anyone wholike comedy animes with a bit of romance included. :-)\\n",

When carried over to an anime I found it dull at times and slow moving at others. I had to watch it in between other anime, and could not sit through more than three episodes at a time.\r\nThe art does not disappoint. It's the cutesy style and light palette that you know and love from Shojo anime series, and doesn't lack inthe detail department.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the intros and openings go I found them very fitting and overall adorable. I could actually sit through them at the start and end of the episodes without being thoroughly sick of them by the end of the series. A+ for that. \\n\\n\r\nIf you read the manga the characters are sure to not disappoint, though without having read it first you might find them a bit flat and cliche. \"Young school  girl falls in love with semi-out of reach male.\" sums it up pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nI find no re-watch value in this series, however. It was definitely worth watching, even though it was dull at times. I would recommend it for a rainy day when you need something light and cheery to pick you up.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Now that the English dubbed version of this anime is soon to come out, I should probably write a review of it.  That said, this review is of the _subtitled version_ of this anime.\r\nI hope anyone reading this will at least try this anime - it's a delight and one of the few shows that I watch over and over again.  There is no single part of it that I don't treasure - and not a single character I don't like.  It's wonderful!\r\nThe story is probably the part I like the most.  It's got a credible and sympathetic female lead thatfinds herself without a home or income.  She's quite ordinary except for her incredible fearlessness and her ability to remain positive despite a very difficult childhood.  The tale of how she meets and falls in love with the male lead; a brusque, snarky fox yokai that works as a 'familiar' for the local land god, is precious.  \\n\\n\r\nYou can read the summary of the story for yourself, but it can't express the charm and chemistry of the two main characters' relationship.  Tomoe is most decidedly 'fox-like' in his aloofness and snark, but Nanami's bright personality gets to him anyway.  Nanami, who, it seems, has never been able to rely on anyone, falls for Tomoe's strength and incongruous-seeming concern for her despite his repeated assertion that yokai and humans can't fall in love with one another.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters grow and mature even over the short span of 13 episodes and you end up cheering for them. Side characters are charming, well crafted and add to the story perfectly.  The anime is beautifully drawn with the perfect style to suit the story, a lovely pallet that's just a little misty at the edges - not too artsy, ethereal or saccharine but sweet and grounded.  The musical score is bright and charming and suits the story too; nothing that memorable - it just blends into the mood overall - which is probably the best thing it could do!\\n\\n\r\nI like the pacing - it doesn't have any slow spots, keeps the viewer engaged and following the story without having too many redundancies or making assumptions that the viewer will understand something that a foreign viewer might not.  I really appreciate that!  It translates very well to an American audience, or at least everyone I've ever shown it to has felt so, and I am so pleased to see it coming out dubbed. \\n\\n\r\nAfter all these positives, I tried to think of some negatives, but nothing immediately comes to mind.  It\u2019s too short \u2013 IMHO \u2013 and there\u2019s lots more interesting stuff past the thirteen episodes and one OVA in the manga if they ever wanted to do a season 2, but that\u2019s really all the criticism I could think of for this program.  It\u2019s lovely and one of my few \u2018MUST SEE\u2019 animes.  \\n",

            "content": "This anime is such a breath of fresh air! It's one of my top animes. I'll say right away that you won't enjoy this if you're more into the steamy, ecchi or hentai romances. This anime is sweet and funny and I loved it.\r\nThis anime is flawlessly executed; it has beautiful artwork, a funny but meaningful storyline, interesting and lovable characters, and a sweet and believable romance. It's not the first anime to examine the relationship between humans and youkai, but in my opinion it's one of the best. \r\nStory: 10\r\nThe beginning was kind of crazy, but once I got through it, the story flowedreally well. This is not your typical high school romance, although there are hints of it. The focus here is on Nanami and Tomoe, two drastically different people from different worlds, and how they clash. The story was funny (I actually cried laughing at some parts) but there are serious and touching moments to it as well. I thought the pacing was just right - the two main characters have to learn to love each other, and I thought that was great. The spiritual elements to the story weren't overwhelming either - they were nice touches to a great romance.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nMy biggest pet peeve in animes is ridiculous artwork, and I'm happy to say I didn't find that in this anime. I thought both the character artwork and the background artwork were nicely balanced, and the characters were all so beautiful! Especially Tomoe - I think I fell in love with him, like, the first time I saw him! Absolutely exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe opening theme is so catchy! I found myself singing along, even though I don't speak a word of Japanese lol. The music throughout the show was well suited to different situations, and I found the music even added to the magic of key scenes. The ending theme wasn't as great, but I usually don't like ending themes anyways.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEvery character in this anime worked well with each other. The dynamics in the relationships in this anime were hilarious and perfect. I loved every character, and they were so unique and real it blew my mind. The main characters - Nanami and Tomoe - are perfect. Not only for each other, but for the anime. Nanami is so cute and determined, and Tomoe balances her out with his dangerous allure and sarcastic (almost cruel) sense of humour. They revolve around each other and in the anime so beautifully it's fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/ overall: 10\\n\r\nI recommend this anime 100%! I enjoyed it so much I even went to go read the manga, which is saying something because I usually don't have the patience to read through mangas. The story is so superb, and Nanami and Tomoe are probably my favourite couple (they're currently battling it out with Sawako and Kazehaya). I haven't rewatched this anime yet, but I probably will. Several times.",

The overall sound and scenery was very well done.\r\nThe story is fun.  There's no main arc besides Nanami becoming a land god, but I liked that.  The episodes were enjoyable and lighter than the manga.  The characters were funny and had their own unique personalities.  I would say that they were very memorable.  I enjoyed the story too, because I could sympathize with Nanami as wellas laugh with her.  Fair warning: the romance is really slow.  It's great and well written, but they don't get together right away, and I liked that a lot too.  The story dealt more with personal character growth and relationship growth rather than romance.  The \"harem\" factor (if you can even call it that) was also well done because the guys were not overwhemingly in love with her and confessing to her.  It was a great anime.\\n\r\nHighly recommend this!",

Not enough to make me laugh or smile, but it kept me entertained and what's more important, kept me watching the show. \r\nThe bad:\r\n- The animation quality as well as art design, although not too important in this kind of anime,have a lot of room for improvement. It didn't distract me from watching the show, but it was pretty noticeable. The style and aesthetic of the series was alright overall but it wouldn't call it \"innovating\", \"good\" or \"well chosen\" or anything like that. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSort of tl; dr?\\n\\n\r\nThe show is mediocre. I wouldn't call it good or bad. It was OK and I'm not regretting spending my time on it, but I feel like there are plenty of shows that would play around the romance theme better in the same 12 episode time frame.

It's funny, somewhat thrilling because some characters are really scary and weird looking, and of course it's romantic. Tomoe and Nanami looks good together. At first, I'm in doubt that, this anime would be good to watch, I mean, there's load of beautiful anime, and you'll probably think that animes-that-are-up-to-no-good are time consuming. I never regretted watching this one! It's a combination of everything. And the OST of Kamisama Kiss is truly amazing, I find myself singing whenever it is played. Watch this guys!",

            "content": "If you're in the mood for something funny, fast paced, with romance and fantasy you'll like this anime.It does remind me of Inuyasha but this anime has an identity of its own for sure.The main girl isn't annoying which was refreshing. There wasn't a second of the show that was wasted on long drawn out scenes. It's very direct and to the point and fun to watch. In a nutshell its about a homeless girl who takes the place of the God of an abandoned shrine. With the help of her familiar Tomoe she works to unit humans and yokai while in the process findingher place where she can call home and finding love in the process. In the manga it digs deeper into Tomoe's past and Nanami traveling back in time (like Inuyasha).\\n\\n\r\n If you want to read the manga the anime follows the story line about 99% and the few things they did change I felt like was a good choice and didn't take away from the story at all. If you want to skip all the crap you already watched I would say start at chapter 25 which starts right after \"the beach\" episode and right before the ending \"festival\" episode the other chapters are basically a mirror image of what you already watched there is maybe one or two chapters that were left out of the anime but you can go back and read the beginning after you catch yourself up on the story if you want to.",

Tomoe is her first familiar ( a being who serves a master by a secret contracted made by the two individuals.) a wolf (I'm guessing) demon.... he served for the shrines long before Nanami takes over. After it's recent master passes the role over to her.  Tomoe seems to havethe common dislike for humans for he thinks there are just weak beings and nothing else.  But soon Nanami starts to fall in love with him, and after a while, he starts to realize he loves her too.........",

            "content": "I can usually judge how i'll feel about an anime from the intro and this one was no different. Overall it was very enjoyable to watch with great characters, music and story. On the downside its another anime that doesn't really end. They just picked a good spot to stop. Regardless its worth a watch. I'd best describe this anime as a mash up of fruits basket and tactics. Like fruits basket this average school girl gets stuck living with a bunch of strange men who all have a theme to them (being diff gods) and meets them one by one. She finds the goodin them each and they all end up adoring her. Like tactics there is a strong central theme that humans and demons can't be together but the human is determined to over come that. The love story is a little unexpected at first but it doesn't get in the way of the overall story, which i liked, but we're also not necessarily left in \"they'll never be together\" land. But like i said it doesn't really end so that's up to you.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-cute, light hearted story (great if you just came off a morbid anime and need to do a 180)\\n\r\n-great characters with strong personalities and developed backstories\\n\r\n-really good music\\n\r\n-nice artwork\\n\r\n-even tho the main character is a typical high school girl with a heartbreaking crush she still has a lot of personality and doesn't just give in to everything around her\\n\\n\r\ncons:\\n\r\n-biggest one is that it doesn't really have an ending (manga still publishing)\\n\r\n-because of the above there are a few plot holes even tho the overall story is good (think how fruits basket had plot holes)\\n\r\n-feels a bit rushed sometimes and the progression of time isn't too clear\\n\r\n-if your a person that finds voice actors important i'd really watch this in japanese. the english is good but funimation is so short on new actors all the characters across anime are starting to sound the same. it really bugged me for tomoe's voice just cuz tatum is starting to be over used.",

            "content": "Kamisama Hajimemashita is a typical Shojou romance/comedy anime.\r\n(8) The story is very interesting, a little exaggerated though. It's not really common seeing mare humans becoming Gods. Another problem would be that, the anime is really short! It only has 13 episodes so, you don't really get to see much of the original story in the manga, only the beginning. There's also a lack of character development due to the shortness of the anime. Otherwise, the story is very funny and not boring at all.\r\n(10) Since it was produced in 2012 I expected the art to be amazing, and I wasn't dissappointed at all whenI started watching this anime. It is also very similar to  Suzuki Julietta's original art in the manga. I really have nothing to complain about, it was amazing. ^^\\n\\n\r\n(9)I guess I'll talk about Nanami and Tomoe, the main characteres.\\n\r\nWell.... because I've also read the manga, I learned more about the characteres.\\n\r\nAnyway, inspite of the missing ch. development, they are built very nicely.\\n\r\nNanami- is the typical powerful shojou heroine. She has a strong heart, is really king and  a little stupid sometimes.\\n\r\nTomoe- the cold  Kitsune (fox demon) at the beginning who becomes more and more softer after being Nanami's familiar. I, personally, fell in love whit this character!\\n\\n\r\n(9)I enjoyed every second! It never got boring, it was funny 'till the and it made want to watch more episodes every time I finished one.I just couldn't stop watching. It took me one day to watch the whole show.\\n\\n\r\n(9) Overall, it was a great anime, one of my favourites. If you enjoy a good comedy, you should watch this. It also quite romantic and cute, but almost never too dramatic.",

I admit I only had decided to watch it because of Tomoe. He was just so hot in all these pictures I've been seeing. Haha.\r\nThe art is very lovely. I approve of that. They have a beautiful opening and ending theme song and music. The only problem I do have is probaly the heroine, Nanami. She seems too much of a ditzy idiot for my taste. I can tolerate her, but sometimes Ithink she is so stupid. And Tomoe! Fangirl scream! He is my highlight! I want more anime episodes just so I can get more of him. He is definitely the hottest guy and I hope Nanami and Tomoe's relationship could develop further.",

If I got anything wrong (like an name, or episode), please tell me and I will correct it. Thank you, and this review will have spoilers, because my spoilers could be different from yours. I will try to only talk about the anime, so if you have seen all of it, you are safe.\r\nI really loved this show, and how it showed itself. I watched it allnight long just watching it, but I was disappoint when I saw that they didn't continue the anime to 25 episodes like normally they do.\\n\\n\r\nStoryline:\\n\r\nI really liked it, but this was nothing really new. Even if, they pulled it off pretty well. The supernatural feel made it even better for me to watch, and it never got old. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAMAZING! Such beautiful art, and it made it even better, it wasn't an eyesore to me like some animes. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nVery well made, they pulled it off very good. Loved it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s):\\n\\n\r\nI really liked them, good characters. \\n\\n\r\n(SPOILER ALERT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE WHOLE ANIME)\\n\r\nJust one thing I really wanted in the show was Nanami get better at learning her skills of being a god, and it never really was focused on. Doesn't mean it wasn't, I will be lying through my teeth, but still could have been better. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nOver the top, I loved it. Amazing show, a show I will totally recommend to my friends. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nGood show, but it isn't the most show in the world. Even if, I will still watch the next season if their is one. \\n\\n\r\n(SPOILERS ABOUT THEIR ROMANCE IS HERE, DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE WHOLE ANIME)\\n\r\nThe romance, is very good, but Tomoe and Nanami's romance was so distant. But I can't complain about it so much because Tomoe was fearful to fall in love with her, so I can't bash the guy so much.\\n\\n",
