            "content": "Conventional wisdom has always taught us that more is usually better. We think that the more expensive car should have more completely unrelated features, the better ice-cream sundae should have a bigger pile of fresh fruit on top, and the better statistics report should be able to pull more numbers out of it\u2019s arse. We compare phones by the multitude of apps it can run, our enjoyment of horror films is based on how many different ways the various victims die, and we often rate anime by how many story arcs, characters, subplots and themes it can cram into it\u2019s 26 episode season. \r\nAs themodern entertainment sector continues to emphasize excess and surplus, Nichijou is a much welcome, and frankly much needed throwback to a more old-school approach to entertainment. Nichijou\u2019s frugal yet distinct style reminds us that something is perfect, not because there\u2019s nothing more to add to it, but because there is nothing more to take away.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou brings to us a fusion of gag, moe, slice-of-life and slapstick comedy. It\u2019s humor is very reminiscent of Azumanga Diaoh while it\u2019s art style borrows heavily from the distinctly colorful palette of Lucky Star. Nichijou adopts a very light-hearted approach with it\u2019s tone; it\u2019s jokes are played fast and loose, and while there is a constant shift of pacing throughout each episode, Nichijou never seems to take itself very seriously. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most noteworthy thing about Nichijou is it\u2019s production value. Frankly speaking, Nichijou is GORGEOUS to look at; it\u2019s animation so incredibly fluid and it\u2019s art so crisp and vivid that it actually puts other supposedly competent studios to shame. The artwork selects it\u2019s palette very sparingly, with a result that is both vibrant yet easy on the eyes. This gentle tone is then frequently punctuated by segments of metaphorical (and in some cases literal) animation explosions, showcasing KyoAni\u2019s talent with a huge variety of styles from gritty realism to crayon slapstick. \\n\\n\r\nOne can\u2019t help but wonder if KyoAni isn\u2019t deliberately showing off their workmanship with this anime. Many originally very short panels from the manga are translated into incredibly imaginative and stunning sequences of animation that simply scream \u201cbecause we can.\u201d Show off or not, Nichijou\u2019s cinematography is nothing short of outstanding; it\u2019s liberal interpretation of the original source material has really allowed the creativity of director Ishihara Tatsuya and the KyoAni animators to shine through like nothing we\u2019ve ever seen before.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial mention to Nichijou\u2019s OP and ED songs, which are creative shorts (incredibly well sync\u2019d I might mention) in their own right. As a fun fact, both of Nichijou\u2019s OPs are sung by Hyadain, who is ONE guy. No female backing vocals at all, he does it all himself. Seriously I\u2019m not joking, go look it up.\\n\\n\r\nThe aforementioned dynamic pacing forms the basis of Nichijou\u2019s entertainment value. Each episode tackles it\u2019s structure with a large degree of unpredictability. You never know what\u2019s going to happen next, be it a humorous dialogue scene, a fast paced action sequence, an amusing random still image or a hilarious but completely unrelated skit. Despite this seemingly chaotic approach, Nichijou still manages to find a good balance between all it\u2019s various styles so that no episode feels too weighted. While such a haphazard approach may seem counter-intuitive for a slice-of-life anime, this style ends up working greatly in Nichijou\u2019s favor, adding another layer to it\u2019s texture of absurdity.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor itself is very simplistic, almost to a fault, and one would normally attribute this as one of Nichijou\u2019s flaws. That is of course until you remember that \u201cNichijou\u201d translates to \u201cMy Ordinary Life\u201d and as such, the simplicity of the jokes are a fitting homage to the show\u2019s title and premise. Many of the jokes are simply exaggerated normal events like missing the train or a waiter forgetting your order, relying on witty dialogue delivery and clever timings to get the humor across. Some may consider this a hit-or-miss sort of comedy, which is only a fair judgement. All the same, you don\u2019t necessarily have to laugh at jokes like these to appreciate them, which is one of the main reasons why slice-of-life can have such a widespread appeal (remember K-On?)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very likable, despite the obvious utilization of moe in many of their design. If you can shed that manly exterior and look past the few excessively \u201ccute\u201d scenes, there\u2019s actually an abundance of things to enjoy about Nichijou\u2019s characters. Conventional archetypes are few and far between in this anime, and all the characters harbor their own quirky habits and flaws that you\u2019ll quickly grow fond of.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about Nichijou\u2019s characters however, isn\u2019t their individuality, but how they interact with each other. The personalities of various character groups clash, contrast and complement each other in extremely interesting ways; the conversations and activities of the two golden trios of Nichijou: Yuuko/Mio/Mai and Hakase/Nano/Sakamoto make up the abundance of material in each episode and just their hilarious adventures by themselves could probably carry an entire show. This is furthered by the great voice acting that the Nichijou provides; Nichijou is one of the rare shows where the seiyuus genuinely sound like they\u2019re enjoying themselves. Dialogues are delivered with copious amounts of enthusiasm which really helps sell the spirited relationships that the various characters enjoy with each other.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that has been said though, I would like to come back to that idea I mentioned when we began, that idiom of \u201cless is more.\u201d The thing I love most about Nichijou, isn\u2019t the amazing artwork, the clever cinematography, the light-hearted humor or even the imaginative characters. What I love most about Nichijou is the fact that, behind all the technicalities and production values, lies a very simple ideal. Everything about Nichijou revolves around this central principle of being enjoyable. All that it does, every scene, every character, every line of dialogue alludes back to this principle. Because at the end of the day, all Nichijou wants you to do is one thing; it wants you to enjoy yourself. With Nichijou, there is no story, no subplots, no recurring themes, no character development, no product placement, no lessons to be learnt, no obscure references to pander to a niche audience, no obvious fan-service pandering or ploys to sell related merchandise. \\n\\n\r\nFun is the only thing that matters, and it's this frugality, this ingenious simplicity, that allows everything to just click together like magic.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you finally get home after a long tiring day, the only thing Nichijou wants to do is to give you an excuse to prop your feet up after and wash that blue feeling away as it slowly puts that grin back onto your face.",

            "content": "If I had to sum up all of Nichijou in one word, it would be \"beautiful.\" As a slice of life, this anime can't be for everyone, as most people like to have a story that is actually driven by the plot. But even if you aren't into slice of life anime, there is something in Nichijou for everyone to enjoy.\r\nStory:\r\nEvery episode is a series of semi-random \"moments\" in each of the characters' lives. As far as an actual storyline goes, there is no distinct beginning or end to Nichijou. No goal, no real conflict - as to be expected of a slice of life,\"storyless.\" However, at about the halfway point, I started to question whether all of Nichijou somewhat revolves around Nano and her dreams of leading a normal, everyday life (which is what \"nichijou\" roughly translates to). There are some really beautiful moments that do advance the plot, which is part of what makes Nichijou so special as a slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nStunning. Characters are distinct, cute, and thoroughly enjoyable to look at. Animation has very fluid movements, and the \"camera\" work, especially during the funny scenes, is just brilliant. One thing that I particularly adore about this anime is the fact that, as opposed to some anime like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, in which the art style becomes overly-simplistic during moments of comedy, Nichijou's art style becomes vastly more serious and dramatic for almost all of the hilarious moments. Without losing an ounce of fluidity, Nichijou will abruptly switch from cute and colorful to intense, fast-paced action with over-the-top explosions and yelling. Everything about the art in this anime is something to behold.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nHats off to Hyadain, as he did both of the OP songs and one of the ED songs, which are fun and upbeat, as expected of him. The background music is also very well-done, it's unobtrusive and mellow, allowing the characters themselves to set the mood more so than the music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is the glue that holds the entire thing together. The characters make up for the lack of a concrete story and then some - this anime is definitely NOT just something pretty to look at. During the few times that the plot progresses, so do the characters. They learn and grow, they have problems and they help each other. I found myself growing attached to all of the characters, I don't think there is a bad one in the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I love this anime. It is certainly beautiful in more ways than one, and it stands above many other anime in terms of being a slice of life and a comedy. If you like Lucky Star and Gintama, I can almost assure you that you'll have a blast with this anime. I know I sure did!",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nThis is an anime that I went into with high expectations. I was told OVER and OVER online that this was one of the funniest anime series to ever exist! I don't think I laughed once. I'm not just saying that I didn't get any sidesplitting laughs out of this, I don't think this series made me smile more than 2 times! Nichijou is certainly a series with an outstanding online reputation, but in this case I don't feel that the reputation was well deserved. \r\nBackground:\r\nNichijou was actually a bit of a flop in Japan and wasn't able to build a large Japanese fandom. However,it became a massive hit on the English speaking internet after 4chan latched onto it. For the last 3 years, Nichijou fans have been to /a/ what the bronies are to /b/! They are an absolutely devoted cult that recycle the same tired image macros OVER and OVER and team up the attack anyone that doesn't worship this piece of shit. Much like the Bronies, it is very difficult to tell how many actually like the show and how many embrace it entirely out of irony. Considering Nichijou is a comedy that is less funny than dropping a hammer on your big toe, I would say the latter is likely. Most of the humor consists of Japanese language puns and wordplay that doesn't translate well to a non-Japanese audience and even Japanese audiences didn't like it! This places Nichijou in a similar humor category as Vampire Holmes, which I also hated. The rest of the humor is \"uber moe UGUUU\" BULLSHIT, and tired slapstick gags that were old when Charlie Chaplin used them in the 1920s.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is simply the everyday life of a group of schoolgirls. Nichijou seems to borrow elements from both Azumanga Daioh and Cromartie High School without ever coming CLOSE to achieving the same level of humor and charm. A portion of this was that Azumanga and Cromartie had hilarious characters, while Nichijou just has really obnoxious characters. If I had to compare Nichijou to another anime it would be Lucky Star, but a version of Lucky Star that toned down all the anime and gaming references, leaving only the most mundane topics like finding a skirt that fits. Each of the characters fits into a well established archetype, but that alone doesn't explain why it's so bad. The Italian \"commedia dell'arte\" plays recycled the same stock characters and still won over audiences with their farcical humor. It is the combination of bland characters, linguistic humor lost in translation, tired gags, and horrible comedic timing that all come together to make this show a nearly un-watchable clusterfuck. If the show told a purposely bad joke and stretched it out until it became awkward for the audience, that would actually get a few laughs. When used right even \"dead air\" can be a useful comedic tool. Consider the opening of the famous comedy movie \"Spaceballs\". The joke is that the ripoff Star Destroyer is absurdly long in comparison to the ones in Star Wars, but that alone wouldn't be funny. It becomes funny because it just keeps going...and going...and going until the audience laughs because they don't know how to react. Nichijou just hits the audience with one bad joke after another in rapid succession like a machine gun of FAIL.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound:\\n\\n\r\nHere is where Nichijou got its points from. The opening theme is at least kind of catchy and the animation has moments where it shines. Having said that, I fucking HATE the art style of this series for taking even \"moe\" to a new rock bottom.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to tell other people online that Nichijou is great in order to fit in, go for it! However, I warn you to NOT actually bother watching Nichijou yourself because it is a massive waste of time. There are few experiences more annoying that watching a horrible comedy with no laughs. Avoid this anime like the plague!",

They are only good for a couple of weeks at most, and of no use to anyone once the show is finished.\r\nAnd yet I sit here, writing this review. I am fully aware that this review will become useless waste of space, it is inevitable, but having seen the series average MAL-score of 7.6, I decided to make a statetment:\r\nNichijou is fucking awesome.\r\nThe animation is outta this world (at least as far as slice of life is concerned) and the execution is flawless. The timing of the jokes is so, so good, and the physical natureof almost every scene really floats my boat. I love the characters, I love the voice actors, I love the music and I love that goat guy's butler. This is the show that could actually beat Azumanga Daioh at its home turf, and damn, I've longed to say that.\\n\\n\r\nThis score should by no means be viewed as final. It is work in progress, like the series itself (I usually don't rate unfinished shows). But at this point in time, at episode two, Nichijou has done a wonderful job of launching itself as a top dog of the 2011 spring season. Hell, maybe even the entire year!",

            "content": "Nichijou is to me, one of a kind. It emphasizes what seems to be the essence of slapstick comedy, but induces your favorite lighthearted scenario all within the same episode. If you were keen of Lucky Star, Azumanga Daioh, Hidamari Sketch, or Pani Poni Dash, then you would definitely know what I'm talking about. Except, Nichijou, or \"EveryDay\", takes a twist and turn every now and then to let you know this is not so ordinary, and from there, you're on a wonderful ride to a pure fun and blownout comedy. \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nNot at any point, did I criticize Nichijou for its direction of plot,because first of all, I knew what I was getting myself into, whoever reads the synopsis, or look at the cover even, can obviously expect slice of life and nothing else. It baffles me that there are still idiots (trolls) out there who complain and complain about these shows as if they expected some sort of abysmal plot (I know I might be feeding them at this very moment lol). That's besides the point, Nichijou is episodic, and it's good at it too, that's that. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9/10\\n\r\nThis. If it did not have this, such a high production value, the enjoyment to this show would be severely cut in half. From your principal wrestling a random wild deer, to chasing down your best friend to retrieve a notebook that contains indecent sketches of your crush you accidentally handed over, it is all done, with the utmost 'epic' of animations I have ever seen in a slice of life, and given that there's no plot, this is a strong and important point to my overall enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nFirst thing that caught my attention, wow that opening song, I didn't have to watch it a second time to know that it would become something that will eventually be like a broken replay button stuck in my own head. It's cute, catchy, fun and it captures the feel of the show perfectly. Other than the brilliant OP's, the sound effects for small things, like pouring a cup of tea, or the clear brilliance of using almost every famous and hardcore VA to voice-over an assemble of no-faced soldiers who are just a figment of Yuuko's (The airhead of our show) stupidity. No complaints. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThis show is character driven, it is almost impossible to dislike any character, because he or she provides you with entertainment despite what they might be doing. This show is separated into segments for the most part, meaning within the episodes of this episodic show, its episodic within itself. You switch from the school life of Mio, Mai and Yuuko, 3 best friends who let us wander upon their lollygagging, all to just live in the moment. Then we go to the home of the Professor and her robot friend, who she created herself, and happens to be about 8 years old, where the light-hearted part of the show shines, if you can't \"Awww\" at least once to the Professors' charades then I think your moe button needs to be repaired immediately. There is an extreme variety of characters, so you will be entertained. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nAn honest score, to say the least. I truly am happy I stumbled upon this show because for one, I saw the entire thing with my girlfriend, and she loved it, and now the both of us are sad that it's over, and two, there just needs to be more animes out there like this. I know, I know! It's too much to ask for more than one brilliant anime a year but come on, be real, it's what we want! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nSo If you want a good laugh, or more than a laugh.. If you want to \"lmao\", then yup, I recommend! \\n\\n",

            "content": "So... here we are. Another review to make you decide if this anime is worth it or not. Let me tell you something, this anime is FUCKING WORTH IT! I swear to god, this anime is so funny, you'll squeal like a school girl when you see a new episode come out. \r\nSo what's so special about this anime? As the name suggests, it says My everyday life, right? Guess what? Chicken butt.\r\n...\r\n Okay back to the guess what, it's not. As much as we were to taught to read the title to learn what the story is about, this anime is not the case.This anime is FAR BEYOND being \"everyday\" as much as this story can be a slice of life, it's not always. It is SO RANDOM that my \"guess what\" joke could be part of that anime and it would be like me saying, \"Hey, I found these egg head guys playing jump rope half naked.\" and no one would think it was weird or random I said that.\\n\\n\r\nSo enough of my praising, let's go on to the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: So the story is this... nothing. Just absolutely nothing except that it's about the life of Yukko, Mai and Mio at school and everyone around them. At first you see also Nano-chan and the mini professor, but later on they are also part of the story of the three main characters. Other than that... everything is just shorts of complete and udder randomness and chaos, full of hilarity that you'll roll on the floor laughing.Sometimes even laughing your ass off.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also the helvitica standard shorts, which are just complete random shorts that sometimes don't make any sense, but sometimes do. They do leave you laughing and a WTF? face.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is very simple but yet, it really meshes with the randomness. It seems like its really part of the story.  You know you are in for a treat when you see the OP and EP, all mixed around and random.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music in the OP and EP are so... in tune with the randomness of the story and the visual art of the OP and EP. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: What can I say about the characters? They are so random that it seems normal in their world.\\n\\n\r\n Like there's this girl who always have a gun with her and blows the head off this guy, and yet no one even hears the gun shots or see them or how she even got some of the weapons or where they came from.\\n\\n\r\n Another example is Mai-chan... she is as someone said in a comment below one of the videos I was watching, \"A Ninja Troll\" She always has a serious face, everything she does is so random and funny, you don't know if she's really just joking around or is plain serious. Not only that, she always does it to mess with one character for no reason, which makes it funnier and random. She always has some kind of weird artifact with her at school and no one says anything to her, she can get away with anything (which is also funny).\\n\\n\r\n Yukko is also one that does so much random stuff, for attention as a reason, sometimes the characters ignore her (which makes her want to try harder for reactions.) or they give in to her weirdness and react. (I guess to stop her for try again. lol)\\n\\n\r\n Mioi seems to be the only one who's normal, as she's the one who reacts as one would react if we saw the weird stuff all the time, but sometimes exaggerates (but her motions are so funny, you can't help but laugh at her outbursts). But at times has days were she's as equally as random as others.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the mini professor and Nano, they are half random and half normal. \\n\\n\r\nThe mini professor is so smart she made Nano (Who is a robot... to our surprise) she's very sweet and polite, but because she's a robot she has certain... malfunctions that make her random without her trying to be. (example a swiss roll coming out of her arm or a sweet coming out of her forehead.)The one thing that she wants that is always (but not always) a running gag is her trying to get the professor to take off her key from her back which she says \"Makes everyone think she's a robot and she want's to be normal\" and the more she hides it and says she's not the more is obvious that she is a robot. \\n\\n\r\nThe professor is so interesting, yet she acts like a little kid, which is funny and cute at the same time. I love her to death! She's so cute and so childish you can't help wonder if she's really acting like that or she's really smart and just acting like for some reason.Or if she's really a genius at all...\\n\\n\r\n Then there's sakamoto the cat. He's a talking cat, and is very serious... but sometimes gives in to his cat-ness. Always the butt of Professor's antics and in turn a bit mean to her. Everytime she does something bad and Nano yells at her she says, \"Sakamoto-san told me to do it.\" And he's all like, \"What?\" Sometimes blaming him works, sometimes both of them get blamed, other than that its funny when she does that. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Ever since I seen the first episode... I have loved this series. I love the randomness, I can try to compare to azumanga diaoh but really they both seem the same but Nichijou seems more random to me. It's very funny, sometimes the jokes seem like it won't make you laugh but when you see the looks at the characters for their reactions,you can't help but laugh. I say it's a good show to have if you want a good laugh and randomness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Watch it.... I know if you like comedy as much as I love it, you'll laugh at the randomness and the WTF? moments.\\n\\n\r\nScores:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10\\n\\n\r\nEdit: I'm sorry if I posted this twice, I had to edit it and it kept showing the pre-edited one.",

From KyoAni? Yes, the good people in KyoAni once again wants us to feel like \"Gods\" viewing from above on significant event of people just doing what they do. Living.\r\nNichijou or \"My Ordinary Life\" may be viewed as paradoxical to it's title but I beg to differ. I feel the entire content of the whole story generated by the authorbasically describe my entire daily routine. I greet some of my friends in a foreign language, I take a test that I didn't study for, I copy over my friend's homework, I draw two naked guys having sex in my notepad... etc, etc... Yep, pretty normal to me. Except I don't have a loli professor and I don't ride an animal to college. (Calling my roommate an animal would just be insulting) Damn, that's a huge let down. \\n\\n\r\nAs suggested, the story is simple. Just your average daily life varying from the different unique characters. Random encounters (No, not those pokemon encounters) normal daily conversations, you know, \"Hi, I ate your chocolates\" \"GO TO HELL!\" Those sort of things....\\n\r\nThese are those boring life routine which most viewers want to escape and that's the main reason why many of you choose to dwell in the anime world. \\n\\n\r\nArt wise was pretty refreshing to me. Once in a while, I would love to see those sort of \"grainy\" animations which is exceptionally suitable for this genre of SOL/ comedy. Sound? Wow, one of the most random and best opening theme song I've heard so far. It perfectly summarized the entire series. The selection of seiyuus was suitable for each character. Doesn't everyone love the cat's voice? Yes, I know you do.\\n\\n\r\nEvery KyoAni's SOL animes have very distinctive character.\\n\r\nAioi Yuuko, the laid back girl, provides most of the punch line in the series, watching her reactions never fails to amuse me.\\n\r\nMio Naganohara, the studious type, have to put up to much of Aioi's antiques. Sounds familiar? Yep you should, she's the best friend that you keep on bugging to let you copy your homework but she gives it to you anyways because she secretly had a crush on you but you let her down when you started dating with her best friend. Yep thats her.. Sigh.. Story of my life... Anyways...\\n\r\nand last but not least, Mai Minakami, the quite, nerdy looking one with long black hair but very susceptible to bad jokes.. How susceptible? Remember Binkan salaryman and his susceptibility to pigs? Yep.. THAT susceptible..\\n\r\nOther than that, character are balanced out, especially the age difference. Equal number of old and young people. Yes, I can here you lolicons out there booing but I'm sorry your days of loli girls and tentacle rape is over... \\n\\n\r\nLike Hen Zemi, Nichijou uses quite a number of word play which may confuse our younger audience but fear not, the comedy department already covered that quite well even though the usage of comedy is not that heavy.  You may hear a lot of critics about this anime, saying it's too boring, too much talking or what not, it's boring watching people living etc etc but you should always take a stand for yourself. If you enjoy SOL animes coupled in with a few gag jokes, then Nichijou is for you. \\n\\n\r\nYes, many of you think it's boring but that's what the Almighty one had to do for all these millennium. So instead of spending 24 hours on anime, go out there once in a while. Life isn't boring because it is fated that way. Follow Nichijou's example, and make life as interesting as possible.\\n\\n\r\n\"Selamat Malam!\"\\n\r\nYes, I used that right because I'm going to sleep now!\\n\\n\r\nHaremu Kingu,\\n\r\nSigning off!",

            "content": "My first impression of this show after finishing the first episode was a simple \"what the **** is this?\" And now, 15 episodes in, Nichijou has done nothing to change that.\r\nFrom the epic imaginative world of Suzumiya Haruhi to the everyday laughter filled schoolyard of Lucky Star to the soul-wrenching vicissitudes of life that is Clannad, I had great expectations for Kyoto Animation's newest anime. However, Nichijou managed to somehow ignore all of them. \r\nLacking in story, continuity, character development, setting establishment, and everything else that goes into making a book, manga, anime, etc., Nichijou is completely devoid of substance. It doesn't provide the creativeplot and story-boarding of Haruhi, it has none of soulful depth of Clannad, and it fails utterly in replicating the smart humor and rapier wit of Lucky Star. \\n\\n\r\nInstead, Nichijou seems to focus on drawing random people with random personalities doing random stuff in random ways. Every episode begins with random unfunny lines and end with random unfunny lines. And after every episode, I find I still don't know what's going on, still don't care at all about the characters (except maybe for Mio), and still don't know why I just sat through another 24 minutes of this thing.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the only two areas this show does not fail are sound and art. And though the sound track doesn't fail, it doesn't succeed either - it's \"okay\", acceptable, not noteworthy in the least. The art, on the other hand, is done beautifully; without having to worry about developing plots, characters, and scripts, Kyoto Animation could afford to splurge on art. The animation and presentation too, I suppose, is acceptable; it's clearly an attempt to emulate the style of Akiyuki Shinbou over at Shaft... though, if one wants actual artsy presentation, one should directly check out Mr. Shinbou's works.\\n\\n\r\nA final note: if you're a fan of Kyoto Animation, don't watch this show.",

            "content": "Nichijou is a perfect example of a show that tries too hard to ride off the success of other shows. It's not that anything it does is bad, it's just that other shows do what Nichijou does much better.\r\nLet's get the obvious stuff out of the way. The anime I can relate Nichijou to the easiest is Lucky Star. I haven't seen Lucky Star in a while, but I do remember enjoying it overall, despite some flaws. The thing is, all of the problems I had with Lucky Star, I had with Nichijou as well. And the main issue was the story.\r\nThe story in Nichijouis nonexistent. That's NOT why I'm criticizing it though. Lots of great anime don't have stories (Azumanga Daioh, K-On.) The problem here is that nothing in Nichijou seems to be related. An average episode is literally just a bunch of random clips put together. Nothing about these clips are related. They don't all tell one story, nor do they relate to a certain theme. Lucky Star had this exact same problem, but Nichijou takes it up to eleven. I guess one could argue that it's somewhat similar to a variety show like Monty Python or Saturday Night Live, which is a solid argument, but I don't really think it pulls it off that successfully.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue was that I just didn't find a lot of Nichijou funny. I'm not going to blame the anime for that entirely. This show is obviously aimed at a Japanese audience, so of course I won't understand certain references or jokes that play on words. I'm sure a Japanese person wouldn't find South Park all that funny. However, I find it hard to believe some of the scenes in this show would even count as a joke in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nThere's one particular recurring segment called \"Short Thoughts,\" which is literally a short scene, followed by some kind of remark the character is thinking in their head. Not a single one of these were funny. One where Sakamoto falls for a trap by the Professor is followed by \"At least she's very clever\" or something like that.A lot of the jokes are also repeated. There's one joke in one of the later episodes that's pretty much repeated word-for-word in the following episode.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say nothing in Nichijou is funny though. There was always at least a few scenes per episode that made me laugh. The problem was though, that for every scene I enjoyed, there were at least two that bored me.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou has a massive amount of characters. There's six main characters, but there are a bunch of supporting characters. None of the supporting characters are that great. Most of them are extremely predictable. They'll react to completely different situations exactly the same. And the show spends WAY too much time with them.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are much more interesting, but they still have their flaws. Mio was the most enjoyable for me personally. She was probably the least predictable character, and I found her freakouts quite funny. Yukko's overreactions were funny at first, but they eventually became monotonous because they were virtually the same. The Professor is a genius little girl, which is a funny concept, but the show spends much more time focusing on her little girl side. I don't it even shows her genius side. She'll run into the room with a new invention once in a while, but she is never seen creating them, nor does she speak any technical jargon. I don't have many complaints for Nano and Sakamoto. They were fine, but not my favorite characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe only main character I flat out didn't like was Mai. Pretty much anything she tried to pass as a joke fell flat on her face. And I was somewhat angered by the way she treats her friends. She'll pretend to help them out, when she's only making their situations worse. And she apparently encourages her dogs to bite them. I don't see how Mio and Yukko could possibly stand her. When I was in school, kids like Mai where the kind of kids that sat alone at the lunch table and had no friends because they took advantage of any genuine attempt at friendship.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Nichijou is pretty fluid. It's done by Kyoto Animation, which a very excellent studio, and they definitely put a lot of effort into it. However, I can't say I'm a big fan of the art style. It's very simple, which isn't always a bad thing, but I don't like how everyone's nose is ultra-pointy, or how certain character's eyes are simply two straight lines. There are a lot of scenes where they play with the art style, everything will become very detailed, or sometimes even less detailed. They definitely pull it off well, and it helps add to the humor.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is actually one of the few things that Nichijou does better than Lucky Star. Both OPs are very catchy, I had the 2nd one stuck in my head for a long time. I also really like the 1st ED. The other EDs aren't that memorable, but they're not really bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty good too. I'm not too good at recognizing Japanese seiyus, but I do recognize Minoru Shiraishi, who does a great job as Sakamoto. Most of the others are relatively new, but they do a fine job as well.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou isn't a bad anime, but I didn't particularly enjoy it that much either. The humor isn't that great and the characters are a huge mixed bag. That said, a lot of the complaints I have are probably why others like this show, so if you were a massive fan of Lucky Star, then you would absolutely love this anime.",

Nichijou features obnoxious characters, jokes that drag on and a uneventful setting. \r\n--\r\nStory: There is no real story to Nichijou. Minor events that happen before are acknowledged later on, but don't have any impact.\r\n--\r\nCharacters: The characters fall flat on their faces. Obnoxious, their \"character traits\" are over-exposed and take away from the almost-jokes the series try to tell.\r\n--\r\nComedy: Most jokes drag on for too long and lacka proper punchline. Random jokes are just dreams or imagination from a character with no fantastic element. Unfunny running jokes. Fail everywhere, everytime, hard.\\n\r\nThere are a few interesting scenes and funny moments, such as an principal suplexing a deer, but that's a one second scene in a 5 minute joke. Watching a 25 episode for 10 seconds of almost-laughter is just not worth it. Watch something better\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nArt: The only praise I can give to Nichijou. The animation is fluid and contributes to the (few) funny jokes, and the character design is quite nice. However, without proper content, it's not enough to call Nichijou a decent anime.",

            "content": "How does one describe ordinary. Any dictionary will probably describe ordinary as \"Something that is commonly encountered, usual\" or something to that effect. So how does a show like Nichijou (which roughly translates to Regular Life) get a title like... well Nichijou. A show with robots, wigs, deer, and all manner of unusal things is anything but... ordinary right? Perhaps they titled it like this as a bit of a joke, to bounce off all the crazy stuff that is to come. But I think there is a little bit more behind the title than first meets the eye. Lets find out shall we?\r\nOk, letsstart from the beginning. Waaaaaaaayyyyyy back in 2011, Nichijou first aired. I was in the motion of looking for something new to watch so I was keeping an eye on the new releases. When I glanced over Nichijou, my initial reaction was \"hmmm high school slice o'life comedy... heh\". Nothing immediatly jumped to my attention as a \"must watch anime\". Slice of life has always been very hit and miss with me... so I decided it probably wasn't worth my time and moved on to watch other things. \\n\\n\r\nBut... and I'm not entirely sure why... something stuck with me. When I first saw the ad for Nichijou, there was a picture of a girl, standing somewhat alone on top of a trash pile (with a few characters in the background), holding a flower pot. The most notable thing about the character was a giant wind up toy screw sticking out of her back. At the time I dismissed it but the image somehow stayed floating around somewhere in my subconscious. The art style just appealed to me, it was so simple and yet somehow a little bit elegant. And so, a couple of months after it finished airing, I decided to watch the series. I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou is a very odd series to review. Like most slice of lifes (slice of lives?), there isn't really a plot. Its just that... a slice of life, a little piece of a characters life. Or in Nichijou's case, many characters lives.  Its a formula that is almost entirely dependant on how well the audience can relate to the character in question. There are other factors too of course, being a comedy, the humor itself is obviously important, and things like art and sound add bits here and there, but above all else, characterization is the key to its success. And well, in that regard I think Nichijou succeeded far beyond my expectations. \\n\\n\r\nLets start with the main characters. We basically have 2 groups, one being a young High school girl named Yuuko, with her 2 friends Mai and Mio, the other being a Robot named Nano, who lives with a child professor and a talking cat named Sakamoto. Wait what, talking cats, child professors, ROBOTS... do go on. Yes Nichijou certainly has its fill of odd and wacky characters, but to be honest, they are all very relatable and loveable characters. Each of them are funny in their own way, but they also have some very down to earth, even touching moments. \\n\\n\r\nBut, to be honest, the side characters are also pretty hilarious. Its funny, the series kind of jumps from story to story, sometimes lingering on one for less than 10 seconds, sometimes lasting for over 5 minutes. And yet it never feels confusing or cluttered. I don't think there was a single character I didn't at least somewhat enjoy watching, and it became very enjoyable to wonder in the little 5 second breaks between each short segment, as to who we are going to meet next. \\n\\n\r\nOk, so the characters are all well and good, but that can't be it can it? Well no, theres obviously more to it than that. Lets start with the comedy. To be honest... this is the part that tears me apart a little (just a little mind you). There are some freaking hilarious scenes in this show, but there are also some jokes that fall kind of flat. A lot of the jokes in this series (especially the ones between Mai and Yuuko) are more... \"weird\" than funny. I feel like there are a lot of puns in this series too, which isn't a bad thing, but seeing as I can't speak a lick of Japanese they usually won't mean anything to the average english speaking viewer.  But I don't think the bad or the weird jokes are enough to do the series any harm. For each joke that falls flat, there are 2 or 3 more that will have you grinning from ear to ear. So I think the comedy holds up very well as well. As a final little touch, I think the art and music are both very well done. The art is so simple, but it just works so well. It captures the mood of the series perfectly I think. The sound too I think is amazing. There is a little bit about half way into the series that has no dialouge, about the girls building a tower of cards. I won't give away what happens, but the orchestra accompaniment makes it feel like its straight out of Fantasia. Overall very well done.\\n\\n\r\nLooking back over this little piece on Nichijou... I still think something is missing. My head tells me that it isn't exactly that amazing of a series. While quite strong.. the characters are good and the comedy is good... its not anything special right? It doesn't step over any boundries, its not the funniest thing I've ver seen... so why do I love it so much? I think the reason is, above all else, this series has a wonderful beautiful atmosphere to it. While there are some very wacky moments, the series will always take time to slow things down and create a very peaceful and relaxing atmosphere as well. Everytime I watch an episode, a feeling comes over me. I feel safe, I feel at home. I'm in a world that I'm used to, that I've come to love. Its not perfect, there are some flaws here and there, but here it is cheerful... peaceful... ordinary. \\n\\n\r\nIf theres one thing this series has to teach... its that ordinary is in the eye of the beholder. What might seem ordinary to you, might be completely alien to another. But its that regular stuff you take for granted... Your Ordinary Life... that makes you who you are. Enjoy it to the best of your abilities.",

Having sat through 10 episodes of this, maybe I can save someone else the trouble.\r\nI love good slice of life and I love good gag. This fails epically on both counts. It is too surreal and too absurd to be considered slice of life. It is not funny at all either.\r\nWorse of all - and the reason why I stopped watching - the characters are completely dislikable. It renders the anime simply unwatchable because the end result is about as pleasant as hearing chalk squeak on a blackboard. This animewill waste your time with: Absurd, nonsensical non-storylines, which could be funny, if it wasn't so damned infuriating because the characters are not endearing, but disgusting. \\n\\n\r\nThe formula is this: A couple of characters are down on their luck. Nothing they do ever works out. Their wishes and actions are always frustrated. Sometimes by circumstance. Most often however, by the rest of the huge cast, who conspire to make their lives miserable. NOT my idea of fun.",

            "content": "\"Brevity is the soul of wit.\"\r\n-William Shakespeare\r\nIf you're expecting a typical Kyoto Animation slice-of-life anime, this is pretty much that type of show. And much like most of their other shows, I find it pretty boring.\r\nNichijou is what the title indicates: ordinary lives. However, this show's gimmick is that it overexaggerates everything. The characters are all the same type of characters that we've already seen in other shows like this: the dumb one who tells shit jokes, the Straight Man, the perpetually-serious one who does crazy shit for no reason, the Child Prodigy, the annoying Tsundere, etc.\r\nThe problem with Nichijou is that it tries toohard to be funny with material that isn't that funny, like they're trying to overcompensate for the lack of humor. As a result, since Mundane Made Awesome is practically the only type of humor that this show uses, a lot of scenes are dragged out, so a scene that should last about 30 seconds often lasts up to 2-3 minutes, even if they aren't jokes to begin with. A good example of this being the \"moe desu\" scene. Even if the idea of the joke was funny, it gets stretched out for so long that it gets less funny and more boring. The point of a joke is to make you laugh, and not look at the running time, wondering when it's going to be over.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I don't like the Mundane Made Awesome humor is because it feels lazy: practically every other scene is like that, like they were too lazy to come up with any actual jokes, and so they just relied on that for most of the time. To back up the Padding argument, several times per episode, they just show scenery with nothing going on. These scenery shots often last 15-20, or even up to 30 seconds. Put together, these scenes often take up to 2 minutes per episode.\\n\\n\r\nI did like the animation fluidity, and the \"Like Love\" segments are genuinely sweet. I also found a few non-MMA scenes amusing, like the deer-wrestling scene. But I don't rate shows based on animation quality. Like an article said, the funny scenes are just too far apart from one another, being separated by multiple episodes of boredom. I feel like the show could have benefited from being shorter. That would have resulted in less padding, and the funny scenes wouldn't have been so far apart.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I felt this show suffered from dull characters and dragged-out scenes, and I didn't feel there was anything else to make up for it. Watch if if you want, you might like it or you might not, but if you're like me and you're not a fan of this kind of humor but still want to check it out, I would recommend just watching the funny scenes on Youtube rather than watching the whole show, because it gets old quick, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is just one man's opinion, so watch the show if you want and judge for yourself if you like it or not.",

            "content": "Before I start with this review, I want to say: this is my first review. Maybe it'll be short for some of you people and probably, the only one I'm going to write. So please bear with me and with my lack of experience when it comes to review things. If there's something you'd like to tell me about the review itself or how wrong I am for not liking such \u201cfunny and original piece of art\u201d, then you're free to do it, leaving the comments in my profile.\r\nWhen a cartoon, show or any form of entertainment tries way too hard to excel in themedia or meet people's expectations, a disaster can happen. In my opinion, Nichijou is a disaster of an anime. And I dare to say that I've never seen such failure when it comes to this kind of anime (slice of life, comedy, whatever). It seems that the people behind this cartoon have fallen in a deep well, in despair due to lack of inspiration and to get out of that well, they did the unthinkable. Another way to say it is \u201cthey lost their sanity\u201d. Maybe that sums the whole thing up. Nichijou is insane, in the worst and most annoying way possible.\\n\\n\r\nWe're all fans of good comedy and of having a laugh sometimes, right? I think the most important thing about comedy, is how the jokes are pulled off. To be more clear, I'm saying that the jokes have to be shown or presented in a clever way, connected to the story and giving them some sense, to fully understand them or enjoy them. That's exactly what Nichijou does wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThis cartoon (and maybe many others around there that we don't know about) relies way too much in \u201crandomness\u201d. Random jokes that you wouldn't expect to be shown or that defies the common sense and insults intelligence. When that happens, some people may react with laughs and complete satisfaction, and others, included yours truly, might wonder \u201cWhat in the world am I going to see next?\u201d  Because honestly, there is no such thing as sanity or good manners in Nichijou. Oooh no, there is none. All that there is, is an uncontrollable desire to destroy in the most shameless way possible, all related to good comedy. That's it.  It just pukes all over it and throw it to the garbage can and good riddance.\\n\\n\r\nThe exaggeration of the common situations happened in the show is one of the things that I hate about it. It gets old and the worst thing of all, is that it never stops. For series this long (26 episodes in total), is truly a torture to watch the whole thing. This should've been 13 or 14 episodes because it really doesn't deserve that much \u201cdevelopment\u201d. Development that is non-existent. I can understand that some people might like some of the stuff that happens here and how often they get magnified, but let's face it: for the most part, it is truly the worst way to be funny. The most notable example of this, is Misato Tachibana, the tsundere character of the show (what is anime without a tsundere girl, am I right? Hahaha ugh). Because of how shy she actually is, she \u201chides\u201d her embarrassment by using heavy weaponry towards the boy she likes. Can't go on more detail about it, because is so stupid, but if you watched the show until the end, you obviously know what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to talk in more specifics things of the anime and give them a rating separately, to finish it with an overall score. Just like many people do here.\\n\\n\r\nStory: I'd say there's no story at all. Just three normal girls (at the beginning) that go to high school, have normal lives and face unique and crazy situations. For most \u201cslice of life\u201d this isn't much of a problem. However, Nichijou begs for a more explainable story to get out of the boredom and predictability that are always present, as the show goes on. The \u201cHelvetica Standard\u201d shorts and the other random sections don't help with this matter at all, it just makes it worse. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Can't really say much about this. Art here isn't bad at all. The backgrounds are pretty nice, the animation is fluent and dynamic and the overall design of characters and scenarios is well made. No major complains here. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing special. The opening and ending songs are okay. On the other hand, the music used in the actual show aren't something to talk about with too much passion. Forgettable and barely noticeable. The voice acting is okay as well. Some annoying voices here and there, but for characters like Hakase and Nano, that's the common thing. \u201cCute\u201d characters are the ones who get the most irritating voices and Nichijou is not the exception. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Sadly, I didn't like any of them. Is impossible to like them, seriously. They all have their own personality but they all get dragged to the same kind of situations, they all end up being jokes themselves and their development is just\u2026 terrible, which ends up on non-likeable and hateful characters overall. Mai and Hakase are the worst characters in Nichijou, hands down. They're absolutely despicable and is more noticeable with each episode. Hakase is worse than Mai, because she's a little girl and takes advantage of that to be completely disrespectful and obnoxious in general and towards Nano. For me, is like Haruhi Suzumiya, but 10 times worse. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: With all the things I already said about the show and the characters, would you expect me to say that Nichijou is a fun, enjoyable anime? Of course not. There is no reason to sit through all 26 episodes of this thing. You'd waste less time searching for the funny parts in YouTube. I watched this always expecting for something good or not stupid to happen, but no. The slow pace of the almost non-existent story intensifies the feeling of boredom. Unfunny jokes, hateful characters, a horrible pace, and a lot of other things, make Nichijou, something unbearable. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Bad, horrible, a torture, Hell and many other words can describe Nichijou perfectly. It does whatever it wants and with bad intentions. Its \u201crandom XD lulz XD\u201d comedy style isn't something I'd like to witness ever again in my life. If the show was shorter (less episodes and 12 minutes per episode), I wouldn't throw so much insults to it, but considering how long it is and how the jokes are, it makes someone wonder \u201cWhy?\u201d. Yes, why does this exist? Why did they did it this way? Wasn't there someone to test the quality of this show or something? Obviously not, I don't think that's how this industry really works but maybe you get my point. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show isn't for everyone, at all. If you're looking for some laughs and funny random situations, wherever they come from, then Nichijou is for you. If you're looking for something good and at the same time, well made, then stay away from this anime, as much as you can. I know, opinions are a subjective matter, but I couldn't stay in peace without saying what I really think about Nichijou.  \\n\\n\r\nThe slice of life genre is a really risky one. Yuru Yuri was bad. Lucky Star is still horrible and for a long time, I thought that was the worst 'slice of life' anime I've ever seen. But when I watched Nichijou, it was like \u201cDamn! Did they did this on purpose?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. (if there are any typos, I'm sorry)",

            "content": "\"Our everyday lives may, in fact, be a series of miracles.\"\r\nNichijou is the anime adaption by Kyoto Animation of the eponymous manga by Arai Keiichi. In a way, it might be one of the most important series in recent years, and in another way it's just a loveable comedy dense in quality and unadulterated joy of the art of animation. At 26 episodes, setting and keeping the bar high can be a tough job, but Kyoto Animation tackles any issues head-on and what remains is an awe-inspiring amount of everything that keeps anime fans in the medium. Nichijou translates to roughly \u201ceveryday\u201d, as in ordinaryor regular. But the show stays true to the quote above and is able to present unique, bizarre and completely ridiculous situations taken from \u201ceveryday life\u201d but turned up to 11.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I explain why, I\u2019ll declare right away that after much consideration I\u2019ve named Nichijou my absolute favorite anime that I\u2019ve ever seen. I want readers to know and consider my bias, as a review will never be truly objective.\\n\\n\r\nI've been wondering what word I would assign Nichijou. One single word to define the experience as a whole. The word I'm leaning towards is 'modern', mainly because of its presentation. Nichijou takes place in a crisp, colorful, detailed and absolutely beautiful, animated world full of quirks and memorable little doodles and characteristics. As first-time viewers will soon come to realize: A LOT of money went into Nichijou. Art and animation is treated as not only a way to convey images or adapt them from the manga, KyoAni frequently experiments with the art direction and animation to create some of the most brilliant moments of anime where the art and writing come together to not only complement one another but to carry a joke or situation to heights previously impossible. I don't say this lightly, but Nichijou may be (in more ways than one) the most beautiful anime I have ever seen in terms of visuals. No matter if you've seen over 300 series prior to this, you will find something new and something impressive. But it's not only beauty, detail, experimentation and innovation Nichijou's art does--it's also memorability. Nichijou\u2019s strongest 10 goes to the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending singles all offer something refreshing and new while tying the show together in a way that few songs manage to do. The two opening singles by Hyadain are memorable in the best of ways, but also set the stage with the fast tempo and energetic sound. The word \u201cmodern\u201d comes to mind again. The first opening, Kataomoi, feels especially fresh and lively. I could not imagine a better pick for this show even if the lyrics don\u2019t belong quite as well as the second opening with its theme around friendship. The two songs capture the insanity of the gags, but also tie into some of Nichijou's underlying themes like love and friendship. The result is a duo of openings that not only represents the series but brings it to life while bringing the viewer into the right frame of mind while the equally beautiful ending themes closes up each episode. The ending themes, particularly Zzz, is the perfect closer. The music slows down the frantic pace of the rest of the show while its lyrics will urge the listener to take a breath and think about what\u2019s been going on. It\u2019s like a review of the episode, letting the viewer appreciate and reflect on what they\u2019ve seen as they \u201cgo to bed\u201d, fitting the theme of the ending track. The second series of endings has a different animated short which I felt I had to mention. The fly-by of the town at dusk and seeing all the characters off-camera making their way home is entertaining every time. I never skipped the ending as there was always something to look at. The soundtrack itself can either be subdued or bombastic depending on the scene, building tension or releasing it. Not only does the soundtrack work, the way the sound interacts with the scenes is what sets it apart. I\u2019m mainly reminded of the temple scene in the rain, where the total absence of music raises the tension to an unbearable level.\\n\\n\r\nThe real stars of Nichijou\u2019s sound is the sound of its stars, the main characters and their excellent voice actors. I especially want to offer my appreciation for Mio and Yuuko\u2019s actresses for pulling off some amazing cries and screams. Unlike the high-pitched whine of usual anime girls, they\u2019re raw, hoarse and the resulting contrast is absolutely hilarious. Of course, the entire cast does a great job at getting the humor of each situation across, as well as each individual character\u2019s personality. For example, Nano isn\u2019t only the motherly high-school robot because she\u2019s written that way, it\u2019s because it\u2019s in her voice.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou\u2019s format is basically loosely-tied sketches with short animation snippets like \u201cLove-like\u201d and \u201cHelvetica Standard\u201d thrown in-between. I feel that Nichijou uses this format to its limit, picking and choosing the best parts for jokes while being able to throw in unrelated jokes now and then. The show centers on mainly six characters in two separate environments: Mai, Yuuko and Mio together in their classroom, and Nano, Hakase and Sakamoto in the Shinonome Lab. While it is a standard, the girls come visit the laboratory and Nano joins the three in school later on in the show. This way it feels much more fluid to watch and the characters can mix and interact. Unlike other comedies and slice-of-life shows, Nichijou has a rich cast of side characters with their own lives, sketches, quirks and jokes. What really impresses me is the attention they give to each character and how well-written the mains are. Yuuko isn\u2019t just the dumb, genki girl that Mio has to keep in check, she has a different relationship with Mai as the one who has to retort her jokes and \u201ctroll attempts\u201d. Not only that, she\u2019s misunderstood and even a relatable character to someone who is a \u201cblack sheep\u201d while still being funny.\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019ve probably entertained the thought \u201cwhat if a certain studio had unlimited funds and worked on something they really wanted to do?\u201d That\u2019s what I think Nichijou answers. It\u2019s a labor of love for the KyoAni staff, and proof of the talent they have on board. When I watch this show, I feel the creativity and love they put in, and in the end it\u2019s what makes Nichijou what it is. The finale is a heartwarming ode to friendship and the everyday, and the overarching message is revealed like something that had been right in front of you all this time. It\u2019s so obvious and so basic you can\u2019t help but smile and wipe away a tear. Underneath all the insanity and surreal situations lies something humble. It wants you to love what you have, even if it\u2019s been there so long you hardly ever notice it. In its own way, Nichijou heals you.",

            "content": "New generation anime sitcom has arrived\u2026\r\nA spiritual successor to two of my favorite anime sketch comedies of all time (Azumanga Daioh and Pani Poni Dash), Nichijou delivers the comedy 110% percent. Based on the manga of the same name, this is a perfect example of how a situational/sketch comedy should be made. \r\nAnyone trying to find some objective story to this will ultimately blow their minds in front of their faces, as there is none. Hence Situational comedy, because its basically a group of people in high school and we\u2019re there to watch the hilarity ensue. Typically things like this center themselves around a fewmain characters, but this series lends itself to a few dozen characters. For anime novices, I would recommend not to watch this sort of stuff considering, the sheer amount of Japanese popular culture references will make anyone\u2019s head spin. But if you know what an Arikawe Prize or yakasoba or Japanese word games, this show makes learning about J-culture fun and entertaining.\\n\r\nAs many series tend to steer towards fanservice central, this series bumps the moe factor from a 10 to a 11. Even so much as putting little 5-10 second spots having Nano and Hakase dance around or play kids games. Nothing but a white background and them just having fun. This pretty much sums up this whole series in my opinion. The sheer power of how these characters can emit so many emotions and enjoyment out of the viewer is something to behold. I highly suggest watching only a few episodes at a time as you will probably laugh so hard you\u2019ll soon run out of laughter, which CAN happen. Among the normal high school comedy that is Nichijou there are little sketch segments called Small thoughts, Helvetica Standard, and Igo Soccer Club. Each type have their own little charm and feel right at home in this series. It\u2019s hard to really hate this series. \\n\r\nNormally comedy series have very average to poor production value, in which they rely on the characters and the comedy to carry the series to popularity (Gagyu Biyori Manga). In a rare event, this series easily has the highest production value of any Slice of life sitcom. The HD quality really shines; each sketch segment has their own style and just really made my jaw drop at the quality I was looking at. I mean I found myself wondering many times how long it took them to draw a broken melon bread still in its package or how they managed to properly draw a Blue popsicle run over by a bicycle. It\u2019s crazy how many man hours this 26 episode series took. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they spent 1-2 million yen per episode as its quality is comparable to Gunsligner Girls (1st season episodes were worth roughly 1million yen each)\\n\r\nI\u2019m glad that I can finally see an anime sitcom of high quality that also has a high quality production value. I can\u2019t bring myself to say this is better than Lucky Star as that series holds something special in my heart (on a personal level) but I can easily say its ranked between #1 and #2 as my favorite comedy of all time. Please please PLEASE, make more like this Kyoto Animation. \\n",

            "content": "\"A beautiful disaster-piece\" is what I use to describe Nichijou. While watching, I couldn't help but find myself to be so engaged, eyes literally almost glued to my screen. That's how great it was. There are many things I loved about Nichijou which makes it one of my personally favorites.. \r\nI'll start right off the bat and say that what I loved most was the characters. In my many years of watching anime, many shows have come close, however none can touch the amount of likable and hilarious characters Nichijou provided with. A few of the things I liked and loved about the characters wasthat each of them \"as the shows title gives it away\" live their own unique daily lives. However, no life can be complete without any problems or distress, and that's were comedy comes in. I really enjoyed how even though the characters were in either really ridiculous or bad situations their was always something hilarious or heartwarming to lighten my mood.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I loved about the cast of characters was their personalities. Personality, Personality in character is something that helps you decide whether you like a character or not, (in my opinion of course.) In Nichijou there were too many characters with certain personalities that I could either relate to or enjoyed seeing which really earned the show some respect points from me.\\n\\n\r\nNow, with the story, it was there, however like some slice of life shows, Nichijou doesn't actually have any specific story.. to say the least. It's again, just what you expect from the title a bunch of moe characters living an somewhat ordinary life.\\n\\n\r\nSome things that I did like about the somewhat existent story was that there was always some sort of moral or lesson behind certain things that took place during the show. \\n\\n\r\nSomething else that really stood out to me was the artwork done in the story. The show transitions to and from different styles at times which I found rather unique. However, the biggest thing that I liked, which really worked well with the show it that the artwork is simple. What I mean by that is that there isn't anything that stands out too much. (Other than Nano's key lol) but jokes aside, the simple settings and character designs work out well because you really get to focus on what's happening to certain characters without getting distracted much by lets says flashing backgrounds, large settings, etc. So keeping things simple really worked with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Nichijou is really delightful, cheerful, and overall a bit above average.  I really like the opening and ending songs, which was one thing that I didn't like at first. The first intro song I got sort of annoyed with it but after a while it grew on me, then when it changed, I started to dislike the second opening and just like the first, it grew on me. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors were also really good, there was a pretty great cast in Nichijou. Some of my favorites were Mai Aizawa, who does Uryuu Minene on Mirai Nikki or Future diary, Minoru Shiraishi who also provides vocals for another character on the Future diary, and lastly, I seriously adore Konno Hiromi because she does lots of voices for other shows I like such as (Future diary. Lucky Star. and Air.)\\n\\n\r\nSomething really amazing that I loved so much about nichijou was no matter whose life I was watching in Nichijou, again, I was completely engaged, there is so much enjoyment, joy and laughter in the show that I can say without any doubt  that the show is family friendly. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I'm giving this show 9/10 not only because it's one of my personal favorites, but because it left a very good impression on me. If I had more time to watch it I would, Nichijou was a really great show recommended to me from fans of Lucky star, and I'm really glad that I was able to watch it.",

            "content": "When your entire show relies on gag comedy, and the majority of that gag comedy relies on subverting expectations, and most of those subverted expectations end with something random rather than clever, you've taken comedy and beat it down to its worst form.  The lolrandom form, which is the form that Nichijou loves best.  It's a sketch show, and all sketch shows are bound to be hit-or-miss.  Nichijou is just a lot of misses with maybe a hit or two sprinkled in every five episodes.  Maybe it's just my sense of humor, but a lot of the humor relies too heavilyon being \"randum\", and being random alone, to me, isn't very funny at all.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1\\n\\n\r\nThere is no story.  They attempt to build something resembling a plotline nearing the end but it just ends up feeling unnecessary.  Nothing much to say here, you shouldn't be expecting a story from a sketch comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nDamn, those backgrounds.  The artwork is beautiful, and why wouldn't it be when that was where most of the budget was pumped, and in incredibly large amounts, too.  The backgrounds are great, the characters are simple, and occasionally the animation gets really good.  Of course, the quality of animation doesn't stay consistently good enough to get the show anything higher than a 7, because for most scenes it's pretty standard animation for the complexity of the characters and objects that are being animated.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very cutesy, and the whole style of the show is simplistic, which adds a childlike charm to it all.  I just wish that instead of 26 episodes of interspersed quality animation, there had been something like 13 episodes of really good animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely nothing I'm going to remember in particular.  The OPs for both cours were nice, but that's about it.  The background music is forgettable, and the themes aren't good enough to be memorable.  \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is fine, for most of the characters.  Nothing really spectacular outside the main duo, Yuko and Mio.  Those two alone really pulled up the score for the sound, since the voice actors did such a good job.  Can't really say much about the other characters, because while the voices were fitting they weren't really anything spectacular.  The forgettable music drags the score down to a three.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe characters at least have some personalities.  The main problem with the characters is that their respective gags get played out too soon and too quick, and then get replayed for the next 13 episodes.  Nano is embarrassed about being a robot, Mio gets really angry sometimes, Mai is just... weird, we get it.  Too many of the jokes rely on the same personality traits for the main characters, and it gets old.  The characters lose a lot of quality when they're made so one-dimensional by allowing one certain trait to define them.  \\n\\n\r\nAt the very least, the characters have personalities that fit a comedy setting.  The main trio complements each other nicely, if that's even something you can complement shows for, considering you'd expect that main characters wouldn't be polarizing in a comedy show.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the characters are rather forgettable because the characters themselves are walking gags.   If you turn your characters into jokes, then they're only going to be remembered as jokes, not as characters, and Nichijou crosses that line.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest, I laughed a couple of times and there were some moments that were genuinely enjoyable.  Does that mitigate the rest of the 26 episode series that I spent waiting for something enjoyable or funny to happen?  Obviously not.  It isn't worth the time to watch the whole series just to watch the handful of actually funny scenes scattered throughout.\\n\\n\r\nYou'd have a much easier, and much better, time just going on Youtube and looking up the funny clips from Nichijou.  You'd save a lot of time by just watching the clips that are actually funny and avoiding the time spent being confused and bored with the show.  The characters aren't memorable or interesting enough to justify watching the whole show just to get the experience.  You'd get the same experience watching those few select scenes and only lose out on a couple of hours you could have wasted waiting for those scenes to show up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1\\n\\n\r\nThe show should have been shorter, so as to not spread out the good scenes so much, because that's really what kills it for me.  The writers experiment too much.  It's like a comedian who writes down a bunch of jokes but doesn't edit any of them out before a show, so he stands in front of the audience and tells 20 misses and 2 hits.  Do people laugh at the hits?  You're god damn right they do.  Does that justify sitting through the 20 misses?  No it does not.  Nichijou runs into the same problem.  It spends too much time alternating between comedic scenes and ones that are just either serene, sad, or just slice of life rather than comedy.  If you ask me, the writers should have cut out a lot of the scenes.  I know humor is subjective, and that different people think different things are funny, but a lot of the scenes in Nichijou feel unnecessary and could have been left out so that you don't have to spend too much time waiting for the next scene that will tickle your subjectively unique sense of humor, because you are a special snowflake.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't to say that the show isn't funny.  It just isn't funny TO ME.  Which is why I gave it a one.  And like I've explained previously, it's because I don't really take enjoyment from lolrandom type comedy, and that's what most of the show is.  You could think it's the funniest damn thing on Earth, but that's all a matter of what you consider to be funny.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This show is still airing, so opinions are subject to change.\r\nStory: (6/10)\r\nThe story is alot like Lucky star, or K-on in that sense, that it simply is about cute girls doing cute things. It doesn't have the most catching plot, but if you enjoy randomness, filled with cute girls, then I guess this is your cup of tea.\r\nArt:  (10/10)\r\nKyoAni has done it once again. The art in this show is simply marvelous. Not because it is super detailed, but because it is unique. The use of colours and animation makes, this a very enjoyable experience. The characters in the show have those very bigeyes, which Kyoani are so well known for.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nWow... To put it into words, will be very hard, but I will try my best. Let's start with the voices. The voice actors do a very good job. KyoAni is known for using voice actors who \u00e6re relatively new, but even if that is the case, they don't fail to impress. The music in this show is unique in that sense that it is almost never used in Japanese animation. The music reminds me alot of the music you hear in animation from the west, like Curious George, or Oggy and the Cockroaches, and various Disney films. It is nice to see this used in Anime for once, and I think it fits perfectly with the art style and the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very intriguing. Most of the cast is compromised of cute school girls, which most slice of life anime today are. The difference here from other anime isn't that stunning, but it doesn't fail to impress because of that. Their wacky and yet subtle personality makes the characters enjoyable. With that said, you will sometimes still feel like \"What the heck were they talking about right there?\" since there are ALOT of \\n\r\n\"BLA BLA\" conversations between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is overall very enjoyable, but I can't help thinking, that this anime might be more suited for minors instead. Nonetheless, if you enjoy randomness and occasional \"what in the...\" moments you should definitely watch this.",

            "content": "Most anime I watch are completed simply for the sake of completing it, because I made a vow to myself never to list an anime in my own list as \"dropped\" the moment I started it.\r\nNichijou will never be one of those types of anime. It is amazing. Never in my life have I watched an anime filled with so much randomness. Even Lucky Star which has held the undisputed king of randomness anime spot on my list has been dethroned within minutes of the first episode being aired.\r\nThis is my first review BTW so forgive me if this review sucks or anything. All theratings are just my personal opinion\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nI give 10/10 in story for an anime which has no story, but this is precisely why it is so damn amazing. There are jokes placed at almost every corner of each episode, with the timing of each being so perfect that I wonder how much time the producers take to come up with each joke at each precise timing. And where else can one find anime that has people bringing in machine guns to school, riding a goat to school, or even wrestling a deer in school? And I haven't even gone to what happens outside of school. I have found myself laughing time and again that my mother has knocked on my door plenty of times to find me in a laughing fit. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is not perfect, I've seen animes with slightly better art than this, but I find this kind of artwork suits this anime very well. It looks simple at times but it fits in very well, while scenes that required plenty of details are, well, very detailed. I find myself to be rather amazed by the artwork at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nWith such a wide cast of characters it's gotta be hard to find good VAs for every character who can bring out their true personality and colour, but thankfully they have done it. Most characters, if not all, have VAs that have successfully portrayed their characters style and personality, while others have not gotten enough air time for me to determine that. The BGM is great too, often going well with the scene that is going at that moment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI love the characters here. Yuuko as the dumb one, Mio as the sensible one always keeping Yuuko in check, and Mai as the silent one who always own Yuuko (and sometimes Mio) in whatever she does. These 3 make the perfect combination within the confines of their classroom. Outside the classroom, however, we have Hakase the childish one (literally), Nano the caretaker robot who is oft abused by Hakase, and Sakamoto the cat as the one maintaining the sensibility within the household. And not forgetting the side characters, the teacher (whose name I don't remember) who is scared of students, the goat rider whose looks reminds me of Katsuragi Keima of The World God Only Knows, the mohawk guy, and the principal, among many others. All of these characters converge together to make one of the most entertaining animes I have ever watched. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Sakamoto is my favourite. The moment he made his introductory speech I knew I was going to love him, and he hasn't disappointed\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nNeed I say more? This entire review has been about how great this show is and how much I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime is very very much enjoyable, but it probably is not suited for people who don't like randomness anime, who'd rather be able to tell what's going to happen next. This is personal preference, and as a person who watches a lot of such animes filled with randomness, I have to say it's one of the best such animes I've watched.",

            "content": "Conventional wisdom has always taught us that more is usually better. We think that the more expensive car should have more completely unrelated features, the better ice-cream sundae should have a bigger pile of fresh fruit on top, and the better statistics report should be able to pull more numbers out of it\u2019s arse. We compare phones by the multitude of apps it can run, our enjoyment of horror films is based on how many different ways the various victims die, and we often rate anime by how many story arcs, characters, subplots and themes it can cram into it\u2019s 26 episode season. \r\nAs themodern entertainment sector continues to emphasize excess and surplus, Nichijou is a much welcome, and frankly much needed throwback to a more old-school approach to entertainment. Nichijou\u2019s frugal yet distinct style reminds us that something is perfect, not because there\u2019s nothing more to add to it, but because there is nothing more to take away.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou brings to us a fusion of gag, moe, slice-of-life and slapstick comedy. It\u2019s humor is very reminiscent of Azumanga Diaoh while it\u2019s art style borrows heavily from the distinctly colorful palette of Lucky Star. Nichijou adopts a very light-hearted approach with it\u2019s tone; it\u2019s jokes are played fast and loose, and while there is a constant shift of pacing throughout each episode, Nichijou never seems to take itself very seriously. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most noteworthy thing about Nichijou is it\u2019s production value. Frankly speaking, Nichijou is GORGEOUS to look at; it\u2019s animation so incredibly fluid and it\u2019s art so crisp and vivid that it actually puts other supposedly competent studios to shame. The artwork selects it\u2019s palette very sparingly, with a result that is both vibrant yet easy on the eyes. This gentle tone is then frequently punctuated by segments of metaphorical (and in some cases literal) animation explosions, showcasing KyoAni\u2019s talent with a huge variety of styles from gritty realism to crayon slapstick. \\n\\n\r\nOne can\u2019t help but wonder if KyoAni isn\u2019t deliberately showing off their workmanship with this anime. Many originally very short panels from the manga are translated into incredibly imaginative and stunning sequences of animation that simply scream \u201cbecause we can.\u201d Show off or not, Nichijou\u2019s cinematography is nothing short of outstanding; it\u2019s liberal interpretation of the original source material has really allowed the creativity of director Ishihara Tatsuya and the KyoAni animators to shine through like nothing we\u2019ve ever seen before.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial mention to Nichijou\u2019s OP and ED songs, which are creative shorts (incredibly well sync\u2019d I might mention) in their own right. As a fun fact, both of Nichijou\u2019s OPs are sung by Hyadain, who is ONE guy. No female backing vocals at all, he does it all himself. Seriously I\u2019m not joking, go look it up.\\n\\n\r\nThe aforementioned dynamic pacing forms the basis of Nichijou\u2019s entertainment value. Each episode tackles it\u2019s structure with a large degree of unpredictability. You never know what\u2019s going to happen next, be it a humorous dialogue scene, a fast paced action sequence, an amusing random still image or a hilarious but completely unrelated skit. Despite this seemingly chaotic approach, Nichijou still manages to find a good balance between all it\u2019s various styles so that no episode feels too weighted. While such a haphazard approach may seem counter-intuitive for a slice-of-life anime, this style ends up working greatly in Nichijou\u2019s favor, adding another layer to it\u2019s texture of absurdity.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor itself is very simplistic, almost to a fault, and one would normally attribute this as one of Nichijou\u2019s flaws. That is of course until you remember that \u201cNichijou\u201d translates to \u201cMy Ordinary Life\u201d and as such, the simplicity of the jokes are a fitting homage to the show\u2019s title and premise. Many of the jokes are simply exaggerated normal events like missing the train or a waiter forgetting your order, relying on witty dialogue delivery and clever timings to get the humor across. Some may consider this a hit-or-miss sort of comedy, which is only a fair judgement. All the same, you don\u2019t necessarily have to laugh at jokes like these to appreciate them, which is one of the main reasons why slice-of-life can have such a widespread appeal (remember K-On?)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very likable, despite the obvious utilization of moe in many of their design. If you can shed that manly exterior and look past the few excessively \u201ccute\u201d scenes, there\u2019s actually an abundance of things to enjoy about Nichijou\u2019s characters. Conventional archetypes are few and far between in this anime, and all the characters harbor their own quirky habits and flaws that you\u2019ll quickly grow fond of.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about Nichijou\u2019s characters however, isn\u2019t their individuality, but how they interact with each other. The personalities of various character groups clash, contrast and complement each other in extremely interesting ways; the conversations and activities of the two golden trios of Nichijou: Yuuko/Mio/Mai and Hakase/Nano/Sakamoto make up the abundance of material in each episode and just their hilarious adventures by themselves could probably carry an entire show. This is furthered by the great voice acting that the Nichijou provides; Nichijou is one of the rare shows where the seiyuus genuinely sound like they\u2019re enjoying themselves. Dialogues are delivered with copious amounts of enthusiasm which really helps sell the spirited relationships that the various characters enjoy with each other.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that has been said though, I would like to come back to that idea I mentioned when we began, that idiom of \u201cless is more.\u201d The thing I love most about Nichijou, isn\u2019t the amazing artwork, the clever cinematography, the light-hearted humor or even the imaginative characters. What I love most about Nichijou is the fact that, behind all the technicalities and production values, lies a very simple ideal. Everything about Nichijou revolves around this central principle of being enjoyable. All that it does, every scene, every character, every line of dialogue alludes back to this principle. Because at the end of the day, all Nichijou wants you to do is one thing; it wants you to enjoy yourself. With Nichijou, there is no story, no subplots, no recurring themes, no character development, no product placement, no lessons to be learnt, no obscure references to pander to a niche audience, no obvious fan-service pandering or ploys to sell related merchandise. \\n\\n\r\nFun is the only thing that matters, and it's this frugality, this ingenious simplicity, that allows everything to just click together like magic.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you finally get home after a long tiring day, the only thing Nichijou wants to do is to give you an excuse to prop your feet up after and wash that blue feeling away as it slowly puts that grin back onto your face.",

            "content": "If I had to sum up all of Nichijou in one word, it would be \"beautiful.\" As a slice of life, this anime can't be for everyone, as most people like to have a story that is actually driven by the plot. But even if you aren't into slice of life anime, there is something in Nichijou for everyone to enjoy.\r\nStory:\r\nEvery episode is a series of semi-random \"moments\" in each of the characters' lives. As far as an actual storyline goes, there is no distinct beginning or end to Nichijou. No goal, no real conflict - as to be expected of a slice of life,\"storyless.\" However, at about the halfway point, I started to question whether all of Nichijou somewhat revolves around Nano and her dreams of leading a normal, everyday life (which is what \"nichijou\" roughly translates to). There are some really beautiful moments that do advance the plot, which is part of what makes Nichijou so special as a slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nStunning. Characters are distinct, cute, and thoroughly enjoyable to look at. Animation has very fluid movements, and the \"camera\" work, especially during the funny scenes, is just brilliant. One thing that I particularly adore about this anime is the fact that, as opposed to some anime like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, in which the art style becomes overly-simplistic during moments of comedy, Nichijou's art style becomes vastly more serious and dramatic for almost all of the hilarious moments. Without losing an ounce of fluidity, Nichijou will abruptly switch from cute and colorful to intense, fast-paced action with over-the-top explosions and yelling. Everything about the art in this anime is something to behold.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nHats off to Hyadain, as he did both of the OP songs and one of the ED songs, which are fun and upbeat, as expected of him. The background music is also very well-done, it's unobtrusive and mellow, allowing the characters themselves to set the mood more so than the music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is the glue that holds the entire thing together. The characters make up for the lack of a concrete story and then some - this anime is definitely NOT just something pretty to look at. During the few times that the plot progresses, so do the characters. They learn and grow, they have problems and they help each other. I found myself growing attached to all of the characters, I don't think there is a bad one in the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I love this anime. It is certainly beautiful in more ways than one, and it stands above many other anime in terms of being a slice of life and a comedy. If you like Lucky Star and Gintama, I can almost assure you that you'll have a blast with this anime. I know I sure did!",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nThis is an anime that I went into with high expectations. I was told OVER and OVER online that this was one of the funniest anime series to ever exist! I don't think I laughed once. I'm not just saying that I didn't get any sidesplitting laughs out of this, I don't think this series made me smile more than 2 times! Nichijou is certainly a series with an outstanding online reputation, but in this case I don't feel that the reputation was well deserved. \r\nBackground:\r\nNichijou was actually a bit of a flop in Japan and wasn't able to build a large Japanese fandom. However,it became a massive hit on the English speaking internet after 4chan latched onto it. For the last 3 years, Nichijou fans have been to /a/ what the bronies are to /b/! They are an absolutely devoted cult that recycle the same tired image macros OVER and OVER and team up the attack anyone that doesn't worship this piece of shit. Much like the Bronies, it is very difficult to tell how many actually like the show and how many embrace it entirely out of irony. Considering Nichijou is a comedy that is less funny than dropping a hammer on your big toe, I would say the latter is likely. Most of the humor consists of Japanese language puns and wordplay that doesn't translate well to a non-Japanese audience and even Japanese audiences didn't like it! This places Nichijou in a similar humor category as Vampire Holmes, which I also hated. The rest of the humor is \"uber moe UGUUU\" BULLSHIT, and tired slapstick gags that were old when Charlie Chaplin used them in the 1920s.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is simply the everyday life of a group of schoolgirls. Nichijou seems to borrow elements from both Azumanga Daioh and Cromartie High School without ever coming CLOSE to achieving the same level of humor and charm. A portion of this was that Azumanga and Cromartie had hilarious characters, while Nichijou just has really obnoxious characters. If I had to compare Nichijou to another anime it would be Lucky Star, but a version of Lucky Star that toned down all the anime and gaming references, leaving only the most mundane topics like finding a skirt that fits. Each of the characters fits into a well established archetype, but that alone doesn't explain why it's so bad. The Italian \"commedia dell'arte\" plays recycled the same stock characters and still won over audiences with their farcical humor. It is the combination of bland characters, linguistic humor lost in translation, tired gags, and horrible comedic timing that all come together to make this show a nearly un-watchable clusterfuck. If the show told a purposely bad joke and stretched it out until it became awkward for the audience, that would actually get a few laughs. When used right even \"dead air\" can be a useful comedic tool. Consider the opening of the famous comedy movie \"Spaceballs\". The joke is that the ripoff Star Destroyer is absurdly long in comparison to the ones in Star Wars, but that alone wouldn't be funny. It becomes funny because it just keeps going...and going...and going until the audience laughs because they don't know how to react. Nichijou just hits the audience with one bad joke after another in rapid succession like a machine gun of FAIL.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound:\\n\\n\r\nHere is where Nichijou got its points from. The opening theme is at least kind of catchy and the animation has moments where it shines. Having said that, I fucking HATE the art style of this series for taking even \"moe\" to a new rock bottom.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to tell other people online that Nichijou is great in order to fit in, go for it! However, I warn you to NOT actually bother watching Nichijou yourself because it is a massive waste of time. There are few experiences more annoying that watching a horrible comedy with no laughs. Avoid this anime like the plague!",

They are only good for a couple of weeks at most, and of no use to anyone once the show is finished.\r\nAnd yet I sit here, writing this review. I am fully aware that this review will become useless waste of space, it is inevitable, but having seen the series average MAL-score of 7.6, I decided to make a statetment:\r\nNichijou is fucking awesome.\r\nThe animation is outta this world (at least as far as slice of life is concerned) and the execution is flawless. The timing of the jokes is so, so good, and the physical natureof almost every scene really floats my boat. I love the characters, I love the voice actors, I love the music and I love that goat guy's butler. This is the show that could actually beat Azumanga Daioh at its home turf, and damn, I've longed to say that.\\n\\n\r\nThis score should by no means be viewed as final. It is work in progress, like the series itself (I usually don't rate unfinished shows). But at this point in time, at episode two, Nichijou has done a wonderful job of launching itself as a top dog of the 2011 spring season. Hell, maybe even the entire year!",

            "content": "Nichijou is to me, one of a kind. It emphasizes what seems to be the essence of slapstick comedy, but induces your favorite lighthearted scenario all within the same episode. If you were keen of Lucky Star, Azumanga Daioh, Hidamari Sketch, or Pani Poni Dash, then you would definitely know what I'm talking about. Except, Nichijou, or \"EveryDay\", takes a twist and turn every now and then to let you know this is not so ordinary, and from there, you're on a wonderful ride to a pure fun and blownout comedy. \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nNot at any point, did I criticize Nichijou for its direction of plot,because first of all, I knew what I was getting myself into, whoever reads the synopsis, or look at the cover even, can obviously expect slice of life and nothing else. It baffles me that there are still idiots (trolls) out there who complain and complain about these shows as if they expected some sort of abysmal plot (I know I might be feeding them at this very moment lol). That's besides the point, Nichijou is episodic, and it's good at it too, that's that. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9/10\\n\r\nThis. If it did not have this, such a high production value, the enjoyment to this show would be severely cut in half. From your principal wrestling a random wild deer, to chasing down your best friend to retrieve a notebook that contains indecent sketches of your crush you accidentally handed over, it is all done, with the utmost 'epic' of animations I have ever seen in a slice of life, and given that there's no plot, this is a strong and important point to my overall enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nFirst thing that caught my attention, wow that opening song, I didn't have to watch it a second time to know that it would become something that will eventually be like a broken replay button stuck in my own head. It's cute, catchy, fun and it captures the feel of the show perfectly. Other than the brilliant OP's, the sound effects for small things, like pouring a cup of tea, or the clear brilliance of using almost every famous and hardcore VA to voice-over an assemble of no-faced soldiers who are just a figment of Yuuko's (The airhead of our show) stupidity. No complaints. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThis show is character driven, it is almost impossible to dislike any character, because he or she provides you with entertainment despite what they might be doing. This show is separated into segments for the most part, meaning within the episodes of this episodic show, its episodic within itself. You switch from the school life of Mio, Mai and Yuuko, 3 best friends who let us wander upon their lollygagging, all to just live in the moment. Then we go to the home of the Professor and her robot friend, who she created herself, and happens to be about 8 years old, where the light-hearted part of the show shines, if you can't \"Awww\" at least once to the Professors' charades then I think your moe button needs to be repaired immediately. There is an extreme variety of characters, so you will be entertained. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nAn honest score, to say the least. I truly am happy I stumbled upon this show because for one, I saw the entire thing with my girlfriend, and she loved it, and now the both of us are sad that it's over, and two, there just needs to be more animes out there like this. I know, I know! It's too much to ask for more than one brilliant anime a year but come on, be real, it's what we want! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nSo If you want a good laugh, or more than a laugh.. If you want to \"lmao\", then yup, I recommend! \\n\\n",

            "content": "So... here we are. Another review to make you decide if this anime is worth it or not. Let me tell you something, this anime is FUCKING WORTH IT! I swear to god, this anime is so funny, you'll squeal like a school girl when you see a new episode come out. \r\nSo what's so special about this anime? As the name suggests, it says My everyday life, right? Guess what? Chicken butt.\r\n...\r\n Okay back to the guess what, it's not. As much as we were to taught to read the title to learn what the story is about, this anime is not the case.This anime is FAR BEYOND being \"everyday\" as much as this story can be a slice of life, it's not always. It is SO RANDOM that my \"guess what\" joke could be part of that anime and it would be like me saying, \"Hey, I found these egg head guys playing jump rope half naked.\" and no one would think it was weird or random I said that.\\n\\n\r\nSo enough of my praising, let's go on to the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: So the story is this... nothing. Just absolutely nothing except that it's about the life of Yukko, Mai and Mio at school and everyone around them. At first you see also Nano-chan and the mini professor, but later on they are also part of the story of the three main characters. Other than that... everything is just shorts of complete and udder randomness and chaos, full of hilarity that you'll roll on the floor laughing.Sometimes even laughing your ass off.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also the helvitica standard shorts, which are just complete random shorts that sometimes don't make any sense, but sometimes do. They do leave you laughing and a WTF? face.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is very simple but yet, it really meshes with the randomness. It seems like its really part of the story.  You know you are in for a treat when you see the OP and EP, all mixed around and random.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music in the OP and EP are so... in tune with the randomness of the story and the visual art of the OP and EP. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: What can I say about the characters? They are so random that it seems normal in their world.\\n\\n\r\n Like there's this girl who always have a gun with her and blows the head off this guy, and yet no one even hears the gun shots or see them or how she even got some of the weapons or where they came from.\\n\\n\r\n Another example is Mai-chan... she is as someone said in a comment below one of the videos I was watching, \"A Ninja Troll\" She always has a serious face, everything she does is so random and funny, you don't know if she's really just joking around or is plain serious. Not only that, she always does it to mess with one character for no reason, which makes it funnier and random. She always has some kind of weird artifact with her at school and no one says anything to her, she can get away with anything (which is also funny).\\n\\n\r\n Yukko is also one that does so much random stuff, for attention as a reason, sometimes the characters ignore her (which makes her want to try harder for reactions.) or they give in to her weirdness and react. (I guess to stop her for try again. lol)\\n\\n\r\n Mioi seems to be the only one who's normal, as she's the one who reacts as one would react if we saw the weird stuff all the time, but sometimes exaggerates (but her motions are so funny, you can't help but laugh at her outbursts). But at times has days were she's as equally as random as others.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the mini professor and Nano, they are half random and half normal. \\n\\n\r\nThe mini professor is so smart she made Nano (Who is a robot... to our surprise) she's very sweet and polite, but because she's a robot she has certain... malfunctions that make her random without her trying to be. (example a swiss roll coming out of her arm or a sweet coming out of her forehead.)The one thing that she wants that is always (but not always) a running gag is her trying to get the professor to take off her key from her back which she says \"Makes everyone think she's a robot and she want's to be normal\" and the more she hides it and says she's not the more is obvious that she is a robot. \\n\\n\r\nThe professor is so interesting, yet she acts like a little kid, which is funny and cute at the same time. I love her to death! She's so cute and so childish you can't help wonder if she's really acting like that or she's really smart and just acting like for some reason.Or if she's really a genius at all...\\n\\n\r\n Then there's sakamoto the cat. He's a talking cat, and is very serious... but sometimes gives in to his cat-ness. Always the butt of Professor's antics and in turn a bit mean to her. Everytime she does something bad and Nano yells at her she says, \"Sakamoto-san told me to do it.\" And he's all like, \"What?\" Sometimes blaming him works, sometimes both of them get blamed, other than that its funny when she does that. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Ever since I seen the first episode... I have loved this series. I love the randomness, I can try to compare to azumanga diaoh but really they both seem the same but Nichijou seems more random to me. It's very funny, sometimes the jokes seem like it won't make you laugh but when you see the looks at the characters for their reactions,you can't help but laugh. I say it's a good show to have if you want a good laugh and randomness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Watch it.... I know if you like comedy as much as I love it, you'll laugh at the randomness and the WTF? moments.\\n\\n\r\nScores:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10\\n\\n\r\nEdit: I'm sorry if I posted this twice, I had to edit it and it kept showing the pre-edited one.",

            "content": "\"Selamat Pagi!\" \r\nHaremu Kingu at your service.\r\nYeah, yeah I know I'm using the word wrong since I'm writing this in the middle of the night but somewhere out there in the world, one of you are reading this in the day so yeah....\r\nAnother SOL anime? From KyoAni? Yes, the good people in KyoAni once again wants us to feel like \"Gods\" viewing from above on significant event of people just doing what they do. Living.\r\nNichijou or \"My Ordinary Life\" may be viewed as paradoxical to it's title but I beg to differ. I feel the entire content of the whole story generated by the authorbasically describe my entire daily routine. I greet some of my friends in a foreign language, I take a test that I didn't study for, I copy over my friend's homework, I draw two naked guys having sex in my notepad... etc, etc... Yep, pretty normal to me. Except I don't have a loli professor and I don't ride an animal to college. (Calling my roommate an animal would just be insulting) Damn, that's a huge let down. \\n\\n\r\nAs suggested, the story is simple. Just your average daily life varying from the different unique characters. Random encounters (No, not those pokemon encounters) normal daily conversations, you know, \"Hi, I ate your chocolates\" \"GO TO HELL!\" Those sort of things....\\n\r\nThese are those boring life routine which most viewers want to escape and that's the main reason why many of you choose to dwell in the anime world. \\n\\n\r\nArt wise was pretty refreshing to me. Once in a while, I would love to see those sort of \"grainy\" animations which is exceptionally suitable for this genre of SOL/ comedy. Sound? Wow, one of the most random and best opening theme song I've heard so far. It perfectly summarized the entire series. The selection of seiyuus was suitable for each character. Doesn't everyone love the cat's voice? Yes, I know you do.\\n\\n\r\nEvery KyoAni's SOL animes have very distinctive character.\\n\r\nAioi Yuuko, the laid back girl, provides most of the punch line in the series, watching her reactions never fails to amuse me.\\n\r\nMio Naganohara, the studious type, have to put up to much of Aioi's antiques. Sounds familiar? Yep you should, she's the best friend that you keep on bugging to let you copy your homework but she gives it to you anyways because she secretly had a crush on you but you let her down when you started dating with her best friend. Yep thats her.. Sigh.. Story of my life... Anyways...\\n\r\nand last but not least, Mai Minakami, the quite, nerdy looking one with long black hair but very susceptible to bad jokes.. How susceptible? Remember Binkan salaryman and his susceptibility to pigs? Yep.. THAT susceptible..\\n\r\nOther than that, character are balanced out, especially the age difference. Equal number of old and young people. Yes, I can here you lolicons out there booing but I'm sorry your days of loli girls and tentacle rape is over... \\n\\n\r\nLike Hen Zemi, Nichijou uses quite a number of word play which may confuse our younger audience but fear not, the comedy department already covered that quite well even though the usage of comedy is not that heavy.  You may hear a lot of critics about this anime, saying it's too boring, too much talking or what not, it's boring watching people living etc etc but you should always take a stand for yourself. If you enjoy SOL animes coupled in with a few gag jokes, then Nichijou is for you. \\n\\n\r\nYes, many of you think it's boring but that's what the Almighty one had to do for all these millennium. So instead of spending 24 hours on anime, go out there once in a while. Life isn't boring because it is fated that way. Follow Nichijou's example, and make life as interesting as possible.\\n\\n\r\n\"Selamat Malam!\"\\n\r\nYes, I used that right because I'm going to sleep now!\\n\\n\r\nHaremu Kingu,\\n\r\nSigning off!",

            "content": "My first impression of this show after finishing the first episode was a simple \"what the **** is this?\" And now, 15 episodes in, Nichijou has done nothing to change that.\r\nFrom the epic imaginative world of Suzumiya Haruhi to the everyday laughter filled schoolyard of Lucky Star to the soul-wrenching vicissitudes of life that is Clannad, I had great expectations for Kyoto Animation's newest anime. However, Nichijou managed to somehow ignore all of them. \r\nLacking in story, continuity, character development, setting establishment, and everything else that goes into making a book, manga, anime, etc., Nichijou is completely devoid of substance. It doesn't provide the creativeplot and story-boarding of Haruhi, it has none of soulful depth of Clannad, and it fails utterly in replicating the smart humor and rapier wit of Lucky Star. \\n\\n\r\nInstead, Nichijou seems to focus on drawing random people with random personalities doing random stuff in random ways. Every episode begins with random unfunny lines and end with random unfunny lines. And after every episode, I find I still don't know what's going on, still don't care at all about the characters (except maybe for Mio), and still don't know why I just sat through another 24 minutes of this thing.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the only two areas this show does not fail are sound and art. And though the sound track doesn't fail, it doesn't succeed either - it's \"okay\", acceptable, not noteworthy in the least. The art, on the other hand, is done beautifully; without having to worry about developing plots, characters, and scripts, Kyoto Animation could afford to splurge on art. The animation and presentation too, I suppose, is acceptable; it's clearly an attempt to emulate the style of Akiyuki Shinbou over at Shaft... though, if one wants actual artsy presentation, one should directly check out Mr. Shinbou's works.\\n\\n\r\nA final note: if you're a fan of Kyoto Animation, don't watch this show.",

            "content": "Nichijou is a perfect example of a show that tries too hard to ride off the success of other shows. It's not that anything it does is bad, it's just that other shows do what Nichijou does much better.\r\nLet's get the obvious stuff out of the way. The anime I can relate Nichijou to the easiest is Lucky Star. I haven't seen Lucky Star in a while, but I do remember enjoying it overall, despite some flaws. The thing is, all of the problems I had with Lucky Star, I had with Nichijou as well. And the main issue was the story.\r\nThe story in Nichijouis nonexistent. That's NOT why I'm criticizing it though. Lots of great anime don't have stories (Azumanga Daioh, K-On.) The problem here is that nothing in Nichijou seems to be related. An average episode is literally just a bunch of random clips put together. Nothing about these clips are related. They don't all tell one story, nor do they relate to a certain theme. Lucky Star had this exact same problem, but Nichijou takes it up to eleven. I guess one could argue that it's somewhat similar to a variety show like Monty Python or Saturday Night Live, which is a solid argument, but I don't really think it pulls it off that successfully.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue was that I just didn't find a lot of Nichijou funny. I'm not going to blame the anime for that entirely. This show is obviously aimed at a Japanese audience, so of course I won't understand certain references or jokes that play on words. I'm sure a Japanese person wouldn't find South Park all that funny. However, I find it hard to believe some of the scenes in this show would even count as a joke in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nThere's one particular recurring segment called \"Short Thoughts,\" which is literally a short scene, followed by some kind of remark the character is thinking in their head. Not a single one of these were funny. One where Sakamoto falls for a trap by the Professor is followed by \"At least she's very clever\" or something like that.A lot of the jokes are also repeated. There's one joke in one of the later episodes that's pretty much repeated word-for-word in the following episode.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say nothing in Nichijou is funny though. There was always at least a few scenes per episode that made me laugh. The problem was though, that for every scene I enjoyed, there were at least two that bored me.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou has a massive amount of characters. There's six main characters, but there are a bunch of supporting characters. None of the supporting characters are that great. Most of them are extremely predictable. They'll react to completely different situations exactly the same. And the show spends WAY too much time with them.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are much more interesting, but they still have their flaws. Mio was the most enjoyable for me personally. She was probably the least predictable character, and I found her freakouts quite funny. Yukko's overreactions were funny at first, but they eventually became monotonous because they were virtually the same. The Professor is a genius little girl, which is a funny concept, but the show spends much more time focusing on her little girl side. I don't it even shows her genius side. She'll run into the room with a new invention once in a while, but she is never seen creating them, nor does she speak any technical jargon. I don't have many complaints for Nano and Sakamoto. They were fine, but not my favorite characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe only main character I flat out didn't like was Mai. Pretty much anything she tried to pass as a joke fell flat on her face. And I was somewhat angered by the way she treats her friends. She'll pretend to help them out, when she's only making their situations worse. And she apparently encourages her dogs to bite them. I don't see how Mio and Yukko could possibly stand her. When I was in school, kids like Mai where the kind of kids that sat alone at the lunch table and had no friends because they took advantage of any genuine attempt at friendship.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Nichijou is pretty fluid. It's done by Kyoto Animation, which a very excellent studio, and they definitely put a lot of effort into it. However, I can't say I'm a big fan of the art style. It's very simple, which isn't always a bad thing, but I don't like how everyone's nose is ultra-pointy, or how certain character's eyes are simply two straight lines. There are a lot of scenes where they play with the art style, everything will become very detailed, or sometimes even less detailed. They definitely pull it off well, and it helps add to the humor.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is actually one of the few things that Nichijou does better than Lucky Star. Both OPs are very catchy, I had the 2nd one stuck in my head for a long time. I also really like the 1st ED. The other EDs aren't that memorable, but they're not really bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty good too. I'm not too good at recognizing Japanese seiyus, but I do recognize Minoru Shiraishi, who does a great job as Sakamoto. Most of the others are relatively new, but they do a fine job as well.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou isn't a bad anime, but I didn't particularly enjoy it that much either. The humor isn't that great and the characters are a huge mixed bag. That said, a lot of the complaints I have are probably why others like this show, so if you were a massive fan of Lucky Star, then you would absolutely love this anime.",

Nichijou features obnoxious characters, jokes that drag on and a uneventful setting. \r\n--\r\nStory: There is no real story to Nichijou. Minor events that happen before are acknowledged later on, but don't have any impact.\r\n--\r\nCharacters: The characters fall flat on their faces. Obnoxious, their \"character traits\" are over-exposed and take away from the almost-jokes the series try to tell.\r\n--\r\nComedy: Most jokes drag on for too long and lacka proper punchline. Random jokes are just dreams or imagination from a character with no fantastic element. Unfunny running jokes. Fail everywhere, everytime, hard.\\n\r\nThere are a few interesting scenes and funny moments, such as an principal suplexing a deer, but that's a one second scene in a 5 minute joke. Watching a 25 episode for 10 seconds of almost-laughter is just not worth it. Watch something better\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nArt: The only praise I can give to Nichijou. The animation is fluid and contributes to the (few) funny jokes, and the character design is quite nice. However, without proper content, it's not enough to call Nichijou a decent anime.",

            "content": "How does one describe ordinary. Any dictionary will probably describe ordinary as \"Something that is commonly encountered, usual\" or something to that effect. So how does a show like Nichijou (which roughly translates to Regular Life) get a title like... well Nichijou. A show with robots, wigs, deer, and all manner of unusal things is anything but... ordinary right? Perhaps they titled it like this as a bit of a joke, to bounce off all the crazy stuff that is to come. But I think there is a little bit more behind the title than first meets the eye. Lets find out shall we?\r\nOk, letsstart from the beginning. Waaaaaaaayyyyyy back in 2011, Nichijou first aired. I was in the motion of looking for something new to watch so I was keeping an eye on the new releases. When I glanced over Nichijou, my initial reaction was \"hmmm high school slice o'life comedy... heh\". Nothing immediatly jumped to my attention as a \"must watch anime\". Slice of life has always been very hit and miss with me... so I decided it probably wasn't worth my time and moved on to watch other things. \\n\\n\r\nBut... and I'm not entirely sure why... something stuck with me. When I first saw the ad for Nichijou, there was a picture of a girl, standing somewhat alone on top of a trash pile (with a few characters in the background), holding a flower pot. The most notable thing about the character was a giant wind up toy screw sticking out of her back. At the time I dismissed it but the image somehow stayed floating around somewhere in my subconscious. The art style just appealed to me, it was so simple and yet somehow a little bit elegant. And so, a couple of months after it finished airing, I decided to watch the series. I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou is a very odd series to review. Like most slice of lifes (slice of lives?), there isn't really a plot. Its just that... a slice of life, a little piece of a characters life. Or in Nichijou's case, many characters lives.  Its a formula that is almost entirely dependant on how well the audience can relate to the character in question. There are other factors too of course, being a comedy, the humor itself is obviously important, and things like art and sound add bits here and there, but above all else, characterization is the key to its success. And well, in that regard I think Nichijou succeeded far beyond my expectations. \\n\\n\r\nLets start with the main characters. We basically have 2 groups, one being a young High school girl named Yuuko, with her 2 friends Mai and Mio, the other being a Robot named Nano, who lives with a child professor and a talking cat named Sakamoto. Wait what, talking cats, child professors, ROBOTS... do go on. Yes Nichijou certainly has its fill of odd and wacky characters, but to be honest, they are all very relatable and loveable characters. Each of them are funny in their own way, but they also have some very down to earth, even touching moments. \\n\\n\r\nBut, to be honest, the side characters are also pretty hilarious. Its funny, the series kind of jumps from story to story, sometimes lingering on one for less than 10 seconds, sometimes lasting for over 5 minutes. And yet it never feels confusing or cluttered. I don't think there was a single character I didn't at least somewhat enjoy watching, and it became very enjoyable to wonder in the little 5 second breaks between each short segment, as to who we are going to meet next. \\n\\n\r\nOk, so the characters are all well and good, but that can't be it can it? Well no, theres obviously more to it than that. Lets start with the comedy. To be honest... this is the part that tears me apart a little (just a little mind you). There are some freaking hilarious scenes in this show, but there are also some jokes that fall kind of flat. A lot of the jokes in this series (especially the ones between Mai and Yuuko) are more... \"weird\" than funny. I feel like there are a lot of puns in this series too, which isn't a bad thing, but seeing as I can't speak a lick of Japanese they usually won't mean anything to the average english speaking viewer.  But I don't think the bad or the weird jokes are enough to do the series any harm. For each joke that falls flat, there are 2 or 3 more that will have you grinning from ear to ear. So I think the comedy holds up very well as well. As a final little touch, I think the art and music are both very well done. The art is so simple, but it just works so well. It captures the mood of the series perfectly I think. The sound too I think is amazing. There is a little bit about half way into the series that has no dialouge, about the girls building a tower of cards. I won't give away what happens, but the orchestra accompaniment makes it feel like its straight out of Fantasia. Overall very well done.\\n\\n\r\nLooking back over this little piece on Nichijou... I still think something is missing. My head tells me that it isn't exactly that amazing of a series. While quite strong.. the characters are good and the comedy is good... its not anything special right? It doesn't step over any boundries, its not the funniest thing I've ver seen... so why do I love it so much? I think the reason is, above all else, this series has a wonderful beautiful atmosphere to it. While there are some very wacky moments, the series will always take time to slow things down and create a very peaceful and relaxing atmosphere as well. Everytime I watch an episode, a feeling comes over me. I feel safe, I feel at home. I'm in a world that I'm used to, that I've come to love. Its not perfect, there are some flaws here and there, but here it is cheerful... peaceful... ordinary. \\n\\n\r\nIf theres one thing this series has to teach... its that ordinary is in the eye of the beholder. What might seem ordinary to you, might be completely alien to another. But its that regular stuff you take for granted... Your Ordinary Life... that makes you who you are. Enjoy it to the best of your abilities.",

            "content": "\"Brevity is the soul of wit.\"\r\n-William Shakespeare\r\nIf you're expecting a typical Kyoto Animation slice-of-life anime, this is pretty much that type of show. And much like most of their other shows, I find it pretty boring.\r\nNichijou is what the title indicates: ordinary lives. However, this show's gimmick is that it overexaggerates everything. The characters are all the same type of characters that we've already seen in other shows like this: the dumb one who tells shit jokes, the Straight Man, the perpetually-serious one who does crazy shit for no reason, the Child Prodigy, the annoying Tsundere, etc.\r\nThe problem with Nichijou is that it tries toohard to be funny with material that isn't that funny, like they're trying to overcompensate for the lack of humor. As a result, since Mundane Made Awesome is practically the only type of humor that this show uses, a lot of scenes are dragged out, so a scene that should last about 30 seconds often lasts up to 2-3 minutes, even if they aren't jokes to begin with. A good example of this being the \"moe desu\" scene. Even if the idea of the joke was funny, it gets stretched out for so long that it gets less funny and more boring. The point of a joke is to make you laugh, and not look at the running time, wondering when it's going to be over.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I don't like the Mundane Made Awesome humor is because it feels lazy: practically every other scene is like that, like they were too lazy to come up with any actual jokes, and so they just relied on that for most of the time. To back up the Padding argument, several times per episode, they just show scenery with nothing going on. These scenery shots often last 15-20, or even up to 30 seconds. Put together, these scenes often take up to 2 minutes per episode.\\n\\n\r\nI did like the animation fluidity, and the \"Like Love\" segments are genuinely sweet. I also found a few non-MMA scenes amusing, like the deer-wrestling scene. But I don't rate shows based on animation quality. Like an article said, the funny scenes are just too far apart from one another, being separated by multiple episodes of boredom. I feel like the show could have benefited from being shorter. That would have resulted in less padding, and the funny scenes wouldn't have been so far apart.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I felt this show suffered from dull characters and dragged-out scenes, and I didn't feel there was anything else to make up for it. Watch if if you want, you might like it or you might not, but if you're like me and you're not a fan of this kind of humor but still want to check it out, I would recommend just watching the funny scenes on Youtube rather than watching the whole show, because it gets old quick, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is just one man's opinion, so watch the show if you want and judge for yourself if you like it or not.",

            "content": "Before I start with this review, I want to say: this is my first review. Maybe it'll be short for some of you people and probably, the only one I'm going to write. So please bear with me and with my lack of experience when it comes to review things. If there's something you'd like to tell me about the review itself or how wrong I am for not liking such \u201cfunny and original piece of art\u201d, then you're free to do it, leaving the comments in my profile.\r\nWhen a cartoon, show or any form of entertainment tries way too hard to excel in themedia or meet people's expectations, a disaster can happen. In my opinion, Nichijou is a disaster of an anime. And I dare to say that I've never seen such failure when it comes to this kind of anime (slice of life, comedy, whatever). It seems that the people behind this cartoon have fallen in a deep well, in despair due to lack of inspiration and to get out of that well, they did the unthinkable. Another way to say it is \u201cthey lost their sanity\u201d. Maybe that sums the whole thing up. Nichijou is insane, in the worst and most annoying way possible.\\n\\n\r\nWe're all fans of good comedy and of having a laugh sometimes, right? I think the most important thing about comedy, is how the jokes are pulled off. To be more clear, I'm saying that the jokes have to be shown or presented in a clever way, connected to the story and giving them some sense, to fully understand them or enjoy them. That's exactly what Nichijou does wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThis cartoon (and maybe many others around there that we don't know about) relies way too much in \u201crandomness\u201d. Random jokes that you wouldn't expect to be shown or that defies the common sense and insults intelligence. When that happens, some people may react with laughs and complete satisfaction, and others, included yours truly, might wonder \u201cWhat in the world am I going to see next?\u201d  Because honestly, there is no such thing as sanity or good manners in Nichijou. Oooh no, there is none. All that there is, is an uncontrollable desire to destroy in the most shameless way possible, all related to good comedy. That's it.  It just pukes all over it and throw it to the garbage can and good riddance.\\n\\n\r\nThe exaggeration of the common situations happened in the show is one of the things that I hate about it. It gets old and the worst thing of all, is that it never stops. For series this long (26 episodes in total), is truly a torture to watch the whole thing. This should've been 13 or 14 episodes because it really doesn't deserve that much \u201cdevelopment\u201d. Development that is non-existent. I can understand that some people might like some of the stuff that happens here and how often they get magnified, but let's face it: for the most part, it is truly the worst way to be funny. The most notable example of this, is Misato Tachibana, the tsundere character of the show (what is anime without a tsundere girl, am I right? Hahaha ugh). Because of how shy she actually is, she \u201chides\u201d her embarrassment by using heavy weaponry towards the boy she likes. Can't go on more detail about it, because is so stupid, but if you watched the show until the end, you obviously know what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to talk in more specifics things of the anime and give them a rating separately, to finish it with an overall score. Just like many people do here.\\n\\n\r\nStory: I'd say there's no story at all. Just three normal girls (at the beginning) that go to high school, have normal lives and face unique and crazy situations. For most \u201cslice of life\u201d this isn't much of a problem. However, Nichijou begs for a more explainable story to get out of the boredom and predictability that are always present, as the show goes on. The \u201cHelvetica Standard\u201d shorts and the other random sections don't help with this matter at all, it just makes it worse. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Can't really say much about this. Art here isn't bad at all. The backgrounds are pretty nice, the animation is fluent and dynamic and the overall design of characters and scenarios is well made. No major complains here. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing special. The opening and ending songs are okay. On the other hand, the music used in the actual show aren't something to talk about with too much passion. Forgettable and barely noticeable. The voice acting is okay as well. Some annoying voices here and there, but for characters like Hakase and Nano, that's the common thing. \u201cCute\u201d characters are the ones who get the most irritating voices and Nichijou is not the exception. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Sadly, I didn't like any of them. Is impossible to like them, seriously. They all have their own personality but they all get dragged to the same kind of situations, they all end up being jokes themselves and their development is just\u2026 terrible, which ends up on non-likeable and hateful characters overall. Mai and Hakase are the worst characters in Nichijou, hands down. They're absolutely despicable and is more noticeable with each episode. Hakase is worse than Mai, because she's a little girl and takes advantage of that to be completely disrespectful and obnoxious in general and towards Nano. For me, is like Haruhi Suzumiya, but 10 times worse. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: With all the things I already said about the show and the characters, would you expect me to say that Nichijou is a fun, enjoyable anime? Of course not. There is no reason to sit through all 26 episodes of this thing. You'd waste less time searching for the funny parts in YouTube. I watched this always expecting for something good or not stupid to happen, but no. The slow pace of the almost non-existent story intensifies the feeling of boredom. Unfunny jokes, hateful characters, a horrible pace, and a lot of other things, make Nichijou, something unbearable. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Bad, horrible, a torture, Hell and many other words can describe Nichijou perfectly. It does whatever it wants and with bad intentions. Its \u201crandom XD lulz XD\u201d comedy style isn't something I'd like to witness ever again in my life. If the show was shorter (less episodes and 12 minutes per episode), I wouldn't throw so much insults to it, but considering how long it is and how the jokes are, it makes someone wonder \u201cWhy?\u201d. Yes, why does this exist? Why did they did it this way? Wasn't there someone to test the quality of this show or something? Obviously not, I don't think that's how this industry really works but maybe you get my point. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show isn't for everyone, at all. If you're looking for some laughs and funny random situations, wherever they come from, then Nichijou is for you. If you're looking for something good and at the same time, well made, then stay away from this anime, as much as you can. I know, opinions are a subjective matter, but I couldn't stay in peace without saying what I really think about Nichijou.  \\n\\n\r\nThe slice of life genre is a really risky one. Yuru Yuri was bad. Lucky Star is still horrible and for a long time, I thought that was the worst 'slice of life' anime I've ever seen. But when I watched Nichijou, it was like \u201cDamn! Did they did this on purpose?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. (if there are any typos, I'm sorry)",

            "content": "\"Our everyday lives may, in fact, be a series of miracles.\"\r\nNichijou is the anime adaption by Kyoto Animation of the eponymous manga by Arai Keiichi. In a way, it might be one of the most important series in recent years, and in another way it's just a loveable comedy dense in quality and unadulterated joy of the art of animation. At 26 episodes, setting and keeping the bar high can be a tough job, but Kyoto Animation tackles any issues head-on and what remains is an awe-inspiring amount of everything that keeps anime fans in the medium. Nichijou translates to roughly \u201ceveryday\u201d, as in ordinaryor regular. But the show stays true to the quote above and is able to present unique, bizarre and completely ridiculous situations taken from \u201ceveryday life\u201d but turned up to 11.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I explain why, I\u2019ll declare right away that after much consideration I\u2019ve named Nichijou my absolute favorite anime that I\u2019ve ever seen. I want readers to know and consider my bias, as a review will never be truly objective.\\n\\n\r\nI've been wondering what word I would assign Nichijou. One single word to define the experience as a whole. The word I'm leaning towards is 'modern', mainly because of its presentation. Nichijou takes place in a crisp, colorful, detailed and absolutely beautiful, animated world full of quirks and memorable little doodles and characteristics. As first-time viewers will soon come to realize: A LOT of money went into Nichijou. Art and animation is treated as not only a way to convey images or adapt them from the manga, KyoAni frequently experiments with the art direction and animation to create some of the most brilliant moments of anime where the art and writing come together to not only complement one another but to carry a joke or situation to heights previously impossible. I don't say this lightly, but Nichijou may be (in more ways than one) the most beautiful anime I have ever seen in terms of visuals. No matter if you've seen over 300 series prior to this, you will find something new and something impressive. But it's not only beauty, detail, experimentation and innovation Nichijou's art does--it's also memorability. Nichijou\u2019s strongest 10 goes to the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending singles all offer something refreshing and new while tying the show together in a way that few songs manage to do. The two opening singles by Hyadain are memorable in the best of ways, but also set the stage with the fast tempo and energetic sound. The word \u201cmodern\u201d comes to mind again. The first opening, Kataomoi, feels especially fresh and lively. I could not imagine a better pick for this show even if the lyrics don\u2019t belong quite as well as the second opening with its theme around friendship. The two songs capture the insanity of the gags, but also tie into some of Nichijou's underlying themes like love and friendship. The result is a duo of openings that not only represents the series but brings it to life while bringing the viewer into the right frame of mind while the equally beautiful ending themes closes up each episode. The ending themes, particularly Zzz, is the perfect closer. The music slows down the frantic pace of the rest of the show while its lyrics will urge the listener to take a breath and think about what\u2019s been going on. It\u2019s like a review of the episode, letting the viewer appreciate and reflect on what they\u2019ve seen as they \u201cgo to bed\u201d, fitting the theme of the ending track. The second series of endings has a different animated short which I felt I had to mention. The fly-by of the town at dusk and seeing all the characters off-camera making their way home is entertaining every time. I never skipped the ending as there was always something to look at. The soundtrack itself can either be subdued or bombastic depending on the scene, building tension or releasing it. Not only does the soundtrack work, the way the sound interacts with the scenes is what sets it apart. I\u2019m mainly reminded of the temple scene in the rain, where the total absence of music raises the tension to an unbearable level.\\n\\n\r\nThe real stars of Nichijou\u2019s sound is the sound of its stars, the main characters and their excellent voice actors. I especially want to offer my appreciation for Mio and Yuuko\u2019s actresses for pulling off some amazing cries and screams. Unlike the high-pitched whine of usual anime girls, they\u2019re raw, hoarse and the resulting contrast is absolutely hilarious. Of course, the entire cast does a great job at getting the humor of each situation across, as well as each individual character\u2019s personality. For example, Nano isn\u2019t only the motherly high-school robot because she\u2019s written that way, it\u2019s because it\u2019s in her voice.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou\u2019s format is basically loosely-tied sketches with short animation snippets like \u201cLove-like\u201d and \u201cHelvetica Standard\u201d thrown in-between. I feel that Nichijou uses this format to its limit, picking and choosing the best parts for jokes while being able to throw in unrelated jokes now and then. The show centers on mainly six characters in two separate environments: Mai, Yuuko and Mio together in their classroom, and Nano, Hakase and Sakamoto in the Shinonome Lab. While it is a standard, the girls come visit the laboratory and Nano joins the three in school later on in the show. This way it feels much more fluid to watch and the characters can mix and interact. Unlike other comedies and slice-of-life shows, Nichijou has a rich cast of side characters with their own lives, sketches, quirks and jokes. What really impresses me is the attention they give to each character and how well-written the mains are. Yuuko isn\u2019t just the dumb, genki girl that Mio has to keep in check, she has a different relationship with Mai as the one who has to retort her jokes and \u201ctroll attempts\u201d. Not only that, she\u2019s misunderstood and even a relatable character to someone who is a \u201cblack sheep\u201d while still being funny.\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019ve probably entertained the thought \u201cwhat if a certain studio had unlimited funds and worked on something they really wanted to do?\u201d That\u2019s what I think Nichijou answers. It\u2019s a labor of love for the KyoAni staff, and proof of the talent they have on board. When I watch this show, I feel the creativity and love they put in, and in the end it\u2019s what makes Nichijou what it is. The finale is a heartwarming ode to friendship and the everyday, and the overarching message is revealed like something that had been right in front of you all this time. It\u2019s so obvious and so basic you can\u2019t help but smile and wipe away a tear. Underneath all the insanity and surreal situations lies something humble. It wants you to love what you have, even if it\u2019s been there so long you hardly ever notice it. In its own way, Nichijou heals you.",

            "content": "New generation anime sitcom has arrived\u2026\r\nA spiritual successor to two of my favorite anime sketch comedies of all time (Azumanga Daioh and Pani Poni Dash), Nichijou delivers the comedy 110% percent. Based on the manga of the same name, this is a perfect example of how a situational/sketch comedy should be made. \r\nAnyone trying to find some objective story to this will ultimately blow their minds in front of their faces, as there is none. Hence Situational comedy, because its basically a group of people in high school and we\u2019re there to watch the hilarity ensue. Typically things like this center themselves around a fewmain characters, but this series lends itself to a few dozen characters. For anime novices, I would recommend not to watch this sort of stuff considering, the sheer amount of Japanese popular culture references will make anyone\u2019s head spin. But if you know what an Arikawe Prize or yakasoba or Japanese word games, this show makes learning about J-culture fun and entertaining.\\n\r\nAs many series tend to steer towards fanservice central, this series bumps the moe factor from a 10 to a 11. Even so much as putting little 5-10 second spots having Nano and Hakase dance around or play kids games. Nothing but a white background and them just having fun. This pretty much sums up this whole series in my opinion. The sheer power of how these characters can emit so many emotions and enjoyment out of the viewer is something to behold. I highly suggest watching only a few episodes at a time as you will probably laugh so hard you\u2019ll soon run out of laughter, which CAN happen. Among the normal high school comedy that is Nichijou there are little sketch segments called Small thoughts, Helvetica Standard, and Igo Soccer Club. Each type have their own little charm and feel right at home in this series. It\u2019s hard to really hate this series. \\n\r\nNormally comedy series have very average to poor production value, in which they rely on the characters and the comedy to carry the series to popularity (Gagyu Biyori Manga). In a rare event, this series easily has the highest production value of any Slice of life sitcom. The HD quality really shines; each sketch segment has their own style and just really made my jaw drop at the quality I was looking at. I mean I found myself wondering many times how long it took them to draw a broken melon bread still in its package or how they managed to properly draw a Blue popsicle run over by a bicycle. It\u2019s crazy how many man hours this 26 episode series took. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they spent 1-2 million yen per episode as its quality is comparable to Gunsligner Girls (1st season episodes were worth roughly 1million yen each)\\n\r\nI\u2019m glad that I can finally see an anime sitcom of high quality that also has a high quality production value. I can\u2019t bring myself to say this is better than Lucky Star as that series holds something special in my heart (on a personal level) but I can easily say its ranked between #1 and #2 as my favorite comedy of all time. Please please PLEASE, make more like this Kyoto Animation. \\n",

            "content": "\"A beautiful disaster-piece\" is what I use to describe Nichijou. While watching, I couldn't help but find myself to be so engaged, eyes literally almost glued to my screen. That's how great it was. There are many things I loved about Nichijou which makes it one of my personally favorites.. \r\nI'll start right off the bat and say that what I loved most was the characters. In my many years of watching anime, many shows have come close, however none can touch the amount of likable and hilarious characters Nichijou provided with. A few of the things I liked and loved about the characters wasthat each of them \"as the shows title gives it away\" live their own unique daily lives. However, no life can be complete without any problems or distress, and that's were comedy comes in. I really enjoyed how even though the characters were in either really ridiculous or bad situations their was always something hilarious or heartwarming to lighten my mood.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I loved about the cast of characters was their personalities. Personality, Personality in character is something that helps you decide whether you like a character or not, (in my opinion of course.) In Nichijou there were too many characters with certain personalities that I could either relate to or enjoyed seeing which really earned the show some respect points from me.\\n\\n\r\nNow, with the story, it was there, however like some slice of life shows, Nichijou doesn't actually have any specific story.. to say the least. It's again, just what you expect from the title a bunch of moe characters living an somewhat ordinary life.\\n\\n\r\nSome things that I did like about the somewhat existent story was that there was always some sort of moral or lesson behind certain things that took place during the show. \\n\\n\r\nSomething else that really stood out to me was the artwork done in the story. The show transitions to and from different styles at times which I found rather unique. However, the biggest thing that I liked, which really worked well with the show it that the artwork is simple. What I mean by that is that there isn't anything that stands out too much. (Other than Nano's key lol) but jokes aside, the simple settings and character designs work out well because you really get to focus on what's happening to certain characters without getting distracted much by lets says flashing backgrounds, large settings, etc. So keeping things simple really worked with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Nichijou is really delightful, cheerful, and overall a bit above average.  I really like the opening and ending songs, which was one thing that I didn't like at first. The first intro song I got sort of annoyed with it but after a while it grew on me, then when it changed, I started to dislike the second opening and just like the first, it grew on me. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors were also really good, there was a pretty great cast in Nichijou. Some of my favorites were Mai Aizawa, who does Uryuu Minene on Mirai Nikki or Future diary, Minoru Shiraishi who also provides vocals for another character on the Future diary, and lastly, I seriously adore Konno Hiromi because she does lots of voices for other shows I like such as (Future diary. Lucky Star. and Air.)\\n\\n\r\nSomething really amazing that I loved so much about nichijou was no matter whose life I was watching in Nichijou, again, I was completely engaged, there is so much enjoyment, joy and laughter in the show that I can say without any doubt  that the show is family friendly. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I'm giving this show 9/10 not only because it's one of my personal favorites, but because it left a very good impression on me. If I had more time to watch it I would, Nichijou was a really great show recommended to me from fans of Lucky star, and I'm really glad that I was able to watch it.",

            "content": "When your entire show relies on gag comedy, and the majority of that gag comedy relies on subverting expectations, and most of those subverted expectations end with something random rather than clever, you've taken comedy and beat it down to its worst form.  The lolrandom form, which is the form that Nichijou loves best.  It's a sketch show, and all sketch shows are bound to be hit-or-miss.  Nichijou is just a lot of misses with maybe a hit or two sprinkled in every five episodes.  Maybe it's just my sense of humor, but a lot of the humor relies too heavilyon being \"randum\", and being random alone, to me, isn't very funny at all.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1\\n\\n\r\nThere is no story.  They attempt to build something resembling a plotline nearing the end but it just ends up feeling unnecessary.  Nothing much to say here, you shouldn't be expecting a story from a sketch comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nDamn, those backgrounds.  The artwork is beautiful, and why wouldn't it be when that was where most of the budget was pumped, and in incredibly large amounts, too.  The backgrounds are great, the characters are simple, and occasionally the animation gets really good.  Of course, the quality of animation doesn't stay consistently good enough to get the show anything higher than a 7, because for most scenes it's pretty standard animation for the complexity of the characters and objects that are being animated.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very cutesy, and the whole style of the show is simplistic, which adds a childlike charm to it all.  I just wish that instead of 26 episodes of interspersed quality animation, there had been something like 13 episodes of really good animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely nothing I'm going to remember in particular.  The OPs for both cours were nice, but that's about it.  The background music is forgettable, and the themes aren't good enough to be memorable.  \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is fine, for most of the characters.  Nothing really spectacular outside the main duo, Yuko and Mio.  Those two alone really pulled up the score for the sound, since the voice actors did such a good job.  Can't really say much about the other characters, because while the voices were fitting they weren't really anything spectacular.  The forgettable music drags the score down to a three.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe characters at least have some personalities.  The main problem with the characters is that their respective gags get played out too soon and too quick, and then get replayed for the next 13 episodes.  Nano is embarrassed about being a robot, Mio gets really angry sometimes, Mai is just... weird, we get it.  Too many of the jokes rely on the same personality traits for the main characters, and it gets old.  The characters lose a lot of quality when they're made so one-dimensional by allowing one certain trait to define them.  \\n\\n\r\nAt the very least, the characters have personalities that fit a comedy setting.  The main trio complements each other nicely, if that's even something you can complement shows for, considering you'd expect that main characters wouldn't be polarizing in a comedy show.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the characters are rather forgettable because the characters themselves are walking gags.   If you turn your characters into jokes, then they're only going to be remembered as jokes, not as characters, and Nichijou crosses that line.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest, I laughed a couple of times and there were some moments that were genuinely enjoyable.  Does that mitigate the rest of the 26 episode series that I spent waiting for something enjoyable or funny to happen?  Obviously not.  It isn't worth the time to watch the whole series just to watch the handful of actually funny scenes scattered throughout.\\n\\n\r\nYou'd have a much easier, and much better, time just going on Youtube and looking up the funny clips from Nichijou.  You'd save a lot of time by just watching the clips that are actually funny and avoiding the time spent being confused and bored with the show.  The characters aren't memorable or interesting enough to justify watching the whole show just to get the experience.  You'd get the same experience watching those few select scenes and only lose out on a couple of hours you could have wasted waiting for those scenes to show up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1\\n\\n\r\nThe show should have been shorter, so as to not spread out the good scenes so much, because that's really what kills it for me.  The writers experiment too much.  It's like a comedian who writes down a bunch of jokes but doesn't edit any of them out before a show, so he stands in front of the audience and tells 20 misses and 2 hits.  Do people laugh at the hits?  You're god damn right they do.  Does that justify sitting through the 20 misses?  No it does not.  Nichijou runs into the same problem.  It spends too much time alternating between comedic scenes and ones that are just either serene, sad, or just slice of life rather than comedy.  If you ask me, the writers should have cut out a lot of the scenes.  I know humor is subjective, and that different people think different things are funny, but a lot of the scenes in Nichijou feel unnecessary and could have been left out so that you don't have to spend too much time waiting for the next scene that will tickle your subjectively unique sense of humor, because you are a special snowflake.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't to say that the show isn't funny.  It just isn't funny TO ME.  Which is why I gave it a one.  And like I've explained previously, it's because I don't really take enjoyment from lolrandom type comedy, and that's what most of the show is.  You could think it's the funniest damn thing on Earth, but that's all a matter of what you consider to be funny.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This show is still airing, so opinions are subject to change.\r\nStory: (6/10)\r\nThe story is alot like Lucky star, or K-on in that sense, that it simply is about cute girls doing cute things. It doesn't have the most catching plot, but if you enjoy randomness, filled with cute girls, then I guess this is your cup of tea.\r\nArt:  (10/10)\r\nKyoAni has done it once again. The art in this show is simply marvelous. Not because it is super detailed, but because it is unique. The use of colours and animation makes, this a very enjoyable experience. The characters in the show have those very bigeyes, which Kyoani are so well known for.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nWow... To put it into words, will be very hard, but I will try my best. Let's start with the voices. The voice actors do a very good job. KyoAni is known for using voice actors who \u00e6re relatively new, but even if that is the case, they don't fail to impress. The music in this show is unique in that sense that it is almost never used in Japanese animation. The music reminds me alot of the music you hear in animation from the west, like Curious George, or Oggy and the Cockroaches, and various Disney films. It is nice to see this used in Anime for once, and I think it fits perfectly with the art style and the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very intriguing. Most of the cast is compromised of cute school girls, which most slice of life anime today are. The difference here from other anime isn't that stunning, but it doesn't fail to impress because of that. Their wacky and yet subtle personality makes the characters enjoyable. With that said, you will sometimes still feel like \"What the heck were they talking about right there?\" since there are ALOT of \\n\r\n\"BLA BLA\" conversations between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is overall very enjoyable, but I can't help thinking, that this anime might be more suited for minors instead. Nonetheless, if you enjoy randomness and occasional \"what in the...\" moments you should definitely watch this.",

            "content": "Most anime I watch are completed simply for the sake of completing it, because I made a vow to myself never to list an anime in my own list as \"dropped\" the moment I started it.\r\nNichijou will never be one of those types of anime. It is amazing. Never in my life have I watched an anime filled with so much randomness. Even Lucky Star which has held the undisputed king of randomness anime spot on my list has been dethroned within minutes of the first episode being aired.\r\nThis is my first review BTW so forgive me if this review sucks or anything. All theratings are just my personal opinion\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nI give 10/10 in story for an anime which has no story, but this is precisely why it is so damn amazing. There are jokes placed at almost every corner of each episode, with the timing of each being so perfect that I wonder how much time the producers take to come up with each joke at each precise timing. And where else can one find anime that has people bringing in machine guns to school, riding a goat to school, or even wrestling a deer in school? And I haven't even gone to what happens outside of school. I have found myself laughing time and again that my mother has knocked on my door plenty of times to find me in a laughing fit. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is not perfect, I've seen animes with slightly better art than this, but I find this kind of artwork suits this anime very well. It looks simple at times but it fits in very well, while scenes that required plenty of details are, well, very detailed. I find myself to be rather amazed by the artwork at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nWith such a wide cast of characters it's gotta be hard to find good VAs for every character who can bring out their true personality and colour, but thankfully they have done it. Most characters, if not all, have VAs that have successfully portrayed their characters style and personality, while others have not gotten enough air time for me to determine that. The BGM is great too, often going well with the scene that is going at that moment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI love the characters here. Yuuko as the dumb one, Mio as the sensible one always keeping Yuuko in check, and Mai as the silent one who always own Yuuko (and sometimes Mio) in whatever she does. These 3 make the perfect combination within the confines of their classroom. Outside the classroom, however, we have Hakase the childish one (literally), Nano the caretaker robot who is oft abused by Hakase, and Sakamoto the cat as the one maintaining the sensibility within the household. And not forgetting the side characters, the teacher (whose name I don't remember) who is scared of students, the goat rider whose looks reminds me of Katsuragi Keima of The World God Only Knows, the mohawk guy, and the principal, among many others. All of these characters converge together to make one of the most entertaining animes I have ever watched. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Sakamoto is my favourite. The moment he made his introductory speech I knew I was going to love him, and he hasn't disappointed\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nNeed I say more? This entire review has been about how great this show is and how much I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime is very very much enjoyable, but it probably is not suited for people who don't like randomness anime, who'd rather be able to tell what's going to happen next. This is personal preference, and as a person who watches a lot of such animes filled with randomness, I have to say it's one of the best such animes I've watched.",

            "content": "When I first finished this anime, I gave it 8. But I wasn't entirely honest with myself. This anime is possibly the anime I've subjectively enjoyed the most. As a pure episodic comedy, it won't be as deep as Erog Proxy or other mature anime, and there was my mistake: I was trying to compare a comedy to dark toned artsy series with deep plots. Then I raised the number to 9, thinking it had some shortcomings, but today after I yet again rewatched some of my favourite scenes I decided to give it a straght 10 and write a review. For me, Nichijou representsthe pinnacle of comedy par none. This is just so good.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Nichijou so special? It is hard to pick any single factor, since the wholeness is constructed out of small pieces which overlap flawlessly. The art style is extremely good for Nichijou. It's colourful yet edgy & plain, granting the characters adequate space for conveying the subtlest comedic effects. The character expressions and body language are simply priceless. This effect is then enhanced by the awesome seiyuus who really breathe life into their characters with unique voice talents - all of the characters have their own speech quirks, speech patterns and tones. It gets never monotonous with Nichijou! Every character then has own distinct personality, enhanced by their expressions, body language and seiyuus. Every single one of them has something slightly off normal. The characters resulting from this kind of build where all the bases are well covered are pure diamond, and they really drive the jokes forward at a break-neck speed. \\n\r\nDespite Nichijou being mostly about cheap Monty Python -esque flood of gags, the jokes work so well because the characters are so well designed & performing. This doesn't only apply to the main characters, but extends to the plethora of supporting acts as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe only weakness Nichijou has as a comedy are some of the recurring jokes and some really high-flying extended jokes which only manage to create a humongous what-the-hell-did-I-just-see-what-is-this-I-don't-even inside viewers head. Some sketches are also aimed on pure \"cute\" side of the scale instead of the \"humour\". However, I've concluded this variety is actually a good thing: it actually makes the pacing better and gives the viewer some time to breathe between extremely hard-hitting jokes. Mony Python's Flying Circus which now comes second on my list of all-time best comedies failed at this. Just try marathoning it and you'll notice you are a bit numb after just two or three episodes. This doesn't happen with Nichijou. \\n\\n\r\nI can't praise this anime enough. It simply has to be experienced, as words are not enough. You can't ever explain perfectly what makes things funny and others may not share your idea of \"fun\", but I'm rather certain that everyone can find something to enjoy in Nichijou.",

            "content": "Being a KyoAni project, the first thought that came into my mind when I saw the cover art for Nichijou was that it is going to be a comedy/slice of life filled with cute girls doing cute things. Luckily, there's much more to this anime. Nichijou is a sketch comedy, with a sprinkle of slice of life, set in a junior high school. While the title in English is \"My Ordinary Life\", Nichijou is full of the extraordinary. \r\nThere are two main plot threads going on throughout Nichijou. The first follows the trio of Yuuko, Mio and Mai as they try to get through theyear at school. The second follows the Professor, her cat, Sakamoto and her robot, Nano as they attempt to run a working household together. Alone, these stories are enough to carry the series. However, this is a sketch comedy with recurring characters. A feature of sketch comedies with recurring characters is that each character gets their own story. Hence, Nichijou manages to have many short stories throughout the series involving many of the side characters in addition to the main ones. This means that, unlike what most people say, Nichijou has a lot more plot than people realise.\\n\\n\r\nUpon initial viewing, it takes a while to get accustomed to the style of comedy. However, after being acclimatised to the randomness and energetic scenes, the show will become enjoyable. Of course, comedy is going to be reliant on one's sense of humour, so if this isn't down your alley, then it won't work. But for the majority of people most sketches in this show will hit the mark and have everyone laughing. The sketches themselves are mostly based around usual occurrences at schools, for example, forgetting one's homework or having a crush on a guy. However, Nichijou is also willing to go to the extraordinary with situations like the school principal fighting a deer or the \"tsundere\" trope being taken to the extreme where she uses missile launchers instead of the usual \"B-BAKA!\". By setting the tone early, this series manages to not only feel like these sketches belong together, but the stories themselves intertwine as each episode progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe technical aspects of the show help sell the comedy. The animation flows extremely well, which is quite surprising for a comedy, but it allows for the slapstick scenes to be as high octane as the creators want it to be. There isn't much of a soundtrack to the show, however the sound effects add to each scene well. One of the drawbacks is that each character's design is quite similar, especially for the girls. Almost all of them have the same body shape and face, where the only differences are the hair style. Also what can be a negative is when the girls get into shouting matches that their high pitched voices can be quite intense.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the best part of Nichijou is the world it creates. The characters and setting are fleshed out well and feel like a real place; even with the bizarre events that occur frequently. The show isn't just all comedy; there are many touching moments throughout which helps one empathise and connect with the characters while perhaps teaching a few lessons on being a good friend. That's not to say it's a tearjerker, but it will remind viewers of the troubles they went through in high school and how they dealt with it. However, the show's message is quite basic; friendship can make everything fun and can help people get through difficult times.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this show for everyone who enjoys lighthearted anime, but it must be noted that one's sense of humour must be considered first before deciding whether to watch the show. For people that do enjoy a comedy set in a high school and full of energy, Nichijou is a must watch. Now I join the many fans who are hoping for a second season.",

It's had very limited releases outside of Japan with the North American versions even being canceled for reasons I don't know. The question is, were audiences thankfully spared or are they missing out on something? I'm going to examine the anime to find out.\r\nThis is yet another comedy without an over-arching story. The episodes do have a definite order, however. The setting is that a bunch of characters live their ordinary lives. It's mostly about high school girls but there are some teachers, animals and other assorted characters as well. Now for the all importantquestion: is it funny? The answer is on occasion. A lot of the humour just relies on complete randomness. And it's not randomness that leads to an amusing moment most of the time. It's just something completely random happening, like a vending machine not working properly. Sometimes it's funny but it's usually just something stupid that leaves you waiting for a nonexistent punch-line. The non-random humour is generally very predictable and a lot of jokes get repeated.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of the characters is really too big. As a result most of them are used for one or two jokes. There are maybe six core characters who get involved with more than that and they're still pretty bland.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is boring. The technique shifts pretty frequently and none of it is particularly good. Noses are largely absent and animals barely resemble what they're supposed to be in most cases. It's passable, but it's not decent.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting isn't bad. The cast does a fine job, nothing spectacular but it's fine. One issue that I do have with the voice acting is that there are several loud tirades that just feel like pointless noise. Because shouting for about five minutes straight is funny? No, it's just annoying. Speaking of annoying, a lot of the music in this is badly sung and just obnoxious. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 2/10. There are a couple moments that border on homoerotic but there aren't many and they never go anywhere. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Nichijou is a 3/10. There are a few funny moments but it's mostly just loud and boring. If you think that random=funny you'll probably find it hilarious. Otherwise, I would stay away from it.",

            "content": "Nichijou means \"Everyday Normal (Life)\", and this anime is nothing close to that.\r\nAre drugs illegal in your country? Well, most likely they are. But assume that you had access to all of them, then you bought one of each kind, and then you mixed them all in one big pot, and then you drunk a spoon of that drug-soup. The final effect? Something close to Nichijou.\r\nYou'll be living with a state of mind, where you imagine you're living in reality and experiencing all kinds of daily life, but actually you're lying on the floor and staring at the ceiling, yet you don't realize it. That'show it feels to watch Nichijou. For someone sane like me this anime is nonsense from beginning to end, but if you're drugged enough you'll call it slice-of-life or something like that.\\n\\n\r\nExamples? Too many too mention - pretty much everything. Just watch one episode, and you'll understand.\\n\\n\r\nGenre - Comedy. Where?\\n\\n\r\nSome people claim it's funny. Are talking cats funny? Is it fun to watch a retarded kid talk sloooooowly. Is it fun to see a clumsy girl forgot her homework? Or is it funny to see someone suddenly take out a bazooka from out-of-nowhere and shoot at their friends? If you find those things funny, then you really need to check out 9gag, and if you still continue finding Nichijou funny, check yourself with a local psychiatrist. More than likely they'll successfully diagnose you with some disorder.\\n\\n\r\nRelaxing? More like headache-inducing!\\n\\n\r\nThe so-called-humor is so over-the-limit that it's not funny. It's either pitiful to watch or disgusting or simply boring. Technically, it gives you a headache if you watch it for long enough. In the whole period of 26 episodes I haven't laughed even once, but after 26 episodes I'm close to puking.\\n\\n\r\nCreative?\\n\\n\r\nYes, I haven't seen anything as creative as this since 2girls1cup! The abnormality is over-the-top and I have to agree, I wouldn't be able to come up with so much b.s. no matter how long I would spend thinking.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nIf you find a group of druggies in the back-alley somewhere, then I bet you it's gonna be exactly the same atmosphere. The characters of Nichijou are really not much different from druggies. Their personalities are unrealistic, and don't occur in real life unless you make someone take a bunch of drugs.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nPossibly the only thing acceptable about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding Recommendations:\\n\r\nDanshi Koukousei no Nichijou - this one stays in the realm of reality, while Nichijou flies to the planet of druggies.\\n\r\nAzumanga Daioh - very similar, but Azumanga had better characters.\\n\r\nLucky Star - this was at least funny, Nichijou lacks any humor what-so-ever.\\n\r\nSchool Rumble - similarly unrealistic, but School Rumble was a bit more funny.\\n\r\nSayonara Zetsubou Sensei - this is a parody of all kinds of characters, nothing in common with Nichijou.\\n\r\nNisemonogatari - someone took too many drugs and added this completely unrelated series as a recommendation.\\n\r\nArakawa Under the Bridge - this is a story from the land of dreams, not the land of drugs! Don't mix up the two!\\n\r\nGintama - how can you compare a masterpiece like Gintama to a crap like Nichijou?\\n\\n\r\nI'll finish here, in the end I was only pissed off about seeing Gintama as a recommendation... \\n\\n\r\nFinal Question:\\n\r\nWhy did I rate it as 1/10?\\n\\n\r\nBecause my limited brain is slowly running out of space for watching crap, and every 100 anime or so my scoring gets harsher and harsher, and I was going to score this as 2/10, but then I'm a cat lover, and I don't have enough fingers to count all the scenes that involve physical abuse of a poor Sakamoto (the cat).\\n\\n\r\nSome people find animal abuse funny, especially when they're on drugs, so I'm not surprised that the \"humor\" of this anime revolves around this kind of \"fun\".\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, previous sentence is also a very good one-sentence summary of the whole anime.",

            "content": "This review will be hard to write, as I will probably laugh at certain parts.\r\nStory: 8\r\nSo... Nichijou isn't much of a story, rather a collection of short stories, a bunch of them.  These short stories are divided based on the characters. In the beginning we have mainly separate stories all happening around the same time, but are not interconnected.  I found this a bit boring, just a collection of stories with characters who had no idea the other characters of the anime existed.  Towards the end though, the stories become interconnect as the characters meet each other. These episodes were more interesting,seeing the stories all fitting together.   \\n\r\nThe only parts I didn't really enjoy were the Helvetica Standard, the humor was to weird or didn't have enough context for it to be funny (At least to me)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art of Nichijou at first glance is very simplistic, but as you watch more episodes, you will notice the different art styles used in Nichijou.  Nichijou covers a multitude of genres, with the art matching whatever genre the short story is about.  The art and animation for scenes such as Mio losing it or Mai and Yuuko playing coin soccer are some of the best art. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nBoth OPs are very catchy and addicting to listen to.  The first ED was really good as well, but I found the other 6 EDs used during the second half of the series not as enjoyable.  The background music was nice, with a few added to my music playlist.  The background music help set the mood for each short story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nCharacters were all enjoyable, with very unique roles.  My favorite being Nano, as she is a very mature character with a bunch of moe.  Maturity and moe?  What.  The only problem was character development, there is none, but it doesn't matter much in an anime like this.  Misato taking Tsundere to another level as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nBoy I wish I could rate this higher, I enjoyed this anime so much.  There so many parts in where I: questioned what happen, laughed hysterically, and stared blankly as I was speechless.  These all kept my attention and was very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nOne of the best if not the best comedies I have seen, in where I will definitely rewatch.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm going to start out by saying this my favourite anime. It has made me laugh when I did not have the energy to talk, it has let me escape reality when I did not want to exist. Whenever I try looking for comedy anime similar, common recommendations like Lucky Star and Azumanga Daioh appear a lot. Danshi Koukousei comes close, but Nichijou is an experience that outshines all of these by quite a margin. There is really no definitive genre to put this show in other than comedy, it is almost the epitome of it, because that's all it is: simple pure ecstasy. \r\nEnjoyment:\r\nItexplores humour in ways I could not begin to imagine. For the most part, Nichijou uses the \"traditional\" anime gag style of comedy. This efficiency of this method has always befuddled me because it exploits the core of why humans find things funny (the unexpected action), but follows it up by breaking the golden rule of comedy (explaining/calling out the joke). Then this anime takes this already uniquely unprecedented brand of humour and blasts it at full volume, and even the tsukkomi becomes the joke. So the natural conclusion was that Nichijou's funniness comes for its major amplification of gag humour to the point where every single punchline just jumps at you. Yet, rewatching it for the third time still held up as well, if not better, than the first time. Perhaps it is the amazing voice acting, after all, one could make an entire soundboard out of the sounds these characters make. Then the series throws a fastball at me with an entire skit completely without speech, which is just as funny as every other skit. Well-paced, well-executed, Nichijou's comedy is done to a t in every technical aspect, and downright hysterical in practical implementation. And all while  being astoundingly comical, it is, at all the right places, beautifully heart-warming, more so in the second half (see: Episode 26), with a deep message of positivity and optimism.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, amazing. Moe stylings mixed with grand production value, breathtaking backgrounds and effects, fluid animation that competes with Madhouse's sakuga and makes 2D animation look like it was rendered straight from Maya, so amazingly capture the essence of the series it could bring a tear to my eye. It is unlike KyoAni's usual work, yet, weirdly, I feel only they could've pulled off Arawi Keiichi brilliant vision and absurd hilarity.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAll music was perfect in their usage \u2013 from the background compositions that carry along the slice of life and school anime feel, to the memorable sounds used for recurring sections, and that one time they used an emotional vocalised song during a ridiculous skit of Mio training for high jump. Another thing that captured my attention was the sound design and engineering. As mentioned before, the voice acting is riotously done, but how they time it and fit it with the music and visuals, adding effects and certain points, most notably when they repeat screams in succession, is brilliant. As for the openings and endings, Hyadain was a flawless choice, with his upbeat, well-produced and cheerful sound, much like the show itself, while Sayaka Sasaki's calm and melodious vocals add to that heart-warming factor. The choice to change ending songs every episode for the second half was also bold and very fitting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI could rant on and on about the cast. Every single character is remarkably unique and enjoyable to watch, every single one, secondary or tertiary. And oddly, in a world where unexplainably random and outlandish events are occurring, they are to an extent, believable. In the way that they are not stuck with a singular trait, they each have quirks that stray from their definitive role, and switch up their position between interactions. This is perhaps why I enjoyed it more rewatching it. Understandably, with so much happening to so many people at an unbelievable pace, especially for people used to, frankly, normal anime, it is difficult to connect with the characters early on the first time around. It is even more fun watching them act when you already know and love them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt is simply a show created to make you smile, no matter the situation. And it succeeds. I understand why some people might not like it, but I am absolutely, unequivocally in love with this anime.",

            "content": "(9.0/10) \r\n______________________________________________________________\r\nNostalgia is a powerful thing. You can look back at the past with rose-tinted glasses and see a world that felt brighter and happier than it may have been. A world that sparkles, cascading happiness, rather than limping along like a wounded animal.\r\nThis wistful affection for the past is what makes the now so hopeful, in a way, because you know you can look back at it for years to come and perhaps remember something differently. Whether it's good or bad, you look back knowing more, being smarter, and understanding the situations and why you were in them.  \r\nThis feeling permeates throughout Nichijou;a plucky, goofy show that has a thumping heart full of joy, a heart full of living in the now, a heart that it wears on its sleeve. It's a beautiful series, really, one that started off as a funny look into the lives of three girls who became friends due to circumstance. As well as their detours and the characters that happen to encapsulate the screen at the time. \\n\\n\r\nThe series, however, sprouted into something else. It became a nostalgic trip of relate-able situations and inspiring commentary interspersed with scenic shots of everyday life. It's amazing. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[STORY / CHARACTERS] \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the show you are introduced to various, equally adorable characters that exist in this unique universe. Each one harboring enough quirks to plug a wine cellar. \\n\\n\r\nThe shows structure serves these characters, too. For the first thirteen episodes, Nichijou's structure is incredibly loose or flat-out non-existent. There really isn't much tying any scene together, and that's what initially caught my attention. This show was virtually skit after skit. What actually surprised me, however, was just how funny it is. The idea of blowing up an everyday occurrence (forgetting homework, for example) to this big, insane situation isn't an original idea, however, what the show does have going for it is Kyoto Animation's animation. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this show's comedic styling is reminiscent of most anime comedy, which I dislike, in the sense that it's very \"reactionary\", as I call it. Where the punchline, usually, is a character's reaction to a situation. The show does do well with creating some more unique setups, but it also shines with, as I said, the animation. \\n\\n\r\nKyoAni pretty much nailed it here. The show is really pretty to look at. The director's deft shot composition plus the various changes in style that a certain scene may go through shows a great understanding of comedic visuals. Fairly often, the show would completely change style to delivery a scene better. Whether it's washing out the colors, going for hyper-realism, or going for flat-out surrealism. It almost always created an interesting scene to look at. This style segmented with skits of hyper action animation have the show skirt the line between exhilaration and intensity. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni's animation isn't the only thing that shines though. The Characters, and in turn, their VA's, are some of the best I've ever heard in anime. Specifically, the jaw-droppingly adorable professor Hakase, whom was voice acted by Konno Hiromi, was a pleasure to watch (and hear). The character herself was great, mainly because she was one of the most realistic, yet equally unrealistic kid-characters I've seen in quite a while.\\n\\n\r\nShe's a genius engineer that also acts like a little kid. By acts like a little kid I don't mean \"is\" a little kid, while obviously she is. Many shows often skirt their kid characters into two groups. Obnoxious annoyance and adorable cuteness. There really isn't a mix, because honestly, that's what a real kid is like; a mix. Hakase has her moments of utter obnoxiousness but those are floating in a stew of delightfully cute character moments that are very reminiscent of an actual kid, rather than what a writer might think a kid would act like. Hakase is separate from the main cast of three girls though. She generally inhabits her laboratory/house with her robot caretaker Nano and talking cat, Sakamoto. This keeps the structure loose and the situations constantly varied. \\n\\n\r\nThe second standout is Yuuko, voiced by Honda Mariko, who absolutely blew me away. Her comedic voice work is spectacular. Her voice, like, the actual sound of her voice is perfect for comedy. The amount of times Yuuko's entire cadence,pitch,tone changes is a marvel to listen to. Her voice is amazing for her role as the forgetful, ditsy, yet oddly passionate Yuuko. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, every character really gets his or her time to shine. With a cast of really rich and vibrant secondaries that honestly have some of the shows best moments. KyoAni's animation and style is also to blame for this shows likableness. The character designs and general aesthetic is so enjoyable to look at. Each character is very malleable and just looks great for the role that they were given. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nThis show does have a transition midway through its run. It's not major, but it made me go from very much enjoying it to falling in love with it. Hitting the midway point, the theme-song changes from something that's kind of random and goofy (with lyrics about love) to something a bit more... emotionally resonant and thematic? Although it's still equally endearing and fun, much like the show, it actually fits the show's motif now too. \\n\\n\r\nLyrics about friendship, being there when your friend is down, showing them that they aren't alone are all included in this new intro. These themes are prevalent throughout the show, especially the second half, where a character that was pretty separate in terms of skits from the three main girls decides to go to their school.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where friendships begin to form and a whole new, surprisingly subtle, commentary about imperfections and acceptance are made. The structure is tightened ever so slightly so now episodes are more focused on an overarching, yet very slight narrative. \\n\\n\r\nTalking about the narrative, it's surprisingly well crafted for a show that really didn't need to have it well crafted. The narrative structure is more reminiscent to the Monogatari series rather than something like Toradora. This fractured narrative is actually quite interesting, as some scenes in episodes feel disorganized but come together towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nThese rapid-fire comedy scenes with a small narrative are split by these beautiful scenic shots of life. Whether it's the train-tracks or just an elevator, Nichijou cuts to these scenes maybe three or four times per episode, showing you what everyday people are up to. It's kind of beautiful and understated.\\n\\n\r\nThis understated nature continues with some of the shows delivery of skits. Every episode continues a few running gags from previous installments and has these comic-like shorts within the episode. These shorts are usually, well... short, but generally very quiet and cute as well. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nWhile the comedy in the show is almost always relate-able, some of it does get lost in translation; literally. A lot of the shows humor is very cultural, which is fine, but it makes some of the puns very tough to understand. I had to do some external research if I wanted to understand everything in the show. \\n\\n\r\nThat's not a bad thing, however, it does impede enjoyment when i'm left high and dry on a joke due to it being strictly cultural. But even these cultural jokes make sense in context, with you understanding the connotation for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what makes Nichijou such a joy to watch as a show. I found myself remembering back to similar situations, which may have occurred different culturally, but had similar effects. For example, going into a test and being presented with a problem on it that has art associated with it. This art is fucking confusing and you're left pondering what the art may be rather than the actual problem. This connected with just how fast time seems to fly when you are taking a test makes for some hilarious commentary and nostalgia-filled views on high-school life. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND]\\n\\n\r\nAs I've mentioned, the show has a pretty enjoyable soundtrack with some strong musical stings. Much like a lot of anime, these stings are repeated constantly and if you don't grow to like them then they'll soon begin to annoy the ever living fuck out of you.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully the stings in Nichijou are appealing to me. The music in the show helps tell it's many stories. The lively experiences that exude a memorable quality about them.\\n\\n\r\nBoth openings are actually not too bad, and I usually hate Jpop anime openings. Specifically the second one is downright addicting and really captures the shows vibe. I found myself actually watching the openings, which I usually skip in most other shows. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\n[STORY / CHARACTERS] - Part 2\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you can't tell, there's a lot to talk about when it comes to the shows themes and storytelling. A lot of the joy these girls (and boys) experience in their day-to-day life goes from being cute, charming, and funny to being downright inspirational. A simple skit on pole-vaulting turns into something that's over-the-top and crazy, but also something that's undoubtedly full of heart. You buy into this world, and that's what makes it so special. \\n\\n\r\nNichijou also has some very strong comedic pauses, as they try to let certain jokes breath which is honestly a breath of fresh air. It is also mandatory for a series like this to do it because often times the jokes do run long, and if you don't like the joke you'll find yourself really zoning out. These thankful pauses create some of the shows most memorable and fun sequences.\\n\\n\r\nWith KyoAni shining brightly with the animation, most of the shows most incredible (and rewatchable) sequences are also the ones that have an immense amount of sakuga, or moments where the animation improves drastically and becomes something incredible. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nAs I've said, themes of togetherness and friendship ring close to home for me. This show encapsulates that and delivers some incredibly sappy, yet also  stunningly heartwarming sequences that, I won't lie, definitely got me emotional... and i'm strictly a non-emotion having watcher of just about any show. \\n\\n\r\nNichijou is very honest with it's emotions too, it wears them on it's sleeve. It smartly avoids melodrama for most of it's run-time, which means that just about every aspect of this show is devoid of the every day boring drama that you'd watch a romcom for. So when it does deliver some melodrama towards the end, it's easier to buy and swallow.\\n\\n\r\nThe romantic elements are also mostly played for laughs, which is a welcome break from \"we have to pair these characters together!\" Certain characters which pine over the same person never really meet or discuss and no boring love-triangle is formed. It's the little choices this show makes to become extra-love able in my eyes. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\\n\r\nNichijou is damn near perfect. It loves life, and it makes you love life too. It's a show about friendship and togetherness in an incredibly cute style with some standout animation and direction from the Kyoto Animation team. When the show does get sappy, it's the kind of sappy that you buy because at that point you love these characters and love seeing them interact and live on screen.\\n\\n\r\nIt breaths life. The scenic shots of the city, the homey comic skits, the over-the-top reactions to certain situations. This show is not only funny, it's smart in it's delivery and setting. It truly is something special. Nichijou is about friends. It's about imperfections. It's about being together. There's nothing that surprised me more than this. I didn't expect to watch a show fitting the holidays so much. I'm eager to watch it again. \\n\\n\r\nAs I wrapped up my viewing at four AM last night, I sat up in my bed and wiped whatever was struggling to come out of my eye. I thought about my experience with this show and what I feel like I got out of it. I opened my eyes the next day and life was just a little more interesting. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Nichijou: My Ordinary Review\r\nNichijou, aka. My Ordinary Life is quite a contradiction. This anime is far from ordinary and the best way I can describe it is pure insanity. In fact, this anime is so insane that it is actually quite ingenious. \r\nThe story of Nichijou is pretty simple. It's split up between the somewhat bizarre every day happenings of three high school girls (Yuuko, Mio, and Mai) in one half of the story and the comical struggles of a robotic girl having to take care of her child professor and talking cat (Nano, Hakase, and Sakamoto). While a majority of the anime focuses aroundthese six characters, there are quite a few short segments that focus in the supporting characters and in most cases, these segments will happen randomly within the narrative. Usually I'm not a big fan of when side story interrupts a flowing narrative, but in this case, it works. The main narrative isn't necessary deep and focuses MUCH more on comedy than storytelling. Nichijou's setup is best described much like an episode of Monty Python. It's made up of a bunch of sketches that somehow make up about a half-hour of hilarity at a time. Although, unlike Monty Python, Nichijou does actually have a narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork I'd say is decent. The animation itself isn't stunning in graphical nature. However, what it lacks in flashiness, it makes up in creativity. How this series is animated is perfect for the nature of this series. It's cartoonishly comical in it's animation and it's just what the doctor ordered for this series. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, the opening and ending sequences are just gorgeous. The opening sequences for both the first half and second half set the mood perfectly. When you see the opening, you know you're in for a crazy, comical, and downright wild ride from start to finish. What I found interesting though was the ending sequence. I actually thought ZZZ was one of the better anime endings I have ever seen with its joyful and downright artistic feel. It feels almost as if you're watching the dream sequence of a young child. While I can't necessarily say it \"fits\" the anime, what I can say is despite that, the concept was certainly brilliant and kudos to the production team that put it together.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was downright spectacular. This is one of the few animes I've ever watched where I didn't feel like a single character was miscast. One rather unique concept this anime picked up was for the previews, they'd take a random object from the episode, give it its own personality and voice over from guest stars. I was amazed at some of the star power they were even able to pick up, including Aya Hirano, Yui Horie, and Tomokazu Seki just to name a few. The passion that was put behind the voice acting in this series was just incredible to see in action, from the major roles to even the smallest of minor roles.\\n\\n\r\nOf all the things that made this anime click, I felt the characters were the strongest. The main characters were certainly interesting to watch. You had Yuuko the clumsy, dumbstruck girl with a fun personality, Mio the incredibly obsessive, short tempered, but forgiving girl and Mai, the quiet oddball that seems more concerned with her own world than others around her. The other side of the main cast was great as well. You had Nano the self-conscious, yet dutiful robotic girl that serves as the caretaker for Hakase, an extremely intelligent, yet childish scientist, and Sakamoto, a stray cat that's taken in by them and gains the ability to talk by wearing a scarf. The main characters were great and I can tell you the supporting characters were just as fantastic. I rolled in laughter just about any time Sasahara appeared with his wealthy and poetic mannerisms or when Takahashi-sensei embarrassingly obsessed over Sakurai-sensei. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing I really didn't like about Nichijou as a series, it would be how it ended. I found the final episode to be rather weak for a series finale. I could tell that the writers were really hoping to keep this going with a second season but was unfortunately discontinued due to poor sales. It really is such a shame because I felt the plot itself for the most part wasn't bad and there were open ends to many of the characters side stories. It did a pretty good job of rapping up Nano's story and perhaps Mio's as well (although that one is open for debate). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're looking for an anime that's chaotically hilarious, you can find none better than Nichijou. The creativity behind Nichijou is purely astounding and I'd even go so far to say that this is perhaps the best comedy series I have ever seen. What it did surprisingly well was advertise itself as a pure comedy but somehow implemented surprising slice-of-life elements where you wouldn't expect them. While I did watch this series for laughs, I found myself enjoying each character's on-going narrative and was invested in their outcomes. All-in-all, Nichijou's comedy might not be for everyone. However, I am willing to bet even the stiffest of stiffs would find something to chuckle at in this series.",

            "content": "Nichijou is a one-of-a-kind anime that exists not only to represent everyday life, but a wide array of social, emotional, relate-able, and some times down right daft modern day plights. As a generalization for anyone who can't be asked to read all of this: Nichijou is a bold, up-beat, masterfully crafted, immensely funny, refreshing; cartoon-esc take on modern day life. It breaks through the typical barriers of the SoL genre and breathes new life into the term \"ordinary\" - \r\nAs you will find out, if you watch: Nichijou is quite far fetched at times; as it seamlessly makes instant transitions from extremely dramatic, to extremelycomedic, and maybe even to sad - all the drop of a hat!\\n\r\nRendering it FAR from just, \"ordinary life\": which is probably what you expected when you came here.\\n\\n\r\nSo! All in favor of a SliceOLife/Action/Romance/Comedy/Adventure/Drama/Fantasy/Moe/SciFi..... -The list goes on forever and so that's likely why it's packaged so deceivingly as a stereotypical SoL.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou doesn't major in a strung out, perplexing story line. Therefore rendering it as an episodic show for the most part, which works wonders for the vibrant, and somewhat abstract presentation method it utilizes so well: compiling countless, effectively crafted, short-story scenes that keep the viewer engaged, on top of encompassing a massive spread of genres as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of presentation, Nichijou emphasizes in an action and cartoon-like manor: a variety of cliche anime techniques, often for the purpose of looking ridiculous. Thus making everything very engaging, and appealing to people of all ages. If i were to name this approach, it would definitely be \"OTT\" (over the top) - which, if you understand what i'm getting at here, should give you an idea of how it comes across as such a hilarious show.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of comedy, i'm not joking (get it), It's great  how the show makes use of so much effective (primarily) slapstick material; without detracting ATALL from the characters and atmosphere. As a pre-warning, don't watch unless you're free to laugh out loud wherever you may be ;)\\n\\n\r\nStatistic related stuff now (yay of course)...\\n\r\nFor both Art and Sound, i see No flaws - as the animation style is adaptive and makes great use of current situation, in turn, greatly helping to enhance the way in which the show conveys feelings. While the use of sound is always appropriate in similar ways. \\n\r\nNote: I think the intro sequences are Top Notch!\\n\\n\r\nAs you should already be aware, i can't exactly mark extraordinarily in terms of story or development detail, as it's not THAT kind of show, which is a blessing really, having enjoyed all of it myself.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude... The craftsmanship, the abstract presentation, story concepts, comedy all equate to... and i can't stress it enough here: a brilliantly entertaining, laid back show like None I've ever seen before. \\n\r\nSo i ask EVEN of those who dislike SoLs to give it a go, as, again: it may as well have a genre of its own. \\n",

            "content": "Nichijou is a slice of life comedy that was produced by Kyoto Animation, the company behind the production of very popular shows in the same genre - such as K-ON! and Lucky Star - but also other works like Clannad (in conjunction with Key), and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzymiya. That said, all of these shows had some sort of genius behind them, and Nichijou is the same way. \r\n*Very minor character spoilers in the paragraph below - nothing really detrimental to the story in my opinion* \r\nNichijou's cast is quite lovable to say the least. The show is initially divided into three groups.\r\nThe firstis the Shinonome Laboratory group, consisting of Hakase Shinonome (a really cute but attention seeking kid-professor), her robot, Nano Shinonome (who ultimately wants to be like an ordinary teenaged girl), and their cat (a cat who talks due to one of Hakase's inventions; tries to be mature).\\n\\n\r\nThe second is composed of three really awesome friends in high school: Yuuko (a somewhat stupid girl with some really stupid logic, but has some good things going for her), Mio (practically the opposite of Yuuko [complimentary], but shares some of Yuulo's flaws as well), and Mai (Nichijou's resident troll ; practically the catalyst for many of the skits and jokes).\\n\\n\r\nThe third is a wide array of side characters, such as Tachibana Misato (Nichijou's resident Tsundere, who, somehow, has many rocket launchers, turrents, and a P90 at her disposal), her crush, Sasahara Koujirou (a character that sorta comes off as a douchebag but has some redeeming undertones to his personality), Sakurai Izumi (a shy, reserved homeroom teacher who is naturally a pushover), and Manabu Takasaki (a teacher that crushes on Sakurai, but epicly fails during encounters he has with her).\\n\\n\r\nWhile this may seem like a lot of characters to get a grasp of, you are given an 'almost equal' taste (in the way of skits) of each group in every single episode and in no particular order. (I do say 'almost equal' because the story tends to favor the first two groups more - this makes sense since the third group are considered supporting roles, but I feel that their roles in the show go way past the expectations of supporting roles.) In watching how they carry out their lives, express themselves, interacting with each other, by the end of the series, you'll have a great feel for the characters and the roles their friends play in their lives. One of the major themes in Nichijou is friendship, which the story does a good job showing us. You will find that Nichijou has some serious, heartwarming moments that not only compliment the feel of the show, but also the feel for each of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nSlice of life comedies put a lot of emphasis on humor rather than plot, which is where the genre gets lost for some. Nichijou, while not necessarily plot driven, does contain a more concrete story in the second half of the series. In fact, while we're only given a little bit of plot, it does not feel 'half-assed' in any way as it does drive many of the skits along, and it also helps put a really nice and sweet ending to the show (though some may argue that it was a bit underwhelming).\\n\\n\r\nI do feel like it is worth mention that Nichijou sorta reserves the right to gets away with it's minimal plot as the literal translation for the name 'Nichijou' in English is 'Ordinary Life,' or more colloquially, 'Everyday Life'. That is what this show does, depict the everyday life of the cast - nothing more, nothing less. Adding all these thoughts up, I think Nichijou met my expectations content wise.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Nichijou looks a bit different, but who says that's a bad thing. It is important to note that Nichijou's designs are almost completely taken from the manga it originated from. That said, while it may not feature the most favorable designs, it does make sense for the show in that it helps convey the same feel as the original, intended work.\\n\\n\r\nThis 'animated comic book' like feel, in my opinion, compliments the type of story Nichijou actually is - its light, fun, not meant to be taken seriously - and adds to the whole mindset that anything can happen in the show. That said, Kyoto Animation really out did themselves with the animation and production quality of this show.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou is fitted with all sorts of skits. For one, you have these really simple interactions between the characters. Animation on these, as expected, is practically flawless. However, a large part of Nichijou's claim to fame is due in part to its very overdramatic, hyper, overproduced, but ridiculously hilarious slapstick skits. Quite literally, you'll get all of these epic 3D camera movements, and epic, vivid explosions on many occasions - often for stupid things (for example, saving a piece of food from hitting the floor). Not only that, but its fits shockingly well with the comic art style. This is where I, as well as many other people agree that KyoAni did all of this random stuff, not because it was necessary, but because they simply can. Actually, some may even go as far as saying that KyoAni decided to play the mad scientist and made stuff happen just for the hell of it. I really cannot stress enough that all of the art, this included, contributes greatly to the overall comedic execution within Nichijou. For that, I really praise KyoAni for their work on this. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of comedy, I feel that Nichijou is one of the funniest shows I've seen yet, however, it is not all that perfect. There are going to be times when the jokes end up flying over your head and make you wonder whether or not the particular skit was supposed to make you laugh or not. This should not deter you from watching though. I cannot stress enough that the vast majority of the jokes will have you ROFLing, as Nichijou's execution is top notch (some may say one of the best in the business), particularly in timing -after all, it is everything - and the ordering of the skits in particular episodes (hell, at some point you may see a funny skit cross an episode, which was a pretty hilarious surprise in my opinion). In fact, it can be pretty safe to say that this show has ways to surprise you with jokes, which definitely can definitely keep you watching.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I don't want to go on about the music (I'm going to totally omit talking abou the BGM), the two OPs the show has to offer are both crazy earworms. I personally love them as the hyper feel compliments the show very well. Additionally, I love the how KyoAni sequenced both OPs together with awesome pans and editing. I don't remember loving a sequence this much since Lucky Star's OP and the very popular Hare Hare Yukai ED from THAT other KyoAni work. If there is anything a reader will pick on, it is this portion (opinions are opinions), so I'll end the music talk here.\\n\\n\r\nIf you could not tell from, what I think is, the overwhelming amounts of praise from the paragraphs above, I really enjoyed Nichijou. Truth is, I really love slice of life shows. The fact that they are not plot driven, fun, and entertaining makes it my 'go-to' genre when I don't have the time to watch plot heavy shows - especially with this being my senior year in high school. Fact of the matter is that Nichijou is my favorite slice show at the moment, mainly because it can act as a pick-me-up and/or aid in procrastination with the random skits it has, but I can also choose to focus on the minor plot if I really want to watch something with a little more substance. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I find it sad that this show flopped in Japan. While it seems popular here on MAL, Nichijou got knocked off it's primetime slot mid-series, and missed its sales quota in Japan by a lot (it sold less than 2,000 Blu-Ray and DVDs). Ultimately, this kills all chances for a second season, which I and many others would have liked to see. Many attribute Nichijou's failure to the fact that it was not produced to market to the masses - something K-ON did with it's moe-style feel and practically was a smash hit.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know the truth behind KyoAni and Nichijou, but it seems as if they created a masterpiece, if not something close, and did it without thinking about catering to the mainstream - did it for the sake of creating something awesome, not for the sake of profit. Maybe its just me wanting to justify KyoAni's failure, but either way, the fact that the intended market left Nichijou unappreciated just doesn't sit well for me. This show is awesome to say the least, and I do wish it would catch on in Japan. But it is what it is I guess.\\n\\n\r\nScoring:\\n\\n\r\nStory & Plot: 7.5 -> 8\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 9.5/10 -> 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10 -> 10\\n\\n\r\nComedy: 9\\n\\n\r\nAverage: 9.2 (I'll give it a ten for my own reasons, but I won't object to people giving it 9's)\\n\\n\r\nI'd just like to note that this is the first time I'll be reviewing a series on this site. I'd appreciate it if any readers out there could give me feedback on this review as it would be extremely helpful for whenever I decide to make another review in the future. Additionally, this review will not contain any major spoilers, however, I do feel like the review will lack a bit without them. Again, any wisdom on this would be highly appreciated. Thanks.",

            "content": "Within the Slice-of-Life genre, it\u2019s no surprise to see a cast of characters doing mundane things, going about their \u2018ordinary\u2019 daily lives while trying their best to be cute at it. Now what if we took the exact same formula but pulled the \u2018ordinary\u2019 right out of it, leaving not even a speck of it behind and blended the remains with some of the most ridiculous ideas and scenarios that one could think of. The result wouldn\u2019t be too far from the Anime known as \u2018Nichijou\u2019.\r\n===Story===\r\nThis aspect is a bit difficult to consider when it comes to Nichijou, because the show doesn\u2019t really follow anykind of plot line. There are some developments made here and there that stick throughout the show and are referenced later on, but it\u2019s nothing major enough to be considered as an actual plot line. So then, does that make it a bad show? Of course not! Simply put, Nichijou offers the setting of a certain town and presents a number of different scenarios within each episode that center around a few different groups of characters. As for the nature of these scenarios\u2026 They\u2019re seemingly things that you\u2019d face in everyday life but presented and progressed in some of the most humorous and random ways possible. In that way, the jokes remain relatable but still have their own touch of creativity to them.\\n\r\nThe nature of the show makes it incredibly easy to watch it whenever. There\u2019s no story to follow so it doesn\u2019t matter if you take your time with it or choose to watch it alongside other shows even, yet it still retains that sense of enjoyment and puts you in a mood that only persuades you further to click for the next episode. So whether it be occasional or binge watching, the experience remains fun either way.\\n\\n\r\n===Art and Animation===\\n\r\nIt\u2019s no surprise that being a title produced by Kyoto Animation, the visuals are top notch. But when I say top notch, that doesn\u2019t exactly mean the art is of the most detailed or realistic kind. On the contrary, Nichijou offers a rather plain and simple looking art style that is quite different from what you\u2019d see in KyoAni\u2019s other works, but it fits really well towards Nichijou\u2019s comic-y style and compliments its theme to a great extent.\\n\r\nThe Animation is amazingly fluid as well. And especially when it comes to some of the more exaggerated moments, the high quality animation just add to the humor and overall enjoyment of the show.\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also some nice attention to detail, namely towards the characters movements and reactions. The way these characters react and behave, such as the changing of their facial expressions might alone be enough to score a laugh.\\n\\n\r\n===Sound===\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is presented such that it always seems to fit the mood of the show at the moment. Being a comedy slice-of-life, the score consists mostly of pleasant and up beat music which always seems to lighten the atmosphere. But what is far more impressive than the soundtrack is the voice acting. The seiyuus did an excellent job voicing these characters as some of the best moments came out of the way some of the character\u2019s dialogues are carried out and by simply adjusting to the way a joke is delivered through these character\u2019s voices adds much value to the comedy.\\n\r\nI also feel the need to mention that the Opening sequence, the first one in particular probably has one of the catchiest opening songs I\u2019ve heard. It matches with the nature of the show almost perfectly. Really puts you in the mood and stands as an excellent way to start a new episode.\\n\\n\r\n===Characters===\\n\r\nA comedy is never complete without a cast of fun characters, and thankfully, Nichijou has it covered. The characters are truly some of the most fun and lovable out there. While they appear silly and absolutely ridiculous during most scenes, they still manage to retain their cute personas that you\u2019d normally see in a slice-of-life. I\u2019d describe some of these characters as simply adorable, going about their shenanigans presenting their own selves well through their many actions.\\n\r\nThere is one thing I would point out and that is these characters should not be expected to show any major development. Go in fully knowing that these characters have their set personalities and in their own ways, offer to the entertainment of the viewer and the presentation of the show. They are in no way deep and should be enjoyed and taken as they are presented towards the theme of the show.\\n\\n\r\n===Presentation===\\n\r\nAnd here is where Nichijou manages to excel the most. Even though it consists of practically no plot and a pretty ordinary setting, the way it\u2019s all presented is what really makes it an enjoyable watch. One of the things I loved about this show was how it makes use of some of the most innocent humor and still manages to entertain, and it\u2019s all due to proper execution. Even the little visual effects and animating techniques add so much flavor to it. The show presents a great sense of humor that almost anyone can understand and enjoy. It\u2019s not something that only a small demographic could hope to comprehend. It works for practically anyone.\\n\r\nAlso, one cannot help but notice how creative everything is. The way an ordinary situation transitions into something you could have never expected is very well done. And it\u2019s not just a scene developing into whatever the hell came to the writer\u2019s mind, it\u2019s something that relates to the joke and makes it all that entertaining in the first place.\\n\r\nNow I did say that the humor works for practically anyone, but in the end it still does come down to personal tastes. The show does present a few scenarios that some viewers might find to be a bit over the top or just bland as a whole. Thankfully, to my experience though, such moments were very scarce and for the most part they barely ever effected the overall enjoyment I felt towards even a single episode, let alone the whole show.\\n\\n\r\n===Conclusion and Verdict===\\n\r\nNichijou is an excellent example of how you don\u2019t always need a ground breaking story or a complex plot in order to truly produce a great show. With proper execution and the ability to capture the hearts of its viewers, it is quite possible to score a high spot despite having those shortcomings. If you\u2019re looking for a great time and some pure entertainment then give Nichijou a shot, and I can almost guarantee that you\u2019ll come back with a smile.\\n",

            "content": "Every so often there comes a show that just works. It doesn't necessarily have to try too hard, it doesn't have to present complex themes, unique characters, or a well written story (or even a story at all.) No sometimes simplicity is perfect in its own right.\r\nNichijou is one of these shows.\r\nI'm not going to mince words here; Nichijou is a bare bones experience. It has no story. It has no character development. It has no overarching themes or messages it intends to convey. Its sole purpose is to make you laugh, and I'll be damned if it didn't make split my sides at points.Nichijou manages to touch all the comedic bases at once while maintaining its fresh style and humor throughout, and is all around a supremely enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou translates to something around \"My Ordinary Life\". While there is no story, we can find a somewhat discernible \"arc\" around the character of Nano, a robot built by the child professor Hakase. We see her attempting to fit into an ordinary life despite the massive key lodged in her back, along with the other various accouterments she possesses as a robot. But in all reality, Nichijou is a series of comedic skits and set-pieces, some of which are connected. The skits are always (at the least) funny, if not gut busting endeavors that still amuse me to no end now. The humor here ranges from high to low, and I am sure if I actually understood the jokes that play on Japanese experiences, I would find it even more entertaining. I still love it though; its a sketch comedy show at its finest. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise the show has a multitude of figures fleshing out the cast. The main characters (Nano, Hakase, Sakamoto [talking cat], Yuuko [best girl], Mio [other best girl], and Mai [really they're all best girl]) take up the \"Nichijou\" segments of the show, which can be considered the main act in this sketch adventure. Other colorful and fun characters are as bountiful as they are colorful (I wont spoil the fun of experiencing all their quirks for the first time by going too into detail) , and you'll come to enjoy, in time, the segments diverting away from our main cast that focus on the seminal cast of secondary figures. It's one menagerie of excellence, let me tell ya kiddos.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound wise the production quality holds up remarkably well to the quality of the show's writing. At times the animation is actually pretty damn amazing, which it doesn't really need to be considering it's a slice of life comedy show. The soundtrack is also light-hearted and fresh, perfectly complementing the show when it needs to. Really its the perfect compliment to an already perfect show.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe Nichijou isn't as objectively brilliant as some of the more traditional classics out there, but there's something to be said for a show that does everything it sets out to do perfectly. It might not be necessarily original, but it most certainly is funny as all heck. I love this show. Nichijou is truly a-\\n\\n\r\n10/10 Masterpiece",

            "content": "Every once in awhile, an anime comes around and grabs you by the balls and says \u201cwatch me you pleb!\u201d Against your better judgment, you listen to those instinctual feelings and binge-watch the hell out of it.  Nichijou was the recent series that had the effect on me.  I heard about it while perusing the interwebs at funny anime scenes and came across the one with the principal versus the deer.  After visually consuming this gem of a comedy scene, I was almost instantly on Amazon trying to find a copy of the series to purchase.  Nichijou, translated to My OrdinaryLife is truly anything but ordinary.  This anime is an intricately articulated masterpiece of slapstick comedy.  It is art in it's truest form.  I found myself laughing my ass off through every episode at least once, and also taken back at times due to the true genius of the writing.  Nichijou is an exaggeratory wonder with great art, sound and a magnificent script and is severely underrated by many in the anime community.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou was adapted from a popular manga written by Keiichi Arawi, and debuted on air in 2011 commandeered by famous anime director, Tatsuya Ishihara.  I mean, this guy's done lots of cool stuff like Kanon, Clannad, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and the currently airing Myriad Colors Phantom World.  So undoubtedly, Nichijou's got some expectations to live up to.  Naturally, Ishihara delivers and presents us with 26 episodes of mind melting awesomeness.  \\n\\n\r\nIt would actually be kind of unfair to officially grade the story of Nichijou.  There really isn't one when you look at it literally.  So, I'll instead focus on the writing.  This anime follows the every day escapades a handful of people go through.  Whether we're talking about the ever-entertaining school girl trio of Yuko, Mai and Mio or the role-reversed professor and robot and their talking cat Mr. Sakamoto, all the characters make seemingly uninteresting daily tasks watchable by anyone with an attention span, and believe me... mine is short.  There are also a few reoccurring scenes within Nichijou I found highly entertaining like the jumproping egg head dudes or the random rock paper scissors games the professor and her robot creation would partake in, always rigged by the professor of course.  There are a couple more of these types of scenes in the anime, and the sequencing throughout each episode ensures even the squirrliest of us can continue to pay attention.  That's perhaps my biggest compliment of the entire show.  Nichijou makes use of \u201cdead time\u201d so well, even if it's with a deadened scene like the ones in Family Guy.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I could literally sit here all day and talk about the high quality of writing in the show, but I guess you just have to go and watch it to understand what I mean.  Nichijou is not an anime you need to necessarily watch in order either, so if you're short on time, check out episode 6 first (it's the one with the principal versus the deer) if you want to sample the show.  That shit is pure epicness.  It's rare to find an anime that does what Nichijou does so well... whatever the hell that is.\\n\\n\r\nThere are certainly a lot of characters in Nichijou, and although there are some clich\u00e9 tropes that exist, they're entirely purposeful and only go on to add to the overall humor of the show.  I mean, this anime doesn't even need a story or in depth character development to shine.  Put loads of expressive and over the top characters together in one series and watch hilarity ensue.  Schoolgirls Mai, Mio and Yuko play off each other so well it actually made me step back and go, \u201cYeah.  THAT is how true comedy is written.\u201d Yuko is the standard goofy girl who often copies her friend's homework because of one reason or another and is highly competitive, even though she's not good at much and hates being insulted.  Mio is the cute, brainy blue-haired one with the crush on the popular guy at school and has a secret manga-drawing addiction.  Lastly, we have Mai: A soft-spoken, overly-sarcastic girl who seems to beat Yuko at every possible thing ever.  She's really as deadpan as you can get.  Other students of note at the school consist of  Kojiro, a sophisticated classic man who often rides a goat to school, followed by his butler.  (Is someone going to remind him that his parents are farmers??) as well as Misato, the tsundere trope that follows Kojiro around hiding her true feelings and often fires random pieces of artillery at him when he pisses her off (like where the hell does she pull this stuff from?).\\n\\n\r\nThere are even more characters including a naturally mohawked myth-debunker, a timid teacher with the courage of a 12 year old with stage fright and a talented wrestler that doubles as a principal.  Oh, and I didn't even begin to mention the 8 year old professor and her mom-like robot creation.  And, even with the large amount of characters, I feel the show balanced between them all quite well.  Just when I was beginning to think about why I hadn't seen a character, a knee-slapping scene would come out of the woodwork.  The writers even do a great job incorporating the Professor and Nano (the robot) into the rest of the character's lives.  I was wondering at first, \u201cwhere the hell do they fit in?\u201d  There's really a character for everyone in Nichijou.  While character development is lacking for obvious reasons, the golden writing and dialogue proves it unnecessary.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art style in Nichijou is atypical, and definitely does a great job of showing us that you don't need the same stereotypical character design in every show.  The manga is actually very interestingly drawn as well, so Ishihara had some good source material to work with.  Some scenes are drawn sloppily and others take on a super exaggerated feel to express the intensity of the transpiring scenario.  I also absolutely loved the zombified faces some of the characters exhibited throughout the series when they expressed certain emotions.  Again, episode 6 was one of the funniest anime episodes I have ever seen period.  The opening is epic and lively, and I love the stuttered lines uttered by the two singers.  The upbeat and irregular style exuded are refreshing with all the Jpop OPs we're used to seeing these days.  The ending was nothing special, but it added a nice bow on each episode's conclusion.  The rest of the music was catchy and sophisticated, though none of the tracks particularly dazzled me.  The voice acting was top notch though, with notable performances being Mariko Honda as Yuko and Yoshihisa Kawahara as Kojiro.  All in all, the art and sound were great, but not the best ever.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Nichijou almost as much as someone can enjoy a comedic anime.  I can't remember the last time I laughed this much during a series.  I couldn't get enough of the anime, and I fanboyishly talked about it at work to seemingly uninterested individuals.... but it was just that good.  I would recommend Nichijou to anyone who needs a change of pace in their anime backlog or someone who needs a good laugh.  Don't take this show seriously, because it certainly doesn't take itself seriously.",

After finally fishing Legend of Galactic Heroes, I felt I had to watch something much less demanding, and so I turned my attention to this series.\r\nI was expecting a good series and few laughs. As I just said, I wasn't expecting this.\r\nI should start with its best aspect, the art. Put simply, this is ART. Kyoto Animation went way over their limit, animating everything with near-impossible levels of detail.\r\nThe characters are the usual mixed bunch of high school students, until you mention the talking cat, the 5-year-old Professor, the unluckiest shrine owner in Japan, the robot girl (my personal favourite), theschool headmster who wrestles a deer...\\n\r\nI could have gone on for a long time there.\\n\\n\r\nI have to mention the opening songs, which need to be heard to be believed, as they are performed by one man without the aid of backing singers.\\n\\n\r\nIt's another slice-of-life story, or so it seems. The bizarre nature of the various running jokes makes this series go far beyond the limits of  usual slice-of-life series. \\n\\n\r\nAnd thus, it's probably the best slice-of-life anime I'll ever come across.",

            "content": "I imagine a lot of people wrote Nichijou off as yet another attempt to cash in on the moe craze. With other KyoAni productions (namely K-ON!), it often seems like all of the budget was blown on animation, with the story being of secondary concern. Nichijou does have the same \"slice of life\" style of storytelling used in K-ON! and Lucky Star, but unlike those shows, Nichijou is never overtly pandering to the otaku crowd in an attempt to move more merchandise. \r\nThe first handful of episodes led me to believe that Nichijou was going to be the style of \"comedy\" wherein the audience isexpected to laugh at cute girls doing cute things. This concept in no way equates to comedy, it can be entertaining in its own way, but I wish people would stop labeling it comedy. Anyway, once the show introduces its primary characters, things really start to take off. The best parts of the show occur whenever Yukko, Mio, and Mai appear together. Each segment they appear in begins with some simple catalyst that escalates further and further until the character's reactions are no longer appropriate for the situation. Dumb, little incidents often end with shounen style shouting, fighting, running, laser shooting, etc. etc. and its hilarious every time.  Near the end of the series, more attention is paid to secondary characters like Haruna, the girl with the ribbon who's catchphrase \"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh?\" always made me laugh. While not at the forefront of the story, romance plays a big part in Nichijou as well, with the two equally awkward teachers Sakurai-sensei and Takasaki-sensei always failing to get together and polar opposite students Sasahara, the rich kid, and tachibana, tsundere gun enthusiast, denying their feelings for each other. Before I move on, I should also mention Hakase, Nano, and Sakamoto. If anything, I guess these three are supposed to be our main characters, but their segments are never really as funny as the ones including Yukko, Mio, and Mai, and not as interesting as any of the number of random skits that develop the personalities of the various secondary characters. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the art goes, the show has excellent animation like everything else produced by KyoAni, but the character designs are quite a bit more simple than anything seen in Haruhi, or even Lucky Star. This works in the show's favor since the focus is more on situational comedy than the idealized physical traits used to create moe characters. Because this is a slice of life/situational comedy, the characters usually are just sitting around talking, but when the hyperactive shounen aesthetics overtake the slice of life storytelling, that's when the animation team gets to really shine. \\n\\n\r\nReally, the reason to watch this show is the format. Each main segment is very brief, usually something around five minutes, so if you don't like that particular segment, just hold out and a new one will be on shortly. Some of the best scenes in the show are the short, random segments (Things We Think are Cool, Love-like, Helvetica Standard, etc) that are interspersed between the ones that advance the overall story; although, Mio's dream sequences about the wooden cubes were way too long and did nothing for me personally.\\n\\n\r\nWho knows if future generations of anime fans will still be inundated with what is considered moe to today's audience; maybe K-ON! will seem quaint in the future, much like Love Hina or Tenchi Muyo nowadays (and how many recent fans even know what those shows are, anyway?). As much as it may seem like I'm picking on K-On and/or its fans, I actually enjoyed watching it myself. The point I'm trying to make is that more anime should focus on great characters and storytelling rather than current trends and fads to sell their appeal. If a new anime fan starts watching Nichijou 10 years from now, it'll be because of the comedy and the memorable characters, not because it followed a trend, and that's what the industry should really be aiming for.",

            "content": "Nichijou is a prime example of how success isn't a sign of quality. Nichijou did awful in BD and DVD sales in Japan, not even being able to sell a thousand copies in the first week of sales but, this is one of the most funny, charming and consistently entertaining shows I've ever seen and I know I'm not alone on this. Imagine that you take the randomness and wacky characters of FLCL and mix it with the style and sense of humor of Azumanga Daioh. The outcome is a lot better then you'd be able to imagine. Before you write off what I'm sayingas just hype, let me explain.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nAs the title implies, the story follows the ordinary lives of some high school students. The catch is that these aren't ordinary high school students.  It's just a bunch of lovable goofballs getting into wacky misadventures. There's really nothing else to it. No character development, no drama, no symbolism or even sense of progression and the show is so much better off because of it. Its simple and humor focused plot makes the show just that much better\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nJust like with the plot, the show carries a very simple art style. Character and environment designs are clean cut and never too complicated. The style also changes to fit the situation on a regular basis in order to reinforce the comedy of the situation. It's something you see all the time in other anime, especially in series that are animated by Bones, but it's done incredibly well here. The animation becomes more complicated and energetic when the show gets into the hyper active style of humor and it becomes more and more simpler and slow when it gets into the slower type of humor. It ranges from highly detailed to bare bones simple and often even mixes the two but it never crosses the line and becomes bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nWhile the voice acting is remarkable and the actors do an amazing job with a wide range of emotions, the same can't be said for the ost. The music in the show isn't very memorable or interesting. It compliments the mood well enough but it's not something you're going to listen to outside of the show itself. I honestly can't think of a single track while writing this review. It's not bad by any stretch of the imagination, it's just kind of unremarkable. This isn't the case for the opening themes. They're both hyperactive and varied perfectly reflecting the show. Go watch the first opening and you'll know exactly what you're getting into. The voice acting is exceptional. There is no dub but even in Japanese, anyone can recognize the great voice acting. The voice actors portray the characters perfectly. They frequently over act but it just works with the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nAs I already said, the show follows the lives of some high school students. There's also an incredibly advanced robot that's indistinguishable from human (besides the key on her back), an eight world scientist who reached the singularity to create this robot and a talking cat. The characters are just a bunch of idiots that do nothing more but get into funny situations. There's not a single one of them that won't put a huge shit eating grin on your face at least once.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell, I enjoyed this show immensely. It's essentially the Japanese equivalence to Spongebob due to it's hyperactive nature. It breaks my heart to know that there will never be a second season to this show because of its poor sales but hey, that gives more incentive to enjoy what we do have.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nOverall 10/10",

The art is refreshing compared to what I have been seeing lately.  The story is about a school's life and what surrounds each and everybody that you see.  Different characters, with different stories, and with different lives.  The sound is great whether its the happy go lucky beats of the opening by Hyadain (Kenichi Maeyamada) to the sweet sounds of Sayaka Sasaki and other ending songs sang by the cast.Speaking of that, the cast is great and when you look at the list, you'll be amazed at who all in it.  It's kinda like a who's who of current and past anime.  As one other reviewer said, Nichijou is fucking AWESOME.  Oh, yeah it is.",

            "content": "Selemat pagi? \r\nWatched 13 episodes.\r\nStory: 3, Poor\r\nThe story is, there is none. This is a slice of life anime without story. I really have trouble watching Anime without story development. \r\nWhat is great about this anime if anything. It's unfledged Comedy. But it's very Random Comedy. But so funny. If you don't mind a anime without story and just great comedy. Watch this. It's just a lot of side stories and random comedy. GREAT COMEDY!\r\nIt shows 2 groups of people in to different stories. One is 3 girls in School. Other is 1 Kid Girl, whom made a robot teenager girl to take care ofher that's living with their cat.\\n\r\nThen, it's 1 or I think 2 more groups. 1 Girl that is a Gun Maniac. And another with a guy and girl that's alone in a club doing nothing. Well, one girl reads a book while the other guy trying to figure out what to do or to save his club from getting disbanded for to few members.\\n\r\nAnd now and then, side stories about more people.\\n\r\nAs you can hear, it's SO boring. But yea, personal opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10, Outstanding\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic! It might not be the preferred style, everyone look pretty childish, but that is a fitting must for this Comedy, Slice of Life.\\n\r\nAnyway.. Totally outstanding Art. Very detailed and well performed art. It's really concentrated to reinforce the Animes Comedy. And does it so well.\\n\r\nOn this area, you will not be dissatisfied, unless you don't like this art style they used.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 Outstanding\\n\r\nWow, I mean. The Opening is just so fitting. Very well fitting Song for this Anime, and the background music during all the jokes is superb. Everything for the Comedies best. Very good voice acting. It's legendary. Love the childish voice for Hakase. It's unfledged. \\n\r\nMANY sound effects for even the smallest things. Like when people get nervous, they amplified the art showing nervousness with sound. It's EPIC.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8, Very Good\\n\\n\r\nIt's so many characters at such a short time. All characters and even supportive characters have a remember-able personality. The Main characters are epically done and well thought out. Like Hakase is a super smart professor that have made a teenage robot girl that takes care of her. It's really weird she made a robot but in the series, she does nothing else than being a baby girl. She is 8 year old.\\n\\n\r\nMany could fall in love with these characters. The Main 2 Groups that makes somewhat of story..\\n\r\nYuuko is a lively girl whom sucks at school. Always having troubles.\\n\r\nMai is a school nerd and says almost nothing.\\n\r\nMio is an average girl who from time to time likes to be playful.\\n\r\nThese three does a lot together, Yuuko being the one bringing the trouble, Mai the one that solves everything, and Mio just Average.\\n\\n\r\nHakase is an 8year old girl whom made Nano and acts like any 8 year old girl.\\n\r\nNano is the created teenage girl. Who acts like Hakases mother but wishes for an average teenage life.\\n\r\nSakamoto is their cat. Who is more of a guy that just likes to take it easy and not to be bothered and acts cool.\\n\\n\r\nOutover these are more characters. like Misato Tachibana, whenever she does something it involves real guns in a very funny way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6 Fair.\\n\\n\r\nI mean, When i watch it, the comedy gives me laughs, sometimes giggles sometimes i just literally LOL. But for me, I must have a story or I don't feel like watching it. I'm certain that many would enjoy this to 9-10 if you don't mind a poor story but superb comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 Fair\\n\\n\r\nIf I where you, don't just go after the ratings. I think everyone would agree mostly on the Art, Sound and Character. Perhaps Story, but Enjoyment is all personal and what you like.\\n\r\nIf you like Slice of Life, and especially Comedy, watch this. If you are one that needs a story to be satisfied and not bored, I would not recommend this one.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou excels GREATLY at Comedy, but lacks greatly in story. It's somewhat like Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei if you have seen it.\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound literally is amazing. Even that immature art is not really my thing. And by that I mean, these are High School students that don't even show a hint of breasts, not even teachers or grandmas. One female teacher here could really be mistaken for a High School Student.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Nichijou was a really special show for me and I hold it very dear to my heart. I felt that it had an extra layer to it that people might easily overlook, and I hope that by reading this you will see what I saw too. I'm going to write this as if you've watched the whole series because there isn't really much plot to spoil for you. \r\nStory 10/10\r\nI can understand why people can overlook the plot, but I found that it was really subtle, appropriate and really beautiful. What I saw were basically two arcs: the first is before Nano goes to schooland the second is after she goes to school. If you put those together, you pretty much get the plot of the entire series.....Nano goes to school. It was the details and the build up that made me love the plot so much. Nano is a robot (is that a spoiler?) so she is kept around the house to do chores. At the same time she lacked the confidence to try to fit in with other children (she's 2 years old apparently) because of the key on her back and was afraid that she will be excluded for being a robot. Short scenes throughout the first arc were explicitly placed here and there that show that Nano really wanted to go to school, but it wasn't really emphasized until around midway through the season when Sakamoto-San mentions it out loud. I picked up on these hints over the course of many episodes by reading Nano's body language, so when she finally went to school it was kind of emotional for me. It made me think about what a blessing it is to be able to go to school with other kids your age. \\n\r\nMy final point to add concerning the plot was an interesting quotation that Sasahara slipped in near the end of the season. He said something like \"everyday life is a miracle\" (that's the name of the show!), and after seeing how happy Nano was going to school and making friends, that sentence hit me like a train. These kind of hard hitting quotes kind of pop up here and there throughout the series and they are all relevant to the theme of everyday life.\\n\r\nI was really surprised by these couple details that swung the mood around, and I hope that everyone who watches this series will be able to see them and appreciate them as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThough the art was very simple, the quality was just really good. I guess you could compare it to drawing stick figures in high definition. There are a lot of interesting background details in a lot of the scenes too, and the animation for certain scenes were just hilariously good. Well done KyoAni.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe opening theme songs were so amazingly hyper and the ending themes were sweet. Perfect for getting up in the morning and laying down in bed at night (kind of like a routine day! hmmm....). One of the reasons I like to watch subbed anime more than dubbed is because Japanese voice actors are pretty amazing. I think one thing that was kind of notable in Nichijou was the screaming, which they pull off very well and adds to the absurdly outrageous humor of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters were some of the most attractive aspects of Nichijou, so if you found that you didn't really like them you will probably not enjoy it so much. \\n\r\nI already wrote a little bit about my favourite character Nano. She's really cute when she sees cockroaches and the last few moments of the last episode were unexpectedly emotional because of her key.\\n\r\nI really liked how three of the main characters were designed as three very distinctly different people, but still somehow got along as best friends. Yukko and Mai never understood each other at all but they are still able to make up with each other and play games together (without knowing the rules; were there even rules?). From watching the way they interact with each other I often questioned whether they were actually friends, but it was adorable how every time Yukko would just shrug it off and continue. \\n\r\nThere was and interesting bit of character development when Mio was \"crushed\" by her crush (hahaha dkm). After finally calming down she says something like \"life is like baseball: you just never know what's going to happen\". It's kind of random how she compares it to baseball, but at the same time I found that to be really relatable and I think about that quotation pretty often in my life. \\n\r\nAnother special moment for me was some half episode near the end of the series where Mio's friends put together a gift for her. What they gave her totally sumo-slammed my heart because it came completely unexpected from the fun, somewhat shallow relationships we see in most of the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nNichijou is the kind of show that caters to a pretty specific type of humor, and if you weren't charmed by the characters you probably will not enjoy it. Each half episode either features some outrageous random episode, or progresses the pretty mundane everyday life of the characters. I found that I enjoyed it the entire time I was watching it, and was suddenly amazed by the unexpectedly emotional bits they snuck in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nI found that this show was outstanding and I totally did not expect it. It was recommended to me by a close friend who thought I would appreciate the kind of humor it offered, but I ended up seeing a lot more than just that. \\n\\n\r\nI hope that after reading this you will be able to appreciate the intricacy and subtlety that Nichijou snuck in because I think it's often overlooked and consequently underrated.",

            "content": "Bias Review #001\r\nWhat is life? One could describe it as a series of events that we take for granted. Nichijou (My Ordinary Life) displays just that. It shows the everyday things in life we take for granted and some of the first-world problems we have everyday, but in a overdramatized, comedic fashion. This anime has all the characteristics of a slice of life anime and a comedy. Sorry, I just woke up, too, so please excuse the blandness and errors of the review. \r\nStory - 9/10\r\nNichijou's story is an interesting one because of the fact it has no linear story. Each episode will showcase oneor two events in a characters day. This makes for comedy gold due to some of the hilarious situations a character can get into, such as doodling a private picture in a notebook that   they forgot to erase, and then letting a friend borrow it.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nThe art style of Nichijou is unique, and can't be described with any other word than awesome. The way things are illustrated makes the events that more dramatic. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nThe Nichijou OST isn't the best, but it is good. Most likely, you won't hear a song that you'd download on your iPod and listen to (this excludes the OP and ED). The show has 2 kickass OPs, and the EDs are lighthearted and sound nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\r\nShit, I don't know why, but this is the one part of the review I'm seeming to struggle with. I'm finding it hard to conjure up the right words to describe the characters of Nichjjou because they are so damn unique. I'm sure many would disagree with me on that, but the fact that the characters can be so average seeming at one point, and then hyper as fuck is what makes it unique. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - tenouttaten\\n\r\nNichijou is a great anime and I definitely recommend it. It's one of my favorites (wow so bias) and it will most certainly be forever. If you have any criticism please tell me on my profile! Thanks!\\n",

            "content": "Nichijou is like that kid in the class that tries to be the class clown by saying random, odd stuff, in the off chance that it gets a laugh out of you. You appreciate his effort, but ultimately, he just isn't funny, and can be downright annoying. Nichijou is a show I walked in with very high expectations for. Kyoto Animation is one of my favorite studios of all time, and manages to create beautiful, unique, and entertaining shows. Everybody I've talked to who has seen this series has raved about how it's a masterpiece, so I wanted to try it out. Now, before Isay anything bad, I want to start off with the good parts. The animation is spectacular. It's unique, and you can tell there was a lot of work put into it. I also loved the voice actors and the OP and EDs. They were all enjoyable and were the main reason I kept watching the show intp the first place. Unfortunately, this is where my praise ends. Nichijou, as you may know, is a comedy show. As such, you expect it to be funny. Well, 90% of the time, the show isn't funny. Most of the time the \"jokes\" seen like inside jokes that you're not in on. Hell, half the time, the jokes don't even have a punchline. Most of the show's so called \"comedy\" is something strange happening for a drawn out period of time, and then another character reacts to the strange event. Now I don't want to make it sound like I don't like stupid humor, because I do. I love comedy acts like Monty Python and TV shows that have over the top situations. But most of the show just feels like it was written by a middle schooler. It just seems like all the show does is try to throw as many things on the screen as possible. Nothing in the show is coherent, either. It's kind of like a sketch show, but instead of sketches, random objects and events happen, without any rhyme or reason. I could forgive that if there was a comedic payoff, but there rarely is one. While Nichijou is undeniably a fun, well animated show, it is equally confusing, unfunny, and just seems to try too hard to be funny.",

It's totally random, bizzarre and most importantly - hilarious. If you're looking for a new Lucky Star then you're sadly mistaken, it's more along the lines of the classic Azumanga Diaoh if you ask me - and only when Osaka is having weird dreams about the Chiyo's Dad, the cat-thing.\r\nWhile some of the humour might not be understood because it's a really obscure Japanese thing, or it's just too downright weird to be that funny (one of the episodeshas a weird extended sequence involving these imaginary characters and two wooden blocks, I don't remember too much because it wasn't that funny).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are brilliant, my personal favourites are Mai, Hakase, Nano & Sakamoto. Shout out to Sekiguchi Yuria who is the 'Eeeh?' girl :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a really fun anime which might surprise you in how atypical it is.",

            "content": "Nichijou is still my number #1 favourite anime of all time, which is weird considering it's a slice of life comedy. Like I've watched way cooler plot heavy stuff but still here I am.\r\nNichijou's comedy is derived from creating hyperbole like reactions from normal life inconveniences/situations. Kyoto really blew the budget on everything just to emphasise all of that also, there really isn't any holding back. I can definitely see it being hit or miss however.\r\nNichijou always gives me this homely childlike wonder when ever I watch it when it combines its beautifully composed orchestral pieces and light coloured and simplistic art style with avery relaxed pacing at times. This is all of course used as a juxtaposition for when shit hits the fan and the animation budget goes from like a 5 to 11 and the orchestra turns into some intense Mozart shit when the slightest first world inconvenience happens.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of lol random XD humour but mostly because of how easily it is done wrong in mainstream media or anywhere really. This show is a big example on how random humour can be done correctly with well constructed pacing, setting and characters.\\n\r\nIt's also got the right amount of heart felt moments you can expect from a normal Kyoto slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really sad that the show was a critical failure with Kyoto investing a huge amount of money in it and it didn't catch on therefore getting rid of all future hope for another season. I would kill for the show to come back after it's finally earned the audience it didn't get when it came out. The fabled 'season 2' will definitely not happen however it'd be fun for CITY to get it's own show.",

            "content": "Nichijou is no doubt one of the best comedies, if not the best comedy to be made in this past decade. It does a really good job taking a slice of life and turning it into something unorthodox. It creates this sort of aesthetic flare with its dynamic art style, which essentially establishes and creates a classic comedic atmosphere. It takes random, and turns it into bizarre and extraordinary. It doesn't only accentuate comedy through what characters say and do, but also with the atmosphere and world itself. It is encapsulated and is ever overflowing with a very inventive world. It intertwines realistic and fictionmaking it appear as if they are all the same. It's jokes are very fluid, giving the itself an unpredictable approach every step of the way, which is very much need in comedy. It fuses gag, light satire, moe, and so on in the in one of the best ways done \"ever\". With all these qualities, I am sure you will always find yourself constantly reminiscing back on its highlights which is pretty much the entirety of the show. The show stands out from others with minimal effort and can be easily considered a classic and re-watchable. Thanks to KyoAni, future shows on the comedic road will always have a great and upstanding example of what comedy at it's prime really is.",

It doesnt have sex jokes, vulgar language, ecchi... its just clean fun\\n\r\nThe comedy is usually in the actions rather than the words. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of being totally hilarious, Nichijou is also light and it fits the slice of life genre well. After watching each episode i walked away feeling refreshed \\n\r\nThey usually from time to time take a break from the gags and show these visually appealing scenes with little movement or dialogue \\n\\n\r\nThere is a story in Nichijou but its not really the center. its not relied on much and its more of the daily lives of a bunch of enjoyable characters \\n\\n\r\nFinal words\\n\r\nI recommend everyone to watch and enjoy Nichijou, not because I told you so, not because a bunch of people on the internet gave it a 10/10 and you must watch it. no. none of that\\n\r\nWatch Nichijou if you want a light hearted comedy with no serious plot\\n\r\nIf you just want to laugh and have a good time",

It doesn't really conform to any kawaii culture tropes. No doubt it's incredibly adorable, but it's also supported by a GENUINE sense of humor.",

This is one anime that anyone and everyone can enjoy (Hell, I watched it with my 8 year old sister).\r\nStory ( --/10) -\r\nIf you are looking for any semblance of a story in Nichijou, I advise you to look elsewhere.\r\nHowever, this should not be taken as a flaw as it saves us the trouble of remembering extraneous things and instead helps us concentrate on the humour and humour alone. \r\nIn this regard, you can favourably compare it to Mr. Bean as both shows have: no story, episodic format, copious amounts of randomshit and are ideal representations of Murphy\u2019s law (anything and everything goes wrong). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 (11/10)\\n\\n\r\nAccording to me, this show has the wackiest set of characters that I have ever witnessed in any form of entertainment (and that list is long). The characters are diverse, have their own unique quirks and idiosyncrasies and every one of them is pretty damn funny.\\n\\n\r\nSome especially hilarious characters are: The rich, haiku spouting kid who comes to school on a goat (because chauffeur driven Roll\u2019s Royces are so mainstream), the Tsundere who pulls out a bazooka if you even talk about her crush and the Oh So Kawaii! pint- sized professor who exasperates her talking cat and her robotic friend cum maid cum cookie dispenser cum android dreaming to be an ordinary schoolgirl, with her childish antics (after all the Professor is 8 years old).\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I loved all the characters and this anime wouldn\u2019t have been what it was if it hadn\u2019t been for them. \\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)- \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Nichijou is spectacular. The backgrounds are eye wateringly beautiful and the characters are cute, well drawn and fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI also liked the fact that comedic scenes had special artwork (example- Yukko\u2019s beserk button) which made them all the more funnier. All in all, an amazing job.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)- \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were vibrant and upbeat. The voice actors did their job consummately and the background music was well done. \\n\\n\r\nFinal rating (9.5/10)-\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved this anime, its wacky characters and almost everything else about this show. I also think that the rewatch value of this show is high and I definitely look forward to watching it again, if possible.\\n\\n\r\nSo, just grab a beer, hit the couch and enjoy the misadventures of the cast. You won\u2019t regret it (you might get a hangover though. Just saying). \\n",

            "content": "Now i don't write reviews because i just don't have the time to do so. But for this show i will make an exception. I give this a 10 for a really good reason, for one the  anime industry seems to be hitting rock bottom with shows like Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi, Qwaiser, Blood C, and No. 6 (example of the worst of 2011 during Nichijou airing). the second reason is it is the vary essence of four panel manga brought to life by the most lovable cast of characters that act as a breath of fresh air in a industry that isrunning out of ways of making a new anime  that is deprived of a PLOT. this is obviously a four letter word that is deprived in anime now a days, excluding a handful of gems in summer of 2011, like Usagi drop. Don't get me wrong though, Nichijou takes this to an even greater extreem and erases \"plot\" from the dictionary.\\n\\n\r\nSo then what makes Nichijou so good, its that it uses Situation gags and a LOT of characters, each with their own unique personalities. These situations and gags are enough to make a person laugh till tears come out (it happened to me each and every episode). This style is vary unique and reminded me of four panel manga's throughout the show. Hell i can safely say its like the feeling of reading the sunday funnies. \\n\\n\r\nAs for other shows that it competes with, well... ***spoiler*** when you are competing with a show that has a robot that has a rocket propelled big toe that is activated by the key on their back... well i think that energy should be used for later works because they will not have a chance.\\n\\n\r\nI give this gem of gems a ten out of ten for giving me a show that is true to its self and its uniqueness.\\n\\n\r\nas a final warning don't watch this when drinking any thing, especially milk",

            "content": "Comedy is a most finicky beast, and \"Nichijou\" rides it with as much finesse as I've ever seen. Not that every joke lands, and of course there will be those who find none of the humor to be funny. However, with its range of comedy and overall skill, this series is a must-try!\r\nThe show is a compilation of short bits, distributed between the handful of main characters and their high-school antics/experiences. It plays out more like improvised skits than situation comedy, but somehow maintains a consistency between bits that allows for character and relationship development. Amazingly, Nichijou offers fresh jokes each episode and each bitno matter how short is given a thoughtful ending (unlike a lot of improv).\\n\\n\r\nStory [7/10]: Let's be real, neither comedy nor slice-of-life leaves room for much plot. Add in the fact that Nichijou is a high school anime told in bite-sized chunks, and the story is pretty much at an impasse. Therefore I was amazed to find that show does have an undercurrent of plot! The small storylines are neatly woven together, even finding such a proper and touching ending that no few anime shows lack.\\n\\n\r\nPacing [9/10]: I really admired the pacing of Nichijou. Each bit lasted from 30 seconds to a few minutes, but there were strategically placed breaks as well - moments of Zen, if you will. This was pure genius.\\n\\n\r\nArt [8/10]: The art style of Nichijou resides somewhere between standard anime forms and chibi, so that all the forms are androgynously cute. Everything is brightly lit and colored to match the lighthearted tone, though be ready for endless sweat beads on the more anxious characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound [9/10]: Nichijou is one of the few anime where you can tell how much fun the voice actors and sound crew are having, and their joy is contagious. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter [8/10]: Although the series is told in short segments, the characters still come alive piece by piece - each bit gives another snapshot of their personalities. It is surprising that the main characters are in fact complex, given how simplistic the anime seems at first. Each is playful and, frankly, adorable but has clear imperfections as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10/10]: There's not much else to say except that I loved this series. It is definitely not for those unfamiliar with anime humor and style, and even for those who are, it has a lot of purely Japanese jokes (e.g. puns and cultural humor). I didn't follow some of these, and can only imagine how much better it would have been if I could!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: [9/10]",

            "content": "In a nutshell, Nichijou is a set of short comic scenes, although related to each other.\r\nCharacters:\r\nThe main characters are school girls (First - emotionless girl, second - fujoshi mangaka, third - hyperactive genki) and loli-genius, that lives with speaking cat and a robot, that want to look like a normal girl. There are also a lot of interesting secondary characters, like shy moe teacher or wannabe aristocrat that rides his goat to school.\r\nStory:\r\nIt has no beginning and ending, we can say that there is no plot. School girls just attend school. Absolute slice of life. The main merit of this title is its splendid humorand atmosphere of daily life. The only one thing that happened is that robot-girl started to attend school.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:\\n\r\nDespite it was made by Kyoto Animation, there is no their typical art style. Drawing is simple, but pleasant. Opening and ending themes are fun and rhythmical, background music is also good.\\n\\n\r\nIf you expect light, a bit crazy slice of life comedy, you will probably enjoy it.",

            "content": "If there was one word I could use to describe this anime, it would be \"Innovative.\"\r\nAt first glance(or episode), I saw this show as a lazy knock-off of the \"greats\" of the slice of life genre like Lucky Star, Azumanga, etc.  Upon further examination, I saw little by little and in the details, how amazing this show was, until it became a masterpiece in my mind.\r\nAlthough anime like Haruhi and Chuunibyou may have the full blast of pure beauty, Nichijou has that same amount of effort poured into creativity.  Many things in this anime have never been animated this way(to my knowledge).You truly never know what to expect!  Nichijou is exciting because of it's huge cast of characters and locations.  They present so many characters in a pleasing, and not an overwhelming, way.  There's no way to know which way an episode might take you(or a scene for that matter!)\\n\\n\r\nThis show has left me on the floor gasping for air, from laughing too much.  The voice acting is incredible(especially Mio and Yuuko).  The art is explosive and entertaining.  The characters are very likeable, and since this is a slice of life comedy, I took the liberty of describing each main character from my own point of view.\\n\\n\r\nOVERVIEW:\\n\r\n        This is a slice of life that follows, for the most part, the \"ordinary\" lives of three girls in school.  Mai, Yuuko, and Mio.  Also, there are three other main characters that are slowly introduced.  They are:  The Professor, her android, Nano, and their talking cat, Sakamoto.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\n        This is one of many places where this anime shines!  This isn't your typical anime.  The characters are very well done and are very funny.\\n\\n\r\nMAI-Wears glasses, quiet, very serious most of the time and devious at times.  Has a VERY different sense of humor.  She is that character that always wins no matter what.  She is always prepared while others suffer.  At first, you hate her.  But most people tend to love her in the end.\\n\\n\r\nMIO-Mio is an average girl in terms of grades and social status.  She draws yaoi manga and is always trying to hide it.  She is calm 90% of the time, but when she does get angry, watch out, it's explosive.\\n\\n\r\nYUUKO-Poor Yuuko, lol.  She's no good at studies, and doesn't have a lot of confidence.  She likes to make people laugh.  It seems like the whole world is against her most of the time, but she has a good attitude most of the time.  She always smiles and is happy to be with her friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe Professor(Hakase)-The Professor is your dose of cute in this anime.  She apparently has no family, acts like an 8 year old(she is), but can invent just about anything she wants.  She made an android that looks human(Nano) and has a perfect human personality.  She made a scarf that makes their cat talk.  She can be innocently selfish, but she is very loving.  She's a typical little kid.\\n\\n\r\nNANO-Nano is pretty much the favorite character for most people who watch this.  She wants to be like a normal human more than anything.  She has a giant screw in her back that she hates but the professor thinks it's cute and won't let her take it out.  She takes care of the professor and is very loving.  She is also very moe.  \\n\\n\r\nSAKAMOTO-Talking cat.  Basically, this character is awesome because it is voiced by Minoru Shiraishi.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked, Lucky Star, Azumanga Daioh, Ika Musume, or Sergeant Frog, this is a must see!",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nDo you like random and crazy? Do you want to watch a show that takes the ordinary things in life and blows them out of proportion? Do you like good shows? Then this is the one for you! :)\r\nSTORY\r\nThe basic premise behind Nichijou is...that there isn't any premise at all. What the show likes to do is present the viewer with our \"main\" cast (Yukko, Mio, Mai, and Nano) in a variety of different situations ranging from stuck elevators to getting bit in the hand by a dog. Each may last for 20 seconds or go as longas seven minutes or so, but any time in-between is perfectly valid. Sure, some of the small arcs are interconnected in small ways (such as a running bike from the previous short zooms by during the middle of the next), but most of these small stories are completely random and usually unrelated to anything else that has occurred. There are other supporting characters as well (too many to list) and they too are apart, either alone or with each other, in the zany and crazy stories that are told.\\n\\n\r\nIs this a bad thing? Surprisingly no. It fits the show very well, and allows for you to just enjoy the moment for what it is. It was kind of interesting not having to worry about characters developing through drama or having a comprehensive world that fit the narrative, all of which was done quite on purpose. The chopped-up way in which everything is presented just adds to the hilarity and craziness of the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nFrom an outside perspective, one may think that the show is quite plain looking. And to a degree, that person would be correct. However, when you start actually watching the show do you realize how everything is actually extremely well animated. This is especially true for those over-the-top moments. The show does a fantastic job in terms of showing off effects, character movements, and background/foreground happenings.\\n\\n\r\nI think it is because of this plain looking design that the studio behind Nichijou was able to animate everything incredibly well. There are other smaller details that usually occur too, such as nervous-sweat that constantly exudes from the student advisor to the sleeping bubble that protrudes from napping characters. And after getting half-way done with the show, who do I find out is the studio? KyoAni. I had no idea that they were behind this, but after finding this out, it made perfect sense why the animation itself was of such high quality.\\n\\n\r\nI think it may be best to give an example. In the scene where \"Mio Goes Crazy\", the parts where she is flying through the air or beating up Yukko are not only hilarious, but are really well done. And this happens constantly. The show is good in terms of animation when everything is fine in the world, but when the scenario devolves into chaos, then the animation really gets kicked up a notch.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThis section is difficult. For this type of show, I think everyone going in knows not to expect anything growth-wise with the characters. After all, it is, at its core, a comedy. As such, it really comes down to whether the person watching really loves the characters or not.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, I thought the main cast was wonderful. I liked Yukko and her stupid jokes, Mio's inability to deal with her need to draw BL manga, Mai for being just completely oblivious to anything else around her, Nano for always worrying about people finding out she is a robot, and Professor for being such an adorable kid. They each have their own personalities, but they can definitely change to fit the situation/mini-story at hand. Which is great, because that is what gives it the comedy that it does so well.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the cast (and there are a ton of other minor characters), I think the only others that I liked to watch were the student advisor and the teacher (the two that had feelings for one another), and the new Principal (the one who fought the deer). Besides them, the others were fun but nothing to really care too deeply about. Again, this doesn't necessarily hurt the show, since it simply relies on a wide variety of situations and characters in order to concoct many, many different small stories.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nFor the first OP, I thought it was fine. The same for the first ED. The second ED was not that good to me, but I actually grew to like the second OP. The rest of the soundtrack isn't meant to be listened to on its own, but rather fit the situations as needed. As such, the OST is nothing too great.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I would like to commend the voice actors/actresses for the show, especially Yukko, Mio, Nano, and the Professor. I found their voices to be pretty unique, especially when the first two would get mad/angry. I felt like they gave it their all in their performances, and they never drop in consistency throughout the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI have to reiterate to get the point across: you have to like random, you absolutely have to like over-the-top, in order to enjoy the show and its type of comedy. Luckily, I am pretty easy to get a laugh out of, so for the majority of the show, I was doing just that. This is another of my favorite scenes, just due to the scale of what I am talking about. If you laugh at this, then you are really going to like what the show offers. There's nothing more to it really. Certain brands of comedy are not to the liking of others (as with all things), but it is pretty easy to know early on whether you are going to enjoy 26 episodes of fun characters doing insanely crazy things!\\n\\n\r\nI will say, some of the segments can be hit or miss, but they are almost always a hit. With that said, don't be too surprised if you find yourself not always laughing at what is going on on-screen. The show does try to do touchy-feely moments sometimes, but they pale in comparison to the comedy that it does so well.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, over 113 short stories compiled together to make many laughs and fun times\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, KyoAni shows off their skills as usual, especially during all of the over-the-top moments\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, while nothing ground-breaking, the characters themselves fit wonderfully with the world and give us the hilarity that ensues\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, only the second OP is good, but it is some of the voice acting that really left an impression\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, I like this kind of comedy and the show makes you laugh through every single episode\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "Not your everyday Slice of Life, Keiichi Arawi's Nichijou presents an interesting perspective on the concept of \"an ordinary life\". Absurdity, cuteness, and friendship dominate this heartwarming comedy's landscape, leaving with the viewer a memorable series of fortunate events for the days to come.\r\nWill you like it?\r\nYou may enjoy Nichijou if you...\r\n-- consider yourself a fan of the \"Slice of Life\" genre\r\n-- want a comfy, cutesy, feel-good anime\r\n-- prefer episodic or skit-like story progression\r\n-- thrive in the nonsensical or content without an immediate impact\r\n-- are engaged in series with high energy\r\nYou may not enjoy Nichijou if you...\r\n-- find yourself impatient with regards to niche humor\r\n--don't enjoy the cute aesthetic characters\\n\r\n-- require a series to display mature themes for enjoyment\\n\r\n-- have no heart/soul\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nNichijou follows the denizens of Tokisadame as they all experience the little miracles of their \u201cordinary\u201d lives. There are two main threesomes that the show focuses upon, the Trio Sucharaka and Shinonome family. Attention swaps between the two throughout a given episode, with occurrences of the secondary characters being sprinkled in between.\\n\\n\r\nLoyal to its spirit of randomness, the series is mostly episodic, with each episode divided further into \"parts\", up to 113. On average, a part will contain an event between the main characters and one of the several \"mini-skits\" of the show, such as:\\n\\n\r\n-- Short Thoughts (skits based off a random musing)\\n\r\n-- Like Love (heartwarming experiences)\\n\r\n-- A Little Miracle (surprising moments)\\n\r\n-- Things We Think Are Cool (random things the Trio Sucharaka find appealing)\\n\r\n-- Helvetica Standard (based upon Keiichi Arawi's other manga series, generally not involving individuals from Tokisadame)\\n\r\n-- Various recurring transitions such as jan-ken-pon, dancing, blurry scenery, etc.\\n\r\nIf anything could be considered a \"main story\", it would be Nano's aspirations and attempts to become your ordinary schoolgirl. Contrary to the manga, Nano doesn't attend Tokisadame High School until Episode 14, with the first half of the series serving as buildup for that event.\\n\\n\r\nThematically, Nichijou tackles various relatable topics for school-aged audiences and above, such as responsibility, friendship, fitting-in, and love.\\n\\n\r\nGenre and Characteristics\\n\\n\r\nSlice of Life animes are fairly simple: follow around a character and show what they're doing. Nichijou isn't much different in this respect, but it teaches us that the best way to show a slice of one's life is to make the ordinary seem extraordinary. Surrealism, exaggeration, and hyperbole dominate the series, transforming an otherwise logical, mundane world into something we all can appreciate a bit more: pure chaos. Attacking the genre like this allows for a series to avoid common faults and detriments, such as repetition, boredom, and misunderstanding. Stray deer wander on your school's campus? Wrestle with it. Stuck in an elevator? Contemplate life's purpose. Jab yourself with your pencil? Destroy the solar system. Considerably human-looking android? Made by an eight year old professor. This is Nichijou.\\n\\n\r\nThough probably only relevant for maybe 30- to 40-percent of the series, Tokisadame High School serves as one of the chief settings. While I am personally not a fan of the school theme myself, I was pretty surprised with how little that bothered me. When something you don't like is done right, it's very easy to look past it in favor of its more likable qualities. School wasn't the \"identity\" of Nichijou, as that responsibility owes itself to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, perhaps most importantly, one of the \"make or break\" elements of Nichijou is the humor, leading it more to be along the lines of Niche-jou. Some of the jokes end up falling flat, or perhaps lend themselves to cultural perspectives or \"you had to be there\" moments that cause it to be lost on you. What generally ends up saving awkward positions like this is the favorable reactions of the characters themselves, making up for the loss of comedic appreciation for a failed joke. It will pretty much differ from person to person.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nNichijou boasts a fairly inventive animation style, as much of it goes above and beyond the standard conventions and expectations of a Slice of Life series. When animation exists as a complement to the experience rather than solely the visual medium, the end result is a product of far greater quality than your run-of-the-mill animation. I'm not particularly good at explaining how the animation is great. It's really something you'd have to see for yourself. Everything is aesthetically pleasing,  sure, with bright colors and flowing motions being a staple of animation, yet there's a certain magic or energy to the series that truly stimulates us. Much of this is owed to Keiichi Arawi's stroke-heavy drawing style found within the manga, which Kyoto Animation did well in translating, so if you enjoy that, you'll enjoy the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters individually have distinct personalities, as though they might all wear the same school uniform (save for Hakase), their attitudes, actions, and set them apart. Much of this can also be owed to the immense variety of facial expressions utilized, an attribute always appreciated in good animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nMost viewers probably wouldn't expect a comedy or Slice of Life anime to have a memorable soundtrack, but that just goes to show how much Nichijou has going for it. Sound director Youta Tsuruoka, with a great deal of help from Japanese musical artist Hyadain (Kenichi Maeyamada), developed an extensive song list that contributes great value to the series.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is fairly quality as is to be expected. Hakase's voice actress Hiromi Konno could very well take an award for the best damned cute voice in anime. Seriously, it's impressive how well a (at the time) 36-year old convincingly managed an 8-year olds voice.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings for Nichijou are fantastic, personally some of the best that I've experienced. Hyadain as a performer exudes such an energy that fits the series so well, easing us into the chaos of Nichijou flawlessly. I compare its effect very much to that of Cowboy Bebop's \"Tank!\", as both highlight the intended vibe of their respective series. The endings conclude the viewing in a fairly cozy method, with the latter half of the series producing completely different ending themes each time. Seriously impressive stuff.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Nichijou is a diverse one. As mentioned previously, the two main threesomes receive the most attention, with the secondary characters appearing in-between parts.\\n\\n\r\nThe Trio Sucharaka is composed of Yuuko Aioi, Mio Naganohara and Mai Minakami. Yuuko is a carefree, energetic girl who can't ever seem to catch a break in school (or life in general). She tries her damnedest to entertain her friends, often to her dismay. Mio is an artistic and bright individual, aspiring one day to become a mangaka. She could be considered the foil to both Yuuko and Mai as she is the most centered of the three. Mai is observant and silent, intelligent and talented in her own respects. Despite her quiet demeanor, Mai is known to play a lot of practical jokes on her friends, Yuuko especially. The interrelationships between the three serve for the basis of the show's focus on them. \\n\\n\r\nThe Shinonome family resides at the Shinonome Laboratory and involves Hakase, Nano, and Sakamoto. Hakase is a child prodigy, having already graduated school and created several amazing inventions. Nano is the product of Hakase's brilliance, though ironically, she acts as the latter's caretaker throughout the series. Though she's a fully customized android, Nano wants nothing more than to act and be perceived like a normal girl. Sakamoto was a stray cat given the ability to speak through a specifically crafted scarf made by Hakase, though considering his arrogant attitude one may argue he was cuter without it. The Shinonome group brings you the cutest experience, and personally it was my favorite until the latter half of the series. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters involve additional students (such as the cultured Koujirou Sasahara or tsundere supreme Misato Tachibana) and their teachers (such as the anxious Izumi Sakurai or obsessive Kana Nakamura). Seeing all of the characters interact together helps to present Nichijou as not an overview of a certain individual's life but rather an invite into the home of the entire Tokisadame Family.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nFor this episode's version of Things I Think Are Cool, I feature nothing other than our discussion piece, Nichijou. I genuinely do not think you can execute a Slice of Life better than Keiichi Arawi's magnum opus. Between the lively characters, exciting animation, and unique delivery, it's hard to beat. So few anime are able to creatively make a name for itself through utilizing elements of its genre without being a product of it. Though it exceeds in many areas objectively, the niche nature of much of its content may dissuade some from continuing. Thanks to its segmented progression, you can check out a few clips beforehand and see if it's your thing. You never know how you'll feel until you try. Selamat tinggal!\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"The ordinary days that we live in may, in fact, be a series of miracles.\"\\n\r\n-Koujirou Sasahara\\n\\n",

            "content": "While I am quiet easy to laugh by any situations or scenes in an anime, I am VERY selective about what comedy anime I would like to watch. This very anime passed my multiple layer tests of acceptance without any hindrance just like going through an airport scans just bringing your boarding pass and passport while only wearing t-shirt, track pants, and rubber shoes. This is an anime adaptation of a manga with the same name created by Keiichi Arawi and animated by the very studio who brought The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, and the most recent Violet Evergarden, Kyoto Animation.This is Nichijou.\\n\\n\r\nThe core of Nichijou itself is in its title that really means My Ordinary Life. Yes, Nichijou is a story about an ordinary life. Playing with friends, having lunches, everyday life with your family, or even having a crush on someone. BUT the thing is, Nichijou is about an ordinary life based on how our imagination think. One example maybe is one time Yuko got her mechanical pencil upside down and when she tried to push the lead, her finger got hurt by the pencil's tip. It may be very simple but I know that it would be hurt like hell and so they took it into the next level by the point Yuko exploded and you know what, it did not just stop there. Nichijou really explored the theme of everyday life, made it exactly like \"how if the reality goes with how my head thinks?\", and perfectly nailed every time they delivered their punch lines without any feeling of \"oh, is this the same joke as before?\" because every joke they deliver is somewhat feels different to one another and make them unique to each of every jokes they had. Even if you think it harder, they just delivered the same punch line over and over again and never made us feel bored! And of course, I love how they delivered the relationship between Hakase and Nano which was very heart warming and really stick to the theme of Nichijou itself. This is a huge kudos for the writer! \\n\\n\r\nThe huge advantage this anime had is of course, the animation. Somehow the animation delivered by Kyoto Animation really buffs the punch lines deliveries. They added the visual value of comedy into the punch lines which made the punch lines more and more funny than ever. I always thought that there are some scene in KyoAni which go along like this : \"When they finished the overall animation of this anime, the higher ups said that there's still many budget for the animation. And so the animator went all out delivers their best to the animation\". I could feel how much fun and passion the animator had while working in this anime just by watching the anime. It was just like they were trying to say \"This anime is fun!\" to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is a very MUST watch for you all who love anime. For me, Nichijou is a perfect comedy anime to watch after days or weeks or months or even years of same ordinary and stressful life. Just pick any episode and I will surely find a gate away and a resolution to just do my ordinary life.",

Especially in the funny parts where they exaggerate the scene with lots of colours. \r\nSound: 7/10 - I was laughing so much I barely heard the sound in the background, but the sound I did hear was actually exaggerated too, just like the colours in some of the funnyscenes. But it was good overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 - all of the characters were very different to each other, in a good way. Each one of them made me laugh in a different way, and it was brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 - I really really enjoyed this show, funniest anime I have ever seen, I was practically crying I was laughing so much.

I've never been a big fan of the slice of life genre and admittedly it took me three attempts of starting Nichijou before I made it past the first three episodes. The show is deeply rooted in absurdity, but it just works so well for the overall product.\r\nNichijou doesn't take itself seriously and exaggerates to the max the seemingly normal/day-to-day events of an average highschooler's life. This is what I found most charming about the show in general. It reminds me what it was like to be a high school student and to revel in the 'now'.When everything was important and any embarrassment or unexpected emotion felt threatening to social life or life in general. It also emphasizes that joy felt during this time is on a much more grandiose scale.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou made me laugh so many times... Characters being ridiculous, friends doing funny inside-joke type things that only young people would do, and the extreme slap-stick humor that arises from ridiculously normal premises.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot compare this anime to others of its genre, nor am I experienced in writing reviews for anime, but I will say that I think a large spread of individuals can enjoy this anime for what it brings to the table: a lighthearted perspective on the world that will make you smile.",

            "content": "This anime is a mixed bag. Its strong point is also its fatal flaw. The thing is, when it's funny, it's like really really funny, so much that sometime I had trouble breathing and had to pause it. Some easy to miss details are also hilarious. The problem is that when it's not funny, it's really boring. And when you're a comedy/slice of life/school anime, you really have no room for any story at all. This isn't to say story is important in this genre but being non-existent mean the anime has to compensate our entertainment in some other way. The soundtrack and opening/ending creditsare ok at best. Art and animation manages fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't particularly unlikable but they aren't really that likable either, they're a bit silly but pretty average overall. I thought Mai was despicable, always being dead serious and \"winning\" any situation she was in. It felt to me that she was trying her best to act as cool as she could, at least that's what it appeared to be to me, and I hated that. Another I hated was Shinonome. I can't exactly call her an asshole, a bad person or irresponsible (since she's a child it's pretty normal)  but she messed with Sakamoto and Nano in nearly every scene she appeared in. Seeing a robot girl crying and scared of how her body was designed and asking to be normal while her creator is casually cheering that it's cool and she can store food inside her arm isn't something I find really funny and it's a running gag to boot.\\n\\n\r\nAll that is left for this anime is comedy. You might as well save yourself some time and search for the funniest/best moments on youtube. It also does not have much rewatch value imo unless you want to show it to your friends to see their reaction.",

I also really liked major plot developments through the show, such as Nano going to school, Yukko, Nano and Mai swearing to be friends forever with Mio, etc. \r\nART\r\nFantastic. Not only are things drawn well, they are animated fantastically as well. The changes in drawing styles of the characters are also a crucial part in the comedy. (You will see what I mean if you watch the show.) \r\nSOUND\r\nI was really impressedwith the background music. Each of them fit into the atmosphere so well, allowing the audience to be hooked onto whatever that's happening on the screen. Prime example is the music during the house of cards scene, the stuck lift scene, etc. Voice acting is also done very well, and in some parts make the show funnier than it already is. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the characters are developed well through the series. First of all this show has numerous characters and through the short intense funny scenes we get to know almost all of them. We see relationships between characters develop too, such as the good friends Yukko, Mio, Mai plus Nano, or the relationship between Misato Tachibana and Koujirou the goat guy. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nThe jokes are fresh and truly hilarious... to some people. It is an established fact that the sense of humour that Nichijou has going for is not right for everyone. First few episodes of the anime make this pretty clear so if you found them enjoyable you are likely to enjoy the whole 24 episodes.\\n\\n\\n",

Some people don't like comedy series due to its lack of plot, sometimes repetitive jokes or even because there not even that funny! I for one have watched a couple of series like Nichijou, Slice of life comedies. Mostly all of them are usually like 12-13 episodes long. Most of them get pretty repetitive and you don't really laugh. Nichijou has 26 episodes, wow.\r\nI really liked it.\r\nIts just something different while being the same. Its hard to explain, you'll need to watch it. \r\nThe comedy: Its simply refreshing, jokes come in any shapeand size and its variation is just the best. They rarely recylce jokes and heres the kicker, there actually funny! I found myself just laughing at the screen like an imbecile. Everything is just great, the expressions, the exaggeration at times, the general mood of everything. Its actually funny!\\n\\n\r\nWhat adds to Nichijou is the art. It might look like whatever but its actually pretty beautiful, Its so simple yet so good. Everything from the detailed backgrounds to the characters. Its all collides in one beautiful cluster f@ck. One might not notice quickly but you'll come to love it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound isn't really that memorable but it fits the atmosphere which is the important thing. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if your looking for a good comedy series to pass the time then look no further. This series will have you laughing, some stunts and jokes that you have never seen or consider will get you by surprise and make you laugh. Now i'll stop here so you can get watching.",

            "content": "TLDR: This is a love it or hate it anime. I personally found it very boring and unfunny, however there are many people who would argue the opposite. If you are on the fence about this anime, give it a shot by watching a couple of episodes as the many of people really liked it. If you are still on the fence because there are some parts of the show you liked but hated the random insert filler clips, then probably just Youtube search \"Nichijou best clips\".\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nAlthough there is no real plot to this anime, I also feel like there doesn't really need tobe. This is a comedy/slice of life anime so if you are looking for some kind of epic adventure you are in the wrong place.\\n\r\nHOWEVER, the way the anime is structured is just an incoherent mess of random and unrelated clips thrown together. I think this anime would have benefited dramatically if the directors opted for a 12 minute short format rather than a full length 24 minutes. The length of the episodes made the jokes seem extremely dragged out in addition to frequent 10 second interlude scenes of someone walking across the screen and 10 second shorts seemingly being desperately inserted by the directors to make the episode 24 minutes. For example this scene :*EP 1 SPOILER: girl throws frisbee -> dog runs and jumps to catch frisbee -> girl randomly pulls out shotgun and shoots frisbee* really made me go \"wtf?????? thats it???????\". Similarly, another scene *EP 2 SPOILER: girl 1: wow that cloud looks like a shark -> girl 2: wow you're right it does! Oh, I bought some milk -> cuts to girl 1 being sound asleep* really seemed pointless and unfunny to me. Either save those pointless scenes as bonus for the BD release, or cut it from the anime entirely. \\n\r\nOverall, the majority of the humour in this anime falls under the category of \"this completely random out of the blue thing that you weren't expecting happens, HAHA thats so random lul XD!\". It didn't really click for me personally so I didn't enjoy it but humour is subjective so maybe it will work for you. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nAgain art is somewhat subjective and the art style won't appeal to everyone, but I feel like it really suits the tone of the show. The minimalistic art style and somewhat muted colour palette complements the more relaxed and not so serious tone of the show nicely. It's also transitions to a more serious tone when it needs to be, emphasised by bolder lines to reflect the fast pace of dramatic action scenes.\\n\r\nEven if you personally dislike the art style, it is hard to argue against the quality and attention to detail that has been put in.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nIt's ok I guess. Not much to say\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nI can't really comment much on characters, especially their development as I dropped the show but from what I have seen they seem tolerable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I did not enjoy the show, but that's my personal experience. You might love it.\\n\\n",

I didn't see any faults in the art but there is room for improvement on the quality.\r\nSOUND 5\r\nThe music forthis really suits the show plan and boring. There is nothing special about the music there is so much things they could of done with the music. The voice acting is great they sound like skilled voice actors with experience. good job on that!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 6\\n\\n\r\nAll the main characters are a bit bland, but i do like Nano and the Professor, you can notice there personalities straight away.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 2\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment while watching this show was dreadfully low because all the clips were all boring, because the plot was very bad. Lets take another comedy show for an example like, devil is a part timer, that show has a amazing plot, and action put into the right places, where Nichijou has everything everywhere. I feel like there was no plan before they made it.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 4\\n\\n\r\nEven though there is good point in this show like the characters and the art,most things about this show are pretty bad. For me the main things i need in a anime is a good plot and enjoyment and those two got the lowest scores.\\n\\n\r\nJust a disclaimer, this is my first review ever please notify me if i have any wrong punctuation so i can fix it thanks!",

My favorite subcharacter has to be Daiku and his Igo Soccer club. Another highlight has to be the Professor's crush in Sakurai-sensei, very cute and funny. Sakamoto and Hakase are a big duo that also made me love the series.\\n\r\nLoved it!",

            "content": "After suffering a emotional feel destruction from Clannad After story I needed a series that was going to make me positive again. Nichijou is an extremely simple slice of life series that focus primarily on comedy provided by very witty characters with a unique animation style to boot.  I am going to miss this show and hope some day it gets some kind of season two as the manga is apparently still ongoing as I am writing this review. If you are looking for comedy than this series is for you. \r\nStory 9/10\r\nI put the story down a mark because there is no realstory to this show other than the character Nano who is a robot wanting to become more human. The episode in the series consist of comedy skits from principle character fighting a deer to a skit where a crow is talking. Majority of the skits focus on students of a high school while other skits focus on A professor and a robot in a laboratory. Some of these skits are absolutely hilarious which is pretty much what I ask of the show. If you are looking for a slice of life with some kind of story and lack a sense of humor you will not want to watch this show however if like me you are here for the comedy than this is a show for you. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nWhen you look at the art for the first time you will think \"well this is kind of dull and not as shiny as other anime\". The art style in this series does not look very expensive. However this pays off in various weird action scenes where the animation changes to instill more humor and wackiness. The character designs are neutral in terms of their design as they do not look too wacky or boring. \\n\\n\r\nSound  9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST for the series is used usually where the music is most suitable especially in scenes of humor where very archaic music is used to reference the characters humorous struggles. The characters voices in the subbed version of the show I was watching are on point with in terms of emotion you can get a sense of the character being angry or sad or absolutely frustrated.  Sound effects used for action scenes are on point with making the viewer more glued into what is happening. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nGetting to know the characters in this series through comedy is what Nichijou does best. You have the three main girl characters Yuuko, Mio and Mai who get the most screentime in the series who get into hilarious situations every episode. Getting to know these characters more you can enjoy the comedy surrounding them better while the same comedy develops their character for later skits. We also have the Professor and Nano who take  the same portion of screen time who get caught in situation where experiments go wrong. Supporting characters also get their own share of screen time with each being interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI have gotten what I want out of this series which is  Comedy. I will more than likely in the future look at some of the skits on YouTube to get a chuckle every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10",

            "content": "Slice-of-life is all about making the ordinary special. In effect, the success of every slice-of-life anime rides on execution and character attachment. Stories are simple, characters aren't over-the-top, and the sense of friends and family is almost integral. Excessive tea-drinking and cake-eating aside, it's not about engaging in a compelling plot and a powerful message. It's about enjoying the view and savoring every moment that transpires.\r\nIn the slew of Kyoto Animation's more stand-out productions lies an overlooked title that takes the style of Lucky Star and injects it with enough steroids to make fried mackerel a touchy subject between friends. \r\nExpect talking animals, Daruma dolls,Buddha statues, Malaysian greetings, teenage robots, armories worth of weapons, goat rides to school, kingdoms in airships, child professors, and go-soccer... At the same time, expect all of these interfering with what's supposed to be yet another school anime depicting the everyday lives of three high school girls.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 8\\n\\n\r\nThough the show presents a goal in which teenage robot, Nano, tries to fit into society by having a comically obvious wind-up key sticking out her back removed by said child professor, the plot revolves around everyone's trivial and outlandish experiences. It can be as simple as lending your homework for a lazy friend to copy it. And it can be as random as lending a small comic series about a kid late for school eventually riding a tiger across town to an altered version of Paul Desmond\u2019s \u2018Take Five\u2019 in place of lending your homework. Every episode is organized into snippets focusing on a selected set of characters and schticks, proceeding in chronological order at a lax pace as typical slice-of-life dictates. Setting structure aside, Nichijou\u2019s story presentation is an interesting case.\\n\\n\r\nOn one hand, every moment, no matter how normal or unnecessary, is shown. On the other, it completely blows each supposedly usual moment out of proportion. What could\u2019ve been a forgettable scene about losing your friend\u2019s wallet in an amusement park becomes a hilariously agonizing sepia montage about how anyone who lost a wallet could feel so dead inside. What would be laid off as a 10-second glimpse of a bad day is accentuated into minutes of silence, hard rain, and illogical misfortunes that hardly faze the characters. Besides being absurdly comical, it proves how every succeeding incident in a bad day gets more and more pointless after you reach a threshold of not giving a damn. Every situation gets revamped by the characters\u2019 emotions to achieve this exaggerated intensity that makes even the most ordinary of scenes refreshing and exciting. Nichijou makes it a point to illustrate how experiences have a totally different context when taken from the participant\u2019s perspective.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not all a rush of blood to the head though. Nichijou has its share of serene and sweet moments, and it often comes during the simplest of scenes; such as the \u201cLike Love\u201d segments about showing others some love or the daily struggles of the Shinonome Institute. This show may not be for everyone with its leisurely progression and scatterbrained attitude, but it caters to every kind of mood with its relatable topics and awkward dynamism. As the fun times pass, the show concludes beautifully by reaffirming that one day, we will all miss our everyday lives when the time for change comes.\\n\\n\r\nART - 10\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAnything worth doing, is worth overdoing.\u201d - Mick Jagger\\n\\n\r\nThis defines the art in all its wonderfully overplayed glory. Whatever the profits for K-On! were, Kyoto Animation sure splurged big time for Nichijou. The lack of any noticeable animation hiccups and drops in quality is already a merit in itself. \\n\\n\r\nNichijou\u2019s artstyle is an ingenious mix of children\u2019s storybooks and action-packed comic books. For one thing, the insane attention to lines and detail for its humble premise and design is amazing. Everything looks so crisp and well-defined despite the unrefined look. Every gesture, breath, and drop of sweat is accounted for, along with lines of emphasis for every single point of interest. Even most background pieces are outlined to make each frame cohesive with the characters. The colors are solid yet easy on the eyes, with effective use of shadows at key moments to bring the show to life. The additional effort in creating depth can be clearly seen during sunset, rain, and blazing sunshine when impressive lighting, reflections, and blur come into play. The best example of which are the Adult Swim-esque bumps between segments featuring animated and realistically rendered still shots of various locations around the locale. Other stylish bumps include random pictures and animations against a white background and the prominently defocused logo for Nichijou along with the author\u2019s name, Keiichi Arawi. \\n\\n\r\nThe immature yet bold motif not only resonates well with the manga source, but also provides a workable baseline for consistent quality. The simplicity of the character designs allows the art more room for freedom and improvement. And by freedom and improvement, I mean extreme overhaul when Nichijou demands it. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s sudden. It\u2019s totally uncalled for. But it\u2019s awesome. Creatively illogical as hell, but it works.\\n\\n\r\nThe art shifts are the glue holding all the randomness together. From reducing characters to their outlines to illustrate shock, to reducing an entire scene to its bare sketches with stunning camera angles just to depict students running down the hallway, Nichijou doesn\u2019t hold back. A simple scream of pain is enough reason to fund a particle beam coming out of a character\u2019s mouth that\u2019s strong enough to skewer the solar system. The mind-blowing part is that no artstyle is recycled so every transition is unique. The same can be said about the animation. It skyrockets at the most unexpected times; going so far as to slow down or even speed up with equally exceptional fluidity and clarity per frame. Even the regular scenes move as fluid as possible with occasional comic-like jerks to keep with the spirit of the artstyle. The animators didn\u2019t cheat; allocating a lot of frames and sufficient detail to animate every string of actions with quality.\\n\\n\r\nExtra commendations go to the artstyle references to other shows, Helvetica Standard\u2019s hyper-cartoonized style to remind you that the aforementioned is a manga within a manga, the masterfully done opening and ending sequences, and tons of priceless facial expressions (special mention to the iconic \u201cI don\u2019t care anymore.\u201d face) that almost always stole the show. Art for Nichijou combines modest designs, animation spikes, unexpected detail, and lifelike ambience to craft an entertainingly wishful world that still manages to feel familiar.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe accolades just keep coming. Nichijou\u2019s sound; the OPs and EDs, the BGM, the seiyuus themselves\u2026 All of it warrants praise. \\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are two sides of the same show. Besides featuring a fast-paced barrage of the show\u2019s content, lineless animation, and a cool aerial pan of the neighborhood which convinced me to spot all the characters, all of the songs are anthemic to the show\u2019s theme.\\n\\n\r\nHyadain, as the two openings\u2019 composer, producer, and vocalist (even for the female voices), nailed it with his zany and chaotic j-pop novelty romps that combine fanfares, guitar solos, autotune, chiptune, double-time drums, and catchy synthesizer hooks. Meanwhile, the endings counter the openings\u2019 uncontainable excitement with a more gentle approach. The appropriately titled first ending, Zzz by Sayaka Sasaki, shines in its utterly sweet vocals and endearing music box melody to resemble a lullaby bidding farewell to yet another day. It comes in three adorable versions to boot: the original (which, at 19 seconds in, sounds like a program crashing), a capella, and bossa nova. The second series of endings are a selection of ballads and folk song numbers sung by children\u2019s choirs and solo female vocalists accompanied only by piano and guitar. Every episode starts off all over the place and manages to find its way back home in the end.\\n\\n\r\nThen come the seiyuus who give the show a serious case of ADHD. Nichijou\u2019s voice appeal works in the concept of stark contrast. WHEN SOMEONE ISN\u2019T SCREAMING THEIR HEAD OFF, somebody speaks in an extremely hushed tone. Yuuko and Mio deliver a performance that far overpowers everyone else\u2019s decibels combined, not to mention Yuuko\u2019s flexible range and Mio\u2019s constantly cute tone even while straining her throat to kingdom come. Meanwhile, Mai hogs the spotlight with her nonchalant voice, aloof one-liners, and blank gestures that are enough to set them both off. The fact that the previews at the end of each episode feature a celebrity lineup of seiyuus voicing inanimate objects seals the deal for the talent at work here.\\n\\n\r\nOther notable voices that join the bedlam include Annaka\u2019s trademark EEEEEH!! and her scenes with Teacher Manabu, Misato and her lovey-dovey fits with the overly formal Koujirou, Tamamura and Teacher Sakurai\u2019s perpetually hesitant speech pattern, and the principal\u2019s rare but hysterical exhalations of fear. The Shinonome Institute is a separate identity; making up for the lack of cuteness by overflowing their segments with moe coming from Nano\u2019s anxiety and the Professor\u2019s literal childishness. The rest of the characters voices remain neutral; contributing to the gags purely because of their physical conditions such as Nakanojou and Tanaka\u2019s hairdo, Sakamoto being a cat while bearing an Osakan man\u2019s voice and Sekiguchi\u2019s eyes of little importance to name a few. \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the BGM doesn\u2019t go so far as to incorporate just about anything like the seiyuus and the animation do. Instead, it makes a smart move by sticking to an orchestra to ride with the mood. Pianos, woodwinds, strings, and brass are the main players with a few grand choral bits thrown in for the show\u2019s handful of epic moments. This setup makes the scenes feel more ironically normal than mind-numbingly bonkers. The BGM did well to complement and limit the show\u2019s tendency to go off the rails. It also has a keen sense of timing. Majority of the implied punchlines in Nichijou occur when the BGM stops playing to shift the audience\u2019s attention to the seiyuus, ambient noises, and most especially, the animation. On rare occasions, the BGM takes the reins while the entire scene plays out like a silent film. Execution of the BGM could not have been any better.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 8\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a lot of characters to juggle. But then again, the focus dials down to the three main schoolgirls and the odd bunch at the Shinonome Institute. Other characters, being segment-exclusive, rarely bump into the main cast; thus putting a damper on any development of relationships. As far as a slice-of-life comedy goes, everyone\u2019s distinct but not exactly well-rounded. You only catch characters in select situations so most opportunities for growth are few and far between, especially when the show\u2019s forte lies in is its uncanny gags.\\n\\n\r\nYuuko, Mio, and Mai deserve center stage with the majority of the show\u2019s energy emanating from their chemistry. When you put a loud mouth, a short fuse, and a troll in the same space, you\u2019ve got the oxygen, heat, and fuel just asking for a fire. If the three girls represent the friends, the Shinonomes are the family. Underneath the child labor laws, animal rights, and roboethics, the Shinonome Institute can be seen as the show\u2019s take on family relationships. \\n\\n\r\nThe Professor, who should be technically considered as the creator of both a talking cat (Sakamoto), and a robot (Nano) is still a child like any other member of her age group. Sakamoto, certainly sounds the most mature and experienced, except that he still possesses feline instincts and mannerisms. Nano, on the other hand, is built as the Professor\u2019s caretaker as well as a teenager. And just like any teenager, she constantly tries to get through social norms and achieve independence from her maker; shown by her desire to break free from the shackles of being a robot. The catch is that she\u2019s only a year old; severely lacking in any form of social experience. Anyone of the three can be the child or the parent, making the relationship dynamic. But in the end, it doesn\u2019t matter who they are, as long as they support each other just like how any family would.\\n\\n\r\nIn the mess of all the quirky skits, Nichijou still manages to make room for understated character development. Key characters slowly learn to accept change and open their hearts to other people; gradually learning to embrace change and move on with the help of their friends and family. Amid the seemingly aimless amusement, the characters always go back to the show\u2019s slice-of-life roots. The development made sense of the characters' insecurities, which was a welcome change from the way the series poked fun at them.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 9\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the bigger picture, what you get is a series of mundane instances representing the various facets of highschool life; a fight between friends, sibling rivalry, family dynamics, club formations, puppy love, secret hobbies, and the like. However, watching each event unfold individually brings the show to a whole new level of hysteria and randomness.\\n\\n\r\nA fight between friends turns into an extended barrage of idiotic banter and hilarious smack talk, eventually subsiding with heartwarming apologies through subtle compliments. Sibling rivalry escalates into pranks involving shogi pieces, cat heads, and salt-cured fish jam. Family dynamics are there\u2026 between a talking cat as the dad, a teenage robot as the mom, and an eight-year old genius as the kid. Club formation revolves around the conception of a ridiculous hybrid of two sports. Puppy love turns into a battlefield featuring Michael Bay\u2019s reinterpretation of a tsundere. And even keeping hobbies a secret can mean bribing a cop and wrestling three bystanders, including a goat.\\n\\n\r\nThis added layer of comedy ranges from sudden, hot-blooded outbursts and non-sequiturs, to deadpan, farce humor with the brunt of the laughs largely attributed to the astounding voices, soundtrack, and animation. Plot-wise, events are as simple as trying to study for an exam or returning a lost handkerchief to a crush. In terms of execution however, Nichijou throws everything it has to make the scene as far from the matter as possible. Think of it as a well-rehearsed screenplay where all the actors decide to ditch the script mid-sequence. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s put it this way. Nichijou isn\u2019t everything but ordinary. It\u2019s everything AND ordinary; presenting everyday life as a collection of uniquely special moments that are supposed to be experienced, instead of described.\\n\\n\r\nAs wild, sweet, and weird as it can get, every second of this show undoubtedly has heart. Nichijou\u2019s wacky exploits are just another side of slice-of-life, in that the best way to experience life is to live in the moment, break the routine, and make life interesting yourself. Mio's concluding statement says it all:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cOur everyday lives may, in fact, be a series of miracles.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 9",

            "content": "Nichijou has got to be one of the best Slice of Life anime ever. It's not your ordinary Slice of Life because the way they act is so random and dumb and it's a good thing.\r\nThere is no story. Rather, it focuses a lot more on their everyday lives. There are two main \"everyday lives\" on this anime. The first trio are Mio, Yuuko and Mai and the other trio are Hakase, Sakamoto and Nano.\r\nThere are a lot of Slice of Life shows that are so boring. However, this anime takes it on a whole new level by making a lot of parts exaggerated andunrealistic which just works a lot. How? The humor of this show. I think it's safe to say that this show has the best comedy. I know, there's Gintama but, I have not watch that show (For how lengthy it is but I will watch that soon). There are indeed some parts on this anime that I didn't get but, most of the parts (Especially Yuuko's parts) are somewhat similar to my life when we get in on these situation. Except, this anime exaggerates it to the point where it looks unrealistic which is even funnier.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of this show is top-notched as expected from Kyoto Animation. Sure, it isn't realistic but the art-style is very unique and it's sparks my eyes on how beautiful the artwork is. The animation fits the show itself. There are just many parts of this show that the animation looks like when they exaggerate a lot of parts like Mio running to get her notebook back. They didn't made it look simple. They made it like this is some sort of action film which, I was very impressed. The soundtrack of this anime is also outstanding. It just fits on every part of the show and the soundtrack aren't even forgettable. The opening theme is also very good. Hyadain did a great job performing both of it's opening themes which I find it surprising that even on the girl's part, it was him who was singing.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters, I do admit that this anime adds so much cast but, I don't think they are forgettable. I can remember so many characters because the anime gives them the chance to shine.\\n\\n\r\nI'll go with the first trio first. Yuuko is an energetic girl though, she's also lazy. She keeps forgetting her assignment and because of that, she copies her assignments from Mio. This is my favorite character of the series because on how I can relate to her a lot in a lot of her situations that she has been through. Mio on the other hand is the opposite. She is hardworking but, what they both have in common is that they are both energetic and cheerful. Mai is the quiet girl but, she is somewhat the troll of the series.\\n\\n\r\nFor the other trio we have Hakase Shinomoe. She is a Scientist/Professor who invents a lot of stuff like robot but, she's just a kid and has childish personalities which... can be cute for some. Nano is one robot of Shinomoe except she acts like human and she has a personality. She has a kind personality but, really disciplines Shinomoe well. Sakamoto is the pet of the three. He is a cat but, he acts old (Because he is older). However, that doesn't stop him from acting like what cats do.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the show. This show gave me a barrel of laughs. Even if you dislike Slice of Life, I highly recommend this show. It's not your ordinary Slice of Life which is ironic because Nichijou translates as My Ordinary Life.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 9.4/10",

Nichijou is full of ironic situations, sarcasm, cheesy jokes, and just plain weird moments as a select few people progress through their daily life. Although the characters aren't as detailed drawing wise as I would have liked them to be, I couldn't help but laugh at the stupidity of the problems they get themselves into. Random is also a good word to describe Nichijou. Another good thing about this anime, is that if your TV and/or laptop for some reason decides not to let you finish an episode halfway through, butit let's you watch the next one, yeah you may be missing out on some good jokes, but you won't miss much of the story. Honestly, there isn't much of a story to begin with. Just randomness. If you're ever in the mood for an anime that isn't in the horror/action adventure category, or you could use a good laugh to cheer you up, I recommend this anime 100%.",

            "content": "Nichijou is a fantastic addition to the Comedy / Slice-of-Life genre. While detracting from the normal (much like Azumanga) it still presents much more \"normal\" concepts. \r\nThe characters represent standard stereotypes, but overall appear much more developed and enjoyable. The events that take place can be simple, such as taking a test or eating lunch, but can suddenly explode into a flurry of \"WHAT THE...?!?\" in a matter of seconds. Like other Slice-of-Life shows, Nichijou lacks a plot, but it makes up for that with its screwball comedy and solid characters.\r\nThe art and sound stand out among (almost) every other anime. The artistic flow followsthe action in the story. Tense scenes give the characters and setting stricter expressions. Light-hearted moments are drawn very light and give a sense of childish amusement. The art makes up most of my love for the show. The choice for the intro and ending is quite strange (yet interesting and fitting). Some might find it more appealing than others. Asides from that, humorous sound effects and excellent voice acting complete the set.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is occasionally hard to grasp, there are several pokes at Japanese culture, and a whole scene aimed at Japanese puns and plays-on-words. There is still a lot of slap-stick and simpler jokes to understand though, which aims to amuse a wide audience. On the topic of Audience, the show seems to aim only at a teenage age group, but around the 17th episode and beyond, there are some included sections which are aimed at an older audience. One of the older characters on the show speaks often of the past, and speaks with his grandchild often. His lines, I would say, attempt to instill nostalgia among older viewers. Every audience can be satisfied with Nichijou.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Nichijou is a rare and extremely enjoyable experience. It sucks you into their world and attempts to keep you. I was hoping for a second season, but so far it seems like nothing has been released. An excellent one-shot, and an amazing experience for those who are curious about the Slice-of-life genre.",

There is NOTHING ordinary about this anime.\r\nThink of Kuroko no Basuke. That is one of the best anime with exaggerations which makes it look so dam awesome. Nichijou takes that to a whole new level. \r\nThis anime is the most light-hearted and cheerful anime i've ever seen.\r\nStory: There is absolutely no story. You can watch it from any episode and still get 95%of what's happening. \\n\\n\r\n7\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is extremely unique and light-hearted.It fits everyone's personality and the environment really well.\\n\\n\r\n10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting flawlessly matches the characters espicially the 3 mains girls or the most screen time. I loved both openings and endings. During the anime the soundtrack was perfect for the atmosphere and situation.\\n\\n\r\n9\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There a heaps of characters but the main ones are the one's in the picture. They are SO FLIPPING FUNNY. What really impressed me was that how you got to see other students as well. you'll understand if you watch it which i recommend you do.\\n\\n\r\n10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nye that's right \\n\\n\r\nNow for the genre the anime was listed.\\n\r\nComedy, School and Slice of Life.\\n\\n\r\nFor comedy i give this anime and 11. Yes I'm serious. I laughed every episode at the weird jokes, the over-the-top EVERYTHING.\\n\\n\r\nFor school and slice of life i give it a 9.\\n\r\nThe reason is that there is so many things you an relate to in this anime. (If you're a high school student). But i did not give this a 10 because how it never ever goes to the extent in which this anime does. \\n\r\nBut that's why i love this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend watching this if you want to watch something that is not serious in any way and just wanna laugh.",

Sure, there's a few plotlines that continue over episodes, but the focus of the series isn't telling a typical story, and that's something that was new to me. The most accurate thing I can compare it to is probably the surrealist episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion. It's a beautiful show, and it's absolutely hilarious. All of the characters stick with you, and every single scene is interesting and original. The animation is also my favourite animation in any show,and the facial expressions and reactions of the characters are to die for. Please watch this show, it's a masterpiece.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Nichijou is by far the best comedy anime i've ever seen in my entire life. I'll try to keep this short, but here's why I think that this show is incredible, to the point where I legitimately wouldn't change anything about it if given the chance. \r\nFirst things first, Nichijou is a comedy first and foremost. While there is a bit of a slowly paced overarching storyline regarding the relationship between the two main groups of characters' (Mio/Mai/Yuko and Nano/Hakase/Sakamoto) the series priority is to tell jokes. One thing that I think really makes Nichijou stand out is its sense of continuity, which combined withthe series wide variety of humor creates a show full of running jokes that create a foundation and then build off of it. The comedy is layered in a way where a lot of jokes function both as their own payoffs and buildup to other jokes in later episodes. The voice acting and animation really bring Nichijou's over-the-top sense of humor to life. Earlier episodes consist of a number of small segments, while later episodes seem to contain more long-form scenes (which makes sense, as the two factions of main characters meet each other in the second half of the show)\\n\\n\r\nI also really enjoyed the series ending. Nichijou ended at the perfect time in my opinion. It gave closure to the main story points. Nano's character arc is complete, the main characters have become close friends, and Mio's determined to still do her best to ask out her crush. There are some things that didn't receive closure, but it really isn't that big of a deal. Nichijou, as a comedy , was never really supposed to be a story driven show. The comedy reaches a nice climax and the main characters' relationships receive closure, which is what's important. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review, even though it's for a show I dropped, I just couldn't resist ranting a little due to its popularity. I tried to get into this anime multiple times, but I still don't get its phenomenon. Maybe I'm just few years too late and I can't appreciate it as much as when it was airing. On top of that there's a lot of good comedies in recent seasons.\r\nStory:\r\nSeems like there's no real plot, it's just a slice of life gag comedy with a bunch of little girls. And since comedy is the biggest part of this show let's talk about that- it's not for me. I think it's too random, the jokes drag on for too long and sometimes it feels like there was no actual punchline. Part of the jokes just fly over my head, simply because I'm not japanese and part of them aren't that funny to begin with. If it manages to make me laugh/smile only few times per episode I don't think it's doing a good job as a gag comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe animation itself is very good, however I really dislike this artstyle, the character design is so simplistic that I wouldn't even count it as moe. It actually starts to remind me those chibi spin-off shows rather than a proper anime. Kyoto Animation is known for making cute and gorgeous-looking shows, but this one is neither of those things to me.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt's ok. Nothing in the soundtrack really stood out to me. The voice actors are doing a good job, but nothing really worth noting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThey're so forgettable that I can barely remember their names and personality traits. I feel like if some of the characters got replaced by other people, some viewers wouldn't even notice the difference. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis show has nothing to offer besides comedy which is subjective. But even if you'd enjoy this type of humor it's still lacking the story and characters while having passable art and sound. You probably won't miss anything if you just watch some \"Nichijou funny moments compilation\" on Youtube instead of watching the whole anime. I sometimes wonder if the people who give it a 10/10 score do it as a joke in similar way to Pingu in the City.",

You wonder why Yuko is so obsessed with the wooden blocks in Moi's hair, or laugh at how hard Moi tries to hide her sexual-themed artwork, and you'll feel sorry for Nano's strong desire to be seen as a normal girl and not a robot.

            "content": "Nichijou is one of those hidden gems I'm glad I've spent some hours of my life watching it, and here's why (I guess).\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nNichijou is an episodic anime for the most part. Each episode consists of random comedy sketches starring a vast cast of characters. Most scenes take place either at the school or at the Shinonome Lab.\r\nNow, why is Nichijou so funny? Well, it's simple - Nichijou overly exaggerates the quotidian. For instance, there's a really famous scene where Yukko, one of the main characters, stabs her finger with her pencil. She then proceeds to fire an hyper beam out of her mouthout of pain, destroying all the planets in our Solar System. Ridiculously hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first sight, Nichijou looks like a lazy anime in terms of visuals: chibi characters, simple lines, nothing too flashy, etc. Like they say \"don't judge a book by its cover\". Nichijou's animation is so smooth at times that it will leave you speechless. A perfect example of its crazy animation is the chasing scene between Yukko and Mio on episode 2 (correct me if I'm wrong).\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI love the OST of this anime, it reminds me of shows like Tom and Jerry at times because of its expressiveness. From cheerful orchestrated songs to sad piano themes, Nichijou has it all. Most songs stuck with me weeks after finishing the anime so I guess that's also a positive aspect of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are two main groups of characters in this anime: the school trio and the Shinonome Household. \\n\r\nThe school trio consists of three close high-school friends: Yukko, the energetic goofball, Mio, the short-tempered manga artist and Mai, the silent prankster.\\n\r\nThe Shinonome Household  is formed by Hakase, an 8 year old genius girl, Nano, a human-like robot created by Hakase herself, and, later on, by Sakamoto-san, a talking cat.\\n\r\nEach character has its own personality, they all feel different and unique. There isn't much character development though, but enough to make you attached to them in a matter of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is hilarious. There wasn't a single episode where I didn't laugh, in fact, there were some scenes that straight up made me cry. Even though this is a comedy anime, there are some melancholic scenes, most of these are ironic but still. I also love the way Nichijou made me tear up a bit at the last episode (we're talking about a comedy anime here!)\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNichijous is definitely one of my favorite shows of all-time - it's not perfect, but it is close, REALLY CLOSE to be. I seriously recommend you watching Nichijou if you want to laugh like crazy and feel good for a couple of hours (and cry too).\\n\\n\r\nNow we just have to wait for Nichijou 2 or even an anime adaptation of Arawi Keiichi's CITY...",

There are running gags throughout the series that call to mind Arrested Development crossed with some Tim & Eric - high-school-slice-of-life-anime-style.\r\nSome of the humor involves familiarity with Japanese culture, and a lot of the jokes are more recognizably funny with a rudimentary knowledge of the Japanese language (even with subtitles) but neither are necessary to enjoy the show, or evenreally enjoy it a great deal. You pick up pretty quickly on the style of humor and it's delivery, and learn to recognize the funny stuff within that vehicle. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I wouldn't hesitate to rank this show number 1 on my anime list, even over some more serious/dramatic/epic series.

The comedy goes on for 13 episodes with no plot and when there is a sign of plot it only lasts for 1 episode or makes a apearence in another episode later on. But most of Nichijou until episode 13 is just mini stories. Then when episode 14 starts there is a plot.While you might say episode 13 is where the plot begins it's realy just saying what will happen in this case being Nano going to school so i don't realy consider it a plot. Nano goes to school in that episode and a scientist want to capture her and research her but fails. The ending is pretty hearth-warming but i won't spoil it. \\n\\n\r\nI loved the series for it quikyness and hope there will be a season 2 in my life-span XD.\\n\\n\r\nHow do i know this and not my test material?\\n\\n\\n\r\nblog credit: me\\n",

            "content": "Everyday life isn't the most exciting concept in real life. We mostly make the most of it and just see to another day. But what if our routine is a lot more interesting than we think? \r\nThis series, although obviously Japanese, can apply to how everyday life, particularly in a average city/town, can be most interesting. While it is sometime before we have robots in our everyday life, everything else this series give can give hold pretty good ground.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nBeing a modern Anime/Manga, this story follows a series of characters living a normal high school life, although there are 5 girls and a cat thatfocuses on more than the rest of the cast. \\n\\n\r\n3 of the girls we follow are Yuuko Aioi, a cheerful brunette girl that has an average intelligence, Mio Naganohara, a blue haired neutral mannered girl that makes manga on her spare time, and Mai Minakami, and black haired poker faced girl that is essentially the troll of the series. The 3 girls go through school like normal with different days of mostly Yuuko getting into mishaps, sometimes having Mio involved like having an argument with Yuuko, and Mai having some sort of trolling action.\\n\\n\r\nThe other 2 girls are Nano Shinanome, a robot girl that was created to take care of her creator, 8 year old Professor Hakase Shinanome (which in translation sounds redundant doesn't it?). While how long Nano takes care of Hakase is an interesting discussion, the series picks up where Nano wants to live a life of a normal Japanese, which in her opinion is to go to school. Many of Nano's gags involve her inconspicuous wind up key in her back and what every secret modification Hakase has made. I mentioned earlier that a cat is actually part of the main cast, which he isn't introduced right away. The cat's name being Sakamoto, claiming to be older than the Shinanome girls, which could be true, but they go along with it, at least Nano does.\\n\\n\r\nNot only this series revolve around these characters, but also have multiple short stories or gags that occasionally pop in called Helvetica Standard. This section exist to give either a related gag to the main cast, or just there for fun. \\n\\n\r\nBeing a comedy series, there isn't a central problem or rather expedition like a traditional story. Instead, it's a series of gags, which is as expected. If you're looking for a academy award winning plot, you're looking in the wrong place. The story is more or less a set up for the characters to have their gags.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhat sets Nichijou apart from a typical Anime and also from it's Manga counterpart is how lively the animation was put. The effort put into the series by Kyoto Animation proves their stellar resume of series they worked on like Clannad, Hyouka, Full Metal Panic!, Free!, and more.\\n\\n\r\nThis time, Kyoto Animation gave Nichijou not only a color enhancer of the colorless Manga, but also having great animated special effects, such as when a character was bombarded with explosives, we see the distinct smoke clouds, the victim in a white color and their outlines. Although it sounds like a typical cartoon technique, it is complimented by the distinct pencil outlines of the characters and backgrounds along with the flat but bright enough colors to keep the attention of the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a genius nor even close to someone that works with sound effects, so I kept it a 8 out of 10 to not only keep a lower bias for the series, but also because the soundtrack was also average.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP's and ED's in terms of song quality are nice, but not my cup of tea. The OP's and ED's give good highlights of the series by referencing some of the gags that happen in the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nMy own judgement of how I rate a series aside, this category is where this series shines the most. All of the characters have distinct personalities and have little chance of turning the viewer off. Basically, there's a character for everyone. Personally, my favorite character is Sakamoto the Cat.\\n\\n\r\nWhile going into each character would be fun, it's really up the viewer to decide how the characters stack up to their standards. From my experience, most people I've met that watched this series all agree there's not one character they had a problem with, they're all likeable, only some more than others depending on the person.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nA comedy is only as good as the humor of the viewer. If your sense of humor doesn't fall under slap stick and some Japanese specific gags, then it might not be for you. I do sound pretty biased since this falls under my sense of humor perfectly. However, since it doesn't give such deep Japanese references, it will be more enjoyable than let's say Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhile I personally give this series a 10 out of 10, realistically for many people, this series gets a 9 out of 10, also by the logic of how I scored it anyways. This series not only show how modern Anime/Manga have great quality, but can be a great series to add to one's versatile list. Many quotable lines, easy gif clips, and truly a modern classic.",

            "content": "There are some things in the world that are meant to just... be enjoyed. A good laugh with friends, a calm moment with someone you love, and Nichijou.\r\nIf there is one thing I can say for sure about this anime, in a nutshell, is that its simplicity, combined with all of its \"gif-able\" gags, makes it one of, if not the best comedy anime out there. But let me explain in more detail:\r\nTHE STORY:\r\nIn concept, Nichijou's story would be something extremely clich\u00e9d for a comedy anime: it follows the everyday life of a bunch of high-schoolers and thier misadventures. And that's it. No extraordinary eventshappen (in concept). No magical girl falling from the sky or discovering special abitites or having to fight a metrosexual vampire, but Nichijou nails it nicely, going for short but effective gags and, as previously mentioned, \"gif-able\" moments that are outright absurd (like seeing your principal wrestle with a deer), and goes all-out on that nonsense side of anime that few manage to go and stay memorable, all doing this while having \"impact\"on a bigger world. I only wish it would have ended in a better way.\\n\\n\r\nTHE ART:\\n\\n\r\nThis is KyoAni at its best, for crying out loud. You need no more. The over-the-top cartoon-y style, mixed with visuals that will make you question if you are really watching an animation from 2011.\\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND: \\n\\n\r\nIt's not the most memorable of soundtracks, but it's still in perfect synchrony with the show's tone. The opening itself became a pretty good meme, and will always put you on the right mood for watching and get you ready to laugh, where its ending will give you a calm, and almost \"sad that it's over\" vibe. The voice acting is as good as it can get. They fit the characters as perfectly, and, as the show goes, you'll probably get close to these characters almost as your friends because of them.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nThere's almost everything you'll want to find in this cast. A deadpan troll as your best friend, a robot with all kinds of weird gadgets, an 8-year old genius, an armed-to-the-teeth tsundere, a talking black cat (and a crow), a club of soccer and \"go\", an airheaded teacher, and... Yukko (a.k.a. best grill), among much, much more. Most of them are one-dimensional characters for the most of the anime, with the exception of the main characters, but, as the anime (and the gags) goes, you see some character growth going on.\\n\\n\r\nTHE ENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nOnly two thing in life are certain. Death, and the fact that you will spent most of its runtime with a big smile on your face, when you are not pissing your pants laughing. It is a good \"healing anime\", perfect to be watched when you are stressed out or depressed.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nThis is a masterpiece that can never be forgotten, and it is highly recommended for everyone (even though the anime sometimes makes some jokes with cultural reference that some people might not understand). Every single episode is a guarantee of 24 minutes with a smile in the face.",

            "content": "Have you ever had a really good, aged scotch? Something that sparkles as it leaves the bottle and settles at the bottom of your glass. Pristine. You take a small sip, and the years it spent maturing take a blast at your senses in a strong, but reassuring fashion. It is rich, deep, supple, and entrancing. You feel sophisticated. You set down your glass as the flavor lingers, but before long, you're back for another sip.\r\nI apologize to all the non-drinkers out there for this analogy, but you get my point. Nichijou can be like my favourite scotch. It's not for every occasion, and noteveryone loves it, but when the moment is right and you just want to enjoy it for what it is, it will never let you down. Nichijou is a comedy, slice of life show, through and through. The name itself implies what it is about - Everyday Life. The \"story\", if you may call it that, follows the lives of a bunch of different characters, some of whom are school-going girls, some who are teachers, and some who are... exceptional. There isn't really any overarching plot or grand resolution where good triumphs over evil; heck, this show can be utterly random at times and leave you wondering what on earth you have just watched, but that's what makes it great. You can dive in knowing that you're not expected to understand some deep plot or pay attention to foreshadowing or any of those shindigs. You watch Nichijou for the inane comedy that exists in everyday life, and you'll identify with all the characters at some point or the other. This is the beauty of Nichijou.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art style for this show is very unique indeed, and while it is so drastically different from that of current shows with its lack of realistically drawn characters and special effects, it is brilliant at what it does. In fact, the quality of the animations and the overall impact of the art is easily the best feature of this show, and allows the rather interesting characters to go the extra mile and shine. Speaking of characters, I will leave you to discover them at your own leisure, and you will find a little bit of you or the people you know in all of them. This is why \"Daily Life\" really does seem like daily life. Almost every episode is full of pranks, practical jokes, awkwardness, tantrums, what have you, from start to finish. Presented to you in comedic fashion by the superb cast of Nichijou. Have fun snorting away in amusement as the people around you wonder why you're laughing so hard at a bunch of weird looking cartoon characters.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment of this show... hmm now this is a bit tricky to rate. Nichijou isn't a show that I can ever see myself binge watching all the way through. I don't think it is designed to be that way. This is something that you watch perhaps an episode or three at a time, when you're looking for a good laugh, before putting it away for next time. Which brings me back to my scotch analogy - you don't want to down a whole bottle of expensive scotch in one night now, do you? You want to savor it over the course of a weekend, week, or even a few months. Yes, it took me over 7-8 months to actually complete Nichijou because I took my sweet time with it, and didn't want it to end. Because you never want the good things in life to end, do you?\\n\\n\r\nNichijou isn't for everyone, but I can see it being enjoyed by non-anime watchers as well. Relying on a rather unique brand of humor, it sets itself apart as a comedic experience you will probably never experience again, just due to the brilliance of the writing, the beauty of its art style, and the sheer lovable-ness of it's characters. Watch it. Cheers!",

It keeps it real... well... to some degree at least.\r\nSome may think Nichijou is absurd but I have to disagree strongly. Yes, there are absurd scenes, but these really aren't absurd. Instead they are metaphors for the emotions that our characters experience. The show takes the simple feelings we get from everyday interactions and experiences, and exaggerates them to the extreme. So much so that it becomes entertaining if not funny.\r\nI can't emphasize enough how well I like allthe characters in Nichijou simply because they seem realistic. They're all flawed humans, just like the rest of us, and that makes them feel real and authentic.\\n\\n\r\nVisually this anime rocks. It makes no reservations about the style and freely changes it depending on the current atmosphere, and really makes style changes stand out. This is a method of telling a story I've seen very rarely in anime, and it's absolutely brilliant!\\n\\n\r\nSound? It's simple and enjoyable. Couldn't've wanted anything else.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, this anime is my perfect anime. There is not a single thing wrong with it.",

            "content": "Introduction- almost 10 years after azumanga daioh finished airing in japan,there was a newcomer to take its place..and that is nichijou.a very random anime that will make you love japan.\r\nnichijou means \u201cdaily life\u201d or \u201cmy ordinary life\u201d in Japanese and that is what the anime is.its in the \u201cslice of life\u201d genre. now when it comes to \u201cslice of life\u201d Azumanga daioh is the most popular and held to be the best slice of life animes due to the unforgettable characters and one of the first animes in its kind to be successful.\u201dslice of life\u201d is difficult to make in japan due to budgets andmost of the time there made to be short with only 10-20 episodes.\\n\r\nis nichijou a good \u201cslice of life\u201d ? does it stand up to other great animes in its class?\\n\r\nwell..yes it does.Before watching this anime,i didn\u2019t enjoy anime as much because ive seen so many horrible animes,and i wanted to give up on anime,so this anime alone got me back into anime.\\n\r\nFinal Opinions- seeing every 26 episodes i would say there are some great ones and some ones that were okayish\u2026but for the most part all the episodes are great and fun to watch,and it can make you feel happy just watching the bright colors and the happy music.i truly do love this anime and it will always be part in a top 10(if i ever do one) i do think this anime is the spiritual successor to azumanga with the cute and funny style the genre is known for.i truly do recommend this anime for any newcomers into anime,anyone into Japanese culture (there is a lot of it here) and anyone who appreciated the art of anime in general. even if you aren\u2019t into slice of life its still worth a look and its short with only 26 episodes.\\n\r\nContent- The anime is under the shonen section.which means its for younger audiences.which is a good thing if you are tired of seeing anime with constant ecchi or violence. this anime contains none of that at all,and in my opinion its one of the safest animes i ever seen.despite being for younger people,the anime is still fun and can appeal to older people with good messages such as motivation,friendship and not copying other people\u2019s homework. they will also poke fun at the messages too making them funny.another important thing to note,is that this anime is very true to it setting being in high school in japan.the anime pays good tribute to everything japan and its culture.seriously just after watching this and i felt like ive already been to japan. you can learn a lot from watching this like certain phrases and cultural things from japan.while still having fun,seriously this anime is all about cheering you up.\\n\r\nAnimation-The animation seems dull at first with simple designs for everyone,but when something goes crazy like running to class then everything changes dramatically and the anime has used a lot of anime styles and it can go from simple to very very detailed,which it becomes random and funny.the colors are also perfect and a great example of how anime is looking better with this new decade.\\n\r\nPlot- The story is about 3 high school girls in the second year , which is one side of the anime,and another is about a robot,with a professor who built her. and the story brings all of them together. the three girls are yuuko,mio and mai. yuuko is mostly seen as the main girl of the anime,she is not your typical Japanese school girl,she is more like Americans and mostly me who can be very lazy at school and uses our friends to copy off homework assignments.also we can relate to her as well because she isnt sure what she wants to do in life as a career and instead of stressing out she just lives her live happily and shows us that we need to be happy for what we have and not stress out as much.in the anime she always gets bad luck from simple dogs biting her to losing her wallet. still she stays happy..she is also not as smart as the others,with her friends she loves to make jokes but often fails to make anyone laugh this is probably why people like yuuko the best since they can relate to her..mio is second main girl and best friends with yuuko,she loves to draw manga and has a short temper. she is also nervous about showing her friends yaoi manga and keeps it to her self.being very diffrent from yuuko they managed to be friends. mai is the third girl and one word that sums her up is troll.she is always playing some kind of prank either physically or mentally and always out do yuuko,she is always very quiet and hardly speaks,she is seen reading a book or carving something.the other side of the anime has nano a robotic girl that looks normal except for a giant screw coming out of her back,this always bothers her as she wants to go to school and makes friends but fears she will not be accepted because of the screw,however just becoming friends with yuuko shows that people aren\u2019t all that mean,and that appearances don\u2019t always matter. her professor is more like her younger sister. she is known as the professor and is the one who built her. she always likes to eat snacks and always complains for childish reasons.they also have a cat called sakamoto who can talk thanks to the professor and the cat acts more like a dad and grumpy as well.he refuses to act all cute so he wouldn\u2019t be bother by professor.\\n\r\nmusic- the music in the anime is probably some of the best i ever heard,the opening is very well done and very catchy,same with the second one,and follows the hyperactive op and slow lullaby music in the end, characters themes that you will hear a lot and remember from scenes are also in the anime,as well as other music outside from the anime.\\n\r\nanything else- sadly the anime has ended as of now,still some manga chapters are still being released however,its just chapters from the anime already seen.the anime is very excellent and near perfect. this anime is truly for anyone who loves japan as a whole.",

            "content": "Much probably it's not the best anime ever made. Much probably it won't change anyone's life or win any award. But surely, Nichijou (\"ordinary life\") it's one of the weirdest, craziest and most unique series of all time.\r\nBefore I proceed with this review , let me specify one thing: if this anime did receive a decent amount of success in the Japanese market, I wouldn't care less of writing such rambling. The thing is: it didn't. On terms of sales, Nichijou was KyoAni's (the authors of very popular series like K-ON!, Lucky Star and such) Waterloo and is almost sure that they'll drop everything thatinvolves such series for that reason.\\n\\n\r\nNow, one could simply say: \"well, maybe this series actually IS that bad!\" -and as we all know, everyone is right to have his own opinion. But it takes a little research on the web to see how this anime received praise. I personally -and intentionally- searched for a completely negative review of this anime, both from professional and casual authors, and even I was surprised of the result: I couldn't find one. Now, I'm not the kind of person which bases his own opinion on reviews (in fact, I did such search after watching it all), but not finding a single bad review about it (and I read more than 10) had some relevance for me. As I said earlier (and many said before me, I assure you) Nichijou is no mind-blasting anime. It actually takes lots of time, patience and a very open mind to appreciate it, because it has a very \"hit or miss\" sense of humor. If you expect to roll over the floor laughing after the first five minutes, let me warn you: that's not how it works. The true courage of this anime is right that it doesn't \"beg\" you to laugh with easy jokes. The true philosophy of this series is actually quite the opposite. The sense of humor is ever-changing, because the authors always try something new and different to make you smile. And despite its exaggerated style, Nichijou -with its crazy situations and bizarre cast of characters- ultimately does what a successful slice-of-life comedy aims to do: it grows on you. And that very story characters you labeled just as \"silly\" at the very beginning might even end to surprise you by showing a depth that is rare to see even in the most \"serious\" animes.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I invite you to watch at least a couple of episodes - and for one, very simple reason. Even though it's not in my place to state what Nichijou deserves in the future, I allow myself to indicate what it doesn't deserve: to be forgotten, discarded and labeled like a \"failed experiment\". This anime might have met such tragic fate in the Japanese market, but the web can overthrow that outcome, by having people watch it and talk about it. And, at some extent, it's already happening. Here on internet, Nichijou stands defiantly against \"big names\" on term of popularity, gaining a small army of lovers and admirers - you just have to take a look on Youtube or DeviantArt to see that.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, what I (and quite probably all those who liked it) really wish for Nichijou it's not be outrageously popular today, but to stand the test of time in the years to come - and I've got only one way to do my part: convince you people to watch it... or at least, to give it a try.",

            "content": "Ah, Nichijou. What an interesting beast you are. Nichijou translates to english as \"My Ordinary Life\". However, there is nothing ordinary about this anime. You have talking cats, 10 year old professors, dog bites that make lasers, and everything in between.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story of Nichijou is standard. You have three high school girls that go to high school and do wacky things that attract the attention of absolutely no one. It's pretty much a moe comedy, except without the moe and amp up the comedy by about 9058340958 notches. 8/10.\r\nArt:\r\nNichijou was animated by Kyoto Animation. They've done a HECK of a lot of stuff, but they'remost notable works are Clannad, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and K-On. So how do they go from K-On to Nichijou? Well it's simple really. There is no reason. Anyway, the art in Nichijou is stylized. It reminded me of a children's cartoon, how it looked very pastel-ish. It had some awesome \"action\" scenes (look up Principal Vs. Deer - Nichijou on youtube), and every single frame is filled with imagination and vibrance. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OST in this anime is bland. None of the songs stuck out to me, it was all overshadowed by the animation. Besides the two openings, which are some of the greatest things ever. They're ridiculously catchy and fit Nichijou perfectly. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nSince this is a comedy, there isn't much character development outside of the last two episodes and some sprinkled in the previous ones to that. The characters, from start to finish, are interesting and have their own special quirk that makes them stick out. Mai has to be one of the greatest characters in anime, with Sakamoto not far behind. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nComedy:\\n\r\nI'm going to tie this in with enjoyment, and I'll be damned if I can find a funnier than this. Every type of humor is in this, so there's not something you won't like. Besides if you're one of the people who like everything straighter than a pencil, in which case you will hate this anime. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nNichijou is one of the greatest anime of all time. It's funny, it's charming, the art is great, and nothing about it is bad. This is a must see for any fan of comedies or Kyoto Animation. 9/10.",

Like there was one episode where Yukko goes over to meet Hakase and Nano, without any explanation and they start acting as though they are family. Now, they could've spent a little time together before they start enjoying themselves.\r\nStory:\r\nThere is no story. It just shows the daily lives of two seperate group of kids and the type of situations that happen in ordinary life that varies between intellect and emotionalness. Most of the characters are crybabies and the series can be loud. Nichijou is supposed to be a hilarious series but some of the jokes are morerandom than funny.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nMost of the characters range from being stupid and random (Hakase, Yukko) to nasty and unlikeable (Misato, Mio). Though, Hakase isn't as annoying as most child characters are, she still has her moments where she's being nasty or ignorant. She acts like a three-year-old while also being a child prodigy and it makes me want to kick her face. The only characters that don't fall under this range are Nano and Sakamato, who are a bit better but still above average, with Nano being the cliched \"I-want-to-be-normal\" girl and Sakamato being cute but when he's talking, he isn't being cute.\\n\\n\r\nSo, they're both archetypical instead.\\n\\n\r\nI know I'm being a little too harsh on the series but the writing could've been much better. This probably has the worst direction I've ever seen.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, this is my first review. \r\nTL:DR= Nichijou is funny, entertaining, colourful and more important it does its job! This anime makes you laugh! \r\n(WARNING: May contain minor spoilers)\r\nAlright, the real review.\r\nSTORY 8 : Nichijou hasn't a real story, it simply follows a timeline. The anime go through an entire year and throughout every episode you'll see the season changing. There is a character development, as normal. Anyways, what makes the anime special are that hyperbolic events that in every episode occurs, specially when the characters are Mio or Yukko. These events will make you laugh a lot, because they are normal but exaggerated atthe maximum limit. The reactions too are exaggerated. And all that makes the anime story even more better.\\n\\n\r\nART 8 : the art is... moe. Every character is drawn simply but distinct. The backgrounds, the little interludes in every episode (aside from those with Nano and the prof) are drawn like a camera in a real world. Colors and shades, anyways, are the focus of the anime. Nichijou is colorful and makes you happy. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND 7 : the sound is ok, i guess. Nothing to say. Openings and endings are cute and well made. Voice acting, instead, is gorgeous, specially for Prof Nakamura and Mr. Sakamoto.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 9 : In Nichijou, every character is different from the others, even if the art design is similar. There is the overreacting one, the quiet one and the not-so-normal one. Mio and Yukko are similar, and that could explain why they are best friends, Mai instead seems different but in the end is crazier than the two girls. Nano seems the big sister of the situation but is shy and has some little issues that you will know watching the anime. Professor and Sakamoto  are cute, specially the Professor. Every other character, anyways, has a story to tell in this anime, even secondary ones, like Nakanojo (blond punk-like hairs) or Japanese Prof (i dont remember the name, sorry).\\n\\n\r\nSo... what can i say? Nichijou is a good anime. It makes you laugh, it makes you giggle, it makes you smile. It's good. \\n\r\nNichijou is worth a watch, it could light your day with its hyperbolic non-sense everyday events.",

While the story may be very simple and without much depth, it works just perfectly for its comedic value.\r\nIts art direction became an iconic part of the work, making it easily recognizable, and while it's rather simplistic, they took full advantage of what they had. Visually, it's a pleasant and funny experience.\r\nThe effort made in sounds and music is unexpectedly amazing, with a memorable OST that truly knows how to set the situations,which also is self-aware of its exaggerations and out-of-place moments.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't get me wrong! Nichijou offers more than just comedy, even though it is the main focus. It is accompanied by soothing and emotional moments which will make you develop affection for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, the characters development might be my favourite thing about this anime, apart from its comedy. Every single person (and animal!) presented in Nichijou is full of color and personality, and the fact that the protagonists start to relate to each other, learn about them, while at the start is a complete zero, makes it an even more satisfactory and warm experience.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I think about it, it's possible that, in Nichijou, there might be no story at all. But while that is possibly their disadvantage, at the end it's just a crazy planet full of relatable stuff happening in over-exaggerated ways. It's just the ordinary life of some random people.\\n\\n\r\nWell... 'ordinary', until you find a parlant cat, a robot girl with emotions, and a gifted child who constructed said robot.\\n\\n\r\nSo, while objectively it could have a better story, I would rate it a 11/10 if I could, because deep in my heart I believe it was one of the best experiences I ever had with an animation, and that's what matters!",

It was adorable, I did more research and found out that people love this show and it had a premise that I could get behind. I watched the whole series, and liked it, it was cute, funny, and endearing. It is split into these three parts, being cute funny and endearing.\r\nThe Cute: 1/3 of every nichijou episode is centered around nano and Hakase, Hakase is so fucking adorable and entertaining that it makes her scenes really fun  The relationship between nano and hakase isalso very unique and pretty interesting at some points.  These segments just add to the feel good nature of the show. In most episodes there will be a little transition where nano and hakase are playing rock paper scissors, dancing, or bunny hopping. I look forward to these a lot and they are pretty fun to watch,and always make me smile.\\n\r\nThe Funny: The main draw of the show is that it can be pretty funny, sometimes. Not all the humor is funny and some of it is overblown, even the overblown stuff just got me to smile. Its usually shock humor, for instance a kid is talking back to an important speaker in an announcement session, a girl pulls up a real fucking revolver and shoots him square in the face, she then scolds him and he gets right back up to debate some more. Again nothing too funny but its exciting and induces a smirk or smile. \\n\r\nThe Endearing: It has a lot underlying themes of friendship and love that just gets to you. It really tops the series in an interesting way that makes it feel good and happy. \\n\r\nCONCLUSION: All three of these factors create one of the most feel good shows of all time for me and make it an easy watch when I'm feeling down or bored. Theres no big plot-lines or advanced fight scenes, just a lot of adorable moments and lots of smiles. Its a really cute show and if your a sucker for adorable kawii stuff you should check it out.",

It's certainly my number 1 favourite anime.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nNichijou doesn't really have a proper story line or plot like anime such as Love Live, Attack On Titan etc. Rather, it's pretty much just hilarious comedic sketches every episode and it's all random. That might seem boring and if you think that then fair enough but I actually found it really good and hilarious. Episodes tend to be split up into different parts with some sort of plot so I guess you could count them but the show overall doesn't really have a proper story lineor a plot. It's slice of life, after all. It;s not really supposed to have a major plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nThe art in Nichijou is different to art in a lot of anime. If I had to compare Nichijou's animation to another anime, I'd compare it to Yuyushiki. Anyway, I didn't think the animation was amazing but it was still good, definitely not bad. Maybe it could've had better animation for an anime produced in 2011 but I don't think it was bad to be honest. The constant entertainment makes up for the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nI'm guessing this refers to stuff such as the openings and endings. If that's the case then I found Nichijou's openings and endings to be really catchy and well made.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are all funny and really likeable. I'm sure they're relateable to many people too. Best girl is Mai-chan in case you're wondering :0.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI think it's pretty obvious what I'm gonna say since everything else I've said implies it. This anime is well made, enjoyable and hilarious! Honestly I never got tired of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nThis is a wonderful anime with hilarious and overall likeable characters. Everything else about it is good too. I recommend it for someone who likes slice of life, comedy anime. If you don't like that sort of stuff then you may well not and I can see why but I still recommend giving it a try.",

What I received was a perfect blend of character building, fantastic comedic timing, and sheer loved poured into this show. If you see a group of kids beating up Kyoani, I'm usually there, but Nichijou really made me completely change my mind. You can feel how much the animators and voice actors loved this show and wanted everyone else to love it too. It completely baffles me that this was not well received in Japan. Nichijou sets up a comfy mood episode one, and continuously shocks with abstract explosions and gags. The show neverlost this original comfy feeling, despite all this. Nichijou is a testament to what you can really bring out from a Manga to an anime. If you have fun working on a project, you'll hopefully make some fans have fun too.",

            "content": "I should say... Nichijou is one of the cutest yet funniest animes that I've ever seen. Even though that this anime has only 26 episodes, it's still not enough and I bet that if you watch this anime, you're going to beg Kyoto Animation for more episode of this one legendary slapstick comedy of the 21st century that you surely don't wanted to miss.\r\nThe plot of this anime is pretty hilarious and random at all times. Even though the plot is simplistic, the comedic approach is absolutely hilarious and the delivery is great. It's stupid, yet funny, that makes this anime not-so-boring to watch eventhough it is labeled as a slice-of-life anime. It's more like this anime reminds me of Azumanga Daioh: The Animation... but funnier...\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very simplistic though. When I first watched this anime, I expect something big here because KyoAni is giving too much details when it comes to art work and the animation is very colorful to watch. But here... well... it's not that what I'd expect though and they just follow what the manga has drawn there. But, the colors of the surroundings and the epic scenes of each episode is making the art of this anime shows more colors and abstract. It's pretty messy but... Well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds are also good as well. From the OP and the different versions in the ED, to the cute seiryuus performed here. Also, there's also added some famous voice actors/actresses who guests to this anime just to promote the next episode of this anime. Which is just a minority.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters here were pretty damn adorable and they deliver the comedic relief pretty damn well. And while the character development is slow at the start of the series, their true colors of each character is about to reveal as you move to one episode to the next. Meaning that even though there's some plot to it and the scenes were random, there are some storylines that could affect not just good for only one episode but to the entire anime plotlines as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's good that I didn't miss my chance to watch this anime. I want Season 2 to be release but I'm afraid we will never see the light of day (just like Hyouka did).\\n\\n\r\nYes, the anime is pretty damn stupid. But in a good way. And this is like a more innocent gintama version of this anime. There's no dirty jokes or sexual innuendos here. Just some plain, good fashioned comedy anime with innocent, yet, adorable young children just to do what they usually do in normal life... in a most awesome, and querkiest way as possible.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you have any problems or you just got busted with your crush... or maybe depressed, I suggest to go watch this anime. Trust me. Whenever I had problems with my life, Nichijou is the key of happiness and I hope this would help you to move on with your life...\\n\\n\r\nNah... who am I kiddin' JUST WATCH THIS ANIME SHOW AND YOU'LL BE JUST FINE AS F***...",

            "content": "Note: This review was written on my Review Book on Wattpad. If you are interested, don't be shy to check it out! (Link's in my bio)\r\nNichijou is an adorable Slice of Life anime that revolves around two different stories that eventually merge into one. The first, of three average high-school girls; Mio Naganohara, Yuuko Aioi, and Mai Minakami. The three survive high school, along with their many classmates and teachers,  as well as the many obstacles that come their way. The other, consists of your average, clumsy robot girl, Nano Shinonome, living at home with her 8-year old Professor, Hakase Shinonome. The two girlsconquer everyday problems and conflicts, such as what to do with a stray back cat, who now has the ability to speak due to a magic red scarf that Hakase had created, and how to hide Nano's Dharma, that's been covered in black marker. As the series progresses, the 6 girls cross paths, and become great friends. However, with these new acquaintances, come with even more little everyday problems. The cute little series is sure to make you laugh at least once, making it a great series to watch, and a personal favorite of mine. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI had found Nichijou not long after I had gotten my profile on Osu, a rhythm game for the PC that is really, really addicting. My friend had found out that I was playing it, and we started playing multiplayer immediately. Thanks to her, I've improved a lot  since March 2016, and I think I'm only 100,000 away from her in the rankings (Which is better than it sounds, since there over a million people in the ranks.) Anyways, one of the first songs we played was the theme to Nichijou. I thought it looked really cute whenever I played it, and I googled it to see where it was from. It turns out, the song was from Nichijou, and I started watching it immediately. I finished the series in a week, due to school, sleep and homework. Sadly though, the series does not have a sequel or second series to it, like Squid Girl, or Chi's Sweet Home does, but I believe it does the potential to have a second series to it. Anyways, as you can see, I really loved the series, and I really recommend it for anyone who likes a little comedy in their anime. Anyways, without further ado, let's get on with the review!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWARNING! THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nYes, we're starting out with  10/10. Deal with it. Anyways, Nichijou's story is very lighthearted, and full of comedy. It's one of those stories that seems like their is a point, and yet no point at all. Sometimes, the story wouldn't progress for another episode or two,  and just filling it with little cute and funny shorts to make you smile. And its not like it doesn't have a story, it really does. If the it didn't, I don't think the 6 girls would've crossed paths in the first place. The ending was also very heartwarming, seeing that the girls celebrated Nano's birthday, making her feel happy, causing the function on her key activate right away. The only issue I have with the ending was that the minor characters were not involved. I felt like they all should've had their little endings, like if the Teachers got together or not, you know, cute little endings like that. But yeah, otherwise the story was great and I give it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYep, again, the art style of Nichijou really goes with the adorable concept of the comedy/slice-of-life theme. I've drawn the art style one maybe a couple projects, because a lot of people had wanted me to draw more on Undertale Amino, and I ended up drawing a comic of Mettaton as Nano and Alphys as Hakase, and the art style was very cute, and easy to pick up. It took a little while though, since I had school in between. I really enjoyed how the series looked as if it jumped out of a manga itself, (which, it kind of did in fact), especially the \"Helvetica Standard,\" scenes. But yeah, nothing really to complain about for this section, so another 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nTired of the 10s yet? Haha too bad. No no, just kidding, just kidding. Kinda like how I mentioned with DBZ, Nichijou's soundtrack is really unique, giving it a certain vibe, but instead of Dragon Ball's action-packed vibe, Nichijou gives off a quirky and fun feel to it, going smoothly along with the characters of the story. In addition, just like Tales of Symphonia, I can go back to the series' soundtrack alone, and listen to it for hours, except I won't be bawling my eyes out over sad scenes like ToS. Instead, most of the soundtracks make you smirk or giggle. And that being said, the Soundtrack is given a 10/10, nothing to complain about whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOk, so don't get me wrong, I loved each and every one of the characters in Nichijou, I really did, it's just I wished they brought more of the minor characters out a little more. Like, I'm not complaining that they added the main characters too much in the series, I just wish they brought up some of the minor characters as well. For example, if you haven't noticed, I really like the teachers that wok at the school, Izumi and Takisaki, and how her brother, Makoto blocks in the way of their relationship. Though they aren't the main characters of the series, we see them every once in a while, and we get the idea that Takisaki has a thing for Izumi, but family stands in the way for either of them to get any further in their relationship. In a way, this idea brings out the short-and-sweet style of the Slice-of-Life genre, but, this is where I believe a separate side story should come in, revolving around the minor characters, rather than the main ones, relatively to how Lucky Star revolves around Konata and her friends, but also around Kyou and her friends, and Konata's cousin, Yutaka, along with her first-year friends. But anyways, seeing that I'm getting sidetracked with similar Slice-of-Life Animes, so I'm giving the character section of this anime a 9/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/General: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOk, so I don't know if I've mentioned this before, but I REALLY liked this anime. Like, it's one of those that I wouldn't mind going back to to re-watch it, but I don't have the time with a big \"Plan to Watch\" list of 40 different animes. It's definitely a great anime to check out, if you want a little comedy in your life, and you have a little time.  Seeing that I've watched a handful of Slice-of-Life Animes, and this being one of my favorites that also got me into the genre itself, that proves that I highly recommend it. Even if Slice -of Life isn't your thing, I still think you should at least give it a try. I mean, there wasn't that much I didn't like about the series really, and maybe I'm being to soft on the series, maybe I'm not. But anyways, all I'm saying is that everyone should at least give this anime a try, and if they do like it, great. If they don't, oh well, everyone has their own taste in anime.",

It puts you in an almost trance like state, and bombards you with unforseen historical and pop culture references, but the flow of all this chaos is truly astounding. Every scene seems to have the ability to make me laugh and/or smile in some way, which is exceedingly rare for me.\r\nAnyway, go watchthis now. It's a must see.",

Not only are the characters unique and the animation style top-tier, but the show is actually funny. I've watched a lot of slice of life anime, so I expected most of the jokes from this show to be like other anime comedies and feature ecchi/otaku humor, but I was wrong. Nichijou goes a step above any other anime comedy I've seen and uses really smart and clever writing to set up gag situations that even someone that doesn't particularly like anime can laugh alongwith. Pair that writing with the over-the-top, almost parodying animation style and you have a show that dazzles it's viewers with real laugh-out-loud moments throughout all 26 episodes. If you're looking for a show to recommend to someone who's never watched anime, make them watch Cowboy Bebop. But if you want to introduce someone to anime comedy, have them watch this.",

Like Azumanga-Daioh, it focuses on Josei Koukou Seikatsu and often makes no sense, but that is also its winning point. Still, relationships b/ w main and minor characters are a strong focus and may remind you of the  bonds you formed during high school yourself.\r\nIt will make you laugh at things you didn't think could be funny.\r\nAlways good when your brain needs a rest after a day at work. Not an anime to marathon or watch back to back.Like chocolate cake, good in small doses. Something sweet to bring some happiness into your day.",

And that is it's freaking awesome.\r\nI originally wanted to watch this just to get a few chuckles, but this anime has blown be away at how funny the humor is.\r\nTo me this is the best comedy anime I have watched and I feel no other anime can match its Humor for me now.\r\nGetting into the anime,\r\nSo this anime follows the standard cartoon style that you wanted when you were young. A 20 min episode divided into smaller episodes.\r\nStory:\r\nNichijou is just an ordinary story that is has the emotionsexaggerated to the point of infinity and that's one of the part of Nichijou that brings in the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNichijou is one of the best animated series I have watched. The animation was created beautifully and the mix of simple and detailed style depending on the situation and these emotions perfectly convey the situation.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nCute voice acting and great opening as well as the ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is the only anime that I have come across where I have loved every single character. From the main character to the side character. Each character have at least given me a good laughter.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis anime is amazing and really glad I watched. This to me is pure comedy gold. What started as an anime that I needed a few chuckle from ended up as an anime I binge watched and finished it before even realizing it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are still reading this, then what are you doing ? Go watch it.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "While the title suggests simple everyday school life, the contents are the exact opposite. Nichijou is just like Daily Lives Of High School Boys, but with girls and many more versatile characters. I heard many people say that it's a moe anime, well, they are absolutely wrong.  I found myself laughing hysterically over the absolute ridiculous activities of the school girls and the nonchalance of a talking cat! It's upsetting that the anime ended before i even realized how important it became in my uneventful life.  The voice actors were superbly coordinated with the characters and gave more oomph to them. The factthat they showed one of the protagonists to be a yaoi lover made me love the show even more for i could relate myself with her too much. the thing i loved about this anime is how it brought about the true emotions a human being has into fictional characters and also the friendship between the school girls. Aioi Yukko was one of my favorite characters because she was the life of the show. If Nichijou had no Yukko in it, i don't think i would love it as much. \\n\r\nAll in all, i don't think any character disappointed me, irrespective of how stupid  and ridiculous they may be personality wise, even though that was the only reason why the show is what it is. Nichijou is that kind of anime that can make you laugh and take a break at the same time. if you feel that you have too much of an intense anime, you can take a break and watch this one. Only a warning, don't eat your food while watching this because it's so funny, you won't be able to swallow it.",

            "content": "Nichijou, a comedy anime and a hilarious one at that. It's kinda like Lucky Star and Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou but is better than both of them from what I've seen.\r\nI'll be writing this review for a comedy anime only so animation, sound, character reviews will be based on that.\r\nStory 8/10:\r\nNo plot or story. Each episode is divided into skits. And each skit is a separate story. Some skits may link with each other across the series but they are mainly individual. So, almost all skits are funny and make you burst out laughing which is this anime's objective. As long as it makes youlaugh, it does its job right and that is why I love this anime. I'd put it in my favorite anime for comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nNot a fancy animation. But it's just what you'd expect of a comedy anime. Actually, if they'd improve the art and animation, the comedy wouldn't have been that funny. Character expressions are priceless and art and animation are amazing.\\n\r\nAs for kawaiiness, yup, the characters are pretty kawaii, especially Nano. Well, you can pick your favorites once you watch the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nI like both the opening of the anime. The first opening is especially funny along with its video. The second opening is also nice.\\n\r\nThe first ending song is ok. The second ending has different songs played on the same video track.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\r\nThe characters are what makes this anime what it is. Each character is hilarious, has his/her own unique personality and contributes to the show's enjoyment in one way or another.\\n\r\nOur main cast is Yukko, Mai, Mio, Hakase (Professor) and Nano as far as I see it. There are a lot of side characters and each has his/her own personality so you won't get bored by any of them. Each and every one of them makes you laugh. \\n\r\nSome romances for comedy sake are also present but this is NOT A ROMANCE anime. All romances are purely for comedic purposes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show from start to end. I even watched some of my favorite skits again, from the episodes or from youtube. There are about 110 skits as the numbers said but I think there might be some more which they didn't number. Then there are slight 10 second skits like \"Word of the Day\", \"Helvetica Standard\" etc which are really funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're looking for a good laugh and an awesome comedy anime to kill some free time then look no further because Nichijou is exactly what you want.\\n\r\nAnd I'll definitely be rewatching this series from time to time.",

Nichijou is a masterpiece.\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nComedic slice-of-life style anime do not need a strong story, as they can thrive on the characters and humor.  Nichijou manages some character development and conflict, but there really isn't much of a story here.  However, you won't miss it.\r\nArt (10/10):\r\nThe characters in Nichijou are instantly recognizable, and there are some great faces which punctuate the jokes.  The animation ranges from very good to outstanding, and there is superb editing in terms of comedic effect and timing.Also, the show has excellent OP animations.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10):\\n\r\nGreat voice-acting all around.  Mio and Yuuko's performances are especially good, and they have wonderful comedic timing.  However the best performance comes from Sakamoto-san.  The 2 opening themes are excellent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10):\\n\r\nEach character fills their role to build up some truly hilarious jokes.  The cast is large and diverse, but the author weaves them together expertly resulting in a masterpiece of comedy.  Certain characters are one-dimensional, but the protagonists are memorable, and even the somewhat flat side-characters shine when given the opportunity.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nI laughed out loud, every episode.  Each episode is also very re-watchable.",

            "content": "Nichijou is the reason I started watching anime. I remember thinking anime was whatever, that it just wasn't for me.  But the moment I finished episode 1 of this show, I was convinced.  \r\nFor starters, nothing is bad in this anime.  The worst thing I can think of is the story, which can't really be judged since this is a slice of life, and this genre doesn't need a cohesive plot to be successful.  Even so, the \"story,\" is still really beautiful as we see the characters grow their friendships which culminate in two heart-warming moments in the last two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThere are three main reasons I give this anime a ten.  It is incredibly funny, it is incredibly cute, and the soundtrack is amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nThe humor is sometimes on par with Monty Python in my opinion.  A very similar style, only with cute characters.  Seriously, the sketch where Mai and Yuuko play rock paper scissors is hilarious.  And the sketch where Mai pretends to be a lesbian sounds like something that would be in Monty Python. Things obviously get more ridiculous given the medium.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the characters are adorable.  In particular, Hakase and Nano are super cute together.  Expect a lot of cute.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd the God Damn soundtrack.  Hoooly crap is it a masterpiece.  I have no idea how KyoAni got the funds to do this, but the soundtrack is insanely good.  I can't really explain it, just listen to the songs \"Atatakaku Heiwa na Jikan,\" and \"Natsuppoi Koukou.\" They are both from the OST and they are beautiful. The soundtrack is tiers above what it needed to be for this anime.",

Well that doesn't matter,it is their opinion after all.\r\nSo here I go:\r\n--Story (Score: 8)/Character (Score: 10) --\r\nThe story is not good developed as I thought it would be. There are two main stories and other minor stories which sometimes don't actually cruises way with the main story character\r\nOne storyline A genius little girl called Hakase that actually made a robot Nano. Also Nano has a Key (like that cartoys that you turn around,release it and it goes off) and that is concern to her because she wants to be \"normal\" and go to school. Also more on, Sakamoto, a cat who talks, is introduced to the story.\\n\r\nThe other storyline is about three High School girls  Yuuko (Is the more \"energetic\" and decides the most crazy and unbelievable things), Mio (The most bright girl of the group, also has pigtail that develops the other girls' imagination upon it, that by my opinion is very funny), and Mai (She is a quiet and very intelligent girl, I could feel it by the way the author has chosen her style, mainly the glasses)\\n\r\nAlso the past history of the girls is not told which give the impression that their past is ordinary an normal.\\n\r\nThese two groups join together after the second arc of the anime (episode 13ish ?)\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Art (Score: 10)--\\n\r\nThe art in Nichijou is not unusual or extravagant, however the style shows well the type of atmosphere that they want to pass to the audience. The anime also used some features of the manga to show the character's mood (like on here: https://goo.gl/PD5g7w ) and basically all the facial traces stayed unchanged (different of some animes that changes some features from the manga to *cofcof* \"adapt it )\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment (Score: 10)--\\n\r\nNow, this is VERY VERY PERSONAL because you can thing on thing funny and I may not understand it, don't think it's funny at all or think of it as offensive (Like people say that Russian jokes aren't funny).That also changes from culture to culture (I am from Brazil and moved to UK, so I know it very well).\\n\\n\r\nThe joke starts with the title Nichijou or Everyday Life, that contrasts the anime completely, I find it very interesting.\\n\r\nThrough the whole show, the characters are found in unusual and hilarious situations. However, jokes are not used too much. By that, they uses the situations, characters' expressions and actions to create hilarious scenes.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I think that anime is one of the best of comedy that I've ever watched and the time spend watching was worth it.\\n",

Since the people living in this world have never seen our world, they have no idea what the existence of impossibility feels like, so to them, chaos was normal.  The idea of people exhibiting overpowered, world-ending, supernatural powers but only at random self-contained moments is as normal for them as...  as...  You know what?  Fuck it.

This is the one I can\u2019t do.  This is my Amy\u2019s Baking Company.  I am not going to stress myself out by trying to put this series into some form of understandable context.  Nichijou is insane.  It has a bunch of characters in it, and they\u2019re all insane.  The wide and expansive cast includes the students of Tokisadame High School, their teachers, their parents, and their neighbors.  \\n\\n\r\nOut of the two groups of characters that make up the bulk of the series\u2019 run time, the first group consists of three teenage girl friends...  There\u2019s Mio, a normal, average school girl who\u2019s easily swept up by the whims of her friends, which consist of Yuuko, the excitable idiot with so much energy that she could probably call Jolt a downer, and Mai, the weird bookworm who plays by her own rules without ever breaking from her stoic attitude.  The second bunch is made up of three very odd individuals living under the same roof.  There\u2019s Hakase, an eight year old genius whose intellect doesn\u2019t prevent her from acting her age, and she lives with two of her greatest creations...  Sakamoto, a tomcat who can talk thanks to a special bandanna, and Nano, an older looking robot girl whose similarities to the average teenager are belied only by the giant key sticking out of her back.  These character are of course crazy and unpredictable all on their own, but when you drop them into a world where princely farmers ride goats to school, people drop wet noodles down slides and dog bites cause Hyper Beams, their ordinary lives can and will become anything but.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou was produced by Kyoto Animation, and I would argue that it couldn\u2019t have possibly been on their plate at a better time.  Kyo-ani was, at one point, known for pouring money into their anime, giving it\u2019s animation an absurd level of fluid motion and lifelike quality.  This went on until they decided to go cheaper, as we\u2019ve discussed in my Clannad Afterstory review.  This new style, which was a major stepo down, would be carried on through the second season of K-on, where enough was enough, and a return to form was in order.  The first anime produced after K-On!! was...  You guessed it...  Nichijou.  This series is in many ways a return to form for Kyoto Animation, as it feels very much like a transition from their lazy animation period right back to their older style, with both styles very much present in it.  It also brought back that high level of effort and budget that the company had been sorely lacking, taking them into a new period that would carry on until they would eventually lose focus again with Tamako Market.\\n\\n\r\nYes, in many ways, Nichijou was to 2011 what Free would be in 2013...  A much needed revival for a company that was losing it\u2019s mojo.  Appropriately enough, just like Free, the animation in Nichijou is so lavishly funded that I couldn\u2019t find a single sore spot.  It still would have looked flawless with only 75% of the budget it was given.  It features a gorgeous mix of fluid animation from Kyo-ani\u2019s first period and the sloppy, cheaper style from it\u2019s second period, both used to their absolute best depending on the situation.  Every single movement is fluid, from complicated dance moves to over-exaggerated wrestling moves to beautifully rendered computer graphics for whenever someone...  Um...  Shoots a laser out of their mouth.  Almost every single moment on screen is bursting with energy, at least of course when it\u2019s intended to be.  They have no problem slowing things down when necessary, either as part of the build up to a joke, or those weird moments when a character learns a lesson and poetic text appears with them on screen.  These slower moments, which often feel like a break from the otherwise erratic pace, are often used as excuses to show off the exquisitely designed backgrounds, almost photorealistic in their presentation, and they greatly complement the much simpler looking characters in the foreground.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character design,  It looks like a combination of Azumanga Daioh and Lucky Star, and I mean that in the nicest way possible.  It combines the small bodied moe-blob aesthetic and low line-count of Lucky Star with the more grounded facial structures and high budget animation that\u2019s constantly showing itself off from Azumanga Daioh, and it results in character designs that are unique and very easy on the eyes, yet completely child-friendly with no attempt whatsoever to sexualize them.  The characters are brightly colored(with the exception of Mio, but I\u2019m guessing that was intentional), and can be presented in a number of different art styles, with changes in outline, detail, and even hard swaps between conventional anime eyes and simple black lines to convey their expressions.  Honestly, it\u2019s hard to talk too much about the animation in this show, because it can do whatever it wants to, and does, with only as much consistency as it wants to have.  It can be dramatic, it can be ridiculous, it can be intense, it can be laid back...  And it never really fails at any of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe same could be said for the music, which was composed by Studio Ghibli veteran Nomi Yuji, who really does give the series a menagerie of differently styled background tunes to work with.  The most memorable tunes in the show are probably the children\u2019s sing-a-long style tunes that play during Hakase and Nano\u2019s cutaways, I personally prefer the happy and carefree theme Ukiuki Happiness, as well as the more intense tunes that I unfortunately couldn\u2019t find names for, but I remember loving most of them in the show.  Both openings are addictive as hell, and despite having many similarities to each other...  They\u2019re both sung by a band  named Hyadain, combining a single male main singer with synchronized female background singers, and they\u2019re just catchy and fast-paced enough to keep up with the videos, which provide a sample of the fast and precise animation from the show.  There are plenty of different songs used for the second ending theme, but I personally prefer the one song they used for the first ending, the pleasant and relaxing Zzz by Sayaka Sasaki.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no English dub here, and I would normally never talk about Japanese acting, since I don\u2019t have the right kind of experience to judge acting in another language, but even MY untrained ears could tell just how good the original voice acting in this series is.  I don\u2019t know what well of energy Mariko Honda had to reach into to play the hyper idiot Yuuko, but I kept expecting her to injure her vocal chords and be replaced from just how fast and off-kilter the role demanded her to be.  Mai Aizawa didn\u2019t sound like she had quite as difficult a role in the more down to earth Mio, but considering just how much that character suffers from the actions of her peers, and how many times she has to play the character as angry and defeated, it had to be at least close to as tough.  As Mai, Misuzu Togashi only really had to stay at one register, but she still carried enough casual cruelty in her voice to fit the character.  Hiromi Konno played a standard, cute little child character, but when you remember that she also played Akira in Lucky Star, you have to wonder just how much effort she put into making the role sound easier than it was.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Lucky Star, Minoru Shiraishi is back, this time playing a talking cat who is, of course, at the mercy of his former Lucky Channel partner.  He doesn\u2019t sound quite like his other characters, taking a more deep-voiced and mature approach to his new feline identity, and last but not least there\u2019s Shizuka Furuya in the role of Nano, who\u2019s been assigned the more soft, moe-type voice, which makes it kinda difficult to judge the job she does.  Luckily, the main cast is made to sing their own character songs and alot of insert/ending songs as well, and she\u2019s at least notable as a good singer.  Interestingly enough, the cast is rounded out by a plethora of experienced voice acting veterans who play not actual characters, but inanimate objects that appear in an episode, and then deliver the next episode preview at the end of said episode.  some examples of this include industry giants like Aya Hirano playing a slice of cake, and Megumi Ogata playing a banner of tiny flags, and no, I am not making either of those up.  I\u2019d love to hear a dub for this anime where they do the same with a bunch of uncast guest stars, and I think a Sentai dub would be wonderful, but I\u2019m still perfectly happy with just the sub.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s been said before many times, and it still rings true, that animation is a limitless art form.  A single illustration can contain a universe of images that would be impossible to replicate in real life, and turning that illustration into a feature of pretty much any length can express an artist\u2019s imagination in explicit detail, and has the potential to go on to entertain billions.  Whether the animation is done on paper or on computer, the only conceivable limit to what\u2019s possible lies in the existing color spectrum.  Having said that, while there\u2019s virtually no limit to what you CAN do in an animation, adding the rules of story-telling places a harsh limit on what you SHOULD do.  For a plot and story to work, the universe the story takes place in has to follow a pattern of logic, and even if that logic doesn\u2019t fit in with the real world, it has to at least remain consistent in it\u2019s own universe.  Even if breaking the rules of the created universe is only used for comedy, it winds up feeling lazy and confusing, especially since following the logic of the universe takes a lot more effort and attention to detail, making lore-friendly jokes and gags feel all the more rewarding. \\n\\n\r\nTake, for example, Looney Tunes.  Characters are constantly shooting each other, playing repetitive jokes on each other, and even dying in some scenes, with the status quo erasing any consequences of their antics against each other.  This works, because the Looney Tunes know they\u2019re in a cartoon.  They make constant references to their own animators, and even to the existence of the audience, so when Elmer Fudd falls for the same trap again and again, there\u2019s an underlying understanding that he\u2019s doing it to entertain us.  No matter what happens, there\u2019s an understandable in-universe explanation from it.  Compare that logic to a Rooster Teeth cartoon, Xray and Vav, where there is no in-universe explanation to anything the characters do.  The main characters jump up and touch dicks...  Why?  A scientist tries to kill one of them with a ray gun, he turns to dust, but he\u2019s still talking and goes back to being unhurt less than thirty seconds later, and when he makes a remark about it, she threatens to do it again.  Why?  It didn\u2019t work the first time, so why threaten to do it again?  This is the kind of fallacy that the Looney Tunes are smart enough to avoid.\\n\\n\r\nGetting back to anime, one of the worst story arcs of all time was the Lost Island arc from Nadia, which I\u2019ve discussed in a previous review.  It\u2019s awful from start to finish, it ignores all logic and characterizations up until that point, and it begins with...  You guessed it...  One of the characters using Looney Tunes logic, inflating like a balloon and being fine a moment later, all because the new director didn\u2019t give two fucks about the work the previous director had set down before him.  In shows like Clannad, certain characters are capable of executing high-flying video-game style combat moves, and this is officially canon.  The series is careful not to put them in situations where they\u2019d need to use those abilities but can\u2019t, because that would be inconsistent and, frankly, a plot hole.  That\u2019s not to say all anime NEED to follow rules or consistent logic...  There are some anime where craziness and weird occurrences are the norm, but they\u2019re normally relegated to a weird character entering a previously normal world, like in FLCL, or they\u2019re completely aimless and inconsistent to the point where it all just winds up feeling dull, like Hare + Guu.  And that\u2019s if they\u2019re not wildly immature like Panty and Stocking.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that brings us to Nichijou, which goes about it\u2019s business by taking random weirdness in a new, and kind of obvious in hindsight direction:  It takes place in a universe where a complete lack of logic or sense IS the consistent logic of the universe.  When you run into a person by accident, it can cause a huge explosion, and nobody is harmed from it.  When your crush is out of line, literally shoot them in the face with a gun, and once the smoke clears, he might have to wipe off his fake glasses.  Nichijou exists in a world where anything can happen at any given time, and while the events going on may follow the barest of a cause-and-effect criteria, it\u2019s almost impossible to predict where anything is going to go.  Before going into this series, I thought that the title \u201cMy Ordinary Life\u201d was kind of a bland and generic name to give to a slice of life series, but it couldn\u2019t possibly be more perfect, because by calling attention to the fact that this is their ordinary life, you\u2019re forced to accept that these characters have grown up in, and are perfectly used to, a land that\u2019s only a few forced metaphors away from becoming The Dodo\u2019s Wackyland.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I\u2019m not stating any of that as a point against the series, either.  This set-up is perfect for the cast of characters and style of comedy that this series brings to the table.  In every way that matters, Nichijou is designed for two things, and the first one is the exploitation of possibilities.  The show;\u2019s three principal characters, Mai, Mio and Yuuko, have the kind of dynamic where you could put them in any situation imaginable and get something funny out of it, provided you\u2019re trying to.  Yuuko is always trying to be the center of attention, trying to make her friends laugh and get one over on them.  Mai is always trying to quietly and subtly beat her at her own game, finding weirder and much more eccentric ways to mess with the girl who\u2019s trying to mess with her.  Mio is the accommodating girl, trying to keep up with and appease them, and even though she wants to be the normal one and the voice of reason, she still has dark secrets to hide, she still violently over-reacts to things, and she\u2019s really just as crazy as they are.  \\n\\n\r\nThey have perfect chemistry not just with each other, but with the people around them, too.  Yuuko has her parents and teachers to deal with, highlighting her bad grades and refusal to properly study.  Mio has a boy she has a crush on, a yaoi manga she\u2019s trying to get off the ground despite her shame over it\u2019s contents, and she also has an lder sister who won\u2019t stop tormenting her.  Mai is...  Well, I don\u2019t want to spoil anything Mai does, so let\u2019s move onto the second group, which I enjoyed quite a bit more.  With the characters of Hakase and Nano, you have this really interesting dynamic that you could almost consider a passive-aggressive power struggle.  Both girls have some legitimate claim to authority over the other, which adds an extra layer of intrigue to their interactions.  Hakase created Nano, and has the ability to remodel her and control her at will, but Nano is the caregiver, the nanny if you will, and she exercises a small amount of parental authority on her inventor.  Throw in a talking cat that\u2019s smarter and more mature than either of them, but still needs help with the basic needs of survival, and you\u2019ve got a recipe for boundless material.\\n\\n\r\nTake these two groups, place them into your no-logic world, and there is nothing you can\u2019t do with them.  The writers clearly knew this, because they took their time exploring both groups thoroughly on their own before finally having them meet halfway through the series, and it winds up being am atch made in heaven as Nano finally gets permission from her creator to go to school, and her friendship with the three main girls is sparked by their confusion over the giant metal key on her back.  People would have accused Nichijou of jumping the shark if they timed this intersection poorly, but they didn\u2019t, so the unification of both groups begins while they\u2019re still both going perfectly strong on their own.  If I\u2019m being honest, though, there was one character in the supporting cast who I never really liked, and it was the gunslinging girl.  Yeah, I get what they\u2019re doing with her...  Parodying the tsundere trope...  But unlike the vast majority of the cast, including the side characters that were built off of her, everyone\u2019s good for multiple jokes, while she just feels like the same one over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nBut she does lead us to Nichijou\u2019s other purpose in design...  To make fun of the slice of life genre, as well as the moe comedy sub-genre.  The tsundere gun-gal is really the only blatant attempt they make at it, though, but it\u2019s kind of hard to explain how they do this the rest of the time.  For a quick example, take the once-in-a-lifetime wrestling match between Hulk Hogan and Shawn Michaels.  Hogan is notorious for having an ego and fucking over other wrestlers to make himself look good, and Shawn was booked to lose this match.  so what did he do, you may ask?  He made fun of his opponent by over-selling all of his moves.  If Hulk so much as threw a punch, Shawn would go tumbling out of the ring like a ragdoll, and the fans knew exactly what he was doing.  It was like when Tom Green made fun of all the tired cliches in late nineties rom-coms in his shit movie Freddy Got Fingered, although not nearly as soul crushing.  See, the genre that Nichijou is parodying is full of overblown emotions, dramatic and tense editing and cinematography that camouflages the mundane, and general melodrama.  \\n\\n\r\nThus you have Nichijou, blowing ordinary everyday occurrences out of proportion in a much more on-the-nose, ridiculous manner.  That\u2019s why, when someone gets bitten by a dog, they fire off a beam from their mouth that takes out a satellite.  That\u2019s why, when two girls are chasing each other through the school, the camera tilts, the art becomes monochromatic and everything stretches like they\u2019re going into hyper-drive.  That\u2019s why there are random contained occurrences that feel like they were taken from the writers\u2019 weirdest dreams.  I originally dropped this series a few years ago, because I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around what it was doing or the kind of humor it was using, and I just wound up getting confused, right up until a few months ago when a friend of mine put it all into context for me.  My most recent rewatch was much more rewarding, and I found myself laughing than any other anime that I\u2019ve seen in recent memory.  It\u2019s just like Mio said...  You never know what\u2019s going to happen next, and that\u2019s what makes it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou is available from Funimation.  The DVD bluray combo pack was released in February, and it can be viewed on their website.  The English language manga is also available stateside from the publisher Vertical, and there\u2019s an OVA episode called Episode 0 that\u2019s not quite as good as the series, but it\u2019s about as good as a pilot episode can be.  I normally don\u2019t ever mention fan-made AMVs, but if you go on Youtube, there\u2019s an AMV set to the song Safety Dance that provides a much better preview for the series than you\u2019re likely to find anywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, it just occurred to me that in my review of Nichijou, I spent three whole paragraphs not talking about Nichijou.  You could probably write this off as an accident, but it really wasn\u2019t.  I had to go abstract in order to set up my thoughts on the series, because, well, good comedy is really hard to talk about at length.  All you can really do is say it was hilarious, then spoil all the good gags, which is something I tried to do as little as possible, because Nichijou is almost all gags, and you really need to go in blind to enjoy them.  I guess if there\u2019s anything left to talk about, it\u2019s the wide appeal.  Pretty much anyone can enjoy this show, and yet it\u2019s completely safe for younger audiences.  There\u2019s no fanservice, there\u2019s no attempt at titillation...  I mean, there\u2019s a porno joke, but it\u2019s no worse than the one from Ed, Edd and Eddy.  There\u2019s a couple of questionable lessons, but they\u2019re few and far between.  Honestly, this is probably the first slice-of-life anime I\u2019ve ever seen that had a ton of female characters, but not one instance of those same characters comparing or getting jealous of each other\u2019s breast sizes, and that alone is a refreshing change of pace.  It\u2019s not perfect, and humor is subjective, but I can\u2019t think of anyone I wouldn\u2019t recommend this title to.  I give Nichijou a 9/10.",

            "content": "SHORT REVIEW\r\nCrazy fun to watch. This is not a typical slice of life series, but I think that's what makes it enjoyable to watch. This show is chock-full of intense sequences around simplistic situations. Mostly funny if you find humor relatable everyday situations or enjoy bizarre intensified awkwardness.\r\nWorth checking out if you are a fan of animation, or specifically Kyoto Animation Studio. It is a bit refreshing to see a show that purely embraces the art of animation and uses it with simple concepts to make a show with very little story entertaining. \r\nI enjoyed the show with my brain switched off. This is bestconsumed as a binge watch, while focusing on other things.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nLONG REVIEW\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nFrom a story perspective, this show is all over the place and has no structure, because of its randomness. Nichijou's randomness often means there is very little plot continuity, no over arcing series story lines or character development to care about. Nichijou's stories are based around light simplistic everyday humor that is hyper emphasized. Because of this, the show works best in a clip format or as nonsensical gifs that are purely visually pleasing. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a show that would also work better as a short 12-13 episode season/series with episodes running from 5-7 minutes in length. It makes no sense to create 20 min long episodes for a show made up of mostly unconnected stories. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I feel this is best watched in the background while you are doing other things. Don't waste your time trying to pay attention unless you want to watch something that is mindless fun. \\n\\n\\n\r\nART | ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe character design is alright, while the animation quality is impressive, and showcases moments of detailed physics, which is what I've come to expect from Kyoto Animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe hyper emphasis on normal insignificant everyday things is definitely what this show is known for. It can be humorous to see in motion, alongside very simplistic characters with very round and blocky designs. For myself, as an artist and animator I can appreciate Nichijou for its stylistic approach. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND | MUSIC\\n\\n\r\nFor animation in general, especially a show like this sound design is very important. The use of sound and music in Nichijou helps bring more of an impact to scenes/situations. Also noted: is the shows use of silence to help emphasize the hyper dramatic nature of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSo thumbs up for that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nI found all the characters to be fairly one note and similar. Simple minded characters who do and react to very relatable situations.\\n\\n\r\nThough there is very little to no character development...the characters serve their purpose in the way the show is set up.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show only when I switched my brain off. It is good to watch if you are in a bad mood or after watching something really dark and violent. Its light tone brings an occasional smile to my face. Though the shows 'humor\" didn't make laugh out loud, it did keep me smiling.\\n\\n\r\nNichijou is not something I could watch week to week, but best consumed as a binge watch, while focusing on other things.",

            "content": "This is my favorite comedy anime, and it will always be my favorite. 8/8. \r\nSince this is a slice of life, there is no definite story. However I'm giving it a 7 because they actually stuck with Mio having a crush on Sasahara and Nano having trouble with her key. \r\nArt fits the anime extremely well. Of course, this anime does not have outstanding art you'd find in a shoujo anime. However, when it comes to the comedic scenes, this anime does a wonderful job at portraying emotions and dramatic moments. \r\nSound is wonderful! Both OPs are incredibly catchy and fun. The first ED wasso sweet~ And the second EDs had me cracking up at every parody. Also, the OST fit the anime extremely well. From peaceful flute music to epic orchestral melodies, listening to the OST alone had me envisioning the certain scenes. They were very memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing. It's just that Hakase sometimes got so annoying... But that made it funnier in a sense, since she's so intelligent. Yuuko is hysterical (especially in the mosquito scene, I laughed so hard) and Mio is hilarious (her yaoi. Ahaha). Sakamoto will always be my favorite anime cat, he is such an awesome addition to the \"oh, Hakase is a little kid genius\" by calling her \"brat\" but getting blamed for all her mistakes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I absolutely LOVED this anime. I've watched it probably three times by now, and it has wonderful rewatch value. I recommend it to anyone who has some time to laugh. Everything in this anime joins together to form this brilliant masterpiece called \"Nichijou\". Even the title is funny once you start watching the anime! 10/10. \\n\\n",

            "content": "As with a lot of animes on MAL, the reviews tend to center around two distinct camps. \r\nThis anime is more glorious than Mikasa's ass \r\n       or \r\nit's the second coming of the anime Antichrist.\r\nNichijou is no exception to this rule.\r\nTo make it more simple, most people either give it a 10 or a 4.\r\nSo I'm gunna give you my totally honest review thing.\r\nStory: \r\nThe story of Nichijou is non-existent in effect. However, I think that's the point of it. It doesn't really strive to have continuation between episodes,  I can't mark it down for not doing somethingdeliberately, so I'll base this on more of a writing aspect. Nichijou can be funny, I would never disagree on that point but sometimes it fails.\\n\\n\r\nIt fails hard. \\n\\n\r\nI could find myself trawling through episodes, desperate to find the last crumb of a gag left on the plate. Nichijou had me in stitches from time to time, but not enough. I don't want to have to sit through 2 hours of overly moe little girls doing dumb, cringy stuff to get a chuckle (at the least).\\n\\n\r\nIt really was a double-edged sword, some episodes i'd give a 9 whereas some i'd give a 3. So I'll give it a 6\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (Writing) 6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: I actually liked the art of Nichijou, not because i'm some lolicon who gets off to eyes the size of grapefruits but because the style complimented the humor alongside the show. The varying styles mixed with various different tones, sometimes being polar opposites of each other; while this may seem strange, it worked well and the humor itself was bolstered by it.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I say nice things about the art, it wasn't some ground-breaking, artsy af show which left me speechless.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI actually love a lot of the sound aspects in Nichijou. The OP is catchy and encapsulates the fun atmosphere of the show, while the SFX of the show are very well done. To me, a good set of sounds is one where I don't notice any flaws. It all blended pretty seamlessly, with quite fitting ambient music dotted throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nI actually liked the characters. Robo-ho especially, although the wind up bullshit was annoying. They were all quirky, special characters who made me giggle every now and then. I honestly don't have the time or the willpower to do an in depth analysis of each character. In general, the spread of characters is well done, with a few being below par (being very annoying some times).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis is the hardest question of them all, but I think the point of Nichijou is simply for a laugh or too. I'll leave out the enjoyment rating because, well ... that is the overall rating for a show like this. All of the above factors, so graciously recommended by MAL really all translate into overall enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThis is most true with a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nPROS :\\n\\n\r\n- Some good gags, goofs and chuckles thrown in throughout\\n\r\n- Interesting characters\\n\r\n- Well integrated art style\\n\r\n- Good soundboard and OP\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\\n\r\n- Tries a bit too hard to be funny sometimes, and fails\\n\r\n- Some Japanese humor is lost on the English speakers (Con for English speakers only)\\n\r\n- Suffers badly from the 'Seth MacFarlane' style of long, drawn out jokes.\\n\r\n  This can explain better than I ever could \\n\r\n   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTgEJpWKGDE\\n\\n\r\n- A few occasionally annoying characters\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo overall i'd give it a 6.5 (verging on a 7), this show varies heavily in quality throughout. Its bearable on average, and good in its best. If you were to watch it, I'd recommend watching 1 episode every now and again, otherwise it'll run thin fast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThink my review is awful and you want to insult me about it, leave a comment on my profile x\\n\\n\r\nOr if you just wanna chat about the show i'm also there.\\n\\n\r\n-tpike1caesar\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The art was childish and not to my tastes, it was waaaay too random, although it gives me a few laughs every now and then but a lot of the time I'm just all \"wtf?\". I'm also the type of guy that likes comedy but doesn't really like slice of life. I only watched the first ten episodes or so once or twice every two weeks as some kind of relaxing break after school.\r\nEventually though it clung to me and really, I just binged watched from ep 15 untilthe end because it was just too good, and I was almost crying near the end that this masterpiece of an anime is only 26 episodes long. Oh, and I'm really confused and I'm thinking \"why is this anime so bad yet so mfking super ultra delicious wonderful good\". It's totally different from other anime I enjoy, but yeah. The time I wasted watching this anime was worth it.\\n\r\nI guess it's not for everybody. The art is leaning towards moe, but the animation is GOD. It's so smooth and well done which is a stark contrast to the moey art design of the anime. The OPs are good, well done, and really sets the theme of the wacky random school life of the characters, and has great music. The characters are not too bland and you'll get attached to a lot of them. Overall, really, this feeling of an anime being god-tier awesome is rare for me and even more surprising for me who much prefers adventures and great plot.",

            "content": "When it seemed that 2011 would be another year of generic romance comedies that reuse the same old plot lines and character archetypes over and over again, along came Nichijou with a surprisingly fresh and ultimately silly look at day to day life. This show was a gem from episode 1, and what made it so good was the sheer unpredictability of the show's plot. Everything that happens is random; as if someone played 'spin the bottle' with the plot since nothing happens which can be expected...most of the time. \r\n In essence this series seems to evoke the love-child of Azumanga and Zetsubou Senseiand as such Nichijou could probably be surmised as \"cute chaos\", since it seems to go for the Moe factor with its art and character design but keeping it elegantly simple without seeming childish and unapproachable, and creating a chaotic and unpredictable plot which uses facial expressions and character behaviour to exemplify the jokes. This may sound like an odd pairing and were they to present this idea to me originally I'd probably say that they mix like water and sand; it can be done but in the end you get mud and no one likes mud; but in this case they've managed to mix it together and create something totally unexpected, you could probably say that this is successful animation alchemy. The moe elements and the dark comedy mix surprisingly well and create an anime that is a lot more approachable than Zetsubou Sensei ever was (especially to foreigners).\\n\\n\r\nThe show has 5 main protagonists, Mio, Yuuko, Mai, Sakamoto (cat), the professor (7 year old kid) and Nano (robot created by the professor having an identity crisis). The show follows these main protagonists through their day to day lives in a format similar to Azumanga with incidental and trivial events that occur normally in every day life like dropping your favourite food item from your lunch box onto the floor and evoking the 3 second rule when you catch it just as it hits the ground, and turning them into ridiculous parodies of the real events by exaggerating the events considerably to hilarious effect.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's plot is deceptively simple and many of the events that occur in the series, while being ridiculously exaggerated, are reminiscent of the every day events that anyone might have experienced during their time at school. The characters are diverse and have a deceptive quality to them as they wear the mask of a common character archetype while under the surface they have a completely different take on that character for example: Mai fits into the archetype of the emotionless apathetic monotone girl that has become ever popular lately in anime comedies, while under that exterior she is a veteran prankster often taking every opportunity to pull a fast one on the people (and sometimes animals) around her. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as voice acting is concerned the main characters are well voiced and their behaviours and expressions as well as their outbursts and sudden accent changes truly show that they pushed the voice actors skills to the limit and produced a decent result. One thing is for certain, this show will never get an English dub, English voice actors tend to have problems expressing themselves properly when doing dub overs and this show is all expression 100% of the time. It didn't really work with Azumanga and it's level of expressive comedy was tame by comparison, thus they won't even attempt it in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's get to the important issue at hand that many of you may well have wondered about. \"If you have such high praise for it why did you drop it?\", well I think it's time to draw attention to the elephant in the room. This show is good, unique, new and fresh all of which get a thumbs up from me. Where I have a problem is with the progression in the series. While the jokes and ideas in this show are good after about episode 13, they start to run out of ideas and just repeat the old ones, and the problem with Nichijou is that unlike Azumanga their jokes aren't particularly intelligent and rely heavily on the unpredictability of the events in order to be funny, and while it's funny the first time it's not really that funny the second or third or fourth time. Once you take away the surprise and unexpected qualities of this series you're left with an anime that quickly falls into repetitive monotony.\\n\\n\r\nAs well as this, once Nano starts going to school the show starts to take on an episodic format and abandons it's old chaotic bit by bit structure. At this point it is important to make a quick distinction; while this show much like Azumanga Daioh focuses on the lives of a group of school girls, Azumanga's comedy is almost entirely character driven whereas this show is a straight up sitcom, every comedic moment in this show is based around the characters reaction to situations; and what makes this show funny is the variety of reactions they have to situations. It ceases to be funny when the characters use the exact same reaction over and over again to different situations. As such this show is a one time thrill and should ultimately have had only 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the 'my ordinary life' segments where funny the halvetica standard and short thoughts segments where not, halvetica standard in particular seemed to be trying too hard without really hitting the nail on the head. Short thoughts didn't really seem to have any comedic parts to it at all. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I really tried to get passed episode 20 but ultimately I got bored of the series  repetitiveness. That does not however overshadow the brilliance of the shows first half and you should definitely see it but like I said, you can only really find it funny after watching it once and then maybe again only once you've forgotten about it, which if you have a good memory....is a sad day for you. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Producers of sketch comedy shows (at the moment, the LIFE series on NHK and probably a couple of others on different networks) need to hire Keiichi Arawi nao. At least, before a rakugo comedian makes him an heir.\r\nWho else could come up with such a cute robot whose lifelong dream is to be a schoolgirl except for that giant wind-up key on her back?\r\nWho else could make such simple activities like Roshambo (rock-paper-scissors), Red Light-Green Light, or jump rope so hilariously ridiculous, or making a house of cards so dramatic (KyoAni topped this by doing it without any dialogue)?\r\nWho else could capture the essence ofa house cat primarily in dialogue?\\n\\n\r\nWho else could make \"Things we think are cool!\" into a delightful running gag?\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if the \"epic zeppelin\" sequences are in the original manga, but the comedic timing is simply genius in all three instances, even if after you see the first one.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I generally don't give 10 ratings to comedies, mostly because you inevitably have to mess with the story at hand in order to deliver a punch line, or you have to go with a structure that makes deep storytelling all but impossible. In a drama, \"nothing is sacred\" will eventually destroy the plot, characters, theme, and the production itself (hint, hint, Grancrest), but the freedom to find laughter even in the darkest and holiest of places is essential to comedy. Now, the sketches in Nichijou typically don't go longer than half an episode, but when there's a long story, it's got all the tension of a good drama even if it's the setup to a punch line and little more.\\n\\n\r\nLater in the series (when the opening theme changes), the material started to lose its shine for me. Sure, Nano got to become a high school girl, and many sketches now put her in the same situations as Mio, Yukko, and Mai, but it felt like the show was scraping the bottom of the barrel... At least, until another near-silent sketch with Mio and Yukko split my sides.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the visual animation, while staying very true to Arawi's original designs, is amazingly good. At first it seems like a typical KyoAni moe show. But when you start to get into the physical comedy, the visual timing of each slapstick gag is just about perfect. Take the first big slapstick sequence. Not only is the initial explosion beautifully detailed, they take the time to slow the action so that you can see 3 seemingly random objects sent airborne by the explosion, along with a few thousand more random things like a moai. Right when Yukko says something that practically invites Murphy's Law, BANG, each object hits her.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the situations would have those who can't take an anime joke going \"WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT IN SCHOOL!?!?\", so this anime is perfect for winding such people up.",

(Needs a 2nd- 5th season). It has everything you could want from an anime. I will admit the \"slice of life\" tag is a bit of a stretch so if you want a true to name, genuine SOL go watch Non Non Biyori (another favorite of mine). But if you want to laugh and aww and get hyped over a damn well animated show with some action scenes thatput some modern shounen to shame. This show never lets up with enjoyment and overall good times, sure it's not all fall out of your seat humor and every 5 seconds isn't a gag like some other comedy anime, which I think makes this show a bit more likable. It doesn't try hard when it doesn't need to and lets you enjoy the peaceful moments between some of the characters before throwing you back in the frying pan of absurdity. It's a perfect anime, that was undoubtedly ahead of its time which led to it mediocre reception, and further neglect as a series. I will always hold some shred of hope in my heart the series will live on in some way or another. Selemat Pagi!",

Up until Episode 12 I really thought I would give it 10/10.\r\nThe second half was the total opposite. It became unfunny, unoriginal, the jokes were for the most part forced. This is mainly due (but not only) to Hakase, who is an unoriginal and annoying character in an anime full of original and interesting characters. This would've been fine if she had been a side character, unfortunately they suddently decided to give us more of her even thougheveryone prefers Mai/Mio/Yuuko.\\n\\n\r\nHakase is an interloper that is to me the most at fault for the mediocrity of the second half.\\n\\n\r\nThere was also all of this romance crap near the end, with Mio/Misato and Sasahara. I really don't understand why they did that. Not needed at all, and very sudden.\\n\\n\r\nIt feels like a waste to give it 6/10, but I simply can't ignore half of the episodes, I wouldn't be objective otherwise.",

            "content": "May contain spoilers.\r\nWell, I can only say that this anime is what you call \"normal\" at all xD. Leaving jokes aside, Nichijou is a wonderful slice-of-life anime in which two groups of people live their daily lives in a totally absurd, surreal, humorous way as possible.\r\nThe story is focused on two groups consisting of Mai, Yukko, and Mio in the first group and in the other hand consists of Nano, Hakase, and Sakamoto. These two groups have lived there totally surreal lives together and maybe forever. Although, there is not much plot to it because it is a slice-of-life anime, we can sense through oureyes and ears on how entertaining this anime really is. There is only one problem though, and maybe, this is a serious one concerning the anime. I did not really like the fact that part concerning about Nano... Well, few people might notice this fact, but I won't spoil anymore than this. Anyone who read this, just go on.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning about the artwork and sound, I can say that there are really spot on. I just love the synergy between the cutesy artwork of Professor and the shocked expression of Yuuko(because of Mai) in this overall anime. The OP sounds really, really addicting with the animations and music going on. Lastly, the overall animation fits so well with the expressions of the Principal, Yuuko, Mio, and Sakamoto especially when they go totally nuts on what they believe is not normal concerning on what the actual crap is happening around them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters also blends well to each other like a retort to a joke. Even though they are not perfect on what I can see because of some personality shifts during a scene, I can say that they are quite appealing and definitely not forgettable at all. The jokes totally helps the fact that the anime characters really are memorable. \\n\\n\r\n  I can say that the enjoyment I have to this anime is really high that I wished that there is a second season(I hope). It is not just damn enough at all. Overall, I can say that this anime is not perfect, but everything else makes up for it. I highly recommend this to the people who are up to things like surreal humor then go watch it too. :D\\n",

The two groups are tied together by Hakase's android, Nano, who is functionallya normal human except for the giant wind up key sticking out of her back and the occasional odd devices that Hakase builds into her arms. The series follows Nano as she tries to be normal in suburban Japan, while Yuko, Mio, and Mai play off each other's personalities and live their lives as (mostly) normal high school girls.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of progression of story, this is no Lucky Star or Azumanga. You aren't watching these girls grow up and eventually graduate High School. The focus is mainly on Nano as she seeks to be accepted as normal, and her struggle is the emotional heart of the series. The rest of the series is comedic sketches as all the characters interact with their mostly normal town, populated by poorly drawn animals, super aggressive deer, and indestructible watermelons. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is certainly absurd at times but it has a genuine sense of comedy and heart and is good for a laugh. Unfortunately it seems a little hard to get a hold of on any streaming service and you're going to have to track down disks.",

Hilarious, cute, relaxing, and maybe a little unnerving, it's more of a skit comedy with recurring characters. \r\nThat being said, I can imagine some unfortunate soul would not be able to find it funny. It's got someplain confusing parts that might just make you laugh only out of confusion, though that never happened with me. On top of being hilarious, this is one of the best shows to just relax and watch. Good vibes just keep flowing. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the relaxed setting, the animation is always impressive and lively.

            "content": "To me, Nichijou is a stellar animation, because it accomplished whatever it wanted to be and in all the right ways. Sure, it might not have the deepest of plots, but it\u2019s a winner in my eyes.\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the story first. Nichijou is a slice-of-life plus comedy anime, and like all others, it is meant to be light-hearted, fun and entertaining to watch. It was ironic that each animation section was titled \u201cMy Ordinary Life Part __\u201d when honestly, their daily life is anything BUT ordinary. You have a genius kid scientist who loves shark chocolate, a talking cat, a robot who goes toschool with a screw on her back AND NO ONE QUESTIONS HER ABOUT IT at least not outwardly, school girls running in between trains, and a boy who has a mohawk against his will because, poor thing, his hair only grows like that. And that\u2019s just the people. Their daily situations and mishaps are even more bizarre. One of the things that makes the show so entertaining to watch is the way ordinary situations escalate into totally crazy and hilarious events.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I absolutely love about this anime is the many, many slices of animation in each episode. There are random shorts slipped in between scene changes and they are always adorable. The \u2018short thoughts\u2019 section is like reading a sentence or two from a diary, very simple and short narrations, but they are pensive, a little bit wistful and a refreshing break from the sometimes ultra fast-paced action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe sense of humour might be an acquired taste to some, it\u2019s a sort of slapstick mix with \u2018this-is-funny-cos-its-so-damn-weird\u2019 mix with overt exaggeration and dramatization. But I think most people would find it funny. There were times when I burst out laughing and had to run to my sister\u2019s room with my laptop and force her to watch it, and start laughing all over again. However, there were also times when the jokes flew right over my head and I just sat there stone-faced. I have a feeling some of these jokes are related to the Japanese language itself, and even culture, of which I am not aware of and probably only Japanese people would understand.\\n\\n\r\nNow, about the animation. I have nothing bad to say about the animation, it was PERFECT. So super good, and a treat to watch and some scenes were done in different styles which was so fun to watch. The main style is very well-done too, with its clean colors and very clean drawing. The music complemented the scenes and movements perfectly too so no complaints there either. The second opening scene is amazing; it\u2019s a non-stop rollercoaster ride of animation and lively music that harmonize and fit together soooo well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to end off, a quote from the show itself:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cOur everyday lives may in fact, be a series of miracles.\u201d\\n\r\n- Nichijou\\n\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: Your go-to if you\u2019re in the mood for some energetic and light-hearted slice-of-life anime. This is probably one of the very best of the genre.",

Nichijou's storyline is sporadic, which is fun for the most part but can get a little boring. One thing I didn't like much was the large amount of cutscenes where nothing was happening - you'd just see the logo or a view of a building. I find these irritatingly dull and I think Nichijou would be much better without them. \r\nArt: 9\r\nNichijou's art is really something. The colours are soft and pretty and the characters just look awesome! I love theart style and i've never really watched anything with art quite like it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nNichijou's theme song and music just isn't really the genre for me.

Its only weakness is that sometimes it can be a little TOO simple!",

It is not just some boring and ordinary slice of life, as you find some crazy situations the characters are put in, which are definitely bound to be hilarious and enjoyable. \r\nThe art style of this series is great, as it's all very high quality, and there are not very many flaws to be found. \r\nThe soundtrack ofthis is excellent, a lot of it has a good variety to it, and this makes for the soundtrack to be incredibly enjoyable to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all unique and show very interesting personality types. Some are rather odd, like a few will hardly do anything, or behave in very oddball behaviors, which makes for some real interesting situations, as their quirks show up at the most unexpected times. This makes for some very hilarious situations at times. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor is very good if you understand the humor of it all.

Because I don't want to disclose certain scenes of the anime, its absurd craziness also makes it hard to review, but I'll do my best.\r\nTo me, Nichijou stands apart from all other slice-of-life anime (at least the ones I've seen) because it addresses daily life scenarios, like other slice-of-life anime, while spicing it up with shounen-style animation, over-the-top acting, or strange deliverance of the content. Besides daily life scenarios, Nichijou also introduces strange side stories thatdon't seem relevant to its genre, which is interesting considering its anime category.\\n\\n\r\nIt's such a shame that it didn't so well in Japan, and while I think I understand the reason, I still think it's a shame. In short, Nichijou is a hilarious, unique slice-of-life anime, and I highly recommend it.",

A great cast of characters for a comedy with one potential scrappy that sometimes detracts from the comedy, but not enough to derail the show.  Highly enjoyable and memorable with great re-watch value.\r\n-Details-\r\nStory: 8\r\nGenres: Comedy, School, Slice of Life\r\nThemes: Absurdity, Sketch Comedy, Moe\r\nThe overall structure of this show is episodic, and the episodes themselves are very sporadic.  You'll often see cuts from one scene to another rather quickly and sometimes randomly.  Theshow also has many elements which act as 2-5 minute short segments, like \"Helvetica Standard,\" which is basically animated 4-panel comics which uses different characters than the main cast to tell quick jokes.  These are often interspersed with the main events of the episode and seemingly appear with completely random timing.  \\n\r\nI think this way of constructing episodes works well for this series.  The main selling point of this show is that it is absurd sketch comedy and the near absurdity of the scene transitions themselves reinforce this feeling in the show.  Sometimes in the middle of a scene the camera will simply cut away and show some random building, and then cut right back to the original scene, all of this occurring for seemingly no reason, and yet it works as a transition for this show and can even be funny in itself.\\n\r\nThis is a slice of life, so there is mostly no plot.  The only thing which might be called a plot is the robot girl, Nano, wants to go to school and basically live the life of a normal girl.  The main thing holding her back is the professor who designed her, who adds all sorts of crazy things to Nano's design, like a large screw in her back, or rocket toes.  The irony in all of this is that Nano is one of the most normal characters in this show and everything around her is absurd.  As far as I can tell, this is the only element of the story which moves things along, otherwise this is mostly just absurd comedy set in high school.\\n\r\nOne last comment on the structure of this story: for the first half of the series it is largely divided into two parts, the school lives of: Mio, Yuko, and Mai, and the home lives of Nano, the professor, and a cat named Sakamoto.  These are mostly separate but start to converge about halfway through the show.  The convergence doesn't change the feel of the show too much so that's all I will say about it.\\n\r\nIn my opinion, most of the comedy in this show is pure gold.  I happen to like absurdity and find it amusing.  If you do too, then you really shouldn't miss out on this show.  The main reason I take off points for story is that some of the scenes with Nano and the professor really shift the feel of the show temporarily.  They tend to focus more on moe and less on comedy and thus can be kind of boring if that's not your thing.  This show succeeds most as comedy, so when it kind temporarily departs from this in these scenes, it doesn't work as well.  However, it is not a game changer.  You might find yourself wishing these scenes would just go away, but only because the rest of the show is so brilliant and hilarious by comparison.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nStudio: Kyoto Animation\\n\\n\r\nIf you're familiar with Kyoto Animation, then you're probably aware that they tend to have high quality art and animation.  This series doesn't look the same as many of their other popular works, like Clannad or The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.  In fact, the art in this show is fairly unique among KyoAni anime.  Overall it is very high quality art and animation.  Motions are often very fluid, especially in scenes where they play up intensity and over-the-top reactions for laughs.  It is a delight to watch.  The character designs are pretty simple, but effective for this kind of show, and the characters themselves look unique enough to be easily identifiable.  The supporting cast has some really amusing character designs, including a character with an absurdly large afro, and another guy with a crazy blonde mowhawk.  It's also pretty clear who is a teacher/adult and who is a student.  I was especially impressed with the designs of the principal and vice principal because they actually look 50-60 years old.\\n\r\nBackgrounds, building architecture, and such other things look good.  Since this show mostly focuses on characters, these things aren't always crucial.  Nevertheless, care is given to them and they typically look very good, better than they need to.  No complaints here.\\n\r\nOne thing that definitely stands out with this show is how much the art shifts based on the situation.  In intense scenes, there are more intense colors and more sharp lines to emphasize something like an intense emotion or intense pain.  Sometimes the character designs will temporarily shift to effectively portray a feeling like a stone-faced look or something of that sort.  What surprised me is that there is actually no use of the chibi style even though that is pretty common in comedies.  Whatever art-style is being used, it is all very high quality.  In my opinion, every shift of the art style is highly effective and I was very impressed with how much the art enhances the comedy and mood of the show.\\n\r\nOverall the art in this show is extremely appealing to look at and is very memorable.  High quality stuff here--even if you're not necessarily a fan of comedy, you could probably watch this show for the art and still enjoy it or at least get something out of it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nI can pretty much sing the same praises of the sound as I did the art.  The voice acting is brilliant overall.  Mio and Yuko sound over-the-top when they need to, they sound cute when they need to, etc.  Yuko's voice actress in particular did this thing where she lowered the pitch of her voice when she was either freaking out or surprised by something.  You yourself would be surprised how much this adds to the comedy.  Mai is the straight-man of the group and her voice suits this role well, mostly being monotone but having enough inflection and emotion to be effective.  The professor sounds like a little kid, and she is, so overall her voice is appropriate.  The voice actress did a good job of having her sound whine-y when she needed to.  Similar things can be said for the rest of the cast.  There are no bad performances here.\\n\r\nThe sound effects are also really good.  These mostly come into play when there are things like collisions, usually between some character and the ground, and also when things are dropped or hit other things.  Whenever they are needed, they sound realistic and aid in immersion.  There is a scene at a shrine where many sound effects come into play, like wood breaking, stepping in something soft and gooey, coins dropping on the floor, etc; these all sound good and I have no complaints.\\n\r\nThe music probably aids in the comedy as much as the art style does.  There aren't any tracks that I would necessarily go back and listen to just for the sake of listening to music, but this is no problem.  The music aids in the comedy in a way similar to how music helped a show like Tom and Jerry.  Timing is everything and in Nichijou they have the timing down well.  Moments of intensity have appropriately intense chords in the background, things like that.  Additionally, the opening and ending themes are very good and very memorable.  See them for yourself.  They are some of my favorites from a comedy series because they simply work so well, especially the opening themes, for a comedy series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a cast of characters well-suited to comedy.  Yuko fulfills a funny-man role, Mai a straight-man role, and Mio is sometimes one, sometimes the other.  Each character is designed well for the roles given to them.  The characters aren't realistic or super fleshed-out/developed or anything, but they don't need to be.  They have extremely likable personalities and succeed as comedic characters.  Mai in particular is somehow able to be the straight-man while simultaneously contributing to a lot of the absurdity of the show.  The rest of the cast is full of amusing characters as well, who don't get the most screen time but can nonetheless really stick out and be memorable, like the afro guy or the mowhawk guy or some of the teachers/the principal.  \\n\r\nOne character in this show has the potential to be the Scrappy, and that is the professor.  In general she is not a funny character, and seems to mostly be there for moe instead of comedy.  She does have some amusing moments, and the design choices she makes concerning Nano are often pretty funny, but most of the time she acts like an annoying child and this is intended to be cute.  It is also perhaps supposed to be funny, but I personally think the professor does not succeed well as a comedic character.  She feels out of place in the absurd atmosphere and sometimes derails the feel of the show.  If you're not a fan of moe, this character could potentially detract from your enjoyment quite a bit whenever she gets on screen.  But if you're okay with occasional breaks from the comedy and moe is enjoyable to you, then maybe this character won't be a problem for you.\\n\r\nOverall this cast is full of strong personalities who are enormously funny.  The only exception is the professor who is pretty hit or miss; and whether you end up liking her or not, there is no denying that her character in a sense the oddball of the group in that she isn't as funny as the others and is more of a moe character than a comedic one.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 / Overall: 9\\n\\n\r\nOf course everyone's taste in comedy is different, so this is pretty subjective.  However, I would say that this show succeeds spectacularly in what it is trying to be, and that is absurd sketch comedy.  If this is something you have enjoyed in the past, then there is no reason why you wouldn't enjoy it in this show.  In my opinion, the only thing about this show which deviates from this general description are some of the scenes with Nano and the professor.  It sometimes feels like the comedy comes to a halt in order to make room for some moe elements which really don't need to be in the show from a comedic perspective.  However, these scenes, which really aren't more than 5% of the show tops, are not enough to derail the show--overall the show is still a great success in the comedy/slice of life department.  \\n\r\nOne thing that I greatly appreciated is that there is no fan-service/sexualization of the characters.  This is decently popular in comedy but this show is able to succeed without that, which is a big plus for some and definitely a big plus for me.\\n\r\nIt's hard to say if I would recommend this to a non-anime fan or not.  There is definitely a lot of weirdness, but the weirdness isn't necessarily Japan-specific.  I would say that if you know a friend who is a fan of comedy then this might actually be something they can enjoy even if they haven't seen a lot of anime.  This show also has a high re-watch value.  There is such great diversity of comedy that even on a re-watch most of it still feels fresh and hilarious.  Overall this is a very memorable comedy series and in my opinion it contains some of the best comedic elements of any anime I've seen.",

            "content": "Nichijou...\r\nWhat can i say about this anime...I remember i started this anime few years ago but i didn't really pay attention to it. I completely forgot about it (after 6 or 7 episodes). But recently i decided to continue the anime. So here goes my review: \r\nSTORY (7)\r\nIt's a serie of short stories, sometimes it has a continuation in the next episodes, sometimes there is not and it's perfectly fine. If half of the time i was able to guess what was going to happen, i was enjoying the other half of time where i was completely surprised by the conclusion of the little stories.\\n\\n\r\nART (7) \\n\r\nSimple. Colorful. Original. I really appreciated it. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND (6) \\n\r\nI don't especially remember any of the sounds. Maybe the first opening that i liked more than the second one. I think i just didn't pay attention to the music.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (10)\\n\r\nEach character has a ''special'' personality. Some clich\u00e9, some very outstanding. \\n\r\nI especially liked the main trio (Yukko, Mio and Mai). Yukko, the idiot of the group, Mio, the artist and more serious one, and Mai the...whatever she is! I mean...she is just strange. And if you watch the anime, you will understand. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (7)\\n\r\nI watched maybe 2 or 3 episodes per day. It was my relax moment. Having a good laugh and then go do other things. Because, that is what this anime is. No ''storyline'' just enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (7)\\n\r\nI would say it's not the anime of the year for me, but it was really enjoyable. Not having to think of anything and just watch all the outstanding characters living their crazy lives.",

I didn't want to watch it before because the art style didn't really fit to my liking that much. However, it's really worth it. It's short stores in each episode work really well together. Not to mention it doesn't seem as if there's a plot. However, There's hints of plots here and there and is resolved nicely by the end of the series.\r\nOn top of that I REALLY appreciate the animation in this. Normally crack anime doesn't have the best animation and its more onfunny jokes. However, Nichijou has AMAZING animation. As an art student I can reassure you on that. It's almost up to movie standards. The dynamics are done so well that it makes your eyes glued to the screen. The voice acting goes PERFECTLY with all the scenes and EVERY scene which makes it SO FUNNY. All the scenes have their lameness and you want to look away, but you can't because it feels like if you don't keep watching you'll miss out. I mean this is the only series which I've watched it over 7 times. If you're not watching it, you're seriously missing out! ^^\\n",

When I first saw this anime was going to judge, I thought that this will be a stupid, non relating, random show like Lucky Star(did not like it). The story line is very wonderful, heart warming, has some violence and explosions to give you that \"umph\" of everything. It's funny, lots of action, and a bit mecha in it, you'll see if you watch/ed it. \r\n The sound of it is practically amazing. The explosions really sound like they are coming through your speakers. \r\n I loved theart in this anime. It was spectacular, they tried lots of different ways of art designs. Their faces, background, explosions, even the sky was phenomenon. It took my breath away. For the characters, I love them all!!! They are so funny. I really don't want to spoil anything on who they are but I am pretty sure that everyone can mostly assure that many will enjoy the characters.\\n\\n\r\n The only negative thing will probably the ending, it gives you the \"so what happens now\" feeling and it bums me out when mostly all anime's do that and doesn't have a sequal after that but overall I bet you will be very pleased! ;)",

            "content": "what can i say about this anime it is actually one of the few comedy animes where i have laughed they featured some great jokes in there i can say right now that u will laugh every episode \r\nSTORY\r\nThe basic premise behind Nichijou is...that there isn't any premise at all. What the show likes to do is present the viewer with our \"main\" cast (Yukko, Mio, Mai, and Nano) in a variety of different situations ranging from stuck elevators to getting bit in the hand by a dog. Each may last for 20 seconds or go as long as seven minutes or so, but anytime in-between is perfectly valid. Sure, some of the small arcs are interconnected in small ways (such as a running bike from the previous short zooms by during the middle of the next), but most of these small stories are completely random and usually unrelated to anything else that has occurred. There are other supporting characters as well (too many to list) and they too are apart, either alone or with each other, in the zany and crazy stories that are told.\\n\r\nIs this a bad thing? Surprisingly no. It fits the show very well, and allows for you to just enjoy the moment for what it is. It was kind of interesting not having to worry about characters developing through drama or having a comprehensive world that fit the narrative, all of which was done quite on purpose. The chopped-up way in which everything is presented just adds to the hilarity and craziness of the entire show.\\n\\n\r\n Animation \\n\\n\r\nFrom an outside perspective, one may think that the show is quite plain looking. And to a degree, that person would be correct. However, when you start actually watching the show do you realize how everything is actually extremely well animated. This is especially true for those over-the-top moments. The show does a fantastic job in terms of showing off effects, character movements, and background/foreground happenings. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\n This section is difficult. For this type of show, I think everyone going in knows not to expect anything growth-wise with the characters. After all, it is, at its core, a comedy. As such, it really comes down to whether the person watching really loves the characters or not.\\n\\n\r\n ENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\n I have to reiterate to get the point across: you have to like random, you absolutely have to like over-the-top, in order to enjoy the show and its type of comedy. Luckily, I am pretty easy to get a laugh out of, so for the majority of the show, I was doing just that.",

It reminds me a lot of the newer Yuyushiki.  It has pretty much the same art style, and witty humor that they both do very well.   It was incredibly funny watching them hitting each other, and other surprises that you don't expect.  If your looking for an anime with story, this isn't something you should watch.  If your looking for good, short, humor, then watch this right now.  \r\nStory was fair, it wasn't terrible, but there wasn't any reallythere to begin with.  Its just random, and all over the place. Your shown different parts of different people's lives, that somehow relate to other peoples lives. its great to spot out characters from other characters story parts.(this anime is split into over 100 parts.)\\n\\n\r\nArt was very good.  It best showed when something was suppose to be funny, when something was suppose to be serious, and when characters were worried, freaking out, spazzing out, or just plain, out of it.\\n\\n\r\nSound was good, because each little thing had its own sound effect.  when one character was worried, there would be little water droplets coming out of their head and you would hear the little \"pleak pleak\" sound, and it was quite entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a lot! of characters.  And i mean a lot. of characters.  There were about 6 main ones that you see most of the time, but there are a lot more than that.  each one having their pretty much own story part.  As I said above, since their in the same town, you get little bits of where you see someone from another story part, and its fun to point them out.\\n\\n\r\nIf i said I enjoyed it, then that would be an understatement.   This anime was incredibly funny and the jokes and witty retorts were what made it really great to watch.  Its almost as if it were a japanese type family guy, but with a  million times more randomness, jokes, and retorts.\\n\\n\r\nOverall its somthing for the ones seeking humor.  Its not really great story wise, but it doesn't need that.  it makes up for the story in that it has tons and tons of jokes, and retorts.  I say retorts, because theres more funny retorts than there are jokes.  And if you don't know what a retort is, look it up.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to anyone who wants a funny anime to watch.  Watching them do Rock Paper Scissors is fun too :D",

It's overall well done, but the humor is so dry and Japanese and often just lame, that 26 episodes resembles, as Bilbo said, 'butter scraped over too much bread'. A very funny 5 or 9 episode series could probably be made out of it (although I do appreciate the finishing episode).But 26 is just too much!",

            "content": "Nichijou\r\n   What can I say about Nichijou but that it is near flawless. In my time of watching anime and the comedy genre, Nichijou is something VERY special. With an appealing art style, smooth and sexy animations, well timed gags and characters glowing with personality, this anime is perfect for if you are looking for something fun and over the top. How about we break this apart bit by bit. \r\nStory: 6\r\nNichijou presents us with a story by giving us no story. Yep, there is no story to this. The story is really just the high-jinks of people and their lives with awhole lot of over exaggeration sprinkled on it. However we do follow two particular groups of friends. The first being there high school girls known as Yuuko Aioi, Mai Minakami, and Mio Naganohara. The second group is a little bit more diverse and consists of an 8-year old professor known as Hakase (Shinonome), her robot adorable Nano Shinonome and a talking cat called Sakamoto. There's not much to say about the story other than it leads to these two groups crossing paths with each other. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art is very stellar but simple. It could be a bit or miss for people to be honest. The simplicity could captivate you or it could turn you away however, it cannot be denied that simplicity of the art style allowed for some gorgeous animations. Just look at the opening (see here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YfF7HqZm_vA) and see how smooth it is. In fact Nichijou's opening is rather famous for its beautiful zoom in on each character leading to another. With the charming simplicity and amazing animation, the art was a hit for me. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe sound is great with the music and voice acting being some of the best any comedy has to offer. The openings Kakakata Kataomoi, Hyadain no Joujou Yuujou and Zzz are some of my favorite songs and do a fantastic job just making you feel good. The voice acting done by everyone is so great and it compliments the humor and gags. Its pretty solid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThe characters is a very strong aspect of this show. They flow with personality and it's fun to watch them. It's not anything ground breaking but it works perfectly. Yuuko is lazy and childish, Mio is carefree and cheerful and Mai is dead pan but she is out to troll and play tricks on her friends. This trio plays off of each other well. On the other side we have Hakase, a smart 8-year old who invents things yet despite her being a professor she acts her age. We have Nano, a robot who longs to be a normal person and Sakamoto who gets caught up in the trouble Nano Hakase get into. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI'll be honest. Due to the randomness of this show, you'll either love it or hate it. The jokes will more than likely be a miss if you lack knowledge of Japanese culture. Even if you do have a decent understanding, you'll miss a few jokes. The solo and doppio joke is one example one might not understand. In my own view, there was not a single moment where I was bored. I enjoyed the fun and loud nature of the characters, the jokes made me laugh a lot more than other comedies and each episode left me wanting to go on to the next episode. By the end I was satisfied with it all. It wasn't too short and it has a lot of reasons to rewatch. It all depends on preferences. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI can't help but say this is a near perfect comedy anime. As I stated before, the characters are fun, the gags are well timed and the animation is smooth. If you are looking for a random but jolly good time, look no further than Nichijou. It is a good time.",

            "content": "Not all good anime have good plots. Nichijou is an example of an anime that I considered good even though the plot is not that developed.\r\nSo here's Nichijou. It is a comedic slice of life anime that shows the every day life of its characters. It starts with a lively opening song then a barrage of comedic segments that ends with a good ending theme song. Imagine yourself after finishing a 26-episode laughter-packed series and you can't deny the fact that you truly laughed the hell out of you. Well for me, I did find the anime amazing that I can't take the absence ofa well developed plot against Nichijou. Making the statement more justifiable, what keeps you watching a certain anime is the plot, right? One keeps on watching to find out how the plot progresses from one episode to another. Hence, a good plot is important. Anime like Nichijou answers a different burden. You can ask yourself, \"How will you keep on watching a series without a concrete plot?\", Nichijou can do it. It has a successful execution in terms of barraging the viewers of comedic scenes that the viewers will expect more episodes to laugh at. Personally, I had this kind of attachment to the anime that I felt no fulfillment in finishing Nichijou (that feeling that you want more episodes like yeah). Yeah, I somehow understand those plot-wise viewers for the lack of substantiation of the plot.  I recommend this anime to those who are big fans of comedy. That's Nichijou for you. It is good as it is.",

            "content": "Beautiful. Absolutely great. As you may be able to tell, this is my favorite anime of all time- more than DBZ, or Kill la Kill, or JJBA, or anything else I claim to like. This anime is fairly underrated, but I won't say no one has heard of it. This is one of those reviews that you read to see if you'd like the show. But, you may already know what I'm going to say. There will me minor spoilers. So, lets go over each point, and see why Nichijou is the best anime ever created by man.\r\n/STORY- 10 OUTTA 10\\\r\nNow, the slice of lifegenre is one that has always been very controversial in some aspects. Shows like Lucky Star and Yuru Yuri (these are the main ones I have seen/liked the most)  have been debated for years. I myself will say they are decent, not the best genre I enjoy- I prefer more of the action-y stuff. BUT I also love the comedy genre, more than the SoL genre. \\n\\n\r\nThis show combines all 3. This show is about nothing- but it isn't a bad nothing, like K\u00e4mpfer, which had no story. It doesn't make the show trashy or bad. Each episode is 24 minutes long but they are full of segments that are only a few minutes each. Like I said, I feel there isn't much story for me to talk about, but I'll try.\\n\\n\r\nWe follow the everyday life (that's what Nichijou means) of several group of people. And, each character is just as interesting as the last. Unlike some SoL genre, it doesn't make you go, \"come on, come on, get on with it\" by dragging the story. This show wouldn't have work without it's short runtime. And as much as it's \"everyday life\" it's really... not. But it's good that way.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the ending was one of the best anime endings I have ever seen. Plenty anime, especially ones adapted from manga, have pretty crappy endings. \\n\\n\r\n/ART- 9 OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this show fit it well. It was simple, and not bright- it didn't need to be for the story to be interesting. And it's great- all the characters are designed well, and the art is fluid. And it's perfect for capturing the weird scenarios this show creates. The art looks real. Well by that I don't mean real as in it takes place in real life, but there isn't any weird hair color or zany outfits that a lot of (yes even SoL) anime has. Again, I feel it worked well. It was normal, but it wasn't. \\n\\n\r\nNote: Something I'll go into more depth later was how this show flopped financially. One of the reasons it didn't appeal to the market may have been nothing was over sexuallized or had fan service. And it didn't need it.\\n\\n\r\n/SOUND- 9 OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP for this show was great. Every anime must have some kind of downfall one way or another- that's an exaggeration, since I really liked the first OP, but it had to grow on my a while for me to like it. The first ED was also great. It wasn't as 'action-packed' per say, but it showed you \"Show's over until next time\".\\n\\n\r\nI think I had liked the second OP much better. Still suiting the mood of the show, it showed how there was going to be more character development and the characters would meet each other in the second half. The second ED was visual wise, beautiful. I cried when it played on the last episode.\\n\\n\r\n/CHARACTER- 10 OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Nichijou are one of the things it excels in. Like I said, none of the designs are that typical, but at the same time, they are if you look at it from a more realistic perspective. All the characters were likeable, and I can't go over them all since there are so many introduced in every episode.\\n\\n\r\nYUUKO: Though this show technically doesn't have one, I guess she could be considered the main character. She was a good MC- it kept things interesting, since she did have flaws.\\n\\n\r\nMIO: Mio was one of my favorite characters in this show. I think she was the funniest out of the main 3. \\n\\n\r\nMAI: For a while I actually I had her name mixed up with Mio's lol. This character was also a very likeabke one. This show has a wide variety of characters, and this was one of them.\\n\\n\r\nNANO: Nano is a robot. She's the one with the key sticking out of her back in all the promotional art. She could also be considered part of the really main characters, but it might be a stretch. \\n\\n\r\nSAKAMOTO: This character is the talking cat. He's like the most sarcastic one (and smartest in plenty instances). He was one of my favorite characters too.\\n\\n\r\nHAKASE: Literally translating to \"Professor\" Hakase was my favorite character in the series. The episodes she was in, I feel, were the better ones.\\n\\n\r\n/ENJOYMENT- 10 OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show, that is great, no matter what. You don't have to be watching it with friends, or by yourself. The show isn't dirty at all, and it doesn't have many flaws. I think the only was you might NOT be able to enjoy it is if it just 'isn't your thing' which I can see plenty of people feeling that way. Now, I don't know much about TV channels (I don't watch TV 99% of the time) but I could picture this gong on an adult OR kids network, since I feel both audiences could enjoy it. I'd show this show to people who haven't even seen any anime, and I don't mean as a gateway anime. I mean just to watch. You don't have to like anime to enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nYesidoreccomendit\\n\\n\r\n/OVERALL- 11 OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\nSo, apparently, this show made like, no money. Which means no season 2. Every year  there seems to be a new overhyped anime, and idk why it isn't one of them. I haven't really seen this anime get much hate either. So idk really why it did horribly. Overall, this show is the pinnacle of the anime industry, maybe not in everyone's eyes, but in mine.\\n\\n\r\nGood day. And go watch Nichijou. I hope you enjoyed my review!",

            "content": "I never thought I'd see a Bill Watts reference in a modern anime.\r\nStory:\r\nNichijou is mostly an episodic comedy, but there are little stories being told. Nanos struggle with her robotic identity, Nakamura trying to catch her, Misatos crush on Sasahara, Mios drawings and quite a few more. This is a pretty cool mixture that not only gives you tons of sketches but also makes you interested in (and hopefully care about) the characters. Most things are wrapped up in the final episode (more or less). I wish some characters got more focus, but the diversity makes for a very entertaining watch.\r\n9/10\r\nArt:\r\nSimplistic as in other comediesmost of the time, but we get some art shift every now and then. I still think simplicity is the best choice for a pure comedy and Nichijou reassures me in that opinion. I especially loved the parts were it drifts into absurdity, that was pure gold.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe voices are all good I think, especially Yuuko and the professor have a lot of time to shine. The first opening wasn't bad, but the second was amazing. That was one of the most chaotic pieces of music I've heard, which is more than fitting for this partially bizarre anime. The first ending song was nice, but nothing too special, the second ending got multiple different songs accompanying it, which were either hit or miss.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe variety of characters is one of the strenghts of Nichijou, be it the main or side characters. What I thought was a good idea was splitting up the bad characteristics of Azumangas Tomo and divide them between Yuuko and Mai. These two are a lot more likeable than Tomo AND they both get their comeuppances every now and then. Misato is a great tsundere parody, Nano and the professor are just plain cute and funny and all the other characters are just as entertaining (I could keep going for hours).\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis anime was a lot of fun. The 26 episodes passed by in no time. All the characters, all the jokes, the running gags, the good feeling when something actually went right for someone. I can safely say that Nichijou was a great comedy in every aspect. If there is something I could criticize it's that some gags are dragged out quite a bit. Some people don't like that, but I found it to still be within my personal boundaries. If you're looking for a funny timekiller, Nichijou is a good choice.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9.2/10",

            "content": "There are very few ways to describe Nichijou, because as a sketch comedy/slice of life show its very sporadic.  The show is funny, touching, and beautiful.  Its appeal can be divided up into three basic parts.\r\n(1) Humor\r\nThere is never a dull moment.  The show uses hyperbole and over-the-top animation to drive home some jokes, and deadpan dullness for others.  It's extremely experimental and a lot of skits are hit or miss.  But luckily, the show is a collection of skits, and if one of the skits happens to be a miss, you only have to wait 1-6 minutes before theshow moves on to a completely different skit.  It's fast-paced and funny, which is a great combination because the laughs never stop coming.  \\n\\n\r\n(2) Art\\n\\n\r\nThe character design is so simplistic that you wouldn't think that this show would get a great deal of praise for is art.  Yet, every frame is near perfection.  The amount of work that went into the animation of the show is visible in a lot of skits.  It's not often you see animation as good as Nichijou's used in a comedy show, especially so often.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd even though the animation is already top-quality, the backgrounds and still shots are equally amazing.  The art is simply beautiful and transitions are done by beautifully drawn images of some background, like an apartment complex, a field with a lake, or an elevator.  Overall, its some of the most beautiful animation/art I've ever seen in an animated show.  \\n\\n\r\n(3) Characters\\n\\n\r\nThe show is incredibly cute and fun and the characters are unique.  Within the second half of the show, some serious efforts are made to make so semblance of character development, and its actually really touching.  Though the show is primarily a comedy, it is able to touch other emotions as well, and overall is an extremely heartwarming show.  The characters are also extremely cute and fun, making the show just fun to watch overall.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe rewatch value of Nichijou is infinite.  Since the skits have almost no ties between them, they can be watched in any order and still be hilarious, meaning that any episode can be rewatched at any time for some laughs.  \\n\\n\r\nI highly, highly recommend this show.  Normally I feel as though a lot of humor is lost through subtitles because comedic timing is inherently lost, but Nichijou still manages to be downright hilarious.  \\n\\n",

That's it. Nothing more to it, nothing less to it, just 26 episodes about life set as a comedy. What made this enjoyable wasn't the story but the comedy. \r\nIt would be foolish to think of this more than a comedy. I found myself enjoying it less later in the series as it became less randomas it seemed they were trying to wrap things up in a shorter time frame. \\n\r\nThat feeling of being rushed does take away the enjoyment sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nTech \\n\r\nI think my favorite part of the show was the art style. I really liked it, simple but effective. It's not overly impressive compared to other shows, but it really suits the feeling of Nichijou. If the story was more serious I don't think the art style would have paid off. \\n\r\nThe sound quality was good, and the sound effects where fun. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nThe characterization was pretty well thought out in general. There were no useless characters and they all fulfilled their roll in the show, which is to entertain us. The designs fitted the art style and there wasn't a bad design amongst them all. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\r\nAn enjoyable comedy with plenty of gags. I found allot of the screaming gags to be a bit much though and took away from me enjoyment a fair bit. But overall it was fun. I don't think this show would be a big prize winner for anything though.",

On the surface, Nichijou appears to be a Slice of Life anime that thrives on non-sequitur humor, a plotless over-silly ball of beautifully animated fun. However, what it does is show how the victories and obstacles we encounter every day, the pointless coincidences and the little miracles we witness every day of our lives are actually beautiful. I believe the over-dramatic way some of the girls react to minor issues like dropping some food is actuallyhow the problem feels at the time. It takes these occurrences and scales them up to how they feel in our minds. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime also deals with relationships in an awesome way. Without spoiling the series, there are several relationships that develop over the course of the series, and at each turn I found myself celebrating their triumphs and mourning their losses. Keep in mind, actual plot happens maybe once every three or four episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially, the reason I love Nichijou so much is it shows the beauty inherent in our every day lives. It shows us that the ordinary is actually anything but. It helps us see the goodness in life. And that's what good art should do.",

This is a twenty six episode consisting of nothing but chaos and mayhem. \r\nArt: 8\r\nWhile completely skipping story and characters (which are non existent) the art is this show is excellent and it shows how much went into the animation and how well it went with this show.\r\nSound: 8\r\nThe show consists a very remember-able soundtrack, the opening theme for the show is very catchy and fun\r\nEnjoyment: 8 \r\nThis definitely is one of my favorite shows that I can watch over and over andnot get bored of the wacky humor this show implies.",

Nichijou is centered around multiple characters, as it's a 'slice of life' anime there is no real protagonist. That being said just because it's a 'slice of life' doesn't mean you can lay back and watching it without trouble. The main reason is that this anime is contains so much random events shoved in your face that you'll end up give up connecting the dots. \r\nThe style of animation for Nichijou fits great with it's comedy and sudden outbursts. The art ranges from no detailcute to high detail epic. The anime art style closely resembles the manga art style, so at time if feels as if you where watching the manga come to life.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the sudden outburst of randomness i found this enjoyable and served it's purpose of being a comedy. If you like to watch something just for a laugh. i'd recommend this",

The art obviously isn't awesome, but I think it fits very well with the story, since it's simple and enjoyable. All the characters are so funny and likeable! I loved all them :D and I wish I had friends like them haha. I highly recommend this anime you can watch it pretty fast and with yourfriends will be even better.",
