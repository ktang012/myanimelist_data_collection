            "content": "There\u2019s a reasonably well-justified tendency among anime fans to hastily dismiss the potential merit of any permutation of the whole \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d motif that\u2019s so nauseatingly ubiquitous in modern anime. In recent times, we\u2019ve had a spate of these lusterless shows - whether it be \u201ccute girls climbing mountains!\u201d or \u201ccute girls that are actually anthropomorphic guns or something!\u201d - and the results are nigh-invariably uninspired dreck that\u2019s not worthy of anyone\u2019s time. With this in mind, it\u2019s only natural to approach the simple premise of \u201ccute girls driving tanks\u201d with caution. It is against all odds, then, that Girls und Panzermanages to not only be worthwhile, but also one of the most consistently entertaining shows in recent memory.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer\u2019s story is a simple one. Schools from around the world compete in a sport called Sensha-do, or \u201cway of the tank.\u201d In this universe, \"tankery,\" as it is colloquially known, is seen as a dignified martial art that helps girls hone their grace and femininity. Miho Nishizumi, the protagonist of this story, was a very capable captain of Sensha-do in her previous school, but due to a traumatic experience in the semi-finals of the previous Sensha-do tournament, she distanced herself from the sport by transferring to a school that doesn\u2019t participate in the Sensha-do, \u014carai Academy. Unfortunately, her new school takes up Sensha-do soon after her arrival. Even more unfortunate is that the school council is aware of her accomplished past as a commander and coerce Miho into being the captain of this newly established Sensha-do unit. While the sheer implausibility and silliness of this premise can be seen as the show\u2019s greatest detriment, it is simply a plot device necessary to get the girls into some tank battles, which is definitely where this show shines brightest. \\n\\n\r\nThe tank battles, simply put, are amazing. Takaaki Suzuki, the military adviser for Girls und Panzer, shows a great understanding of the ins and outs of tankery. As the rules specify, each tank needs to be of World War 2 vintage or older. These tanks are presented with great accuracy and attention to detail, each one having their strengths and weaknesses based on their real life counterparts. The battles themselves are often loosely based on real historical battles, generally involving \u014carai playing the underdog, and each one taking place at various unique environments. The many distinct and varied locations coupled with the accurate depiction of each tank lends itself well to some genuinely engaging strategies, both from \u014carai and their opponents, and are genuinely exciting to watch. As these battles are loosely based off historic events, many of \u014carai's schemes mirror well-known strategic maneuvers and consequently remain both entertaining and satisfying to witness unfold. \\n\\n\r\nWith that said, this is hardly a serious anime about battling tanks; the excitement incited during these battles is enhanced twofold by how infectiously silly and fun the different girl's personalities are. In stark contrast to their competition, the girls of \u014carai Academy are a convivial bunch. They paint their tanks pink, do an embarrassing dance to improve morale, and cherish friendship over winning the match. Cheesy, right? Well, it is, but the show embraces this cheesiness in a way that makes it feel genuine and endearing. What makes Girls und Panzer\u2019s comedy so special is that it\u2019s never afraid to laugh at itself and how preposterous its premise is. Each tank on \u014carai\u2019s side has a team of operators amusingly framed around their unique clique. For example, one team is composed of gamers who approach Sensha-do in a similar way that one approaches a video game. Another team consists of history buffs who romanticize past historical battles and leaders, attempting to emulate them with their hilariously over-the-top antics. \u014carai\u2019s opponents are similarly depicted as caricatures of their respective nations, such as the British team being refined in composure and perpetually drinking tea during the match, or the cocky American team that stoops to utilizing underhanded tactics. The battles contain a fair share of unorthodox stratagems that contribute to this pervasive sense of fun as well. Even when the girls of \u014carai are up against seemingly insurmountable odds, the show never loses touch of its deft sense of humor.\\n\\n\r\nBut Girls und Panzer isn\u2019t all fun and tankery. During the time spent away from Sensha-do, the show does attempt to have a few more serious plot lines, which generally yields poor results. The show spends an inordinately long time attempting to set up its admittedly silly plot in a comparatively serious way, and falls flat on its face in doing so. Thankfully, this is only an issue for the first episode and a half, as the show picks up steam once it gets to the Sensha-do tournaments and generally takes itself less seriously. Due to the massive size of the cast, minor conflicts are dismissed almost as soon as they\u2019re introduced. For instance, one minor arc involves a character who gave up the family business of arranging flowers to take up Sensha-do. This is met with harsh disapproval from her family, but is soon after entirely dismissed after her parents watch one of her matches. There isn\u2019t any character development as the result of this, and the parent characters are never seen again in any meaningful context. It only serves as a shallow feel-good moment that slows down the momentum of the show. Most characters, while entertaining enough in the context of the group, are relatively two-bit and characterized solely by their unique quirk when looked at on their own merits. Miho is the only character to receive any real development, and even that plays out in a fairly predictable manner. However, these breaks from tankery only compose a very small fraction of the show. Most of Girls und Panzer\u2019s episodes are dedicated to their engaging tank battles and, provided one is enjoying the ride, it becomes possible to overlook their fleeting, minor flaws in storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and soundtrack are generally excellent and complement each other appropriately. The soundtrack marches with militaristic tunes that fit well with the action taking place on screen while the tanks are rendered using very detailed CG that looks great in motion. Unfortunately, some of the CG environments during the battles aren\u2019t as well-realized as the tanks are, often appearing flat with repetitive textures. This is most apparent during the earlier episodes, where it\u2019s clear that the production staff had a limited budget; CG heavy scenes are marred by a poor frame rate and the environments are at their worst. Fortunately, this is remedied as the show goes on and, by its final episodes, the show is an absolute delight to look at. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Girls und Panzer won\u2019t make you re-evaluate the way you view anime or present you with a profound take on life, but what it does do is present a thoroughly entertaining and refreshing variation on the whole \u201ccute girls doing cute things\" theme. Despite its flaws, Girls und Panzer\u2019s infectious silliness and engaging battle scenarios should have any viewer plastered with a permanent grin on their face, screaming \u201cPanzer Vor!\u201d for the duration of any given episode. It\u2019s a simple pleasure, but one well worth the time.",

            "content": "Story 8/10\r\nOther then the whole high school girl club about tanks aspect, the story is not very original, but I never really based the quality of an anime on how original its is, just how well executed it is and the story for Girls und panzer was pretty well executed. There were several conflicts and issues in the story that developed through the anime that were paced well. I found the ending quite satisfying. The scenes are well written and the whole anime had a nice pace that was comfortable, but not too slow either. The dialogue is good, even though both can get reallyreally cheesy at times (good thing I like it when a bit of cheesiness is thrown in). If you're looking for a story that's fun, has lots of action, and about friendship with a little drama thrown in, then this anime might be for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nI really like this art style. It was clean, simple, and smooth while being bright and colorful. It fits the light hearted feel of the anime. The tanks look great, but I not a tank expert so I do not know how accurate the tank designs are. What really impressed me about the art though was the backgrounds. The backgrounds have great detail, look good, and are some of the best I have seen. I hate it when an anime goes cheap on the background, so I'm excite that the Girls und panzer team put in the effort. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10 \\n\r\nThe anime focuses on building good groups and group dynamics. So none of the characters stand well on their own, but a tank in not operated by one person, but by a crew, so its cool that an anime about tanks focusing on the crew's overall personality rather then spending airtime focusing on each character that should be spent focusing on the crew being together. A lot of the characters are simply following their archetypes, so their not very original, but that is okay since they display their archetypes so well and in such a light hearted humorous fashion. I was surprised on how much I cared about the characters from the rival schools, since they didn't have a lot of air time, but they were snuck in here and there which helped with the continuity. So overall I really like the characters in Girls und Panzer, but I could how someone else could justify not really liking them at all.  \\n\\n\r\nMusic 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme are okay, but the background music is one of the anime's strong points. It just fits the anime so well. \\n\\n\r\nAtmosphere 10/10\\n\r\nThe music, the tanks, the tournament, the school clubs, everything in Girls und Panzer makes for a great atmosphere. I fell so alive when the military parade music comes on just at the right time. I don't know very much about tanks so I don't know if the battles are realistic, but I love them. During episode four I was like \u201chow are they going to get out of this\u201d like three times and they kept on surprising me. I was so excited.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer is lacking in a few parts, but I found the anime overall to be quite humors, cool, and sweet.  Girls und Panzer can also be quite funny at times too. If your into tanks, sports animes, high school club animes, cute high school girls, or animes about friendship then you might want to give Girls und Panzer a try.",

            "content": "Senshado. Tankery. The Way of the Tank.\r\n\u201cA strong, but delicate art that aims to make women more polite, graceful, modest, and gallant, both on and off the battlefield. To learn tankery is to armor the heart of a maiden, the soul that embraces and burns with femininity. Intense and strong like a tank's iron. Cute and lively, like the clattering of its track. And finally, passionate and precise, like its main weapon. If you train in tankery, you will become a better wife, a better mother, a better student, and a better worker. You will become healthier, kinder, stronger, and men from all over theworld will fall to your feet-\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWell, if that's not the most hilariously nonchalant, yet enticingly charismatic recruitment narrative I've heard for anything, ever, much less tanks. Sign me up- Wait a minute. I'm a man...\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer was directed by Tsutomu Mizushima and scripted by Reiko Yoshida. Character designs were done by Humikane Shimada. Produced by Actas as this studio's first independent work, we follow the story primarily through the perspective of Miho Nishizumi. Strong-armed by the Student  Council into joining Ooari's revived Tankery elective, Miho Nishizumi finds herself responsible, as the only individual on her team experienced with Armored Fighting Vehicle, or AFV, strategy and tactics, for leading her friends and other saps excited by the prospect of operating tanks, gaining credits, or becoming better women, to victory in the national Senshado tournament. If not, there's always next year, right? Why is Miho so knowledgeable about tank operations to begin with? Speaking of which, why is she, a Nishizumi no less, a familial relation to one of the oldest and most feared Senshado think tanks of Japan, here in Ooarai to begin with?\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to make this point clear: \u201cGirls und Panzer\u201d is not a play on \u201cGirls und Pantsu.\u201d Director Mizushima made in emphatic that he would tolerate no panty shots in his series. In fact, outside a couple of onsen scenes, which, aside for some minor cleavage, are rather tame in any event, there's little to no overtly skeevy fan service in this show at all, however cynically exploitative one may conceive the concept of female adolescents juxtaposed to military hardware. For all intents and purposes, Girls und Panzer is a show about girls and panzers, a show that combines slice of life and tank battles, and you know what? It works.\\n\\n\r\nHow? Because of how seriously and seamlessly the show engages in both premises, provided that people are willing to suspend their disbelief about the absurdity of teenage high school girls driving steel ton AFVs. Particularly pressing is the willingness to tolerate this show's usage of moe. Moe is a far encompassing term, but the majority of the anime community outside Japan's come to associate it with cute and often underage members of the female sex. In this context, moe in shows carries with it a rather negative connotation of shallow, white-knight fetishization when relied upon as the primary draw. To juxtapose full-on moe next to weaponry is another fetish entirely, and I don't fully disagree with that assessment. It certainly has some truthful merit, but it's also lead to an unfortunate overgeneralization that any show that contains cute girls and slice of life is meant to be fap material for pedophilic shut-ins. To characterize that stereotype to Girls und Panzer, I have one thing to that.\\n\\n\r\nNuts.\\n\\n\r\nIn context, this series has shown that it is perfectly mature enough to use both to drive part of its narrative and add depth as well as charm, because at the very most, it is only used as an element, and one that isn't imposing at that. Some of this medium's most universally celebrated shows have incorporated elements that are, without a doubt, superficial, and yet they remain lauded by many, because they were more than just that. Girls und Panzer should be considered no differently.\\n\\n\r\nSlightly less pressing, but still of utmost importance to understand is that, beyond rejecting or even merely tolerating this show's mainly predominantly female and adolescent cast, this fact should be taken with sensible humor. It's a universe where entire cities are straddled on giant aircraft carriers, where Senshado is a martial art, a pastime, and a sport where in-universe precautions are taken to ensure that casualties are rare, where the tank crews are staffed entirely by women because it's considered a womanly pursuit. Instead of scrutinizing on how situating cities on ships are possible, harking on tankery as a sport is stupid because it's dangerous in real life, becoming indignant on how it's making a derogatory statement of propaganda towards men, ask yourself... Does it matter? Is it explained in context? And honestly, do you think the staff, who happen to be filled with male individuals, is going out of their way to say that women are better than men, potentially alienate the very demographic that they know would make up the consumer base for their DVDs and BDs? It's funny, and it's even more so because the cast takes the world they belong to and the sport they participate in seriously, like it's a natural thing because to them, it is. That doesn't preclude taking everything this series has to offer with a grain of salt, only that we manage to see events from their perspective. By extension, it also applies to the other competitor schools, whose tank commanders are defined by nationalistic traits similar to the ones in Hetalia, though with more nuance and less homo, enough to be amusing without immersion-breaking.\\n\\n\r\nAlso an absolute joy, at least for similarly interested minds like mine, are the seamlessly integrated historical references scattered and layered throughout the series. If no one caught on to its invocation earlier on in this review, the original utterance of \u201cNuts\u201d was a famous response uttered by an embattled American general to his German counterpart regarding the latter's demand to have the Allied command stranded at Bastogne surrender during the Battle of the Bulge. Interestingly enough, the show makes that very same reference in Episode 9. If I was a girl in Ooari High School, I'd definitely would have found myself riding along in a StuG III. I'm a history enthusiast and war buff, and to pick out how much effort was spent in integrating these references into the show is outright outstanding. These references transcend not only utilize words; they transcend them. As samples, Episode 5 delves into the effect that intelligence gathering and deception has determining the currents of battle. Episode 6 goes into a totally fitting monologue on the history of the American M4 Sherman tank. Episode 9 demonstrates Soviet T-34 tank strategy in action and highlights the importance of morale during armed engagement, and Episode 11 makes a subtle reference to the Germany's lightning armored mobilization into the heart of France, bypassing the heavily fortified Maginot Line using the thickly wooded Ardennes Forest. Hell, one of the characters is based off Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.\\n\\n\r\nA delight for tank aficionados and a great source of tangential learning from everyone else are the tanks themselves. While originally made for anime goers, overtime, it's gotten attention and praise from many tank fans as well. Going so far as to hiring a military expert to advise its creators during production, this show has taken great pains to make sure each tank looks and runs as authentically as can practically be, from the stops of a Type 89 to the rivets of a Panzer IV. Some liberties no doubt were taken for entertainment value, such as tread speed and pressure fatigue, but, for the most part, it was dead on. The series goes so far as even to even illustrate the drawbacks of individual AFVs, such as the Type 89's pathetic show of firepower against most of its contemporary armor and the Porsche Tiger's awkward tendency towards engine malfunctions.\\n\\n\r\nBut how do these tanks look when animated? Fantastic. CG has always been a tricky technique to incorporate within cell, but here, not only do the tanks look absolutely fluid, rendered in CG, on the move, and scenic, rendered in cell, when they aren't. Not a significant detail is lost during these transitions, all of which to make the show that much more thrilling to the pupils. This isn't even mentioning how amazing the muzzle flashes, dust clouds, smoke screens, and shell bombardments look. In fact, the show's art, from the backdrops and set pieces, to the lighting and shading, are all just sights for sore eyes. And, for what it's worth, I think the character designs aren't half bad either, once you get used to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe tanks might look nice during a fight, but how's the actual fight itself? Rather than simply piling one bigger spectacle after another, the show goes out of its way to use strategy and tactics, the actual strategy and tactics of tank warfare to move the currents of battle from one point to the next. Offense vs defense. Open field vs urban combat. All-out assaults vs hit and run strafes. Team Formations. Rear Guards. Positioning. Scouting. Decoys. Feints. Traps. All of these maneuvers and more are utilized, taking into account mission objectives, area surroundings, general, specific, and overall tank characteristics, the most innovative of them responsible by Ms. Nishizumi and her knack for bold, unorthodox, but nonetheless wildly creative and effective solutions. That doesn't go to show everything she does is brilliant. She, as much as the other tank commanders, have their shares of brilliant moments and demoralizing blunders, but unlike the others, Miho, like all great and potentially great military leaders, is able to adapt to the fickleness of the battlefield and, with a little luck, turn temporary setbacks into permanent victories.\\n\\n\r\nLike candy, constant excitement proves tiring to audiences after a while of non-stop consumption. One answer to this dilemma is greater and greater amounts of spectacle to keep them interested at that same level. It gets to a point though where the previous spectacles become harder and harder to top, to the point that the next attempt might either end up a dud because of desensitization or be so ridiculous that it breaks immersion. Sole dedication to this method is especially troublesome for a series whose spectacle relies on some realism, like Girls und Panzer's tank battles. The other answer then is to generate pacing, to allow the audience to have lulls in their action so that the next action sequence that comes about feels that much sweeter to people. Girls und Panzer is an excellent example of good pacing, and it all stems from its slice of life. The show begins in media res, the hook, where we get a tempting taste of all the tanks rolling along. Then, we start at the top, getting grounded into the characters, the setting, and the situation, building up for another climax all the while. We get a match, then we get a break with the characters. We get another match, fight and flight, then another, rest and digest, one climax after another, until we get the final one and we're blown off our rockers, pumping our fists, gasping for breathe because of what was just witnessed, and it's significant because it's the first time those reactions happened with this much intensity. First times, just by their inherent nature, can be really intense.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters. Being that it is but one cour, the show can't afford to linger on any one person for too long without ruining battle momentum, considering how many of the girls take up the screen. Outside of Miho then, it relies on a principle that shows should be following more in the first place: \u201cShow, don't tell.\u201d Compared to other series, Girls und Panzer has much less verbal hand-holding. Off the field and especially on it, each vignette of these characters doing something carries with them precious statements that speak volumes about them on their own: their personalities, their proficiencies, their interests, their aspirations. Granted, outside of Miho and perhaps her personal tank crew, all four of these aspects are relatively simplified, but, using inference, they are simplicity thoroughly defined, and above all, a unifying message between all of them gets across. The message is especially poignant in Episode 5, where the Student Council shows Miho their memories of Ooari using a photo album. They never explicitly say that they love their school, but that right there is more than enough to convey to the audience, or at least to me, how much it means to them. This method of narrative also extends beyond to the plot, the tactics, and the tanks as well, so that not a single moment is wasted trying to explain something the viewers can contextually figure out on their own. None of it feels contrived, and you know what? I appreciate that the staff assumes us, or at least the majority of us, as intelligent enough to do some mental legwork.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it is, the character depth is fine the way it is, and any further fleshing out is better off relegated to future sequels. That being said, I do have one complaint about the characters in regards to their friendships, particularly the main heroines. It's a criticism that's more valid in the beginning, and it might be just my cynicism or ressentiment talking. They're a bit idealistic. To create such fast and true relationships with people to the point they are willing to give up their preferred elective and stand up against the Student Council with you despite having just recently met... I end up asking myself: Why have I never met friends like that? In addition, some of the character drama could be better executed, like Hana Izuzu's for example, as some of it seems rather sudden, even taking slice of life into account. That being said, both issues are far from enough to be a major detriment. I guess predictability in terms of storytelling and character development also may be a drag for some, but I've always considered the means rather than the ends to be something I take to heart more.\\n\\n\r\nOn the music side of things, I won't deny I'm rather partial to marches. Lighthearted yet prideful, dignified yet stirring, pompous yet boisterous, combined with the fact that they comprise the most memorable portions of the OST, original scores and borrowed ones, British, American, Russian, German, I found myself stomping my feet to them in rhythm fairly often. But more than how I like them on their own, I love how they are used in tandem with the show's visuals. Since there's only so many I can talk about, I'll try to keep examples controllable. My elation was rather high, for instance, when an abridged version of \u201cU.S. Field Artillery March\u201d by John Phillip Sousa was playing alongside a formation of moving Shermans. Then there's a lovely band arrangement and seiyuu vocal chorus of the popular folksong Russian \u201cKatyusha\u201d by Mantei Blanter and Mikhail Isakovsky to a mobile spread of Soviet armor. It's quite likely that some of the pronunciation may have been off, but from what I could tell, they tried rather earnestly to come close, and regardless, the singing's outstanding. Unfortunately, it was cut upon official release to international audiences due to private domain issues. Lest I forget is the anime original \u201cSenshado March: Panzer Vor!\u201d and its melodically constant derivatives by Shiro Hamaguchi. A love letter to of everything great about military marches, the steady cadence of snares and horned bass, the bombasts of cymbals, the blasts of trumpets, the tight, orderly frivolity of the piccolo, it's a wonderful piece that stands on its own to the classics.\\n\\n\r\nI'd be remiss to forget discussing the OP and ED, so, being obviously J-Pop, how do they hold up? For J-Pop, they hold up pretty well. The OP, Choucho's \u201cDreamrider,\u201d incorporates a nice rhythmic riff at the beginning and end reminiscent of march cadences, but it otherwise uses electric guitars, electronic synthetics, and drum sets, and the art and animation, scenic and fluid, outside introducing tank teams, hold no illusions in emphasizing what's given from the title. And yet, through, once again, a great use of pacing both from the great vocals and engaging visuals, everything feels very dynamic, like, suspension of disbelief withstanding, it's going somewhere good. The ED, \u201cEnter Enter MISSION!\u201d by the seiyuu of the main heroines, can't help but be incredibly charming in how competent, enthusiastic, and earnest the singers are, despite the sappy atmosphere. Plus, the visuals consist of chibi versions girls of the various Ooari armor crews riding in super deformed versions of their tanks. You'd have to be a pretty jaded and bitter anime fan not to crack a smile at that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, once one gets used to the aforementioned concerns, Girls und Panzer is a fun show that, while not incredibly \u201cdeep\u201d or complex, should be given credit as much for its technical precision and narrative intuition as well as its terrific music, its played-straight humor, its abundant historical references, its smart, well-paced, and exhilarating tank scraps, and yes, its cute, but never quite fetishized, high school girls.\\n\\n\r\nNow, time for some light historical research.\\n\\n\r\nI give Girls und Panzer an 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "Something that I have discovered whilst watching Girls Und Panzer is that trying to convince people that it is genuinely a fantastic show is nigh on impossible. I don't blame them, if someone had told me before I watched it that I'd be rating it an 8 and calling it a highlight of the year then I would have greeted them with a doubting look, wondering whether they were joking or whether they just had bad taste.\r\nIt's obvious why there's so much doubt, it's the premise. Cute girls driving tanks immediately brings up memories of shows of \"cute girls doing cute things\" or of \"Cutegirls doing [insert unusual activity here]\", both have which rarely produce anything other than mediocrity at best. With this overwhelming abundance of poor shows, the ability to believe that Girls Und Panzer could be anything other is incredibly difficult.\\n\\n\r\nBelieve me though, Girls und Panzer is really the diamond in the rough.\\n\\n\r\nThe natural question here is what sets it apart from the rest? To put it simply, it is its comedy, its earnestness, its action, but above all its execution. \\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer is a show with a ridiculous premise and setting, the show acknowledges this and embraces it to deliver great comedy. No matter how ridiculous the happenings or plot points, like friendly tank battles being held in town centres, or a man thinking it's good luck that a tank crushed his shop, it plays it straight and just lets you enjoy it, without it pointing the joke out to make sure you got it. It mocks clich\u00e9s by putting them into stupid contexts and then blowing them completely out of proportion. There will always be something there to make you laugh, the humour of the show is very consistent, and though it's not the biggest draw of the show, it's what helps to make the show so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are incredibly likable and work perfectly within the context of the show. There are a large number of characters, but every single one, whether it be someone on the Panzer squad or someone on the opposing team, will bring a smile to your face at some point. These aren't deep characters, but they don't need to be, they often have stupid and ridiculous traits, but that's the point, whether it be the girl who also sits on her lieutenants shoulders to put her above everyone because she's got a complex about being childlike, or the vice president who's usually calm and collected who goes crazy when she's battling in the tanks, they bring enjoyment by being so stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThe really surprising aspect about Girls und Panzer is how realistic yet still ridiculous the tank battles are. The people who choreographed the battles obviously knew the tanks involved inside out, providing startlingly realistic battles, all whilst the tanks are running around coloured bright pink or with Edo period flags. The battles are amazing in how much the intelligence of the realism and tactics conflicts with the bizarre and absurd nature of events.  You will be entertained, and there is sometime genuine tension in the battles, especially the later ones. The animation of the battles improves greatly as the series progresses, in earlier episodes the CGI looks awkward, but by the end it's much better and used very well with solid animation, providing fast exciting action. The camera angles are done very well, particularly in the last showdown where I can only say they were perfectly done.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation as a whole started off fairly average, but as the episode count increases it's obvious that the budget increased significantly, by the end the animation was excellent, it's visually appealing and there are no mistakes or off model characters. The soundtrack was strong on the whole, with some great military marches and themes that really added to the scenes and battles. The voice acting was strong, making sure to keep everything straight (and often hilariously over the top) so that the humour was conveyed correctly. The opening \"Dream Riser\" is an uplifting track which suits the series well, and the ending \"ENTER ENTER Mission\" is generic but rather catchy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm not saying that Girls und Panzer is the best show out there, but it executes what it's trying to do flawlessly. The show plays everything so honestly and with such earnest that you cannot be cynical about it, but wish to enjoy the show like it wants you too.  This show is really the height of entertainment, and during the weeks that I watched it, despite myself I grew to love the show more and more.\\n\\n\r\nYou may still be doubtful that Girls und Panzer is the brilliant show I'm painting it to be, but I whole heartedly recommend you go and give it a try, as it really is pure and enjoyable entertainment at its best.",

            "content": "This was better than I expected. The premise on this series is battles between groups of tanks as an after school club. In this crazy world, this is treated just as another sport which contributes somewhat to feminity. (I wonder what the hell would boys do, given the proper atention by the series: \u00bfkill each other?, \u00bflearn to cook?).\r\nArt gets pretty interesting when tanks are battling.\r\nAll related to tanks is ok and even seems well documented, but the slice of life with stribes on the girls seems to pale a bit in comparison. Take for instance a moment at episode two or three when thegirls hang out together: one girls wears contact lens, another has some utillage in her backpack, and when you think a dialogue will burst out... the scene ends. At least there's almost no slice of life, as this is mostly about battles.\\n\\n\r\nIt is obviously impossible to show a development for three to five girls in each of the five tanks (twenty people, if I recall). There are brief stories for three of the main girls. The story involves mostly a world competition.\\n\\n\r\nMusic could have been way more epic. Cute versions of belic themes are ok but not awesome. Check, for instance, Strike Witches OST. I would remark: the anglerfish dance and the russian song.\\n\\n\r\nGood:\\n\r\nThe tank action.\\n\r\nThey take this crazy world so seriously that it seems plausible.\\n\\n\r\nBad:\\n\r\nThe twelve episodes seem to be not enough: the show even skips one of the matches, just showing the resolution (seems it was later made into an OVA).\\n\r\nToo much miraculous shot evading gets notorious. Play a game of tanks and do as they do: you will get blown in three seconds.\\n",

            "content": "~Multilingual review, English & Espa\u00f1ol: Girls und Panzer~\r\nNowadays \"Cute girls doing cute things\" have become an unwritten genre, or better, a keyword that open a window through which we can imagine completely how it's going to be an anime, even if our knowledge about it are pair to zero, we could almost go far and state a \"first impression\" derived only by hearing those words. We tend to imagine a group of cute girls doing absolutely nothing, actually only cute things, or engaged in some particular activity, sometimes that unusual that we could consider them totally out of ordinary or from what we could call\"acceptable\".\\n\\n\r\nUsually \"cute girls doing cute things\" type of anime aren't serious ones, mostly comedy or Slice of Life, but there are sometimes that some of them breaks this, almost, rule. The good thing about them is that you could enjoy watching an unusual activity being done by a group of cute girls, and this time I came across something really particular... girls and tanks!, and believe or not, this was quite different from the ones I've watched before, this anime shown a great quality, unexpected differently from a \"cute girl doing cute things\". You won't find only cute girls driving tanks, in this show there's actually a deep and accurate understanding about tanks, actually this feels that different that there're hardly scenes portraying the typical cliche scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nFanservice is absent, there are no beach episodes, no thermal waters episode, no Cultural/Sport Festival, no pool episode, any kind of cliche scenario or situation that could expose the girls sex appeal are absent. There aren't fanservice yuri undertones and the girls never groped each other... I was quite surprised, as well as glad, and then again, quality was shown, this anime totally focused on what we came for: awesome battle with tanks.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around \"Sensha-d\u014d\", literally translated as \"the way of the tank\", and the girls who practices it. What would be that?, -Sensha-d\u014d is the martial art that strives to nurture polite, graceful, humble and brave maidens-, or in other words: Tank warfare with girls!. With that said, the story begins with the new Oarai High School transfer student, Nichizumi Miho, our protagonist, a Sensha-d\u014d veteran by then retired from the battlefields due to a traumatic experience in a competition. Oarai High School distinguish itself from not having Sensha-d\u014d classes.. or so Miho thought, but as soon as she arrives the student council decides to take it up and participate in the National Sensha-d\u014d Tournement. After the initial dubious state, Miho decides to give another chance to Sensha-d\u014d, and along her new inexperienced teammates, the National Tournament awaits, meanwhile unknown for our protagonists but no for us, the viewers, their School is about close if they don't win.\\n\\n\r\nAs you've probably realized, the story is quite simple and originality isn't by their side neither, there's practically none character development. If you ask me why such a high score for this anime, I would reply you with three strong points about it:\\n\\n\r\n1- Sensha-d\u014d\\n\r\n2- Really likeable group of characters\\n\r\n3- Focus on important things, leaving clich\u00e9 and fanservice totally outcast\\n\\n\r\nEven if I tend to like anime with more complicated plots, twists, ect, I need to say that Girls und Panzer \"plot development\" was carried in a wonderful manner, each episode was focused on the girls training, the realization of plans and strategies for the next battles, bonding, a quick but well done focus on the principal characters, and finally, great tanks battles filled with real accurate \"tankery\" and details, that's why I listed between the strong points Sensha-d\u014d, which doesn't refer only to the presence of tanks in the anime, it represents the quality of the show itself.\\n\\n\r\n\"Sensha-d\u014d isn't War!\"\\n\\n\r\nIt's a sport, and like every sport, there are rules to follow. I'll now explain briefly in what consist this sport and it's basic rules, just in case you were wondering how and why girls practice such dangerous activity, rest assured, this is actually a well planned sport, in correspondence to the quality level of this show, quite high:\\n\\n\r\n- Tanks admitted in battle are need to be prior Second World War.\\n\r\n- Shells are designed so that they can't penetrate the tanks's armor.\\n\r\n- Black boxes are equipped in order to declare the tank out of game wherever it's damaged by the counterpart.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two kinds of Sensha-d\u014d matches, \"Annihilation\" and \"Flag\". Just like it's name suggest, the first one consist in immobilize all enemy tanks by first, and the second one, Flag, consist in immobilize the enemy's Flagtank by first. Finally there's a restriction rule for the amount of tanks allowed in the National Tournement by each team, First round up to 10 tanks, Semifinals up to 15 tanks and Final up to 20 tanks. The matches are always 1 Team VS 1 Team.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonists teams, the Oarai High School team, consists of 5 tanks, later upgraded to 8. The characters operating them have their very own charming and characteristic, quite difficult to mistook one team for another. We've the protagonist's team operated by Nishizumi Miho, who acts as the Commander, like previously said, she's the only experienced one, the Loader, Akiyama Yukari, a tank otaku girl and the most charismatic character in the show, the Gunner, Isuzu Hana, a quite composed and high leveled head girl, the Driver, Mako Reizei, a quiet and gloomy girl but with a kind heart, and finally the Radio Operator, Saori Takebe, a girl who aims to be popular by any means. The other teams are operated by: the Student Council, since taking up Sensha-d\u014d again was their idea, another group consists of History fanatics, each one personalizing a famous past leader, another one consists of Tank Warfare Online gamers, and going on, the variety is assured. I won't write about all of them since the risk of this review becoming really large is quite high, but they are sure a bunch of mixed personalities.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to Animation and Sound this show couldn't offer for better, battle scenes are done excellent, even the CGI scenes were awesome and flowing, the designs were highly detailed and pleasant for the eyes, and I'm not talking only about the tanks design, also the environment and the battlefield were realized quite well. The Sound was something great, the OriginalSound Track was composed mainly by militaristic tunes quite adapted to harmonize the events in the show, and yet they had an unique but cute charming tune in them which totally fitted also the most passive scenes. They ranged from typical American military tunes to Russian ones, there were also Italians ones!. There was also a very nice musical arrangement of the popular Russian song \"Katyusha\", fitting the parade of the Soviet Team.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer is totally not your typical \"cute girls doing cute things\", it's technical and accurate understanding about tanks make this anime quite enjoyable, and surely, over the top compared to other anime with similar themes. Brilliant execution and development of Battles, along with a fantastic OST, great Animation and whiteout forgetting, a nice crew of High School girls, this anime surely deserve such a high score in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n[Espa\u00f1ol]\\n\\n\r\nHoy en d\u00eda \"cute girls doing cute things\" se convirti\u00f3 en un g\u00e9nero de por s\u00ed, o mejor dicho, una palabra clave que abre una ventana a trav\u00e9s de la cual nos permite, completamente, imaginar como ser\u00eda un anime a\u00fan si no tenemos conocimiento alguno sobre ellos, podr\u00edamos ir lejos y decir \"una primera impresi\u00f3n\" derivada s\u00f3lo al escuchar esas palabras. Tendemos a imaginar un grupo de chicas empe\u00f1adas haciendo absolutamente nada, de hecho s\u00f3lo cosas lindas, o en otras ocasiones empe\u00f1adas en actividades as\u00ed de particulares que las podr\u00edamos considerar fuera del ordinario, o de lo que podr\u00edamos llamar \"aceptable\".\\n\\n\r\nPor lo general \"cute girls doing cute things\" tipo no son serios, principalmente tratan comedia o Slice of Life, pero hay ocasiones en las cuales esta, casi, regla viene infringida. Lo bueno de este tipo de series es que puedes llegar a disfrutar viendo actividades muy inusuales hechas por grupos de chicas, y esta vez me tope con algo bastante particular.. chicas y tanques!, y cr\u00e9anme o no, esto estuvo bastante diferente comparado con las series que he visto antes, este anime demuestra una tremenda calidad, inesperadamente diferente de lo que se espera de un \"cute girls doing cute things\". Aqu\u00ed no encontrar\u00e1s s\u00f3lo chicas conduciendo tanques, en este anime hay de verdad un conocimiento profundo y meticuloso sobre tanques, de hecho esta serie es tan diferente a lo normal que no hay casi escenas mostrando el t\u00edpico clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nEl fanservice queda excluido, no hay episodios de playa, no hay episodios de aguas termales, no est\u00e1 el t\u00edpico Festival Cultural/Deportivo, no hay episodio de piscina, todo tipo de escenario clich\u00e9 o situaciones que expongan el sex appeal de las chicas fueron excluidas. No hubo yuri-fanservice y las chicas nunca se tocaron las unas a las otras... Quede sorprendido, al igual que agradecido, y repito, la calidad se hizo notar, este anime se dedic\u00f3 completamente a lo que hab\u00edamos venido a buscar: buenas peleas de tanques.\\n\\n\r\nLa historia gira entorno al \"Sensha-d\u014d\", traducido literalmente como \"la v\u00eda del tanque\", y las chicas que lo ponen en pr\u00e1ctica. De qu\u00e9 se trata?, -el Sensha-d\u014d es la arte marcial que se empe\u00f1a a cultivar educadas, graciosas, humildes y valerosas doncellas- o en otras palabras: Guerra de tanques entre chicas!. Dicho esto, la historia inicia con la nueva estudiante transferida de Oarai High School, Nichizumi Miho, nuestra protagonista, una veterana del Sensha-d\u014d, ya retirada del campo de batalla debido a una experiencia traum\u00e1tica en una competici\u00f3n. Oarai High School se distingue por no tener un curso de Sensha-d\u014d.. o eso Miho pensaba, no pas\u00f3 mucho antes de su llegada que el consejo estudiantil decide iniciar un nuevo curso e inscribirse en el torneo nacional de Sensha-d\u014d. Despu\u00e9s del inicial rechazo, Miho decide darle otra oportunidad, y junt\u00f3 con sus nuevas compa\u00f1eras, del todo novatas, el torneo nacional les espera, mientras que desconocido para las protagonistas pero no para nosotros espectadores, su escuela ir\u00e1 en la ruina si no consiguen ganar.\\n\\n\r\nComo probablemente habr\u00e1n deducido, la historia es bastante simple, y la originalidad no est\u00e1 siquiera de su parte, tampoco hay desarrollo de personajes. Si me preguntan porque una nota tan alta para este anime, te responder\u00eda con sus tres puntos fuertes:\\n\\n\r\n1- Sensha-d\u014d\\n\r\n2- Un grupo realmente agradable de personajes\\n\r\n3- Enfoque total en las cosas importantes, dejando clich\u00e9 y fanservice completamente fuera\\n\\n\r\nAunque s\u00ed tienden a gustarme anime con una historia m\u00e1s complicada, llena de twists, ect, necesito decir que el desarrollo de la trama de Girls und Panzer fue llevada a cabo de una manera excelente, cada episodio estuvo enfocado en el entrenamiento de las chicas, la realizaci\u00f3n de planes y estrategias para las pr\u00f3ximas batallas, al desarrollo de grupo, a un r\u00e1pido pero eficaz acercamiento a la vida de las chicas, y finalmente, geniales batallas de tanques, llenas de detalles realmente precisos, fue por eso que la agregue el Sensha-d\u014d entre los puntos fuertes, el cual no se refiere solamente a la presencia de tanques dentro del anime, m\u00e1s bien representa la calidad del mismo.\\n\\n\r\n\"Sensha-d\u014d no es la Guerra!\"\\n\\n\r\nEs un deporte, y como todos los dem\u00e1s, hay reglas que seguir. Ahora explicare brevemente en que cosa consiste este deporte y sus reglas b\u00e1sicas, s\u00f3lo por s\u00ed estas curioso como y porque estas chicas hacen una actividad as\u00ed de peligrosa, pero sin preocupaci\u00f3n, este es un deporte planeado en el m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo detalle, el cual corresponde al nivel de este show, bastante alto:\\n\\n\r\n- Est\u00e1n admitidos s\u00f3lo tanques precedentes a la Segunda Guerra Mundial.\\n\r\n- El proyectil est\u00e1 dise\u00f1ado en modo tal que no penetre la armadura del tanque.\\n\r\n- Cajas negras son instaladas con el fin de poner fuera de juego un tanque que ha recibido da\u00f1o por el enemigo.\\n\\n\r\nHay dos tipos de encuentros en el Sensha-d\u014d, \"Aniquilaci\u00f3n\" y \"Bandera\". Justo como de puede deducir de los nombres, el primero consiste en inmovilizar todos los tanques enemigos por primero, y Bandera consiste en inmovilizar el tanque-bandera por primero. Por ultimo hay una regla que pone un techo al n\u00famero de tanques que se pueden usar en el Torneo Nacional por cada equipo, el Primer Round permite hasta 10 tanques, la Semifinal permite hasta 15 tanques y la Final hasta un m\u00e1ximo de 20. Las batallas son siempre 1 Equipo VS 1 Equipo.\\n\\n\r\nNuestros equipos protagonistas, el equipo de Oarai High School, consiste de 5 tanques, despu\u00e9s agrandado a 8. Los personajes que los operan tienen su propio \u00fanico carisma y caracter\u00edsticas, imposible confundir un equipo con otro. Tenemos al equipo protagonista, operado por Nichizumi Miho, como dicho anteriormente, es la \u00fanica veterana del grupo, ella hace de Comandante, despu\u00e9s tenemos al Cargador, Akiyama Yukari, una chica Otaku de tanques y la m\u00e1s carism\u00e1tica del todo el show, el Artillero, Isuzu Hana, una chica bastante madura y compuesta, el Conductor, Mako Reizei, una chica callada y algo sombr\u00eda pero de coraz\u00f3n amable, y por \u00faltimo el Operador Radio, Saori Takebe, una chica que busca ser popular a cualquier costo. Los otros equipos son operados por: el Consejo Estudiantil, dado que fue de ellas la idea de iniciar con el Sensha-d\u014d en su escuela, otro grupo consiste en fan\u00e1ticos de Historia, cada una de ellas esta metida en un comandante famoso del pasado, otro grupo estaba formado por gamers de juegos sobre tanques Online, y v\u00eda diciendo, la variedad est\u00e1 asegurada. No escribir\u00e9 sobre cada uno de ellos pues el riesgo que esta rese\u00f1a se convierta en algo bastante largo no es poco, pero les aseguro que se trata de un grupo compuesto por una complicada variedad de personalidades.\\n\\n\r\nSi venimos a la Animaci\u00f3n y al Sonido, en este show no pudieron haber de mejor, las escenas de combatimiento fueron hechas excelentes, al igual modo tambi\u00e9n las de CGI, que fueron de verdad geniales y fluidas, el dise\u00f1o fue altamente detallado y agradable a la vista, y no estoy hablando s\u00f3lo de los tanques, tambi\u00e9n el ambiente y los campos de batalla fueron realizados bastante bien. El Sonido fue algo especial, las Original SoundTrack fueron principalmente de tono militar, adaptas completamente a armonizar con los eventos que suced\u00edan en el anime, y a\u00fan as\u00ed llegaron a tener ese tono \"lindo\" que acompa\u00f1aba las escenas m\u00e1s pasivas. Abarc\u00f3 desde tonos militares t\u00edpicos Americanos a tonos t\u00edpicamente Rusos, hubieron tambi\u00e9n algunos Italianos!. Estuvo presente tambi\u00e9n una muy buena adaptaci\u00f3n de la famosa canci\u00f3n rusa \"Katyusha\", la cual acompa\u00f1o la avanzada del equipo Sovi\u00e9tico.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer no es m\u00ednimamente el t\u00edpico \"cute girls doing things\", su tecnicismo y precisi\u00f3n en materia de tanques y combatimiento lo hicieron demasiado entretenido, y seguramente, lo colocaron en un podio m\u00e1s alto comparado con otros anime de similar contenido y temas. Brillante ejecuci\u00f3n y desarrollo de batallas, seguido delicadamente por una fant\u00e1stica OST, Animaci\u00f3n genial y sin olvidar un muy agradable grupo de chicas, en mi opini\u00f3n, este anime de verdad merece esta nota alta.",

            "content": "A particular scene in Girls und Panzer always struck me as the most beautiful thing animated. Reizei Mako is a loli with black hair; she wears a white headband and goes to school. The problem is she\u2019s often sleepy and is always late for school. The other members of the cast are worried because they need a teammate for their panzer team (more on that later). Mako is perfect for the role of the driver. But once again, on the day when she is needed, she is still sleeping in her comfy bed. Nishizumi Miho, the protagonist, with her brownish-orange hair decides to wake herup osananamiji-style. In the early morning, cuckoos and alarm clocks cry out to wake Mako up. Yet, she is still asleep. Miho drives a panzer and shoots a bullet into the sky, waking Mako up from her dreams.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the ingenuity of Girls und Panzer. It is the ultimate form of cute girls doing cute things; it\u2019s self-aware of its silliness and plays on it.\\n\\n\r\nIn the setting of Girls und Panzer, Sensha-do or Panzerfahren is considered a ladylike sport. Flower arrangement is one thing, but driving panzers is something else. It apparently makes you a strong, independent female. A competition of the best schools with panzers is held. It is where Girls und Panzer takes its ride to us.\\n\\n\r\nFusing the sports and cute-girls-doing-cute-things genre, this show takes its absurdity to the max. It is comparable to a flat-chested-lesbians-playing-mahjong anime titled Saki and a certain scientific work. You know they\u2019re slice-of-life. However, these shows don\u2019t pretend they\u2019re intelligent. In Garupan\u2019s case, it has girls driving panzers. It\u2019s silly plus intense.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it knows how to make the work intense.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the tournament starts, you are immediately diving into a battlefield of panzers shooting left and right. One of the greatest things in Garupan is its sound design. Its quirky anthem-like soundtrack coupled with the noisy sounds of bullets shooting and tracks rolling create this jarring (and hilarious) sensation that war can be amusing. Think back to your war movies. While there are films like Full Metal Jacket that are funny, they haven\u2019t played on the fact the act of war itself is funny. Few works have done that and this silly anime is one of them. And to do it mostly by sound is a giant accomplishment. Try turning off your video feed: you would still feel the greatness of Garupan. The sound design adds to the epic scale of these battles and it\u2019s something worth commending for.\\n\\n\r\nDuring these battles, Miho stands out as an incredible protagonist. In sports works, we always get the hot-blooded shounen (who\u2019s probably a bishie). Sometimes, we get the overpowered character who can summon the winning hand with 1MP. Not Miho. She\u2019s just smart and can adapt to anything. Her tactics, just like the show, are ingenious. Who would have thought of tank drifting? Miho, of course.\\n\\n\r\nBut inside these panzers are girls and girls like cute things. Director Mizushima Tsutomu (Joshiraku, Another) likes cute girls who like cute things. He knows that this show needs some breather episodes. They\u2019re not actually fanservice, but they are showing us the world-building in Garupan. Yukari, a giant panzer geek, brings the cast to a shop dealing in panzerfahren items. We get the cute-girls-doing-cute-things antics here. Instead of getting turned off, people will find it too surreal (and therefore, enjoyable) seeing these girls get excited about panzers.\\n\\n\r\nThis makes me wish more people should pick up this masterpiece. It reminds us entertainment is just as artistic and creative as artsy animes. A giant world waits for us despite being inferred in a mere twelve episodes. It\u2019s a refreshing look on how the cute-girls-doing-cute-things genre can change. So grab the Commie subs, some popcorn, and cry out these two words: \u201cPanzer vor!\u201d",

            "content": "\u201cGirls und Panzer\u201d, Girls and Tanks (Panzer - taken from the German language), can be considered as one of the few anime which truly sticks to the title. At first glance, it can be said that this show is all about \u2018cute girls competing each other with tanks\u2019. To some it may sound amusing, while for others it might seem as another tedious work. \r\nThe anime is set in the future (some few decades from now) where tanks are obsolete and are at girls\u2019 disposal for honing their skills in Sensha-do (Way of the Tank). We have our protagonist Miho Nishizumi, driven from her pasttraumatic incident, transferring to Oarai High School. Coming from a family renowned for its Sensha-do, Miho is immediately beguiled by the student council into joining Sensha-do. With an example of Bushido (Way of the Samurai) Sensha-do is introduced here, which is depicted by this show quite fairly.\\n\\n\r\nComing back to the story, Miho who has joined Sensha-do is teamed up with the four deuteragonists. With the forming of rest of the teams the student council aims for the championship title, which will be held pretty soon. Oarai High School or moreover the student council has taken the initiative of starting Sensha-do again after a 20 year gap due to certain circumstances. From here on the story continues on showing the hardships met by these girls and how they make their way through each victory.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story is concerned, Girls und Panzer is as passable as any other mediocre anime. Now that being said, there is a ludicrous element in the anime which needs to be brought into light. To my knowledge, one needs to invest an ample amount of time in honing his/her skills to operate a tank, which is attained here by the girls quite effortlessly. Yeah, practice sessions are held here from dawn to dusk. Nonetheless, this is no feat one can achieve by practicing a month or two. Another surreal situation I came across whilst watching the show \u2013 they were allowed to continue their fights in a residential area and the girls were left unscarred even after getting a direct hit. I was completely dumbstruck after watching this and I don\u2019t think there is a need for an argument here.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as \u2018Girls und Panzer\u2019 lacks in the story, it offers a pretty commendable work in the art section. The animation is the most appealing aspect of this anime. Bright and colorful surroundings along with well sorted out landscapes adds up in making it livelier. There might be some dubious stunts performed, however that will be overlooked by intense and fluid action sequels. Praiseworthy here is the detailed and intricate design given to each tank. You will be able to easily distinguish each tank from a far distance. One might even say that maximum amount of time was invested on tanks, as they are one few things this anime has to offer. Character designs are well done. Each character is clearly defined with a different hairstyle and color helping us in easily identifying them.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are the only ones you can look forward to. Each of them is given a background, but not to the mark of your satisfaction. The problem of having so many main characters is that they need to have a story to fill in their past. Then again providing a story would mean extra episodes, which is not an option here. All the side characters are present just to fulfill their purpose in the story. However there is a certain degree of calmness or you can call it \u201cmoe-ness\u201d that will make you feel relaxed. The amalgamation of cute characters and good VA make them adorable to look at.\\n\\n\r\nIt takes a lot of effort in making the sound quality as good as the animation. Many anime fail to deliver that satisfactory mark and this one partly does the job. Each shot from a tank is clearly audible and the engine sound of each tank is distinct enough to be told apart. A good sound in coherence with interesting action scenes makes it a deserving watch. \\n\r\nThe seiyuu did a pretty good job, albeit having very little to adapt from their roles. The OP and the ending themes are good as well, and do contribute to the ambiance of the anime. \\n\\n\r\n\u2018Girls und Panzer\u2019 is an anime you should consider as a light watch. Expectations from the story will leave you disappointed and when you, on the other hand, have nothing to expect from it, you will be astonished by its detailed art and good action scenes. If you are willing to cast aside your affection for a good story, then you might end up having a fun time. \\n\\n\r\nHope you liked the review. Please don\u2019t refrain from pointing out any mistakes (either grammar or argument).\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nStory:               5/10\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 7.5/10\\n\r\nCharacter:       5.5/10\\n\r\nSound:              7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:      6.5/10\\n\r\nOverall:           6.5/10",

            "content": "One of my older reviews that got removed. Back for your amusement.\r\nOverview:\r\nToday we look at one of the silliest anime to come out in recent years! Girls und Panzer ist ein anime about frauen zat drive panzers! Each Panzerbesatzung (tank crew) consists of little moe girls that make otaku go \"awwww\". There is also lots of ww2 tank porn that appeals to armchair army geeks that have played WAY too much World of Tanks and now consider themselves military experts. \r\nPlot: 5/10\r\nThe plot is that tank combat between teams is now a sport, and girls rather than guys are the primary participants of this activity.This plot will no doubt remind older anime fans of \"fighting robot sports\" anime like Zoids Zero and G Gundam. The problem with this besides the obvious safety issues, is that WW2 tanks were extremely different in quality and purpose. If one team is using tanks so shitty that they can't possibly win, than it defeats the purpose of a sport. A team using Japanese model type 95s wouldn't be able to put a dent in a team using Panthers, and their armor would be shredded like wet tissue paper. It would be exactly like Jesse Owens racing against President Roosevelt. Tank warfare in WW2 actually boiled down to boring logistics and things like manufacturing cost, fuel efficiency, ease of use and requisite training hours. That is why tanks like the M4 Sherman and especially the T-34 were considered the best of the war. They could be made at a 5:1 ratio against the massive German tanks like the Tiger, but still had decent quality, were easy to use (especially the T-34), and didn't drain fuel as badly. None of this is adequately captured in G&amp;P, where each team uses roughly equal numbers and has the same amount of fuel and training hours. With these conditions the team using logistically terrible but awesome 1 on 1 tanks like the King Tiger would just win virtually 100% of the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are largely uninteresting moe jailbait. The show should have educated viewers by having all the girls named and modeled after famous WW2 tank commanders. I would love to see a \"3 Stooges\" dynamic between Patton, Zhukov, and Walter Model. That would have been hilarious! Guderian should be the main character, who is totally brilliant, but a vain asshole completely indifferent to any suffering around her. Think Dennis from Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Guderian is on a team with the morally dubious Von Mannstein, the flat out evil Model (whom something bad happens to in every episode), and Rommel (who is the only likeable girl on the team along with being the comedy \"straight man\". Rommel is always trying to apply for a transfer. Our team is up against the American team led by the foul mouthed Patton, who is a few cards short of a full deck, as well as the amiable and frustrated Eisenhower, who is forced to deal with Patton's bullshit every episode. The Soviet team is led by Zhukov, who is a brilliant general, but her school's principal Mrs. Stalin is always giving her idiotic orders. Most of her crew are poorly trained to utterly incompetant, so she resorts to drinking...a lot!\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack largely consists of ear grating, high pitched, school girl renditions of WW2 songs like Katyusha and Panzerlied. Thank fucking GOD we didn't have to hear a school girl rendition of Horst Wessel Lied. That song makes my blood boil when it isn't being sung by obnoxious little girls!\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime had an interesting idea and could have appealed to history fanatics MUCH better than it did. Unfortunately, I don't think it was well executed and ended up being forgettable and mediocre rather than brilliant insanity like it clearly wanted. If the studio ever wants to make a reboot, I would be more than happy to helm the project. As long as I can get WW2 historian David Glantz to be the series narrator.",

            "content": "First of all, I know the series isn't fully out, but this is what I've gathered from what I've watched.\r\nI'm impressed with the way the Panzer IV Ausf. D and the StuG III looked. Was also great see the M3 Grant (going off of the Lee having 7 crew members and the Grant having 6, but that could be developer oversight or crew shortage) and Panzer 38(t) getting some love. The sounds are also decent, not quite there, but that'd ruin the atmosphere of the show.\r\nCharacter design and story are lacking, but its your typical moe blob, so thats that. But as the later episodescome out, the story may or may not improve. Hoping they'll explain how they stay safe inside the tanks while they are shooting AP and worse case APCR rounds at each other. And non-penetrating rounds could still cause spalling, and that's almost worse than getting penetrated.\\n\\n\r\nAlso since they've show M4 Shermans and the Panzer VI Tiger, I wonder how long they're going to have the 75mm/L24 (Since it wasn't designed for tank killing), and upgrade to the 75mm/L43 or L48.\\n\\n\r\nBut only time can tell how the rest of the show is going to pan out, and I'm eagerly awaiting the next episodes. I'll probably do another review at the eighth and twelfth episode marks. Till then~",

            "content": "Girls und Panzer is a running joke that never delivers its punch line, and that is why the show is a masterpiece. One its surface, Girls und Panzer appears to be another \u2018cute girls doing cute things\u2019 anime with the cute thing this time being riding and fighting tanks. That\u2019s the joke. The underlying premise is so ridiculous and absurd that you can\u2019t not find it funny. However, this anime will play it straight faced for all 12 episodes, but it\u2019s still a joke. This anime enrapture you with breathtaking tank battles, clever comedy and surprising drama, but it\u2019s still a joke. The fact thatGirls und Panzer transcends the joke that is at the core the anime into an amazing show makes this a must watch for those who love anime and especially those who love good storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer\u2019s biggest strength is its tank battles. The battles themselves have good pacing that allows for the creation suspense that feels appropriate and adds to the entertainment value. Because tankery is a high school club in Girls und Panzer, it comes with rules in its conduct and victory criteria. These rules are simple to understand, internally consistent and clearly allow for upsets to occur. These rules allow the viewer to understand what the girls are trying to achieve in their battle plans and make the upsets that do occur completely believable. The tanks themselves are historically accurate. Tanks with heavy armor will have tank rounds bounce off, but they will also be slow because of that armor. Many of the WW2 era tanks are showcased at some point in the show and tank buffs will enjoy looking for their favorite tanks.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are solid, though they do not stand out compared to other anime. But with Girls und Panzer\u2019s focus being the tank battles, the main characters are developed well for the time they have and do add to the show. The side characters are ridiculous, but the show is inherently ridiculous so it doesn\u2019t feel odd. They do add a spice to the show that is enjoyable to watch, especially in the first few episodes. The other teams represent various countries in both the tanks they use and the stereotypes of the people on it. Those characters are always fun to watch in the brief appearances they make.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer also resonates with me for personal reasons. My job is to command tanks in combat. This anime is able to capture the trill of firing the main gun of a tank and how awesome it is to maneuver tanks against an enemy force. Fighting in tanks is fun (at least in war games), and this anime shows that. It even shows how much it sucks to fix a tank when breaks down in the field.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I understand that not everyone will love this anime as much as I do, I\u2019m sure that most people will enjoy watching Girls und Panzer and have no regrets doing so.\\n",

            "content": "Guter Tag allen von Ihnen, sorry about that I still have that German thingy after watching the last 2 overdue episode of this 12 episode anime, and btw I hate the way studio Actas have to delay it for 2 months. Ok so now this anime has come to an end, how do I rate this anime?\r\nHere's how:\r\nStory: Sch\u00f6n 6.\r\nThe story plot was very simple yet entertaining, there isn't any profanity nor does it have any violence, the whole plot revolves around the girls of  \u014carai Girls Academy who are member of the newly revived sport called \"Sensha-d\u014d, \" as well as the lifeof one particular group of friends who was headed by  Miho Nishizumi as they go through a lot of struggles in winning the Sensha do national tournament. Yet, the story is also about some trivia about the tanks that were involved in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Ein 3.\\n\\n\r\nI have no qualms about the tanks illustrations, in fact the way the tanks were drawn are with in the realistic concepts of what they look like during World War 2. So the rating was for this anime's design of the character's which the heads are way too big for the body.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sch\u00f6n 6.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say that I like the opening and closing themes, but I do have concerns about Hana Isuzu's seiyu, Mami Ozaki, Yukari Akiyama's seiyu, Ikumi Nakagami, and Kay's seiyu, Kawazumi Ayako, the said character's seiyu just don't have that youthful tone in fact they sounded like Milfs than teenagers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, enjoyment and overall: Gut 7.\\n\\n\r\nI guess you might say that the character's though awkward by design do have their cutsy side especially when it involves them supporting each other, though there was that moment that I would have wish for Miho to reprimand Anzu for keeping a secret at first. The enjoyment part was the tank battle where nobody dies, since it was suppose to be a wholesome thing, so overall this anime was wholesome enough to be watch by anybody who doesn't mind an oxymoron combination of something sweet with controlled violence,   thought a PG rating should be in place for kids who are 11 and below.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTank trivia:\\n\\n\r\nThe MAUS or \"Panzerkampfwagen VIII\" never entered combat service, after the war the only 2 prototype were captured by the allies. The tank itself was a technical failure from the beginning since no there are engine available to power it.  \\n\\n\r\nLegendary tank general Heinz Wilhelm Guderian once oppose the construction of new heavy tanks like the Tiger I and II  due to it's cost and impracticality and instead favors the construction of massive numbers Panzer IV tanks.\\n\\n\r\nBoth Tiger I and II have proven to be prone to certain types of track failures and immobilization, and limited in range by its huge fuel consumption.\\n\\n\r\nGerman tank crews would sometime mount tank tacks on the sides of their turrets as added protection against anti tank guns.\\n\\n\r\nSoviets would  hurl molotov cock-tale behind tank's turret as a way of immobilizing a German tanks, since it  is often where the engine exhaust and ventilation systems are located.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Soviet T-5455 was the most produced tank during the cold war.\\n\\n\r\nThe used of smoke to confuse German Armor was employed by American tank divisions.\\n\\n\r\nThe Flak 88 was initially designed to be uses against aircraft, eventually it was Field Marshall Erwin Rommel who thought of using it against allied tanks during his North African campaign , which later on, led tank designers to mount it in a Tiger as its primary armament.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Girls und Panzer. I never thought I would be attracted to an anime where there's no boy, I mean an anime that seems to be for girls. After watching some minutes, I saw that it has a male demographic in mind.\r\n Honestly, i firstly watched this for the beautiful artwork, and thinking there will be some fanservice, and now i'm following this for other reasons. Believe me, this is REALLY addictive.\r\nStory - 7 (x1.5) : Girls fighting with tanks, what an original and strange idea right? What miss in it, is the development. Let me explain : in any sport anime you'll see that: a meeting of several people who, by building strong relationship, decide to participate in a tournament. Panzer is not sport, it's art. Maybe that explain the reason why they can fight in a town and even destroy houses with tanks fire haha. No seriously, if the development had been as original as the main idea, it would have been really great.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10 (x0.5) : The strong point in this anime. No details was forgotten, backgrounds are one of the most beautiful and detailed i've ever seen in anime. Tanks designs are great, and fighting with them in the snow was incredible for the eyes. I read that they used sophisticated software programs to synchronize the snowfall with the rest. Even without being connoisseurs, you will recognize the beauty of the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9 (x0.5) : Nice sound adaptation. I like the sound during fighting scenes, which mixes the old side of the tanks with the suspens of the fight. I was really impressed by the Russian songs too. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6 (x1.5) : Not so developed. The main protagonist is your average cute & shy girl, with  sides sometimes delirious, and is pratically the only one that the anime is developing. The second one that have caught my attention is Mako Reizei. His personality is really funny, but as i said, the anime is too much focused on the main character, even if you have some 'sides' stories with 2 or 3 others, like Hana Isuzu and her floral arrangements that causing troubles with her mother. But that's where they failed : If you want to develop a character, do it entirely. It would have been great to have a little more development on some secondary characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8 (x2) : I can not give below 8 with all the impatience I have between two episodes. This part is more personal, anyway I think anyone can really enjoy it like I am. Fights are well done, even if you can be sure of the final result of every fighting scenes (or maybe not for the final fight, wait & see). Suspens is not really intense, but still exist. You can have some laugh at some character's reaction too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7,5 : That fresh idea mixed to a beautiful artwork, sound, and some cute characters is really enjoyable. This anime is definitely not only for girls, even if it has this word in the title.\\n\r\n 'Will you sacrify your team-mates to reach victory?'\\n\r\n 'Are the traditions of family so important that you should consecrate all your life to it?'\\n\r\n These can be questions that this anime raise.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nAnime allows for many different combinations since what we view on-screen doesn't necessarily have to be ground to reality. In that regard, when you mix together cute girls riding in tanks, you get the anime known as Girls und Panzer.\r\nSTORY\r\nGirls und Panzer stars Miporin, a young girl who just transferred to a new high school and, upon enrolling, she is enlisted into the \"Tankery\" elective due to her supposed background in the field.\r\nWhat I found the show did nicely was its world-building. They actually introduced some interesting concepts regarding the use of the tanks and the lore behindthem. Much of the information regarding the tanks seemed to be at least legitimate or researched, and because of this, it allowed you to take its focus on the tanks seriously. As for Tankery, I felt that the \"game\" they created was well-thought out and explained nicely over the course of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the episodes focus on the battles that occur instead of on any actual plot. However, when they do try to inject some drama, it feels rather forced and out of place. Perhaps the problem was mainly due to the overall upbeat nature of the show. It doesn't take itself overly seriously, but when it tries to, it does not do a very good job.\\n\\n\r\nThematically, its main message is about how one goes about doing the thing they love. That is, everyone has their own style of doing things. I felt that the way they handled this was okay at best. I think the biggest problem is that the \"enemy\" in the show is never quite concrete enough in order for there to be any significant push-back. There is impending doom introduced later on in the series but it isn't tangible enough to feel like a threat to the characters and the plot overall.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the animation for the show is very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters move fluidly and in detailed ways. The tanks, likewise, do not actually seem out of place even though they are CG.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also did its best with cinematography, such as when placing the camera beneath the barrel of the tanks or from certain character perspectives.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the animation reminded me a lot of Highschool DxD; the show is generic looking but its animation is nicely done (for whatever reason).\\n\r\nAs for the art style, it was fine. It is nothing good nor bad, just satisfactory. I would have enjoyed more environments for the tank fights than given (less forests and more desert/swamp/mountainous), but the ones they showed were still fine (inner-city, snowy, etc.)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a lot of characters. Because of this, many do not get much screen time at all. And along the same note, that means hardly any of them see actual character development. Because of this, you do not care much for the characters present.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, they are all very cute for who they are. While trope-y, you like the emotionless Reizei, the mother-like Isuzu, and boy-loving Saori, etc. Even the other minor characters, such as the girl who always has one eye shut or the ever studious hall monitor. Having a cast of over 20 or even 30 characters, there is bound to be something for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, they do try to explore at least the main cast. Again, much of this development feels underwhelming and is lumped in with the melodrama that it tries to present. The problem with the show is that it really isn't looking to have complex characters at all. Its main focus is the girls fighting in tank battles. While I am perfectly fine with this, I still wish there would have been some meaningful growth with any of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were too generic for my liking.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the rest of the soundtrack was nicely done. This is mainly because of the ideas at play. That is, with the tanks and WW2 aspects, the pieces of music incorporate drums and trumpets that very much remind you of war. The soundtrack does a nice job of setting the mood, and in that regard I applaud them for it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, I found the roles to be fitting for the characters with no standout performances.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show that you really just watch to have a little bit of fun. The girls themselves are nothing like those from Monogatari or Nisekoi where they are either extremely well developed or incredibly likable. Instead, they are cute girls doing what they do best. And that is participating in a game that involves shooting tank missiles at one another. It can be funny at times and while the tension it stages is never overwhelming, they do a nice job of trying to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to Girls und Panzer, if you are looking for deep characters or a compelling plot, then you are looking at the wrong show. However, if you just want to sit back, relax, and watch girls drive some tanks, then this is the one for you.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, world-builds nicely but not much else\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, fluid character movements and well done tank battles\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, cute girls but nothing more to them\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, OP and ED forgettable but the soundtrack is not\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, cute girls plus tanks is somewhat fun to watch\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "A wonderful and outright perfect work of action-kawaii!\r\nI have watched a fair bit of anime on the theme \"cute girls doing badass things\", and I can easily say that this one does it so right. For a number of different reasons.\r\nFirst, it is knowledgeable in its topic. Other animes (not mentioning names) with a theme of warfare or anything taken directly from the real world sometimes miss the mark. They throw out a bunch of ladies with guns but have no idea how guns work. Their focus is all on the drama and enhancing the narrative, and the theme is only an intermediate. On theother hand, G&P tells you everything you need to know about tanks and tactics. There is no end to the characters discussing features and weaknesses with their vehicles and finding ways to engage \"like during the battle of Stalingrad\". The creators clearly sat for hours in WWII literature.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, it contains no gijinka. You can way what you want about the realism of high school girls driving tanks, but there is no per se unnatural or unhuman about the girls. They are not tanks in themselves. They cannot transform or use magic. They don't talk about the armor rating of their boobs. They are just normal human beings who happen to really like tanks. Without anthropomorphism, the suspension of disbelief is very easy to achieve for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThird, it is without romances and fan service. The creators do not want to show us curves or underwear, they want to show us people. This beautifully compliments the overall badass-y theme of tankery with these schoolgirls doing nothing more than girl power. There is not a single male character that I can remember, and even less so any signs of any of the mains falling in love. This is a very feminist anime that lets its women have their own story and do as they do.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, I will admit that the story is very cheesy. Everything that unfolds is more or less predictable in this kind of story. Not much backstory is told, and most mains are a bit shallow. If you are looking for story excitement or a waifu-worthy personality, look further.\\n\\n\r\nBut in my humble opinion, that is only part of the charm. Because how can you not love seeing a teenage girl yelling \"kawaii\" to a passing squirrel while simultaneously driving a tank towards battle?\\n\r\nThis anime does not try to be a compelling drama, it just aims to be a slice-of-life rhapsody of happiness and cuteness. It is a destination for simple pleasures and relaxing to a comfortable girly and still empowering adventure.\\n\\n\r\nGirls just want to have fun! With tanks!",

And I realized I didn't have that much fun for a looong time.\r\nABOUT STORY (8/10)\r\nThe story is pretty basic, tank driving is amazingly popular among schools and only girls do that, then they compete each other in tournaments etc. But there is so much soul in it and that makes you think yourself asone of the characters from the anime and eventually you enjoy it so much!\\n\r\nABOUT ART (10/10)\\n\r\nThe art style isn't like most of the modern animes so you may find it weird but IMO this style is the best for an anime like this. And about CG's they are really helpful to see the tanks/matches from different angles and that helps you understand better. \\n\r\nABOUT SOUND(10/10)\\n\r\nIt's just amazing lol.\\n\r\nABOUT CHARACTERS(9/10)\\n\r\nCharacters aren't really extra ordinary but the way they put them in the anime like they are actually real is amazing! Even though the anime is focused on tank matches they also show you everyday problems of the girls and that really helps you understand and empathize them.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT(10/10)\\n\r\nIt's been a long time since I was this excited and happy while watching an anime.\\n",

            "content": "Moe is a unique genre that only exist in Japanese entertainment. It has such a different nature, which makes the shows really difficult to evaluate: If we compare the plot with shows such as Death note... 0/10, If we compare action with shows such as Attack on Titans... 0/10. \r\nBut is it fair to ever look at shows like Girls Und Panzer on a critical stand point? I think not. It is not what the creators are trying to achieve, it is not what audiences are looking for either, at least they aren't supposed to. \r\nI guiltily admit Girls and Panzer is actually the oneand ONLY Moe show I have EVER watched in my life time. My judgement on it is purely based the little information and knowledge I obtained from some research I did through Google. Any constructive criticism is welcomed and will be greatly appreciated. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (Concept 4/5, Development 2/5)\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I decided to watch the show is because... TANKS! This is one of the few complete original ideas I've seen in recent years. In this world, girls driving tanks is a competition/art just like how we look at Karate and Swordsmanship. Different schools from different nation compete in bombing others just for the sake of entertainment! How is this not interesting?? \\n\\n\r\nSadly, the way they interpret the show is really... Boring. It is a super basic tournament process where the protagonists beat up various enemy and try to become the champion. Not a single unexpected element. Not even one. \\n\\n\r\nThe story runs like a general, one-after-another competitions with occasional development of friendships within the teams and a little bit of background stories mixed in. I'd say this is the superb boring version of Prince of Tennis. \\n\\n\r\nBut again, this is Moe. This is what the story is supposed to be. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (Design 5/5, Development 2/5)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in GUP is a prime example of quantity over quality. There are at least twenty girls I can identify with at least one line of description. \\n\r\nThis is including but not limited to the following: The try-hard protagonist, the brainless hyperactive, the big nice sister, the quite, smart one and the geek. In addition, stereotypical girls like the Americans, Russians and Germans all have their distinct personalities. \\n\\n\r\nAre the characters cute? yes they are. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the personal development, I acknowledge that each character received at least 5 mins of background story which certainly deserves some credit. None of them are interesting/exciting. The characters did change their attitudes and way of thinking, tho on a very minimal level. Miho for example, starts with doubt with herself, but eventually believes in the power of friendships. Cliche, but at least there is some development. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the characters are... many. And they are all different. That's good enough. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nGRAPHIC (Art 4.5/5, Animation 2.5/5)\\n\\n\r\nI must say I am very impressive by the art. The character design are very generic. But when I look closely I realized none, absolutely none of the 20 major characters has identical eye or hair shape. It only show that the production team actually put some effort into those character designs and that should be appreciated, I think. \\n\\n\r\nThe background... is meh. They look quite good, but really lacks detail and aristic element. too many random colors mixing up to form the landscape and the buildings are sometimes recycled art as well. But since the background barely has any screen time, thanks to the extremely large head those characters have, I'll let it slide for this one. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation in this anime is passable. All the tank scenes are fully render in 3D, but not in great 3D. The special effects are also mediocre. Occasionally the tanks make some seriously impossible/funny moves that make them look like bumper cars in the amusement parks rather than tanks... But it does its job as a Moe anime. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (OP/ED 2.5/3, OST 3/3, Audio??)\\n\\n\r\nNO NOT WATCH DUB. NO. They sound like mid-age moms trying to speak in little girls' voices. The dialogues aren't properly translate either, phrases such as \"I'm glad I was able to make friends.\" are literally everywhere. Just who on Earth says that? \\n\r\nThe Japanese is much more pleasant... \\n\\n\r\nThe Opening is great. They are actually quite memorable and catchy. With the cool little moe tone, it does enlightens my heart a little bit. The ending... Aside from the awfully accented English, is also fine. Perhaps it is just me first time looking at Moe songs so they are pretty memorable.  \\n\\n\r\nThe OST are freaking AWESOME. They have this glorious feeling mixed with happy, light melody. It is very well done, very fitting and memorable. On top of that, they add stereotypical but classic songs such as Katyusha which are really unique and mood boosting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nIt did make me smile a lot, the characters are quite cute. but knowing the ending before the second episodes and the general feeling of wasting time is kinda... boring? \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nI believe. I believe this is a well made anime with everything needed to make a interesting moe series. I would probably not watch it unless I feel absolutely bored and needs some time to kill. It is fun little series and it certainly enlightens my mood. \\n\\n\r\nPeace",

            "content": "Girls und Panzer is an anime from Actas Studio. What's that? You've never heard of Actas? Well, that's not surprising. They mostly do in-between animation and other secondary animation work for larger studios. The only anime I've seen, besides this one, where they were the main force is Tales of Phantasia. One other odd thing to note about this anime is that the series came out at pretty much the same time as the manga rather than one being based on the other. Well, let's take a look at Girls und Panzer and see how that worked out for them.\r\nOur story opens at Oarai girls'school, where they're reviving the ancient sport of tank fighting. Where was that when I was in school? Young Nishizumi Miho is told in no uncertain terms to take it as an elective, the student council isn't that clear on what the word \"elective\" means, since she's the only one in the school with any experience. She initially declines but gets coerced into doing it. As the only experienced person on her team, Miho is quickly elected to the commander's role and she has to win the national competition for reasons that I can't go into without giving spoilers. The problem is that the school's equipment is not the best out there, they're under-manned and most of the team is comprised of newbies. Does the premise sound familiar? Let me rephrase it a bit. \"A group of underdogs have to win the championship title at *insert game here*.\" It's the basic plot of virtually every sports film ever made. To be fair, there are some differences, and not just those based on the fact that the sport in question is fighting with tanks. There's a greater emphasis on tactics, there's no montage and the team isn't made up of a bunch of social misfits who come off as complete losers. So, while the plot is pretty typical in a lot of ways, it does offer something different. This anime also has some really funny aspects, one of the big ones being that one of Oarai's tactics is to send a small and maneuverable but under-powered tank to troll the enemy. It's both really funny and tactically effective. I really only have two problems with the series. The first is that the opening is weak. They start out with the girls first battle and flashback to how they got started, presumably to build intrigue, but it doesn't really work with the tone of the series. Which is an issue with the first episode as a whole. My other issue is just with the length. The story pretty much has to stick with the bare minimum since there are only a dozen episodes. For the time they have, they do do a really good job but they could've used four to seven more episodes to further develop things.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the characters, there's an unruly number in this. Just the Oarai team has thirty-two members by the end and there's not nearly enough time to give most of them even minuscule levels of development. Honestly, it seems like an odd decision. They're clearly not operating under the rules of reality. They could've just said \"in this universe the tanks are modified so that they only need one or two people to operate them\" and kept the number of actual characters much lower. It would be far from the most unrealistic thing in the anime. That being said, I do like the main cast. They're a fun and very entertaining group. I even like Saori, in spite of her annoying me at times. And they do do a pretty good job of giving most of the major re-occurring characters a sense of personality, even if they can't do a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this looks pretty good, overall. The tanks are really well drawn. The action sequences are excellent, especially the last one. There are a lot of nice details in the background. The character art is kind of a typical moe style, but it looks fine. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast in this is pretty good. Particularly Iguchi Yuka, Fuchigami Mai and Nakagami Ikumi. Which is pretty impressive when you consider that two of them have very few roles. I'm pretty sure the Russian that's used at one point is way off, though. I really liked the music in this, especially the triumphant Panzer driving song. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 3/10. There are some scenes that could be read that way, especially the one where Miho tells her tank's crew that she loves them, but there's nothing definitive. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's Girls und Panzer. It's a fun little anime with some good characters and great tank fights. It's not an accurate depiction of panzer warfare by any means, but it is highly entertaining. 8/10.",

            "content": "There\u2019s a reasonably well-justified tendency among anime fans to hastily dismiss the potential merit of any permutation of the whole \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d motif that\u2019s so nauseatingly ubiquitous in modern anime. In recent times, we\u2019ve had a spate of these lusterless shows - whether it be \u201ccute girls climbing mountains!\u201d or \u201ccute girls that are actually anthropomorphic guns or something!\u201d - and the results are nigh-invariably uninspired dreck that\u2019s not worthy of anyone\u2019s time. With this in mind, it\u2019s only natural to approach the simple premise of \u201ccute girls driving tanks\u201d with caution. It is against all odds, then, that Girls und Panzermanages to not only be worthwhile, but also one of the most consistently entertaining shows in recent memory.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer\u2019s story is a simple one. Schools from around the world compete in a sport called Sensha-do, or \u201cway of the tank.\u201d In this universe, \"tankery,\" as it is colloquially known, is seen as a dignified martial art that helps girls hone their grace and femininity. Miho Nishizumi, the protagonist of this story, was a very capable captain of Sensha-do in her previous school, but due to a traumatic experience in the semi-finals of the previous Sensha-do tournament, she distanced herself from the sport by transferring to a school that doesn\u2019t participate in the Sensha-do, \u014carai Academy. Unfortunately, her new school takes up Sensha-do soon after her arrival. Even more unfortunate is that the school council is aware of her accomplished past as a commander and coerce Miho into being the captain of this newly established Sensha-do unit. While the sheer implausibility and silliness of this premise can be seen as the show\u2019s greatest detriment, it is simply a plot device necessary to get the girls into some tank battles, which is definitely where this show shines brightest. \\n\\n\r\nThe tank battles, simply put, are amazing. Takaaki Suzuki, the military adviser for Girls und Panzer, shows a great understanding of the ins and outs of tankery. As the rules specify, each tank needs to be of World War 2 vintage or older. These tanks are presented with great accuracy and attention to detail, each one having their strengths and weaknesses based on their real life counterparts. The battles themselves are often loosely based on real historical battles, generally involving \u014carai playing the underdog, and each one taking place at various unique environments. The many distinct and varied locations coupled with the accurate depiction of each tank lends itself well to some genuinely engaging strategies, both from \u014carai and their opponents, and are genuinely exciting to watch. As these battles are loosely based off historic events, many of \u014carai's schemes mirror well-known strategic maneuvers and consequently remain both entertaining and satisfying to witness unfold. \\n\\n\r\nWith that said, this is hardly a serious anime about battling tanks; the excitement incited during these battles is enhanced twofold by how infectiously silly and fun the different girl's personalities are. In stark contrast to their competition, the girls of \u014carai Academy are a convivial bunch. They paint their tanks pink, do an embarrassing dance to improve morale, and cherish friendship over winning the match. Cheesy, right? Well, it is, but the show embraces this cheesiness in a way that makes it feel genuine and endearing. What makes Girls und Panzer\u2019s comedy so special is that it\u2019s never afraid to laugh at itself and how preposterous its premise is. Each tank on \u014carai\u2019s side has a team of operators amusingly framed around their unique clique. For example, one team is composed of gamers who approach Sensha-do in a similar way that one approaches a video game. Another team consists of history buffs who romanticize past historical battles and leaders, attempting to emulate them with their hilariously over-the-top antics. \u014carai\u2019s opponents are similarly depicted as caricatures of their respective nations, such as the British team being refined in composure and perpetually drinking tea during the match, or the cocky American team that stoops to utilizing underhanded tactics. The battles contain a fair share of unorthodox stratagems that contribute to this pervasive sense of fun as well. Even when the girls of \u014carai are up against seemingly insurmountable odds, the show never loses touch of its deft sense of humor.\\n\\n\r\nBut Girls und Panzer isn\u2019t all fun and tankery. During the time spent away from Sensha-do, the show does attempt to have a few more serious plot lines, which generally yields poor results. The show spends an inordinately long time attempting to set up its admittedly silly plot in a comparatively serious way, and falls flat on its face in doing so. Thankfully, this is only an issue for the first episode and a half, as the show picks up steam once it gets to the Sensha-do tournaments and generally takes itself less seriously. Due to the massive size of the cast, minor conflicts are dismissed almost as soon as they\u2019re introduced. For instance, one minor arc involves a character who gave up the family business of arranging flowers to take up Sensha-do. This is met with harsh disapproval from her family, but is soon after entirely dismissed after her parents watch one of her matches. There isn\u2019t any character development as the result of this, and the parent characters are never seen again in any meaningful context. It only serves as a shallow feel-good moment that slows down the momentum of the show. Most characters, while entertaining enough in the context of the group, are relatively two-bit and characterized solely by their unique quirk when looked at on their own merits. Miho is the only character to receive any real development, and even that plays out in a fairly predictable manner. However, these breaks from tankery only compose a very small fraction of the show. Most of Girls und Panzer\u2019s episodes are dedicated to their engaging tank battles and, provided one is enjoying the ride, it becomes possible to overlook their fleeting, minor flaws in storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and soundtrack are generally excellent and complement each other appropriately. The soundtrack marches with militaristic tunes that fit well with the action taking place on screen while the tanks are rendered using very detailed CG that looks great in motion. Unfortunately, some of the CG environments during the battles aren\u2019t as well-realized as the tanks are, often appearing flat with repetitive textures. This is most apparent during the earlier episodes, where it\u2019s clear that the production staff had a limited budget; CG heavy scenes are marred by a poor frame rate and the environments are at their worst. Fortunately, this is remedied as the show goes on and, by its final episodes, the show is an absolute delight to look at. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Girls und Panzer won\u2019t make you re-evaluate the way you view anime or present you with a profound take on life, but what it does do is present a thoroughly entertaining and refreshing variation on the whole \u201ccute girls doing cute things\" theme. Despite its flaws, Girls und Panzer\u2019s infectious silliness and engaging battle scenarios should have any viewer plastered with a permanent grin on their face, screaming \u201cPanzer Vor!\u201d for the duration of any given episode. It\u2019s a simple pleasure, but one well worth the time.",

            "content": "Story 8/10\r\nOther then the whole high school girl club about tanks aspect, the story is not very original, but I never really based the quality of an anime on how original its is, just how well executed it is and the story for Girls und panzer was pretty well executed. There were several conflicts and issues in the story that developed through the anime that were paced well. I found the ending quite satisfying. The scenes are well written and the whole anime had a nice pace that was comfortable, but not too slow either. The dialogue is good, even though both can get reallyreally cheesy at times (good thing I like it when a bit of cheesiness is thrown in). If you're looking for a story that's fun, has lots of action, and about friendship with a little drama thrown in, then this anime might be for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nI really like this art style. It was clean, simple, and smooth while being bright and colorful. It fits the light hearted feel of the anime. The tanks look great, but I not a tank expert so I do not know how accurate the tank designs are. What really impressed me about the art though was the backgrounds. The backgrounds have great detail, look good, and are some of the best I have seen. I hate it when an anime goes cheap on the background, so I'm excite that the Girls und panzer team put in the effort. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10 \\n\r\nThe anime focuses on building good groups and group dynamics. So none of the characters stand well on their own, but a tank in not operated by one person, but by a crew, so its cool that an anime about tanks focusing on the crew's overall personality rather then spending airtime focusing on each character that should be spent focusing on the crew being together. A lot of the characters are simply following their archetypes, so their not very original, but that is okay since they display their archetypes so well and in such a light hearted humorous fashion. I was surprised on how much I cared about the characters from the rival schools, since they didn't have a lot of air time, but they were snuck in here and there which helped with the continuity. So overall I really like the characters in Girls und Panzer, but I could how someone else could justify not really liking them at all.  \\n\\n\r\nMusic 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme are okay, but the background music is one of the anime's strong points. It just fits the anime so well. \\n\\n\r\nAtmosphere 10/10\\n\r\nThe music, the tanks, the tournament, the school clubs, everything in Girls und Panzer makes for a great atmosphere. I fell so alive when the military parade music comes on just at the right time. I don't know very much about tanks so I don't know if the battles are realistic, but I love them. During episode four I was like \u201chow are they going to get out of this\u201d like three times and they kept on surprising me. I was so excited.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer is lacking in a few parts, but I found the anime overall to be quite humors, cool, and sweet.  Girls und Panzer can also be quite funny at times too. If your into tanks, sports animes, high school club animes, cute high school girls, or animes about friendship then you might want to give Girls und Panzer a try.",

            "content": "Senshado. Tankery. The Way of the Tank.\r\n\u201cA strong, but delicate art that aims to make women more polite, graceful, modest, and gallant, both on and off the battlefield. To learn tankery is to armor the heart of a maiden, the soul that embraces and burns with femininity. Intense and strong like a tank's iron. Cute and lively, like the clattering of its track. And finally, passionate and precise, like its main weapon. If you train in tankery, you will become a better wife, a better mother, a better student, and a better worker. You will become healthier, kinder, stronger, and men from all over theworld will fall to your feet-\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWell, if that's not the most hilariously nonchalant, yet enticingly charismatic recruitment narrative I've heard for anything, ever, much less tanks. Sign me up- Wait a minute. I'm a man...\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer was directed by Tsutomu Mizushima and scripted by Reiko Yoshida. Character designs were done by Humikane Shimada. Produced by Actas as this studio's first independent work, we follow the story primarily through the perspective of Miho Nishizumi. Strong-armed by the Student  Council into joining Ooari's revived Tankery elective, Miho Nishizumi finds herself responsible, as the only individual on her team experienced with Armored Fighting Vehicle, or AFV, strategy and tactics, for leading her friends and other saps excited by the prospect of operating tanks, gaining credits, or becoming better women, to victory in the national Senshado tournament. If not, there's always next year, right? Why is Miho so knowledgeable about tank operations to begin with? Speaking of which, why is she, a Nishizumi no less, a familial relation to one of the oldest and most feared Senshado think tanks of Japan, here in Ooarai to begin with?\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to make this point clear: \u201cGirls und Panzer\u201d is not a play on \u201cGirls und Pantsu.\u201d Director Mizushima made in emphatic that he would tolerate no panty shots in his series. In fact, outside a couple of onsen scenes, which, aside for some minor cleavage, are rather tame in any event, there's little to no overtly skeevy fan service in this show at all, however cynically exploitative one may conceive the concept of female adolescents juxtaposed to military hardware. For all intents and purposes, Girls und Panzer is a show about girls and panzers, a show that combines slice of life and tank battles, and you know what? It works.\\n\\n\r\nHow? Because of how seriously and seamlessly the show engages in both premises, provided that people are willing to suspend their disbelief about the absurdity of teenage high school girls driving steel ton AFVs. Particularly pressing is the willingness to tolerate this show's usage of moe. Moe is a far encompassing term, but the majority of the anime community outside Japan's come to associate it with cute and often underage members of the female sex. In this context, moe in shows carries with it a rather negative connotation of shallow, white-knight fetishization when relied upon as the primary draw. To juxtapose full-on moe next to weaponry is another fetish entirely, and I don't fully disagree with that assessment. It certainly has some truthful merit, but it's also lead to an unfortunate overgeneralization that any show that contains cute girls and slice of life is meant to be fap material for pedophilic shut-ins. To characterize that stereotype to Girls und Panzer, I have one thing to that.\\n\\n\r\nNuts.\\n\\n\r\nIn context, this series has shown that it is perfectly mature enough to use both to drive part of its narrative and add depth as well as charm, because at the very most, it is only used as an element, and one that isn't imposing at that. Some of this medium's most universally celebrated shows have incorporated elements that are, without a doubt, superficial, and yet they remain lauded by many, because they were more than just that. Girls und Panzer should be considered no differently.\\n\\n\r\nSlightly less pressing, but still of utmost importance to understand is that, beyond rejecting or even merely tolerating this show's mainly predominantly female and adolescent cast, this fact should be taken with sensible humor. It's a universe where entire cities are straddled on giant aircraft carriers, where Senshado is a martial art, a pastime, and a sport where in-universe precautions are taken to ensure that casualties are rare, where the tank crews are staffed entirely by women because it's considered a womanly pursuit. Instead of scrutinizing on how situating cities on ships are possible, harking on tankery as a sport is stupid because it's dangerous in real life, becoming indignant on how it's making a derogatory statement of propaganda towards men, ask yourself... Does it matter? Is it explained in context? And honestly, do you think the staff, who happen to be filled with male individuals, is going out of their way to say that women are better than men, potentially alienate the very demographic that they know would make up the consumer base for their DVDs and BDs? It's funny, and it's even more so because the cast takes the world they belong to and the sport they participate in seriously, like it's a natural thing because to them, it is. That doesn't preclude taking everything this series has to offer with a grain of salt, only that we manage to see events from their perspective. By extension, it also applies to the other competitor schools, whose tank commanders are defined by nationalistic traits similar to the ones in Hetalia, though with more nuance and less homo, enough to be amusing without immersion-breaking.\\n\\n\r\nAlso an absolute joy, at least for similarly interested minds like mine, are the seamlessly integrated historical references scattered and layered throughout the series. If no one caught on to its invocation earlier on in this review, the original utterance of \u201cNuts\u201d was a famous response uttered by an embattled American general to his German counterpart regarding the latter's demand to have the Allied command stranded at Bastogne surrender during the Battle of the Bulge. Interestingly enough, the show makes that very same reference in Episode 9. If I was a girl in Ooari High School, I'd definitely would have found myself riding along in a StuG III. I'm a history enthusiast and war buff, and to pick out how much effort was spent in integrating these references into the show is outright outstanding. These references transcend not only utilize words; they transcend them. As samples, Episode 5 delves into the effect that intelligence gathering and deception has determining the currents of battle. Episode 6 goes into a totally fitting monologue on the history of the American M4 Sherman tank. Episode 9 demonstrates Soviet T-34 tank strategy in action and highlights the importance of morale during armed engagement, and Episode 11 makes a subtle reference to the Germany's lightning armored mobilization into the heart of France, bypassing the heavily fortified Maginot Line using the thickly wooded Ardennes Forest. Hell, one of the characters is based off Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.\\n\\n\r\nA delight for tank aficionados and a great source of tangential learning from everyone else are the tanks themselves. While originally made for anime goers, overtime, it's gotten attention and praise from many tank fans as well. Going so far as to hiring a military expert to advise its creators during production, this show has taken great pains to make sure each tank looks and runs as authentically as can practically be, from the stops of a Type 89 to the rivets of a Panzer IV. Some liberties no doubt were taken for entertainment value, such as tread speed and pressure fatigue, but, for the most part, it was dead on. The series goes so far as even to even illustrate the drawbacks of individual AFVs, such as the Type 89's pathetic show of firepower against most of its contemporary armor and the Porsche Tiger's awkward tendency towards engine malfunctions.\\n\\n\r\nBut how do these tanks look when animated? Fantastic. CG has always been a tricky technique to incorporate within cell, but here, not only do the tanks look absolutely fluid, rendered in CG, on the move, and scenic, rendered in cell, when they aren't. Not a significant detail is lost during these transitions, all of which to make the show that much more thrilling to the pupils. This isn't even mentioning how amazing the muzzle flashes, dust clouds, smoke screens, and shell bombardments look. In fact, the show's art, from the backdrops and set pieces, to the lighting and shading, are all just sights for sore eyes. And, for what it's worth, I think the character designs aren't half bad either, once you get used to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe tanks might look nice during a fight, but how's the actual fight itself? Rather than simply piling one bigger spectacle after another, the show goes out of its way to use strategy and tactics, the actual strategy and tactics of tank warfare to move the currents of battle from one point to the next. Offense vs defense. Open field vs urban combat. All-out assaults vs hit and run strafes. Team Formations. Rear Guards. Positioning. Scouting. Decoys. Feints. Traps. All of these maneuvers and more are utilized, taking into account mission objectives, area surroundings, general, specific, and overall tank characteristics, the most innovative of them responsible by Ms. Nishizumi and her knack for bold, unorthodox, but nonetheless wildly creative and effective solutions. That doesn't go to show everything she does is brilliant. She, as much as the other tank commanders, have their shares of brilliant moments and demoralizing blunders, but unlike the others, Miho, like all great and potentially great military leaders, is able to adapt to the fickleness of the battlefield and, with a little luck, turn temporary setbacks into permanent victories.\\n\\n\r\nLike candy, constant excitement proves tiring to audiences after a while of non-stop consumption. One answer to this dilemma is greater and greater amounts of spectacle to keep them interested at that same level. It gets to a point though where the previous spectacles become harder and harder to top, to the point that the next attempt might either end up a dud because of desensitization or be so ridiculous that it breaks immersion. Sole dedication to this method is especially troublesome for a series whose spectacle relies on some realism, like Girls und Panzer's tank battles. The other answer then is to generate pacing, to allow the audience to have lulls in their action so that the next action sequence that comes about feels that much sweeter to people. Girls und Panzer is an excellent example of good pacing, and it all stems from its slice of life. The show begins in media res, the hook, where we get a tempting taste of all the tanks rolling along. Then, we start at the top, getting grounded into the characters, the setting, and the situation, building up for another climax all the while. We get a match, then we get a break with the characters. We get another match, fight and flight, then another, rest and digest, one climax after another, until we get the final one and we're blown off our rockers, pumping our fists, gasping for breathe because of what was just witnessed, and it's significant because it's the first time those reactions happened with this much intensity. First times, just by their inherent nature, can be really intense.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters. Being that it is but one cour, the show can't afford to linger on any one person for too long without ruining battle momentum, considering how many of the girls take up the screen. Outside of Miho then, it relies on a principle that shows should be following more in the first place: \u201cShow, don't tell.\u201d Compared to other series, Girls und Panzer has much less verbal hand-holding. Off the field and especially on it, each vignette of these characters doing something carries with them precious statements that speak volumes about them on their own: their personalities, their proficiencies, their interests, their aspirations. Granted, outside of Miho and perhaps her personal tank crew, all four of these aspects are relatively simplified, but, using inference, they are simplicity thoroughly defined, and above all, a unifying message between all of them gets across. The message is especially poignant in Episode 5, where the Student Council shows Miho their memories of Ooari using a photo album. They never explicitly say that they love their school, but that right there is more than enough to convey to the audience, or at least to me, how much it means to them. This method of narrative also extends beyond to the plot, the tactics, and the tanks as well, so that not a single moment is wasted trying to explain something the viewers can contextually figure out on their own. None of it feels contrived, and you know what? I appreciate that the staff assumes us, or at least the majority of us, as intelligent enough to do some mental legwork.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it is, the character depth is fine the way it is, and any further fleshing out is better off relegated to future sequels. That being said, I do have one complaint about the characters in regards to their friendships, particularly the main heroines. It's a criticism that's more valid in the beginning, and it might be just my cynicism or ressentiment talking. They're a bit idealistic. To create such fast and true relationships with people to the point they are willing to give up their preferred elective and stand up against the Student Council with you despite having just recently met... I end up asking myself: Why have I never met friends like that? In addition, some of the character drama could be better executed, like Hana Izuzu's for example, as some of it seems rather sudden, even taking slice of life into account. That being said, both issues are far from enough to be a major detriment. I guess predictability in terms of storytelling and character development also may be a drag for some, but I've always considered the means rather than the ends to be something I take to heart more.\\n\\n\r\nOn the music side of things, I won't deny I'm rather partial to marches. Lighthearted yet prideful, dignified yet stirring, pompous yet boisterous, combined with the fact that they comprise the most memorable portions of the OST, original scores and borrowed ones, British, American, Russian, German, I found myself stomping my feet to them in rhythm fairly often. But more than how I like them on their own, I love how they are used in tandem with the show's visuals. Since there's only so many I can talk about, I'll try to keep examples controllable. My elation was rather high, for instance, when an abridged version of \u201cU.S. Field Artillery March\u201d by John Phillip Sousa was playing alongside a formation of moving Shermans. Then there's a lovely band arrangement and seiyuu vocal chorus of the popular folksong Russian \u201cKatyusha\u201d by Mantei Blanter and Mikhail Isakovsky to a mobile spread of Soviet armor. It's quite likely that some of the pronunciation may have been off, but from what I could tell, they tried rather earnestly to come close, and regardless, the singing's outstanding. Unfortunately, it was cut upon official release to international audiences due to private domain issues. Lest I forget is the anime original \u201cSenshado March: Panzer Vor!\u201d and its melodically constant derivatives by Shiro Hamaguchi. A love letter to of everything great about military marches, the steady cadence of snares and horned bass, the bombasts of cymbals, the blasts of trumpets, the tight, orderly frivolity of the piccolo, it's a wonderful piece that stands on its own to the classics.\\n\\n\r\nI'd be remiss to forget discussing the OP and ED, so, being obviously J-Pop, how do they hold up? For J-Pop, they hold up pretty well. The OP, Choucho's \u201cDreamrider,\u201d incorporates a nice rhythmic riff at the beginning and end reminiscent of march cadences, but it otherwise uses electric guitars, electronic synthetics, and drum sets, and the art and animation, scenic and fluid, outside introducing tank teams, hold no illusions in emphasizing what's given from the title. And yet, through, once again, a great use of pacing both from the great vocals and engaging visuals, everything feels very dynamic, like, suspension of disbelief withstanding, it's going somewhere good. The ED, \u201cEnter Enter MISSION!\u201d by the seiyuu of the main heroines, can't help but be incredibly charming in how competent, enthusiastic, and earnest the singers are, despite the sappy atmosphere. Plus, the visuals consist of chibi versions girls of the various Ooari armor crews riding in super deformed versions of their tanks. You'd have to be a pretty jaded and bitter anime fan not to crack a smile at that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, once one gets used to the aforementioned concerns, Girls und Panzer is a fun show that, while not incredibly \u201cdeep\u201d or complex, should be given credit as much for its technical precision and narrative intuition as well as its terrific music, its played-straight humor, its abundant historical references, its smart, well-paced, and exhilarating tank scraps, and yes, its cute, but never quite fetishized, high school girls.\\n\\n\r\nNow, time for some light historical research.\\n\\n\r\nI give Girls und Panzer an 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "Something that I have discovered whilst watching Girls Und Panzer is that trying to convince people that it is genuinely a fantastic show is nigh on impossible. I don't blame them, if someone had told me before I watched it that I'd be rating it an 8 and calling it a highlight of the year then I would have greeted them with a doubting look, wondering whether they were joking or whether they just had bad taste.\r\nIt's obvious why there's so much doubt, it's the premise. Cute girls driving tanks immediately brings up memories of shows of \"cute girls doing cute things\" or of \"Cutegirls doing [insert unusual activity here]\", both have which rarely produce anything other than mediocrity at best. With this overwhelming abundance of poor shows, the ability to believe that Girls Und Panzer could be anything other is incredibly difficult.\\n\\n\r\nBelieve me though, Girls und Panzer is really the diamond in the rough.\\n\\n\r\nThe natural question here is what sets it apart from the rest? To put it simply, it is its comedy, its earnestness, its action, but above all its execution. \\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer is a show with a ridiculous premise and setting, the show acknowledges this and embraces it to deliver great comedy. No matter how ridiculous the happenings or plot points, like friendly tank battles being held in town centres, or a man thinking it's good luck that a tank crushed his shop, it plays it straight and just lets you enjoy it, without it pointing the joke out to make sure you got it. It mocks clich\u00e9s by putting them into stupid contexts and then blowing them completely out of proportion. There will always be something there to make you laugh, the humour of the show is very consistent, and though it's not the biggest draw of the show, it's what helps to make the show so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are incredibly likable and work perfectly within the context of the show. There are a large number of characters, but every single one, whether it be someone on the Panzer squad or someone on the opposing team, will bring a smile to your face at some point. These aren't deep characters, but they don't need to be, they often have stupid and ridiculous traits, but that's the point, whether it be the girl who also sits on her lieutenants shoulders to put her above everyone because she's got a complex about being childlike, or the vice president who's usually calm and collected who goes crazy when she's battling in the tanks, they bring enjoyment by being so stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThe really surprising aspect about Girls und Panzer is how realistic yet still ridiculous the tank battles are. The people who choreographed the battles obviously knew the tanks involved inside out, providing startlingly realistic battles, all whilst the tanks are running around coloured bright pink or with Edo period flags. The battles are amazing in how much the intelligence of the realism and tactics conflicts with the bizarre and absurd nature of events.  You will be entertained, and there is sometime genuine tension in the battles, especially the later ones. The animation of the battles improves greatly as the series progresses, in earlier episodes the CGI looks awkward, but by the end it's much better and used very well with solid animation, providing fast exciting action. The camera angles are done very well, particularly in the last showdown where I can only say they were perfectly done.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation as a whole started off fairly average, but as the episode count increases it's obvious that the budget increased significantly, by the end the animation was excellent, it's visually appealing and there are no mistakes or off model characters. The soundtrack was strong on the whole, with some great military marches and themes that really added to the scenes and battles. The voice acting was strong, making sure to keep everything straight (and often hilariously over the top) so that the humour was conveyed correctly. The opening \"Dream Riser\" is an uplifting track which suits the series well, and the ending \"ENTER ENTER Mission\" is generic but rather catchy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm not saying that Girls und Panzer is the best show out there, but it executes what it's trying to do flawlessly. The show plays everything so honestly and with such earnest that you cannot be cynical about it, but wish to enjoy the show like it wants you too.  This show is really the height of entertainment, and during the weeks that I watched it, despite myself I grew to love the show more and more.\\n\\n\r\nYou may still be doubtful that Girls und Panzer is the brilliant show I'm painting it to be, but I whole heartedly recommend you go and give it a try, as it really is pure and enjoyable entertainment at its best.",

            "content": "This was better than I expected. The premise on this series is battles between groups of tanks as an after school club. In this crazy world, this is treated just as another sport which contributes somewhat to feminity. (I wonder what the hell would boys do, given the proper atention by the series: \u00bfkill each other?, \u00bflearn to cook?).\r\nArt gets pretty interesting when tanks are battling.\r\nAll related to tanks is ok and even seems well documented, but the slice of life with stribes on the girls seems to pale a bit in comparison. Take for instance a moment at episode two or three when thegirls hang out together: one girls wears contact lens, another has some utillage in her backpack, and when you think a dialogue will burst out... the scene ends. At least there's almost no slice of life, as this is mostly about battles.\\n\\n\r\nIt is obviously impossible to show a development for three to five girls in each of the five tanks (twenty people, if I recall). There are brief stories for three of the main girls. The story involves mostly a world competition.\\n\\n\r\nMusic could have been way more epic. Cute versions of belic themes are ok but not awesome. Check, for instance, Strike Witches OST. I would remark: the anglerfish dance and the russian song.\\n\\n\r\nGood:\\n\r\nThe tank action.\\n\r\nThey take this crazy world so seriously that it seems plausible.\\n\\n\r\nBad:\\n\r\nThe twelve episodes seem to be not enough: the show even skips one of the matches, just showing the resolution (seems it was later made into an OVA).\\n\r\nToo much miraculous shot evading gets notorious. Play a game of tanks and do as they do: you will get blown in three seconds.\\n",

            "content": "~Multilingual review, English & Espa\u00f1ol: Girls und Panzer~\r\nNowadays \"Cute girls doing cute things\" have become an unwritten genre, or better, a keyword that open a window through which we can imagine completely how it's going to be an anime, even if our knowledge about it are pair to zero, we could almost go far and state a \"first impression\" derived only by hearing those words. We tend to imagine a group of cute girls doing absolutely nothing, actually only cute things, or engaged in some particular activity, sometimes that unusual that we could consider them totally out of ordinary or from what we could call\"acceptable\".\\n\\n\r\nUsually \"cute girls doing cute things\" type of anime aren't serious ones, mostly comedy or Slice of Life, but there are sometimes that some of them breaks this, almost, rule. The good thing about them is that you could enjoy watching an unusual activity being done by a group of cute girls, and this time I came across something really particular... girls and tanks!, and believe or not, this was quite different from the ones I've watched before, this anime shown a great quality, unexpected differently from a \"cute girl doing cute things\". You won't find only cute girls driving tanks, in this show there's actually a deep and accurate understanding about tanks, actually this feels that different that there're hardly scenes portraying the typical cliche scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nFanservice is absent, there are no beach episodes, no thermal waters episode, no Cultural/Sport Festival, no pool episode, any kind of cliche scenario or situation that could expose the girls sex appeal are absent. There aren't fanservice yuri undertones and the girls never groped each other... I was quite surprised, as well as glad, and then again, quality was shown, this anime totally focused on what we came for: awesome battle with tanks.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around \"Sensha-d\u014d\", literally translated as \"the way of the tank\", and the girls who practices it. What would be that?, -Sensha-d\u014d is the martial art that strives to nurture polite, graceful, humble and brave maidens-, or in other words: Tank warfare with girls!. With that said, the story begins with the new Oarai High School transfer student, Nichizumi Miho, our protagonist, a Sensha-d\u014d veteran by then retired from the battlefields due to a traumatic experience in a competition. Oarai High School distinguish itself from not having Sensha-d\u014d classes.. or so Miho thought, but as soon as she arrives the student council decides to take it up and participate in the National Sensha-d\u014d Tournement. After the initial dubious state, Miho decides to give another chance to Sensha-d\u014d, and along her new inexperienced teammates, the National Tournament awaits, meanwhile unknown for our protagonists but no for us, the viewers, their School is about close if they don't win.\\n\\n\r\nAs you've probably realized, the story is quite simple and originality isn't by their side neither, there's practically none character development. If you ask me why such a high score for this anime, I would reply you with three strong points about it:\\n\\n\r\n1- Sensha-d\u014d\\n\r\n2- Really likeable group of characters\\n\r\n3- Focus on important things, leaving clich\u00e9 and fanservice totally outcast\\n\\n\r\nEven if I tend to like anime with more complicated plots, twists, ect, I need to say that Girls und Panzer \"plot development\" was carried in a wonderful manner, each episode was focused on the girls training, the realization of plans and strategies for the next battles, bonding, a quick but well done focus on the principal characters, and finally, great tanks battles filled with real accurate \"tankery\" and details, that's why I listed between the strong points Sensha-d\u014d, which doesn't refer only to the presence of tanks in the anime, it represents the quality of the show itself.\\n\\n\r\n\"Sensha-d\u014d isn't War!\"\\n\\n\r\nIt's a sport, and like every sport, there are rules to follow. I'll now explain briefly in what consist this sport and it's basic rules, just in case you were wondering how and why girls practice such dangerous activity, rest assured, this is actually a well planned sport, in correspondence to the quality level of this show, quite high:\\n\\n\r\n- Tanks admitted in battle are need to be prior Second World War.\\n\r\n- Shells are designed so that they can't penetrate the tanks's armor.\\n\r\n- Black boxes are equipped in order to declare the tank out of game wherever it's damaged by the counterpart.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two kinds of Sensha-d\u014d matches, \"Annihilation\" and \"Flag\". Just like it's name suggest, the first one consist in immobilize all enemy tanks by first, and the second one, Flag, consist in immobilize the enemy's Flagtank by first. Finally there's a restriction rule for the amount of tanks allowed in the National Tournement by each team, First round up to 10 tanks, Semifinals up to 15 tanks and Final up to 20 tanks. The matches are always 1 Team VS 1 Team.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonists teams, the Oarai High School team, consists of 5 tanks, later upgraded to 8. The characters operating them have their very own charming and characteristic, quite difficult to mistook one team for another. We've the protagonist's team operated by Nishizumi Miho, who acts as the Commander, like previously said, she's the only experienced one, the Loader, Akiyama Yukari, a tank otaku girl and the most charismatic character in the show, the Gunner, Isuzu Hana, a quite composed and high leveled head girl, the Driver, Mako Reizei, a quiet and gloomy girl but with a kind heart, and finally the Radio Operator, Saori Takebe, a girl who aims to be popular by any means. The other teams are operated by: the Student Council, since taking up Sensha-d\u014d again was their idea, another group consists of History fanatics, each one personalizing a famous past leader, another one consists of Tank Warfare Online gamers, and going on, the variety is assured. I won't write about all of them since the risk of this review becoming really large is quite high, but they are sure a bunch of mixed personalities.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to Animation and Sound this show couldn't offer for better, battle scenes are done excellent, even the CGI scenes were awesome and flowing, the designs were highly detailed and pleasant for the eyes, and I'm not talking only about the tanks design, also the environment and the battlefield were realized quite well. The Sound was something great, the OriginalSound Track was composed mainly by militaristic tunes quite adapted to harmonize the events in the show, and yet they had an unique but cute charming tune in them which totally fitted also the most passive scenes. They ranged from typical American military tunes to Russian ones, there were also Italians ones!. There was also a very nice musical arrangement of the popular Russian song \"Katyusha\", fitting the parade of the Soviet Team.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer is totally not your typical \"cute girls doing cute things\", it's technical and accurate understanding about tanks make this anime quite enjoyable, and surely, over the top compared to other anime with similar themes. Brilliant execution and development of Battles, along with a fantastic OST, great Animation and whiteout forgetting, a nice crew of High School girls, this anime surely deserve such a high score in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n[Espa\u00f1ol]\\n\\n\r\nHoy en d\u00eda \"cute girls doing cute things\" se convirti\u00f3 en un g\u00e9nero de por s\u00ed, o mejor dicho, una palabra clave que abre una ventana a trav\u00e9s de la cual nos permite, completamente, imaginar como ser\u00eda un anime a\u00fan si no tenemos conocimiento alguno sobre ellos, podr\u00edamos ir lejos y decir \"una primera impresi\u00f3n\" derivada s\u00f3lo al escuchar esas palabras. Tendemos a imaginar un grupo de chicas empe\u00f1adas haciendo absolutamente nada, de hecho s\u00f3lo cosas lindas, o en otras ocasiones empe\u00f1adas en actividades as\u00ed de particulares que las podr\u00edamos considerar fuera del ordinario, o de lo que podr\u00edamos llamar \"aceptable\".\\n\\n\r\nPor lo general \"cute girls doing cute things\" tipo no son serios, principalmente tratan comedia o Slice of Life, pero hay ocasiones en las cuales esta, casi, regla viene infringida. Lo bueno de este tipo de series es que puedes llegar a disfrutar viendo actividades muy inusuales hechas por grupos de chicas, y esta vez me tope con algo bastante particular.. chicas y tanques!, y cr\u00e9anme o no, esto estuvo bastante diferente comparado con las series que he visto antes, este anime demuestra una tremenda calidad, inesperadamente diferente de lo que se espera de un \"cute girls doing cute things\". Aqu\u00ed no encontrar\u00e1s s\u00f3lo chicas conduciendo tanques, en este anime hay de verdad un conocimiento profundo y meticuloso sobre tanques, de hecho esta serie es tan diferente a lo normal que no hay casi escenas mostrando el t\u00edpico clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nEl fanservice queda excluido, no hay episodios de playa, no hay episodios de aguas termales, no est\u00e1 el t\u00edpico Festival Cultural/Deportivo, no hay episodio de piscina, todo tipo de escenario clich\u00e9 o situaciones que expongan el sex appeal de las chicas fueron excluidas. No hubo yuri-fanservice y las chicas nunca se tocaron las unas a las otras... Quede sorprendido, al igual que agradecido, y repito, la calidad se hizo notar, este anime se dedic\u00f3 completamente a lo que hab\u00edamos venido a buscar: buenas peleas de tanques.\\n\\n\r\nLa historia gira entorno al \"Sensha-d\u014d\", traducido literalmente como \"la v\u00eda del tanque\", y las chicas que lo ponen en pr\u00e1ctica. De qu\u00e9 se trata?, -el Sensha-d\u014d es la arte marcial que se empe\u00f1a a cultivar educadas, graciosas, humildes y valerosas doncellas- o en otras palabras: Guerra de tanques entre chicas!. Dicho esto, la historia inicia con la nueva estudiante transferida de Oarai High School, Nichizumi Miho, nuestra protagonista, una veterana del Sensha-d\u014d, ya retirada del campo de batalla debido a una experiencia traum\u00e1tica en una competici\u00f3n. Oarai High School se distingue por no tener un curso de Sensha-d\u014d.. o eso Miho pensaba, no pas\u00f3 mucho antes de su llegada que el consejo estudiantil decide iniciar un nuevo curso e inscribirse en el torneo nacional de Sensha-d\u014d. Despu\u00e9s del inicial rechazo, Miho decide darle otra oportunidad, y junt\u00f3 con sus nuevas compa\u00f1eras, del todo novatas, el torneo nacional les espera, mientras que desconocido para las protagonistas pero no para nosotros espectadores, su escuela ir\u00e1 en la ruina si no consiguen ganar.\\n\\n\r\nComo probablemente habr\u00e1n deducido, la historia es bastante simple, y la originalidad no est\u00e1 siquiera de su parte, tampoco hay desarrollo de personajes. Si me preguntan porque una nota tan alta para este anime, te responder\u00eda con sus tres puntos fuertes:\\n\\n\r\n1- Sensha-d\u014d\\n\r\n2- Un grupo realmente agradable de personajes\\n\r\n3- Enfoque total en las cosas importantes, dejando clich\u00e9 y fanservice completamente fuera\\n\\n\r\nAunque s\u00ed tienden a gustarme anime con una historia m\u00e1s complicada, llena de twists, ect, necesito decir que el desarrollo de la trama de Girls und Panzer fue llevada a cabo de una manera excelente, cada episodio estuvo enfocado en el entrenamiento de las chicas, la realizaci\u00f3n de planes y estrategias para las pr\u00f3ximas batallas, al desarrollo de grupo, a un r\u00e1pido pero eficaz acercamiento a la vida de las chicas, y finalmente, geniales batallas de tanques, llenas de detalles realmente precisos, fue por eso que la agregue el Sensha-d\u014d entre los puntos fuertes, el cual no se refiere solamente a la presencia de tanques dentro del anime, m\u00e1s bien representa la calidad del mismo.\\n\\n\r\n\"Sensha-d\u014d no es la Guerra!\"\\n\\n\r\nEs un deporte, y como todos los dem\u00e1s, hay reglas que seguir. Ahora explicare brevemente en que cosa consiste este deporte y sus reglas b\u00e1sicas, s\u00f3lo por s\u00ed estas curioso como y porque estas chicas hacen una actividad as\u00ed de peligrosa, pero sin preocupaci\u00f3n, este es un deporte planeado en el m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo detalle, el cual corresponde al nivel de este show, bastante alto:\\n\\n\r\n- Est\u00e1n admitidos s\u00f3lo tanques precedentes a la Segunda Guerra Mundial.\\n\r\n- El proyectil est\u00e1 dise\u00f1ado en modo tal que no penetre la armadura del tanque.\\n\r\n- Cajas negras son instaladas con el fin de poner fuera de juego un tanque que ha recibido da\u00f1o por el enemigo.\\n\\n\r\nHay dos tipos de encuentros en el Sensha-d\u014d, \"Aniquilaci\u00f3n\" y \"Bandera\". Justo como de puede deducir de los nombres, el primero consiste en inmovilizar todos los tanques enemigos por primero, y Bandera consiste en inmovilizar el tanque-bandera por primero. Por ultimo hay una regla que pone un techo al n\u00famero de tanques que se pueden usar en el Torneo Nacional por cada equipo, el Primer Round permite hasta 10 tanques, la Semifinal permite hasta 15 tanques y la Final hasta un m\u00e1ximo de 20. Las batallas son siempre 1 Equipo VS 1 Equipo.\\n\\n\r\nNuestros equipos protagonistas, el equipo de Oarai High School, consiste de 5 tanques, despu\u00e9s agrandado a 8. Los personajes que los operan tienen su propio \u00fanico carisma y caracter\u00edsticas, imposible confundir un equipo con otro. Tenemos al equipo protagonista, operado por Nichizumi Miho, como dicho anteriormente, es la \u00fanica veterana del grupo, ella hace de Comandante, despu\u00e9s tenemos al Cargador, Akiyama Yukari, una chica Otaku de tanques y la m\u00e1s carism\u00e1tica del todo el show, el Artillero, Isuzu Hana, una chica bastante madura y compuesta, el Conductor, Mako Reizei, una chica callada y algo sombr\u00eda pero de coraz\u00f3n amable, y por \u00faltimo el Operador Radio, Saori Takebe, una chica que busca ser popular a cualquier costo. Los otros equipos son operados por: el Consejo Estudiantil, dado que fue de ellas la idea de iniciar con el Sensha-d\u014d en su escuela, otro grupo consiste en fan\u00e1ticos de Historia, cada una de ellas esta metida en un comandante famoso del pasado, otro grupo estaba formado por gamers de juegos sobre tanques Online, y v\u00eda diciendo, la variedad est\u00e1 asegurada. No escribir\u00e9 sobre cada uno de ellos pues el riesgo que esta rese\u00f1a se convierta en algo bastante largo no es poco, pero les aseguro que se trata de un grupo compuesto por una complicada variedad de personalidades.\\n\\n\r\nSi venimos a la Animaci\u00f3n y al Sonido, en este show no pudieron haber de mejor, las escenas de combatimiento fueron hechas excelentes, al igual modo tambi\u00e9n las de CGI, que fueron de verdad geniales y fluidas, el dise\u00f1o fue altamente detallado y agradable a la vista, y no estoy hablando s\u00f3lo de los tanques, tambi\u00e9n el ambiente y los campos de batalla fueron realizados bastante bien. El Sonido fue algo especial, las Original SoundTrack fueron principalmente de tono militar, adaptas completamente a armonizar con los eventos que suced\u00edan en el anime, y a\u00fan as\u00ed llegaron a tener ese tono \"lindo\" que acompa\u00f1aba las escenas m\u00e1s pasivas. Abarc\u00f3 desde tonos militares t\u00edpicos Americanos a tonos t\u00edpicamente Rusos, hubieron tambi\u00e9n algunos Italianos!. Estuvo presente tambi\u00e9n una muy buena adaptaci\u00f3n de la famosa canci\u00f3n rusa \"Katyusha\", la cual acompa\u00f1o la avanzada del equipo Sovi\u00e9tico.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer no es m\u00ednimamente el t\u00edpico \"cute girls doing things\", su tecnicismo y precisi\u00f3n en materia de tanques y combatimiento lo hicieron demasiado entretenido, y seguramente, lo colocaron en un podio m\u00e1s alto comparado con otros anime de similar contenido y temas. Brillante ejecuci\u00f3n y desarrollo de batallas, seguido delicadamente por una fant\u00e1stica OST, Animaci\u00f3n genial y sin olvidar un muy agradable grupo de chicas, en mi opini\u00f3n, este anime de verdad merece esta nota alta.",

            "content": "A particular scene in Girls und Panzer always struck me as the most beautiful thing animated. Reizei Mako is a loli with black hair; she wears a white headband and goes to school. The problem is she\u2019s often sleepy and is always late for school. The other members of the cast are worried because they need a teammate for their panzer team (more on that later). Mako is perfect for the role of the driver. But once again, on the day when she is needed, she is still sleeping in her comfy bed. Nishizumi Miho, the protagonist, with her brownish-orange hair decides to wake herup osananamiji-style. In the early morning, cuckoos and alarm clocks cry out to wake Mako up. Yet, she is still asleep. Miho drives a panzer and shoots a bullet into the sky, waking Mako up from her dreams.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the ingenuity of Girls und Panzer. It is the ultimate form of cute girls doing cute things; it\u2019s self-aware of its silliness and plays on it.\\n\\n\r\nIn the setting of Girls und Panzer, Sensha-do or Panzerfahren is considered a ladylike sport. Flower arrangement is one thing, but driving panzers is something else. It apparently makes you a strong, independent female. A competition of the best schools with panzers is held. It is where Girls und Panzer takes its ride to us.\\n\\n\r\nFusing the sports and cute-girls-doing-cute-things genre, this show takes its absurdity to the max. It is comparable to a flat-chested-lesbians-playing-mahjong anime titled Saki and a certain scientific work. You know they\u2019re slice-of-life. However, these shows don\u2019t pretend they\u2019re intelligent. In Garupan\u2019s case, it has girls driving panzers. It\u2019s silly plus intense.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it knows how to make the work intense.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the tournament starts, you are immediately diving into a battlefield of panzers shooting left and right. One of the greatest things in Garupan is its sound design. Its quirky anthem-like soundtrack coupled with the noisy sounds of bullets shooting and tracks rolling create this jarring (and hilarious) sensation that war can be amusing. Think back to your war movies. While there are films like Full Metal Jacket that are funny, they haven\u2019t played on the fact the act of war itself is funny. Few works have done that and this silly anime is one of them. And to do it mostly by sound is a giant accomplishment. Try turning off your video feed: you would still feel the greatness of Garupan. The sound design adds to the epic scale of these battles and it\u2019s something worth commending for.\\n\\n\r\nDuring these battles, Miho stands out as an incredible protagonist. In sports works, we always get the hot-blooded shounen (who\u2019s probably a bishie). Sometimes, we get the overpowered character who can summon the winning hand with 1MP. Not Miho. She\u2019s just smart and can adapt to anything. Her tactics, just like the show, are ingenious. Who would have thought of tank drifting? Miho, of course.\\n\\n\r\nBut inside these panzers are girls and girls like cute things. Director Mizushima Tsutomu (Joshiraku, Another) likes cute girls who like cute things. He knows that this show needs some breather episodes. They\u2019re not actually fanservice, but they are showing us the world-building in Garupan. Yukari, a giant panzer geek, brings the cast to a shop dealing in panzerfahren items. We get the cute-girls-doing-cute-things antics here. Instead of getting turned off, people will find it too surreal (and therefore, enjoyable) seeing these girls get excited about panzers.\\n\\n\r\nThis makes me wish more people should pick up this masterpiece. It reminds us entertainment is just as artistic and creative as artsy animes. A giant world waits for us despite being inferred in a mere twelve episodes. It\u2019s a refreshing look on how the cute-girls-doing-cute-things genre can change. So grab the Commie subs, some popcorn, and cry out these two words: \u201cPanzer vor!\u201d",

            "content": "\u201cGirls und Panzer\u201d, Girls and Tanks (Panzer - taken from the German language), can be considered as one of the few anime which truly sticks to the title. At first glance, it can be said that this show is all about \u2018cute girls competing each other with tanks\u2019. To some it may sound amusing, while for others it might seem as another tedious work. \r\nThe anime is set in the future (some few decades from now) where tanks are obsolete and are at girls\u2019 disposal for honing their skills in Sensha-do (Way of the Tank). We have our protagonist Miho Nishizumi, driven from her pasttraumatic incident, transferring to Oarai High School. Coming from a family renowned for its Sensha-do, Miho is immediately beguiled by the student council into joining Sensha-do. With an example of Bushido (Way of the Samurai) Sensha-do is introduced here, which is depicted by this show quite fairly.\\n\\n\r\nComing back to the story, Miho who has joined Sensha-do is teamed up with the four deuteragonists. With the forming of rest of the teams the student council aims for the championship title, which will be held pretty soon. Oarai High School or moreover the student council has taken the initiative of starting Sensha-do again after a 20 year gap due to certain circumstances. From here on the story continues on showing the hardships met by these girls and how they make their way through each victory.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story is concerned, Girls und Panzer is as passable as any other mediocre anime. Now that being said, there is a ludicrous element in the anime which needs to be brought into light. To my knowledge, one needs to invest an ample amount of time in honing his/her skills to operate a tank, which is attained here by the girls quite effortlessly. Yeah, practice sessions are held here from dawn to dusk. Nonetheless, this is no feat one can achieve by practicing a month or two. Another surreal situation I came across whilst watching the show \u2013 they were allowed to continue their fights in a residential area and the girls were left unscarred even after getting a direct hit. I was completely dumbstruck after watching this and I don\u2019t think there is a need for an argument here.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as \u2018Girls und Panzer\u2019 lacks in the story, it offers a pretty commendable work in the art section. The animation is the most appealing aspect of this anime. Bright and colorful surroundings along with well sorted out landscapes adds up in making it livelier. There might be some dubious stunts performed, however that will be overlooked by intense and fluid action sequels. Praiseworthy here is the detailed and intricate design given to each tank. You will be able to easily distinguish each tank from a far distance. One might even say that maximum amount of time was invested on tanks, as they are one few things this anime has to offer. Character designs are well done. Each character is clearly defined with a different hairstyle and color helping us in easily identifying them.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are the only ones you can look forward to. Each of them is given a background, but not to the mark of your satisfaction. The problem of having so many main characters is that they need to have a story to fill in their past. Then again providing a story would mean extra episodes, which is not an option here. All the side characters are present just to fulfill their purpose in the story. However there is a certain degree of calmness or you can call it \u201cmoe-ness\u201d that will make you feel relaxed. The amalgamation of cute characters and good VA make them adorable to look at.\\n\\n\r\nIt takes a lot of effort in making the sound quality as good as the animation. Many anime fail to deliver that satisfactory mark and this one partly does the job. Each shot from a tank is clearly audible and the engine sound of each tank is distinct enough to be told apart. A good sound in coherence with interesting action scenes makes it a deserving watch. \\n\r\nThe seiyuu did a pretty good job, albeit having very little to adapt from their roles. The OP and the ending themes are good as well, and do contribute to the ambiance of the anime. \\n\\n\r\n\u2018Girls und Panzer\u2019 is an anime you should consider as a light watch. Expectations from the story will leave you disappointed and when you, on the other hand, have nothing to expect from it, you will be astonished by its detailed art and good action scenes. If you are willing to cast aside your affection for a good story, then you might end up having a fun time. \\n\\n\r\nHope you liked the review. Please don\u2019t refrain from pointing out any mistakes (either grammar or argument).\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nStory:               5/10\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 7.5/10\\n\r\nCharacter:       5.5/10\\n\r\nSound:              7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:      6.5/10\\n\r\nOverall:           6.5/10",

            "content": "One of my older reviews that got removed. Back for your amusement.\r\nOverview:\r\nToday we look at one of the silliest anime to come out in recent years! Girls und Panzer ist ein anime about frauen zat drive panzers! Each Panzerbesatzung (tank crew) consists of little moe girls that make otaku go \"awwww\". There is also lots of ww2 tank porn that appeals to armchair army geeks that have played WAY too much World of Tanks and now consider themselves military experts. \r\nPlot: 5/10\r\nThe plot is that tank combat between teams is now a sport, and girls rather than guys are the primary participants of this activity.This plot will no doubt remind older anime fans of \"fighting robot sports\" anime like Zoids Zero and G Gundam. The problem with this besides the obvious safety issues, is that WW2 tanks were extremely different in quality and purpose. If one team is using tanks so shitty that they can't possibly win, than it defeats the purpose of a sport. A team using Japanese model type 95s wouldn't be able to put a dent in a team using Panthers, and their armor would be shredded like wet tissue paper. It would be exactly like Jesse Owens racing against President Roosevelt. Tank warfare in WW2 actually boiled down to boring logistics and things like manufacturing cost, fuel efficiency, ease of use and requisite training hours. That is why tanks like the M4 Sherman and especially the T-34 were considered the best of the war. They could be made at a 5:1 ratio against the massive German tanks like the Tiger, but still had decent quality, were easy to use (especially the T-34), and didn't drain fuel as badly. None of this is adequately captured in G&amp;P, where each team uses roughly equal numbers and has the same amount of fuel and training hours. With these conditions the team using logistically terrible but awesome 1 on 1 tanks like the King Tiger would just win virtually 100% of the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are largely uninteresting moe jailbait. The show should have educated viewers by having all the girls named and modeled after famous WW2 tank commanders. I would love to see a \"3 Stooges\" dynamic between Patton, Zhukov, and Walter Model. That would have been hilarious! Guderian should be the main character, who is totally brilliant, but a vain asshole completely indifferent to any suffering around her. Think Dennis from Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Guderian is on a team with the morally dubious Von Mannstein, the flat out evil Model (whom something bad happens to in every episode), and Rommel (who is the only likeable girl on the team along with being the comedy \"straight man\". Rommel is always trying to apply for a transfer. Our team is up against the American team led by the foul mouthed Patton, who is a few cards short of a full deck, as well as the amiable and frustrated Eisenhower, who is forced to deal with Patton's bullshit every episode. The Soviet team is led by Zhukov, who is a brilliant general, but her school's principal Mrs. Stalin is always giving her idiotic orders. Most of her crew are poorly trained to utterly incompetant, so she resorts to drinking...a lot!\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack largely consists of ear grating, high pitched, school girl renditions of WW2 songs like Katyusha and Panzerlied. Thank fucking GOD we didn't have to hear a school girl rendition of Horst Wessel Lied. That song makes my blood boil when it isn't being sung by obnoxious little girls!\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime had an interesting idea and could have appealed to history fanatics MUCH better than it did. Unfortunately, I don't think it was well executed and ended up being forgettable and mediocre rather than brilliant insanity like it clearly wanted. If the studio ever wants to make a reboot, I would be more than happy to helm the project. As long as I can get WW2 historian David Glantz to be the series narrator.",

            "content": "First of all, I know the series isn't fully out, but this is what I've gathered from what I've watched.\r\nI'm impressed with the way the Panzer IV Ausf. D and the StuG III looked. Was also great see the M3 Grant (going off of the Lee having 7 crew members and the Grant having 6, but that could be developer oversight or crew shortage) and Panzer 38(t) getting some love. The sounds are also decent, not quite there, but that'd ruin the atmosphere of the show.\r\nCharacter design and story are lacking, but its your typical moe blob, so thats that. But as the later episodescome out, the story may or may not improve. Hoping they'll explain how they stay safe inside the tanks while they are shooting AP and worse case APCR rounds at each other. And non-penetrating rounds could still cause spalling, and that's almost worse than getting penetrated.\\n\\n\r\nAlso since they've show M4 Shermans and the Panzer VI Tiger, I wonder how long they're going to have the 75mm/L24 (Since it wasn't designed for tank killing), and upgrade to the 75mm/L43 or L48.\\n\\n\r\nBut only time can tell how the rest of the show is going to pan out, and I'm eagerly awaiting the next episodes. I'll probably do another review at the eighth and twelfth episode marks. Till then~",

            "content": "Girls und Panzer is a running joke that never delivers its punch line, and that is why the show is a masterpiece. One its surface, Girls und Panzer appears to be another \u2018cute girls doing cute things\u2019 anime with the cute thing this time being riding and fighting tanks. That\u2019s the joke. The underlying premise is so ridiculous and absurd that you can\u2019t not find it funny. However, this anime will play it straight faced for all 12 episodes, but it\u2019s still a joke. This anime enrapture you with breathtaking tank battles, clever comedy and surprising drama, but it\u2019s still a joke. The fact thatGirls und Panzer transcends the joke that is at the core the anime into an amazing show makes this a must watch for those who love anime and especially those who love good storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer\u2019s biggest strength is its tank battles. The battles themselves have good pacing that allows for the creation suspense that feels appropriate and adds to the entertainment value. Because tankery is a high school club in Girls und Panzer, it comes with rules in its conduct and victory criteria. These rules are simple to understand, internally consistent and clearly allow for upsets to occur. These rules allow the viewer to understand what the girls are trying to achieve in their battle plans and make the upsets that do occur completely believable. The tanks themselves are historically accurate. Tanks with heavy armor will have tank rounds bounce off, but they will also be slow because of that armor. Many of the WW2 era tanks are showcased at some point in the show and tank buffs will enjoy looking for their favorite tanks.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are solid, though they do not stand out compared to other anime. But with Girls und Panzer\u2019s focus being the tank battles, the main characters are developed well for the time they have and do add to the show. The side characters are ridiculous, but the show is inherently ridiculous so it doesn\u2019t feel odd. They do add a spice to the show that is enjoyable to watch, especially in the first few episodes. The other teams represent various countries in both the tanks they use and the stereotypes of the people on it. Those characters are always fun to watch in the brief appearances they make.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer also resonates with me for personal reasons. My job is to command tanks in combat. This anime is able to capture the trill of firing the main gun of a tank and how awesome it is to maneuver tanks against an enemy force. Fighting in tanks is fun (at least in war games), and this anime shows that. It even shows how much it sucks to fix a tank when breaks down in the field.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I understand that not everyone will love this anime as much as I do, I\u2019m sure that most people will enjoy watching Girls und Panzer and have no regrets doing so.\\n",

            "content": "Guter Tag allen von Ihnen, sorry about that I still have that German thingy after watching the last 2 overdue episode of this 12 episode anime, and btw I hate the way studio Actas have to delay it for 2 months. Ok so now this anime has come to an end, how do I rate this anime?\r\nHere's how:\r\nStory: Sch\u00f6n 6.\r\nThe story plot was very simple yet entertaining, there isn't any profanity nor does it have any violence, the whole plot revolves around the girls of  \u014carai Girls Academy who are member of the newly revived sport called \"Sensha-d\u014d, \" as well as the lifeof one particular group of friends who was headed by  Miho Nishizumi as they go through a lot of struggles in winning the Sensha do national tournament. Yet, the story is also about some trivia about the tanks that were involved in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Ein 3.\\n\\n\r\nI have no qualms about the tanks illustrations, in fact the way the tanks were drawn are with in the realistic concepts of what they look like during World War 2. So the rating was for this anime's design of the character's which the heads are way too big for the body.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sch\u00f6n 6.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say that I like the opening and closing themes, but I do have concerns about Hana Isuzu's seiyu, Mami Ozaki, Yukari Akiyama's seiyu, Ikumi Nakagami, and Kay's seiyu, Kawazumi Ayako, the said character's seiyu just don't have that youthful tone in fact they sounded like Milfs than teenagers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, enjoyment and overall: Gut 7.\\n\\n\r\nI guess you might say that the character's though awkward by design do have their cutsy side especially when it involves them supporting each other, though there was that moment that I would have wish for Miho to reprimand Anzu for keeping a secret at first. The enjoyment part was the tank battle where nobody dies, since it was suppose to be a wholesome thing, so overall this anime was wholesome enough to be watch by anybody who doesn't mind an oxymoron combination of something sweet with controlled violence,   thought a PG rating should be in place for kids who are 11 and below.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTank trivia:\\n\\n\r\nThe MAUS or \"Panzerkampfwagen VIII\" never entered combat service, after the war the only 2 prototype were captured by the allies. The tank itself was a technical failure from the beginning since no there are engine available to power it.  \\n\\n\r\nLegendary tank general Heinz Wilhelm Guderian once oppose the construction of new heavy tanks like the Tiger I and II  due to it's cost and impracticality and instead favors the construction of massive numbers Panzer IV tanks.\\n\\n\r\nBoth Tiger I and II have proven to be prone to certain types of track failures and immobilization, and limited in range by its huge fuel consumption.\\n\\n\r\nGerman tank crews would sometime mount tank tacks on the sides of their turrets as added protection against anti tank guns.\\n\\n\r\nSoviets would  hurl molotov cock-tale behind tank's turret as a way of immobilizing a German tanks, since it  is often where the engine exhaust and ventilation systems are located.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Soviet T-5455 was the most produced tank during the cold war.\\n\\n\r\nThe used of smoke to confuse German Armor was employed by American tank divisions.\\n\\n\r\nThe Flak 88 was initially designed to be uses against aircraft, eventually it was Field Marshall Erwin Rommel who thought of using it against allied tanks during his North African campaign , which later on, led tank designers to mount it in a Tiger as its primary armament.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Girls und Panzer. I never thought I would be attracted to an anime where there's no boy, I mean an anime that seems to be for girls. After watching some minutes, I saw that it has a male demographic in mind.\r\n Honestly, i firstly watched this for the beautiful artwork, and thinking there will be some fanservice, and now i'm following this for other reasons. Believe me, this is REALLY addictive.\r\nStory - 7 (x1.5) : Girls fighting with tanks, what an original and strange idea right? What miss in it, is the development. Let me explain : in any sport anime you'll see that: a meeting of several people who, by building strong relationship, decide to participate in a tournament. Panzer is not sport, it's art. Maybe that explain the reason why they can fight in a town and even destroy houses with tanks fire haha. No seriously, if the development had been as original as the main idea, it would have been really great.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10 (x0.5) : The strong point in this anime. No details was forgotten, backgrounds are one of the most beautiful and detailed i've ever seen in anime. Tanks designs are great, and fighting with them in the snow was incredible for the eyes. I read that they used sophisticated software programs to synchronize the snowfall with the rest. Even without being connoisseurs, you will recognize the beauty of the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9 (x0.5) : Nice sound adaptation. I like the sound during fighting scenes, which mixes the old side of the tanks with the suspens of the fight. I was really impressed by the Russian songs too. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6 (x1.5) : Not so developed. The main protagonist is your average cute & shy girl, with  sides sometimes delirious, and is pratically the only one that the anime is developing. The second one that have caught my attention is Mako Reizei. His personality is really funny, but as i said, the anime is too much focused on the main character, even if you have some 'sides' stories with 2 or 3 others, like Hana Isuzu and her floral arrangements that causing troubles with her mother. But that's where they failed : If you want to develop a character, do it entirely. It would have been great to have a little more development on some secondary characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8 (x2) : I can not give below 8 with all the impatience I have between two episodes. This part is more personal, anyway I think anyone can really enjoy it like I am. Fights are well done, even if you can be sure of the final result of every fighting scenes (or maybe not for the final fight, wait & see). Suspens is not really intense, but still exist. You can have some laugh at some character's reaction too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7,5 : That fresh idea mixed to a beautiful artwork, sound, and some cute characters is really enjoyable. This anime is definitely not only for girls, even if it has this word in the title.\\n\r\n 'Will you sacrify your team-mates to reach victory?'\\n\r\n 'Are the traditions of family so important that you should consecrate all your life to it?'\\n\r\n These can be questions that this anime raise.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nAnime allows for many different combinations since what we view on-screen doesn't necessarily have to be ground to reality. In that regard, when you mix together cute girls riding in tanks, you get the anime known as Girls und Panzer.\r\nSTORY\r\nGirls und Panzer stars Miporin, a young girl who just transferred to a new high school and, upon enrolling, she is enlisted into the \"Tankery\" elective due to her supposed background in the field.\r\nWhat I found the show did nicely was its world-building. They actually introduced some interesting concepts regarding the use of the tanks and the lore behindthem. Much of the information regarding the tanks seemed to be at least legitimate or researched, and because of this, it allowed you to take its focus on the tanks seriously. As for Tankery, I felt that the \"game\" they created was well-thought out and explained nicely over the course of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the episodes focus on the battles that occur instead of on any actual plot. However, when they do try to inject some drama, it feels rather forced and out of place. Perhaps the problem was mainly due to the overall upbeat nature of the show. It doesn't take itself overly seriously, but when it tries to, it does not do a very good job.\\n\\n\r\nThematically, its main message is about how one goes about doing the thing they love. That is, everyone has their own style of doing things. I felt that the way they handled this was okay at best. I think the biggest problem is that the \"enemy\" in the show is never quite concrete enough in order for there to be any significant push-back. There is impending doom introduced later on in the series but it isn't tangible enough to feel like a threat to the characters and the plot overall.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the animation for the show is very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters move fluidly and in detailed ways. The tanks, likewise, do not actually seem out of place even though they are CG.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also did its best with cinematography, such as when placing the camera beneath the barrel of the tanks or from certain character perspectives.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the animation reminded me a lot of Highschool DxD; the show is generic looking but its animation is nicely done (for whatever reason).\\n\r\nAs for the art style, it was fine. It is nothing good nor bad, just satisfactory. I would have enjoyed more environments for the tank fights than given (less forests and more desert/swamp/mountainous), but the ones they showed were still fine (inner-city, snowy, etc.)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a lot of characters. Because of this, many do not get much screen time at all. And along the same note, that means hardly any of them see actual character development. Because of this, you do not care much for the characters present.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, they are all very cute for who they are. While trope-y, you like the emotionless Reizei, the mother-like Isuzu, and boy-loving Saori, etc. Even the other minor characters, such as the girl who always has one eye shut or the ever studious hall monitor. Having a cast of over 20 or even 30 characters, there is bound to be something for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, they do try to explore at least the main cast. Again, much of this development feels underwhelming and is lumped in with the melodrama that it tries to present. The problem with the show is that it really isn't looking to have complex characters at all. Its main focus is the girls fighting in tank battles. While I am perfectly fine with this, I still wish there would have been some meaningful growth with any of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were too generic for my liking.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the rest of the soundtrack was nicely done. This is mainly because of the ideas at play. That is, with the tanks and WW2 aspects, the pieces of music incorporate drums and trumpets that very much remind you of war. The soundtrack does a nice job of setting the mood, and in that regard I applaud them for it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, I found the roles to be fitting for the characters with no standout performances.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show that you really just watch to have a little bit of fun. The girls themselves are nothing like those from Monogatari or Nisekoi where they are either extremely well developed or incredibly likable. Instead, they are cute girls doing what they do best. And that is participating in a game that involves shooting tank missiles at one another. It can be funny at times and while the tension it stages is never overwhelming, they do a nice job of trying to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to Girls und Panzer, if you are looking for deep characters or a compelling plot, then you are looking at the wrong show. However, if you just want to sit back, relax, and watch girls drive some tanks, then this is the one for you.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, world-builds nicely but not much else\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, fluid character movements and well done tank battles\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, cute girls but nothing more to them\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, OP and ED forgettable but the soundtrack is not\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, cute girls plus tanks is somewhat fun to watch\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "A wonderful and outright perfect work of action-kawaii!\r\nI have watched a fair bit of anime on the theme \"cute girls doing badass things\", and I can easily say that this one does it so right. For a number of different reasons.\r\nFirst, it is knowledgeable in its topic. Other animes (not mentioning names) with a theme of warfare or anything taken directly from the real world sometimes miss the mark. They throw out a bunch of ladies with guns but have no idea how guns work. Their focus is all on the drama and enhancing the narrative, and the theme is only an intermediate. On theother hand, G&P tells you everything you need to know about tanks and tactics. There is no end to the characters discussing features and weaknesses with their vehicles and finding ways to engage \"like during the battle of Stalingrad\". The creators clearly sat for hours in WWII literature.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, it contains no gijinka. You can way what you want about the realism of high school girls driving tanks, but there is no per se unnatural or unhuman about the girls. They are not tanks in themselves. They cannot transform or use magic. They don't talk about the armor rating of their boobs. They are just normal human beings who happen to really like tanks. Without anthropomorphism, the suspension of disbelief is very easy to achieve for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThird, it is without romances and fan service. The creators do not want to show us curves or underwear, they want to show us people. This beautifully compliments the overall badass-y theme of tankery with these schoolgirls doing nothing more than girl power. There is not a single male character that I can remember, and even less so any signs of any of the mains falling in love. This is a very feminist anime that lets its women have their own story and do as they do.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, I will admit that the story is very cheesy. Everything that unfolds is more or less predictable in this kind of story. Not much backstory is told, and most mains are a bit shallow. If you are looking for story excitement or a waifu-worthy personality, look further.\\n\\n\r\nBut in my humble opinion, that is only part of the charm. Because how can you not love seeing a teenage girl yelling \"kawaii\" to a passing squirrel while simultaneously driving a tank towards battle?\\n\r\nThis anime does not try to be a compelling drama, it just aims to be a slice-of-life rhapsody of happiness and cuteness. It is a destination for simple pleasures and relaxing to a comfortable girly and still empowering adventure.\\n\\n\r\nGirls just want to have fun! With tanks!",

And I realized I didn't have that much fun for a looong time.\r\nABOUT STORY (8/10)\r\nThe story is pretty basic, tank driving is amazingly popular among schools and only girls do that, then they compete each other in tournaments etc. But there is so much soul in it and that makes you think yourself asone of the characters from the anime and eventually you enjoy it so much!\\n\r\nABOUT ART (10/10)\\n\r\nThe art style isn't like most of the modern animes so you may find it weird but IMO this style is the best for an anime like this. And about CG's they are really helpful to see the tanks/matches from different angles and that helps you understand better. \\n\r\nABOUT SOUND(10/10)\\n\r\nIt's just amazing lol.\\n\r\nABOUT CHARACTERS(9/10)\\n\r\nCharacters aren't really extra ordinary but the way they put them in the anime like they are actually real is amazing! Even though the anime is focused on tank matches they also show you everyday problems of the girls and that really helps you understand and empathize them.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT(10/10)\\n\r\nIt's been a long time since I was this excited and happy while watching an anime.\\n",

            "content": "Moe is a unique genre that only exist in Japanese entertainment. It has such a different nature, which makes the shows really difficult to evaluate: If we compare the plot with shows such as Death note... 0/10, If we compare action with shows such as Attack on Titans... 0/10. \r\nBut is it fair to ever look at shows like Girls Und Panzer on a critical stand point? I think not. It is not what the creators are trying to achieve, it is not what audiences are looking for either, at least they aren't supposed to. \r\nI guiltily admit Girls and Panzer is actually the oneand ONLY Moe show I have EVER watched in my life time. My judgement on it is purely based the little information and knowledge I obtained from some research I did through Google. Any constructive criticism is welcomed and will be greatly appreciated. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (Concept 4/5, Development 2/5)\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I decided to watch the show is because... TANKS! This is one of the few complete original ideas I've seen in recent years. In this world, girls driving tanks is a competition/art just like how we look at Karate and Swordsmanship. Different schools from different nation compete in bombing others just for the sake of entertainment! How is this not interesting?? \\n\\n\r\nSadly, the way they interpret the show is really... Boring. It is a super basic tournament process where the protagonists beat up various enemy and try to become the champion. Not a single unexpected element. Not even one. \\n\\n\r\nThe story runs like a general, one-after-another competitions with occasional development of friendships within the teams and a little bit of background stories mixed in. I'd say this is the superb boring version of Prince of Tennis. \\n\\n\r\nBut again, this is Moe. This is what the story is supposed to be. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (Design 5/5, Development 2/5)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in GUP is a prime example of quantity over quality. There are at least twenty girls I can identify with at least one line of description. \\n\r\nThis is including but not limited to the following: The try-hard protagonist, the brainless hyperactive, the big nice sister, the quite, smart one and the geek. In addition, stereotypical girls like the Americans, Russians and Germans all have their distinct personalities. \\n\\n\r\nAre the characters cute? yes they are. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the personal development, I acknowledge that each character received at least 5 mins of background story which certainly deserves some credit. None of them are interesting/exciting. The characters did change their attitudes and way of thinking, tho on a very minimal level. Miho for example, starts with doubt with herself, but eventually believes in the power of friendships. Cliche, but at least there is some development. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the characters are... many. And they are all different. That's good enough. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nGRAPHIC (Art 4.5/5, Animation 2.5/5)\\n\\n\r\nI must say I am very impressive by the art. The character design are very generic. But when I look closely I realized none, absolutely none of the 20 major characters has identical eye or hair shape. It only show that the production team actually put some effort into those character designs and that should be appreciated, I think. \\n\\n\r\nThe background... is meh. They look quite good, but really lacks detail and aristic element. too many random colors mixing up to form the landscape and the buildings are sometimes recycled art as well. But since the background barely has any screen time, thanks to the extremely large head those characters have, I'll let it slide for this one. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation in this anime is passable. All the tank scenes are fully render in 3D, but not in great 3D. The special effects are also mediocre. Occasionally the tanks make some seriously impossible/funny moves that make them look like bumper cars in the amusement parks rather than tanks... But it does its job as a Moe anime. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (OP/ED 2.5/3, OST 3/3, Audio??)\\n\\n\r\nNO NOT WATCH DUB. NO. They sound like mid-age moms trying to speak in little girls' voices. The dialogues aren't properly translate either, phrases such as \"I'm glad I was able to make friends.\" are literally everywhere. Just who on Earth says that? \\n\r\nThe Japanese is much more pleasant... \\n\\n\r\nThe Opening is great. They are actually quite memorable and catchy. With the cool little moe tone, it does enlightens my heart a little bit. The ending... Aside from the awfully accented English, is also fine. Perhaps it is just me first time looking at Moe songs so they are pretty memorable.  \\n\\n\r\nThe OST are freaking AWESOME. They have this glorious feeling mixed with happy, light melody. It is very well done, very fitting and memorable. On top of that, they add stereotypical but classic songs such as Katyusha which are really unique and mood boosting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nIt did make me smile a lot, the characters are quite cute. but knowing the ending before the second episodes and the general feeling of wasting time is kinda... boring? \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nI believe. I believe this is a well made anime with everything needed to make a interesting moe series. I would probably not watch it unless I feel absolutely bored and needs some time to kill. It is fun little series and it certainly enlightens my mood. \\n\\n\r\nPeace",

            "content": "Girls und Panzer is an anime from Actas Studio. What's that? You've never heard of Actas? Well, that's not surprising. They mostly do in-between animation and other secondary animation work for larger studios. The only anime I've seen, besides this one, where they were the main force is Tales of Phantasia. One other odd thing to note about this anime is that the series came out at pretty much the same time as the manga rather than one being based on the other. Well, let's take a look at Girls und Panzer and see how that worked out for them.\r\nOur story opens at Oarai girls'school, where they're reviving the ancient sport of tank fighting. Where was that when I was in school? Young Nishizumi Miho is told in no uncertain terms to take it as an elective, the student council isn't that clear on what the word \"elective\" means, since she's the only one in the school with any experience. She initially declines but gets coerced into doing it. As the only experienced person on her team, Miho is quickly elected to the commander's role and she has to win the national competition for reasons that I can't go into without giving spoilers. The problem is that the school's equipment is not the best out there, they're under-manned and most of the team is comprised of newbies. Does the premise sound familiar? Let me rephrase it a bit. \"A group of underdogs have to win the championship title at *insert game here*.\" It's the basic plot of virtually every sports film ever made. To be fair, there are some differences, and not just those based on the fact that the sport in question is fighting with tanks. There's a greater emphasis on tactics, there's no montage and the team isn't made up of a bunch of social misfits who come off as complete losers. So, while the plot is pretty typical in a lot of ways, it does offer something different. This anime also has some really funny aspects, one of the big ones being that one of Oarai's tactics is to send a small and maneuverable but under-powered tank to troll the enemy. It's both really funny and tactically effective. I really only have two problems with the series. The first is that the opening is weak. They start out with the girls first battle and flashback to how they got started, presumably to build intrigue, but it doesn't really work with the tone of the series. Which is an issue with the first episode as a whole. My other issue is just with the length. The story pretty much has to stick with the bare minimum since there are only a dozen episodes. For the time they have, they do do a really good job but they could've used four to seven more episodes to further develop things.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the characters, there's an unruly number in this. Just the Oarai team has thirty-two members by the end and there's not nearly enough time to give most of them even minuscule levels of development. Honestly, it seems like an odd decision. They're clearly not operating under the rules of reality. They could've just said \"in this universe the tanks are modified so that they only need one or two people to operate them\" and kept the number of actual characters much lower. It would be far from the most unrealistic thing in the anime. That being said, I do like the main cast. They're a fun and very entertaining group. I even like Saori, in spite of her annoying me at times. And they do do a pretty good job of giving most of the major re-occurring characters a sense of personality, even if they can't do a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this looks pretty good, overall. The tanks are really well drawn. The action sequences are excellent, especially the last one. There are a lot of nice details in the background. The character art is kind of a typical moe style, but it looks fine. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast in this is pretty good. Particularly Iguchi Yuka, Fuchigami Mai and Nakagami Ikumi. Which is pretty impressive when you consider that two of them have very few roles. I'm pretty sure the Russian that's used at one point is way off, though. I really liked the music in this, especially the triumphant Panzer driving song. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 3/10. There are some scenes that could be read that way, especially the one where Miho tells her tank's crew that she loves them, but there's nothing definitive. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's Girls und Panzer. It's a fun little anime with some good characters and great tank fights. It's not an accurate depiction of panzer warfare by any means, but it is highly entertaining. 8/10.",

            "content": "Anime Review:\u2028 Girls Und Panzer\r\nBy Bobjonez98\r\nStory: 8/10-\r\n\tIn the very distant future, Sensha-do (Way of the Tank) is considered a traditional martial art for young girls, it is a way to build character, relationships, and attitude. Miho Nishizumi, youngest daughter of the famous Nishizumi Tank Driving School, transfers to Oarai Academy to escape the world of Sensha-do. Once she arrives however, she discovers that the program is being revived, and she is pressured by the student council to join. The story follows Miho, and her friends as they scrounge up tanks, hone their skills, and enter the world Sensha-do championship. In the world of \u201cCute GirlsDoing Military Things\u201d, this is the middle child between Strike Witches and Upotte!. Panzers plot is not as complex as Strike Witches, but it doesn\u2019t suffer from shifts in tone that plague it\u2019s older sister. The tone is light, the girls are never in any danger, and it\u2019s treated more like a serious sporting event than an all-out conflict. The majority of the series takes place during the tournament, so the plot, however simple, is kept in focus at all times, unlike Upotte! where it takes a back seat to slice-of-life. Overall, the story is focused, but not overwhelmingly so, the plot is simple, but has 1 or 2 curves in it to keep things interesting, and most importantly, it actually drives the series. Good Work.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10-\\n\r\n\tWhile this series, like its sisters, has a multitude of characters, it keeps the family tradition of having all of them characterized. Oarai fields 8 tanks by the end of the series, each one operated by a social club or group within the school. The Volleyball Team, Auto Club, Hall Monitors, Student Council, and History Club each have their own tank, as well as a group of 6 young freshman, 3 girls who met online playing World of Tanks, and Mihos group. With so many characters, you would be forgiven for maybe mixing a few of them up on screen, but this WILL NOT HAPPEN. Each girl is given her own personality, quirks, voice, and way of acting both within and outside of the group. The main group consists of Miho, the meek and quiet leader of the group, Mako, the anemic driver who believes that \u201cMornings should not exist\u201d, Saori, who just wants to find herself a handsome husband, Yukari, the tomboyish tank otaku, and Hana, the quiet child of a famous florist. Add in characters like Erwin, the WWII buff who commands the StuG, Katyusha, leader of the Russian team with a serious Napoleon complex, and Anzu, the childish Student Council president, and you have a real recipe for fun on your hands. However, with the series being so short, and having so many characters, screen time is going to be limited, and you find yourself wishing that your favorite character had more exposition.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 9/10-\\n\r\n\tOk, ok. I know 9 is a little high, especially when some consider the art style to be a little dated. But my god, do those tanks look beautiful. Accurate moving parts, tread movements, barrel lengths. All the tank designs are beautifully accurate and realistic. Every single battle scene boasts high production values, fluid motions, accurate recoil, realistic speeds and maneuvers. The battles are just top notch. Whoever did the 3D tank renderings on this show did an amazing job, serious kudos to them.\\n\\n\r\nOp/Ed: 7/10|7/10-\\n\r\n\tNothing really special here, they\u2019re a little better than average, they\u2019re catchy, but nothing that will get stuck in your head for hours at a time. They\u2019re both upbeat and airy, they work well with each other, and the animations during them are fluid and fit the music.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10-\\n\r\n\tBattle Hymn of the Republic, Katyusha, British Grenadiers, Erika, Panzerlied, these are just some of the musical jems we are treated to during the course of the show. Add in a handful of marches and melodies furnished by the studio, and you have the perfect soundtrack for watching a few dozen tanks face off while cute girls are at the controls.\\n\\n\r\nOverall for WWII Buffs and Tank Lovers: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall for Everyone Else: 7/10-\\n\r\n\tWhile it may be a cop-out to score this series this way, it\u2019s very true. It was recently pointed out to me by a non-\u201cWWII Buff/Tank Lover\u201d that they enjoyed this series less than Upotte! because in Upotte! the girls were personifications of the guns themselves, making for a learning experience. By getting to know the girls, you learned the quirks of the guns, their unique traits, their roles. This is absent in Panzer. All the tank info given is spoken in dialogue by the characters, and the Tanks don\u2019t particularly match the personality group that operates them (Notable exceptions; the History Club and their StuG, The Auto Club and their Tiger(P)). Basically, if you\u2019ve come in knowing nothing about tanks, this is an enjoyable ride that has some thrills, great characters, and truly funny and unique moments. However, if you can tell your T34s from your Panthers, you\u2019re going to absolutely adore this series.\\n",

            "content": "(updated 9/19/18 for format and slight content revision)\r\nHi! Welcome to another of Robert's Too Late Reviews! As always the synopsis is your friend, possible minor SPOILERS, but I do my best to keep them at a minimum, and finally I'm working off the dubbed version, will rewatch subbed and edit if needed. I came into this anime because I have great interest in things relating to World War II. Figured it might have some cool tanks coupled with the boring 'cute girls doing strange things' trope. As always we will determine if the gals in the tanks warrant inclusion on the famed RTLR wall ofweirdness. I was completely surprised, finding that this show is actually quite a lot of fun!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8 \\n\r\nThere's a lot to do with overcoming the expectations of authority figures like parents and the like, but the story kind of drops the ball on this point, the main character's act of defiance is a bit weak in the end. This being an ensemble cast, however, there are several intermingling aspects to the plot. There's a group that was nothing more than to bring back volleyball so they join the tank team. Not sure how that was supposed to work, but whatever. Then there's the history club that are obviously there to ride in WWII tanks and such. By the end we have 8 tank teams so we're talking a lot of characters, from freshmen to hall monitors, to hardcore gamers. It can be distracting, but they do tend to focus on the main character's tank crew of 5, and the tank team made of the 3 student council leaders, keeping the focus better than one might expect. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a subplot that I won't ruin, but if you've seen many movies, anime, or tv shows you know as soon as the hint is dropped what is going down. Its one of the most overused motivation plots around, that pulls the story back some. This point is countered well by the story around the main character's motivations.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe tanks all look fantastic! If you're interested in history or have spend much time in WWII video games, you should immediately recognize nearly all the tanks used. They don't depict their abilities at perfectly historic levels, but generally they follow how useful most of the tanks were. For example, the Tiger is tough, but the weaknesses of some of the other models aren't really pointed out. Of course it's just an anime, not a tank documentary so it's just fine to go with general parameters. The battles are impressive looking, the characters themselves are detailed and expressive, so overall it looks really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThis is the anime to watch if you have a nice sound system. I have a big set of 5.1's and I cranked them during some of the episodes, and the battles sometimes made my teeth rattle in my head. I imagine my neighbors were very appreciative of me letting them hear the show as well! At least the police didn't show up. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nI really came to love the girls in this anime. My favorite was the main tank crew's driver, a girl who cannot for the life of her wake up in the morning, and has the enthusiasm of a rather bored rock. She might sound dull, but she serves as a perfect foil for the bubbly redhead who gets excited over everything, and is completely boy crazy. There is also a 'tank nerd' on the crew who is a little embarrassed to be so into tanks. The main character has her plot driving family drama but is sweet and determined, and we round out the group with a girl who comes from a family of flower arrangers and has the classic 'nice girl' view on things, very peaceful and serene. \\n\\n\r\nThe extended cast is well done. The student council vice president is the severe, strict type, while the president herself seems carefree but is actually working hard for the tank club and shouldering a heavy load. The hall monitors, when they join later in the season, are just as overzealous about performing well as they are being hall monitors. The other schools they battle also are full of memorable characters with distinct styles. While its a little like Game of Thrones with all the characters, you might not remember names, but they have enough personality to keep them from being cookie cutters of each other. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis was a really fun anime, and the aspects might not seem like they would be complimentary, but in the end, all of it together works better than one might think. I found myself laughing at times, and feeling the drama when the girls were outnumbered and outgunned. The only real distractions for me were some of the unrealistic tank maneuvers that pop up here and there. The movie was FAR worse in that respect than the series. For the most part, actual tactics mattered more than 'super' moves. I honestly only wanted to watch to evaluate how they treated the WWII tanks, and found myself just enjoying every moment of the show.  Girls und Panzer scored two spots on the Great RTLR wall, (Mako ftw!) and was so much fun it is in consideration for another one! The take driver Mako even scored a figurine of the silly shelves of wackiness! Unless you just hate 'cute girls doing weird things' I bet you can a good bit to like about this anime as well!",

            "content": "Girls Und Panzer Review \r\nThere are no spoilers in this review \r\nGirls und panzer is one of those anime's like Initial D or Broken Blade which are highly appealing to my interests. When I first herd about it I heard it compared to K-On! What I am glad about that it ended up not being like K-on! at all. It was it's own show in its own right and I liked it allot. \r\nStory \r\nWhen it comes down to story you are probably going to find Girls und Panzer a bit predictive. But frankly what made this show great in my eyes wasn't the story.It was the action and it was the preparation for the action which peaked my interests the most. \\n\r\nDon't get me wrong I enjoyed the story allot as well, but it was predictive. \\n\r\nThe strong points about the story where the details and not the big picture. The small details where the social interaction, the talk about tanks and the action whilst the overall view was the plot of the story. \\n\\n\r\nI came to this show for the tanks and cute girls and it certainly delivered. The small amounts of technical talk and tacit/strategy talk was an added bonus which added to my enjoyment of the show. \\n\\n\r\nI remember at certain points thinking to myself, you should move your tanks in this way if you want to win and I was glad to see sometimes that's what happened. It made me feel competent in my own knowledge base but it was equally as exciting to see them [Miho and her team] do something unpredictable and pull off great feats. \\n\\n\r\nMy admiration of all these things may be a bit childish I admit but I feel no guilt or shame enjoying this and I certainly won't take back anything I have said. Basically I enjoyed the story greatly and I think this will be one of those anime's which I will re-watch allot and stay in my top 5 favourites. \\n\\n\r\nTech \\n\r\nI'd like to keep this section short, but I don't think it will pan out that way. Anyway, the technical side of things. I overall found the animation, art, sound, effects and CGI to be of high quality generally speaking. But it's not perfect. \\n\\n\r\nI found again being annoyed by the under detailed faces and profile shots which seem to be allot more common in more modern anime. It's not a trend I enjoy and I appreciate a bit more detail, which is one of the reasons I like the 90's art styles the most. It sure is a little thing to pick at but its one of those thing which some of us don't like. \\n\\n\r\nBut other than that I was impressed with the art of the show. The CGI was of quality and suited the show well. I'd even go to say the CGI and 2D animation blending was almost flawless. The visual special effects I think could have been been better I think. Besides the noses I think it's the lowest factor about the art of the show. Which at this point is probably just knick picking. \\n\\n\r\nThe audio and sound selection was much to my liking. No complaints about them from me. The Opening www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDfETl1WrX8 and Endings www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ369DarcIY had great music to them and the OST was highly enjoyable for me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nCharacterization in this show was good in my opinion. Their are allot of characters in this show and I think allot of them developed well. It was enjoyable seeing friendships being formed on the field and off the field, and it's always good seeing members of different teams getting along and being good sportsmen. \\n\\n\r\nIt's one of those anime's where I don't think there is a single despicable character in it. There are some which are unpleasant at times but it seems to be a very sort of lovey dovey kind of world. I know this alone would be enough for some people to not enjoy it as much but for me it made the show all that more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\r\nI just have to say this is the longest review I have written for a single show and that alone is an achievement in my books. I just had so much more to say about why I liked this show than anything else I watched. That being said it's a show with flaws. It isn't perfect and they are the most obvious in the story. But if you can get past that I think you will enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you have a thing for tanks this is the show for you. Their is allot more tank action then there is to be expected. The last battle went for around 30-40 minutes and was divided up between 3 episodes. The action is not lacking and it's refined. This is a great light-hearted show about determination and fighting spirit in a sportsman like fashion. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of the show and the relevance to my interest did bump up my score for the show. \\n\\n\r\nScore 9/10",

            "content": "Pretty girls, tanks, and big boom, what more can you ask for? Girls und Panzer breaks away from your typical schoolgirls with guns plus fanservice into schoolgirls with tanks minus the fanservice. And they did not fail to deliver!\r\nTankery is the name of the sport, but for these girls its a way of life. Tankery help these girls to become strong, graceful, and indepent woman. But like every sport there's always those tough challenges to face, and one of those is dealing with a strong opponent and being the underdog who strives to win it all and show the world that they too can playwith the big kids, and this is no exception for Miho Nishizumi. Ok lets begin the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nIt's a simple story not very complex so its easy to follow and understand. The story does deliver, like I said it's the same old sports story, where you're the underdog and surprise everyone by beating the top players, however there is a twist. The underdog school Oarai High School is facing closure and the student council is desperate to save their school, so they decide to re-establish the old club of tankery and force Miho (who was a tankerer at her old school and is the daughter and sister of the most popular tankerers) to join the tankery club, and then this set off the chain event to come, from Miho becoming the commander for her team, to surprising everyone with her tactical skills and beating other teams that were more skillful and stronger, to (well not going to spoil it for now this is a review not a summary).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nMostly for how much effort they put into detailing the tanks, and how they kept the animation consistent even in fast paced action, not like other anime that for some reason degrades the art style in an epic battle *cough* Naruto tail cloak vs pain *cough* but anyways Girls und panzer did great with consistency and that's a A+ in my book.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nNot every time you hear old classical WW2 music during an anime, and it fit well! Most of the tanks were old school ww2 tanks anyways so you can see why its appropiate, it had its intensity when it needed to and its mellow tone when things slimmer down, and the opening gets you into the start very catchy and might stick in your head for awhile.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nToo many characters but it makes sense when you figure how many crew members per tanks and the number of tanks there were. But the characters were a bit bland at some point especially the volleyball team and the newest team who played a mmo tank game and was the first to be taken out, those 2 weren't very memorable, as for developement they kept it focus more on the main gals of the story which is a good thing since we're more focus on them. The team of anglerfish was great and they worked so well for a group of people that were so completely different in everyway yet were pieces that connected very well, and helped Niho the main chika become more of a leader and dependable character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 8\\n\r\nThe intense moment will have you glued to the screen routing for Oarai high to come out on top. This anime its very enjoyable they do have there humor moments but this anime is more of a willpower to fight on type. And you will feel that way too(I do not reccommend you to get on a tank and pull of those stunts you might be amd could killed) but anyways the battle were great, you learn alot believe it or not, and you would grow to like the characters and route for them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.6\\n\r\nNot much to say really its very enjoyable and fun to watch its something different but you'll like it. You might want to play world of tanks after because of this though. But anyways give it a shot its worth it could've been a bit longer atleast 24-26 episodes but hey can't complain.",

            "content": "As you may notice I tend to stop watching anime all the time. Sudden bursts of activity are followed by stagnant periods of inactivity. This is pretty much due to the fact the majority of anime I watch is so average or subpar, I get sick and tired of it. Despite all these anime having different plots and characters, they still manage to have the same plot and the same characters. And after seeing enough anime that contains two dimensional everything, I kind of move on to watching movies and finding more engaging media until a niggling voice in my head tells me to comeback and embrace the garbage once again.\\n\\n\r\nGirls Und Panzer reminds me why I intermittently stop watching anime. It\u2019s the kind of arbitrary fap bait that has permeated nearly every season of anime for the past\u2026well, as long as I\u2019ve been watching anime. It\u2019s a show with a following because it appeals to a demographic of people while also appealing to their weiners. Obviously if you like tanks or World War II or military stuff, you\u2019ve most likely seen Girls Und Panzer. Whether you\u2019re into these things or not, you\u2019re embarking on a subpar journey with very few positive merits.\\n\\n\r\nThe show takes place at Oarai Girls Academy, where Miho Nishizumi is attempting to escape her previous life as a member of a tankery team. She meets new friends and, because the plot demands it, winds up getting stuck in a tankery after school activity. Her friends join her and together they, along with a lot of other students, set out to win a tankery tournament and save their school.\\n\\n\r\nSo we have a real basic setup here. The tank thing is an after-school event and the show focuses on the tournament between the different schools. It\u2019s basically a sports anime in that regard. Once the initial hurdle of getting to the tournament is passed, the series moves at a fast clip, sending us from battle to battle. It\u2019s paced pretty well but there\u2019s a point about halfway through where they skip an entire battle for absolutely no reason. Every other fight of the tournament between our heroes and the other teams is shown, but this one is skipped. Okay, they wanted to push the anime forward and fit everything into the allotted episode limit. But it kind of ruins the whole idea of the underdog coming out on top. It\u2019s a boring and overused plot device but part of the drama of this device is seeing how these underdogs manage to win. Especially after the upset of the first match, where we\u2019re led to believe the Oarai team  won due to some divine miracle, it breaks up the drama. Great, the underdogs are really badasses. Okay, so we can expect that they\u2019ll win all their other matches.\\n\\n\r\nBut that only scratches the surface of the problems. The first major problem comes from the idea of tankery being feminine. The series establishes that tanks are feminine and tankery makes you a better wife. This raises a lot of questions in my head. Who, other than a Japanese man with strange fetishes, finds tanks to be feminine? When I think of femininity I don\u2019t think of giant hunks of metal with massive cannons on them. So this idea of tanks being the kind of thing girls would love is ridiculously stupid. I\u2019ve never known a girl who can tell an AK-47 from an M-16, let alone one who thinks tanks are cool.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the anime takes place on a converted aircraft carrier. As in, the top of the carrier has been terraformed. Okay, the image is cool and if this were an anime like Gargantia where the planet is covered in water, I\u2019d buy it. But the explanation of why schools are on battleships has something to do with how bad the school system is. Basically, the question is glossed over because not even the writer can figure out why the hell the schools are on ships.\\n\\n\r\nAnd all the schools in the show are all-girl schools! Where are the men? What do men do in this world?\\n\\n\r\nWhy is it that people see a tank driving through their neighborhood and shooting and go from shocked to \u201cGOOD LUCK AT THE MATCH!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhy did a guy forget about the fact a tank was run into his shopfront because it is \u201cgood luck\u201d?\\n\\n\r\nHow come they use old tanks? How come these tanks move so fast? How come the tank uniforms consist of short skirts? How come tanks are relevant to combat in a series that takes place in modern times?\\n\\n\r\nAnd how come they didn\u2019t mention that the school would close if they didn\u2019t win the tournament until near the end? That\u2019s a pretty big thing to forget about until the plot demands a reason for the characters to band together and set aside everything to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nThis show opens up so many questions. It has the skeletal parts of a story, but none of the meat that makes a story, you know, understandable. It\u2019s like a guy was sitting at his desk with a model tank, a tank guidebook, and was watching Lucky Star. He had a voila moment and wrote out an anime that shows he obviously likes tanks and moe but he doesn\u2019t understand anything about storytelling, character development, or world building.\\n\\n\r\nOh but the characters! How can I hate such fantastic characters? Every character in this show is pretty much awful with the exception of Yukari, who managed to be silly and cute at the same time. There\u2019s Mako who falls asleep a lot. And Hana who\u2026arranges flowers and that\u2019s about it. Saori\u2026she needs to get laid. Miho, the main character. She\u2019s about as boring as you\u2019d expect. One bad thing in her past defines her otherwise unstoppable winning streak. Like Kirito, she can pull shit from the air. She drifts a tank. She seriously drifts a fucking tank. Like, I could forgive most of the stupid physics and liberties taken with the tanks since it\u2019s a cartoon. But drifting a tank\u2026okay you\u2019ve lost me.\\n\\n\r\nCompound all these inherent problems with a lackluster main theme and ending (at least during the show the military music is a nice touch) as well as some mediocre animation (along with terrible CG tanks) and you have yourself a show so underwhelming and stupid, you\u2019ll wonder why you sat through all twelve episodes.",

            "content": "Well basically when I was just getting in to anime I saw a youtuber that liked this show's song 'Katyusha\" I was interested with the title so I watched it . After the watching song my initial reaction was \"wth?\" but even though it was showing young girls driving tanks while singing a russian song I was very interested with the universe so I looked the show up on the internet. And *Bam* I found the show Girls Und Panzer. At first I thought its a generic slice of life moe anime but man I was wrong!\r\nWhile I was watching the show I noticed thatit had a World War 2-ish vibe to it but with an interesting modern touch to it. With this it had a really good opportunity for the writers to expand the lore of this unique world. Sadly this never really happens while I was watching the anime and it left a lot plot holes in the setting. Along with the setting the story is unique in concept due to the fact is \"Cute Girls riding Massive World War 2 Tanks\" but its pretty much mediocre overall\\n\\n\r\nNow you must be wondering why I gave the show an 8? Well there are many reasons to like or even love Girls Und Panzer. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters at first I thought the were carbon copies of the already stereotypical slice of life personalities, which is true but the longer I watched the show the more I started to care about the characters and I felt they grew closer to me. I was actually surprised at first because they had many generic characteristics of their specific stereotype. But then I realised why I liked them very much is their undeniable charm and humour that was embedded in them.\\n\\n\r\nWith charming characters would come with great animation right? Well the animation quality of the characters is a typical anime standard. But when the tank battle scenes roll in its phenomenal to watch. The animation for the tanks is jerkish but this gives them a realistic feel to them while the girls drive their tanks. Plus it builds up the show's suspense when the tanks move slowly while an opponent's tank shell is heading towards them!\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the superb animation comes with great immersible sounds. With the characters usually driving tanks most of the time they would need a very good sound designer due to the fact that tanks are loud and noisy! Well I give kudos to them because they really executed the sound effects for the tanks very well, like the engine's sound while the tank is moving to the tank shells fired at their opponents. It gave me[hopefully you] an immersible experience even though I/you didn't ride in a tank before. Also the background track really gave a nostalgic and immersible feel like the characters were fighting in the World War 2 era but with some charming cuteness left in the heat of the battle.\\n\\n\r\nWith a combination of animation, story, characters and sound Girls Und Panzer is a very enjoyable anime that shouldn't be missed out by any World War 2 fanactic or by anyone. So in a nutshell go and watch this anime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n",

            "content": "I am terribly late to this. Which is unfair, because I finished this long ago.\r\nGirls und Panzer, at best, first appears as if it were your standard run-of-the-mill 'moe' sort of anime. And the theme does sort of continue, and then you're hit in the face by the occurrence of an outrageously accurate depiction of a tank. \r\nWhich brings me to the main focus of this review. I watched Girls und Panzer not for the story, but for the tanks. It's not called Girls und PANZER for nothing. \r\nStandard anime review rules applied, the story, characters and overall enjoyment range from 6 to 7. I'llelaborate on these below. Art and sound score a very respectable 9. \\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't particularly engaging. For spoiler reasons, no details will be given. However, it is a relatively predictable story outside of the tank battles, with a transfer-student from a top school at tankery to one that hasn't had a program in years, and so forth. Excluding the tank battles, this would be a 6 at best. However, the story also includes tank battles. I will freely admit that some of the latter tank battles (no names) did indeed give me a sense of suspense and anticipation, but there was a constant lingering gut feeling that I knew Ooarai would win. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that Ooarai was going to win, every time, and although there are some notable exceptions where the way through which they won was incredibly tense, the fact that I knew they would win places the story at a mid-range 7. \\n\\n\r\nMost characters were a bit uninspiring, with the exception of Yukari (bless this tank nerd). There was the traditional superiority complex present, the discrepancy in family heritage and techniques, the breaking of honour for friendship and so forth, present through many character interactions. Some character interactions did indeed fill me with a sense of humour and light-hearted joy (Nonna and Katyusha being a wonderful example). But the characters are rather predictable most of the time, and so character-wise Girls und Panzer scores a mediocre 6. Not terrible, and some tropes aren't horribly overdone while others are simply blown up (no tank puns) to incredible levels, but not exceptionally special. \\n\\n\r\nEnough of being a depressing person. It's time to move on to the fun stuff.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound have to be reviewed together. Here is the true glory of Girls und Panzer, and why Actas has done such a fantastic job of making Girls und Panzer special. As can be interpreted from the title, tanks play an important role in the show, and the art and sound certainly do not disappoint. Few things give a history buff like myself a euphoric buzz like a tank moving and hearing the pure mechanical noises that come with it. Girls und Panzer got my heart racing the moment I saw the first tank, and as the list of tanks rolled on, not only did I like the show more and more for including rarer and more invaluable, museum-worthy tanks that have no right being on a modern battlefield or rammed into each other, but I also stopped being able to refrain from squealing at each shell bounce, each mechanical grinding sound, each metallic clank and each hydraulic whirr. Art does not let me down at this point either. Tank suspension mechanics, turret traverse, gun elevation and locking, internal tank view modeling and the natural flow of the tracks simply added to the excitement I felt while watching each tank battle, and at this point I will concede that I had to rewatch certain parts of the episodes simply because I couldn't wait to skip to the tank battles. They are that enjoyable, and the only issue I could possibly find would be the sounds of the guns and the explosions - sometimes, they sound too high-end and lack a certain low-end focus that would be more expected of a tank's gun or an explosion; that is, the sound sometimes feels too crisp and nasal. Another nitpick would be the lighting - sometimes light doesn't reflect off of certain parts of the tanks, as if they were all painted in matte paint, which does subtract slightly from the pure realism. But these are small issues amongst a magnificent depiction of a juicily wide selection of World War II armoured fighting vehicles. Solid 9s for both the art and the sounds.\\n\\n\r\nPutting aside my history buff self for a moment, enjoyment. It would be a 8 or even a 9 if I were to analyse it from my historical enjoyment perspective, but as I wish to be as honest in these reviews that I post, as well as recognising that not many people have the same level of fanaticism about armour or wartime technology as myself, I'll try to analyse enjoyment based on a more neutral perspective, and for this reason enjoyment sits at a solid 7. The excitement of the tank realism and the battles themselves is mitigated by the fact that the outcomes are predictable (though the course of the battles usually aren't) and that the parts of the show where tanks aren't featured is either quite normal, in a sense, or uninspiring. It does sometimes give you the desire to skip a few seconds just to get closer to the tank battles and avoid the dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, what do I think? A solid 8 is in order. The problems with a relatively basic storyline, predictable outcomes and uninspiring characters and character dialogue is completely, if not increasingly, balanced out by the sheer delicacy of the sound and art used to depict the tanks as well as some of the architecture and scenery. Although there are some problems with the depictions of the tanks, and there are admittedly some quite humorous sides of character relationships and characters themselves, the good points more than balance out the bad points. This show is definitely worth your time, and for a more immersive and balanced understanding of the backstory of this show's universe, also remember to watch the Girls und Panzer OVA movie, which includes a battle that was omitted from the original anime for reasons. \\n\\n\r\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm heading back to World of Tanks.",

            "content": "My faith in anime has been restored.\r\nThe anime industry is infamously known for doing two things: using extremely cliche story and character molds and pulling off the craziest and most gimmicky ideas that often fail because of bad execution. We as viewers often bemoan these two sins and postulate the dire future of anime. So if I said that this recent anime employed BOTH stock plot and characters as well as a ludicrous setting and theme, you would hardly believe me if I also added that the anime was amazingly well-done and great overall. Instead, you would probably dismiss me as some tasteless, uncultured blightto anime society as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nI now kindly ask you to please set aside your prejudices as I introduce you to Girls und Panzer.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer is quite possibly the strangest anime of the 2012-2013 season. It relies on a unique setting, a large cast of characters, and a 1:1 girls to explosions ratio to deliver a one-of-a-kind anime experience. While the anime is built on the classic and cliche nationals tournament plot template, Girls und Panzer correctly implements the story in a way that makes the competitions seem realistic despite the absurdity of the entire idea. While the anime doesn't stand out extraordinarily in any one aspect, the show in its entirety is such a complete package, delivering everything and lacking in none.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all, Girls und Panzer demonstrates that good execution can rectify the cliche story, bring to life the stock characters, and polish the wild and fantastic ideas that makes Japanese anime a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10)\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Girls und Panzer follows the Japanese nationals tournament plot template. Used by other anime such as Saki and Angelic Layer, the Japanese nationals plot template has many key distinguishable features that make the story unbelievably predictable. Let me list them off:\\n\\n\r\n1. The protagonist of the story must be relatively inexperienced but have lots of talent or a hidden ability\\n\r\n2. The protagonist must be dragged into the competitive sport scene either unwittingly or against their own will\\n\r\n3. The reigning champion and/or final opponent of the said sport must have once had close relationships with the protagonist, but broke away because of various issues\\n\r\n4. The protagonist will assemble a ragtag team that, despite having potential, will always be seen as the underdogs (If it is a solo sport, then the protagonist will be the dark horse candidate)\\n\r\n5. The protagonist will win their first major match by luck or a handicap from the opposing side\\n\r\n6. The semifinals is always the hardest and most realistic match\\n\r\n7. The protagonist will meet his fated opponent in the finals and win through a comeback\\n\r\n8. The protagonist and fated rival will improve relationships ever so slightly, but if the anime has potential for a second season, no major gains will have been made\\n\r\n9. Despite being national champions, life returns to normal within a week\\n\\n\r\nThe only exception to this rule is Pokemon, but that's because the anime will never end.\\n\\n\r\nUsing the template like that with practically no changes would normally earn an anime a 4, but Girls und Panzer redeems itself partially with some impressive fight scenes. The strategies employed are not outrageous or unrealistic but model some actual WWI and WWII tactics. Ooarai high school wins not because of some stupendous miracle, but because they persevered, were slightly lucky, and pressed every advantage they had. I was genuinely impressed at the fight scenes. I think if the anime had 24 episodes to work with, they could have added content that bypassed the template limitations. For a 12 episode anime, they did a fantastic job.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer's art is quite nice. The tanks are drawn with incredible detail, and the battlefield settings really come alive. The style of drawing the academy ships entering the port city was quite nostalgic of Miyasaki's style with his various movies like Howl's and Ponyo. Some of the character designs were also full of life and vibrancy.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer astounded me with their OST. I'll begin by referring to a blog article written by Aftershok about the OST (http://blog.animeinstrumentality.net/2013/01/girls-und-panzer-original-soundtrack-review/). Not only is the OP another great song by Choucho, but the soundtrack itself is superb and amazing. I was blown away when I first heard the beat of the drums and the violins and trumpets playing...American marches? Not only that, but they actually included the US Army Anthem \"The Army Goes Rolling Around\". Incredible. The other highlight is \"Katyusha\", a Russian wartime song that is sung by the seiyuus of Pravda High. While the marches added a comedic feel to the tanks rolling across the battlefield, it allowed me tap into the lighthearted feel of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOf course. Girls and tanks. Lighthearted anime.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of girls, this anime uses literal armies of them through the course of the anime. By the end, the Ooarai high school Panzer force consisted of 5+4+4+3+6+3+4+3 = 32. That's a lot of girls. Eventually, they couldn't make each of them unique enough, so they had to step back and make duplicates. The Goose/Mallard team, for example, consists of three indentical-looking members of the Public Morals Committee, while all the girls in the Rabbit team were essentially copies of each other with different hairstyles and voices. Even after cutting all these corners, however, the cast remains unique and interesting. I personally love the Hippo team with their military getups and eccentricities.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer is an obvious satire and parody of war, especially of WWII. This becomes extremely apparent with the introduction of the other schools. St. Gloriana represents Britain, Saunders America, Anzio (an Italian coast city) Italy, Pravda (a Russian communist newspaper) Soviet Russia, and Kuromorimine (Black Forest Peak) Germany. Ooarai represents Japan, which is super ironic considering the current state of the Japanese Self-Defense Force (given their constitution and eternal pledge to America, they're probably still using WWII tanks). Each high school demonstrates the cultural and even military tendencies of their respective countries: American is about mass numbers (but we still fight fairly!) while Russia uses a hit and retreat \"scorched earth policy\" on the taiga. The characters were well made, well designed, and very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really made the characters a hit was the lack of blatant fanservice. Instead of flaunting overly sexual themes, Girls und Panzer strives to retain the delicateness and cuteness of girls. Compared to American media and the mecha anime of old which featured busty girls with much more sex appeal, this new approach feels fresh and clean. Instead of being forced to stare at their physical endowments, the audience is allowed to appreciate the girls's personalities and characters.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer showed me that an anime has a lot more to give than the 300 x 427 picture and short synopsis on MAL. It proved to me that good anime can exist despite having an exceptionally obvious plot, just like how beautiful flowers can grow in the midst of weeds. I was thoroughly shocked and delighted by this anime, by this rare diamond in the rough.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nPanzer vor!",

            "content": "There was a time in the modern society when the online communist weeaboos (or gamers, the more dignified version) were a commonly sentient thing a while back in the internet, primarily on the popular social media that is Facebook. Either \"Soyuz Nerushimy\" a.k.a. \"USSR Anthem\" or \"Katyusha\" that became the integral anthems that most of the newbies of the online communist weeaboos/gamers must know the first verse of those anthems to be proudly self-declare as a leftist despite only having detailed knowledge on history of The Cold War and World War II, where the Motherland Soviet Russia took part on those occurrences and most likelyrun away from discussing topics that not including the former superpower country because history are just mere collected past records from the witnessing ordinary people with the absence of the Great Russia, therefore that isn't cool. I was a part of that phenomenon and i kinda miss those stupid yet fun times despite that dubbed failure ideology is currently assertively banned in my beloved home country and the intergenerational hearsay that the civil apparatus would knock down your front door and confine you to for mindlessly adhering that killer ideology. When the communist killers went to actions of felony that caused PTSD for the whole country until this day, i wasn't even a being at that time and honestly as an ignorant but peace seeking person with somewhat apathetic mindset on history would prefer to read a good book than discussing about disputed facts. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone around the globe can be a memetic online communist with knowing \"Soyuz Nerushimy\" \"Katyusha\", T-34, Kalashnikov, Papa Stalin, Carol Marcus, Vlad, Trotskij, but while communism is a considered badass and manly idealism there is also a fireball's chance in hell that that online communist would like moe. What should satisfy those people on the internet? Japan has the definite answer for that desire fulfillment that is Girls & Panzer, the ultimate online communist weeb anime!\\n\\n\r\nGirls & Panzer is about a five girls doing a shoot and scoot game \"Senshadou\" a fictional sport resembling tank skirmish that would be a blast if this were a real life game. For a dumb reason the girls must play the tanks and win a competition to defend their school to prevent defunct from the evil adults. For a moe show the ending of this show would be usually happy but in the recent times there is also a lot of spawnings of scary moe anime. I put this show in the middle of the line between honest moe and wolf in sheep's clothing kind of moe because the fear of losing your school to the villains is quite horrifying to consider.\\n\\n\r\nThe landscape battlefield is nicely done in this series. The mechanism of tanks ridden by the cute girls can be ridiculous at some times but smoothly done, and the firing sound can be really loud expected from a long-barreled bullet launcher battle series. Some of the songs played in this series are coming from the second world war times, both instrumentally and vocally. One of those songs is the popular Soviet folk song \"Katyusha\" that i mention a lot in the beginning of this review being sung by an opposing characters that resembles the USSR Army in this anime series. The main cast of characters is what you expect from those moe anime characters in your mind. What makes this show a bit different is the tank battles that is a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI usually enjoy good cute girls doing cute things and honestly this one is not even disappointing if you simply expect tank battles with moe and can be fully enjoyable if you are not really being overly critical, and i would really like to recommend this anime series if you are a fan of both cute girls doing cute things and second world war land artillery. This anime was a huge hit within the community of tank warfare online games players, new millenium born communist poseurs that never touched a grown up book before, common weeaboos with loli body pillows, and casual watchers. I can say that this anime is a fun experience as a casual anime fan that is good enough in my opinion and don't hesitate to start watching this putting aside the feeling of seriousness, no one ever said before that Girls & Panzer is family unfriendly in any way.

            "content": "Girls und Panzer, which literally translates to \"Girls and Armor,\" or more directly, \"Girls and Tanks,\" is an odd show. It's 100% what the title says it is, and yet it's nothing like you might expect.\r\nYou might think a show about cute girls engaging in tank battles would be fanservice and ecchi-laden. Girls und Panzer delivers a single girl washing a tank in a bikini and a brief scene where a girl's bust is measured (over clothes) for her Tankery uniform. As cute as the cast can be, it's the tanks themselves the show wants you to ogle. \r\nYou might think the series would bepresented as a joke, or (at the other extreme) become very dark, but Girls und Panzer plays its material straight. The girls' Tankery battles are treated with all the seriousness that accompanies more traditional \"sports\" anime. While it requires some suspension of disbelief to accept that tank battles with live rounds don't incur mass casualties, such is the world of Girls und Panzer. \\n\\n\r\nDespite - yet simultaneously because of - these choices, Girls und Panzer is successful at turning its ridiculous premise into an enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer does a nice job in its presentation, as well. The series is brightly colored and well-animated. While the \"tank porn\" steals the show, the character movements and expressions look fluid and natural. The music draws on military hymns and adds to the experience, despite being a bit repetitive. The sound effects are great, and I found no issues with the (Japanese) voice work.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pick Girls und Panzer's biggest flaw, it's that the large cast and 12-episode run do not allow for much character development between the centerpiece battles of nearly every installment. A few major characters are given a bit of backstory or insight into their lives outside of Tankery, but it's clear that isn't the focus.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, Girls und Panzer is a solid, if unconventional title that unexpectedly owes more to the \"sports\" anime genre than to any other. And a highly entertaining one, at that. It's a series I'd recommend to viewers of all ages who enjoy cute (but not sexualized) girls, strategic battles, and of course, tanks.\\n",

            "content": "I started watching Girls und Panzer expecting a fluffy harem of girls, piloting tanks, and singing songs. Generally, I expected something enjoyable but without much substance. What I received instead defied all of my expectations. Girls und Panzer provided excellent character development, thrilling battle scenes, and an enjoyable overall plot, without compromising it's goal to provide an anime for tank lovers. \r\n(Animation and Sound) \r\nGirls und Panzer is one of the only anime of it's kind, and it deserves credit for bravely blazing a new trail, and doing it well. I found myself desperately craving the conclusion to many of the tank fights, and atno point was it easy to guess what was going to happen next. The tanks themselves are beautifully designed, and the sounds emitted by these tanks are a joy to listen to. Every shot, explosion, or tank movement is auditory excellence.\\n\\n\r\nThe tanks themselves are designed accurately and animated superbly. It is evident that this show was meant to be a show about tanks, and that was where the budget was spent. I was not a tank fan entering the show, but after watching GuP I found myself enjoying the concept of tanks more than ever before, even going as far as to download World of Tanks. \\n\\n\r\n(Plot and Character Development) \\n\\n\r\nThough not all of the characters receive individual development over the course of the show, it is the development of their team of tank-fighters from a ragtag group of students into a confident combat group that makes the show enjoyable to watch from beginning to end. \\n\\n\r\nThe show's plot is somewhat predictable, but the battles themselves are what makes GuP shine. Many of the most important battles are incredibly thrilling, and the show does a great job of making you honestly unsure of what result the battle will conclude in. \\n\\n\r\n(Overall)  \\n\\n\r\nGuP is a thrilling story with satisfying battles and enjoyable plot and character development. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of tanks, anyone who is a fan of well written battles, anyone who enjoys cute girls driving huge death machines, or anyone who wants to learn more  about the world of tank warfare.",

            "content": "STATUS FILE:[ imgur.com/KLTjiwg.png ]\r\nSTORY\r\n\tThe anime revolves around a group of friends who are all part of the senshadou club, a club where the girls must compete with other schools in live-fire WWII tank battles. They also live on a huge ship for some a superbly bad reason. This anime has a nice mix of SoL and strategic action, as well as tonnes of tank related fanservice.\r\n\tThe 'protaganist' or at least the person whose point of view we take for most of the story, is Miho Nishizumi. Although she originally didn't want to join the tankery club, she is actually a talented and experienced tank commander,except for the fact she always has her head poking out of the top of the tank even when under heavy fire.\\n\r\n\tThen there is Hana Isuzu, a flower arranger turned tank gunner who's character is heavily underdeveloped and doesn't say very much, but apparantly she has some family problems and an overzealous butler.\\n\r\n\tSaori is a slut.\\n\r\n\tThe tank's driver, Mako Reizei, is known for being at the top of academics and of school tardiness. Although most of her character is based on her wanting to go to sleep, she also has a nicely done episode about her love for her Grandmother.\\n\r\n\tFinally is the crew's excitable tank maniac, Yukari Akiyama, who incedentally is best girl. She fucking loves tanks. Also fluffy.\\n\r\n\tApart from these five, there are a total of 15,000 other characters, most of which actually get a surprising amount of development considering the series' length. Honourable mention to best team, team hippo. The cast also includes a loli school president, a World of Tanks playing nekomimi, two tea-drinking brits and a hoard of cute nazis and soviets. I'm not even kidding.\\n\\n\r\n\tThroughout the series the girls face other schools in a tournament to try to be the best tankwondo team out there. Each school they face represents a different country and it's tanks, all heavily stereotyped and slightly racist, which is always good. There's the engrish speaking Americans who are all blonde and obnoxious with cowtits; there's the polite and tea-slurping Brits who act as commentators on every battle; there's the pizza loving Italians, the vodka drinking and dancing-round-a-camfire-in-the-snow russians and a regimented and shouty Nazi team who act as the final boss.\\n\\n\r\nPRODUCTION\\n\r\n\tThe animation on this show was slightly hit or miss, ecspecially with the CG parts. All tank battles were done in CG, which worked most of the time, but sometimes made it look like the tanks where toys.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe soundtrack was huge, aswell as very good. Each school had there own set of songs, based on traditional songs fronm their country. Worth a mention is the song called 'Katyusha' a traditionally sung Russian folksong that is sung by the Soviet Tankjutsu'ers as they ride into battle. Fucking brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\n\tIn conclusion this show was amazing, as expected from the famous Actas studio (nope I had never heard of them either), and is definately worth the watch it shines in all aspects, and it even has a movie scheduled for release in November 2015. If you like tanks then you won't be disappointed there either, it even has a set of OVAs which have fluffy explain all about each tank in the team.\\n\\n\r\nAlso lots of implied yuri (apparantly)\\n\\n\r\nMETADATA\\n\r\nLength- \t1 cour / 12 eps / 4.8 hrs\\n\r\nRelease-\tFall 2012\\n\r\nStudio-\tActas\\n\r\nSource-\t2012 Manga by Ryuuichi Saitaniya\\n\r\nAlts-\t\t5x Manga / LN / 2x OVA\\n\\n\r\nRATING\\n\r\nWatch?-\t\t\tYes\\n\r\nBest Character-\tYukari\\n\r\nWorst Character-\tFucking Sodoko and her clones\\n\r\nBest Feature-\t\tThe massive cast\\n\\n\r\n-Be warned that I am biased towards this particular anime-",

            "content": "You know what? If there's a Senshado major in real life, I would definitely choose that since I love things that could pump my adrenaline while building a team that could be my best friends at the same time. For me, Girls und Panzer is one example that making something that is completely fictional like Senshado could be very interesting since we know very much that we could not do that in real life.\r\nTo be honest, I feel that the story and character building inside this anime is too shallow for my taste that even the most relationship development in this anime and that isfamilial relationship between Miho and her sister Maho resolved too fast and not exploring the background more than I expecting. Aside from the main team character development, we did not get many development from other team that I love to know about like that history geeks, Hippo team, or that former volleyball team that should be very explored since they lost their club, Duck team. And I still have that major issue of Ami Chouno being last match's referee. She is the instructor of Oarai for god sake and why Kuromorimine did not do any protest? While weak in the character development and story department, this anime excels in the world building as they made a completely fictional material arts that is Senshado. And not just making it out of nowhere, they made it very interesting to follow.\\n\\n\r\nI always love any anime that twist things with strategies and logical thinking. With Senshado being a material arts involving tanks fighting each other, strategy will of course be a major aspect at the game. Oarai Senshado team are very weak in terms of fire power and amount so they must have smart tricks even just to stay alive at the game. I always love their tactics to overcome the enemy while always being outnumbered by them. Kudos for the writer as they managed to pull ideas about how to make Oarai wins with that condition while the tactics are still make sense and logical. While we know from the very beginning that Oarai will win, the possibility of losing is still there with the enemies have so many plans up their sleeves like the main characters and making every match very interesting and thrilling just want to know how Oarai overcome their disadvantages.\\n\\n\r\nI always love to hear the booming sound of projectile being shot out from the tank. I think every boom they made is different depends on what tank or nozzle they use and it immerses the experience while watching this anime. Huge kudos for sound engineer as they have done a great job. The music is very militarized and I love it since every school have their own theme based on the culture the school bring. I especially love the Russian-esque school, Pravda, as the Russian vibe in their theme song is very strong and on point. Kudos for the music director.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Girls und Panzer brought us another cute girls doing cute things anime but managed to build the world very well while suffers a bit from shallow characters and story line. In the end, Girls und Panzer gave me a pretty good ride as they successfully pumped my adrenaline at every match they have. Next, I think I should watch Girls und Panzer der Film as I wish for a great improvement for this potential.",

            "content": "When it comes to entitlement and birthright, Miho Nishizumi has a lot to be tankful for. Sorry, but I promised I\u2019d make that joke at least once in this review, so at least it\u2019s past us now. She hails from a family of highly trained, highly disciplined practitioners of one of their world\u2019s most popular and prestigious forms of martial arts... Tankery. Yes, in this world, the most globally popular sport isn\u2019t soccer, it\u2019s full blown tank battles, and while it\u2019s full extent is unknown, we do know that there\u2019s a high school division that\u2019s taught as a class, the students of which go towar with other schools in a yearly tournament. There are many nations taking part, and many different styles to contend with, but the Nishizumi family is at the top of the game. With the elegance of Wushu and the power of Krav Maga, the Nishizumi style of Tankery specializes in cold hearted dominance, seizing victory at the cost of all else, and with more than 18 tanks at their disposal, they had the force to overwhelm any opponent, even at the acceptable cost of several of their own units.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is a black sheep in every flock, and the youngest daughter of the Nishizumi family... The comparatively gentle Miho... Doesn\u2019t quite agree with the all-or-nothing approach that her family has long treasured. One day, during an important tournament battle, she abandoned her own tank to save the lives of several of her teammates whose tank had fallen into a deep river. Unfortunately, she\u2019d been driving the flag tank, so when the parked vehicle was shot by enemy fire, her school wound up losing the tournament. Disgraced for her heroism, Miho was spurned by her family, which she repudiated in return. In order to get away from Tankery forever, she transferred to a school that didn\u2019t have that class on it\u2019s curriculum. Little did she know that on her first day at this new school, Tankery class would be brought back, and the student council would all but blackmail her into signing up for it. With the very life she\u2019d been running from having caught up with her, will Miho become the leader her family never saw in her, or will history repeat itself?\\n\\n\r\nHave I ever spoken about Actas before? Have I ever even heard of it before? I don\u2019t think I have, which is understandable, because while they\u2019ve done a ton of minor work on other studios\u2019 projects, they really haven\u2019t done that much on their own. From what I can tell, aside from Girls Und Panzer, the only major work they\u2019ve done was the currently running Princess Principal, on which they shared duties with Studio 3hZ. They did Moetan and a few of what I understand are the less popular Transformers titles, but nothing else of any serious note, which is a shame, because I really like what they did with Panzer. I\u2019ve never really had a problem with moe designs... Or \u2018moe blobs,\u2019 as they\u2019re also sometimes called... But it\u2019s kind of toned down here, taking a more grounded and natural approach to the big-eyed, chin-deprived features that are more closely associated with the trend. The moe design aesthetic works surprisingly well with the eponymous tank action, even if the animation doesn\u2019t blend as smoothly as I\u2019d like.\\n\\n\r\nSee, Girls Und Panzer uses a mix of traditional two-dimensional and more modern three-dimensional animation, and both work really well, at least for the most part. The slice of life aspects of the series, AKA the girls when they\u2019re not operating heavy machinery, are done using 2D animation, and while I wouldn\u2019t say any of it\u2019s bad, it does feel wildly inconsistent. A great deal of it uses limited movement and smart budget saving tricks, such as selective framing and frozen talking heads, but it wouldn\u2019t be to a distracting or noticeable degree if it wasn\u2019t for certain other scenes that are so over-animated that they feel almost like they were done using rotoscope. The tanks in the series are almost always shown in CG, and while their movements don\u2019t always look convincing or well integrated, they both look and move like real tanks, and the level of detail used on them is stunning. Unfortunately, while both sides of the animation are more or less adequate, they can look a bit cringey when both are moving at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nYou get a dose of this right in the first scene of the first episode, where we begin with a POV shot from inside one of the tanks, and we catch several glimpses of moe girls sticking their heads and whole bodies out of their respective tanks, and Good Lord does it look like an awkward combination. They just don\u2019t move the same, and it doesn\u2019t always look... Right. This gets better throughout the series, especially after they figure out that it looks much better to focus the camera on the girls while keeping the camera steady, negating any excess movement from the tanks so that they don\u2019t have to move the girls with them, so it\u2019s easy enough to get over. The character designs tend to get weirder as the cast expands, seeing how the main cast is geared towards normalcy with hairstyles that inform their personalities... The lazy girl has long thick hair, the delicate girl has lighter and fluffier black hair, the love-sick girl has hair that\u2019s long, pampered orange locks, etc... But characters occupying the side tanks feature teams of military buffs, younger girls, girls who all look like clones of each other, so at least you can\u2019t say they got lazy or uncreative with their moe blobs.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, by Shiro Hamaguchi, is mostly set to the style of military march music, and if you want a quick comparison, there\u2019s a track called Panzer Vor that, early on, sounds eerily similar to the theme song from Disney\u2019s Recess. There\u2019s a lot of rolling drums at the base of the music, and it\u2019s overlayed by a handful of different wind instruments, your standard marching band fare. There are a few exceptions, such as in regards to foreign characters, like the British tune The British Grenadiers, which acts as a reverse of a lot of the more standard tunes, as it starts with the flute and then adds in the drums. There was initially a beautifully rendered version of an old Russian folk song on the soundtrack, but because Crunchyroll couldn\u2019t get the rights to it, they had to replace it with something else Russian sounding from the public domain bin. They went, of course, with the Pac Man theme, which didn\u2019t even come close. Another noteworthy track is the cast being forced to sing the Goosefish song, but it\u2019s nothing without it\u2019s insane dance visuals. Honestly though, the most noteworthy music that the dub was able to retain is the opening theme Dreamriser, from the band Chouco, which is absolutely delightful.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub is unfortunately on the disappointing side, as Sentai Filmworks apparently decided that instead of trying to match the moefied voice of the characters... A feat that, like an accurate kansai dialect, is distinctly possible to pull off but still highly difficult... They would instead use more normal, natural sounding American teenage girl voices, most of which hit a lower register than you\u2019d expect from a glance at the characters, and it doesn\u2019t work as well as you\u2019d hope. To be fair, it does start to sound a lot better after a few episodes, especially as Meg McDonald, one of Sentai\u2019s most recent hires at the time, manages to find a connection to her character that may have something to do with the character herself growing in confidence and comfort with each passing episode. Actually, a lot of the cast of this dub are unknown names and recent(at the time) hires, including Rebekah Stevens growing into her role of the excitable tank nerd Yukari and Molly Searcy... Well, honestly being a bit miscast as the sleepy and quiet Mako, as you can just tell she\u2019s struggling to give the character personality despite the restrictions of a lower register.\\n\\n\r\nCaitlynn French was also hired around 2012-2013, but it\u2019s arguable that she\u2019s come a lot farther than her contemporaries since then, with plenty of notable star performances under her belt already, and even though she\u2019s not playing the main character here, she plays around with the role of Hana, a girl trying to transition from the gentle delicacy of flower arrangement to the raw power of firing a tank cannon and finds a lot of character in this dynamic. There are a bunch of veteran actors in the cast, with recognizable voices like Monica Rial and Luci Christian popping up in the rest of the main tank class, and some incredibly talented names like Hilary Haag and Brittany Karbowski getting meatier parts as villains, but the most surprising for me was the boy-crazy Saori, and after stumping me for most of the first episode as I tried to place where I\u2019ve heard her before, it hit me like a ton of bricks that she was played by voice acting veteran Jessica Calvello, who I honestly hadn\u2019t heard in anything since 2003.\\n\\n\r\nI mean, okay, she had like 6 or 7 jobs between 2004 and 2013, but none of them were really high profile, and now, she\u2019s getting lead roles left and right, and deservedly so, with fan favorite performances in Attack on Titan and Maria Holic, to name a few. I\u2019ve mentioned in other reviews how excited I was to see her coming back in a major way to the dubbing industry, and her performance in this is probably it\u2019s biggest saving grace. The first episode does sound a little awkward all around, but she\u2019s the only main actor whom I can confidently say was putting forth maximum effort since the beginning. That\u2019s not to say she makes the dub sound good, however, because the overall grounded voices coming out of characters that are slightly grounded but still over-the-top in design is a hard thing to get used to. Hell, the perfect example of this dub\u2019s problems is the student council president, a short girl with tsundere pigtails whose voice is way too deep for her stature. It\u2019s kinda worth checking out at least once to see what Sentai\u2019s newest hires of this decade are capable of, and to celebrate Calvello\u2019s triumphant return to action, but the sub is way better.\\n\\n\r\nGirls Und Panzer is what I like to call a Gimmick Anime. It\u2019s not deep, it\u2019s not high concept, it\u2019s not a rip-off of anything more successful, it\u2019s not following popular trends... It\u2019s the kind of show(Well, manga, in this case) where the creator was able to come up with one weird, original concept and build a story, world and cast of characters around it. This may sound like a new concept for some of you, but if you think back, there have been plenty of Gimmick anime that have become successful over the years. High School of the Dead and Tiger and Bunny lit up the market back in their day, and over ten years later, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is still finding new ways to expand the universe it built off of it\u2019s gimmick. All you really need to do is take your original idea, set it into a tried and true formula, populate it with archetypal or even subversive characters, and then find ways to market it, so that people get hooked on the new idea while being drawn in by the same old surroundings that the gimmick manages to cover up.\\n\\n\r\nIf that sounds cynical of me, well, that\u2019s because more often than not, Gimmick anime don\u2019t always work, and there are a myriad of problems they can go through. For example, the gimmick can get stale, exposing the characters as running jokes who can no longer support it, which is what happened to Dagashi Kashi, at least in my opinion. You can focus on the gimmick to the point that the series loses it\u2019s sense of direction, which is probably how Bento wound up going off the rails with two unwatchable and thankfully skippable episodes. You can focus way too hard on marketing, which led to Strike Witches going overboard on fanservice to an unforgivable degree, or you can try to make your gimmick show more than the sum of it\u2019s parts and fail miserably, winding up looking stupid and pretentious as a result, like Sasami-san@Ganbaranai. If your main character IS the gimmick, you run the risk of sacrificing plot, story and the rest of the cast as props to support the exploits of said character, like Squidgirl did. Or you could be like C3, and pick a gimmick that feels way too disturbingly similar to real life tragedies.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, to be fair, Girls Und Panzer almost falls to that last issue, with tanks fortunately being a lot more removed from reality than lifelike toy guns and thus not nearly as uncomfortable to think about, but aside from that, it really doesn\u2019t have any of those other problems. It fused it\u2019s gimmick with one of the most enjoyable story structures you can pick, the \u2018underdogs proving themselves in a tournament\u2019 structure template, and in doing so, it was able to keep the story simple, hold to a consistent direction, keep it\u2019s gimmick fresh with the increasing difficulty of each battle and the challenges both during and inbetween, and it had so much realism in the movement of the tanks and the tactical usage of terrain and strategy that they were able to get away with some otherwise ludicrous logic fallacies... Which, to be fair, was more for the sake of keeping the show from crossing the threshold from tank violence to actual human casualties. Yeah, I\u2019ll believe a human sticking out of a tank is too small a target to hit, because a moe show like this one REALLY doesn\u2019t need to get that dark.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, being a tournament style show that only has 12 episodes, it did wind up facing one other potential problem. Using Yuri on Ice as a begrudging example... Seriously, I really wanted to like that show more than I did... It\u2019s entirely possible for a large cast to feel underdeveloped in a story that seems to be focused more on performance performance performance, with interchangeable stock characters just kind of existing for the sake of existing, and it\u2019s just as possible for a show like that one to carry low or even no stakes. Again, though, this is a problem that Girls Und Panzer manages to avoid. The characterization is a bit light, with no individual characters having arcs outside of the tank battles, and the few that do exist being resolved for better or worse by a simple win/loss, and honestly, none of the characters... Not even in the main five... Are particularly memorable as individuals. Even the villains, who are a lot more fun to watch, are little more than stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nUp until my second time through the series, this was my one major problem with it, but now that I\u2019ve seen it again, the characters are developed... Enough. The main cast may not be made of definitive characters, but you know enough about them to like them and to know why they\u2019re in the game, and what they\u2019re getting out of it. They don\u2019t go above and beyond, but it\u2019s acceptable. They even change by the end, albeit in smaller and more subtle ways than some viewers will be used to. The supporting cast is largely interchangeable, but with the exception of some cosplayers towards the end, none of them feel wasted or unimportant. They even wind up getting small arcs to themselves, like when the bumbling underclassmen wind up scoring major achievements in the last fight. Besides, when you really get down to it, this isn\u2019t a character based story... It\u2019s mostly plot driven, and while it\u2019s not going to break any barriers, a team of underdogs surrounded by less important but still kind of interesting stock characters while battling foreign stereotypes that still manage to pull out redeeming qualities whenever needed is a scenario that\u2019s more than enough to support a tournament show.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, Girls Und Panzer\u2019s biggest accomplishment is in execution. The parts for the most part don\u2019t feel like anything special or revolutionary, but when it all comes together, you wind up with an intense, energetic sports anime that\u2019s able to use likeable characters and smart writing to create a series of truly heart-pounding fights, full of devastating twists and sudden, unexpected challenges that you can\u2019t help but cheer every after every single one that they overcome. I will admit that I had a lot of problems with the first episode, and I found it really despicable that the student council would use such cruel and extreme tactics to force Miho to take tankery, but even that becomes forgivable about halfway through the series when you realize that there isn\u2019t just the joy of success and the developing bond of the tankery class on the line, oh no, there are actual stakes at play here, and the more you grow to love and identify with these characters, the more you\u2019ll want them to overcome all odds and win it all. Not bad for a show that needed two inbetween ova episodes to help us keep up with all of it\u2019s characters.\\n\\n\r\nGirls Und Panzer is available from Sentai filmworks. The inbetween episodes I just mentioned are all available on the home release. A six episode OVA series is also available from the same company, along with another OVA and the first of seven feature films, although I\u2019ve seen none of these, so I can\u2019t speak as to their quality. Two different manga series, Girls Und Panzer and Girls Und Panzer Little Army, are available stateside from publisher Seven Seas. There are actually a ton of different manga titles (and one game) that aren\u2019t available stateside, along with one light novel, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get them eventually.\\n\\n\r\nGirls Und Panzer is by no means a masterpiece, but it still had every excuse in the book to not be as great as it is. Not only was it saddled with a production team that hasn\u2019t done anything else of note until this year, it was also limited to 12 episodes and almost as many named characters as Fullmetal Alchemist had, and despite these problems, the final product is nothing short of amazing. It has some flaws, but aside from the easily excusable logic and safety issues, the only problems that hold me back from giving it a perfect score are the occasionally shakey animation and the handful of character arcs that get resolved way too easily at the end. None of these problems keep the series from being a blast from start to finish, nor do they manage to derail that overall feeling that the people working on it fully enjoyed what they were doing and believed in it with complete sincerity. I know a world where recreational tank battles have achieved world-wide popularity is a hard concept to imagine, but this series makes me believe in it one hundred freaking percent. It\u2019s exciting, it\u2019s smart, it\u2019s suspenseful, and it\u2019s honestly one of those rare titles that I\u2019d recommend to just about anyone. I give Girls Und Panzer a 9/10.",

            "content": "I first watched it for the tanks when it came out but over the years I have revisited and rewatched it multiple times (3rd time now). In general, it's a pretty good and unique take on the military slice of life genre (similar to High School Fleet, Kantai Collection or Upotte for example), but instead of ships or guns it has tanks.\r\nThe first few episodes are slow to warm up and don't provide much in the way of character development; that seems to happen as the series progresses on, with half of some episodes being dedicated to exploring certain characters and their backgrounds. In sayingthis, however, the supporting characters (leaders of the other schools in particular) are pretty much just shallow stereotypes of their representative schools; the rowdy American, the eloquent Briton, and so on. There is really not much expanded on them at all other than their presentation. The sequel to the series (Der Film) expands more on the backstories of Miho and Maho, though even that does it badly in how Jatkosota (a Finnish themed team) is introduced with almost no explanation whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nObviously \"Girls und Panzer\" has two parts to it as referenced in the title: The girls and the tanks, and without the tanks it would be a pretty generic slice of life show. The design and depiction of the tanks themselves were very good and the interiors in particular were accurately designed and animated. I'd say everything is perfect about them except for the depiction of physics (such as the tanks famously \"drifting\" and racing through the streets), though because it's an anime it's something that can be looked over. The battles themselves are pretty okay, especially the final battle which I will admit had me pretty on edge.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say it's a decent watch. For a military buff like myself it's definitely exciting to see the amazing detail put into the tanks despite the depiction of the physics being unrealistic, but I think that besides that it's quite simplistic. Not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but I would think that it would be somewhat boring for someone who isn't a military buff (in saying that, someone who's a hardcore military buff will find themselves nitpicking the unrealistic aspects very often).",

            "content": "\"Man, watching that anime about tanks was so pure!\" - words I never thought I would utter.\r\nI initially picked this up from hearing about it here and there and came in with zero expectation or knowledge, and at that point hadn't really watched anything similar. What I was greeted with was a very easy-to-watch and casual anime which I enjoyed start to finish. It's by no means my favourite, sure, but I'm definitely glad I picked it up.\r\nThe characters and settings here are all delightful and for the most part uplifting. Despite there being moderate peril in places, nothing at all really sinks you intosadness, which is one of the show's strengths.\\n\\n\r\nEven now, I think Girls Und Panzer is one of the better drawn animes I have watched, even years on. The 3D parts were even alright (or at least, overshadowed by how bad some other shows are at it), which was good to see. The environments and characters are both visually pleasing, and I'm a big fan of the artstyle the show goes with.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has an alright, but by no means revolutionary, plot. It had a good narrative throughout, and nothing seemed to be all that terse about it. I didn't really feel that much in the way of tension at any point just because some of the plot felt a little predictable, but I'm not so sure that plot-twists are one of the reasons people would really pick up this show.\\n\\n\r\nI do have to highlight the military-esque brass soundtrack that pops up throughout, it was a nice touch! I definitely enjoyed it and it helped make the anime so easy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a nice, soothing anime about war machines. Oxymoronic? Maybe, but it's something that works a lot better than one my expect. Finally proof that tanks can be cute.",

I dont have much knowledge about tank except that tanks are soo cool.\r\nStory\r\n\tthe story is about Cute Girls driving tanks. the story starts with a girl named Nishizumi Miho, which is from a family famous for Tankwando, she transfered to a different school that don't have tankwando for some reason and to avoid from participating in it. But alas, the student council re-established the school's tankwando and Misho was forced to participate in it.\r\n\tthe story is really enganging from start to finish. I really loved the tank battleswhich they won despite their huge disadvantage, all thanks to the brilliant tactics of Miho-chan. At first, it didn't really matters if they win or lose, but when they finally found out the reason why the schools tankwando was re-established, they become more motivated to win the tournament.\\n\r\n\tMy favorite battle was the Finals and the opponent was her former school and team which is being lead by her big sister Nishizumi Maho. That was a great battle, it gives me the feeling that there's really a war going on between two nation. Tanks versus tanks, tactics versus Tactics, this is what I'm looking for when watching this kind of anime, a battle scene that can moved your heart and can bring tears to your eyes. \\n\r\n\tI really love the opening song of Girls Und Panzer, \"DreamRiser\" by Choucho and i didn't skip it even once. I't really suits with the anime coz everytime i hear that song it brings me back to the battlefield filled with girls and tank.\\n\r\n\tI really love this anime. It has given me the excitement that I'm looking for and because of that, i rewatched it a week later coz i can't stop thinking about it. Cute Girls. Cool Tanks. Youth. Friendship. Rivalry. I couldn't ask for more.\\n",

            "content": "Panzer Vor!!!\r\nWhat an incredible anime! I cant believe its over!! I was super excited watching it the Whole time!!! Tanks Drifting, and Tanks shooting, and Tanks Going Fast. Then when a tank gets shot, you wait those 3 seconds to hear the little, \"FFFSSTTTT\" of the little white flag popping out of the tank to show not to shoot at it anymore!! This was an Incredible Anime!!!!  I really want more!\r\nI had originally planned on watching 3-4 episodes so I could Watch the next episode of Oreimo, but then it got really good after the 1st episode, and i just kept watching it andwatching it, until i finished it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story was Very Easy to Follow, and It had great depth.  It made me want more, and I wanted them to have more fights, and more tanks!!!  The part that got me was when they showed that they lived on a fucking ship.  A SHIP!!  A BOAT!!!  I Was Not expecting that!!!  They never really explain why.  I mean they kind of do, but not in that great of detail.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art had its hiccups here and there, but Hey, its by a studio that nobody really knows, and everyone has their own art style.  This one was Great, and Had incredible Detail to the Tanks themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound was Great too!  Every time a tank was shooting, You'd know it!  And I loved the Little sound of the Flag when it would pop up.  Every Time I would sit there and imitate it with a thumbs up when the flag popped up!  \"FFSSTTT\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were fun and different for each one.  They all had their personalities that you really just love about it.  I mean the Main Character was great and level headed.  The Slow Sleepy person was enjoyable, and all the other people each had their own personality that you really cant find in much other anime.  Its totally different than other anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf I told you I enjoyed it, then that would be the biggest understatement I ever said.  I enjoyed it very much.  I was Freaking out the whole time, because it was so much fun to watch.  Watching as the people were missing each shots, and i would say, AW I CAN DO THAT ON BATTLEFIELD EASY!!!!, then saying to myself, well, the game and real life, and this anime are 3 different things.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 9.  Why? because It was too short.  12 episodes for this anime that has such huge scope to it?  They should have done a lot more!  I think it has the ability to span across at least 2, 24 episode seasons.    I honestly would pay for them to make more of it, and I'm Poor. They have the ability for it, and they left it off to where they could do it with no problems.",

            "content": "\"Cute Girls Doing Cute Things- now with Tanks\"\r\nSounds curious? It certainly is.\r\nHello, this is my first review, please be patient with me.\r\nFirst off, I am not really a fan of this \"cute girls doing cute things\"-genre.\r\nI didn't even consider watching it and only did it because I was very bored and a little bit curious.\r\nThat said, it shouldn't be very surprising that I didn't enjoy the first few episodes.\r\nAt least until I arrived at the first battle. Suddenly things got far more interesting.\r\nBut one thing after another. I should start with the Art.\r\nArt- 9 points\r\nMuch love and detail. That is what you can expect.\r\nThe Tankslook realistic, at least in my amateur eyes, and are drawn with great detail.\\n\\n\r\nA special piece of candy is the Background. It creates a lively and much more realistic Atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nDisappointments are only the Characters. Everyone looks a little too simple drawn, for my taste. I still like the facial expressions, without being overdrawn they deliver the thoughts and reactions pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really have much to say about the Art, only that it is pretty good all in all.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9 points\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds are one more thing that makes the Anime enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nBgms are often made for a specific Nation, after that the schools are made, and it is what breathes life into them.\\n\\n\r\nTanks sound very nice as well, even if I never heard one in real life.\\n\r\nThey sympathise and enhance the Anime greatness.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 3 points\\n\\n\r\nI will try my best not to spoiler here, even though I can't promise anything.\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much Story, what is not necessarily bad. Even little Story, well executed, can make a good impression. Sadly it is not the case here.\\n\r\nBecause of the easygoing Atmosphere, that is displayed outside the battles, important Story elements go under.\\n\\n\r\nThe writers tried to build up the Story and rise questions and suspicions that something is not right. But lack of seriousness covers this and it is hardly visible.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"cute girls do cute things\"-thing backfires here as well. Because of this some elements that would add to the up building of the story, look like they are just a hunch to let the girls do some cute things.\\n\r\nWell that does not count for every scene, but for some.\\n\\n\r\nIt is probably the biggest let down for the Anime. A little bit more drama may have done wonders.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 5 points\\n\\n\r\nThere is not really something special about the characters. They have a depth as deep as a slice of bread. The Main Character goes a bit deeper, but it's still not enough to catch a fish.\\n\\n\r\nSome girls have their little trials with a little Character development. But it is not much.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that it somehow fits the show, somehow it would steal a lot of the overall Atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nStill, in comprehension of the story section, it is acceptable and doesn't spoil the fun too much. At least in my option, people that value character development a lot may be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8 Points\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part this will be about the Battles. Surprisingly the Anime shines here the most.\\n\\n\r\nDo I need to be a tank nerd to even understand a word?\\n\r\nA question that may rise up here, for some.\\n\r\nIt doesn't hurt to be one, and should make your heart pound. Hopefully.\\n\r\nBut even if you are not one, like me, it is still understandable.\\n\r\nEverything is explained and reasonable, even if unique and surprising.\\n\\n\r\nThey do not just drive up, in a row and shoot until only one is left standing.\\n\r\nThere are tactics and thoughts behind it. Like where to move and how to make an advantage, without needing to read a book about such things (well a little bit of knowledge is necessary, but it is all basics, so you shouldn't worry about it)\\n\\n\r\nWell, if it is this great why only 8 points?\\n\r\nI don't really feel like it deserves a higher Score. I appreciate that they gave a lot of effort to make it amazing as it is. But as I said before, the lack of seriousness and drama is a minus point. \\n\\n\r\nAtmosphere and unique and thought out battles just don't make up for it, to be really epic. It did score poorly on the Story as well, what should be a part of the enjoyment as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-7 points\\n\\n\r\nThis Anime has two, very different sides. On one Side is the daily life of the girls and on the other are the battles. For all that are into it, both sides are entertaining and probably like it.\\n\\n\r\nFor all others some episodes may be a drag where nothing really interesting happens, While you can't wait to see how it continues at other points.\\n\\n\r\nCounting everything together, it still has the potential to be enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThat is all for my review.\\n\r\nThank you for your time reading it.",

It simply followed a common (but not unsuccessful) setup. No big wins for originality at its core but I was happy with it. \r\nThe characters were fun and many were very relate-able. \r\nLastly, despite this being a world where high school girls drive tanks around, it felt really natural and Ididn't feel like I was being thrown into this kind-of sci-fi environment without explanation.

ONE MOTORCYCLES!!!\" (or Yu-Gi-oh! 5D's). I mean we are talking about young girls that ride  tanks! But the case is very different. This is an anime full of enjoyment that handles and exploits its unique plot at its best.\r\nFirst of all the art here is top-notch. The characters despite their really average style -  \"kawai\" school girls- are designed each one in a way that highlights their personalities. The battlefield planes and themovement of all the characters and the tanks is really smooth and give a good pace to the overall plot.  \\n\\n\r\nMoreover the story is pretty interesting. The cliches are mostly absent even in the fighting scenes. No big speeches, no last minute saves or anything of that nature. The plot gave me each thing at the time unveiling the necessary part of the story; I ended up only wanting more in the end!\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I did not like was the opening, which was too generic, and the voice acting which was somewhat pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this is great anime. I recommend it even if you do not like lolies. It has comedy, suspense and of course it has tanks!",

            "content": "Welcome to this way to late review, but since GuP was the first anime I've ever watched I wanted to write it anyway. Disclaimer: GuP is also one of my favourite animes so prepare yourself a review that might not be as nuanced as others.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story in Girls und Panzer is quite straightforward although the true plotline that drives the characters is only revealed somewhat over halfway the entire anime. The story is not really why you would watch Girls und Panzer though, as the tankcombat is predominantly why most, including myself, watched the anime in the first place. This doesn't take away thatGirls und Panzers has a well written script, it has quite a lot of historical references in it that really points to clever writing. Some \"easter eggs\" are not so easy to find though as I only spotted them in my second or third rewatch. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really like the artstyle for Girls und Panzer. The tanks are all accurately displayed and the character models themselves are nicely drawn. I won't lie that I really like moe character designs. If you dislike the moe artstyle, GuP might not be for you.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe tank sounds sound realistic and the voice overs are very nicely made. The soundtrack is awesome as it uses classical military pieces of a country to play together with the high schools which are based on the said countries. F.e. Pravda Girls High School, the USSR styled highschool, uses Katyusha as their soundtrack while St-Gloriana's Girls High School uses The British Grenadiers. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a lot of characters, A LOT. Oarai, the high school which is the main focus of the anime, has 32 members on it's own. Every single one of these characters has some kind backstory, although some not as much as others. All the other schools have at least 2-3 named characters too, all with their own personality and quirks. \\n\r\nThe Main characters are all very likeable and the MC of the MC's, Miho Nishizumi has a very interesting backstory. \\n\r\nI've never felt any characters to be lacking something which results in this excellent score.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI've not felt bored for one second while watching this anime, even after my 4th rewatch I still find it incredibly amusing. Watching it together with friends is also really fun if you can find a friend who is up for it at least!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said at the start of this review, it was going to be quite un-nuanced. I really enjoy GuP and I would recommend it to everyone who likes Moe, Tanks and just wants to have a good time while watching an anime. Girls und Panzer is definitely a feel good anime! \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading and if I convinced you, Enjoy!\\n",

The things that I love about it are quite simple, it has good art and sound design and a decent sports tournament story (if a little cliche). \r\nUndeniably the biggest factor that made me fall so in love with this show is just how much fun it is. It's a stupid show about girls in tanks fighting with said tanks, it has a stupid premise and the show just runs with it. It is clear to me that the people who worked on thisshow put passion and effort into this dumb show about tank fighting and that makes me love it even more.\\n\r\nAside from the fact that it is just pure dumb fun, it is for the most part, just an upbeat happy show. There are moments when it does get a bit serious, but that doesn't detract from the sense of upbeat happiness that the show is full to the brim with.\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer also has, in my opinion, some of the best fight scenes that I have seen in animation. The way that the tanks move and interact with each-other is really well animated and aside from some stupid things like tank drifting, the shows fights do stay fairly realistic.\\n\r\nAll of this just kind of clashes together and creates magnificence.",

            "content": "Girls Und Panzer mixes two things that go together very naturally. Moe schoolgirls and Tanks.\r\nThe story is rather simple. In this day and age it is the lady-like thing to drive vehicles of mass destruction. Each school has its own tank club which wages \"war\" with other schools in battles of panzerfen.\r\nHowever, the tank battles are amazing. Each episode has this odd mix of tension and moe that seem to be balanced perfectly. It's always interesting to see how the undertanked and under experienced Oarai Girls Academy uses strategy to win their matches.\r\nThe characters are all pretty decent. None of them except Miho (who startsoff by hating tank operating for story reasons) get any development, but they all have a certain charm to them. A lot of them are rather cliched, but mesh together very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonist (other school) characters are varied and each represents a different country and brings new obstacles for the characters. No tank battle is the same!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is kinda middling. In the first episode (among the only episodes with no tank battles) there is not really much to see, but parts of the tank battle they really used more of the budget on it especially later on as the show gained a lot of traction in Japan. The music that plays is very military (like anthem like or old patriotic stuff) which usually represents the country they are fighting. It's not spectacular, but fits very well.\\n\\n\r\nGirls Und Panzer hits most of its targets. It has an inoffensive cast and compelling tank battles. The quality of episodes stays the same or gets better with each one meaning there is not a lot of let down as far as the show goes. I salute this anime.",

            "content": "Girls und Panzer (lit. \u201eGirls and Tanks\u201c) is the most successful anime so far of the comparatively  unknown studio Actas. It was released in 2012 and pretty much offers exactly what the name indicates.\r\nIt\u00b4s about a fictional sport called tankery and centers around Miho Nishizumi, who tries to lead her  academy to victory in a big annual tournament and not much else. If you expect mainly a Slice of Life with cute girls doing cute stuff, than you will be surprised with what this anime actually does. While cute girls are indeed all you will see for the whole show, the producers focusedvery heavily on the fictional sport of tankery. Almost the entire series consists of the matches as well as the preparations for the matches.\\n\\n\r\nThis makes Girls und Panzer a comedic  action show, and it is actually one worth watching too. The story moves along at a nice pace and despite the heavy focus on the sport itself, you also will see some nice character development too. The supporting characters are highly entertaining and funny, especially those from abroad.\\n\\n\r\nIf the various stereotypes surrounding the other academies are funny or just annoying is probably completely up to the viewer. Personally I had a good laugh about all these clich\u00e9s thrown at me (like the English team drinking tea all the time and so on), but it might be a turnoff for others. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw of this series, apart from the easily predictable outcome of the matches,  is clearly the animation.  Actas tried their best but they do not have the budget bigger studios have and it shows. While they put a lot of love for details in the tanks themselves (which are all after real tanks used in world war II), the same cannot be said for the backgrounds, and the faster scenes stutter a little bit too. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I honestly don\u00b4t think this should keep anyone from watching this anime. It\u00b4s highly entertaining, it\u00b4s only 12 episodes and hey\u2026most importantly it\u00b4s girls driving tanks and blowing stuff up! Which guy wouldn\u00b4t wanna see this?\\n\\n\r\nIf you like the TV series, Girls und Panzer also offers you quite a bit of bonus material and extras. There is an extended episode on the match against Anzio (which is the only one not fully shown in the TV series) and also six OVAs for those who would like to learn more about the tanks featured throughout the series. Also watch out for a two hour long movie coming out in November this year!\\n\\n\r\nI give Girls and Panzer a solid 7 and also recommend to watch this subbed rather then dubbed.\\n",

            "content": "Girls und Panzer is a military, school anime created by Actas. The anime has 12 episodes and aired from October 9th, 2012 to March 25th, 2013. \r\nStoryline (8/10)\r\nGirls und Panzer follows high schooler, Miho Nishizumi and her friends as they practice Sensha-do, the martial arts of tanks/Panzers. Miho\u2019s school, Oarai high school takes part in a national Sensha-do championship after the student council revived the art. While Miho is from a family well known in the art, trauma from her previous school holds her back from wanting to participate in the competition. In the end she joins her new friends as they try to winthe championship and faces a number of different schools, all of which used different Panzers from around the world. The story is well paced for the most part but feels rushed half way into the season. One part that feels rushed is when Miho and friends, make it out they in for a hard fight but the viewer never gets to see it and only told that Oarai won. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation of the Panzers in the show is very well done, as attention to detail of each Panzer makes it easy for the viewer to tell each Panzer apart. The animation of Panzer fights is great, as each Panzer moves realistically. The characters themselves are also designed well, as each character has a unique look to himself/herself, making it easy to tell who\u2019s who. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe uses of real life Panzer sounds, from the sound of the engine to the firing of shells, helps bring the show to life. The opening song, \"DreamRiser\" by Choucho and the ending song, \"Enter Enter MISSION!\" by Ankou Team, sounds great and creates a more joyful mood for the anime. The characters' voices have been used in an interesting way and as each school is based in a different country, the characters speaks with variegated accents and uses Panzers unique to its country. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nMiho Nishizumi, voiced by Mai Fuchigami \u2013 She is Ankou team\u2019s commander and the leader of her school\u2019s team. She is from a well-known Sensha-do family, but has tried to avoid Panzers ever since a traumatic event took place at her last school, She is also very caring about her friends' feelings and is always considerate.\\n\\n\r\nSaori Takebe, voiced by Ai Kayano \u2013 She is Ankou team\u2019s radio operator. She is one of the people who befriends Miho on her first day. She joins Miho in Sensha-do in an attempt to become more popular with the guys.\\n\\n\r\nHana Isuzu, voiced by Mami Ozaki \u2013 She is Ankou team\u2019s Gunner. She also befriends Miho on her first day. She was unhappy with her way of life, and decidesed to take up Sensha-do with her friends in order to change her life. After a while, she falls in love with her team\u2019s Panzer main gun. (The love part seems like a spoiler XD)\\n\\n\r\nYukari Akiyama, voiced by Ikumi Nakagami \u2013 She is Ankou team\u2019s loader. She is Panzer otaku and has a vast knowledge of them, which is helpful for her team. \\n\\n\r\nMako Reizei, voiced by Yuka Iguchi \u2013 She is Ankou team\u2019s driver. She is a quiet and gloomy girl, who is always late to school because she hates mornings. She can instantly learn anything by reading, but even though she is top in class, she does Sensha-do to earn more credits to make up for her being late all the time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI found Girls und Panzer to be an enjoyable anime to watch; while it wasn\u2019t mind blowing or one of the best I've ever watched, it still had great elements. I found the story to be interesting, even though some parts felt rush, like the hype fight that the viewer never sees. The attention to detail on the Panzers is great and brings them to life for the viewer. The characters also had a lot of work put into them as they behavior and speech patterns reflect which school and country they are from. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nIn the end Girls und Panzer is an anime that while isn\u2019t one of best you can watch, it still delivers a good story and some good action with Panzers fighting each other. As such, if you like Panzers, young girls fighting or are looking to try something different, then I recommend giving Girls und Panzer a try. \\n",

            "content": "Like a lot of people, Girls und Panzer is a show that didn't succeed in catching my attention at first. Not because I don't like cute; personally, I seldom get tired of cute anime girls doing cute things. No, Girls und Panzer was a hard sell for me just because the premise seemed so weird. Cute girls mixed with military weaponry is fun, but shouldn't they be fighting some great threat a la Strike Witches? Having tank combat just be a school club activity for the girls, It just seemed odd to me somehow, so I wasn't sure about it and ultimately held off. Astime went on, I kept hearing about the series though and my interest started to get piqued. Eventually I had to check it out for myself. Doing so now, I can see quite clearly what the fuss is all about. Girls und Panzer is an anime worth getting excited over.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer is also an exceedingly simple anime. You couldn't get much more simple. The titles says it all here as you have girls and you have panzers. The premise is just a little weird, yes, but they set it up well enough that it's soon not anything to really think about. Girls fight each other with tanks as a martial art in this anime's world. There really isn't so much else to it; the story of the series is exceptionally mundane. It's basically the ultimate cliche sports story; underdog school team has to overcome impossible odds and win the big tournament or else their school will get shut down. It's something we've all seen before and the nuances to it are limited. Yet while not heavy or original in story, Girls und Panzer is far from a poorly written or dumb anime. On the contrary, when dealing with what it wants to focus on, it is never anything but exceptional. What it happens to want to focus on are girls and panzers.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to girls, Girls und Panzer has a ton. You need multiple girls to run a tank and tank battles call for multiple tanks, so that means lots of girls to get to know. Of course, Girls und Panzer is a 12 episode anime so obviously it doesn't have the time to flesh out characters for quite so many girls; in most cases each tank team is characterized simply; you got one tank jam packed full of cute first year students, another tank commanded by the school's history nerds and so on. This works to bring life to the minor characters while not requiring they be developed at length individually. Leaders of the opposing tank teams are developed similarly through associations with the nation they're school are supposed to represent. \\n\\n\r\nAside from maybe the student council tank team, however, most of the actual character development is spared for the tank team of the main characters. The five central characters are all fairly well defined. The main character, Miho, is a typical if inherently likable one; stronger and more collected than she seems, but also reticent and in need of her friends for support. Mako, the driver, is detached and sleepy but compassionate. Saori, the radio operator is energetic and friendly. Hana, the gunner is gentle and soft spoken, but also strong and willful. Yukari, the loader, is the kind of goofy one who is also a big panzer nerd. The character development each receives individually is limited to a few sequences each, but they develop a lot together through each tank battle, and as more time is spent with these characters they becoming increasingly endearing. They're the sort of characters it's hard not to root for.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls are key, but the tanks are about equally important. I don't really know anything about tanks, but lots of research has clearly gone into the specifics of them, which really strengthens just how they are rendered and used. The battles are complex and involving. This is where the show shines its best. Battle sequences, for me are one of the most difficult things to engage me with, but the battles in Girls und Panzer were never dull and in fact had me watching with anticipation to see just how the girls would pull it off. These sequences are the true heart of the show; they're where the girls grow the most, where they're the most in their element and where the show's genius is allowed to shine through. Truly some of the most memorable and satisfying battle sequences I can recall in any anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also looks excellent. The tank battles exciting and well animated, with CG well incorporated. The later battles in particular are gorgeous, the snow battle being my particular favorite. The girls are also well drawn and usually well animated. It's also well acted and uses music to great effect, especially in the battles. Both opening and ending themes are cute and memorable. The presentation on a whole is pretty exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nEverything about Girls und Panzer is a lot of fun. It's kind of a difficult anime not to get sucked into. The girls are cute and endearing and the tank battles are intense and impressive. It does everything so well it's very easy to forgive it's slight and unremarkable story. Fans of tanks and fans of girls will find a nothing but rewarding experience.",

            "content": "I honestly shouldn't have liked this anime. From the sadly large amount of anime I've watched, you'd think I'd know to stay away from something that I can only describe as \"moe tanks.\" However, I gave into my friend's harping, and sat down and took this predictable yet intriguing show in all at once, and: I'd recommend it. \r\nStory: 7\r\nHear me out. The show's story revolved around a group of high school girls (who go to school on some sort of floating town carrier ship?) as they try to win the tankery championship. This sounds completely ridiculous. It is. Yet, the staff managed to weavethis completely...inconceivable...and ill-developed story into something that seemed fully plausible. By the end of it, I felt like I was watching any regular sports anime. I found myself invested in the concept of the story by one simple line in the first episode that goes something like, \"It's a bit weird to think of a guy doing tankery. It's so feminine!\" It dragged me into this world where nothing was really explained, and tankery was somehow exclusively female (like American football, I guess). I give this a 7 because the show managed to leave me thinking about tankery like it was an average sport, never mind the weird floating ships of schools. It was such a uniquely weird topic, that I became invested in learning about tanks, which I knew nothing of before. I paid attention, I learned, and I was dragged in. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe dimensions on the girls' faces when side-facing annoyed me to no end. Other than that, the art was generally moe. I would give it a 5 or 6 if I wasn't so impressed by the movements of the tanks and how they were animated. Seriously, I found myself staring at their almost-meticulous detailing rather than the girls' faces. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nI hate moe soundtracks, and that's exactly what this had. It was a bit forcedly feminine, but neither the OP or ED were what I'd call \"bad.\" They were average. The background music throughout the series was also average. The only thing I found remarkable was this kind-of weird rendition of some characters singing a Russian war song...alright.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThe character developments were all completely predictable. Common family in-fighting, get's resolved, everyone's more or less content. Some crying here and there. There were so many girls in this show, that the 12 episodes couldn't really explore any of their personalities or backgrounds in depth other than a few main characters. Even those were pretty surface level. Honestly, only one of the main characters stood out to me (the poofy-haired one), but I can't even remember her name, because, at the end of the day, the show threw so many names at me that I only remembered the protagonist's name. The protagonist, Miho, was a fairly average trope, but I enjoyed her more than I thought because the show didn't resort to all of the typical cliches with her, and she displayed great battle acumen by the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI KNOW. A 9. UGH. This seems uncalled for, and it is. The story really, seriously, drew me in. I ended up on, like, 20 tank Wikipedia pages and was Youtubing videos of M4 Shermans firing by the end of the show. The fact that I was pulled in from the beginning into treating the show like a sports anime made it, honestly, insanely fun to watch matches. I knew what the outcome of each of them would be, but the team who created this seriously researched their military stuff. The tactics were fun and realistic, the tanks moved in a captivating way, and the enemies were all unique. I felt the care that went into production for this show, and I loved watching it all unfold. This show presented a unique combination of something like a soccer anime and a historical war anime, and had me smiling in every match. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nUltimately, though I seriously enjoyed it, the I think that this show failed to expand on the possibilities that it had to work with. The characters lacked depth, and the outcome of everything from the character drama to the match outcomes were highly predictable. Nothing was really outstanding other than the unique story. Still, the weirdness of the story managed to pull everything else up with it, and I found myself at the edge of my seat for the matches, even though I thought this would be some moe sports anime that was meant to appeal to military-game fans.\\n\\n\r\nReceiving a solid 7, I recommend this anime for anyone looking for a unique and somehow refreshing mishmash of sports, military, and moe.",

The characters are charming, their motivations are clearly established and the interactions between them are pleasantly satisfying. The comedy is gentle but amusing and well-timed. There's nothing that really pushes the boat out here.\r\n...with the exception of its total, straight-faced commitment to a fantastically, spectacularly bizarre premise, which has forever enshrined Girls und Panzer as a personal favourite of mine. \r\nIt's a perfect example of everything I love about anime in general. Where the hell else are you going to see this? Someone sat down at a conferencetable somewhere and pitched a 'High school sports comedy/drama where the sport is painstakingly accurately depicted WWII tank battles', and then the guy on the other side of that table said yes! \\n\\n\r\nAnd then they made that show!",

            "content": "It\u2019s not a complex story, unexpected plot-twists or character development which makes this show ingenious. No It\u2019s something slightly different. Let me describe it.\r\nWell this might be long-track run but I want to make sure everybody understands why this show deserves 10/10 score.\r\nFirst of all I have a feeling that most of the people who gave this anime bad score, dropped it or marked is as ,,cancer\u201c simply aren\u2019t the target audience. So before we move to describing what is the anime about it would be good idea to describe WHO IS THIS ANIME FOR. \r\nAnd the answer is pretty easy... WWII/MILITARY nerds. This showwas simply made by WWII enthusiasts for WWII enthusiasts. Of course, if you can\u2019t tell the difference between Sherman and Tiger (and after watching this you probably will be able to) you can still enjoy the show... But remember that those WWII neets will enjoy the show six times more... Why is it like this?\\n\\n\r\nWell as I said, there is one thing that makes this show glorious... \\n\r\nR E F E R E N C E S. This show is full of WWII/ military references and ,,inside jokes\u201c. Some of them are so obvious that you will get them even if you didn\u2019t pay attention in history class... Some of them are so well hidden that only consecrated people will understand. And I personally believe that I also missed some.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t want to know further reasons, then I can tell you this: It\u2019s not for everyone but it does excellent  job for its target audience.Maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s still alive even several years after its release and there is another sequel airing... \\n\\n\r\nOne more thing before moving to describing the plot and stuff. Since this was my first anime, I can clearly confirm, that even if you are not into anime, you can still watch it, and maybe it will make you consider watching anime more and more (just like in my case, but as I heard from multiple people, I am not the only one who can call this ,,a gate to anime world\u201c. Maybe it\u2019s because it lacks typical ,,cringy or weird\u201c anime stuff like ,,white blank eyes\u201c, running with hands behind and so on... I guess some hardcore otakus will refer this as a \u201econ\u201c, but I think this stuff is not suitable for this kind of anime anyways...\\n\\n\r\nFine... With that said,  I can move on to describing the plot... Okay I will try to make this spoiler free but... Some minor spoilers might occur.\\n\\n\r\nSo what Is this show about?\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in a world where high school girls and women in general are allowed to participate in a sport (or techically martial art) called Sensha-do (the way of tank), in english translation often reffered as ,,Panzerfahren\u201c (tank driving). But I prefer calling it  ,,tankery\u201c. Only women can participate in this, and people believe, that this will make them good wives (no really who wouldn\u2019t like his wife to be able to drive those steel monsters?)\\n\\n\r\nIt all takes place in a city called ,,Ooarai\u201c, which is a real place btw, and many locations portrayed in anime could be found there actually.  The main protagonist of the series, Miho Nishizumi (yup that girl on my profile pic) just transfered to Ooarai girls\u2018 school. Even though she is from famous noble family that has a tradition in tankery, she came here because this school doesn\u2018t offer it. (name Nishizumi refers to WWII japanese tank ace 1st Lt. Kojiro Nishizumi , Voila! The first reference is here). However Ooarai school decided to start participating in tankery again. And Miho is forced to lead them. She also meets new friends (Yukari Akiyama, real WWII nerd who is basically alter ego of average GuP fan, Hana Isuzu who comes from noble family as well, yet her family is focused on ,,flower arranging\u201c instead of driving tanks, Saori Takebe who tries to get a boyfriend and tends to give love advice even though she has no experience, and Mako Reizei, inteligent but sleepy girl who has problems with attendance). The story follows Ooarai tankery team on its way to win 63rd National tournament, which is (as later discovered) nescessary to keep the school open. So much for the plot, now let\u2019s take a look at those references more precisely:\\n\\n\r\nSchools:\\n\\n\r\nEach school in this anime represents one nation that participated in WWII or simply existed during that time and had some tanks. These schools are basically the most obvious references, not just school names but even insignias are made in a way everybody knows which country they represent. Also school uniforms are heavily inspired by actual army uniforms of those countries. And when I say heavily I mean heavily...\\n\\n\r\nSo far We have following schools:\\n\\n\r\nPravda - means ,,truth\u201c in russian, it\u2018s Soviet Union inspired school\\n\\n\r\nSt. Gloriana - such British inspired much Posh school\\n\\n\r\nSaunders \u2013 Murica inspired school, fu*k yeah!\\n\\n\r\nAnzio - named after a town in Italy,( The Battle of Anzio, I\u2019m sure you know \\n\r\nwhat I\u2019m talking about), yes this is an Italian inspired school\\n\\n\r\nKuromorimine (Schwarzwaldspitze or Black Forest Peak) is Ze German inspired school (and one of the strongest  btw)\\n\\n\r\nOoarai - this school doesn\u2019t represent any specific nation, it\u2019s mixed. All tanks are divided among ,,teams\u201c each team is called after an animal and operates one tank. So far we have Ankou team (Miho and her friends) Hippo team (History club members) Rabbit team (1st graders) Turtle team (student council) and few others...\\n\\n\r\nJatkosota - Finnish themed school\\n\\n\r\nSelection University - uses american WWII, early post war tanks and british Centurion\\n\\n\r\nChi ha tan \u2013 Japanese themed school is great example how authors made fun out of themselves, this school is famous for charging towards enemies (clear reference) but unlike japanese soldiers those girls use tank guns instead of bayonets.\\n\\n\r\nBC free \u2013 Baguette themed school\\n\\n\r\nMaginot (Named after famous Maginot line),another Baguette\\n\\n\r\nThere  are some other schools that haven\u2019t appeared in the show but we can see them in spin-off mangas\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nSome characters (especially overall commanders) are representations of stereotypes of countries their school represents. Even Their names are sometimes made  from words or names those countries use. So we can see names like:\\n\\n\r\nKatyusha - overall commander of Pravda, can\u2019t say even a word in russian \\n\\n\r\nKlara - Half-russian\\n\\n\r\nDarjeeling \u2013 Named after a certain type of tea, she is the Leader of St. \\n\\n\r\nGloriana,very lady-like, always drinks tea and uses odd metaphores, (she is probably the most british character u can see in anime)\\n\\n\r\nKay -  okay this is the commander of Saunders\\n\\n\r\nErika - blond girl with blue eyes(typical arian maid), named after flower ,, heather\u201c (yes ,,Erika\u201c is ,,Heather\u201c),you really thought, they sing about some girl in that famous march song?\\n\\n\r\nMika \u2013 Finnish inspired character\\n\\n\r\nAnchovy - often refers herself as ,,Duce\u201c (duke) just like Mussolini did, she is the leader of Anzio\\n\\n\r\nTeam Hippo (Ooarai crew that operates Stug III)  contains  ,,History club\u201c members, and each of them Is an expert on specific part of History. We have Erwin (kinda obvious), Caesar (Obvious as well) Saemonza (named after certain samurai warrior) and Oryou (some famous japanese woman)\\n\\n\r\nSongs and OSTs:\\n\\n\r\nEven though opening and ending themes are barely connected to WWII, authors decided to use famous march songs as a background music for action scenes.So you can hear re-recorded and pretty cool versions of Panzerlied, Erika, British Grenadies,Yuki no Shigun and other famous march/folk songs from 1940s. And here comes another big reference when girls from Pravda (Soviet themed school, if you forgot) sing ,,Katyusha\u201c while rolling forward in bunch of T-34s IS-2 and KV-2. This is probably one of the most memorable scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAnother memorable references:\\n\\n\r\nWhile learning how to drive her tank Mako uses a book which looks just like Tigerfibel (German crew instruction manual made for panzer crews, those fiebels were less complicated than official manuals, they were illustrated kinda like comics and texts were made as ,,humorous\u201c poetry)\\n\\n\r\nBattle against Pravda is located in snowy area (Girls from History club said, that it reminds them of Stalingrad, what about you?)\\n\\n\r\nWhen Katyusha demands Ooarai's surrender,  Momo(Ooarai\u2019s student council vice-president) responds by saying \"nuts\". This is a reference to Anthony McAuliffe who in the Battle of the Bulge was encircled and demanded to surrender. In response he sent a note to the Germans with the solitary word \"nuts\".\\n\\n\r\nThe night before the Finals, the members of Rabbit team are seen watching \"Kelly's Heroes\".\\n\\n\r\nNow I will also talk a little about animation and physics. Tanks are amazingly detailed, you can really see that authors payed so much attention modelling them.  Please show me anime with better CGI tanks... Physics is however... Well even World of Tanks player would call it ,,arcade\u201c despite their detailed looks, tanks are moving incredibly fast, sometimes seems to have stronger armor then they should. And btw even though they use live ammo in the show, nobody gets hurt, when tank is \u201edestroyed\u201c, it simply raises white flag above and can\u2019t participate in match anymore, however after small maintenance you can use it again in next match. But to be fair, some physical aspects are amazing (tracks physics is amazing for example, especially in Das Finale).\\n\\n\r\nI know I know, this took longer than expected but I hope, that you now understand why does this show deserve 10/10. It\u2019s not for everyone but it does excellent job in terms of its spirit: A great WWII-themed show but with cute girls.\\n\\n\r\nOkay time to finish this. If you are into military or WWII (WWII especially) I don\u2019t believe you haven\u2019t watched it yet... If so, then wait no more, stop reading, close your web browser, LEGALLY OBTAIN  a copy of it and watch it... If you didn\u2019t like history classes this might not be your cup of Darjeeling tea... But you can give it a try anyways...\\n\\n\r\nIf you read it till here I am personally impressed and you have my respect.\\n\\n\r\nPS. More references are further described on gup.wikia\\n",

            "content": "Be honest, if you watch this, you're watching for the tanks and possibly the cute girls.\r\nI initially avoided this show based on the title alone (preview collections weren't something I was aware of at the time), thinking \"Great, another shallow moe show that will probably use cardboard characters and crummy plot.\" What I didn't expect when I watched one of my favorite YouTubers (\"The Mighty Jingles\") do a commentary on selected scenes was a fantastic soundtrack and ridiculously hilarious humor. \"All right, let's give this a try.\"\r\nSpoiler (sort of): Yeah, it's a shallow moe show with cardboard characters and a plot you'll largely not caremuch about. But it's funny!\\n\\n\r\nThe good news is that the cliched and one-dimensional characters are primarily minor characters, and there's about as many girls in this series as in Negima. Asking for all of them to be well-rounded and dynamic is an exercise in futility, and the show goes out of its way to have fun with the cliches. The characters can start out annoying at first (in particular the M3 crew), but they can grow on you (and in another review I've written, it's better than listening to 5-year-old girls be loud because they can). In the end Karina (the Rabbit team's driver) is one of my favorite girls (especially after the Monty Python sketch parody), and I have a custom decal based on the Rabbit team logo. The central five characters are a bit of a moe cliche party themselves, but their friendship nicely buoys the production and conveys the central theme of the show.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the plot is ridiculous. But that's the gag of the show, if you treat it like a long joke or a stand-up act, you'll find plenty of opportunities to laugh. If you get hung up on realism (as though that ever matters much in anime), you'll probably rip your hair out until you're bald.\\n\\n\r\nEven the tanks are funny. In real life, tanks don't drive around like race cars and have the potential to penetrate everything at point-blank range, nor are the crew compartments indestructible. But bowing to realism there would make a very different show, like Sora no Woto or Valkyria Chronicles. Aside from the first (exhibition) match, however, the tank tactics are surprisingly realistic-- Firing from higher ground is a double-edged sword, shooting into a tank's lower glacis armor is usually a great idea, etc. It seems that with the final episodes, the production staff realize that making the tank battle ridiculous as well is the trick, and we start to see tanks flipping over dramatically and a scrappy gang of smaller tanks defeat the heaviest tank in history.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the gems in this production is easily the soundtrack. Many of the teams in the show are themed after actual nations' tank battalions in World War II, and the music adopts marches (or in the case of the Soviet Union, a folk song) used by those nations. I loved the playful arrangement of British Grenadiers and a surprisingly accurate rendition of Sousa's Field Artillery March (I know, he arranged, not composed it, it's a good arrangement). But the Senshado March (or as I like to call it, the Ooarai Girls' High School fight song) is catchy and memorable, and the main melody is used liberally in different tempos and instruments depending on the mood; it even changes to minor key when the going gets really tough, and when the team is learning new things, it's arranged like a practice etude for a band. I just love it when a composer has fun with a theme like that. Dream Riser by Choucho is all right, and it's even better coupled with the opening animation. Enter Enter Mission... well, I guess that's a staple of moe anime.",

            "content": "If you're into moe girls and military hardware, this anime is a must-watch!\r\nIt holds up on its own, although you may not find it exceptional. The plot provides just enough character development to get you invested in the heroines, then switches to dynamic action sequences to produce tension.\r\nWhat makes this a true gem, however, is how realistically the tanks are portrayed (outside the odds of surviving a crippling hit if you're in one, that is). The tanks move like real tanks, not slow and ponderous like the stereotype but fast enough for Blitzkrieg. They shoot like real tanks, with hand-loaded shells, proper military sights, andrangefinding done with mental arithmetic involving the target's actual and apparent sizes. They even suffer from real-life limitations, such as engine malfunctions, bogging in rough/muddy terrain, track breakages, and lack of penetrating power affecting tactics on the fly. (Fuel and ammo limitations are also brought up, but never directly affect events.) The only unrealistic part would be the severe lack of efficiency in which the tanks are used, although the pilots can probably be excused for that, given that they're high schoolers. (Real-life tank battles are a lot less glamorous anyways, being mostly fought from a range of several hundred meters.)\\n\\n\r\nOf course, no anime is for everyone. If you don't find the combat scenes captivating, then you probably won't get much out the show as a whole. All developments outside of combat are aimed at making the combat more intense through personal investment in the characters; while this is a strong point for the show as a whole, it leaves the non-combat portions not substantial enough to be worthwhile on their own. Also, many of the background characters are one-dimensional, which some may find off-putting. (They form small groups of 3-6 which are *very* distinct from each other, each being the crew for a separate tank, though there's less variety among the members of each crew.)\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I'd give it an 8/10 - since it's kind of polarized between 10 and 6. If you've got any interest in military history and/or hardware (and moe, but come on... you're on an anime website) then you'll almost certainly enjoy this. If you have a friend who does, watch it with them and you may find it more interesting than you thought. Otherwise, it's still worth giving a shot, though it'll be hit-or-miss: there are much worse shows you could have wasted your time on.\\n\\n\r\nPanzer vor!",

            "content": "Hmm...moe...tanks? Wait, what? Such a thing actually exists? Yes. Yes, it actually does! Although, actually referring to the girls being moe and the tanks just being used, it still makes up for quite the combination!\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nTo most this will be brushed off as your generic \"high-school sports\" anime with something bad happening to the school/club if things end up the wrong (read: bad) way. And even though it could be considered generic, it's still likable and I personally liked it. \r\nThe sport however, is a unique one. Rather than the regular sports we know of nowadays, this one involves the use of tanks. And noworries, safety is assured! Well...90% of course. It's still a sport!\\n\\n\r\nThe teams fight against each others with tank teams and the rules are simple: Take down the Flagtank and it's over. It's as simple as it can get. However, strategy, as with almost eveything, is the key to success. And the way it's done is very close, if not actually accurate, to actual military warfare.\\n\\n\r\nTwo recap episodes are thrown in between, giving the viewer accurate and detailed information about what is actually involved and what is actually happening in our little world and who or what everyone likes/does. Will elaborate more on this part in the character part.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is enjoyable and doesn't have (as far as I could detect) flaws. What made me give the show a high score on art is it's splendid CG (Computer Graphics for those who are unfamiliar with the term), especially with the tanks. Whilst to some it may not seem that spectacular, it's still pretty amazing. \\n\\n\r\nWhat also intrigues me is the fact that, the actual animation (the characters) aren't mixed up into the CG as well. They might not pop up as much in the battles (as you'll mostly see only 1 person standing out of the tank), rather than doing the characters in 3D, they are blended/mixed superbly with the 3D. This makes their animation not \"too awkward\" for some people and still enjoyable to those who can be a little bit nit-picky on the details.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs tastes differ, I personally liked the OP and ED mainly because it's catchy and fits the \"moe\" theme of the anime. The anime as whole however, has well-fitting BGM (to those unfamiliar with the term: BackGroundMusic). Since the anime is conneted with tank warfare, it contains tons of \"army-ish\" background music. This gives you (at least, it did to me) a feeling of true military involvement. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's not actually it. Even the respective nations receive their respective themes! The English have an elegant and noble sound, while the Americans have an active and cheerful (military) \"parade-ish\" play. The Germans have a respectable, \"strict\" soundtrack that slightly resembles them. And the Russians, they have their usual, quick-paced music. Do note that the German one is primarily focused on it's strictness and cleanness and not because the people are from Germany! The execution of giving the show a \"military taste\" sound is what makes them score high on my list.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as a side-note in the sound department: Becareful with headphones/ear plugs. They have done an overwhelming (maybe a little bit too good) job with gun fires. This may result in possible, very loud explosions/cannon fires which could possibly harm your ears (and possible enjoyment) if your volume is on the high side. This did not make me lower a point in sound as it has only such an effect if your volume is high enough to make the sound overwhelm everything.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters each and all have their own uniqueness (or quirks). The MC is quite the shy-type but can be very confident at times. She is accompanied by a delicate (who wanted to add some punch to her life) lady, a love/boys obsessed girl, a tank-obsessed loner and the \"I hate early mornings\" yet very smart fellow teammate!\\n\\n\r\nThey each have their own problems. And while this is a generic something to happen when a group of people have to overcome something in an anime, it gives the viewer good enough information to understand why everyone is the way they are.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there are also the other groups since it's not just one tank per school: The Students Council, The history lovers, the 1st year class and many more. Though they don't gain as much development as the main part of the whole team, the recap episodes include information of each of them. This makes sure that we, as a viewer, won't be left with too many things to think about.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I won't go in too much details regarding the enemies, they each resemble quite the \"stereotype\" of each of their respective countries. Again, do note that the German \"stereotype\" isn't because they are from Germany but rather the strictness and cleanness theme/characteristics from the Germans.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I'm very fond of the interactions between the characters as well as the chemistry with all of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs a person without expectation, I personally enjoyed this anime a lot. Considering the fact that it uses tank warfare as a sport made it, at least to me, unique compared to other sports oriented anime. The involvement of the tanks (especially the information about each tank in the recap episodes) made me enjoy military part more than I actually would have if I didn't recieve the knowledge about them and if the anime didn't casted actual importance on them. It actually gives the viewer a better understanding on why this anime is based on tanks as well as general information about tanks as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like moe stuff with quite some action, this anime could possibly fill you with enjoyment and I'll encourage you to pick this up and hope you'll enjoy it too!",

            "content": "If I were to do a poll right now, I would be very certain that 65-80% who watched this show have played or have started playing World of Tanks/War Thunder. Am I right or am I right? Of course, I'm right. Right? \r\n[Story]: (7/10)\r\nMiho Nishozumi, who hates operating tanks gets drafted by the student council to join the \"tankery\" club. Along with her friends and the tank (Panzer IV) she's operating, she leads the crew to glory and victory.\r\nI've known this anime for quite a long time now. Way before your grandma was even alive. Ok, I'm going to stop with the jokes. I haveknown this show way before I started watching anime. I discovered the show while searching for WoT (World of Tanks) videos and that was about......2 years ago. I hated anime at that time but I don't want to get into that. Now that I have changed my opinions on anime and started watching more anime, I wanted to start GuP as soon as possible because my friends recommended it to me and they know I'm a huge tank nerd. There's a reason why I didn't watch the show when my friend recommended it to me and I'll state the reason on the Animations category. Let's get to the review shall we?\\n\\n\r\nI just want to get this out of the way first. If you're looking for a show with a \"2edgyforme\" plot or a great plot in general then you need to get out now because this is not the show for you. The plot is not the reason why I love the show. GuP shows that even if the show has a decent/mediocre story, it can still be enjoyed by the fans. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the show has a rather ridiculous but simple plot.  Miho gets recruited in a tankery club, she decides whether to join or not, and then they get on tank battles with other schools. Why is it ridiculous? For God's sake, their schools are in a giant-sized Aircraft Carrier and it also has a mini city. In other words, they live in an Aircraft Carrier. Want more examples? Tank Battles are a sport...being operated by high school girls...\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, I now want to focus on the Tank Battles which is the main purpose of the show. As a WW2 Tank nerd and a tank enthusiast, the battle scenes made me cringe....but in a good way. This shouldn't be a surprise but I enjoyed the tank battles way more than the slice-of-life scenes and who wouldn't? The tank battles are simply amazing and it's not just some dull boring tank battles. It's accompanied with Miho's clever strategies. Hearing her strategies and how she and her crew executes them adds suspense to the already-suspenseful Tank Battles. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I want to point out is how the Tank Battles really goes in GuP. What you have here is an underpowered and weak tank team (in this case, the Oorai Academy) going against a trained, experienced tank team that heavily outnumbers them. Not only that but the opponent's tanks are way stronger than Oorai Academy's tanks. So how do they deal with the situation and how do they defeat the opponents? Do they pull a deux-ex machina? Do they pull some kind of powers right out of their ass? No and no. It's all because of Miho's smart and clever strategies. She keeps calm-headed and she actually thinks how to deal with the situation going on around her. Seriously, this girl's got some great leadership. I can't give all the credit to Miho, however. If you're team has great leadership and all the team members work together to overcome the impossible situation then you have yourself an undefeatable team. So some of the credit goes to Miho's team member for executing her plans perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nOh right, I forgot to explain why the tank battles made me cringe.....in a good way. I'm going to provide one example from one of the battle scenes and it's the scene where the Churchill and Matilda tanks chasing the Panzer IV. I can tell you right now that a Churchill and a Matilda CANNOT catch up to a Panzer IV. It's completely impossible. Why do you think both tanks have tough frontal and sides armor? They're not supposed to go that fast. Then again, they live in a mini city in an Aircraft Carrier so I shouldn't really complain about the tank's inaccuracy. If you don't know shit about tanks and how they work then it's easy for you to ignore the tank's inaccuracies. Another ridiculous battle scene is the final tank battle between a Panzer IV (H) and a Panzer VI Tiger. I think it's best for you guys to see it for yourself rather than reading it in my review on how it goes. There's more where that came from but I'll only provide two examples.\\n\\n\r\nI like what GuP did here... Every opponent the girl's school faces (The Ooarai High School Academy) are personifications of a real life nation that fought in WW2. These nations are Great Britain, Germany, Italy (cut from the show and was instead, shown in OVA), Russia and of course, the United States. So basically, it's like a group of mixed nations vs one nation. The girls in that said school also resembled said countries. For example, the Great Britain themed-high school has girls who are British, dressed in fashionable manner and drank tea, the American themed-high school has girls who are very enthusiastic and has a personality that shouts \" 'Murica Baby!!\" that you see in some American people this days or the Russian themed-high school has girls who are aggressive, charged into the battlefield and did not care if they die which actually happened in WW2. I love how they also sang the \"Katyusha\" Russian Folk Song in a heavy Japanese accent which made it comically bad. At least, they tried. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nTime to explain why I didn't watch the show until now. I have four words. Moe-styled character designs. When I first looked at the cover, I was put off by the character design..I thought this was going to be another moe-bait anime show with full of fanservice and tittie flashes. Thank god, that's not the case. Yes, there are fanservices in the show but there are only a few of them and like I said above...the main purpose of the show are the tank battles and the fanservice did not get in the way. \\n\\n\r\nGuP's tank battles and CGi tank designs are phenomenal. Firstly, the tank battles are smooth for the most part but you can spot some choppiness and the tank battles made it obvious that the show is running at 24 FPS (frames per sec). Secondly, The CGi tank designs are great. It's obvious that there are a lot of work put into designing the tanks. There are also attention to details and I'm glad they got the gun caliber of the tanks right so I can tell what guns they were using like the Sherman Firefly's 17 Pounder Gun, the IS-2's 120MM gun, or the KV-2's monster 152MM gun. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9.8/10)\\n\r\nI have no words......for the show's soundtrack department. It's simply OUTSTANDING. I'm not talking about the OST's or the battle theme. Those were just bonuses to me. I'm talking about the tank engine sounds, the gun sounds and the tank track's sound. I really want to ask the director or the creators of the show if they actually recorded an actual real-life tank firing or if they recorded a real-life tank moving. It sounds so realistic and that 152MM gun sound on a KV-2 is a f*cking monster. That gun is scary as hell and I'm glad they gave the KV-2 a proper scary-ass gun sound.\\n\\n\r\nI was watching this show using my headphones with high-quality bass and it f*cking killed my ears because of how realistic and loud the gun fire sounds. It's worth it though and I would definitely sacrifice my ears again because I would be watching the movie with the same headphones. Now the OP and ED theme songs. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Dreamriser\" by Choucho and the ED theme song is \"Enter Enter MISSION\" by Miho Nishizumi, Saori Takebe, Hana Isuzu, Yukari Akiyama, and Mako Reizei. The OP theme song is actually the second reason why I started watching the show. It came up on my recommendations list, I listened to it, and I thought it was good. The ED theme song is pretty decent but not that great. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the show in English Dub so I'll be reviewing the English VA. I am telling you right now that you do not want to watch the English Dub of the show. It is terrible and this is coming from a guy who watches most of his anime in English Dub. Hearing the Dub version of the show makes me want to grab my shoe laces and strangle myself until I pass out. Most of the characters sounded monotonic and it sounds like they didn't even try at all. Did they ever do retakes? What the hell were they thinking?! I wish FUNimation or Aniplex would have dubbed the series instead of that crappy Sentai Filmworks dubbing company. Luckily, I watched it again in subbed version. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (7.5/10)\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the characters aren't all that great but they're not bad either. I mean, I don't even know half of the cast's name. I only know the name of Miho's crew. In other words, I only know 5 of the main character's name. What does that tell you? That's right, the show focused way too much time on the main characters and didn't really focus too much on the supporting characters which were all part of the Oorai Academy. I would have wished they could have also gotten more screentime but considering that this is only 12 episodes, I don't blame them for only focusing on the main the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe character's personalities are plainly obvious like Yukari's \"nerdy\" personality, Mako's \"anti-social\" personality, Takebe's \"energetic\" personality, and last but not least Miho's \"something happened in her past so that's why she's acting like that\" personality. I've seen these kinds of personalities before...for like the millionth time. Whatever, I like Yukari's personality because I have the same personality as her. Like her, I'm also a tank nerd.   \\n\\n\r\nThe only character I saw who developed is Miho and her character development is pretty decent. In the first half of the show, she's a shy girl who had a terrible past and because of her past, she didn't want to join the tankery club. In the latter half of the series, we see her overcome that past. I think that's pretty much it. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe first 2 episodes were boring and I planned to drop the series. By the 3rd episode, the show finally got into the tank battles and I've been hooked ever since. I also marathoned the series and finished it in 2 days. The story and character may be simple and generic but that doesn't stop me from enjoying the show to fullest. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Girls und Panzer\" is a light-hearted anime packed with great tank-battles that shouldn't be taken seriously. If you just sit back and watch the show instead of criticizing every second of the show then the chances of you enjoying the show is very high. Also, don't get fooled by the cover because this anime is not about girls, girls, and girls. It's about girls, tanks, and tanks. If you're looking for an anime packed with tank-battle action then this is the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.8/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Decent Storyline\\n\r\n+Great Visuals and Animation/Stunning CGi Tanks\\n\r\n+Outstanding Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Tank gun sounds, engine sounds, tank track sounds sounds almost realistic\\n\r\n+Good Character Dynamics when they're all in a tank\\n\r\n+Miho's smart and clever strategies\\n\r\n+Tank Battles are phenomenal\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Slice-of-life moments are somewhat boring\\n\r\n-\"The Battle of Anzio\" was cut and shown as OVA instead\\n\r\n-Tank Battles may be great but does not last for over 2 episodes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "A IMP Review of: Girls und Panzer (Dubbed edition)\r\n(IMP stands for \u201cIn My Prospective\u201d, meaning if someone attempts to correct the way i see the show i have no intention of reading any \u201ccorrections\u201d)\r\nStory: Ladies and gentlemen do you like tanks? Do you like Girls? Do you like Girls going to school to learn all about the basics of tanks so they can fight other girls in tanks from other schools while they mostly all live on aircraft carriers? Well this show has all that stuff, plus acheesy feel good storyline. Sense my favorite types of anime are Slice of Life, Fantasy, and Military I have high biases towards this show, but because the cheesy feel good ending but because of the base facts about tanks and tank warfare.  For the story I can\u2019t give it anything to great because it\u2019s been done before and it gets cheesy, so 6/10. Basic rundown, girl in tankery family fails, she goes to and school without tankery, school wants to do tankery, she agrees because  new friends tried to help her to be a part of tankery, they get ready for tankery TUUUUUUURNMENT ARC and use MC status to help them. Nothing to special, but because there\u2019s no ACTUAL category for the other info in the show I\u2019m going to make one.\\n\\n\r\nRealism: This is a special category for this show because the true realism lies in how the tanks are operated. Some may say that having tank warfare would lead to death so that\u2019s not realistic but that\u2019s where the anime/cartoon aspect of the show kicks in to help things work out so I\u2019d say it\u2019s not relevant to why I made this category. Throughout the show we are told how a tanks basic operation works, it requires usually a 4/5 person team to operate a tank. The gunner, the radioman, the driver, and the navigator. Depending on what tank you have it could require or fit more people or less people. How many shows do you know of that aren\u2019t documentaries that would teach you something like that, ESPCIALLY anime shows?! Along with that the 3D tanks do a good job of showing how a realistic tank could and or would move throughout a battlefield or town. They also talk a small bit about using terrain to your advantage, tank maintenance, and a few other facts about certain tanks. Which I can\u2019t give anything less than a 10/10 for, (this score won\u2019t affect the story score but will affect the overall score).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This category is rather tricky because we have a large variety of characters dude to how many drive each tank, however most of these characters get very little screen time and most of them just cheerily and chessily follow along with the MC regardless of how everything goes down. One has to take into account this show is part slice of life if not mostly slice of life so I\u2019ll give the characters a 7/10 out of grace, I mean the main cast is kinda bland, we get some character development from some of them but it\u2019s not enough to save them from their bland ways, hell the ship girls from Kantai collection had more personality. Because of some comedy between the characters, some characters being fun and the small amount of character development they were saved from a 6/10 but just barely, (the show in my opinion is more about the tank fights). \\n\\n\r\nArt: Let\u2019s get elephant out of the room now; the 3D on the tanks isn\u2019t something a lot of people don\u2019t like. I personality  had no issue with it, on top of the fact that the 3D helped to show how the tanks actually move in reality, so even though I\u2019m not always a fan of 3D either, 3D haters can go suck it here. The rest of the non 3D were in no way unappealing to the eyes but they also did nothing to unique, 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: In most of the reviews I\u2019ve done thus far, sound has mostly been very low on my give a shit list, but those changes here! Not because of the opening or the ending songs, (I wasn\u2019t a fan) be because of the background soundtrack. I loved here the light hearted and sometimes intense military-esk music in the background of this show, it added to the show as a whole either during the battle scenes or sometimes during the normal slice of life as well, 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10. Let me be frank, the only reason I really disliked the show was because it was EXTREMELY! Cheesy. I wish the \u201cgood guys win because we do\u201d trope wasn\u2019t so apparent throughout the show, if there were more challenges to overcome then just trying to find decommissioned tanks then the show would have been so much better. If you start out in a school that is new, you shouldn\u2019t already be beating top schools, you should be working your way up the chain until you get to the final boss, and then possibly lose. Because it\u2019s through failure that people learn. But I had no issues with the slice of life stuff, the tankery stuff was amazing, and the characters though bland were fun to watch so I enjoyed myself a lot, I just would prefer less cheese with my tank girls. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I\u2019m sure people would be confused as to why I\u2019m gonna give this show a 9/10 with the issues it has, but ultimately it\u2019s because of the aspects of the show being good, just honestly there needs to be more character development, less cheesiness and MORE TANK BATTLES! Then it would be a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nLet me tell others 2 things, 1: I will not tell you or encourage you to give the same rating, this is just my personal opinion on this show and 2: honestly I\u2019m doing this review and other reviews as a hobby and for my own \u201canime records\u201d so to speak, so if you see this and don\u2019t like it just ignore it honestly because its more for me then to help others in the long run.\\n",

            "content": "After the birth of Lucky Star and K-ON!, the mo\u00e9 genre has invaded every major genre to date. But, it has mostly focused on the slice-of-life shows. And even though it's still popular, it was only a matter of time until the anime community began to need something new.\r\nAnd in 2012, along came Studio Actas and made the anime adaptation of Girls und Panzer. And unfortunately, many people brushed it off as another cheesy mo\u00e9 show, even though the series is bloody amazing.\r\nSTORY\r\nGirls und Panzer is about exactly what it sounds like. Girls piloting war tanks.\r\nMiho is a student who was a member of anelite tankery-based school. An incident in a championship forced her to leave and transfer to a different school with no \"Tankwondo\" program. However when the student council catches wind of her history, they force her to join the re-introduced program, to save their school from being shut down.\\n\r\nAs a setting it isn't that awesome, it's simple and effective to get the anime on a rolling start.\\n\r\nThe school then signs up to the championship, and the characters learn to pilot tanks.\\n\r\nAn intersting thing is that the towns and schools of opposing teams are located on giant ships! It is somewhat explained, but it still leaves a feeling of \"why the hell not?\" It isn't a problem, as it gives the show some strange variety.\\n\r\nSo we are shown how tanks are piloted, given accurate information about many historical tanks, and so on...\\n\r\nOf course, it's the battles that make the show so gripping, with proper military tactics, absolutely ridiculous manouvres, and of course, the opposing teams.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThis is my favourite part of the show, as the giant cast of characters brings lots of humour in, and I'm not just talking about the opposition!\\n\r\nWe have the main group of friends, the Student Council, the disciplinary comittee, the disbanded volleyball club, the first year group, the motor club, the online gamers, and my personal favourite, the history nerds. They bring with them lots of references to historical battles, including the famous \"NUTS!!!\" reply from the American Gen. McAuliffe when given the option to surrender in Belgium, in 1945. Also, keep an eye out for Bon Jovi lyrics.\\n\r\nOf course, this wouldn't be a Girls und Panzer review, if I didn't mention the opposing teams. I'm pretty sure that they are the main reason for this anime's popularity. Basically, if you want international stereotypes, look for Hetalia. If you want international stereotypes, that are so casual to the point that they're ridiculous, watch this show. Every highschool that competes in this show and in the original material, has a \"theme\" of a different country, from during the WWII before-and-after period. To summarise;\\n\r\nWe have the British: posh, proud and always fight with chivalry, tea and elegance.\\n\r\nThe Americans: loud, energetic and cheat to win.\\n\r\nThe Russians: violent, and use the winter weather to their advantage. Also, casual placement of the Soviet hammer and sickle on their tanks. (A bit deformed to prevent confusion, obviously.)\\n\r\nWe also have Black Forest, which are Japanese, but pilot German tanks which have the Iron Cross painted on, so I'm sure we all know who they represent.\\n\r\nFinally, we have the Italians... Pasta. That's it. However, they have a full separate 35minute episode to themselves (which you need to find separately), and you kinda need to stop episode 7 just before the end to avoid any spoilers. (Stop after the bath scene if anyone asks.) Also, if you do watch this separate episode, DO NOT watch that part after the credits, at all costs.\\n\r\nAnyway, what strikes me as seriously brave, is the inclusion of the Soviet symbols, the Iron Cross and the fact that the Italian team call their commander \"Il Duce\". (Google it if you don't know who that was) To be honest, the first time I watched this anime I was hoping that they wouldn't include the swastika. Either way, I'm still surprised how the creators didn't get into trouble as a result.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\n90% of the soundtrack consists of marches and other military band compositions. They fit the show to a tee, but unfortunately many of them sound identical, by using one musical idea in several tracks. It isn't a bad idea, it just didn't work that well. The opening and ending themes are completely average, and forgettable.\\n\r\nThe best parts of the soundtrack are the themes of each school team. Every team has one or two songs of their country theme. These are played when the specific team comes into the spotlight and begin to attack.\\n\r\n\"The British Grenadiers\" for the British,\\n\r\n\"Funiculi Funicul\u00e0\" for the Italians,\\n\r\n\"Blood on The Risers\" and \"Field Artillery March\" for the American team,\\n\r\n\"Kat'yusha\" and \"Polyushko Polye\" for the Russian team,\\n\r\n\"Panzerlied\" and \"Erika\" for the German team.\\n\r\nI watched the subbed version only, I will eventually watch it all in English when the film gets a dub. I think the English version has been edited slightly, since the most memorable scene was cut out of the dub due to copyright issues. The sub also has more humour than usual, which is surprising.\\n\r\nSpecial mention to Sumire Uesaka and Hisako Kanemoro who voiced Nonna and Katyusha who both sang the ever-so-popular old war song \"Katyusha\" in Russian, with almost-perfect pronounciation.\\n\r\nOne other thing I must mention in terms of sound are the actual sound effects, and in particular, the tank guns and explosions. I was glad to see that the creators didn't take the easy way out and have just one explosion sound for every tank... Also, very loud.\\n\r\nThe anime was made by Studio Actas. Not a studio I've heard of before. The character animation is fine, but the best animation in my opinion is seen in the amount of detail that's put into the tanks and their realistic (albeit sometimes very exaggerated) movements. The tanks are very accurately made, and lots of information is given on nearly every tank, which is a very nice touch.\\n\r\nI'm not the biggest fan of 3D CGI in anime, as sometimes it feels out of place. In this anime though, it is perfect. The tank battles feel more action-packed and real with the three-dimensional movement.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL EVALUATION\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer is one of those shows that you should watch, just for the hell of it. Does the anime make any sense? No. Does it matter? No. It is hilarious at times, especially due to the characters' dialogues mid-battle, like the Student Council members mocking each other for missing a shot, and also due to the obvious stereotypes. Definitely worth watching if you are in need of something fun. You will probably end up facepalming at the common ridiculousness the show has to offer, but at least it isn't bad...\\n\r\nThere are specials and OVAs that can be avoided, but I recommend watching everything, just to understand the world in which the anime is set in. There are 2 episodes through the course of the 12 episodes that basically do a recap, but they actually go into great detail concerning every single tank that was shown onscreen. Do not skip them, they are really interesting. \\n\r\nI have also watched the movie, and a review will be coming soon...\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\n~thobiazz~\\n\\n\r\nPANZER VOR!!!",

            "content": "Girls Und Panzer might have the strangest variety of genres of anime I've ever seen. I'd call it a CGDCT with action and sports, but right now that may seem like a very odd combination.\r\nGUP tells the story of Miho Nishizumi, a girl who, due to having come from a family with a history of excellence in the field, is forced to join her school's Tankery team or face expulsion. Tankery, if its name hadn't given it away, is the competition between two teams involving tanks (World War 2 era tanks, to be specific) to eliminate the other in a firefight. Obviously, since this isn'tan actual war, the rounds used by the tanks simply immobilise, rather than obliterate. Nishizumi does find herself to be lucky, as despite having had no prior training or experience, does manage to be an excellent tank commander, leading her team to victory in many cases. While Nishizumi certainly takes centre-stage, her whole tank squad (consisting of a commander, driver, radio operator, gunner and loader) could arguably be the pentagonists of the show, as each of them sees about as much screentime as Nishizumi. Whilst these characters all have vibrant personalities, they are ultimately, not greatly interesting, and the viewer probably wouldn't be rooting for them if not for the fact they weren't the main characters, but they aren't exactly boring either. The characters who are much more interesting are the opponents of the main characters. These characters are all very much based upon stereotypes, such as the British team which is very refined and orderly (as is their battle formation), and will drink tea at any given opportunity and whose members are all named after tea, or the Russian team, which has little leadership beyond a small petulant child with similar leading abilities to Joseph Stalin (who is also as happy to send people to the gulag as he was), and uses the weather to their advantage. It is a shame that the main characters have little characterisation , especially since all the other schools have so little screentime after each episode wherein they have a battle, and despite a clear advantage, and initially doing much better, eventually coming to lose, and, while every episode plays like this and you can usually see it coming (it is a sports anime) after all, it still manages to remain exciting throughout, and all of the episodes feel rather fulfilling.\\n\r\nWhen I first watched GUP I thought it was just a bit decent. Another CGDCT but with a gimmick, this one being tanks, but that was because I myself at that time did not care much for tanks, the second World War, or military history in general, a position that I've now changed. Upon rewatching now being able to identify the tanks myself, as well as the omnipresent historical references throughout (and I do mean omnipresent, 5 minutes do not pass without a reference to the war, or a famous film depicting it. Even the birthdays of the characters are historical references.)\\n\r\nA sequel, named Girls Und Panzer Der Film was later released, and is essentially an extension of the episodic show, and of equal quality, which isn't a bad thing, but I do think that a 2 hour film seems to run far better than 25 minute episodes. A second film, titled GUP Das Finale has been released, and as of now, is currently on an unresolved cliffhanger, which while cleverly implemented via its subversion of both the characters' expectations as well as the viewer's, I think really was not a good spot to end a film wherein one has to wait several years for a sequel. Last-minute budgetary constraints are my guess. In any case, I eagerly anticipate Das Finale Part 2, even if it's not really a finale if they have to make a part two.\\n\r\nFinally, a 6 episode OVA series, Yukari Akiyama's Tank Corner, is quite possibly the best OVA series I think I've come across. In it, the character Yukari, who is essentially a Rule 63 of every tank autist, enthusiastically details and compares many of the tanks in the show, and all in all it's very well researched and enjoyable, my only complaint being that she said the T-34 was one of the best tanks of the war, which evidently was the only research blunder that was made.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, GUP is a good anime. It gets everything it needs to right. The character interactions are enjoyable, the action is intense, and the music choice is strong and keeps the blood pumping, and there is something rather special about listening to the characters all sing patriotic WW2-era songs of their country. It's not revolutionary, but it's a lot of fun. If you dismiss it as 'just another moeblob SoL', you're going to miss out.",

            "content": "I will start by saying that I don't like moe anime, but tend to get sucked into all female shows with ridiculously specific genres that have moe elements like K-on, Saki, Strike Witches, Kan-Colle, etc etc.  But when my friend recommended this to me, I laughed.  I wasn't going to watch a show about moe high school girls driving tanks!  And then I proceeded to watch the anime, and then watched it again three more times.  \r\nGirls und Panzer has more fanservice for the tanks than the for girls, which in turn makes it more interesting and enjoyable for those ofus who don't get turned on by animated high schoolers.  It has an interesting blend of 3D and 2D animation that was utilized quite effectively, and the characters on screen make you laugh. \\n\r\nThe music is very patriotic, but overall fits into the military sport theme.  The animators did a great job using the tanks to create interesting camera angles that pan with the turret or go up and down to mimic the tank rolling over uneven surfaces.  \\n\r\nAgain since I tend to watch a lot of shows that have big casts (like Kan-Colle) I think Girls und Panzer does an excellent job of introducing all the characters, and even make you care about them.  Sure, they may be stereotypical and can be found in any comedy anime, but I enjoyed the gradual introduction to the different teams.  Compare this to Kan-Colle, which is aimed directly at fans of the game and therefore doesn't provide much introduction to the different classes for viewers, and High School Fleet which after just watching this afternoon I'm struggling to remember the main characters name. \\n\r\nOverall, if you have watched K-On or Saki or Strike Witches and had a good time, you might like a slightly more niche anime like Girls und Panzer.  No, it's not realistic, and yes it has cute high school girls driving tanks all mysteriously wearing skirts that never get blown in the breeze and expose panties, but in the end it was a good laugh.",

Even though it has all the moe stuff to it, It was actually kinda educational.\r\nIt was also enjoyable watching the school battles.\r\nThough it must have been set in a harem world, since there is a lack of Male presences. So I was kinda suprised there wasn't a male in there somewhere, Like in Upotte.\r\nI loved some of the ideas and concepts of mobile nations or school nations.\r\nBut after the first few introductory lessons, the rest was mainly just moe and battles.The battles were interesting, tactics were interesting. it ended on quite the cheesy note. but its was enjoyable, I probably enjoyed the battles more then the actual characters though.\\n\\n\r\nBut still it was enjoyable. I would recommend watching in one sitting, since its short. and you can enjoy it more that way.",

            "content": "I honestly did not know what score to give to this anime. It was cute, fun, and had lots of action. The story got right to the point, stuck with the plot, and it was over in 12 episodes. I really enjoyed this anime, but at the same time, it wasn't the best I've seen by far. This is the perfect show to watch watch while looking for another anime to replace the amazing series you've just finished! And it's also the perfect show to watch when you really don't feel like doing anything at all, but need something to take up your time ;D\r\nStory- I'll give it a 7. It was a good story. Not too dramatic or complicated, and it was executed nicely. Once again, it's not the best show I've seen, but it was truly, and honestly \"good\".\\n\\n\r\nArt - I'll give it a 9. Everything was drawn well, just like most anime series out today. The tanks, the ship, the town, the school, the people....everything was drawn very, very well. IT was your typical anime art - nothing too special, but still really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound - I'll give it a 9. There wasn't anything out of the ordinary about the sound. The effects were great, and the music was cool. It was your average anime. However, that is one thing that annoys me. Most voices of the female students were the same high pitched, whinny sounding voices that you hear in most \"cute girl cast\" anime. It's annoying, and I seriously want to give sound an 8 because of it, but all of the voices weren't like that, so it's fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - I'll give this an 8. The characters are the same characters you see in many similar anime. You don't get to know them as well as you'd like, because the plot moves pretty quickly......however, many of the characters are so similar to others out there, that you don't feel like you're missing anything.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I don't know.....I'll go on and give it a 8. If I was looking for an anime to really impress me, I would so bump this score down to a 7, however. This show was cool. It was a nice snack while I'm searching for a better show to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - I give this anime an 8. It was very good. I recommend it to those that just need something, anything to watch. I recommend it to those that like cute anime. I recommend this to those that like all girl casts, and/or girls doing things you'd think guys would do....this is more of a cute, \"girl power\" type anime than anything, so if that's what you're into, you'll love this show....otherwise, it will simply be just another good, or maybe even another really good show to you.\\n\\n\r\n:l    :)    ;D    :D    :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "(THIS REVIEW HAS A FEW SPOILERS)\r\nOver the years there have been various hybrid series putting cute girls into situations you wouldn\u2019t normally see (Gakkougurashi! comes to mind). Some of these series manage to pull off the interesting contrast and others fall short. Now we have high school girls doing moe things while driving around in tanks. How does this fare as a series? Well, as you can see by my rating, not particularly well, in my opinion. Read on, and I'll tell you why. \r\nThe story here is pretty simple. Various schools from around the area take part in the influential sport of \u2018tankwondo,\u2019 whichinvolves two teams going at it in tank warfare to show which school can come out on top. Our main character, Nishizumi Miho, has just entered into a new school that doesn\u2019t have this sport, but lo and behold, they decide to bring it back right as she arrives. The student council wants Miho to join due to her family\u2019s excellent track record with strategic command in tank battles, but she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with it any more. When she tries to turn them down with the support of her new friends, the student council president threatens to kick her out of school. She replies with, \u201cTank battles it is then, I didn\u2019t want to join the tea ceremony club anyways!\u201d (I paraphrased that last part) From here, it\u2019s all about coming together with her new group of friends and winning the tankwondo championship for the school. So, what we have is an underdog story with the focus on friendship and teamwork. It\u2019s a style that\u2019s been done to death, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be used well. While the aforementioned theme works well enough in this series, it\u2019s hindered by various other things, a few major issues in particular. \\n\\n\r\nThe first issue to discuss is the mood of the series. I know that this series is meant to be goofy and fun, with the contrast of young girls operating large war machines emphasizing this. However, they also try to insert serious moments and themes that don\u2019t work well, such as the school closing down if their team can\u2019t manage to win the championship. The problem here is they take forever to even mention it, which creates pointless drama. Then there\u2019s the main antagonist group, the final team, which happens to have Miho\u2019s older sister in it. They challenge each other, but Miho will have to win against the other schools first. What\u2019s the problem here? There\u2019s no tension whatsoever. You already KNOW they\u2019ll make it to the finals, the battles themselves don\u2019t have many gripping moments or cliffhangers and, because of the goofy mood, the \u201cWe have to win no matter what!\u201d moments fall flat. Not to mention, there\u2019s no tense background music to provide a more stressful atmosphere for these encounters. It keeps playing the same silly tunes, for the most part, so you\u2019re left unsure of how you should feel.\\n\\n\r\nThe other issue worth bringing up involves contradictions popping up. \u201cWe have our knowledge that the school will close if we don\u2019t give it our all, so let\u2019s do our best!\u201d All right, then why are you getting out of your tank during a battle to thank someone for help, when you could easily and just as sincerely do it over the radio like the other teams? Why was a new team of girls seemingly not trained at all for an extremely important final battle? Why was the final battle between the sisters declared a solo match among themselves but, when the enemy team came to assist, the older sister didn\u2019t call them off? Why are certain harsh and spiteful opponents automatically friendly after a loss? Why are they allowed to fight in town and destroy it? Even if they get reimbursed, why don\u2019t the townspeople feel it\u2019s an inconvenience? Why were two characters disowned from their families for ridiculous reasons involving tankwondo, then suddenly accepted again without any kind of development? Things like this just don\u2019t make much sense to me. \\n\\n\r\nNow, how about some GOOD things? The main characters are pretty likable, even a few secondary ones. Their kind relationship with each other is nice to see, and they get developed enough to make you care about each of them. Despite having a huge cast, I don\u2019t feel it detracts from anything here. The tank battles, while being mostly uninteresting, do have some good bits of strategy, particularly during the last fight. The overall art is nice to look at, and the tanks are also extremely well modeled and animated. Aside from the lackluster normal soundtrack, the opening and ending songs are catchy and nice to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to like this series; in fact I usually enjoy quirky stuff like this. Unfortunately, the problems detracted from my overall experience. You could make the argument that tank battles aren\u2019t really my thing, and I\u2019m not into sports very much in general. Yet I\u2019m a huge fan of Prince of Tennis and Kuroko no Basket. In the end, it comes down to writing and presentation, and Girls und Panzer fell short in both areas for me. \\n",

            "content": "I'll be honest, I normally pass over shows that look like they'll be solely about moe and \"cute girls doing cute things\" - it does little but serve to annoy me by saturating me with girly cuteness, and my ratings reflect that. Not even the promise of tanks (which, like every other red-blooded American male, I'd fall head over heels for) could get me to watch this. It took a surprise endorsement from another who had similar initial impressions as me (no name dropping, but you know who you are) to get me to watch this. \r\n 12 episodes later, I have to say Iwas fairly satisfied. Rather than being a platform to simply showcase different models of tanks surrounded by moe tank otaku-bait, I actually got an exciting series of tank battles, the kind that actually kept me on the edge of my seat. The slice-of-life and moe moments were easily the weakest parts of the show for me, but mercifully those became few and far between as the necessary character development of the first half was done. I still don't know why they thought it was necessary to have the girls freak out over a squirrel in the middle of a winter battle with the Russians, but I digress. \\n\\n\r\n The battles were well-executed and fast-paced (as I said, I was actually leaning into the monitor to see what kind of trick they were going to pull off and inevitably win the match); I actually felt like they were using tactics to win matches, rather than special moves that come out of nowhere (coughEyeshield 21cough). It was accompanied by a very fitting soundtrack; there wasn't a huge variety, but all the tracks, especially the track Panzer Vor, had this very childlike and whimsical military march quality to it - I was fondly reminded of my Boy Scout days. The CG tanks were surprisingly well integrated into the animation, and only the hyper-smoothness of the lines and the lighting gave it away. \\n\\n\r\n My only complaint is that the characters are very flat (not like that!) - I honestly do not remember the name of anyone besides Maho (who I personally found a little too weak for my taste, but whatever), and characters were constantly added but left unused for much. As a side-note, I had to calm myself down whenever I saw someone stick their head out of a tank without their damn helmet on. \\n\\n\r\n All in all, I don't regret watching Girls und Panzer. I was pleasantly surprised by this series, and I proudly award it a 8 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\n PANZER VOR!",

Dedicated and well educated high school girls working, fixing and using tanks is psychologically positive specially to motivate the STEM education in girls.  The only think it didn't like me was some scenes that were exaggerated even for such sub-realistic anime. But in generalI consider this anime excellent!!!!.\\n",

            "content": "Ah, the good cute Girls Und Panzer. (Warning, I haven't watched this anime for about a year so forgive me if I forget a name or something.)\r\n      This story takes place in a city on a giant ship. Amazing, eh? The exact year is not mentioned, but it's sometime after WW2 because they use tanks. LOTS of them. Of course, that's the whole point of the anime; sexy girls fighting each other in tanks. \r\n      The protagonist and also captain of the Anglerfish Team of Ooarai Girls High School, Miho Nishizumi, is seeking for victoryin the tank championship because she was accused of last year's failure of her team. \\n\\n\r\n                    Characters:\\n\r\n                    (Anglerfish)\\n\\n\r\nMiho Nishizumi - I thought she was the steriotypical normal anime character. Miho was friendly, bubbly, girly, and peppy. She never gave up on anyone and was determined like no others.\\n\\n\r\nSaori Takebe - Oh right, this girl. -.- She's the radio and machine gun operator of the Anglerfish. Saori was sterioptyped as the \"flirty\" chick. Although she comforted a couple of characters, I just despised her of her bubblyness. Enough said, I'm moving on.\\n\\n\r\nHana Isuzu - Oh, right! This is the geeky girl I was a fan of. Hana was a chill, pretty, polite tank shooter/driver loved by the Panzer crowd. She was one of those rare girls that actually looks somewhat Asian.\\n\\n\r\nYukari Akiyama - Here we go, another good character. I personally liked Yukari because she had that tomboyish, outgoing spunk which you don't normally get out of an anime girl. She was obsessed with tanks, too busy loving them for a social life. She's the gunner/loader positioner.\\n\\n\r\nMako Reizei - She was mostly the dark chibi girl that stayed calm and didn't let anything get to her. She was mostly this cute, low blood-pressured emotionless robot.\\n\\n\r\n                           Art:\\n\r\nComputer animation was used for the tanks, (which looked odd, but whatever) but mostly everything else was hand-drawn like most anime. *Shoves RWBY away* The character designs we're the most creative. but they didn't need to be because it's not an adventure/apocalypse anime.  \\n\\n\r\n                         Music:\\n\r\nOh god once I finished the first episode, I got onto osu! as quickly as I could and searched for the opening as a beatmap. And luckily, it was there. (And luckily I stayed up for the rest of the night working on getting it perfected!) The opening is DreamRiser by ChouCho. (Right now I'm watching the opening and uncontrollably am screaming along the lyrics) The opening explains Girls Und Panzer very well and fluently. It squeezes in most of the characters in their own way of sass they express in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Girls Und Panzer was a fast, fun anime. I'm really excited about the movie that will be released in December, 2017. There should be more light anime for tweens that aren't for 4 year-olds like Digemon or Sailor Moon, but they shouldn't be watching Code Geass or Fairy Tail either. Thanks for taking your time for reading this long review, and tell me how you thought.\\n\\n\r\n                                         -PawLin",

            "content": "This show really didn't have the right be this good.\r\nI'm sure a lot of you guys reading this right now are a lot like I was when I first heard of this show, thinking things like: \"What is this, little girls piloting tanks? This has to be some stupid loli show, surely the person who recommended this to me was just trolling.\" But I'm here to tell you that despite the shows questionable premise it's actually pretty good, not a masterpiece but a lot better than you would be lead to believe. \r\nLet's start with the story, which is pretty simple. In this world Tankbattling is a sport called Tankery. Miho Nishizumi is part of the Nishizumi family, which runs a prestigious tankery school however due to an incident prior to the events of the show she no longer wants to participate in tankery and goes so far as to pick a school which doesn't have tankery as an elective. Everything works out well, she even makes some friends despite her shy personality. That is until the student council announces that they're bringing tankery back as an elective and that they're forcing Miho to participate due to the fact that for some reason they need to win the next tankery tournament and Miho is the only person in school with prior experience in the sport. \\n\\n\r\nJoining Miho are her friends Saori Takebe: The cliche girly girl who is friendly with everyone and who calls herself a \"love expert\"...despite the fact that she doesn't a boyfriend herself. and Hana Isuzu: A girl with a calm demeanor who practices flower arranging. Before eventually being joined by Yukari Akiyama: A girl who is completely obsessed with tanks and hasn't exactly had much of a social life because of that. and my personal favorite Mako Reizei, who's entire character arc revolves around the fact that she's too tired to give a shit and is only participating in tankery because she'll fail school if she doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also a pretty large cast of side characters but outside of the student council barely any of them get any real depth or development. However this doesn't stop the english dub from casting some pretty big name (for anime standards anyway) Voice actors to play some of them, the two biggest examples being Tiffany Grant of Evangelion fame and Monica Rial (Who is best known for being Mae Chang in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Index in a Certain Magical Index). \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly enough the show actually focuses a lot more on the tank stuff than it does slice of life or fanservice (In fact there are only two scenes that could even qualify as fanservice and even then they're really tame.) elements. And the tank battles themselves are pretty damn impressive, the time when the tanks are CG while noticeable doesn't clash with the 2d animation at all and the maneuvers and tactics while unrealistic (I assume, I don't know much about tanks) especially as the series goes on are extremely fun to watch and make the battles thrilling.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real complaints I have about the show is that as mentioned earlier barely any of the side characters get anything resembling depth or development, they're just there to pilot tanks and the fact that if you're listening to the english dub you're really going to get sick of one musical track in particular.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show was a lot better than it really should've been considering the premise. I guess there's a reason that it got a movie.",

            "content": "Don't like reading? Never fear. Video review here: https://youtu.be/tDNdmrXDld0\r\n Have you ever had that one show you sit down to watch and you know, no matter how many check boxes it rattles off on your \u201cshould I watch this\u201d checklist, you can never let any of your friends know you\u2019ve watched it, because it\u2019ll be critically terrible, but it\u2019ll be a perfect guilty pleasure show for you, and then it actually turns out to be legitimately good, and now you can never tell anyone because they\u2019re going to think the same negative things you thought about it? Well, Girls und Panzer is that show forme.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer at first glance appears to be some weird moe-blob show with some tanks thrown in to get the militaria geeks\u2019 attention, but this show is actually a tournament sports anime, and if there\u2019s one thing I love in my anime more than tanks, it\u2019s a goddamn tournament. I think the original Dragonball is actually better paced than Z because of the many tournaments in the series, my favorite saga of Yu Yu Hakusho is the Dark Tournament saga, and I prefer the original Yugioh to GX because of . . .well. . . the tournaments. Hell I don\u2019t even give a fuck about basketball, but you will sure as hell find me glued to my TV and filling out a bracket every year when March Madness kicks in.\\n\\n\r\n        As per usual for moe shows, Girls und Panzer focuses on one main with her core group of three to five friends, but the tournaments in which they compete are on a platoon level, which means that there are four other tanks, each with their own crew that tag along as well, but unfortunately the show never goes into any depth with most of them. That\u2019s regrettable, because look at the girls behind the sticks of the StuG III. Look at them!\\n\\n\r\n        Who are they? Where did they come from? Why are they dressed like that? Why are they always quoting Caesar and other great generals? Not a single one of these questions is answered. Attack on Titan went into depth with their cast, despite how massive it was, and I can still rattle off over a dozen characters from that show right of the top of my head. With Girls und Panzer? Ehhhhh, not so much. Even the name of the main girl escapes me for a while. (It\u2019s Miho, by the way)\\n\\n\r\n            So, in the tournament, the school ships pair off in, oh yeah school ships. . . . look at this shit.\\n\\n\r\n        That\u2019s . . . that\u2019s just fucking cool. I have nothing else to say about it other than we need a naval-based spin off series of this immediately. So yeah, these school ships pair off in these 5v5-ish battles with each school being populated by walking, talking stereotypes of the countries that they are supposed to represent. The British are fair, chivalrous, and way too preoccupied with not spilling their tea. The Americans are loud assholes who bend the rules to win. The Russians are cold blooded stoics that rely on home-field advantage. And the Germans believe zat zhe best tank is zhe tiger tank and zhe tiger tank alvays vins!\\n\\n\r\n        How do these tournament matches go? Well, they\u2019re quite entertaining. They take a number of twists and turns and instead of going down the overused Deus Ex Machina route of total ass pulls, Miho and her gang of motley tankerettes win their battles via cunning strategy and deft tactical judgment. They simply outthink their opponents who see them as mere underdogs who have only gotten as far as they have due to a series of flukes. They even go so far as to use real tactics taken from WW2 historical accounts. I like that. Good on you, show. Treat your audience like adult- . . . well as much of an adult as I can be. I mean, I\u2019m watching a show about highschoolers fighting in school sanctioned tank tournaments.\\n\\n\r\n            Also, they\u2019re not using paintball rounds either. This is live ammo people! Hell, one group of girls gets hit, they\u2019re tank is knocked out, and they have to put out a frikkin\u2019 fire inside of it. What the hell? I don\u2019t remember the football team at my school ever having to do something that batshit crazy. Speaking of what-the-fuckery, why are there no males at this school . . . or any of the schools? There\u2019s males in the show, but they are only ever shown once or twice. The schools aren\u2019t girls\u2019 academies. The girls attending these schools always talk about meeting their boyfriends and shit, but where the hell are they? The tankery clubs are all female because the show makes a half assed attempt to explain that girls who practice tankery grow up to be fine and desirable women, but as far as I can see, all the girls who tell their family that they\u2019re in the tankery club get treated like shit because of it.\\n\\n\r\n        As visuals go, the level of detail in this show is stunning. All the tanks are rendered in CG so 3D models have to be made for each tank type and they nail them all dead on right down to the fucking rivets. And trust me, I know they got the tanks right, I play World of Tanks, bruh. On top of all that the show has an immense offering of tank facts and trivia that\u2019ll make WW2 geeks like me salivate at the very mention of the phrase, \u201cEighty-eight millimeter main gun.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n        With sound, the opening and ending credits are okay, the Japanese voice cast is alright, but the English actresses just completely phone this one in. It\u2019s really unfortunate because the animators and designers obviously put a lot of hard work and TLC into this project. The music however is on point. The jaunty little military pieces that play during the battles and as such offer a light hearted touch that fits the show perfectly. Unfortunately this is shot down immediately for me, because the best music piece of the whole show, Katyusha, is omitted. Originally sung by soviet soldiers in World War II and later famously performed by the Red Army Choir, it was covered by the Japanee voice cast who sang it, in fucking Russian, and the North American release apparently couldn\u2019t secure the rights to Katyusha, so they replaced it with the fucking Tetris theme.\\n\\n\r\n        I\u2019m willing to largely forgive this due to the sound effects they managed to put together for this. Every tank sounds a little bit different and unique in its own right. From the initial rev of the engine to its cruising speed, each group of tanks puts up its own chorus of diesel, oil, and steel. As a guy who grew up on racetracks in the southeast listening to hundreds of different engines rev and pitch, I can really appreciate the commitment that takes.\\n\\n\r\n       Overall, Girls und Panzer is a fantastic little show that has an even-handed mix of historically based trivia and narrative pacing that culminates into a show that I honestly think most people will enjoy, whether they be history buffs like me or just the passing anime fan looking for a short and sweet anime to grab their attention. My only complaint is that there hasn\u2019t been that naval spin-off show yet. Oh wait. . .\\n\\n\r\nHigh School Fleet review incoming. . .",

            "content": "Initially, I felt indifferent towards the Girls und Panzer. I gave it a fairly mediocre rating and moved on from it, almost forgetting it entirely. I had the interest of re-watching it with one of my friends after seeing their growing curiosity toward it, as well as my interest to remember why I rated something like this as low as I did. Needless to say, part of my opinion changed, but not all of it. Most of this won't be too unique from what NotDolphy has already summed up pretty well, but do read on if you desire. Though, it will contain spoilers.\r\nApproaching an animelike Girls und Panzer, your tendencies toward how you feel about the CGDCT genre starts to boil. However, you then forget about that after you start the anime and realize this is cute girls doing serious things. They never really suffer any 'serious' repercussions, despite how excellent their tanks are at acrobatics and sometimes even abruptly fly both far and fast from a blast, but we will talk about that more later. With this anime, you do indeed have the most notable breaking point, something that most anime of the CGDCT genre seem to overlook. That being \"what if the girls were doing things that were not cute\" and we come across something that, well hasn't made a huge dent on the genre, has certainly opened up a lot of eyes. And in some cases, even convinced former disinterested folk of the CGDCT genre to give it a closer look.\\n\\n\r\nIt should come as no surprise that the majority of anime viewers like to look at the female characters the most. They generally have the most unique designs, are more fun to watch and a cast of all females avoids the infamous abuse humor you typically see involving the male characters doing anything that remotely upsets the female. Girls und Panzer is giving us the most raw designs established over the years that the majority of viewers have grown used to. You have a big cast of big-eyed, small-nosed, cute-looking females and not a single one will be a stranger to someone's affection because of this. None of the girls look unappealing in the slightest and are drawn on model very well.\\n\\n\r\nI can not stress enough how much this anime wants you to avoid, well, stress. Around the moment the anime starts (beyond the brief sequence spoiling some of the fourth episode), you are introduced to the main girl who, for literally a brief moment, has no friends at her school and is alone in her thoughts, worrying over an event of the past. Then, immediately, she is literally treated to a couple of best friends right off the bat. Oh, how I'm sure everyone would love for life to be that easy. But, I kid you not, they love her the moment before they met her. Despite the anime occasionally having a moments of \"conflict\" throughout their battles, this is the only real time you are treated to something more akin to a drama, though you could fail to take it seriously due to how little time you had to grow fond of the characters. Even re-watching this and remembering everyone, I still did not feel as much for this episode as it wanted me to.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of pacing, this is where the heaviest negatives I have will begin. Despite how high of a re-score I gave it, these criticisms are going to sound harsh. The pacing in this anime is a real mess. The first episode tried to introduce you to Miho, give her best friends right off the bat to form a bond, throw the activity they are going to do, the serious backstory of Miho and her initial refusal to join the sport of tanks (Tankwondo, Tankery or whatever bias you formed first) at the demand of the student council. You know, all in twenty minutes. Now, I am not going to completely destroy this anime with the statement it could have done better with twenty-four episodes instead of twelve, given the budget really needed to prioritize the tank battles and, objectively, they could not do more than twelve. However, I will say they could have spaced the events of the first episode into a couple. And that thirteen episodes is commonplace as well, so they could have simply had a set of two episodes and them not involving tanks would have already saved plenty of budget. No matter who you are, longevity is something you need in order to bond with anyone. You can not automatically start feeling stressed over the tribulations of Miho when you take in how little time they gave you to love her. As such, the entirety of the first episode is the biggest weakness the anime has.\\n\\n\r\nHad I had the authority to decide the episode count, I would have said thirteen so that the first two episodes would involved Miho's introduction, a more natural way for her to meet Saori and Hana, them hearing about Miho's sadness more naturally, they all bond, they see the propag- I mean educational film about Tankwondo, Miho upright refuses Anzu, Saori and Hana comfort Miho and she has a revelation that performing Tankwondo can help overcome her PTSD and neglect from her family. I appreciated already how much Saori and Hana were with Miho, despite only knowing her for a day, but the whole \"serious\" vibe the final scene of the first episode gives you is butchered so heavily by being in, well, the first episode. This anime is not labeled as a drama at all, so something like this happening so soon and treated so intensively is confusing, especially when you consider how polite the student council treats Miho after this. I genuinely believe that one or two tank battles being shortened would have allowed so much more room for growing the cast properly.\\n\\n\r\nPacing gets mildly better after the first episode, but as people say, the first impression tends to stay on you the strongest. You have most likely met a person where you screwed up the first time you met them and that changed their entire viewpoint on you. Girls und Panzer can feel this way due to how awfully paced the first episode is. And I'm certain there is a reason why many reviews avoid talking about it on here for that reason. It is established that this anime throws around plot points a lot, simply so they can get right into the tank battles and this is a big problem with an anime that established, the moment you started watching it, that it wanted to capitalize on the girls' relationships with each other as they grow closer in both friendship and teamwork. Exposition would have saved this anime a lot for me, perhaps enough where I would have nearly doubled my initial score for it. With that, the tank battles and enjoyable design, the anime would have for sure been around an eight or higher for its overall score.\\n\\n\r\nBut, first episode and lack of exposition aside, you can thankfully be happy that this anime made sure the main activity was the most enjoyable. The tank battles are nicely animated, are usually a joy to watch and have comical interactions among the teams. As I said, character development suffered the most, but that means the extra time went somewhere else and that is precisely why you will get the best kick out of the tank battles more than anywhere else. This should be where your attention goes the most if you wish to seek the most enjoyment out of this anime. It is also a bit strange that this anime is not listed in the \"Comedy\" genre when considering how bizarre the tank antics get. I believe every viewer had at least one moment where they were laughing uncontrollably over the way this anime treats physics. And a lot of the girls usually act comical as well. Simply being funny doesn't automatically mean it should be in the entire genre, but this anime has a lot of comedy, so I believe it may have for sure been extremely close to being labeled as such.\\n\\n\r\nReally, I can not stress enough how positively the tank battles were received. They were so good that, eventually, the anime branched far beyond a series and made OVAs, a theatrical film and even has a series of movies planned, though you really have your heart out for die-hard fans of the anime who may not even get to finish it until around 2023-2027, depending on how delayed the final productions are if they want them to be spectacular. And it has a couple of video games that feel just like the anime you watched, a very rare case indeed for an anime video game, especially of the CGDCT genre. And to top it off, one of them is entirely in English when importing, so amazingly, it is not Japanese exclusive. The latter of the two games has amazing fan service, online battles and is a must buy for hardcore fans of the series.\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer, for me, falls under a case where it poured so much passion into its goal that I can not hate it for neglecting character development. It is not the primary reason you watch the anime after all, but this could have been remedied by at least pacing the development they decided to give us better. If you are going to commit to something, do it properly or not at all. That aside, you will have a real treat with this series and, if you enjoy it, you have plenty more to look forward to over the years! And that is a very big statement for an anime in the CGDCT genre to last longer than a decade. Generally, they have twelve episodes and nothing more and are usually forgotten very quickly. I honestly can not stress enough how unique Girls und Panzer is in regard to how successful it became with the genre it has. \\n\\n\r\nThat is the most amazing feat of the anime, as I have already made very clear by this point, and for any viewers who appose them, you owe it to yourself to watch the one that changed things up the most. As I said, if more of them changed that second part regarding the \"things\" they do, I imagine we could have more unique treasures in the anime world like Girls und Panzer. The cute things are enjoyable and stuff, and even this anime has a lot of those moments, but the primary activity usually being them interacting in school, their houses, etc. It grows old for even fans of them. I hope more creators are not afraid to step out of boundaries with it, especially with the success Girls und Panzer has achieved.\\n\\n\r\nSo then, naturally, my best advice is to watch beyond the first episode. Don't be afraid of its inadequate start, for it grows into a much better anime if you allow it to.",

The story following are main protagonist as they work together a band of misfits to take on the world of a all woman's sport known as Tankery!\r\n------Story. Ranked 7(Good)\r\nI only gave the Story a 7 because there's been a trend to the whole \"Drafted Main Protagonist into the Sport\" thing that's been done a number times over. My main point out to this would be the popular \"Sabagebu!\" anime about our young protagonist being \"Drafted\" into joining a club. Outside of that the twodon't share anything else together.\\n\r\n------Art&Sound. Ranked 8(Very Good)\\n\r\nFor an anime that puts highschool girls into fighting Tanks the art style is pretty unique. The art tells as well shows the gravity of each shot being shot, the damage is being fully shown, stuff is being ripped apart like it should normally if you was in a real tank fight. Does the stuff go overboard with how stuff happens? Sometimes. The Maus encounter was defeintly a bit over the top, I mean forget the fact you're facing a small army of tanks but now we're gonna drop you into some Armored Core-esc logic and put lots of small people against a massive tank! The sounding in the game is so believable that I honestly thought the fight was happening on screen. That's some pretty great work put into it. \\n\r\n------Characters. Ranked 8(Very Good) \\n\r\nOur main lead is somewhat of a deus ex when given the chance. A supposed \"family bound\" ace that gave up the life of being an ace like the other members of her family and wanted to be a normal girl. Its pretty saddening what happened so I wont spoil it for you but let's just say it will get you a bit. The characters are somewhat stereotypical but they're enjoyable to watch and when you get over that they really show they are willing to go all in when needed to. From the Student Council members to some of the other Tankery crews, its pretty enjoyable to watch them interact with the main protagonist, their crew and each other on the battlefield.\\n\r\n------Enjoyment. Ranked 10(Outstanding)\\n\r\nAs someone that has played and enjoyed World of Tanks along with watching a slew of School-like anime Girls und Panzer is an amazing piece of anime. The show only had 12 episodes but I think the number of episodes was well warranted. From the fights to the development of the characters on and off the battlefield its just an amazing ride through and through.\\n\r\n------Overall. Ranked 9(Great)\\n\r\nIf it wasn't for the story premise of the show I would of given it a 10 no questions asked. However while it did keep me from 10/10'ing the show I'd still rewatch it and recommend it. The show has promise for anyone wanting to watch a somewhat high paced fighting tank anime with anime highschoolers.",

            "content": "Girls und Panzer\r\nGuilty pleasures... everyone has one show, one song, one food, or whatever, that they are ashamed to admit to liking. You say you hate all that Taylor Swift crap, but then you catch yourself singing \u201eWe are never, ever, ever, ever, getting back together!\u201c in the shower (you know who you are). I am no exception to this rule, and I do love me some Taylor Swift, but that's not what I want to talk about. Instead, let's talk about Girls und Panzer! \r\n[Story: 7/10] In the world of Girls und Panzer, it is a common thing for girls and young women tolearn the ways of \u201ePanzerfahren\u201c; Sensha-do as the anime calls it, which basically means the operation of tanks. Nishizumi Miho, quickly gets involved in tankery and her school takes part in the Sensha-do Championship, which basically means tank-battles. That is basically all there is to it. This is very much like a  Slice of Life, except with tanks. There are minor sub-plots regarding the individual characters, which I'll get back to, but the main focus of the show is the Championship and the struggle of our main heroine to lead her school to victory, despite all adversity. Nothing new, rather a known concept with a unique twist on it. The show is fairly minimal, but it does most of what it set out to do well. There is no heavy reliance on plot-convenience, most of it seems believable given the context of the show. A very nice story about overcoming adversity and challenges. I really liked that tankery was not just thrown in as a quirky little gimmick, but weaved into the world of the show rather elegantly. There are families, where it is unthinkable for a daughter not to practise Sensha-do, where this art has been practised for generations, some others who revile it as brutish and archaic. It is part of the society and culture. Now, there are some minor little nitpicks I do have. We are talking about full on tank-battles here, with live ammo. So, this not being a story about war, it may be a little hard to believe how eager these girls are to participate and how no one ever seems to die because of these battles, despite being in ostensibly mortal peril. And the characters constantly worry about each others well-being, so it's not like not dying is taken for granted. Also, there are some jabs at traditional gender-roles, tanks, of course, being traditionally driven by adult men, and the show does mention that a couple of times, but never really does more than that, which I found to be a little bit of a shame. \\n\\n\r\n[Characters: 5/10] The show introduces lots of different characters over the course of its runtime. We are first introduced to our heroine and her ever-increasing tank batallion and, as the show progresses, to the opponents, who all vaguely represest different nations. There is the main team, which is the one we are all rooting for, the British team, the American team, the Russian team and the German team. Unfortunately this is where the show falls flat a bit, because most of the characters have next to no development or even character traits. I don't know if this was the show trying to keep too many plates spinning simultaneously, with the enormous amount of side-characters, or if it was just half-hearted characterization. Either way, we are left with a troff full of secondary characters, who get one character trait, which often falls into sad clich\u00e9s. And I mean, the British girls spending half their screentime drinking tea levels of clich\u00e9 here, so you know it's bad. While things do get more rounded with our main cast, they too fall victim to overused tropes: There is the Tsundere one, the overly excited one, and so on... There are some sub-plots with some characters, usually revolving around their conflicting relationships with Sensha-do, but those too are mostly taken nowhere, or magically resolved. Where the show gets, maybe not a gold star, but a silver star, is in the relationship between the characters, which for the most part seems believable (if someone shallow), and I feel that this is where the focus was, as this is a show about friends overcoming challenges together. Plus the positive dynamic between the characters made me smile several times, and perhaps that's all you should expect from a show like this.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 6/10] There is not much I can say about the visuals of Girls und Panzer, just because of how standard and unexceptional they are. From the character designs to the backgrounds, nothing screams out \u201eawesomesauce\u201c and assaults the viewer with beauty. This is not necessarily a bad thing, however don't expect the best looking anime. Everything looks fine, nothing is terribly bad, but that's all one can say: It's fine... The animation of the tanks is done entirely in CG, and to the attentive viewer it will show, by what I mean, it could have been done better. I personally, as someone who does not know much about animation and has not watched every anime in existence, was not bothered by this too much. I could notice it, but it did not take me out of the experience. The tanks move alright, it seems authentic (mostly), and best of all, I admire the fidelity of the animators. The tanks, from what I could tell, are authentic representations of their real-life counterparts. Furthermore I found it interesting to research the tanks shown in Girls und Panzer and find out more about them. \\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 7/10] The sound of Girls und Panzer fares, in my opinion, better than the visuals. The music is cheerful and does its job of getting the viewer in the right mindset for the show. At the same time it is not too saccarine and cutesy. Most of the music are renditions of military marching songs, which have quite the positive effect, at least they did for me. There is even a rendition of a Russian folk-song from the 30s, when the time comes for our heroines to fight the Russian team, which I found lovely. The characters' voices are not... too annoying, but they do fall into the very high-pitched range sometimes. Also, the tanks sound at least sort of believable, although that is hard for me to verify, since I have never heard the sounds of an actual tank. As for the different versions, I typically do not watch dubbed anime, but I have heard that the dub is kinda shit, so maybe watch it subbed, which I think is always better anyways. \\n\\n\r\n[Personal Enjoyment: 8/10] Despite the flaws I pointed out during this review, despite the show being unexceptional when it comes to the artstyle, underwhelming with its individual character arcs I have to admit, that I really enjoyed watching this anime. Every episode had a pleasant effect for me, and I don't really know if that's a praise for the show, or an indictment of my personal taste. Girls und Panzer made me feel uplifted, cheerful, happy. And for this type of show, I think that's all that one should expect from this show. While I will probably not rewatch the show in the near future, I definetly am happy to have watched it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking to be enthralled by a gripping epic about war, and the absurdities of combat and the brutality of tank-battles, then what the fuck are you still doing here? It should be pretty clear by now that this is not what Girls und Panzer is about. But if you want a cute Moe anime to cheer you up, but also want something different from the unending flood of Moe out there than I can wholeheartedly reccomend you check this show out! \\n\\n\r\n[7/10]",

(merge between 2D and 3D).\\n\\n\r\nThe facts about the tanks are quite on point though you will find yourself pausing to actually catch the facts they are telling you, It would be better to google about it after watching the episode, \\n\\n\r\nThis anime has recap episodes ( Episodes 5.5 and 10.5)\\n\r\nEpisode 5.5 recapping on the events of Episodes 1 through 5 while introducing you to our main cast and supporting cast. (plus their tanks)\\n\r\nEpisode 10.5 recapping the events of Episodes 6 through 10 while introducing you to any other character they have yet to introduce (plus their tanks)\\n\\n\r\n(In my personal opinion, If I was watching this as it came out, 1 week per episode kind of deal, I would be pissed off if the episode of the week is a recap :/ especially since they end the episode mid-battle.)\\n\\n\r\nThe character's are a fun group with a wide range of personalities, Some being developed more than others but they're relate-able.\\n\\n\r\nI've personally enjoyed the season and looking forward to more .\\n\\n\r\n===========================================\\n\r\nReview divided into categories\\n\\n\r\nStory : 8/10 : I personally enjoyed the story it has some (very little) slice-of-life elements though if your looking for cute girls in action then you will definitely enjoy it, \\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10 : No complaints about the art style, The art style meets the quality that allows the viewers to enjoy it without a problem, 2D Characters 3D Tank battles, I personally found the animation look out of place during the opening scene of episode 1, (If you read my other reviews, I rate 10/10 for *unique art styles that are well done).\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10 : The sound is well done both in Voice Acting (Japanese Dub) and Sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8/10 : A nice range of personalities exists between our main and supporting characters. Though characters feel a little underdeveloped. It's more about the tank battles anyway in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9/10 : I personally enjoyed this anime more than I should, actually almost cried during one of the scenes, really enjoyed the battles lots of cool strats.\\n\\n\r\n*Unique Art Style - An art style that when seen by a viewer is easily recognizable between animes. (Same studio Different Anime, Viewer can tell its from the same studio)\\n\\n\r\n=============================================\\n\r\nI hope you found my review useful\\n\r\nOtherwise if you didn't please leave a comment as too why\\n\r\n=============================================\\n\r\nMinor Complaint (Does not lower the watch value of this anime)\\n\r\nSports in anime's, especially when it's extreme out of the norm sports. \\n\r\nAre always unfair, The richer team always has an advantage and honestly in a real world situation I wouldn't find it interesting to watch a sport where the richer team always wins cause they had more tanks than the others. \\n\r\n=============================================",

            "content": "There are cute girls and badass tanks, 10/10!\r\nMore seriously, this anime is something of a mixed bag. If you're looking for a strong story and complex characters, you're going to be disappointed. On the other, if you're mainly interested in the tank battles and an average story with cute girls, this show will be fantastic. The tanks are the main premise that this anime is built and falls on, and it does it remarkably well. \r\nIn contrast to other works in the mecha musume genre (e.g \"Strike Witches,\" \"Upotte!!,\" etc.) this anime is mostly free from fanservice, which was much appreciated. \r\nUnfortunately, the anime fallsflat on both story & characters. The story is a bland, generic sports plot line where a ragtag team of underdogs goes up against teams with much more experience and better equipment, and come out winning on sheer force of perseverance. Were it not for the tanks, this would likely be just another generic sports anime. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the background characters such as Erwin and Caesar (history nerds nicknamed after Erwin Rommel and Julius Caesar respectively) are memorable, and I honestly wish the anime had been centered around them. The main characters are easily forgettable, despite attempts to get us to sympathize and relate to them. \\n\\n\r\nBut this anime is about tanks, so what about tanks, you might ask? The thing that saves this anime from being a generic sports anime is the tanks. They're bloody fantastic. They really did their jobs researching the various tanks and putting them into the anime. As a history nerd, I've got to appreciate the massive amount of detail they put into the various vehicles, from the American Sherman, to the German StuG, and even the Italian P40. It gets such a high rating in art from me primarily because of how much detail was put into the tanks.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a history nerd or someone interested in armored fighting vehicles, this anime is the one for you. But if you're primarily interested in plot and characters, this probably isn't going to do it for you.",

This is a small, but well thought out series enticing to multiple genres of people. The best part about this series that draws you in is the Art and story.\r\nStory -\r\nThe girls at Oarai High School practice Sensha-do, operating armored tanks! They take it seriously too, and since winning the national Sensha-do championship is such a huge deal at Oarai, they sometimes go to extreme ends in order to get the best students from Panzer class to signup. -\\n\r\nWhat can I say, very simple story that is very well thought out. You have these 5 main moe girls driving tanks. They use strategy and each have their own quality that brings them out. The fact they use actual tanks developed over the years is what sparks your interest.\\n\\n\r\nArt-\\n\r\nThe art is great, eye appealing, there really isn't much more to be said. \\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\r\nThe sound is fine as well, I usually just pass over the opening and ending, so i lowered the score a bit. Nothing appealing. Good Seiyuus.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\r\nI gave character the lowest score. I feel like every team around the main girls team is more appealing. They look so normal it hurts sometimes. The main girl isn't very appealing to me. If I had to pick anyone I would choose Mako as a main character. This however does not take from the experience and enjoyment of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\r\nWhat can I say... Tanks... Strategies... Lets shoot stuff.",

The story is about Miho, a school girl who has had a rough history with panzer and was basically exploited into joining her new school's panzer club. However overtime she realizes that it may have been one of the best things she could have done, despite her past. It's definitely an interesting concept of what it would be like if schools added a \"tank\" club to their list of extracurricular's. Albeit, a very costly club atthat. \\n\\n\r\nNow many of the characters are skimmed over throughout the show. We get a lot of Miho's team, but not so much of anyone else. I really wish they would have dived a bit deeper into the other teams and their history before Miho's team had their encounters. But even so, the addition of interesting characters, as well as pretty damn good pacing, kinda smooths the show out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I had a really fun time watching this. It's really...different from your average school-girl plot. While it could have definitely been longer, I feel that the pacing was good enough to suffice for the 12 episodes we got. Great characters, great animations, and an OP that get's stuck in your head. I definitely recommend you give this show a watch!",

(OVA), Girls und Panzer der Film, and Girls und Panzer das Finale \u3011\r\nDid you ever think you would see a show where adorable high school girls casually rode tanks through a small town, demolishing buildings like they\u2019re flimsy cardboard replicas? Neither did I. Welcome to Girls und Panzer, taking place on a military base\u2026 on a battleship\u2026 that looks like a town, where girls are funded by the government to join the prestigious tank club and volley against each other in nationalistic teams to beatone another in a survival game of sorts.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 There are townspeople in this series that actually hope that their store or home will get demolished during a tank skirmish, so that the government will pay to renovate their old building. There are other ships with similar situations, that look like floating islands, representing different nations. This series is the epitome of every military otakus\u2019 fantasy.  \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I am personally not a military otaku myself, but I found this show to be one of the funnest anime series that I\u2019ve ever watched. It\u2019s ridiculous and does ridiculous things knowing that it can get away with it because it\u2019s fiction, and because no one\u2019s going to take a series seriously that has teenage girls battling in tanks. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 There is depth in the characters. The main girl, Miho, comes from an abusive, high maintenance military family that disowned her because she couldn\u2019t battle in tanks due to psychological trauma. She developed PTSD from her comrades nearly drowning in their tank during a skirmish with dangerous weather conditions. Her older sister is hailed as the best tank commander, and so comparatively, Miho has to deal with real world problems and living in her sister\u2019s shadow.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 She\u2019s decides to get in a tank again with her friends\u2019 coercion, but there\u2019s a lot of internal struggle\u30fcwith the memories of her past failure residing in her psyche. The other characters are really likable: there\u2019s a girl who comes from a high-class family that believes in traditional Japanese women should partake in flower arranging, instead of firing paint shots from a tank. After all of the ridicule and fear of opening up to them, she stands up to her family\u2019s rigid traditions and is able to make beautiful flower arrangements WHILE ALSO putting her all into her tank hobby.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 There\u2019s a girl who\u2019s desperately trying to find a boyfriend, but ends up joining a tank club of all things. A military otaku who lives and breathes tanks and artillery guns. And, lastly, a cat-like girl who sleeps all of the time. Because, every moe show needs one of these. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 There\u2019s also a very diverse and interesting line of characters from the other ships that are entertaining to watch. I found the Russian team particularly interesting. Overall, if you have free time and a craving for something that is campy and amazing, then pick up or stream Girls und Panzer.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022  I was amazed with how much I liked it, as a girl who has no interest in those sorts of things. It even made me consider collecting model tanks. This series is empowering, brave, and bold! I give the TV series for Girls und Panzer a 8/10, the OVA a 6/10, Girls und Panzer der Film a 6/10, and Girls und Panzer das Finale a 7/10.",

            "content": "Girls und Panzer... an anime about secondary girls and World War II tanks...\r\nI saw this anime three times... but the first time I do not understand nothing of the plot.  It was because of the main character, Miho, that starts in a new school   and for some reason does not like the \"Maneuvers with tanks\" a kind of extracurricular assignature... Well she does like it until the end of the first episode without reason she decide to participate in this assignature in spite of she stay all the episode saying that she won't choose \"Maneuvers with tanks\" because she had bad memoriesabout it... BUT IN THE END she choose it...\\n\r\nAt this moment the first time I saw the anime a question came to my mind \"What kind of hypocrite is Miho?\" \\n\r\nShe was saying that she has bad memories about \"Maneuvers with tanks\" and then she choose  \"Maneuvers with tanks\". why? They never explain it in the anime, they will explain why she had bad memories about  \"Maneuvers with tanks\"... But they won't explain WHY se change her opinion in the last moment...\\n\r\nThe next 11 episodes you will see a lot of battles with Tanks, yeah, but they'll have a problem with some characters that looks like total idiots...\\n\r\nMiho has a big sister in another academy that has a lot of tanks... The problem with this is WHAT Miho do in this academy...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSPOOOOOOOILER ALEEEERT\\n\r\nWe must suppose that Miho the only with common sense in this school because they were in the final and one of the tanks fell to a very deep river... Miho left the tank to save her comrades and they lost because they hit the Miho's tank... And then her mother say that she was a dishonor for her family... \\n\r\nI mean. Is serious? Your daughter risk her life to save her comrades and you said that SHE IS A DISHONOR FOR YOUR FAMILY?\\n\\n\\n\r\nAt the end you can enjoy the show... but all of this points make that the plot has some weak points that you can not understand what's happening... I mean, for example: Miho when she finnally reach the battle against her sister... well her sister treat her like trash... Would be better if Miho let her comrades die inside the tank? \\n\r\nEveryone in her situation would make the same CHOICE. What kind of monsters are her family?\\n\\n\r\nThe sound... well, if you listen carefully you could heard some World War II songs but... It's not a big deal... I'm not a fan of war songs, they're placed correctly but for me it's all I can say about them...\\n\\n\r\nThe Art... it's good, inclusive  the 3D.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters... As I said about Miho, my main problem with she is the one I mentioned... \\n\r\nBut it's curious that I only could remember her name, the rest of the characters except the Panzer Team are for have a big roster, these characters always make some stupid thing in a crucial moment because the Panzer Team is the star of the show who must destroy the enemies... \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a great show, but for me there're some problems that could be improve when they were planning the anime, like Miho choosing \"Maneuver with tanks\" making a contradiction with what she said minutes early in the first chapter...",

What makes the action scenes exciting is that the tanks act like cars and are busy skidding and sliding all over the place\r\nThe main problem is that it is a bit too sugary.  The girls are cute, there isn't really a fitting antagonist for the main protagonist, and you know that the girls will win, no matter what...  The \"enemies\" are certainly no strategists (and mostly cant aim) which makes theconstant winning by the girls rather annoying - you just know how everything is going to end.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the character development is nice even if more could have been made of it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's certainly worth watching if you want something action-packed, but light and fluffy...",

The physics weren't very good but a lot of the time you could overlook this as it was enjoyable. Most of the anime was battling and combat scenes which meant that the characters were very difficult to bond to and this pulled down the anime. Overall, the best part of it was probably it's music with tracks like Katyusha: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehhitnnB22k if you want to have a listen, there it is. I at least found this an enjoyable anime,but not the best anime i've watched and not one i will plan on re-watching, except for using the songs on youtube that is.",

            "content": "The entire show is based around Girls driving tanks and attempts to shove as many tank battles into the show as possible, creating a very fast plot speed which quickly got in the way of the characters and their development and backgrounds. Events that happened for the characters were over in a blink of eye and didn't seem to affect them much even as it was happening. Furthermore characters quickly U-turned with their opinions and together made them seem shallow. \r\nHowever, it was equally obvious that the plot speed was designed to bring about as many tank battles throughout the series as it possibly could,which could be described as its saving grace. The battles were very well done with interesting camera angles and kept the show from going stale. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters did seem shallow there were still some attempts at comedy in the narration however these were far and few between and often the same gag over and over. Other supportive characters were created with stereotypes in mind and while it isn't very offensive, keep in mind that it will happen. Also there aren't any ecchi moments and few fan service moments to keep viewers interested in the characters. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I felt that it was an alright anime that might of been better with less tank battles, and more character and background development.",

The music was good.  I enjoyed the use of the different countries' patriotic songs.  The characters seemed shallow at first, but seemed to grow in depth as the series progressed.The story was actually unique, a rarity this day and age.

            "content": "Okay so, be warned of spoilers. \r\nI liked this anime, truly I did. The anime is about a girl who used to practice this sport of tanks, but she quit suddenly when she failed to beat her sister during a competition. The reason she lost was because one of her teammates in the competition could have died, if she did not help them/her escape from the tank. Anyways, present time. The new village she just moved into, just decided to get into the whole 'Competition'. The reason why, is if they lose (Again I think.) their school has to close down. So the MC andher friends decide to go into the tank sport, and give it their all. Such as duking it out with girls from all over, America, Britain, Russia, to finally the MC's older sister. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that was enjoyable about this anime, was the Anglerfish dance. Katyusha was also another reason why I watched this anime, the small, but great, loli, Russian girl. She was roughly the best girl from the entire anime, but other than that, I just got sidetracked from it a bit.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the beginning part of the anime, was the training. But at times they also would be searching for Panzers. The rest of the anime, is the MC and her pals working together to fight the other countries' girls. However, I faced a problem with the anime when first watching it. A Panzer, was inside of a submarine-like boat. Just how did it get in there? And how did they get it out? That was my major problem at first.\\n\\n\r\nI do believe they might have probably cut a hole through that part of the boat/submarine, and crowded everyone in the Panzer. But if you think about it, that's logically impossible. We're talking about steel like, that can only be melted of sorts. Unless they had a blow torch and did all that, it would be logically impossible to pull that Panzer out of that Submarine. My memory could be off, they probably did say how to get it out of there, or they probably showed the way they got it out. But seriously, they just say \"WELL WE FOUND ANOTHER PANZER\" and it was never mentioned of again.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime style is also unique, but it's that part of where you notice (If you watched Strike Witches) that the anime itself was also made by the creators of Strike Witches. So this intrigued me, and I continued to watch it, and it was alright.\\n\\n\r\nThe story could use a bit of work. Yes, I understand \"B-B-BUT THEIR SCHOOL FACING ULTIMATE EN-\" We already went through that before. Most anime could have done that before Girls Und Panzer. I get it. But I thought the end was a bit cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the ending. We already have enough anime with the whole \"GOOD ENDING.\" They could have done the whole \"NOPE, BAD ENDING, SCHOOL DED\" and then done something for a 'good' end at least. But oh well, most anime use the overused \"NOPE, GOOD END IS BEST.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, sure they were understandable at times, but most of them weren't, because we only got like. One moment of their back story. Most of them however, we had no back story at all. An example, Katyusha. We had no back story from her at all, except from learning \"WELP, SHE GOT IN THE FINALS CLOSE ENOUGH TO MC'S SISTER, GOOD BEST CHARACTER.\" Out of all the characters, Katyusha, the Britain girls, and some others were good. However, most of them. You had no clue what they were doing at all. And had no clue whether they were truly important to the plot or not. And the voices of the characters of the anime are good enough, I think they fit the role of the characters, which is why I think they suited the characters surprisingly well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment now is quite hard. At times I would often get bored from watching the anime, but it was kind of killing you while waiting for the anime episode to end. Even when you were on the last episodes, you would be wondering \"OHGODWHO'SGONNAWIN?\" even when you would know the MC would win. It's not that shocking, but it was an alright anime. Some moments felt not needed, most moments felt needed as well. But that's the enjoyment you can get out of an anime, most likely.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the sound. The sound actually sounds very good during this anime, the tanks moving, the ammo being shot from the tanks. It's all very good. It's not the best, that's for sure, but it's still good. At times you can hear them walking also, and I think that really counted for the time inside of the Submarine. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the things I reviewed. I enjoyed this anime anyways. I enjoyed some of the characters, mostly Katyusha. But I really do know that some of the things could have been worked on. But I give the anime an 8.1/10. It's not the best anime, but I would recommend it anyone to watch it at least.",

I know they are on Junior High, but it doesn't matter, as long as their appearances were enough to drag me all the way to the end!\r\nGirls und Panzer literally blows up any expectations and shows the route of a glorious way, consisting of friendship, team work and lots of commitment. Of course that a huge amount of armoured vehicles are introduced in the few 12 episodes aired on television.\r\n{STORY - 10/10}\r\nIt all starts with this \"art of piloting tanks\". Sensha-do is a sport played only by girls and women, exploding their deepestdesires for adrenaline and letting them feel what it looks like to pilot those wonderful machines.\\n\\n\r\nOur main group of protagonists, led by Miho Nishizumi, begin tracing the brighest way for Ooarai Academy. A previous accident may have destroyed all her will to get inside a tank again, but meeting some amazing friends would add both joy and excitement on every match she entered.\\n\\n\r\nA team able to get bigger and better, with more comrades and mobile weapons. A perfect and innovative plot, filled with intense and realistic battles, plus a heartwarming story of overcoming critics and despise... It's gorgeously unique and amazing!\\n\\n\r\n{ART - 10/10}\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to visual aspects, GuP uses everything on its range to be just the most authentic anime I've ever saw. Top-notch 3-dimensional renderization and animation direct all spotlights to the stars from these series: the tanks. At least 30 highly detailed models debuted in here, including remarkable pieces from german, russian, francese and japanese ground armies. Non-stop gunfire, combined to the smooth movimentation boost the conception we get from these beauties even more!\\n\\n\r\nBut what it would be from those battles without authentic, distinct open enviroments, featuring all the unique aspects from their respective nations? England, Russia, Japan, US... Every academy choose the most suitable fields, based on both fighting style and tank nacionality.\\n\\n\r\n{SOUND - 10/10}\\n\\n\r\n\"Close-to-life\" SFX is an undeniably important issue when looking for the best experience. Track movimentation, recharging, shooting explosion and penetration sequences, among many other actions require some attention to be as realistic as possible. Watching this show is like playing a latest generation videogame. Imersive effects, combined with the outstanding visuals, is all you need to literally feel inside those tanks. Way too impresive to put into words...\\n\\n\r\n{CHARACTER - 10/10}\\n\\n\r\nSuch attention on tanks that I forgot the best part: girls... GuP takes advantage from this section, making use of a huge cast, 99% composed by female Junior High students. Our main protagonists are united through sensha-do and Miho Nishizumi commands the whole army of five tanks that represent Ooarai Academy. Each one featuring a different team with its own personalities, skills, styles and tactical abilities.\\n\\n\r\nEvery new episode introduces more and more characters, until we reach the last one after hearing more than 30 different voices. What really impressed me was the fact that most of them are crucial to develop its whole plot.\\n\\n\r\n{ENJOYMENT - 10/10}\\n\\n\r\nNothing less than perfect, I became amazed with such variety from both tanks and characters being presented on a 12-episode anime. This is all you need to start loving those engineering masterpieces and learn a bit about them!\\n\\n\r\n{OVERALL - 10/10}\\n\\n\r\nReceiving the highest grade possible proves the anime can't be compared to any other work ever made. Just like when you develop a videogame, producing a good adaptation from an even better original work is no easy task. Giving life to every combat saw in the manga and getting a final result from this level was enough to make my mind up. Definitely, the most visually beautiful anime I've ever saw and also one of the best shows I got the chance to know. Said that, \"panzer vor!\".",

            "content": "The premise of \"Girls und Panzer\" was what lured me in to watch the anime in the first place. On paper it seems so ridiculous, that you kind of want to see how the studio responsible actually handles it.\r\nTo sum it up quickly, Girls und Panzer is a lot of lighthearted fun, which actually manages to come to a suspenseful and entertaining, if a bit predictable, conclusion. If you're looking for an anime where you can switch your brain off, just laugh along with the cast and enjoy cool tank battles, then this is definitely going to be for you.\r\nThe story of the anime isnothing to write home about. It is a classic case of \"Underdog rises to the top\". Unfortunately, I have to pick a bit on some parts of the story, because alongside the main plot, we are introduced to some side stories that revolve around a few of the main characters personal lives. These had some potential to make the viewer care a bit more for the characters, but instead they end up adding nothing more than pointless melodrama. They have no real effect on the story nor the characters and their development and instead end up feeling pointless and a little bit like filler content (Which is impressive in a 12-episode long anime).\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the anime is one of its finer points. Production value isn't through the roof, nor does the show have a super-unique style, but it is packed with solid animation and excellent 3D segments. The tank combat is a joy to watch in every single episode. If you are a fan of tanks in general, I can guarantee that you will enjoy seeing many of the old classic vehicles animated into action (Even if some of the tricks and stunts they pull off are practically impossible).\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is another thing that helps drag Girls und Panzer up from the land of mediocre anime. It manages to incorporate catchy military marching tunes from across the world, such as \"Panzerlied\", \"The British Grenadiers\", \"The US Field Artillery March\" and the Russian-inspired \"Katyusha\". All of these are catchy and fitting of the show and their respective factions.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Girls und Panzer are cute and that is about the extent of it. With the anime being as short as it is, it doesn't leave a lot of time to develop the cast, considering how many tank crews that are present. The main cast are of course given a bit more development time, but the only character really worth mentioning being something out of the ordinary is the tank-crazed Yukari Akiyama who has an absolutely infectious personality.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Girls und Panzer boils down to being an anime about \"Cute girls doing cute things\"... In tanks. As such it is impossible for me to give it super high score. The only thing out of the ordinary here is the premise and at the end of the day, with only 12 episodes, the premise alone can't drag it all the way up. At the same time, Girls und Panzer is cute, entertaining and suspenseful when it wants to be, helping it stand out in the vast sea of \"Slice of Life, Moeblob, School Yard\" anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that said, we come to the conclusion of this review, with Girls und Panzer receiving a very solid 7/10.",

I do not have to make this up.\r\nThe tank 3D graphics are decent and do not detract from the anime qualities of the show in that little attempt is made to fake anime aesthetics here.\r\nA wise choice.\r\nOne the whole there is little to complain about apart from the story:\r\nPrologue aside there are dramatic and unexplained variations inthe performance of crews and tanks bordering to plotholes and the progression of the overarching plot also becomes exceedingly predictable with time.",

            "content": "\"Girls und Panzer\" is one of those really fun anime that let's you know exactly what you're getting into right out the gate. Hell, the title alone tells you all you need to know, \"Girls and Tanks\". If that premise doesn't sound awesome to you, well than you have no sense of fun. Or you just a bit skeptical on how a show combining cute moe girls and WWII tanks, could ever work.\r\nWell, maybe I can help to pique your interest.\r\n--\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story of GuP centered around a form of tank practice combat known as \"sensha-do\", in order to teach young women how to primand proper caretakers and wives. One of these young girls is Miho Nishizumi, who had previously quit sensha-do and moved to a new school in order to find a new hobby to replace it. However, for reasons out of her control, she is forced to join her schools newly re-established sensha-do club. Now with the help of some friends she'll meet, she must attempt to help the school win the annual sensha-do tournament against various other academies.\\n\\n\r\nClearly, this is not your typical tournament series. The premise is what ultimately sells it here, and are what make the battles fun to watch. At the very start, the main characters are clumsily just trying to figure out how to even drive their tanks, but by the end they become masters of the craft. It's enjoyable to see what bigger and badder tanks our leads will have to fight against as the story unfolds\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, while the main arc gets plenty of focus, the sub arcs never really wrap up cleanly. They are presented, but never really resolved fully. It's one of those cases where you end up asking yourself, \"Well what was the point?\".\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe general art style of GuP is pretty standard among anime. It doesn't really deviate from what you've come to expect. The animation itself though is an entirely different beast though.\\n\\n\r\nSomething you'll immediately take notice of when watching GuP is the extensive use of CG. Now before you say what I know you're thinking, which is \"Oh god no, not anime CG.\", don't fret. The CG in GuP is incredibly well executed. It's used to give the battles a consistency that would be a massive undertaking for 2D animation, and it helps to give the tanks real weight to them. When you see a tank fire a shell, it really feels like they fired a large explosive round; the tanks rock and bounce as they move and fire in realistic ways you'd expect them too (until they decide to take some creative licence with physics, but it's anime, what did you expect).\\n\\n\r\nThe CG doesn't overtake the 2D animation though. On the contrary, the two seemingly match together perfectly, in a way you'd never expect. The result is battles that are incredibly fun to watch, and are never jarring.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of this show is definitely an area where GuP really gets to shine. The music is fantastic, with all of it catchy and fun to listen to, and to really add a cherry on top, its all orchestral military pieces, flutes and all. It really gets you excited for the battles that lay ahead.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of battles, these are great too. The sound effects used for tanks is pitch-perfect. When their treads roll, they sound heavy and lumbering, and each tank has a unique sound to it, and when they fire a shell, you feel just how loud it must be.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as voice acting is concerned, it sounds great. All the Japanese VA's sound fantastic and really natural in their roles, and characters each have a distinctive voice to them. However, I must advise to stick to the Japanese. I've tried to listen to the English dub multiple times, and everytime I quit; it's just bad, with voice actors that are clearly amateurs and don't sound natural in their roles.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what will keep you coming back to this show time and time again (besides the tanks of course). All the characters are uniquely distinct from one-another, and you'll definitely remember who each is, especially the various academy leaders.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, you'll also come to grow attached to, surprisingly, the tanks themselves. Like the girls themselves, the tanks feel like characters on their own as well, and each fights in its own unique way, making them all distinct not only in design but also in battle.\\n\\n\r\nThe one major downside on the character side of things is just how many their are. You'll get plenty of time to spend with our main girls, and even many of the academy leaders, but most of the side characters feel almost like minor's with little screen time devoted to many of them. Still, with what little screen time they do get will get you to remember them in one way or another.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nFor me, this is one of the most fun and badass I've ever seen. The characters are fun, the animation and great to watch, the music and voice acting is fantastic, and of course the tank battles are absolutely incredibly to watch\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nGirls und Panzer is a fun and enjoyable anime to watch. If not for some story issues, and if the side characters had been further expanded, this would be an easy 10 from me. However, these issues do not deter me from having a good time watching.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a show with a unique premise and lives up to that premise, then I definitely recommend GuP.",

Even the relationships that they have with their families, and their approval/disapproval towards the Senshado.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not my intention to make spoilers, so I can't say much more about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe CGI is awesome, the battles are intense and the characters are lovable.\\n\\n\r\nI gave it a 10, because IMO, a 9 is not enough for the level of awesomeness that I felt when watching to it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat are you waiting for?

For this at the very least I applaud it. \r\nThe main draw of this anime lies in the tank combat, the girls are relatively uninteresting and everything else is rather dull in comparison. The fact that they use tanks as a sort of \"Martial Arts\" tournament in itself is.....well plain stupid. I am okay with anime being over the top and ridiculous but there's a certain line that shouldn't be crossed because it won't be taken seriously byanyone older than four years old. That is when you decide to call something \"Tank-fu\" or \"Gun-fu\" or whatever the crap you're deciding to call it. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is lackluster and predictable, the art is solid, the sound is great and i appreciate the various military march songs, the characters are .... bare minimum, and the enjoyment is rather high. \\n\\n\r\n It is a strategy simulator anime based around tank combat. If you like tanks, and you like chicks riding them.... full speed ahead.",

            "content": "Pretext: I at first ignored this show when it was airing, with no intention of watching it. It seemed to me it would be targeted at military enthusiasts and moe lovers, even even though I like moe, I was afraid this would be using war and military (and by extension moegirls) in an indulgent way (like Strike Witches for example), rather than in a responsible way (C3-bu). Though, please understand that I had no idea about the actual plot, I've only seen some images at that point. Then later when I've heard bobduh mention a couple of times how GuP is a good sports animeand has nice tactical aspect to it, I decided to give it a shot. Well, and for the moe comedy of course. \\n\\n\r\nI'll start with the bad. GuP decides to completely ignore the problems of risk and injuries. And hence subsequent questioning of the sanity of the whole idea of tank battles as a sport gets ignored as well. And I'd be able to look the other way, taking it that it's simply a magical world in which the implied rule is that no harm can come to moegirls, and hence there's no need to question the safety of it all. Really, I'd be fine with it. It would result in a unique world, where details of the world aren't questioned not because the show demands it, but because it's not what the show is about. And there's our problem. Problem is that GuP breaks that consistency, and couple of times dares to use the risk of injury (and even inferred risk of death) as a plot point. Occasionally it's played for humor, like in cliffhanger between episodes 2 an 3, and hence forgivable. But later it's played dead serious as an important plot point, when it deals with the turning point event in our protagonist's past. Unforgivable offense by definition. However, luckily, even though, as expected, said thematic crops up again in the last arc, it isn't played out as a reason for serious drama or a plot turning event, so it can be at least somewhat overlooked. \\n\\n\r\nMy second problem with it is that even though it plays off as a sports anime, rather than funky SoL or absurd, it completely ignores one of the fundamental aspects of sports, and that's team balance. You can't have 7v4 and still call it a sport, you simply can't, it's ridiculous. It defies the very idea, concept and spirit of sport. It betrays all the implications that come with the idea of sport. So playing it as straight sport at that point is just as bad as asking viewers to ignore an obvious plot hole. However, I do have to give it that it does go ahead and use that situation to put protagonists in the position of the underdog, as well as using it to have more killing blows, hence more action, and make them use seemingly desperate and creative tactics, which are fun. Tactics wise, it's silliness counters the seriousness that tactic execution implies. Only in last arc are tactics fun enough to completely overshadow that problem, they're ridiculously fun and fast paced to the point where any flaws can be disregarded due to rule of cool, rule of funny, etc...  \\n\\n\r\nAll that said, characters are fun and adorable, and there are ton of them. Concept is quite original. Comedy is funny, 3D animation is plentiful, amazing and blends outstandingly well into 2D style, soundtrack is great, as well as ED. This show really succeeds in being a adorable and silly tactical action packed comedy. In last arc, it especially shines in the department of tactical and fun.",
