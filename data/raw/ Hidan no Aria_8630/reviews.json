            "content": "There was a time when I, too, had faith in J.C. Staff. I still do, actually. I\u2019m stubborn. But try as I might to cling fondly to the days gone by, to classics like Azumanga Daioh and Excel Saga, even guilty pleasures like Shakugan no Shana, it seems that J.C. Staff is relentless in their efforts to drive me away. An admirable mission, that.\r\nSo here is Hidan no Aria. I\u2019ll confess. I was excited. I have a soft spot for action harems, loathe though I am to admit it. I\u2019m one of the last cynics in anime fandom who doesn\u2019t completely loathe Rie Kugimiya (she\u2019snot bad, she\u2019s got range; it\u2019s not her fault the squeal is what sells, and everybody\u2019s got to pay the bills). Takashi Watanabe of Boogiepop and Shana was directing, and early promotional artwork looked\u2026well, not promising, but certainly not the worst of the genre. I didn\u2019t get my hopes up, but I expected the kind of show I could guiltily binge on and then tell all my friends I hated to keep up the elabourate fa\u00e7ade that I am a man of taste.\\n\\n\r\nAll this is just so you know that I gave Aria a fighting chance.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, it\u2019s bad. I mean it\u2019s really bad. Not Togainu no Chi bad, but nowadays my attention can only be diverted from erotic fanfiction and 80\u2019s movies to tear an especially terrible Japanese cartoon a new arsehole, because I like easy targets. So that\u2019s the terminology we\u2019ll settle on\u2014especially terrible. And it is. It is a new low for J.C. Staff.\\n\\n\r\nBut I\u2019ve beat around the bush long enough. Let\u2019s get to the point.\\n\\n\r\nThe world of Hidan no Aria is one where the Butei, an elite international martial organisation, trains its members at the high school level. That\u2019s right. In this world, international treaties on child labour are unheard of, and hundreds of parents see no issue with sending their children to a school where the use of firearms is not only commonplace, but required. Furthermore, the students of Tokyo Butei High\u2014quite unlike my high school classmates, most of whom, by the time graduation rolled around, had yet to master the delicate art of pissing straight\u2014perform incredibly well in this environment. Oh, but it\u2019s not just the coursework they have to worry about. Butei High students must apply their lessons to real life when they are targeted by the Butei Killer\u2014a criminal who sends high-speed Saw-esque murder puzzles after the teenage students. This individual has yet to be apprehended, as Butei graduates and all other law enforcement agents have better things to do than bother with a serial criminal with a rigidly-defined M.O. who regularly targets minors, and endangers civilians in the process. Yep.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I wouldn\u2019t still be watching anime if I had issues with suspending my disbelief, but would it really have been so hard to age the cast up four or five years, to college-age? The plot would remain practically untouched, and, really, it\u2019s got nowhere to go but up. But I digress.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the plot involves a lot of looking at girls\u2019 underwear (whether it is on their bodies or off), and some nonsense about Sherlock Holmes and other fictional characters (and at least one out-of-place historical figure) that is so astonishingly, mind-numbingly stupid that I have no words for it. Aspiring writers, hark! Don\u2019t always stick with the first idea you get, because it is usually righteously fucking ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nThe animators seem to stumble over the character designs despite the fact that they are not terribly complex. Characters are frequently off-model, and their movements are stiff and awkward. Their hair moves bizarrely, even by anime standards: when disturbed it jumps up suddenly at an odd angle and waves around for a while before jumping back into place. Fabric works much the same way. Inbetweens are practically non-existent, leading to movement that looks like jumpy cardboard rather than a fluid transition from one position to the next. Furthermore, all of J.C. Staff\u2019s recent productions have had this weird kind of Gaussian-blur layer over every frame, making the outlines blurry and subdued. The animation isn\u2019t awful, per se, but it\u2019s mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have much to say on the show\u2019s score. It\u2019s boring. The themes are fast-paced, but forgettable and generic, while most of the background music kind of blurs together. The purpose of a soundtrack is to elicit emotional response and set the mood for a scene. Aria\u2019s music is just kind of there because they had, like, way too much money and thought it would be cool to buy a composer. The vocal work is...well, you know what you\u2019re getting. Rie Kugimiya puts on the sort of performance she is infamous for, Junji Majima is a forgettable harem lead, and the rest of the cast could all switch places and I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference.\\n\\n\r\nThe real beauty of Aria (and I mean that in the most bitter, sarcastic, miserable way) lies in its titular character. Aria H. Kanzaki is evil. I really mean it. She is a special kind of sadistic, childish evil, unfettered by the cautious try-hard some authors exhibit when writing adults. She is rotten to the core. She is spoilt, murderously violent, infinitely selfish, and utterly loathsome. If she were the antagonist, I might even be giving this show a positive review. I would be forced to tip my hat to an author so skilled at manipulating his readers that he can craft a character that summons such immediate distaste in everyone. I\u2019m not a violent person, but I\u2019d say she needs a bit of discipline in the form of a high-speed baseball bat to the mouth.\\n\\n\r\nBut she\u2019s not the antagonist. She\u2019s not even an easily-overlooked secondary character. Her name\u2019s in the title. And we are supposed to love her. We are supposed to pile our disposable income on Blu-Rays and posters bearing her visage, on models of her likeness to sit precariously upon our shelves so that we can steal a peek at her plastic panties.\\n\\n\r\nAria H. Kanzaki is really the lowest the tsundere phenomenon can go. I don\u2019t have anything against tsunderes, really. In fact, when written carefully and realistically, they are some of my favourite characters. Aria is not a tsundere. She\u2019s a psychopath and a bully. She is hysterical, she is capricious, she is downright mean\u2014she is everything that might lead a man (were he so inclined) to roll his eyes and scoff and say, \u201cWomen! Am I right?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhich is a good segue into my next point.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not mad at Aria, because she is a fictional character, and that would be silly. I am mad, however\u2014frothingly so\u2014at the author. Chuugaku Akamatsu has written a character who he believes to be a sympathetic woman. The audience is supposed to watch her temper tantrums and violent fits the same way we might watch an angry child, despite the fact that Aria is more than old enough to know better. Her fits of rage aren\u2019t horrifying\u2014they\u2019re cute! This sort of behaviour is just the thing the author\u2014and, he perceives, his audience\u2014expects out of a woman.\\n\\n\r\nNow, we could say that Aria\u2019s temper\u2014and, by extension, the exceedingly childish behaviour of most of the rest of the female cast\u2014is just the author clumsily trying to write a realistically flawed character. People aren\u2019t perfect, after all, and violently temperamental women (and men) do exist!\\n\\n\r\nBut I\u2019m not stupid, and, hopefully, neither are you.\\n\\n\r\nThe author\u2019s intent matters. The target audience matters. The moe phenomenon matters. Japanese society and its views on women matter. The context matters.\\n\\n\r\nLook. I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re a bad person if you enjoyed Hidan no Aria. Do what makes you happy. I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re a bad person if you enjoy any fiction that carries some unfortunate implications in its characterisation of women, people of colour, GLBT people, or any minority\u2014it\u2019s perfectly possible for a story that is otherwise well-written to stumble a bit when it comes to political correctness (and I hate that fucking term, because it implies that treating other people like human beings should be done out of obligation and not common sense), and this is okay, as long as it is discussed. And I\u2019m not trying to take away your titty anime. There are plenty of shows that reward the viewer with gratuitous unmentionables while at the same time sporting a cast of realistic, relatable, well-written female characters. In fact, if Hidan no Aria was a good show that happened to have a horrible female lead, I might not even mention it. Well, maybe in passing.\\n\\n\r\nBut Hidan no Aria is bad, and I hate it, and writing this review feels like a weight off my shoulders after nearly five hours wasted on this garbage. So I will mention it. And I did. And I think I\u2019m done now.\\n",

            "content": "I really am trying to not become one of those cynical anime watchers who think the best has already come and never will again, but you\u2019re really trying my resolve this year Japan.  Hidan no Aria was a show that for whatever reason I had a great deal of excitement and anticipation for.  I was won over by the early pre-production artwork without knowing really anything at all about what it was going to be about or the source materials.  When I learned the seiyuu cast and the plot synopsis I was pretty sure what I was going to be in storefor.  In that sense I probably shouldn't have been disappointed at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Hidan no Aria gives us as a premise is about as generic and played as it comes.  A high school boy... sigh why is it I always have to start it with that?  Anyway he goes to Butai High School, a place where Japan teaches its youngsters to be assassins, thieves, and super powered shrine maidens.  It\u2019s like any other anime high school except the students all carry guns and katanas.  No seriously it\u2019s just like every other high school.  So from there our hero, Kinji, suitably useless and powerless Japanese male gets involved right off the bat with the more dangerous female classmates who either want his body or him dead or more often both.  Of course Kinji is able to tap into a hidden power of his own called \"Hysteria Mode\" which he enters from being sexually aroused.  Really I'm serious here.  I can't make this stuff up.  Further nonsense ensues from this point and I honestly couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of any of it from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nAs with most anime of this type it likes to throw out tons of nonsensical and contradictory terminology and other assorted garbage. While in the beginning it doesn't seem like that much of a stretch it really starts to take a turn for the bizarre after a few episodes.  That\u2019s when we start having characters assigned names from other fictional and totally unrelated content.  Such as Sherlock Holmes, Lupin IV, Jeane of Arc, and Dracula?  It\u2019s a mishmash of themes that have absolutely nothing in common with each other and make no sense when even applied to the story.  It\u2019s almost like the author of the story just picked random names from a library shelf and jammed them into his story as if they applied some sort of deeper meaning to it.  The names don\u2019t even have any bearing on how the characters act either.  Jeane of Arc has ice powers, Dracula is a werewolf, and Holmes is a gun totting, dual katana wielding loli.  Wuh?   This only further confuses an already pointless and directionless story which doesn't seem to stick to one theme for more than a few episodes before meandering off into another direction.   All in all it\u2019s bad... REALLY BAD.  Perhaps the worst excuse for a story I have seen in anything to date.\\n\\n\r\nThat brings us to the characters which really don\u2019t far much better.  Our hero Kinji is barely worth mentioning.  Seriously when are they going to just stop giving the guys in anime names or even bother drawing on faces on them anymore?  Just go ahead and give in to the otaku pervs and just complete the fantasy by having replacing them with faceless stick figures to allow them to complete their 2D on screen fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the girls the results are bad, even for a harem.  Other than Aria the other girls are pretty much unmentionable.  Aria is your standard loli tsundere.  She says all of the things you would expect of her archetype and is performed brilliant by the undisputed seiyuu queen of this type, Rie Kugimiya.  As much of a completely uninspired character or even acting performance that makes Aria up, it is Kugimiya that makes this series even remotely palatable to watch.  Sure we have seen her do this role dozens of times before but I for one really never grow tired of it.  In that sense it is a thoroughly Kugimiya type performance that is right in her wheel house and one that she completely hits out of the park.  The real question is how many people are, unlike me, totally sick and tired of it?\\n\\n\r\nJ.C. Staff is usually pretty solid with their animation and production values and that doesn't really change here.  But a lot like Kugimiya, I suspect a great many viewers are becoming weary of seeing the same damn thing over and over again.  It would be nice to see them try to stretch themselves sometimes and be unafraid to take some risks.  The one thing that really did stand out to me was how utterly silly the various girls hid their weapons.  Take Aria, who is a tiny girl with an impossibly short skirt yet somehow manages to hid 2 enormous pistols under it and yet not be constantly seen when she is not drawing them.  In addition to the even more ridiculous dual katanas she hides, under her blouse.  It seems Aria's clothes are a lot like Doctor Who's TARDIS: bigger inside than it appears from the outside.  Not that this is the first time anime has played with physics before but this really seemed to stretch the realm of believability.\\n\\n\r\nFrom an acting and sound standpoint, Hidan no Aria is very good.  As mentioned I think Rie Kugimiya was in her element and delivered a very enjoyable performance.  The rest of the cast played their parts as expected.  The music was pretty exciting and good.  I especially enjoyed May'n Scarlet Ballet.  \\n\\n\r\nI actually found a great amount of this series to be amusing, mostly because I am a Kugimiya fangirl.  As nonsensical and clich\u00e9d as everything about this anime was there was plenty of amusement to be found in watching the characters act this way.  But at the same time I am fully aware that pretty much everything else about this show is terrible.  For that reason I can\u2019t recommend it to anyone.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is bad, guys. I mean, it's really REALLY bad!\r\n'Hidan no Aria' has just about every cliche harem elements in the book. The premise focusing on a special occupation to try to be unique, the characters strip and trip randomly for fan service, violent retribution for accidental infringement, archetype heroines, obvious tsundere stuttering, ordinary high school student with hidden special powers, protagonist is surrounded by girls who are crazy about him for no reason... I can go on and on.\r\nThe core premise is somewhat interesting. It's set in a school that trains mercenaries, and the students undergo various lethal training and get credits through actualmissions. However, there are also a lot of stupid concepts going on, like all them being \"butei\" (combat detectives), the Hysteria Mode, and the fact that almost every character is descendent of a famous historical and fictional figures - Lupin the 3rd, Sherlock Holmes, Joan of Arc, Tooyama Kinshirou, Himiko, Count Dracula... it gets embarrassing to watch after a while.\\n\\n\r\nThe story consists of one improbable event after another. The character and villain's actions rarely make any sense. It gets so bad that a good guy would point the gun at the bad guy and say something like \"there's no escape now\", and the bad guy just runs without getting shot. I had no idea why this series needed to be about \"detectives\" as there were almost zero thinking going on. It's more like charge in first and see what happens next. It's also pretty absurd all the characters were carrying the gun and shoots around in the school campus, and of course, everything is bullet proof so no one gets hurt. The jokes get repetitive, with the protagonist getting into ecchi situation with random girls, and seen by one of the yandere/tsundere heroines and gets \"kaza-ana\".\\n\r\nWorst of all is the protagonist's \"Hysteria Mode\", which gets triggered from sexual arousal. This is the stupidest activation trigger I have ever heard, and serves only as a tool for fan service. \\n\\n\r\nArt in this series is decent. The female characters are attractive, though extremely generic design. Character movement is very stiff and apparently low budget, but there are some nice slow motion action scenes that it's at least average quality in terms of animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe voicing for Aria is absolutely horrible, a stereotypical tsundere voice with zero distinction. Not only that, it gets seriously annoying after a while. Other characters' seiyuu were average at best. BGM is quite insignificant, and OP/ED were average.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing in 'Hidan no Aria' that sets it apart from hundreds of other harem series. It's obvious why a certain fansub group would trollsub a series like this, and in fact, the sound effects guys in this series started trolling in latter part of this series, like inserting sheep sounds at the mention of \u300c\u57f7\u4e8b\u300d, a word meaning \"butler\" but has similar pronunciation to Japanese word \"sheep\".\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, Riko's character was extremely hot both in design and personality, and ecchi in this series was decent. It's one of those series you watch to kill time, and see how bad it gets. B-But it's not like I enjoy watching this series or anything!",

            "content": "Hysteria Mode... It's like 'Pervergy' (pervert energy) but doesn't make your hair spike up in such ridiculous proportions.\r\nJoining me for today's review and providing commentary is none other than Master Yoda. Great to have you with me here today Master Yoda.\r\n\"To pleasure with you, it is my work\"\r\nUmm.. I think you mean \"It is my pleasure to work with you\" but somehow that came out wrong... Anyways, onwards to the review!\r\nHidan no Aria, or by it's English title  Aria the Scarlet Ammo was one of the many anticipated anime this year. Heck, even some fanboy/girl even created a page for the series on facebookeven before it started airing, while other fan claim it as \"One of the Best Anime of all Time\"\\n\r\nEven Master Yoda took the liberty of contributing by subbing a few of the episodes for the series.\\n\\n\r\n\"Subbing the anime, enjoy I have...\"\\n\\n\r\nWell I'm sure you do. But I can't say much for the audience though...\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of the series is quite popular among some factions of the audience in this modern era. An academy for training Butei (mercenaries but with a code of honor). Girls falling from the sky. Strong heroines. Absurd gun fights and explosions. And last but not least, HAREM! Everything an average youthful men wants but fail to achieve due to our constricting ties to reality. The premise itself made an interesting core for the story. But the question is, did it live up to the light novel's expectations?\\n\\n\r\nArt wise, it is far from being perfect but nevertheless is sufficient to provide detail on the author's perspective of what a world that is run by secret organizations, mercenaries and assassins. I have no problem with the sound as well as the BGM composed was befitting of an action genre anime with a tint of comedy.\\n\\n\r\n\"Not if anything to say about it, I have! Seen better animation for action I have\"\\n\\n\r\nFor the last time Yoda, you can't compare your movie animation to an anime animation. That's like comparing a light saber to a banana. But gives you heartburn but a different kind.\\n\\n\r\nList of Characters\\n\\n\r\nAria H Kanzaki..\\n\r\nContrary to popular beliefs, the H in Aria's name is Holmes NOT \"H\" for ECCHI! I'm saying this for the first and last time. I mean, what parent would give their daughter the name, 'Aria Ecchi Kanzaki\"? And Holmes is spelled H-O-L-M-E-S not `Olmes. She's not a gangsta. You hear me Yoda?\\n\\n\r\n\"Your mother, word to..\"\\n\\n\r\nYou know when you mix gangsta talk and Yoda talk, it just makes no sense..\\n\\n\r\nAria is supposedly the 4th generation descendant of Sherlock Holmes. A generic Tsundere (of course will come with an iron board chest) I find nothing particular interesting about her character in the anime. She's as generic as it gets when it comes to Tsundere female lead. Ok, so that covers the Tsundere Flat Chested Girl Fetish audiences. Treating the male lead as a slave, calling him 'idiot' for no apparent reason and of course being such a huge cock blocker.  But she is, not, without some positive values. She is portrayed as strong willed and independent. She goes out of her way to prove her mother's innocence as well as following her advice on finding her \"Watson\" or in other words a partner. \\n\\n\r\nAnd thus we have Kinji Tooyama, the Watson to Aria's Holmes.\\n\r\nKinji Tooyama is conditionally weak and a coward. Oh no. Well this isn't really new. If you're a proud owner of a harem you should be prepared to be stripped of all your dignity and strength. That's the basic foundation of a \"Class II Harem\" But I said \"conditionally weak because he has Hysteria Mode! His urge to protect women causes him to awaken to his the manly and elegant side. He chooses to escape from the Butei world after his elder brother was killed performing his duty but was badmouth by the community. Thus it would take a bomb on a bike, a bomb on a bus and a bomb on a airplane to change his mind and decide to serve as Aria's partner as a Butei. \\n\\n\r\nAnd what Harem wouldn't be completed without a neglected childhood friend. Shirayuki Hotogi, she's sort of like a miko so yeah I guess that covers the audience with a miko fetish. She is  one of the very few characters that possess psychic abilities.\\n\\n\r\n\"Within this young one, force is strong...\"\\n\\n\r\nRight... So Shirayuki  is of course portrayed as the one who showers her unconditional love to our male harem lead. Which could only mean one thing. YANDERE!!! It's been a long time since I've seen a Yandere in a harem. Yanderes serves as an important mechanism in a harem.\\n\r\nIt is indeed refreshing to see someone who could do the job for me, killing the main harem lead if he becomes such a nuisance. \\n\\n\r\nSo that's it for some of the main characters in the series. Wait, I know what you're thinking.. \\n\\n\r\n\"THIS ISN'T TORADORA SEASON 3???!!!\"\\n\r\nWhat gave you the slightest idea that it was, Mr.CAPSLOCK Warrior?\\n\\n\r\n\"I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS WAS HAREM ANIME! THERE'S ONLY TWO GIRLS. YOU LIED TO ME! YOU SUCK AS A HAREM KING! STOP TRYING TO BE FUNNY! IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT!!\"\\n\r\nWell, I wouldn't want to spoil the best moments in the novel and anime so I guess you have to figure out which other girls are in his harem. But I'm telling you it's not that hard to figure out... Basically any girl who had more than 3 conversation with the male harem lead in a harem genre anime will be automatically (and magically) fall in love with him.\\n\\n\r\nSo did the anime live up to it's expectation and hype? I would probably say no. However, it doesn't mean it was a failure. The novel had great aspect and content that if utilized in the anime would make it worth while to watch. Even though the whole youths in combat, mercs and assassins, ability users concept is pretty used many times. \\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting aspect about the series is that it follows a common trend in animes is to cameo famous historical figures names as characters. Well I won't spoil to you who appears and not.\\n\r\nBut I will tell you who doesn't\\n\r\n-Georgia WashMyThongs \\n\r\n-Christy CallMahBust\\n\r\n-Napoleoni Bonerpart\\n\r\nAnd other ideas names on historial figures being girly-fied? Feel free to comment on my profile.\\n\\n\r\n\"Girl version of my name, Yodarina, it would be...\"\\n\r\nI wouldn't be interested in a girl version of you anyways yoda\\n\\n\r\nIf you like gun duels, explosions, destruction and of course a follower of the Way of the Harem, all sandwich in supposedly labelled school life type genre? then you might find Hidan no Aria worthwhile. And if you like Yoda's fansub you could also request him to sub other animes.\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\nHaremu Kingu,\\n\r\nSinging Off!\\n",

            "content": "SPOILERS INSIDE.\r\nThis is not a show you love or hate. This is a show you\u2019re bound to regret watching. It\u2019s extremely clich\u00e9d, mediocre quality and a money-maker, and above all \u2013 annoying. But so ridiculously it sometimes is amusing.\r\nStill, two things make this series for me:\r\n1.\tAria\u2019s hairpin which is sadly gone after a while,\r\n2.\tKinji\u2019s Hysteria Mode.\r\nBeyond that, there is not much to see here. But then again \u2013 what can you expect from a series that was already highly overrated by the Japanese fans even before it aired? I should probably have said otaku instead of Japanese fans, excuse me, but that\u2019s what happened, withthis series being the most anticipated one of Spring 2011 season. Why, yes \u2013 in Japan. Don\u2019t they love Kugimiya.\\n\\n\r\nStory- and character-wise, what\u2019s in it? Tsundere (but not the likeable kind, the I-have-seen-this-how-many-times-now kind) female lead \u2013 check. Male protagonist being useless 95% of the time \u2013 check. Veeeeery unexpected plot twist in early part of the show \u2013 check. A bunch of supporting characters that are there just to try to fill us in on the backstory and still fail miserably \u2013 check. Great. The two protagonists attend a mostly ridiculous school where teenagers are trained to be detectives - or rather super agents - and so far the plot has been focusing on how cute Aria is. But she is not. She is another Taiga/Louise/Shana clone created just to please the fans. There are moments when she is bearable; yet that is mostly when she is not talking at all. And the Holmes crap? I thought Lupin the 4th was quite funny, but they had to add Holmes the 4th into it. Wow, just wow. UPDATE: they also tossed Jeanne d\u2019Arc in. I thought that nothing could surprise me anymore.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what about Kinji/Ry\u00fbji? The 5% he\u2019s not useless is when in Hysteria Mode, which he is reluctant to enter because it makes him act retarded. In his opinion. It does not.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals J.C. Staff did just reasonably. I like how the opening and ending sequences are animated, plus the fights - the fights are great eye candy. The rest is not something we have not seen yet. I\u2019m just quite surprised that they do not animate the protagonist loli particularly well. Low budget? No way. Laziness? More like it. Little can be said about the art of \u201cHidan no Aria\u201d. It\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s just nothing spectacular, and given how new anime can look, I\u2019d call it a tad disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a different story. Good background music, that\u2019s certain; OP and ED, just fitting for this series, are average; but for once I must complain about the voice actors. Rie Kugimiya \u2013 if it was not for Kagura, she could disappear completely from the face of Earth. She does not create her characters. She IS them. Very, very disappointing. She brings nothing new into yet another show. I used to like her voice, but damn, isn\u2019t it annoying. Now it\u2019s just painful. Boring, too. Just remain Kagura, that\u2019s what you do well (and Taiga, for that matter). Going on with the list: Mariya Ise was a good Stocking, but performs just typically as Riko; Junji Majima is Ry\u00fbji, end of story.\\n\\n\r\nSomehow I managed to watch the entire thing. SOMEHOW. The second half gets far worse than the first, which, frankly, is an achievement. Just do not watch it. At all.\\n\\n\r\nVery not recommended.\\n",

            "content": "Girls with guns and fiery explosions tailing behind. That statement alone should sound pretty awesome, right? ... Right?\r\nUnfortunately, this is not the case. Oh, on everything that is sacred, is this not the case. But, it's not enough to say that this is a load of crap that deserves any and every amount of ridicule that it gets; this needs to be broken down, bit by bit, to expose it for the grim piece of bloody, scarlet-colored turd that it really is.\r\nWith that said, let's begin with the opening song--the thing the audience hears at the start of every episode.\r\nI, personally, have nothing against May'n.However, this song began to get annoying after a while due to the immediate pretentiousness that it brings along. The gun and firing sound effects, the cathedral with a picture of (what I assume to be) the birth of Jesus, front-and-center, and then Aria, the heroine of the show, staring at the audience blankly in the face--it speaks for itself. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and need I remind everyone that Aria's supposed to be the main character here? With all of the sarcasm in every fiber of my being, I don't think the opening made it clear enough! There needs to be even MORE Aria! Her shooting a bullet at the audience's faces? Perfect!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, what are all of the guns about? Well, let me explain as frankly as I can.\\n\\n\r\nApparently, in our modern-day world, it's perfectly okay and only natural to give teenagers, who are still going through emotional and psychological development, a vast assortment of armaments and weaponry and virtual access to anywhere in the world. Not only that, they're also taught how to use said weaponry to great detail and are sent on missions that could potentially endanger their lives. \\n\\n\r\nAnd they're accomplishing all of this... wait for it...\\n\\n\r\n... in a Japanese high school. \\n\\n\r\nForget all of the legal trouble that would cause, how something as ridiculous as that would even get off the ground, and even the idea that such a thing may be better-off in the hands of ANYONE older by just a few more years; just use your suspension of disbelief, everyone!\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode starts us off with the usual Kyon-type character, Kinji Tooyama, who isn't really the main character, but supposed to simply act as support. What is his aspiration for the future? Why, to live a normal, everyday life! Wow, really pushing the limits of characterization here, aren't you, J.C. Staff? I can't wait for him to live out his everyday--no, wait, he gets attacked by the villain of the show before the audience actually gets to know him. Pfft, so much for his goals!\\n\\n\r\nBut, when he thinks that he's nearly dead meat, stuck in a death trap that will surely cost him his well-being, there goes the true heroine, Aria H. Kanzaki, to save the day! And this is pretty much the only time that she gets to be cool before becoming the laughing stock of all that is \"tsun.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhy? Because the Kyon-type character gets a raging hard-on from seeing Aria in her underwear after saving him and becomes the actual hero, stopping the baddies because he's too cool for school. Really. That happens.\\n\\n\r\nKinji monologues later that he has a special ability known as \"Hysteria Mode\" that actually makes him an instantaneous, top-ranked assassin everytime he gets a boner; I'm not even joking. This happens quite a lot throughout the series because Kinji just can't keep it down, and nearly all of the female characters lose their dignity to this because it's the only thing that makes him worth anything in this show.\\n\\n\r\nHey, it's not like this could be Black Lagoon or Kara no Kyoukai where a woman kept her dignity, was a central character AND completely awesome. Come on, Hidan no Aria! I don't think there are enough breasts flopping around or widescreen panty-shots for the audience!\\n\\n\r\nBut, wait! I've spent all of this time talking about Kinji! What about Aria, the shining, tsundere selling-point of the show?\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's really all there is to her. Aria is a tsundere to the nth degree. She even initially calls Kinji her \"slave\" and lives with him, very similarly to ANOTHER show made by J.C. Staff. Heck, she's so tsundere that she becomes unlikable mere seconds after she speaks because of how much a squealing, raging runt that she is, and her gimmick is that she will constantly fire her guns at Kinji while screaming at him that he's either a pervert or stupid. The girl even admits that she doesn't have any friends. Hmm, I wonder why!\\n\\n\r\nOh, and I nearly forgot to mention that the show tries to be cute by adding in references to fictional detective characters, such as Lupin and Holmes, stating that the \"H\" in Aria's middle name stands for \"Holmes\" and that she--a whiny, putrid, pink-haired good-for-nothing--is his descendant.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by \"good-for-nothing\", I mean it. Aria is supposed to be a top-ranked assassin--even given the nickname \"Aria the Quadra\" for her use of four weapons--and yet, she's always needing saving, doesn't have any regard for human life other than her own, and has the attitude of a spoiled, indecisive, quickly-amused child.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is she regarded as the \"best\" again? Why is everyone putting the most difficult missions on her shoulders? Why couldn't the crazy world that this story encompasses just trade her in for a better lead character?\\n\\n\r\nOh, yes, I almost forgot BECAUSE MERCHANDISING DEMANDS IT.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention, the audience, as does Kinji, is clearly supposed to find her physically appealing, too. Sorry, but personally, I can't find a hateful, loathsome numb-nut attractive. I'd rather go with the blonde chick who's into eroge and frilly dresses that also appears in this show, thank you.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, when it comes to the plot itself, it's not even anything worth sneezing at. Many of the plot-twists are those anyone could see coming from a mile away, the characters also pull-off stunts that are near-impossible (if not, completely impossible under human conditions), and some characters appear only once or twice for plot-convenience and are never heard from or seen ever again (i.e., Reki, Jeanne d'Arc, etc.). There are even some points in the story that are barely touched upon, such as the supernatural powers that come forth numerous times.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is bland and one-dimensional, and the animation is typically stiff all of the time. The soundtrack is completely unnoticeable for the most part, save for the opening and ending themes, which are simply okay at best.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, without giving too much away about the plot, this was painful--just downright painful. It has a plot and setting that would make Swiss cheese blush and horrible characters that are unsympathetic, stereotypical, and--more than often--outrageously annoying; not to mention, a pretentious presentation of nothing special that is of a (hopefully) dying breed.\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone else managed to sit through this garbage until the end (like I did), they deserve a medal. I can only hope that with such a low bar set, J.C. Staff will make their upcoming series, Kamisama no Memochou, an aspiring improvement. \\n\\n\r\nPlease don't bother twiddling your thumbs with the possibility of a second season, J.C. Staff; otherwise, I fear the worst--that everyone will just stop caring~",

            "content": "*Updated on May 30, 2011*\r\nMost of us can recognize tropes and cliches from a mile away, well consider this the picture book for tropes and cliches, which you can look all you want and if you've seen this \"book\" before, it won't be much for those whom seen it already, despite the fact it's one of those books where you can hide a gun in.\r\n*The first review is a first episode basis review, after that it's the real deal.*\r\nEPISODE 1 REVIEW: It starts out with a teenage boy named Kinji riding his bike at ludicrous speeds that would make bmxers envious appears to be chasedafter right off the bat by a...? \\n\r\nA segway armed with an uzi and a speaker attached to it? Weird. \\n\r\nBut at least there's a better reason for him to speeding the way he is, there's a bomb under his seat, literally, and it is set to blow up if he lowers his \"Speed\".\\n\r\nLucky for him a young, long haired, flat chested (Whom's breast will be the butt of many ecchi jokes no doubt) girl named Shana! Er...Taiga! Oh wait, Aria, who comes to his rescue with CG gunfire.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is what happened before any of this; the main character is getting ready for mercenary school (With guns, bullet proof vests, and all sorts of cool shit) while listening to his hormonal friend cry about everything the main character does or say making her instantly annoying (While the main character tries his best to keep a \"whatever man\" attitude), but she has big boobies and all is forgiven.\\n\r\nMeanwhile a teacher at said school is giving out an introduction to a class about the school and mentioning a criminal who is out killing the students (The teacher really doesn't seem bothered by this so the adults in this anime probably don't give a shit).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime then fast forwards back to where it left off and the two characters are in an awkward sexual position and the main freaks out and takes the chance to check out his companion who has issues with her bodily proportions whom also freaks out accordingly.\\n\r\nBut the antics come to a close as a pack of blood thirsty uzi segways starts to shoot up the place, but unfortunately for the segways the main character has the ability to abruptly swap out his character for a total badass who then, after chasing the segways away with CG animation gunfire, starts putting the moves on Aria who he thinks is a middle or elementary schooler (Who'd blame him? and creepy), but of course she's in high school (Obvious as hell)!\\n\\n\r\nAfter that the main character proceeds to school while nonchalantly explaining that his family genes is the reason he can swap to a more fun character to watch called \"Hysteria mode\" (Oh I see, it makes sense now, I guess?), then when he reaches his homeroom, Aria is there and everyone calls them lovers.\\n\\n\r\nAfterwards Aria moves in with him out of the blue, the end.\\n\\n\r\nMy obnoxiously massive sarcasms aside, this anime has many routes it can go judging off the first episode, but many of those roads may cause a severe case of dejavu for many viewers who at this point couldn't care less about another ecchi or harem anime, but for those who don't know the tropes and cliches or feel comfortable watching familiar elements will most likely enjoy this anime the most.\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nREAL REVIEW\\n\\n\r\n*I'm spoiling a lot, but frankly, I don't give a f**k*\\n\\n\r\nWhat's popular isn't necessarily good, but what's good isn't necessarily popular, Aria painfully falls into the former.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: J C has made some of the most popular anime out there, Shakugan no Shana, Toradora, Azumanga Daioh, and Toaru Majutsu no Index are all great examples. So obviously they want to continue the trend train with another runaway hit, right?\\n\\n\r\nWell this is the good example of \"Animate whatever random light novel that's out there, no matter what it is,\" syndrome, which is now common for many animation studios.\\n\\n\r\nToo common for J C unfortunately, my guess would be that J C took one look at the titular character and thought, \"Hey, she's underdeveloped physically, she's flat chested, and has long hair! By god, she's like the last couple of girls we animated, and even the novels she's in are popular! Let's animate this!\"\\n\\n\r\nWell, let me put my syndrome in this way: it's kinda like the pokemon games, it gets staler and staler with each and every game, same ole same ole.\\n\r\nUnlike the required updates for the pokemon games though, the anime J C puts out is lesser quality for this one, even Shana (An anime that's over 5 years old now) looks noticeably better than Aria, an anime that started in early-mid 2011, which anyone would easily be justified to call it lazy.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's look at the story now, that always compensates any lack luster animation, right?\\n\\n\r\nEhhh, it starts out being nothing special in the least, main male character starts to bond with Aria by doing small stuff like looking for a cat, or going on a date, though it was more babysitting than anything else. Though the male has his unique (Yet random) character trait that literally changes his entire character from typical main male lead who's just a tool for the ladies to mr suave lady killer bad ass, which is quite refreshing for that role... but he doesn't do it enough and just leaves you feeling more desired, though if it did happen more, the anime would just be a full on harem because he has to be (sexually) excited in order for it to happen.\\n\\n\r\nBut the on going plot has to do with a criminal called the butei (Butei, sounds a lot like it's pronounced \"booty\" in english, obviously not a lot of thought was put into this name decision) killer, who arranges EVERY life or death situation like the movie \"Speed\" by hijacking vehicles from segways to planes and setting bombs all over the place, doing it once was good enough for people to smile at and say \"It's like that movie, that cool,\" but three more times? With each becoming more ridiculous than the last, like it's trying to out do it's self.\\n\\n\r\nThen the anime immediately train wreaks by episode 4.\\n\\n\r\nBy that I mean character twists in that episode are embarrassingly ridiculous, one of the characters, the culprit (Who barely gets much screen time, that on top of her weak motives for doing the crimes) reveals that she is the descendant of Lupin, then reveals that Aria is the descendant of Sherlock Holmes\\n\\n\r\nSherlock Holmes vs Lupin, let it sink it and just try to convince yourself that this doesn't sound stupid in the least.\\n\r\nThere was absolutely no sign of Aria's relation to Holmes. 100% completely out of the blue, and for no good reason for either character, with only Aria's middle initial and a silhouette of Sherlock himself in the opening animation as lazy hints clues, all the while it abruptly ends the first main story.\\n\r\nIt's such a bad twist that even M. Night Shyamalan himself would facepalm.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for some reason they start treating the whole thing like they solved an actual case... Seriously, at the end of episode 5 one of them says case solved out of no where, which was just damn stupid of them to say because the criminal reveals herself to them and even runs away as well, what the hell has been solved? My limit towards nonsensical bullshit?\\n\r\nShe could honestly continue to rip off that movie to still cause mayhem and just because they know who she is, doesn't mean they can stop it, she did it four time or more and she can continue to do it again without anything to worry about, another person could just take over for her because that way of hijacking doesn't look hard at all to pull off.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of the culprit, she herself is the most ridiculous and nonsensical person of the whole bunch.\\n\r\nFrom revealing secrets to just seemingly making up whatever bullshit she wants, it'll just make you groan with irritation.\\n\r\nNot to mention that she performs feats of sheer nonsense, to using her hair as a weapon with no explanation until episodes later (Even the most mediocre shonen series would at least explain at the moment for whats happening in the context of it's world), to using her own clothes as a parachute.\\n\\n\r\nRidiculous, typical, looks cheap, and rehash, I'm sure there's more words to describe the mediocre anime that is Hidan no Aria, but that's just enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: The characters designs are really uninspired and just unfortunately are too similar to many of JC's past productions. \\n\r\nTo be honest, Aria looks exactly what would a cross between Shana of Shakugan no Shana and Taiga of Toradora would look like, just a shana with green hair.\\n\r\nThe animation is good, but not amazing, though I would be lying if I said the gun fights weren't exciting, but then again I've seen them done better (Little assassins, a famous outlaw, and an iconic hellish vampire comes to mind).\\n\r\nDuring many of the gun fights, CG animation is used, but I'll leave that to subjective views.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The Tsundere queen repraises her role once again, and that's the only thing really noticeable, the opening is alright and ending sounds great, but leaves no impression.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Decent animation, outside of the CG stuff I mean.\\n\\n\r\nMixed:\\n\r\n+/- Rie Kugimiya voicing another tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Retarded plot.\\n\r\n- Cliched like you wouldn't believe.\\n\r\n- The whole cast of characters are nothing more than the generic rip offs that are generic rip offs.\\n\r\n- Half the time the anime makes no sense.\\n\r\n- Episode 4, seriously that episode is bad from start to finish.\\n\r\n- Rehashes too many of it's plot devices.\\n\\n\r\nYou really can't blame me for reading too far into the anime, and it is kinda entertaining in it's own way, well it's stupid as entertainment (You can play a nice drinking game for every stupid element to help you get through it).\\n\r\nYou can say it's a whole new Shakugan no Shana, but the story is just too incompetent to even make that statement, even Aria herself has no redeeming qualities.\\n\r\nI'm sure they could've redone the story in a way that would make more sense, plenty of anime companies have done so, but this one is just an obvious cash in.",

            "content": "Not the best anime, but Hidan No Aria was to me an enjoyable one, and since it is highly criticized, I decided to write a review.\r\nThe background of the story is attractive, I mean, studying in order to be able to fight criminals sounds nice, and it leads to some nice action scenes. Although the plot isnt that convincing, it is not a boring one. The beginning of the scenario is a commonplace, it starts with a highschool student, at the beginning of yet another year. The highschool not being seen as a true highschool, it can help to forget the number of anime possibilyseen starting like this.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it is a recent anime, so it is pretty good overall. For the soundtracks, the openingending, I found them pretty catchy (the singer for the opening is May'n, also known for the opening of Accel World), especially the opening.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, the part that contributes the most (as well as the storyline) to Hidan No Aria's bad reception, the characters. Basically, the story revolves around two main characters, one guy (Kinji) and one girl (Aria), a tsundere. Obviously people who dislike the basic concept of tsunderes will probably dislike this anime, since there is a non negligeable part of it around her. She has everything to fits the cliche, she is even voiced by Rie Kugimiya, so your point of view will also depends if you got bored of her tsundere voice or not. Kinji, on the other hand, is less of a stereotype, and is entertaining to watch. He displays ... quite a unique trait. \\n\\n\r\nSo, overall, this anime is more of a good distraction than a breathtaking anime, but still, isn't that the point of animes? From my point of view, if you are fine with tsundere/gun or sword fighting, give it a try, in the worst case you'd lose an hour or so.",

            "content": "As I\u2019ve watched this 12 episode anime (with one episode to go), the title itself was good, and the comic aspect is also good especially when it involves the muchacho (Kinji) getting his ass kicked by Aria. This anime follows the same arc of girl comes into boys life and messes with it, however there are stuffs in this anime that doesn't fit, so I'll describe it through my ratings:\r\nStory: fair 6.\r\nAs I've mentioned this anime follows the same arc as that of girl comes into boy's life and messes with it, ok, so the chiquita (Aria, the main female lead) comes into Kinji's lifeas she mentions, she's in search of a partner and finds it in the muchacho (Kinji the male lead) who already made his mind to leave Tokyo Butei High School on the next school year. As the plot goes the chiquita needs him for his special ability and help her to prove her Madre's (the female lead's mother) innocence\u2019s. However as the anime goes on until it\u2019s final episode, things are getting a bit messy, from the muchacho being happy co\u2019z he\u2019s gonna be freed from the Chiquita after one successful mission, only to agree to be her partner a.la Sherlock and Dr. Watson, to protecting Shirayuki and eventually being part of his household and to forming up an unpleasant alliance with the conniving \u201cButei Killer\u201d Riko in the last 3 episode of the this anime. Also, aside from action, school and comedy, additional genres started to add up like ecchi, martial arts, magic and supernatural. I kinda doubt if the existence of the EU and its members would end in the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so far the way the characters were drawn have resembles that from \u201cKore Wa Zombie Desu Ka,\u201d however, the illustrator\u2019s concept of Aria is too awkward, there were scenes  were her pigtails are longer that her body, and the illustrator\u2019s idea of arming her with 2  M1911 Colt pistols and 2 katanas doesn\u2019t suit her very well. As for the rest of the characters drawn, I don\u2019t have much to comment.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nnothing much to say her.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I really am disgusted with the author\u2019s preference of using names of prominent characters both fictional and real life in relation to the cast of this anime, in fact it is even insulting to the authors and families of these prominent characters, such as Sherlock Homes, Arsene Lupin and even to the historical figure like Genghis Khan and Minamoto no Yoshitsune . So let me discuss each of main cast:\\n\\n\r\nKanzaki Aria Homes- So, in this anime she\u2019s an elite Butei \u201cS\u201d rank with a \u201cQuadra\u201d title under  her belt, also she\u2019s a 4th generation of the Sherlock Homes clan. Ok, enough of that, the thing here is, unless Sherlock Homes did went into a relationship Irene Adler, somewhere in the late 19th century (my estimate would be in 1887 to 1905) then she would have not be the 4th generation but a 5th or 6th generation of the Homes clan, her character is simply a complete opposite of what Sherlock would be, she would be considered as a \u201cBlack Sheep\u201d of Homes legacy  and if Sir Arthur Conan Doyle were to read or watch this anime he\u2019ll be very pissed.\\n\\n\r\nTooyama Kinji- he does as what is expected of being the muchacho in this anime with a harem genre, he doesn\u2019t know what to do with them (his harem) except get his ass kicked. Now, now, so what gives about this muchacho? The author of this anime/manga have given him a disorder called \u2018Hysteria Savant Syndrome\u201d somehow the author just picked up some random psychiatric terminology and put them together without even knowing what it is, making him a complete idiot, the terminology itself are compose of  2 words that are an \u201cOxymoron,\u201d so let\u2019s identify the 2 psychiatric terminology: \u201cHysteria\u201d \u2013 is defined as an unmanageable emotional excess due to over whelming fear that may be cause by multiple events in one's past that involved some sort of severe conflict. And \u201cSavant\u201d - a rare condition in which people with developmental disorders have one or more areas of expertise, ability, or brilliance that are in contrast with the individual's overall limitations. The muchacho doesn\u2019t have any of those and the author should have just stick to \u201cMultiple Personality Disorder\u201d co\u2019z that\u2019s what he has.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRiko Mine Lupin  the 4th \u2013 according to info she the 4th descendant of Arsene Lupin, here the author  obviously took the concept of  the anime  Lupin III and made it look like that Fujiko Mine another character from the same anime had finially made it out with Lupin himself  and the end product is Riko. Riko\u2019s  character in this anime is more of being a conniving, manipulative and street smarts  as Fujiko Mine, her  Madre (mother), however she doesn\u2019t have the wits to pull a heist  like her father,  another thing about her, is that one can\u2019t tell whether or not she has feelings for the muchacho or was she just using him for her  whatever plans she has for the muchacho, the moment she reappears on the 9th episode it is mentioned that she made some kind of deal with the school \u2026.you know, when a criminal make a deal with the prosecutor it always doesn\u2019t mean a get out of jail ticket, there are a lot of factors that a prosecutor has to consider. And, as nauseating for me to say, the author of this anime just has no idea as to how deals like that work for a criminal who wish to cooperate. I haven\u2019t read the actual writing of Maurice Leblanc but according to info Arsene Lupin is not only a gentleman thief, but is also a womanizer, so there will be a lot of 4th generation of the gentleman thief\u2019s great grandchildren roaming around. Like Aria, she is can\u2019t be the 4th generation of the gentleman thief, she would be instead be the 5th generation and not the 4th generation. Lucky for author of this anime and Lupin III anime that   French writer Maurice Leblanc who conceptualize the gentleman thief has long pass-away otherwise they\u2019ll be looking at a law suit.\\n\\n\r\nReki \u2013 Ok, now this character even get\u2019s weirder, she armed with a   Dragunov sniper rifle which nearly every special op would shy away from and according to info she\u2019s a descendant of  Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Genghis Khan\u2026\u2026..seriously , another historical name dropping by the author. Definitely no respect for the historical figures, co\u2019z there is no way that these people who even see each other or discuss any treaties. Don\u2019t forget, that Genghis Khan\u2019s son Kublai Khan failed to invade Japan. Also nearly every one of Genghis Khan\u2019s sons are womanizers and there will be a lot of his generations roaming around Mongolia, Siberia and in China and nearly none of them will probably have no idea that they\u2019re the descendants of Genghis Khan.        \\n\\n\r\nJeanne\u2019d Arc \u2013 her appearance in the latter episode adds another genre to this anime and it becomes freakier, according to info she\u2019s the 30th descendant of Joan of Arc and just like Riko, she was able to get a \u201cGet Out of Jail\u201d ticket by making a deal with the prosecutor . Ok enough of that, so does the first Jeanne\u2018d Arc have any supernatural powers? Well, she did unite France against the English in the middle ages, but man, I wonder if the author wants us to believe that there is some kind of mysticism surrounding the real Jeanne\u2018d Arc. Then again experts theorize that Jeanne\u2018d Arc herself is suffering from some kind of mental disorder which lead some inquisitors to believe that she\u2019s a witch.  The myth that the Jeanne \u201cd Arc that was burn on the stake is not the real one but a stand-in is not new, in fact there are some nutcase cults who believe that someone did volunteered to stand-in for her to be burned in the stake. \\n\\n\r\nHotogi Himiko Shirayuki \u2013 Since she\u2019s the muchacho\u2019s childhood friend, I guess it\u2019s obvious as to how her relationship with the muchacho would go,  being a Shinto shrine maiden and being a good fighter don\u2019t go together unless she\u2019s a Taoist nun ,which she\u2019s not. I would have wish that she ends up with the muchacho, but, as always in this kind of anime, the childhood friend is always in the sidelines.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Butei High School \u2013 what about it? Info states that it is a high-school that teaches or trains kids as young as 15 -18 to become armed detectives, which by the way the author\u2019s concept of it, is full of crap, co\u2019z it kinda look like that the said institution is a \u201cPrivate Military Contractor\u201d training school, the reason is that everything mentioned what the students were doing is exactly what a PMC Mercenary does.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nWell, as I\u2019ve said the comic part of this anime is enjoyable enough, the action part, hummm, it\u2019s enjoyable as well, but, an uncensored ecchi would\u2019ve made this anime awesome.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll leave this blank\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Putting any gimmick into your average action show with romantic comedy has been a staple of a tradition for quite some time. Some succeed, and some don\u2019t. Which, in most cases, doesn\u2019t work because it is nothing more than a gimmick in hindsight. So what better way than to plaster guns into your generic romantic comedy in the title and artwork and pray that action fanatics might have some slight interest. Look no further than Hidan no Aria to fill in another entry in the bad category.\r\nNevertheless, it is not necessarily the shallow point of the spectrum in the category. For all I know, thereare some apparent intentions on becoming a straight-up action show, and it succeeds somewhat in that department. There are some impossible logic drops scattered throughout most of the action. But for a show that is this inept plot-wise, there isn\u2019t any reason to bash it any further for that reason. It wants its action to be flashy and fast-paced, so by those standards, there are plenty of interesting conceptual scenarios they put into them.\\n\\n\r\nLike any show that stars Rie Kugimiya as the main heroine and a tsundere non-surprising, there is bound to be light-hearted comedy thrown in for good measure. Now when I mention \u201cgood measure,\u201d I mean that in a haphazard way. When the comedy is right in Hidan no Aria, it is put together and hilarious to watch Aria\u2019s reactions to anything lewd. But man, when the jokes do not work, they fucking die horribly. It\u2019s not the fact the quips themselves aren\u2019t humorous, but the way they pace it together feels dragged out far too long than it needed to be. There\u2019s even one instance where Aria calls Kinji a baka repeatedly for almost 8 seconds and becomes tedious to experience.\\n\\n\r\nThese comedic interactions also falter from the fact that most of the characters are essentially just cardboard cut-out characters of different stereotypes and adds nothing significant to them. All that we can remember about them is the typical gags that were written for them. Shirayuki is the creepy childhood friend who has an intense crush on Kinji and always gets jealous whenever a girl is close to him. Then there is Riko Mine, who somehow has an attraction towards Kinji that is never given much context as to why she wants him to begin with. Indeed no amount of layers upon layers of depth could be seen in any of them because of this fatal flaw. If you want to show these girls in these positions, that is perfectly fine, but don\u2019t expect someone actually to latch onto them for just those assets.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d put some forward analysis on our male protagonist, Kinji Tooyama, only because there is something that needs to be said about protagonists that are typically written in these types of shows. We\u2019re all familiar with the general romantic comedy protagonist who gets flustered and becomes idiotic because of it. It is a redundant trope that we have gotten used to over the years; except with Kinji, he is not a character that possesses this trope. You\u2019d think that would lead to him being likable, right? Well, the answer to that is yes and no. In that, there\u2019s nothing really to him that makes him inherently riveting to watch in guiding through the plot, what little there is, to begin with. Just like the main female cast, all we\u2019re shown about him is what his role is to the story and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nUsually, I\u2019d like to start with talking about a show\u2019s plot in the first paragraph, but for Hidan no Aria\u2019s sake, I won\u2019t even give it the time of day for that honor. Not only that but it almost seemed as though the plot was very second nature to the show\u2019s intentions. Even though it looked like it wanted to based on how it tried to put in a severe tone of what seemed to have been a plot, it provides very few attempts to weave in a coherent story. The story is not only uninteresting but also difficult to follow because of the bad transitions to mindless comedic moments.\\n\\n\r\nWith Rie Kugimiya on board with a main project, it\u2019s always apparent to at least talk about the voice acting in the show she appears in. However, Aria is not one of the big highlights of her career. I say this from someone who may not be a huge fan, but I at least respect her range and energy she puts into her roles. It\u2019s one of her roles where if you absolutely can\u2019t stand her voice, Aria will definitely not turn you into a new convert for her fanbase. Her iconic \u201cbaka\u201d is probably the most thrown out in this show more than any other show she\u2019s been in so that right there should signify whether you want to stomach through that or not.\\n\\n\r\nNo expectations were any higher than medium from me when I was going into Hidan no Aria, but I was surprised to say that its negatives don\u2019t overshadow the positives too much. That, however, can\u2019t make it a recommendation by any stretch. It won\u2019t appeal to the people who want to have an insightful anime watching experience. But for the action crowd at large, it\u2019s not going to be an easy sell. If you think you can handle the screaming \u201cbaka\u201d lines repeatedly and the other nauseating character interactions, by all means, try; just don\u2019t expect much.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: C-",

            "content": "----\r\nPOSITIVES: unique background story and environment, great voice-acting, good mixture of action and comedy, great animation.\r\nNEGATIVES: stereotypical characters (especially supporting characters), possible plot-pacing and character development troubles, weak OP song, trying to fit too much (genres, characters, background information, etc.) into too short of a series.\r\n-----\r\nSUMMARY:\r\nHidan no Aria might pay small tribute to the \"girls with guns\" genre, but it's more Zero no Tsukaima than Gunslinger Girl.  Hidan no Aria, a J.C. Staff show, is almost a perfect combination of two of the production company's previous animes, Toradora! and Toaru Majutsu no Index/Toaru Kagaku no Railgun.  \r\nHidan no Aria focuses on the relationshipaftermath of a coincidental encounter between Aria, a self-proclaimed \"friendless\" tsundere S-ranked (top ranked) student in Assault Studies, and Kinji, \", a secretly skilled E-ranked student who hides his abilities in hopes of just having a normal school life and the only person able to entertain and catch Aria's interest.  Both Kinji and Aria are second-year butei (armed detectives) at Tokyo Butei High School, a school for butei training located on its own private island (much like Academy City in the Toaru series).  After seeing Kinji (voiced by Junji Majima, also the seiyuu for Ryuuji in Toradora!) demonstrate his true powers once, Aria (voiced by tsundere queen Rie Kugimiya, also the seiyuu for Taiga in Toradora!) decides she will do anything in order to bring Kinji back to the Assault Division and have him use his full abilities again.  The two strike a deal that Kinji will return to Assault on his own accord for one mission, and regardless of the difficult of the mission, he will complete it to the best of his abilities; however, Kinji silentely adds that the best of his abilities does not extend to his \"super abilities,\" since he is embarassed of the catalyst that causes them to activate.  And so their story begins... \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: (so far...) 8\\n\r\nThe story for Hidan no Aria, so far, is both unique and redundant at the same time.  This problem doesn't come from the overall ideas behind the story, like butei students, etc. but more from the generic characters (more on this below).  However if you can get over the initial feeling of seeing all these characters before in other animes, you get to enjoy a lot of comedic dialogue and situations, great actions, and the adventures and entanglements of two solid leading characters.  Hidan no Aria definitely has a lot of potential if it is executed well.  My only concern at this point is that the show is only 13 episodes long, and the main story is just about to begin after the first two episodes.  Balancing plot and character development could be tricky, and hopefully one isn't sacrificed for the other.  Hidan no Aria could be a great compact story like Angel Beats! or could fall apart with quite a bit of nothingness like IS: Infinite Stratos if production decides to focus on the harem aspect a bit too much.  Another potential problem is the pacing of the story.  While the first episode is jam-packed with action, encounters and background information, the second episode is very slow and feels like it could have been summarized in 5 minutes instead of being a stand-alone episode.  Hopefully the story will have better and more consistent pacing now that the main plot has been revealed.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\r\nHidan no Aria isn't the best animated series this season, but it certainly doesn't suffer in the animation department either.  Action scenes are slick and fluid, attention is paid to background details, and the character designs are quite nice as well.  Don't worry about seeing a lot of pan and zoom of the same frame or repeat animation, Hidan no Aria keeps it fresh.  Another aspect that Hidan no Aria tackles well is the fanservice.  While it is definitely a part of the show, the animation directors don't act on every possible chance or opportune moment to throw in a panty shot, etc.  Fanservice is only used to further the plotline of the show, so it's refreshingly done and you don't feel bombarded with it.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:  8 (much lower if you don't like Rie Kugimiya)\\n\r\nThe background sound effects and music serve the storyline very well.  They add to the action just as much as to comedic scenes.  The voice acting is superb.  When it comes to tsundere characters, no one quite gets the voice down like Rie Kugimiya (unfortunately if you are not a fan of her style of voice-acting for characters like Aria, Shana (Shakugan no Shana), Louise (Zero no Tsukaima), or Taiga (Toradora!), you might not be able to enjoy the show).  The opening theme is very generic D-list female popstar anime OP, but the ending theme, while nothing to jump for joy about, is much better.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7\\n\r\nThis is where Hidan no Aria runs into some problems.  The characters are formed out of VERY generic molds.  We have our talented tsundere, blonde loli, doting childhood friend, etc.  Basically, the girls surrounding Kinji cover just about every aspect of a harem you could look for (including a range of bust sizes, something Kinji is always keen to notice).  One definite redeeming quality though is that Kinji, our male lead, isn't being carried by Aria.  He is strong, can hold his own, and even can show up Aria in terms of skill, not having a whiny tag-a-long for the male lead is very refreshing.  Again, with 13 episodes and only  4 of the main characters introduced so far, it's difficult to tell whether there will be enough time to really develop all the characters, especially the supporting ones and also break them out of their generic molds as well.  Of course we can expect a hidden \"kick-a**\" side to each character, but will that be enough to really endear them to the viewer?\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\r\nHidan no Aria combines great animation, voice-acting, original story, comedic elements, action and the ability to keep you waiting for the next episode.  So far, it's off to a great start.  Despite some character and pacing flaws, the show is still enjoyable to the extent that most viewers will be willing to overlook any of its short-comings.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8",

            "content": "Judging from Hidan no Aria's credentials, it is a safe assumption that it is a run-of-the-mill rom-com with a tsudere at its core and a heaping helping of action. On the other hand it might be a surprise, using genre conventions to its advantage, as Toradora did. As it turns out Hidan no Aria is a surprise... a very unpleasant one. Constantly bombarding the viewer with an endless stream of cliches while throwing in ridiculous plot twists in order to \"spice things up\", this is a far worse experience than your average generic rom-com.\r\nThe show seems to be banking on J.C. Staff's previous successes. Itis directed by Takashi Watanabe, who had previously directed the popular Shakugan no Shana; plus has the voice of that show's star, Rie Kugimiya, as the show's heroine Aria. It also has Kugimiya's co-star in the massively successful Toradora, Junji Majima, as the male protagonist Kinji Tooyama. This in of itself feels like a cheap trick in order to win an audience. However, with such considerable talent, you would expect the show to at least be halfway decent.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself starts off decently enough, though quite predictable. Kinji finds himself in a life-endangering predicament and is saved by the petite but fierce Aria; a bond is formed between them as to be expected. The settings of the story are actually pretty interesting, with Kinji being enrolled in a school for armed forces, which explains why there are such heavily armed teenagers, albeit a rather silly explanation. Kinji himself has an entertaining gimmick with his \"Hysteria Mode\" which turns him from low-key and cynical to smooth-talking and arrogant. However, that is about the extent of praise that can be given, even this early into the show. Aria is the most annoying tsundere imaginable, falling straight into the pitfalls of the character type, and capturing none of its charm. Not even the queen of tsuderes herself, Rie Kugimiya, can safe this poorly constructed excuse of a character. Outside of hysteria mode, Kinji is just a typical, boring male lead. The rest of the cast is equally unimpressive, consisting of tired archetypes such as the possessive childhood friend, the stoic sniper girl, the impish antagonist, etc.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes this show a stinker, though, is the completely asinine plot. It is not just horribly written, it is actually insulting to the viewers' intelligence. Characters' motives are poorly justified, often cliche or just plain stupid. Sub-plots pop up right and left, just to come to train-wreak conclusions, or remain unresolved. The big bad crime syndicate, called the I-U, seems to be a group of gung-ho individuals who claim to be associated with each other, but show no coherent signs of being so. Really, it is more of a gigantic nonsensical mess than a plot. Most criminal of all is the shows use of historic figures and classic fictional characters as the reason behind everything; the list of names disgraced include Sherlock Homes, Arsene Lupin, Joan of Arc, and Count Dracula. All whom are concerned must be rolling around in their graves.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's technical merits are the aspect most worthy of praise. Takashi Watanabe does his damn best to try and make this dreck entertaining, and to some degree succeeds. The actions scenes are generally exciting and the comedy scenes, while hardly ever working, at least feel like there was some effort put in by the production staff. The artwork itself is bland and generic; yawn-worthy, really. The music pumps up the excitement of the action scenes, but is otherwise pretty unnoticeable. This is the high-point of the show, and honestly... it is not all that high.\\n\\n\r\nThe preview of the final episode features an in-joke, in which Aria seemingly forgets Kinji's name and calls him by Yuugi, Saito, and finally Ryuuji. Yes, this is a cute and funny in-joke for all who get it... but it is also a reminder of why shows like this are even created. It seems the modern anime fan is happy to consume just about anything, so long as it has established names attached to it. Really, why else would such drivel even be conceived?",

            "content": "If they decide to make a 2\u00ba season (they should, because the 1\u00ba season has lots of material to make a 2\u00ba) I think it will have some development on the romance area. \r\nBut still, I shall say this anime was entertaining, was it worth watching? Yes, because 12 episodes isn't that much, and the anime has its original side. Famous people references, gun / swords fight, great art and motion. \r\nBut for me, a LovCom fan, I still enjoyed the anime, but was a bit sad at the ending, because the ending its like: \"Wait for the 2\u00ba Season\"\r\nStory 8/10: The Story...a School forsome kind of \"SWAT\" students, to fight crime and escort civilians, those kinds of stuff. But the catch comes when most of them have special powers, or important grandfathers. You will get some kind of romance, but nothing special, why? Because of the power of the main character, where he gets on rampage/boss/assassin/master mode (its the best side of the story, where he gets f*cking badass) when he thinks/makes dirty stuff, or (OFC) when he looks to Aria (main female), here it starts some kind of \"romance\". \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: The art/motion its the best on the anime, you can see the really good drawn action time, the fights, the reload animation, the characters and the ambient.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: I normally don't mind about the sound, but when I do. Are on the fight scenes, I don't understand much about music, but it made me pumped while I watch it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10: Well..You have one guy that gets OP when he gets excited whit girls, one girl (secondary) that doesn't talk much but its OP :D, another girl that gets embarrassed when he thinks about dirty things, another that only loves dirty things, and for the last, (drums) a girl that wants to marry the main male protagonist. Nothing from another world. In my opinion this is a typical Harem.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: Yes, this is f*cking funny, and awesome. Nice gun/powers/swords fights. And yes, there are some echii sceens. Nothing too much. Light Etchii.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo my opinion about the anime:\\n\\n\r\n1\u00ba Watch it if you like funny/harem style\\n\\n\r\n2\u00ba If you like Light romance between 2 main characters\\n\\n\r\n3\u00ba If you want an Harem where the male makes something useful for the girls (not a useless f*ck)\\n\\n\r\n4\u00ba Its small, easy to watch, and it doesn't need to much brain effort to watch it\\n\\n\r\nThe only bad thing in the anime was the first episode, it was too GOOD, why? Well when he gets on \"Hysteria Mode\" it was f*cking badass (best hysteria mode you will see on the anime), the way he talks to the girl, the way he \"kills\" the enemy...too Good for a first episode.",

            "content": "Aria The Scarlet Ammo, a anime made in 2011 is a prime example I think, of how Anime as a whole over the course of three years has gone down hill. Sure, you can find a few here and there that stand out above the crowed, but most are mediocre and that's where ARIA THE SCARLET AMMO comes in. It might actually be lower than mediocre. \r\nThe story is so cliche and so over used, that I was totally put off by it and stayed for the characters through the last four episodes. Boy meets, girl, she likes him he might like her, other girlslike him and they shoot people. Even people who hate anime know about this kind of anime, its so over done in so many anime. Kenji himself is somewhat unique, in the sense that he has a split persona that can only be released through looking at a women's panties or bra. Typical perverted character that only becomes awesome when he is perverted! The girl, Aria from which the show is named after is also a cliche, a little bratty kid who calls every guy a pervert that looks at her and wants to pump them full of holes (a line that gets tediously old after like the second time she says it) \\n\\n\r\nThe only real development she gets is that she is a decedent of Sherlock Holmes and her arch enemy is, of course, another decedent of a master sleuth, this time being Lupin the 3rd. Throwing other characters names into the mix and calling them the great granddaughters of these guys feels like the creators of the show couldn't come up with clever names themselves so instead took the names of two of the most famous fictional characters in all of entertainment.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself skips between one bad guy after another. Not really giving much insight to who they are our what their true evil plan is, Aria and Kenji defeat them all with ease. The final \"true\" villain is so uninteresting and has so little time in the show that I didn't really care if they killed him or he killed them, I just wanted it to be done! The only returning characters are the chick that is the decedent of Lupin, who's just a stupid loli that has nothing cool to do, a sniper chick who has about twenty minutes in the whole show and a Buti with magical powers that ALSO GET THIS GUYS!!! has the hots for Kenji! But she also has no time in the show at all either. \\n\\n\r\nARIA THE SCARLET AMMO probably needed more episodes to be called an actual show. But I don't think I could of watched a full 24 or 26 episode show of this. Its just so uninteresting and boring. The music is nice, going from fast pace to melancholy drama. The opening song has a nice beat and plays a lot through out each episode. I do think once Kenji goes into hysteria mode his other persona (minus the perversion) is a slick, well done detective-esc character, who does come up with interesting ways to get out of situations. Maybe a spin off show with him instead of Aria? I'd watch that. \\n\\n",

Now that I've finished watching it I have to say this anime really is bad. It did have some very good potential but the creators couldn't quite grasp it. Hidan no Aria had a good foundation, which is a high school that changes its students into mercenaries, but even though they had a good foundation in the end they didn't build the house as nice as they should have been (I hope you guys get this analogy).\r\nThere wasa lot of foolish mistake made in this and for starters there was no story. The episode started with action right off the bat, with little explanation, then the creators decided to let the main character/narrator explain what was going on. \\n\r\nAnother mistake they made, which was really bad were the characters. There was little character development and a few of the characters for some reason had nicknames of Historic people, for no apparent reason. I honestly don't even know where the creators were going with this, but I think it was supposedly suppose to contribute to the 'story' some how.\\n\r\nI noticed while watching this, the characters repeatedly kept referring to an article that I guess the school came up with. I think it was Article 2, \"Trust your friends and help when they need it\". Lolwut, is this the best they got? I honestly feel that the creators came up with the mercenaries idea, and after that they just rushed into it. Also the whole bullet proof clothes thing really did ruin this anime. If the creators allowed wounding and blood, this would have been a whole lot better. Hidan no Aria really suffered because of the creators, the name doesn't even have any meaning!\\n\r\nOne thing I noticed some people were throwing around in they're reviews was that there was a harem going on throughout this, and I have to say I completely disagree. I feel people feel if there's even one girl that likes the main character for no apparent reason then that's a harem, wrong!\\n\r\nHere's the definition that I strongly believe in for a Harem; Harem= when 3 or more girls have been confirmed to like the main character or have a strong fascination over him for no apparent reason or a not good enough reason.\\n\r\nTwo girls liking the main character at the same time is just coincidence and not a harem, so in Hidan no Aria's case, there was no harem, there was only one girl that confirmed she liked Kinji.\\n\\n\r\nBut aside from all that, the art was pretty good, the characters were drawn well and so were the guns. The background were also drawn well, the art is probably one of the only good things about this show (yikes!).\\n\r\nThe sound was alright, the opening and ending themes could have been better. As for the voice actors, there were probably only two I felt fit the characters they were voice acting, which is Aria and Riko. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all that, I did enjoy this show. It entertained me, despite the nonsense it had. I really feel this show should be given a chance by everyone, although most people who reviewed it either said \"it sucked\" or \"it's okay\", I think everyone should give it a shot.",

            "content": "Now this anime isn't anything particularly special, but I wouldn't dismiss it easily. This is a very cliche Shana (main female protaganist is a loli tsundere with powers basically) lesque harem anime, but it has its good points too. There are a few twists and turns and the anime is kept at a brisk pace to back it up as well. \r\n The story is an albeit comicly overcomplicated world that isn't very well gone into detail. It takes place with the protaganist, who when sexually aroused changes from an introverted weakling tothe opposite in so called Hysteria Mode, extroadinary powers, control, and well basically he can do everything humanly possible. Yeah, see that target 300 yards away? It now has a bullet hole in it's center. He leaves his house with breakfast prepared by the obvious childhood friend flag character, Shirayuki Hoto, to a military school described in little detail where he then would resume training for, uh capturing criminals and stuff (bear with it, the anime gets better!). Anyways, suddenly he then gets attacked by a thingy ma bobby contraption best described as a machine gun on a scooter where he frantically tries to avoid losing his life (don't worry hes the main character he's probably not dieing in the first episode), and dadadada! (Stein's gate reference) he is saved by a myserious short underdeveloped character with bright pink hair that is safe to assume to be the Shana character of this anime otherwise known as Aria Kanazaki. He then goes into hysteria mode when fanservice is accidently given to him and he then shows off to the girl with a few impressive moves and a cool attitude. She of course gets interested in him, and the rest is history they team up, meet a few more interesting characters, have little tamper tantrums where she beats up on the protaganist throughout and the anime continues from there. 6\\n\\n\r\n        I can't say too much about the art as it is decent quality in 2010 with maybe wanting a little more on the backgrounds and perhaps some of the city strips, but otherwise it is just what the anime needed. A nice, smooth, relaxed art that is to show all of the Tsundereish things  Aria does.9\\n\\n\r\n        I liked the sound alot as well, if your a Rie Kugima fan you will probably like  the main female character. The rest of the voices are pretty average especially the main character who sounds all depressed if hes not Mr. fantastic mode. The opening(s), I don't remember if it had more than one, were great and fitted the anime well. The ending had a beautiful tone to it as well and contrasted the sunnier opening well. The bgm throughought was used appropriately, but sometimes felt you wanting more. Either way it was better that most anime of this genre. 9\\n\\n\r\n        Okay, well the characters did get a little annoying. The main guy protagonist, Kinji, is kind of a depressed guy who only slowly starts to realize what hes got (the imaginary harem none have). I have never been a personal fan of the loli tsundere chacter really but if that is your thing Aria is the eptiome of it and you will love her and the gun's she produces at inappropriate times when she is embarassed. The childhood friend Shirayuki has some pretty funny lines and is very likeable, as long as you can tolerate the relationship she has with Kinji where she literally throws herself at him. A happy go lucky girl character,Rico, is very interesting and develops pretty well as the anime goes on. My favorite character and the saving grace of this cast of misfits is Reki who is a sniper at the military school/ cop school/ everything.whatever who is a quiet shy little girl and you only barely see her start to come out of her shell, but when you do it is rewarding. In total the characters blend averagely and form a pretty varied cast, hopefully some don't get too much on your nerves.You will also join some later characters whose names I am not going to spoil, but aren't gone into depth much anyways. 6\\n\\n\r\n For some reason, despite all these flaws, I really did enjoy this anime. When there was a funny scene it was downright hilarious. I encourage you even if you don't want to watch this anime to youtube Hidan no aria- I didn't get pregnant! because its one of the funnier scenes in anime I've scene and doesn't really need to be seen too much in context. Also, I plainly enjoy watching the girls fall over a guy like this in different ways that he doesn't deserve even if it is really unrealistic, it is just entertaining, and better than I think most harem portray it. The fight scenes were pretty average and relatively short, but it did shine a better light on the characters and their personalities under pressure. Also shows that the main character's two sides in contrast rather well ( if you can stand either side that is). Either way I enjoyed this series more than I expected with the combination of awkward bits of romance, comedy, stiff battle scenes, and well fan service. 8\\n\\n\r\n      Overall this anime is a worthy watch, but I wouldn't make it a top priority, Take a break watch some TV finish that really good series you haven't had time to watch yet and when a break comes, try to fit this series in comfortably because it will be worthwhile to do so, hope you like bright pink hair and a bright red face with twin guns because you will be seeing a lot of it. 7\\n",

            "content": "Hidan no Aria ...\r\nAria the Scarlett ammo ...\r\nIn my opinion this has been a very enjoyable anime.\r\nThe story revolves around our male protagonist Tohyama Kinji.\r\nThe events that happen are in a good and logical sequence, very similar to the light novel. Also in my opninion the story of Hidan no Aria (I like the name better in Japanese) is not just an ordinary story. Yes of course, it is about a dude attending a high school, but that's not what this anime is about. Especially when you have read the light novel you know this is true. Also for the people that have read thelight novel, I do recommend to watch this anime :) .\\n\r\nSo, if you are interested in Action and Comedy you should definitely watch this anime! The balance between Action and Comedy is very well done (I think more animes should balance their genres better).   . . . (8)\\n\\n\r\nAbout sound and art ...\\n\r\nLet's just put these subjects together.\\n\r\nThe art good. But I mean, come on, who cares that much about art if you just have a nice story with good development? \\n\r\nThe sceneries are always well done, but are not really the parts you need to worry about. Sometimes the backgrounds are a little empty and need more people there, but that's all, really.\\n\r\nThe sound fits the sceneries and the voices fit the characters, which of course is always hard to decide ... I think they thought this out pretty good.    . . . (7)\\n\\n\r\nOn to the characters :)\\n\r\nThe characters are very surprising, really.\\n\r\nThey definitely are not the kind of characters you would expect in these kind of genres. But putting the expectations aside, the characters do fit the events very well and I very much enjoyed the personalities processed in the characters. \\n\r\nIn the beginning there isn't much character development, but as the story progresses also do the characters and they start to mature a little bit more after each event. This is what I liked very much.  . . . (8)\\n\\n\r\nI don't think I have more to tell about the story, sound and art and characters\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the anime and the light novel so I recommend both of them, though I know there are people out there who don't like reading :P.\\n\r\nI you really don't like reading, try the manga, that's also awesome.\\n\r\nI definitely liked them myself and told a lot of my friends, who also watch anime, to watch Hidan no Aria.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end this is all my opinion, haha. If you want to confirm my opinions you should watch the anime yourself and submit a review for other potential watchers!\\n\\n\r\nBut long story short:\\n\r\nGood anime, nice balance between genres, nice story, good art and sound, unexpected personalities and good development. Very enjoyable :D\\n\r\n. . . (8)",

            "content": "If you don't like reading and just wish to know my opinion on whether or not you should watch this anime, my candid answer would be: \"No, No, No, don't fall for the trap i did and just watch something else because Hidan no Aria is mind-blowingly bad\". \r\nYou're still here?\r\nWell then, lets get into the nitty gritty. \r\nBy the way, there will be SPOILERS HERE, I know I'm not supposed to, but I can't write a review on how bad the anime was without 'em, so TEEHEE\r\nSo, lets start with the characters,\r\nThere is the VERY average anime male(Kinji), who holds the typical traits ofan anime male, who is the protagonist, which is rare because in most anime he'd be 20 feet from the camera and is rendered blurry cause he ain't worth attention. Now, he is exceptionally normal except for the fact he has a specially ability which I call the \"boner ability\". When he achieves a boner, he basically bones all enemies and becomes super smart, super brave, and super duper duper stuff. \\n\\n\r\nThere is the short girl(Aria), who plays the average short girl routine which is embarrassed about her height and bra size, and is apparently licensed to shoot anything without repercussion because she doesn't hesitate to dual-shoot anything. Also she is somewhat related to Sherlock Holmes but it give her anything. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is the rest of the characters, few male companions of Kinji who are also very average, Riko, Hotogi, the sniper, jeanne, and vlad. none of which were important till the end. \\n\\n\r\nNow the worst bit- the story\\n\r\nI liked where the story was headed(which is why I watched the whole thing) but it ended in another direction which got me disappointed and wilted. \\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are part of Butei a school for free lance police that fight terrorists. \\n\r\n-But seeing that the terrorists are aimed at the Butei, and Butei shooting up and bombard areas just shows how they improve their society which is to say of a negative effect. \\n\\n\r\nBut never-the-less they are fighting crime, which is till ep 6 where Aria decides to use the Butei for her personal gain and try to free her imprisoned mother who is sentenced to 900 some years(no im not kidding). \\n\\n\r\nThen we find out that Riko is Lupin(which gives her the ability to use her hair like hands) and Aria is Holmes(nothing) and they must fight because fictional English books affect Japanese anime in more than just humor. \\n\\n\r\nSomewhere here Aria and Kinji meet Jeanne - Joan of Arc's relative which gives her the power of ice, which makes even more sense because history and fiction go hand in hand. \\n\\n\r\nAlso around here is when Aria agrees to work with Riko who previously hijacked a plane to kill her, (which makes sense because you would work with people that tried to kill you with a plane) to steal something that Riko wants so that Riko can testify to clear her mother and go to jail herself - a fool proof plan indeed. \\n\\n\r\nEnding- Riko betrays them attempts to kill Aria(again), then gets stopped by Butei teacher, Vlad aka. count dracula who is also a werewolf. If you are drawing a big (WTF) around here its because I did too. Anyway Riko teams up with Aria and Kinji who have memories of goldfish and forgives Riko and takes down Vlad by shooting weak points marked out in nice white paint as if he was a first boss in a RPG game. \\n\\n\r\nNow if you are outraged that I didn't mention Hotogi- screw you, she wasn't important and all.\\n\\n\r\nAlso if you thought my summary of how poorly written Hidan no Aria was somewhat confusing in any manner, then for you, watching Hidan no Aria will be like giving birth to a 30 lb. baby. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've seen many \"this anime is crap\" reviews for Hidan no Aria, and felt that I, as a person who enjoyed this show should give his point of view about it.\r\nBefore I start...\r\nI'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who enjoyed this since the average rating for this show is in the 7s\r\nThis can be seen as a typical harem anime at a few glances, which is true. However, that's not all of it. As you can predict from all the guns, this does involve a lot of (gun) fighting too.\r\nStory: I think the story line is great (note: I have no problems watchingsame things over and over). The problem might be for some people is that this is a typical harem anime with all those typical females and the \"I avoid girls\" male.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is a bit unrealistic, involving high schoolers who carry guns and swords with them during school (also note that on average, 3% of the students die during their courses (only for the harshest course, but I mean, highschoolers dieing??)) However, this slight unrealistic part of the setting really does allow all of the crazy things to at least fit in (still sticks out like a sore thumb in my opinion).\\n\\n\r\nThe second problem I had with the story is that the story is too spread apart, such as psychic abilities, a special item that artificially creates psychic abilities, and most of all, the characters (which I'll explain later)\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr? \\n\r\n1.This is a typical harem anime with all the typical females.\\n\r\n2.Setting unrealistic (which I really enjoyed)\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'll keep this short since I'm not an art critic, and I personally don't see that much of a difference of art in most animes.\\n\\n\r\nSince this anime is already unrealistic, the art does fit well with Hidan no Aria. \\n\\n\r\nBut I do see many problems with it: (naming the major ones)\\n\r\n1. Too unrealistic (people manage to hide a gun about 1.5x their hand under their very short skirt.\\n\r\n2. Again, too unrealistic (their hair moves really awkwardly in mid-air.\\n\r\n3. Many  Unnecessary ecchi moments which is not in the light novel\\n\\n\r\nSound: I enjoyed the sound, that's all I can say.\\n\r\nall the voice actors fit in with the character, especially Shirayuki.\\n\r\nI loved the OP, and I skipped the EP, so I don't know.\\n\r\nI felt that the bgms fit in with the situation, since I didn't realize of the BGM's presence until I looked back.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters itself are so good I might of rated it a 9 or 10... if not for the random historical/fictional names that usually makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Tooyama Kinji is a Butei that no longer wishes to stay as one, following an incident regarding his brother, who is also a Butei being bad mouthed by media after \"losing\" his life while saving the passengers on a cruise \"accident\". \\n\r\nHe carries this special genetic trait,\"Hysteria Mode\" that allows him to be about 30x stronger and smarter when he becomes sexually aroused, but tries his best to avoid \"using\" it(hence avoiding females). \\n\\n\r\nThe main female character, Kanzaki Holmes Aria is one of the top Buteis in the school. She is the typical tsundere, cruel character who treats Kinji as a slave and decides to beat him around when she is mad or when she sees Kinji with another girl. \\n\\n\r\nAnother important female character, Shirayuki is a shrine maiden (miko) with psychic abilities. She is a great addition to Hidan no Aria, and helps create many comedy moments. She is the childhood friend of Kinji, who basically is in love with him. She is a yandere, nuf said.\\n\\n\r\nNow the part which I mainly dislike, the naming of the characters:\\n\r\nTooyama Kinji: I'm actually fine with this, but some of my friends aren't. He is based off Tooyama Kin-san, a historical Japanese cop (I think) in the Edo era.\\n\\n\r\nKanzaki Holmes Aria: This is obvious, she's related to Sherlock Holmes. She is the Fourth Generation Holmes. The problem is that she has absolutely no deducing abilities, unlike Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n\r\nMine Riko Lupin (4th): Lupin the Fourth. I think her character fits Lupin, but the part that I don't get, is that she is sort of friends with Aria. Lupin and Holmes as best friends anyone?\\n\\n\r\nJoanne the Arc (twenty-something generation): This naming has nothing to do with the character, so I dislike this.\\n\\n\r\nIt's getting long, so I'm gonna stop here, but there are so many historical character's decendents gathered in one highschool, which makes it really awkward and forced.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I liked the anime, but I felt that the anime should of been a little more loyal to the light novel, since I felt that the light novel is better. If you enjoyed the anime, try reading the novel (not sure if there are english versions, but if you can read Japanese, go for it) and you will enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can handle all the contradictions and unrealistic things in the anime, go for it. I'm pretty sure it'll be worth your 6 ~ 7 hours.\\n\\n\r\nIf you read the whole thing, thanks!",

            "content": "It's one thing to produce an anime that turns out badly, but it's another thing entirely to produce an anime that showcases a complete lack of effort put into production. Hidan no Aria is merely but another step into failure by the largely hit or miss JC Staff, but what really manages to tick me off as a viewer is the complete lack of care and effort put into the production of this anime.\r\nNow listen. I had nothing against the initial setup of this anime, I originally started watching it (And kept doing so for who knows what reason) merely because the premise seemed tobe fun, although ridiculous. It was something for me to just watch for the shits and giggles, a guilty pleasure if you will.\\n\\n\r\nI never expected tons of depth or complexity in this anime, but I did expect to be entertained. I wanted to see an anime that would be almost the equivalent of a summer blockbuster action flick, which while certainly the highest quality entertainment out there, it still manages to be a fun little experience.\\n\\n\r\nClearly, JC Staff had other things in mind. Instead of just trying to provide straight forward entertainment, Hidan no Aria was very roundabout with its approach.  An incredible amount of the show's time was devoted completely to fanservice and the usual anime tropes. Ranging from the main heroine Aria, who is yet another Kugerie Rie voiced loli tsundere from JC staff, who does nothing but treats the half spineless male lead like a slave, to the yandere childhood friend Shirayuki who dots on the main protagonist in a severely annoying manner, there was almost no character here that felt genuine or likable. I say the male lead is half spineless because supposedly whenever he gets a boner for one of the other girls he enters \"Hysteria mode\" and changes into some super skilled fighter with an arrogant, charismatic, and overbearing attitude. No joke here either.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I feel like I'm writing about some action comedy, but the worst part about it all is that this plot takes itself fully seriously. There are several supposed \"dramatic\" moments in the series where we are expected to sympathize with each girl in the main character's little harem, especially Aria. There are several times in this series where one will be subjected to Aria's toddler tantrums because of things not going her way, and we are expected to sympathize with her when all she does is slave driver the main lead with a leash.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, even if the characters suck, maybe the action and plot is entertaining... Well one of the major facets of the plot is how these famous people in the world are often direct descendants of famous figures like Holmes, Dracula, Lupin, etc. Each of them bears their own pasts and problems, but really, it's just really, really stupid. I think by the end when you see that the Dracula descendant is a werewolf you will also realize just how stupid this plot line is.\\n\\n\r\nThe action itself is often very lackluster. JC Staff's continual budget slashing just makes the show look like utter crap. Nothing about it stands out, and there's not enough of it at all. Not to mention that tons of of the action scenes are marred by again, fanservice since our main lead needs a boner to do anything productive. For some reason he is also relegated to support roles as well. \\n\\n\r\nBut I digress. What's clear to me, is that there is a clear lack of effort put forth by JC Staff that is pervasive throughout the entire anime. The fanservice is hardly stimulating, especially when most of it is from a loli pink haired girl. The action lacks punch, and there is far too little of it. And worst of all, each and every character is an anime archetype or trope executed in a very uninspiring manner. \\n\\n\r\nIf the creators of the show aren't even trying to make me like this, why should I? \\n\\n",

            "content": "There was a time when I, too, had faith in J.C. Staff. I still do, actually. I\u2019m stubborn. But try as I might to cling fondly to the days gone by, to classics like Azumanga Daioh and Excel Saga, even guilty pleasures like Shakugan no Shana, it seems that J.C. Staff is relentless in their efforts to drive me away. An admirable mission, that.\r\nSo here is Hidan no Aria. I\u2019ll confess. I was excited. I have a soft spot for action harems, loathe though I am to admit it. I\u2019m one of the last cynics in anime fandom who doesn\u2019t completely loathe Rie Kugimiya (she\u2019snot bad, she\u2019s got range; it\u2019s not her fault the squeal is what sells, and everybody\u2019s got to pay the bills). Takashi Watanabe of Boogiepop and Shana was directing, and early promotional artwork looked\u2026well, not promising, but certainly not the worst of the genre. I didn\u2019t get my hopes up, but I expected the kind of show I could guiltily binge on and then tell all my friends I hated to keep up the elabourate fa\u00e7ade that I am a man of taste.\\n\\n\r\nAll this is just so you know that I gave Aria a fighting chance.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, it\u2019s bad. I mean it\u2019s really bad. Not Togainu no Chi bad, but nowadays my attention can only be diverted from erotic fanfiction and 80\u2019s movies to tear an especially terrible Japanese cartoon a new arsehole, because I like easy targets. So that\u2019s the terminology we\u2019ll settle on\u2014especially terrible. And it is. It is a new low for J.C. Staff.\\n\\n\r\nBut I\u2019ve beat around the bush long enough. Let\u2019s get to the point.\\n\\n\r\nThe world of Hidan no Aria is one where the Butei, an elite international martial organisation, trains its members at the high school level. That\u2019s right. In this world, international treaties on child labour are unheard of, and hundreds of parents see no issue with sending their children to a school where the use of firearms is not only commonplace, but required. Furthermore, the students of Tokyo Butei High\u2014quite unlike my high school classmates, most of whom, by the time graduation rolled around, had yet to master the delicate art of pissing straight\u2014perform incredibly well in this environment. Oh, but it\u2019s not just the coursework they have to worry about. Butei High students must apply their lessons to real life when they are targeted by the Butei Killer\u2014a criminal who sends high-speed Saw-esque murder puzzles after the teenage students. This individual has yet to be apprehended, as Butei graduates and all other law enforcement agents have better things to do than bother with a serial criminal with a rigidly-defined M.O. who regularly targets minors, and endangers civilians in the process. Yep.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I wouldn\u2019t still be watching anime if I had issues with suspending my disbelief, but would it really have been so hard to age the cast up four or five years, to college-age? The plot would remain practically untouched, and, really, it\u2019s got nowhere to go but up. But I digress.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the plot involves a lot of looking at girls\u2019 underwear (whether it is on their bodies or off), and some nonsense about Sherlock Holmes and other fictional characters (and at least one out-of-place historical figure) that is so astonishingly, mind-numbingly stupid that I have no words for it. Aspiring writers, hark! Don\u2019t always stick with the first idea you get, because it is usually righteously fucking ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nThe animators seem to stumble over the character designs despite the fact that they are not terribly complex. Characters are frequently off-model, and their movements are stiff and awkward. Their hair moves bizarrely, even by anime standards: when disturbed it jumps up suddenly at an odd angle and waves around for a while before jumping back into place. Fabric works much the same way. Inbetweens are practically non-existent, leading to movement that looks like jumpy cardboard rather than a fluid transition from one position to the next. Furthermore, all of J.C. Staff\u2019s recent productions have had this weird kind of Gaussian-blur layer over every frame, making the outlines blurry and subdued. The animation isn\u2019t awful, per se, but it\u2019s mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have much to say on the show\u2019s score. It\u2019s boring. The themes are fast-paced, but forgettable and generic, while most of the background music kind of blurs together. The purpose of a soundtrack is to elicit emotional response and set the mood for a scene. Aria\u2019s music is just kind of there because they had, like, way too much money and thought it would be cool to buy a composer. The vocal work is...well, you know what you\u2019re getting. Rie Kugimiya puts on the sort of performance she is infamous for, Junji Majima is a forgettable harem lead, and the rest of the cast could all switch places and I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference.\\n\\n\r\nThe real beauty of Aria (and I mean that in the most bitter, sarcastic, miserable way) lies in its titular character. Aria H. Kanzaki is evil. I really mean it. She is a special kind of sadistic, childish evil, unfettered by the cautious try-hard some authors exhibit when writing adults. She is rotten to the core. She is spoilt, murderously violent, infinitely selfish, and utterly loathsome. If she were the antagonist, I might even be giving this show a positive review. I would be forced to tip my hat to an author so skilled at manipulating his readers that he can craft a character that summons such immediate distaste in everyone. I\u2019m not a violent person, but I\u2019d say she needs a bit of discipline in the form of a high-speed baseball bat to the mouth.\\n\\n\r\nBut she\u2019s not the antagonist. She\u2019s not even an easily-overlooked secondary character. Her name\u2019s in the title. And we are supposed to love her. We are supposed to pile our disposable income on Blu-Rays and posters bearing her visage, on models of her likeness to sit precariously upon our shelves so that we can steal a peek at her plastic panties.\\n\\n\r\nAria H. Kanzaki is really the lowest the tsundere phenomenon can go. I don\u2019t have anything against tsunderes, really. In fact, when written carefully and realistically, they are some of my favourite characters. Aria is not a tsundere. She\u2019s a psychopath and a bully. She is hysterical, she is capricious, she is downright mean\u2014she is everything that might lead a man (were he so inclined) to roll his eyes and scoff and say, \u201cWomen! Am I right?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhich is a good segue into my next point.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not mad at Aria, because she is a fictional character, and that would be silly. I am mad, however\u2014frothingly so\u2014at the author. Chuugaku Akamatsu has written a character who he believes to be a sympathetic woman. The audience is supposed to watch her temper tantrums and violent fits the same way we might watch an angry child, despite the fact that Aria is more than old enough to know better. Her fits of rage aren\u2019t horrifying\u2014they\u2019re cute! This sort of behaviour is just the thing the author\u2014and, he perceives, his audience\u2014expects out of a woman.\\n\\n\r\nNow, we could say that Aria\u2019s temper\u2014and, by extension, the exceedingly childish behaviour of most of the rest of the female cast\u2014is just the author clumsily trying to write a realistically flawed character. People aren\u2019t perfect, after all, and violently temperamental women (and men) do exist!\\n\\n\r\nBut I\u2019m not stupid, and, hopefully, neither are you.\\n\\n\r\nThe author\u2019s intent matters. The target audience matters. The moe phenomenon matters. Japanese society and its views on women matter. The context matters.\\n\\n\r\nLook. I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re a bad person if you enjoyed Hidan no Aria. Do what makes you happy. I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re a bad person if you enjoy any fiction that carries some unfortunate implications in its characterisation of women, people of colour, GLBT people, or any minority\u2014it\u2019s perfectly possible for a story that is otherwise well-written to stumble a bit when it comes to political correctness (and I hate that fucking term, because it implies that treating other people like human beings should be done out of obligation and not common sense), and this is okay, as long as it is discussed. And I\u2019m not trying to take away your titty anime. There are plenty of shows that reward the viewer with gratuitous unmentionables while at the same time sporting a cast of realistic, relatable, well-written female characters. In fact, if Hidan no Aria was a good show that happened to have a horrible female lead, I might not even mention it. Well, maybe in passing.\\n\\n\r\nBut Hidan no Aria is bad, and I hate it, and writing this review feels like a weight off my shoulders after nearly five hours wasted on this garbage. So I will mention it. And I did. And I think I\u2019m done now.\\n",

            "content": "I really am trying to not become one of those cynical anime watchers who think the best has already come and never will again, but you\u2019re really trying my resolve this year Japan.  Hidan no Aria was a show that for whatever reason I had a great deal of excitement and anticipation for.  I was won over by the early pre-production artwork without knowing really anything at all about what it was going to be about or the source materials.  When I learned the seiyuu cast and the plot synopsis I was pretty sure what I was going to be in storefor.  In that sense I probably shouldn't have been disappointed at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Hidan no Aria gives us as a premise is about as generic and played as it comes.  A high school boy... sigh why is it I always have to start it with that?  Anyway he goes to Butai High School, a place where Japan teaches its youngsters to be assassins, thieves, and super powered shrine maidens.  It\u2019s like any other anime high school except the students all carry guns and katanas.  No seriously it\u2019s just like every other high school.  So from there our hero, Kinji, suitably useless and powerless Japanese male gets involved right off the bat with the more dangerous female classmates who either want his body or him dead or more often both.  Of course Kinji is able to tap into a hidden power of his own called \"Hysteria Mode\" which he enters from being sexually aroused.  Really I'm serious here.  I can't make this stuff up.  Further nonsense ensues from this point and I honestly couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of any of it from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nAs with most anime of this type it likes to throw out tons of nonsensical and contradictory terminology and other assorted garbage. While in the beginning it doesn't seem like that much of a stretch it really starts to take a turn for the bizarre after a few episodes.  That\u2019s when we start having characters assigned names from other fictional and totally unrelated content.  Such as Sherlock Holmes, Lupin IV, Jeane of Arc, and Dracula?  It\u2019s a mishmash of themes that have absolutely nothing in common with each other and make no sense when even applied to the story.  It\u2019s almost like the author of the story just picked random names from a library shelf and jammed them into his story as if they applied some sort of deeper meaning to it.  The names don\u2019t even have any bearing on how the characters act either.  Jeane of Arc has ice powers, Dracula is a werewolf, and Holmes is a gun totting, dual katana wielding loli.  Wuh?   This only further confuses an already pointless and directionless story which doesn't seem to stick to one theme for more than a few episodes before meandering off into another direction.   All in all it\u2019s bad... REALLY BAD.  Perhaps the worst excuse for a story I have seen in anything to date.\\n\\n\r\nThat brings us to the characters which really don\u2019t far much better.  Our hero Kinji is barely worth mentioning.  Seriously when are they going to just stop giving the guys in anime names or even bother drawing on faces on them anymore?  Just go ahead and give in to the otaku pervs and just complete the fantasy by having replacing them with faceless stick figures to allow them to complete their 2D on screen fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the girls the results are bad, even for a harem.  Other than Aria the other girls are pretty much unmentionable.  Aria is your standard loli tsundere.  She says all of the things you would expect of her archetype and is performed brilliant by the undisputed seiyuu queen of this type, Rie Kugimiya.  As much of a completely uninspired character or even acting performance that makes Aria up, it is Kugimiya that makes this series even remotely palatable to watch.  Sure we have seen her do this role dozens of times before but I for one really never grow tired of it.  In that sense it is a thoroughly Kugimiya type performance that is right in her wheel house and one that she completely hits out of the park.  The real question is how many people are, unlike me, totally sick and tired of it?\\n\\n\r\nJ.C. Staff is usually pretty solid with their animation and production values and that doesn't really change here.  But a lot like Kugimiya, I suspect a great many viewers are becoming weary of seeing the same damn thing over and over again.  It would be nice to see them try to stretch themselves sometimes and be unafraid to take some risks.  The one thing that really did stand out to me was how utterly silly the various girls hid their weapons.  Take Aria, who is a tiny girl with an impossibly short skirt yet somehow manages to hid 2 enormous pistols under it and yet not be constantly seen when she is not drawing them.  In addition to the even more ridiculous dual katanas she hides, under her blouse.  It seems Aria's clothes are a lot like Doctor Who's TARDIS: bigger inside than it appears from the outside.  Not that this is the first time anime has played with physics before but this really seemed to stretch the realm of believability.\\n\\n\r\nFrom an acting and sound standpoint, Hidan no Aria is very good.  As mentioned I think Rie Kugimiya was in her element and delivered a very enjoyable performance.  The rest of the cast played their parts as expected.  The music was pretty exciting and good.  I especially enjoyed May'n Scarlet Ballet.  \\n\\n\r\nI actually found a great amount of this series to be amusing, mostly because I am a Kugimiya fangirl.  As nonsensical and clich\u00e9d as everything about this anime was there was plenty of amusement to be found in watching the characters act this way.  But at the same time I am fully aware that pretty much everything else about this show is terrible.  For that reason I can\u2019t recommend it to anyone.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is bad, guys. I mean, it's really REALLY bad!\r\n'Hidan no Aria' has just about every cliche harem elements in the book. The premise focusing on a special occupation to try to be unique, the characters strip and trip randomly for fan service, violent retribution for accidental infringement, archetype heroines, obvious tsundere stuttering, ordinary high school student with hidden special powers, protagonist is surrounded by girls who are crazy about him for no reason... I can go on and on.\r\nThe core premise is somewhat interesting. It's set in a school that trains mercenaries, and the students undergo various lethal training and get credits through actualmissions. However, there are also a lot of stupid concepts going on, like all them being \"butei\" (combat detectives), the Hysteria Mode, and the fact that almost every character is descendent of a famous historical and fictional figures - Lupin the 3rd, Sherlock Holmes, Joan of Arc, Tooyama Kinshirou, Himiko, Count Dracula... it gets embarrassing to watch after a while.\\n\\n\r\nThe story consists of one improbable event after another. The character and villain's actions rarely make any sense. It gets so bad that a good guy would point the gun at the bad guy and say something like \"there's no escape now\", and the bad guy just runs without getting shot. I had no idea why this series needed to be about \"detectives\" as there were almost zero thinking going on. It's more like charge in first and see what happens next. It's also pretty absurd all the characters were carrying the gun and shoots around in the school campus, and of course, everything is bullet proof so no one gets hurt. The jokes get repetitive, with the protagonist getting into ecchi situation with random girls, and seen by one of the yandere/tsundere heroines and gets \"kaza-ana\".\\n\r\nWorst of all is the protagonist's \"Hysteria Mode\", which gets triggered from sexual arousal. This is the stupidest activation trigger I have ever heard, and serves only as a tool for fan service. \\n\\n\r\nArt in this series is decent. The female characters are attractive, though extremely generic design. Character movement is very stiff and apparently low budget, but there are some nice slow motion action scenes that it's at least average quality in terms of animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe voicing for Aria is absolutely horrible, a stereotypical tsundere voice with zero distinction. Not only that, it gets seriously annoying after a while. Other characters' seiyuu were average at best. BGM is quite insignificant, and OP/ED were average.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing in 'Hidan no Aria' that sets it apart from hundreds of other harem series. It's obvious why a certain fansub group would trollsub a series like this, and in fact, the sound effects guys in this series started trolling in latter part of this series, like inserting sheep sounds at the mention of \u300c\u57f7\u4e8b\u300d, a word meaning \"butler\" but has similar pronunciation to Japanese word \"sheep\".\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, Riko's character was extremely hot both in design and personality, and ecchi in this series was decent. It's one of those series you watch to kill time, and see how bad it gets. B-But it's not like I enjoy watching this series or anything!",

            "content": "Hysteria Mode... It's like 'Pervergy' (pervert energy) but doesn't make your hair spike up in such ridiculous proportions.\r\nJoining me for today's review and providing commentary is none other than Master Yoda. Great to have you with me here today Master Yoda.\r\n\"To pleasure with you, it is my work\"\r\nUmm.. I think you mean \"It is my pleasure to work with you\" but somehow that came out wrong... Anyways, onwards to the review!\r\nHidan no Aria, or by it's English title  Aria the Scarlet Ammo was one of the many anticipated anime this year. Heck, even some fanboy/girl even created a page for the series on facebookeven before it started airing, while other fan claim it as \"One of the Best Anime of all Time\"\\n\r\nEven Master Yoda took the liberty of contributing by subbing a few of the episodes for the series.\\n\\n\r\n\"Subbing the anime, enjoy I have...\"\\n\\n\r\nWell I'm sure you do. But I can't say much for the audience though...\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of the series is quite popular among some factions of the audience in this modern era. An academy for training Butei (mercenaries but with a code of honor). Girls falling from the sky. Strong heroines. Absurd gun fights and explosions. And last but not least, HAREM! Everything an average youthful men wants but fail to achieve due to our constricting ties to reality. The premise itself made an interesting core for the story. But the question is, did it live up to the light novel's expectations?\\n\\n\r\nArt wise, it is far from being perfect but nevertheless is sufficient to provide detail on the author's perspective of what a world that is run by secret organizations, mercenaries and assassins. I have no problem with the sound as well as the BGM composed was befitting of an action genre anime with a tint of comedy.\\n\\n\r\n\"Not if anything to say about it, I have! Seen better animation for action I have\"\\n\\n\r\nFor the last time Yoda, you can't compare your movie animation to an anime animation. That's like comparing a light saber to a banana. But gives you heartburn but a different kind.\\n\\n\r\nList of Characters\\n\\n\r\nAria H Kanzaki..\\n\r\nContrary to popular beliefs, the H in Aria's name is Holmes NOT \"H\" for ECCHI! I'm saying this for the first and last time. I mean, what parent would give their daughter the name, 'Aria Ecchi Kanzaki\"? And Holmes is spelled H-O-L-M-E-S not `Olmes. She's not a gangsta. You hear me Yoda?\\n\\n\r\n\"Your mother, word to..\"\\n\\n\r\nYou know when you mix gangsta talk and Yoda talk, it just makes no sense..\\n\\n\r\nAria is supposedly the 4th generation descendant of Sherlock Holmes. A generic Tsundere (of course will come with an iron board chest) I find nothing particular interesting about her character in the anime. She's as generic as it gets when it comes to Tsundere female lead. Ok, so that covers the Tsundere Flat Chested Girl Fetish audiences. Treating the male lead as a slave, calling him 'idiot' for no apparent reason and of course being such a huge cock blocker.  But she is, not, without some positive values. She is portrayed as strong willed and independent. She goes out of her way to prove her mother's innocence as well as following her advice on finding her \"Watson\" or in other words a partner. \\n\\n\r\nAnd thus we have Kinji Tooyama, the Watson to Aria's Holmes.\\n\r\nKinji Tooyama is conditionally weak and a coward. Oh no. Well this isn't really new. If you're a proud owner of a harem you should be prepared to be stripped of all your dignity and strength. That's the basic foundation of a \"Class II Harem\" But I said \"conditionally weak because he has Hysteria Mode! His urge to protect women causes him to awaken to his the manly and elegant side. He chooses to escape from the Butei world after his elder brother was killed performing his duty but was badmouth by the community. Thus it would take a bomb on a bike, a bomb on a bus and a bomb on a airplane to change his mind and decide to serve as Aria's partner as a Butei. \\n\\n\r\nAnd what Harem wouldn't be completed without a neglected childhood friend. Shirayuki Hotogi, she's sort of like a miko so yeah I guess that covers the audience with a miko fetish. She is  one of the very few characters that possess psychic abilities.\\n\\n\r\n\"Within this young one, force is strong...\"\\n\\n\r\nRight... So Shirayuki  is of course portrayed as the one who showers her unconditional love to our male harem lead. Which could only mean one thing. YANDERE!!! It's been a long time since I've seen a Yandere in a harem. Yanderes serves as an important mechanism in a harem.\\n\r\nIt is indeed refreshing to see someone who could do the job for me, killing the main harem lead if he becomes such a nuisance. \\n\\n\r\nSo that's it for some of the main characters in the series. Wait, I know what you're thinking.. \\n\\n\r\n\"THIS ISN'T TORADORA SEASON 3???!!!\"\\n\r\nWhat gave you the slightest idea that it was, Mr.CAPSLOCK Warrior?\\n\\n\r\n\"I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS WAS HAREM ANIME! THERE'S ONLY TWO GIRLS. YOU LIED TO ME! YOU SUCK AS A HAREM KING! STOP TRYING TO BE FUNNY! IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT!!\"\\n\r\nWell, I wouldn't want to spoil the best moments in the novel and anime so I guess you have to figure out which other girls are in his harem. But I'm telling you it's not that hard to figure out... Basically any girl who had more than 3 conversation with the male harem lead in a harem genre anime will be automatically (and magically) fall in love with him.\\n\\n\r\nSo did the anime live up to it's expectation and hype? I would probably say no. However, it doesn't mean it was a failure. The novel had great aspect and content that if utilized in the anime would make it worth while to watch. Even though the whole youths in combat, mercs and assassins, ability users concept is pretty used many times. \\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting aspect about the series is that it follows a common trend in animes is to cameo famous historical figures names as characters. Well I won't spoil to you who appears and not.\\n\r\nBut I will tell you who doesn't\\n\r\n-Georgia WashMyThongs \\n\r\n-Christy CallMahBust\\n\r\n-Napoleoni Bonerpart\\n\r\nAnd other ideas names on historial figures being girly-fied? Feel free to comment on my profile.\\n\\n\r\n\"Girl version of my name, Yodarina, it would be...\"\\n\r\nI wouldn't be interested in a girl version of you anyways yoda\\n\\n\r\nIf you like gun duels, explosions, destruction and of course a follower of the Way of the Harem, all sandwich in supposedly labelled school life type genre? then you might find Hidan no Aria worthwhile. And if you like Yoda's fansub you could also request him to sub other animes.\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\nHaremu Kingu,\\n\r\nSinging Off!\\n",

            "content": "SPOILERS INSIDE.\r\nThis is not a show you love or hate. This is a show you\u2019re bound to regret watching. It\u2019s extremely clich\u00e9d, mediocre quality and a money-maker, and above all \u2013 annoying. But so ridiculously it sometimes is amusing.\r\nStill, two things make this series for me:\r\n1.\tAria\u2019s hairpin which is sadly gone after a while,\r\n2.\tKinji\u2019s Hysteria Mode.\r\nBeyond that, there is not much to see here. But then again \u2013 what can you expect from a series that was already highly overrated by the Japanese fans even before it aired? I should probably have said otaku instead of Japanese fans, excuse me, but that\u2019s what happened, withthis series being the most anticipated one of Spring 2011 season. Why, yes \u2013 in Japan. Don\u2019t they love Kugimiya.\\n\\n\r\nStory- and character-wise, what\u2019s in it? Tsundere (but not the likeable kind, the I-have-seen-this-how-many-times-now kind) female lead \u2013 check. Male protagonist being useless 95% of the time \u2013 check. Veeeeery unexpected plot twist in early part of the show \u2013 check. A bunch of supporting characters that are there just to try to fill us in on the backstory and still fail miserably \u2013 check. Great. The two protagonists attend a mostly ridiculous school where teenagers are trained to be detectives - or rather super agents - and so far the plot has been focusing on how cute Aria is. But she is not. She is another Taiga/Louise/Shana clone created just to please the fans. There are moments when she is bearable; yet that is mostly when she is not talking at all. And the Holmes crap? I thought Lupin the 4th was quite funny, but they had to add Holmes the 4th into it. Wow, just wow. UPDATE: they also tossed Jeanne d\u2019Arc in. I thought that nothing could surprise me anymore.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what about Kinji/Ry\u00fbji? The 5% he\u2019s not useless is when in Hysteria Mode, which he is reluctant to enter because it makes him act retarded. In his opinion. It does not.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals J.C. Staff did just reasonably. I like how the opening and ending sequences are animated, plus the fights - the fights are great eye candy. The rest is not something we have not seen yet. I\u2019m just quite surprised that they do not animate the protagonist loli particularly well. Low budget? No way. Laziness? More like it. Little can be said about the art of \u201cHidan no Aria\u201d. It\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s just nothing spectacular, and given how new anime can look, I\u2019d call it a tad disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a different story. Good background music, that\u2019s certain; OP and ED, just fitting for this series, are average; but for once I must complain about the voice actors. Rie Kugimiya \u2013 if it was not for Kagura, she could disappear completely from the face of Earth. She does not create her characters. She IS them. Very, very disappointing. She brings nothing new into yet another show. I used to like her voice, but damn, isn\u2019t it annoying. Now it\u2019s just painful. Boring, too. Just remain Kagura, that\u2019s what you do well (and Taiga, for that matter). Going on with the list: Mariya Ise was a good Stocking, but performs just typically as Riko; Junji Majima is Ry\u00fbji, end of story.\\n\\n\r\nSomehow I managed to watch the entire thing. SOMEHOW. The second half gets far worse than the first, which, frankly, is an achievement. Just do not watch it. At all.\\n\\n\r\nVery not recommended.\\n",

            "content": "Girls with guns and fiery explosions tailing behind. That statement alone should sound pretty awesome, right? ... Right?\r\nUnfortunately, this is not the case. Oh, on everything that is sacred, is this not the case. But, it's not enough to say that this is a load of crap that deserves any and every amount of ridicule that it gets; this needs to be broken down, bit by bit, to expose it for the grim piece of bloody, scarlet-colored turd that it really is.\r\nWith that said, let's begin with the opening song--the thing the audience hears at the start of every episode.\r\nI, personally, have nothing against May'n.However, this song began to get annoying after a while due to the immediate pretentiousness that it brings along. The gun and firing sound effects, the cathedral with a picture of (what I assume to be) the birth of Jesus, front-and-center, and then Aria, the heroine of the show, staring at the audience blankly in the face--it speaks for itself. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and need I remind everyone that Aria's supposed to be the main character here? With all of the sarcasm in every fiber of my being, I don't think the opening made it clear enough! There needs to be even MORE Aria! Her shooting a bullet at the audience's faces? Perfect!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, what are all of the guns about? Well, let me explain as frankly as I can.\\n\\n\r\nApparently, in our modern-day world, it's perfectly okay and only natural to give teenagers, who are still going through emotional and psychological development, a vast assortment of armaments and weaponry and virtual access to anywhere in the world. Not only that, they're also taught how to use said weaponry to great detail and are sent on missions that could potentially endanger their lives. \\n\\n\r\nAnd they're accomplishing all of this... wait for it...\\n\\n\r\n... in a Japanese high school. \\n\\n\r\nForget all of the legal trouble that would cause, how something as ridiculous as that would even get off the ground, and even the idea that such a thing may be better-off in the hands of ANYONE older by just a few more years; just use your suspension of disbelief, everyone!\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode starts us off with the usual Kyon-type character, Kinji Tooyama, who isn't really the main character, but supposed to simply act as support. What is his aspiration for the future? Why, to live a normal, everyday life! Wow, really pushing the limits of characterization here, aren't you, J.C. Staff? I can't wait for him to live out his everyday--no, wait, he gets attacked by the villain of the show before the audience actually gets to know him. Pfft, so much for his goals!\\n\\n\r\nBut, when he thinks that he's nearly dead meat, stuck in a death trap that will surely cost him his well-being, there goes the true heroine, Aria H. Kanzaki, to save the day! And this is pretty much the only time that she gets to be cool before becoming the laughing stock of all that is \"tsun.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhy? Because the Kyon-type character gets a raging hard-on from seeing Aria in her underwear after saving him and becomes the actual hero, stopping the baddies because he's too cool for school. Really. That happens.\\n\\n\r\nKinji monologues later that he has a special ability known as \"Hysteria Mode\" that actually makes him an instantaneous, top-ranked assassin everytime he gets a boner; I'm not even joking. This happens quite a lot throughout the series because Kinji just can't keep it down, and nearly all of the female characters lose their dignity to this because it's the only thing that makes him worth anything in this show.\\n\\n\r\nHey, it's not like this could be Black Lagoon or Kara no Kyoukai where a woman kept her dignity, was a central character AND completely awesome. Come on, Hidan no Aria! I don't think there are enough breasts flopping around or widescreen panty-shots for the audience!\\n\\n\r\nBut, wait! I've spent all of this time talking about Kinji! What about Aria, the shining, tsundere selling-point of the show?\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's really all there is to her. Aria is a tsundere to the nth degree. She even initially calls Kinji her \"slave\" and lives with him, very similarly to ANOTHER show made by J.C. Staff. Heck, she's so tsundere that she becomes unlikable mere seconds after she speaks because of how much a squealing, raging runt that she is, and her gimmick is that she will constantly fire her guns at Kinji while screaming at him that he's either a pervert or stupid. The girl even admits that she doesn't have any friends. Hmm, I wonder why!\\n\\n\r\nOh, and I nearly forgot to mention that the show tries to be cute by adding in references to fictional detective characters, such as Lupin and Holmes, stating that the \"H\" in Aria's middle name stands for \"Holmes\" and that she--a whiny, putrid, pink-haired good-for-nothing--is his descendant.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by \"good-for-nothing\", I mean it. Aria is supposed to be a top-ranked assassin--even given the nickname \"Aria the Quadra\" for her use of four weapons--and yet, she's always needing saving, doesn't have any regard for human life other than her own, and has the attitude of a spoiled, indecisive, quickly-amused child.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is she regarded as the \"best\" again? Why is everyone putting the most difficult missions on her shoulders? Why couldn't the crazy world that this story encompasses just trade her in for a better lead character?\\n\\n\r\nOh, yes, I almost forgot BECAUSE MERCHANDISING DEMANDS IT.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention, the audience, as does Kinji, is clearly supposed to find her physically appealing, too. Sorry, but personally, I can't find a hateful, loathsome numb-nut attractive. I'd rather go with the blonde chick who's into eroge and frilly dresses that also appears in this show, thank you.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, when it comes to the plot itself, it's not even anything worth sneezing at. Many of the plot-twists are those anyone could see coming from a mile away, the characters also pull-off stunts that are near-impossible (if not, completely impossible under human conditions), and some characters appear only once or twice for plot-convenience and are never heard from or seen ever again (i.e., Reki, Jeanne d'Arc, etc.). There are even some points in the story that are barely touched upon, such as the supernatural powers that come forth numerous times.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is bland and one-dimensional, and the animation is typically stiff all of the time. The soundtrack is completely unnoticeable for the most part, save for the opening and ending themes, which are simply okay at best.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, without giving too much away about the plot, this was painful--just downright painful. It has a plot and setting that would make Swiss cheese blush and horrible characters that are unsympathetic, stereotypical, and--more than often--outrageously annoying; not to mention, a pretentious presentation of nothing special that is of a (hopefully) dying breed.\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone else managed to sit through this garbage until the end (like I did), they deserve a medal. I can only hope that with such a low bar set, J.C. Staff will make their upcoming series, Kamisama no Memochou, an aspiring improvement. \\n\\n\r\nPlease don't bother twiddling your thumbs with the possibility of a second season, J.C. Staff; otherwise, I fear the worst--that everyone will just stop caring~",

            "content": "*Updated on May 30, 2011*\r\nMost of us can recognize tropes and cliches from a mile away, well consider this the picture book for tropes and cliches, which you can look all you want and if you've seen this \"book\" before, it won't be much for those whom seen it already, despite the fact it's one of those books where you can hide a gun in.\r\n*The first review is a first episode basis review, after that it's the real deal.*\r\nEPISODE 1 REVIEW: It starts out with a teenage boy named Kinji riding his bike at ludicrous speeds that would make bmxers envious appears to be chasedafter right off the bat by a...? \\n\r\nA segway armed with an uzi and a speaker attached to it? Weird. \\n\r\nBut at least there's a better reason for him to speeding the way he is, there's a bomb under his seat, literally, and it is set to blow up if he lowers his \"Speed\".\\n\r\nLucky for him a young, long haired, flat chested (Whom's breast will be the butt of many ecchi jokes no doubt) girl named Shana! Er...Taiga! Oh wait, Aria, who comes to his rescue with CG gunfire.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is what happened before any of this; the main character is getting ready for mercenary school (With guns, bullet proof vests, and all sorts of cool shit) while listening to his hormonal friend cry about everything the main character does or say making her instantly annoying (While the main character tries his best to keep a \"whatever man\" attitude), but she has big boobies and all is forgiven.\\n\r\nMeanwhile a teacher at said school is giving out an introduction to a class about the school and mentioning a criminal who is out killing the students (The teacher really doesn't seem bothered by this so the adults in this anime probably don't give a shit).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime then fast forwards back to where it left off and the two characters are in an awkward sexual position and the main freaks out and takes the chance to check out his companion who has issues with her bodily proportions whom also freaks out accordingly.\\n\r\nBut the antics come to a close as a pack of blood thirsty uzi segways starts to shoot up the place, but unfortunately for the segways the main character has the ability to abruptly swap out his character for a total badass who then, after chasing the segways away with CG animation gunfire, starts putting the moves on Aria who he thinks is a middle or elementary schooler (Who'd blame him? and creepy), but of course she's in high school (Obvious as hell)!\\n\\n\r\nAfter that the main character proceeds to school while nonchalantly explaining that his family genes is the reason he can swap to a more fun character to watch called \"Hysteria mode\" (Oh I see, it makes sense now, I guess?), then when he reaches his homeroom, Aria is there and everyone calls them lovers.\\n\\n\r\nAfterwards Aria moves in with him out of the blue, the end.\\n\\n\r\nMy obnoxiously massive sarcasms aside, this anime has many routes it can go judging off the first episode, but many of those roads may cause a severe case of dejavu for many viewers who at this point couldn't care less about another ecchi or harem anime, but for those who don't know the tropes and cliches or feel comfortable watching familiar elements will most likely enjoy this anime the most.\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nREAL REVIEW\\n\\n\r\n*I'm spoiling a lot, but frankly, I don't give a f**k*\\n\\n\r\nWhat's popular isn't necessarily good, but what's good isn't necessarily popular, Aria painfully falls into the former.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: J C has made some of the most popular anime out there, Shakugan no Shana, Toradora, Azumanga Daioh, and Toaru Majutsu no Index are all great examples. So obviously they want to continue the trend train with another runaway hit, right?\\n\\n\r\nWell this is the good example of \"Animate whatever random light novel that's out there, no matter what it is,\" syndrome, which is now common for many animation studios.\\n\\n\r\nToo common for J C unfortunately, my guess would be that J C took one look at the titular character and thought, \"Hey, she's underdeveloped physically, she's flat chested, and has long hair! By god, she's like the last couple of girls we animated, and even the novels she's in are popular! Let's animate this!\"\\n\\n\r\nWell, let me put my syndrome in this way: it's kinda like the pokemon games, it gets staler and staler with each and every game, same ole same ole.\\n\r\nUnlike the required updates for the pokemon games though, the anime J C puts out is lesser quality for this one, even Shana (An anime that's over 5 years old now) looks noticeably better than Aria, an anime that started in early-mid 2011, which anyone would easily be justified to call it lazy.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's look at the story now, that always compensates any lack luster animation, right?\\n\\n\r\nEhhh, it starts out being nothing special in the least, main male character starts to bond with Aria by doing small stuff like looking for a cat, or going on a date, though it was more babysitting than anything else. Though the male has his unique (Yet random) character trait that literally changes his entire character from typical main male lead who's just a tool for the ladies to mr suave lady killer bad ass, which is quite refreshing for that role... but he doesn't do it enough and just leaves you feeling more desired, though if it did happen more, the anime would just be a full on harem because he has to be (sexually) excited in order for it to happen.\\n\\n\r\nBut the on going plot has to do with a criminal called the butei (Butei, sounds a lot like it's pronounced \"booty\" in english, obviously not a lot of thought was put into this name decision) killer, who arranges EVERY life or death situation like the movie \"Speed\" by hijacking vehicles from segways to planes and setting bombs all over the place, doing it once was good enough for people to smile at and say \"It's like that movie, that cool,\" but three more times? With each becoming more ridiculous than the last, like it's trying to out do it's self.\\n\\n\r\nThen the anime immediately train wreaks by episode 4.\\n\\n\r\nBy that I mean character twists in that episode are embarrassingly ridiculous, one of the characters, the culprit (Who barely gets much screen time, that on top of her weak motives for doing the crimes) reveals that she is the descendant of Lupin, then reveals that Aria is the descendant of Sherlock Holmes\\n\\n\r\nSherlock Holmes vs Lupin, let it sink it and just try to convince yourself that this doesn't sound stupid in the least.\\n\r\nThere was absolutely no sign of Aria's relation to Holmes. 100% completely out of the blue, and for no good reason for either character, with only Aria's middle initial and a silhouette of Sherlock himself in the opening animation as lazy hints clues, all the while it abruptly ends the first main story.\\n\r\nIt's such a bad twist that even M. Night Shyamalan himself would facepalm.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for some reason they start treating the whole thing like they solved an actual case... Seriously, at the end of episode 5 one of them says case solved out of no where, which was just damn stupid of them to say because the criminal reveals herself to them and even runs away as well, what the hell has been solved? My limit towards nonsensical bullshit?\\n\r\nShe could honestly continue to rip off that movie to still cause mayhem and just because they know who she is, doesn't mean they can stop it, she did it four time or more and she can continue to do it again without anything to worry about, another person could just take over for her because that way of hijacking doesn't look hard at all to pull off.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of the culprit, she herself is the most ridiculous and nonsensical person of the whole bunch.\\n\r\nFrom revealing secrets to just seemingly making up whatever bullshit she wants, it'll just make you groan with irritation.\\n\r\nNot to mention that she performs feats of sheer nonsense, to using her hair as a weapon with no explanation until episodes later (Even the most mediocre shonen series would at least explain at the moment for whats happening in the context of it's world), to using her own clothes as a parachute.\\n\\n\r\nRidiculous, typical, looks cheap, and rehash, I'm sure there's more words to describe the mediocre anime that is Hidan no Aria, but that's just enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: The characters designs are really uninspired and just unfortunately are too similar to many of JC's past productions. \\n\r\nTo be honest, Aria looks exactly what would a cross between Shana of Shakugan no Shana and Taiga of Toradora would look like, just a shana with green hair.\\n\r\nThe animation is good, but not amazing, though I would be lying if I said the gun fights weren't exciting, but then again I've seen them done better (Little assassins, a famous outlaw, and an iconic hellish vampire comes to mind).\\n\r\nDuring many of the gun fights, CG animation is used, but I'll leave that to subjective views.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The Tsundere queen repraises her role once again, and that's the only thing really noticeable, the opening is alright and ending sounds great, but leaves no impression.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Decent animation, outside of the CG stuff I mean.\\n\\n\r\nMixed:\\n\r\n+/- Rie Kugimiya voicing another tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Retarded plot.\\n\r\n- Cliched like you wouldn't believe.\\n\r\n- The whole cast of characters are nothing more than the generic rip offs that are generic rip offs.\\n\r\n- Half the time the anime makes no sense.\\n\r\n- Episode 4, seriously that episode is bad from start to finish.\\n\r\n- Rehashes too many of it's plot devices.\\n\\n\r\nYou really can't blame me for reading too far into the anime, and it is kinda entertaining in it's own way, well it's stupid as entertainment (You can play a nice drinking game for every stupid element to help you get through it).\\n\r\nYou can say it's a whole new Shakugan no Shana, but the story is just too incompetent to even make that statement, even Aria herself has no redeeming qualities.\\n\r\nI'm sure they could've redone the story in a way that would make more sense, plenty of anime companies have done so, but this one is just an obvious cash in.",

            "content": "Not the best anime, but Hidan No Aria was to me an enjoyable one, and since it is highly criticized, I decided to write a review.\r\nThe background of the story is attractive, I mean, studying in order to be able to fight criminals sounds nice, and it leads to some nice action scenes. Although the plot isnt that convincing, it is not a boring one. The beginning of the scenario is a commonplace, it starts with a highschool student, at the beginning of yet another year. The highschool not being seen as a true highschool, it can help to forget the number of anime possibilyseen starting like this.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it is a recent anime, so it is pretty good overall. For the soundtracks, the openingending, I found them pretty catchy (the singer for the opening is May'n, also known for the opening of Accel World), especially the opening.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, the part that contributes the most (as well as the storyline) to Hidan No Aria's bad reception, the characters. Basically, the story revolves around two main characters, one guy (Kinji) and one girl (Aria), a tsundere. Obviously people who dislike the basic concept of tsunderes will probably dislike this anime, since there is a non negligeable part of it around her. She has everything to fits the cliche, she is even voiced by Rie Kugimiya, so your point of view will also depends if you got bored of her tsundere voice or not. Kinji, on the other hand, is less of a stereotype, and is entertaining to watch. He displays ... quite a unique trait. \\n\\n\r\nSo, overall, this anime is more of a good distraction than a breathtaking anime, but still, isn't that the point of animes? From my point of view, if you are fine with tsundere/gun or sword fighting, give it a try, in the worst case you'd lose an hour or so.",

            "content": "As I\u2019ve watched this 12 episode anime (with one episode to go), the title itself was good, and the comic aspect is also good especially when it involves the muchacho (Kinji) getting his ass kicked by Aria. This anime follows the same arc of girl comes into boys life and messes with it, however there are stuffs in this anime that doesn't fit, so I'll describe it through my ratings:\r\nStory: fair 6.\r\nAs I've mentioned this anime follows the same arc as that of girl comes into boy's life and messes with it, ok, so the chiquita (Aria, the main female lead) comes into Kinji's lifeas she mentions, she's in search of a partner and finds it in the muchacho (Kinji the male lead) who already made his mind to leave Tokyo Butei High School on the next school year. As the plot goes the chiquita needs him for his special ability and help her to prove her Madre's (the female lead's mother) innocence\u2019s. However as the anime goes on until it\u2019s final episode, things are getting a bit messy, from the muchacho being happy co\u2019z he\u2019s gonna be freed from the Chiquita after one successful mission, only to agree to be her partner a.la Sherlock and Dr. Watson, to protecting Shirayuki and eventually being part of his household and to forming up an unpleasant alliance with the conniving \u201cButei Killer\u201d Riko in the last 3 episode of the this anime. Also, aside from action, school and comedy, additional genres started to add up like ecchi, martial arts, magic and supernatural. I kinda doubt if the existence of the EU and its members would end in the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so far the way the characters were drawn have resembles that from \u201cKore Wa Zombie Desu Ka,\u201d however, the illustrator\u2019s concept of Aria is too awkward, there were scenes  were her pigtails are longer that her body, and the illustrator\u2019s idea of arming her with 2  M1911 Colt pistols and 2 katanas doesn\u2019t suit her very well. As for the rest of the characters drawn, I don\u2019t have much to comment.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nnothing much to say her.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I really am disgusted with the author\u2019s preference of using names of prominent characters both fictional and real life in relation to the cast of this anime, in fact it is even insulting to the authors and families of these prominent characters, such as Sherlock Homes, Arsene Lupin and even to the historical figure like Genghis Khan and Minamoto no Yoshitsune . So let me discuss each of main cast:\\n\\n\r\nKanzaki Aria Homes- So, in this anime she\u2019s an elite Butei \u201cS\u201d rank with a \u201cQuadra\u201d title under  her belt, also she\u2019s a 4th generation of the Sherlock Homes clan. Ok, enough of that, the thing here is, unless Sherlock Homes did went into a relationship Irene Adler, somewhere in the late 19th century (my estimate would be in 1887 to 1905) then she would have not be the 4th generation but a 5th or 6th generation of the Homes clan, her character is simply a complete opposite of what Sherlock would be, she would be considered as a \u201cBlack Sheep\u201d of Homes legacy  and if Sir Arthur Conan Doyle were to read or watch this anime he\u2019ll be very pissed.\\n\\n\r\nTooyama Kinji- he does as what is expected of being the muchacho in this anime with a harem genre, he doesn\u2019t know what to do with them (his harem) except get his ass kicked. Now, now, so what gives about this muchacho? The author of this anime/manga have given him a disorder called \u2018Hysteria Savant Syndrome\u201d somehow the author just picked up some random psychiatric terminology and put them together without even knowing what it is, making him a complete idiot, the terminology itself are compose of  2 words that are an \u201cOxymoron,\u201d so let\u2019s identify the 2 psychiatric terminology: \u201cHysteria\u201d \u2013 is defined as an unmanageable emotional excess due to over whelming fear that may be cause by multiple events in one's past that involved some sort of severe conflict. And \u201cSavant\u201d - a rare condition in which people with developmental disorders have one or more areas of expertise, ability, or brilliance that are in contrast with the individual's overall limitations. The muchacho doesn\u2019t have any of those and the author should have just stick to \u201cMultiple Personality Disorder\u201d co\u2019z that\u2019s what he has.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRiko Mine Lupin  the 4th \u2013 according to info she the 4th descendant of Arsene Lupin, here the author  obviously took the concept of  the anime  Lupin III and made it look like that Fujiko Mine another character from the same anime had finially made it out with Lupin himself  and the end product is Riko. Riko\u2019s  character in this anime is more of being a conniving, manipulative and street smarts  as Fujiko Mine, her  Madre (mother), however she doesn\u2019t have the wits to pull a heist  like her father,  another thing about her, is that one can\u2019t tell whether or not she has feelings for the muchacho or was she just using him for her  whatever plans she has for the muchacho, the moment she reappears on the 9th episode it is mentioned that she made some kind of deal with the school \u2026.you know, when a criminal make a deal with the prosecutor it always doesn\u2019t mean a get out of jail ticket, there are a lot of factors that a prosecutor has to consider. And, as nauseating for me to say, the author of this anime just has no idea as to how deals like that work for a criminal who wish to cooperate. I haven\u2019t read the actual writing of Maurice Leblanc but according to info Arsene Lupin is not only a gentleman thief, but is also a womanizer, so there will be a lot of 4th generation of the gentleman thief\u2019s great grandchildren roaming around. Like Aria, she is can\u2019t be the 4th generation of the gentleman thief, she would be instead be the 5th generation and not the 4th generation. Lucky for author of this anime and Lupin III anime that   French writer Maurice Leblanc who conceptualize the gentleman thief has long pass-away otherwise they\u2019ll be looking at a law suit.\\n\\n\r\nReki \u2013 Ok, now this character even get\u2019s weirder, she armed with a   Dragunov sniper rifle which nearly every special op would shy away from and according to info she\u2019s a descendant of  Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Genghis Khan\u2026\u2026..seriously , another historical name dropping by the author. Definitely no respect for the historical figures, co\u2019z there is no way that these people who even see each other or discuss any treaties. Don\u2019t forget, that Genghis Khan\u2019s son Kublai Khan failed to invade Japan. Also nearly every one of Genghis Khan\u2019s sons are womanizers and there will be a lot of his generations roaming around Mongolia, Siberia and in China and nearly none of them will probably have no idea that they\u2019re the descendants of Genghis Khan.        \\n\\n\r\nJeanne\u2019d Arc \u2013 her appearance in the latter episode adds another genre to this anime and it becomes freakier, according to info she\u2019s the 30th descendant of Joan of Arc and just like Riko, she was able to get a \u201cGet Out of Jail\u201d ticket by making a deal with the prosecutor . Ok enough of that, so does the first Jeanne\u2018d Arc have any supernatural powers? Well, she did unite France against the English in the middle ages, but man, I wonder if the author wants us to believe that there is some kind of mysticism surrounding the real Jeanne\u2018d Arc. Then again experts theorize that Jeanne\u2018d Arc herself is suffering from some kind of mental disorder which lead some inquisitors to believe that she\u2019s a witch.  The myth that the Jeanne \u201cd Arc that was burn on the stake is not the real one but a stand-in is not new, in fact there are some nutcase cults who believe that someone did volunteered to stand-in for her to be burned in the stake. \\n\\n\r\nHotogi Himiko Shirayuki \u2013 Since she\u2019s the muchacho\u2019s childhood friend, I guess it\u2019s obvious as to how her relationship with the muchacho would go,  being a Shinto shrine maiden and being a good fighter don\u2019t go together unless she\u2019s a Taoist nun ,which she\u2019s not. I would have wish that she ends up with the muchacho, but, as always in this kind of anime, the childhood friend is always in the sidelines.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Butei High School \u2013 what about it? Info states that it is a high-school that teaches or trains kids as young as 15 -18 to become armed detectives, which by the way the author\u2019s concept of it, is full of crap, co\u2019z it kinda look like that the said institution is a \u201cPrivate Military Contractor\u201d training school, the reason is that everything mentioned what the students were doing is exactly what a PMC Mercenary does.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nWell, as I\u2019ve said the comic part of this anime is enjoyable enough, the action part, hummm, it\u2019s enjoyable as well, but, an uncensored ecchi would\u2019ve made this anime awesome.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll leave this blank\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Putting any gimmick into your average action show with romantic comedy has been a staple of a tradition for quite some time. Some succeed, and some don\u2019t. Which, in most cases, doesn\u2019t work because it is nothing more than a gimmick in hindsight. So what better way than to plaster guns into your generic romantic comedy in the title and artwork and pray that action fanatics might have some slight interest. Look no further than Hidan no Aria to fill in another entry in the bad category.\r\nNevertheless, it is not necessarily the shallow point of the spectrum in the category. For all I know, thereare some apparent intentions on becoming a straight-up action show, and it succeeds somewhat in that department. There are some impossible logic drops scattered throughout most of the action. But for a show that is this inept plot-wise, there isn\u2019t any reason to bash it any further for that reason. It wants its action to be flashy and fast-paced, so by those standards, there are plenty of interesting conceptual scenarios they put into them.\\n\\n\r\nLike any show that stars Rie Kugimiya as the main heroine and a tsundere non-surprising, there is bound to be light-hearted comedy thrown in for good measure. Now when I mention \u201cgood measure,\u201d I mean that in a haphazard way. When the comedy is right in Hidan no Aria, it is put together and hilarious to watch Aria\u2019s reactions to anything lewd. But man, when the jokes do not work, they fucking die horribly. It\u2019s not the fact the quips themselves aren\u2019t humorous, but the way they pace it together feels dragged out far too long than it needed to be. There\u2019s even one instance where Aria calls Kinji a baka repeatedly for almost 8 seconds and becomes tedious to experience.\\n\\n\r\nThese comedic interactions also falter from the fact that most of the characters are essentially just cardboard cut-out characters of different stereotypes and adds nothing significant to them. All that we can remember about them is the typical gags that were written for them. Shirayuki is the creepy childhood friend who has an intense crush on Kinji and always gets jealous whenever a girl is close to him. Then there is Riko Mine, who somehow has an attraction towards Kinji that is never given much context as to why she wants him to begin with. Indeed no amount of layers upon layers of depth could be seen in any of them because of this fatal flaw. If you want to show these girls in these positions, that is perfectly fine, but don\u2019t expect someone actually to latch onto them for just those assets.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d put some forward analysis on our male protagonist, Kinji Tooyama, only because there is something that needs to be said about protagonists that are typically written in these types of shows. We\u2019re all familiar with the general romantic comedy protagonist who gets flustered and becomes idiotic because of it. It is a redundant trope that we have gotten used to over the years; except with Kinji, he is not a character that possesses this trope. You\u2019d think that would lead to him being likable, right? Well, the answer to that is yes and no. In that, there\u2019s nothing really to him that makes him inherently riveting to watch in guiding through the plot, what little there is, to begin with. Just like the main female cast, all we\u2019re shown about him is what his role is to the story and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nUsually, I\u2019d like to start with talking about a show\u2019s plot in the first paragraph, but for Hidan no Aria\u2019s sake, I won\u2019t even give it the time of day for that honor. Not only that but it almost seemed as though the plot was very second nature to the show\u2019s intentions. Even though it looked like it wanted to based on how it tried to put in a severe tone of what seemed to have been a plot, it provides very few attempts to weave in a coherent story. The story is not only uninteresting but also difficult to follow because of the bad transitions to mindless comedic moments.\\n\\n\r\nWith Rie Kugimiya on board with a main project, it\u2019s always apparent to at least talk about the voice acting in the show she appears in. However, Aria is not one of the big highlights of her career. I say this from someone who may not be a huge fan, but I at least respect her range and energy she puts into her roles. It\u2019s one of her roles where if you absolutely can\u2019t stand her voice, Aria will definitely not turn you into a new convert for her fanbase. Her iconic \u201cbaka\u201d is probably the most thrown out in this show more than any other show she\u2019s been in so that right there should signify whether you want to stomach through that or not.\\n\\n\r\nNo expectations were any higher than medium from me when I was going into Hidan no Aria, but I was surprised to say that its negatives don\u2019t overshadow the positives too much. That, however, can\u2019t make it a recommendation by any stretch. It won\u2019t appeal to the people who want to have an insightful anime watching experience. But for the action crowd at large, it\u2019s not going to be an easy sell. If you think you can handle the screaming \u201cbaka\u201d lines repeatedly and the other nauseating character interactions, by all means, try; just don\u2019t expect much.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: C-",

            "content": "----\r\nPOSITIVES: unique background story and environment, great voice-acting, good mixture of action and comedy, great animation.\r\nNEGATIVES: stereotypical characters (especially supporting characters), possible plot-pacing and character development troubles, weak OP song, trying to fit too much (genres, characters, background information, etc.) into too short of a series.\r\n-----\r\nSUMMARY:\r\nHidan no Aria might pay small tribute to the \"girls with guns\" genre, but it's more Zero no Tsukaima than Gunslinger Girl.  Hidan no Aria, a J.C. Staff show, is almost a perfect combination of two of the production company's previous animes, Toradora! and Toaru Majutsu no Index/Toaru Kagaku no Railgun.  \r\nHidan no Aria focuses on the relationshipaftermath of a coincidental encounter between Aria, a self-proclaimed \"friendless\" tsundere S-ranked (top ranked) student in Assault Studies, and Kinji, \", a secretly skilled E-ranked student who hides his abilities in hopes of just having a normal school life and the only person able to entertain and catch Aria's interest.  Both Kinji and Aria are second-year butei (armed detectives) at Tokyo Butei High School, a school for butei training located on its own private island (much like Academy City in the Toaru series).  After seeing Kinji (voiced by Junji Majima, also the seiyuu for Ryuuji in Toradora!) demonstrate his true powers once, Aria (voiced by tsundere queen Rie Kugimiya, also the seiyuu for Taiga in Toradora!) decides she will do anything in order to bring Kinji back to the Assault Division and have him use his full abilities again.  The two strike a deal that Kinji will return to Assault on his own accord for one mission, and regardless of the difficult of the mission, he will complete it to the best of his abilities; however, Kinji silentely adds that the best of his abilities does not extend to his \"super abilities,\" since he is embarassed of the catalyst that causes them to activate.  And so their story begins... \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: (so far...) 8\\n\r\nThe story for Hidan no Aria, so far, is both unique and redundant at the same time.  This problem doesn't come from the overall ideas behind the story, like butei students, etc. but more from the generic characters (more on this below).  However if you can get over the initial feeling of seeing all these characters before in other animes, you get to enjoy a lot of comedic dialogue and situations, great actions, and the adventures and entanglements of two solid leading characters.  Hidan no Aria definitely has a lot of potential if it is executed well.  My only concern at this point is that the show is only 13 episodes long, and the main story is just about to begin after the first two episodes.  Balancing plot and character development could be tricky, and hopefully one isn't sacrificed for the other.  Hidan no Aria could be a great compact story like Angel Beats! or could fall apart with quite a bit of nothingness like IS: Infinite Stratos if production decides to focus on the harem aspect a bit too much.  Another potential problem is the pacing of the story.  While the first episode is jam-packed with action, encounters and background information, the second episode is very slow and feels like it could have been summarized in 5 minutes instead of being a stand-alone episode.  Hopefully the story will have better and more consistent pacing now that the main plot has been revealed.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\r\nHidan no Aria isn't the best animated series this season, but it certainly doesn't suffer in the animation department either.  Action scenes are slick and fluid, attention is paid to background details, and the character designs are quite nice as well.  Don't worry about seeing a lot of pan and zoom of the same frame or repeat animation, Hidan no Aria keeps it fresh.  Another aspect that Hidan no Aria tackles well is the fanservice.  While it is definitely a part of the show, the animation directors don't act on every possible chance or opportune moment to throw in a panty shot, etc.  Fanservice is only used to further the plotline of the show, so it's refreshingly done and you don't feel bombarded with it.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:  8 (much lower if you don't like Rie Kugimiya)\\n\r\nThe background sound effects and music serve the storyline very well.  They add to the action just as much as to comedic scenes.  The voice acting is superb.  When it comes to tsundere characters, no one quite gets the voice down like Rie Kugimiya (unfortunately if you are not a fan of her style of voice-acting for characters like Aria, Shana (Shakugan no Shana), Louise (Zero no Tsukaima), or Taiga (Toradora!), you might not be able to enjoy the show).  The opening theme is very generic D-list female popstar anime OP, but the ending theme, while nothing to jump for joy about, is much better.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7\\n\r\nThis is where Hidan no Aria runs into some problems.  The characters are formed out of VERY generic molds.  We have our talented tsundere, blonde loli, doting childhood friend, etc.  Basically, the girls surrounding Kinji cover just about every aspect of a harem you could look for (including a range of bust sizes, something Kinji is always keen to notice).  One definite redeeming quality though is that Kinji, our male lead, isn't being carried by Aria.  He is strong, can hold his own, and even can show up Aria in terms of skill, not having a whiny tag-a-long for the male lead is very refreshing.  Again, with 13 episodes and only  4 of the main characters introduced so far, it's difficult to tell whether there will be enough time to really develop all the characters, especially the supporting ones and also break them out of their generic molds as well.  Of course we can expect a hidden \"kick-a**\" side to each character, but will that be enough to really endear them to the viewer?\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\r\nHidan no Aria combines great animation, voice-acting, original story, comedic elements, action and the ability to keep you waiting for the next episode.  So far, it's off to a great start.  Despite some character and pacing flaws, the show is still enjoyable to the extent that most viewers will be willing to overlook any of its short-comings.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8",

            "content": "Judging from Hidan no Aria's credentials, it is a safe assumption that it is a run-of-the-mill rom-com with a tsudere at its core and a heaping helping of action. On the other hand it might be a surprise, using genre conventions to its advantage, as Toradora did. As it turns out Hidan no Aria is a surprise... a very unpleasant one. Constantly bombarding the viewer with an endless stream of cliches while throwing in ridiculous plot twists in order to \"spice things up\", this is a far worse experience than your average generic rom-com.\r\nThe show seems to be banking on J.C. Staff's previous successes. Itis directed by Takashi Watanabe, who had previously directed the popular Shakugan no Shana; plus has the voice of that show's star, Rie Kugimiya, as the show's heroine Aria. It also has Kugimiya's co-star in the massively successful Toradora, Junji Majima, as the male protagonist Kinji Tooyama. This in of itself feels like a cheap trick in order to win an audience. However, with such considerable talent, you would expect the show to at least be halfway decent.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself starts off decently enough, though quite predictable. Kinji finds himself in a life-endangering predicament and is saved by the petite but fierce Aria; a bond is formed between them as to be expected. The settings of the story are actually pretty interesting, with Kinji being enrolled in a school for armed forces, which explains why there are such heavily armed teenagers, albeit a rather silly explanation. Kinji himself has an entertaining gimmick with his \"Hysteria Mode\" which turns him from low-key and cynical to smooth-talking and arrogant. However, that is about the extent of praise that can be given, even this early into the show. Aria is the most annoying tsundere imaginable, falling straight into the pitfalls of the character type, and capturing none of its charm. Not even the queen of tsuderes herself, Rie Kugimiya, can safe this poorly constructed excuse of a character. Outside of hysteria mode, Kinji is just a typical, boring male lead. The rest of the cast is equally unimpressive, consisting of tired archetypes such as the possessive childhood friend, the stoic sniper girl, the impish antagonist, etc.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes this show a stinker, though, is the completely asinine plot. It is not just horribly written, it is actually insulting to the viewers' intelligence. Characters' motives are poorly justified, often cliche or just plain stupid. Sub-plots pop up right and left, just to come to train-wreak conclusions, or remain unresolved. The big bad crime syndicate, called the I-U, seems to be a group of gung-ho individuals who claim to be associated with each other, but show no coherent signs of being so. Really, it is more of a gigantic nonsensical mess than a plot. Most criminal of all is the shows use of historic figures and classic fictional characters as the reason behind everything; the list of names disgraced include Sherlock Homes, Arsene Lupin, Joan of Arc, and Count Dracula. All whom are concerned must be rolling around in their graves.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's technical merits are the aspect most worthy of praise. Takashi Watanabe does his damn best to try and make this dreck entertaining, and to some degree succeeds. The actions scenes are generally exciting and the comedy scenes, while hardly ever working, at least feel like there was some effort put in by the production staff. The artwork itself is bland and generic; yawn-worthy, really. The music pumps up the excitement of the action scenes, but is otherwise pretty unnoticeable. This is the high-point of the show, and honestly... it is not all that high.\\n\\n\r\nThe preview of the final episode features an in-joke, in which Aria seemingly forgets Kinji's name and calls him by Yuugi, Saito, and finally Ryuuji. Yes, this is a cute and funny in-joke for all who get it... but it is also a reminder of why shows like this are even created. It seems the modern anime fan is happy to consume just about anything, so long as it has established names attached to it. Really, why else would such drivel even be conceived?",

Yes, because 12 episodes isn't that much, and the anime has its original side. Famous people references, gun / swords fight, great art and motion. \r\nBut for me, a LovCom fan, I still enjoyed the anime, but was a bit sad at the ending, because the ending its like: \"Wait for the 2\u00ba Season\"\r\nStory 8/10: The Story...a School forsome kind of \"SWAT\" students, to fight crime and escort civilians, those kinds of stuff. But the catch comes when most of them have special powers, or important grandfathers. You will get some kind of romance, but nothing special, why? Because of the power of the main character, where he gets on rampage/boss/assassin/master mode (its the best side of the story, where he gets f*cking badass) when he thinks/makes dirty stuff, or (OFC) when he looks to Aria (main female), here it starts some kind of \"romance\". \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: The art/motion its the best on the anime, you can see the really good drawn action time, the fights, the reload animation, the characters and the ambient.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: I normally don't mind about the sound, but when I do. Are on the fight scenes, I don't understand much about music, but it made me pumped while I watch it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10: Well..You have one guy that gets OP when he gets excited whit girls, one girl (secondary) that doesn't talk much but its OP :D, another girl that gets embarrassed when he thinks about dirty things, another that only loves dirty things, and for the last, (drums) a girl that wants to marry the main male protagonist. Nothing from another world. In my opinion this is a typical Harem.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: Yes, this is f*cking funny, and awesome. Nice gun/powers/swords fights. And yes, there are some echii sceens. Nothing too much. Light Etchii.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo my opinion about the anime:\\n\\n\r\n1\u00ba Watch it if you like funny/harem style\\n\\n\r\n2\u00ba If you like Light romance between 2 main characters\\n\\n\r\n3\u00ba If you want an Harem where the male makes something useful for the girls (not a useless f*ck)\\n\\n\r\n4\u00ba Its small, easy to watch, and it doesn't need to much brain effort to watch it\\n\\n\r\nThe only bad thing in the anime was the first episode, it was too GOOD, why? Well when he gets on \"Hysteria Mode\" it was f*cking badass (best hysteria mode you will see on the anime), the way he talks to the girl, the way he \"kills\" the enemy...too Good for a first episode.",

Sure, you can find a few here and there that stand out above the crowed, but most are mediocre and that's where ARIA THE SCARLET AMMO comes in. It might actually be lower than mediocre. \r\nThe story is so cliche and so over used, that I was totally put off by it and stayed for the characters through the last four episodes. Boy meets, girl, she likes him he might like her, other girlslike him and they shoot people. Even people who hate anime know about this kind of anime, its so over done in so many anime. Kenji himself is somewhat unique, in the sense that he has a split persona that can only be released through looking at a women's panties or bra. Typical perverted character that only becomes awesome when he is perverted! The girl, Aria from which the show is named after is also a cliche, a little bratty kid who calls every guy a pervert that looks at her and wants to pump them full of holes (a line that gets tediously old after like the second time she says it) \\n\\n\r\nThe only real development she gets is that she is a decedent of Sherlock Holmes and her arch enemy is, of course, another decedent of a master sleuth, this time being Lupin the 3rd. Throwing other characters names into the mix and calling them the great granddaughters of these guys feels like the creators of the show couldn't come up with clever names themselves so instead took the names of two of the most famous fictional characters in all of entertainment.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself skips between one bad guy after another. Not really giving much insight to who they are our what their true evil plan is, Aria and Kenji defeat them all with ease. The final \"true\" villain is so uninteresting and has so little time in the show that I didn't really care if they killed him or he killed them, I just wanted it to be done! The only returning characters are the chick that is the decedent of Lupin, who's just a stupid loli that has nothing cool to do, a sniper chick who has about twenty minutes in the whole show and a Buti with magical powers that ALSO GET THIS GUYS!!! has the hots for Kenji! But she also has no time in the show at all either. \\n\\n\r\nARIA THE SCARLET AMMO probably needed more episodes to be called an actual show. But I don't think I could of watched a full 24 or 26 episode show of this. Its just so uninteresting and boring. The music is nice, going from fast pace to melancholy drama. The opening song has a nice beat and plays a lot through out each episode. I do think once Kenji goes into hysteria mode his other persona (minus the perversion) is a slick, well done detective-esc character, who does come up with interesting ways to get out of situations. Maybe a spin off show with him instead of Aria? I'd watch that. \\n\\n",

Now that I've finished watching it I have to say this anime really is bad. It did have some very good potential but the creators couldn't quite grasp it. Hidan no Aria had a good foundation, which is a high school that changes its students into mercenaries, but even though they had a good foundation in the end they didn't build the house as nice as they should have been (I hope you guys get this analogy).\r\nThere wasa lot of foolish mistake made in this and for starters there was no story. The episode started with action right off the bat, with little explanation, then the creators decided to let the main character/narrator explain what was going on. \\n\r\nAnother mistake they made, which was really bad were the characters. There was little character development and a few of the characters for some reason had nicknames of Historic people, for no apparent reason. I honestly don't even know where the creators were going with this, but I think it was supposedly suppose to contribute to the 'story' some how.\\n\r\nI noticed while watching this, the characters repeatedly kept referring to an article that I guess the school came up with. I think it was Article 2, \"Trust your friends and help when they need it\". Lolwut, is this the best they got? I honestly feel that the creators came up with the mercenaries idea, and after that they just rushed into it. Also the whole bullet proof clothes thing really did ruin this anime. If the creators allowed wounding and blood, this would have been a whole lot better. Hidan no Aria really suffered because of the creators, the name doesn't even have any meaning!\\n\r\nOne thing I noticed some people were throwing around in they're reviews was that there was a harem going on throughout this, and I have to say I completely disagree. I feel people feel if there's even one girl that likes the main character for no apparent reason then that's a harem, wrong!\\n\r\nHere's the definition that I strongly believe in for a Harem; Harem= when 3 or more girls have been confirmed to like the main character or have a strong fascination over him for no apparent reason or a not good enough reason.\\n\r\nTwo girls liking the main character at the same time is just coincidence and not a harem, so in Hidan no Aria's case, there was no harem, there was only one girl that confirmed she liked Kinji.\\n\\n\r\nBut aside from all that, the art was pretty good, the characters were drawn well and so were the guns. The background were also drawn well, the art is probably one of the only good things about this show (yikes!).\\n\r\nThe sound was alright, the opening and ending themes could have been better. As for the voice actors, there were probably only two I felt fit the characters they were voice acting, which is Aria and Riko. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all that, I did enjoy this show. It entertained me, despite the nonsense it had. I really feel this show should be given a chance by everyone, although most people who reviewed it either said \"it sucked\" or \"it's okay\", I think everyone should give it a shot.",

            "content": "Now this anime isn't anything particularly special, but I wouldn't dismiss it easily. This is a very cliche Shana (main female protaganist is a loli tsundere with powers basically) lesque harem anime, but it has its good points too. There are a few twists and turns and the anime is kept at a brisk pace to back it up as well. \r\n The story is an albeit comicly overcomplicated world that isn't very well gone into detail. It takes place with the protaganist, who when sexually aroused changes from an introverted weakling tothe opposite in so called Hysteria Mode, extroadinary powers, control, and well basically he can do everything humanly possible. Yeah, see that target 300 yards away? It now has a bullet hole in it's center. He leaves his house with breakfast prepared by the obvious childhood friend flag character, Shirayuki Hoto, to a military school described in little detail where he then would resume training for, uh capturing criminals and stuff (bear with it, the anime gets better!). Anyways, suddenly he then gets attacked by a thingy ma bobby contraption best described as a machine gun on a scooter where he frantically tries to avoid losing his life (don't worry hes the main character he's probably not dieing in the first episode), and dadadada! (Stein's gate reference) he is saved by a myserious short underdeveloped character with bright pink hair that is safe to assume to be the Shana character of this anime otherwise known as Aria Kanazaki. He then goes into hysteria mode when fanservice is accidently given to him and he then shows off to the girl with a few impressive moves and a cool attitude. She of course gets interested in him, and the rest is history they team up, meet a few more interesting characters, have little tamper tantrums where she beats up on the protaganist throughout and the anime continues from there. 6\\n\\n\r\n        I can't say too much about the art as it is decent quality in 2010 with maybe wanting a little more on the backgrounds and perhaps some of the city strips, but otherwise it is just what the anime needed. A nice, smooth, relaxed art that is to show all of the Tsundereish things  Aria does.9\\n\\n\r\n        I liked the sound alot as well, if your a Rie Kugima fan you will probably like  the main female character. The rest of the voices are pretty average especially the main character who sounds all depressed if hes not Mr. fantastic mode. The opening(s), I don't remember if it had more than one, were great and fitted the anime well. The ending had a beautiful tone to it as well and contrasted the sunnier opening well. The bgm throughought was used appropriately, but sometimes felt you wanting more. Either way it was better that most anime of this genre. 9\\n\\n\r\n        Okay, well the characters did get a little annoying. The main guy protagonist, Kinji, is kind of a depressed guy who only slowly starts to realize what hes got (the imaginary harem none have). I have never been a personal fan of the loli tsundere chacter really but if that is your thing Aria is the eptiome of it and you will love her and the gun's she produces at inappropriate times when she is embarassed. The childhood friend Shirayuki has some pretty funny lines and is very likeable, as long as you can tolerate the relationship she has with Kinji where she literally throws herself at him. A happy go lucky girl character,Rico, is very interesting and develops pretty well as the anime goes on. My favorite character and the saving grace of this cast of misfits is Reki who is a sniper at the military school/ cop school/ everything.whatever who is a quiet shy little girl and you only barely see her start to come out of her shell, but when you do it is rewarding. In total the characters blend averagely and form a pretty varied cast, hopefully some don't get too much on your nerves.You will also join some later characters whose names I am not going to spoil, but aren't gone into depth much anyways. 6\\n\\n\r\n For some reason, despite all these flaws, I really did enjoy this anime. When there was a funny scene it was downright hilarious. I encourage you even if you don't want to watch this anime to youtube Hidan no aria- I didn't get pregnant! because its one of the funnier scenes in anime I've scene and doesn't really need to be seen too much in context. Also, I plainly enjoy watching the girls fall over a guy like this in different ways that he doesn't deserve even if it is really unrealistic, it is just entertaining, and better than I think most harem portray it. The fight scenes were pretty average and relatively short, but it did shine a better light on the characters and their personalities under pressure. Also shows that the main character's two sides in contrast rather well ( if you can stand either side that is). Either way I enjoyed this series more than I expected with the combination of awkward bits of romance, comedy, stiff battle scenes, and well fan service. 8\\n\\n\r\n      Overall this anime is a worthy watch, but I wouldn't make it a top priority, Take a break watch some TV finish that really good series you haven't had time to watch yet and when a break comes, try to fit this series in comfortably because it will be worthwhile to do so, hope you like bright pink hair and a bright red face with twin guns because you will be seeing a lot of it. 7\\n",

            "content": "Hidan no Aria ...\r\nAria the Scarlett ammo ...\r\nIn my opinion this has been a very enjoyable anime.\r\nThe story revolves around our male protagonist Tohyama Kinji.\r\nThe events that happen are in a good and logical sequence, very similar to the light novel. Also in my opninion the story of Hidan no Aria (I like the name better in Japanese) is not just an ordinary story. Yes of course, it is about a dude attending a high school, but that's not what this anime is about. Especially when you have read the light novel you know this is true. Also for the people that have read thelight novel, I do recommend to watch this anime :) .\\n\r\nSo, if you are interested in Action and Comedy you should definitely watch this anime! The balance between Action and Comedy is very well done (I think more animes should balance their genres better).   . . . (8)\\n\\n\r\nAbout sound and art ...\\n\r\nLet's just put these subjects together.\\n\r\nThe art good. But I mean, come on, who cares that much about art if you just have a nice story with good development? \\n\r\nThe sceneries are always well done, but are not really the parts you need to worry about. Sometimes the backgrounds are a little empty and need more people there, but that's all, really.\\n\r\nThe sound fits the sceneries and the voices fit the characters, which of course is always hard to decide ... I think they thought this out pretty good.    . . . (7)\\n\\n\r\nOn to the characters :)\\n\r\nThe characters are very surprising, really.\\n\r\nThey definitely are not the kind of characters you would expect in these kind of genres. But putting the expectations aside, the characters do fit the events very well and I very much enjoyed the personalities processed in the characters. \\n\r\nIn the beginning there isn't much character development, but as the story progresses also do the characters and they start to mature a little bit more after each event. This is what I liked very much.  . . . (8)\\n\\n\r\nI don't think I have more to tell about the story, sound and art and characters\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the anime and the light novel so I recommend both of them, though I know there are people out there who don't like reading :P.\\n\r\nI you really don't like reading, try the manga, that's also awesome.\\n\r\nI definitely liked them myself and told a lot of my friends, who also watch anime, to watch Hidan no Aria.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end this is all my opinion, haha. If you want to confirm my opinions you should watch the anime yourself and submit a review for other potential watchers!\\n\\n\r\nBut long story short:\\n\r\nGood anime, nice balance between genres, nice story, good art and sound, unexpected personalities and good development. Very enjoyable :D\\n\r\n. . . (8)",

            "content": "If you don't like reading and just wish to know my opinion on whether or not you should watch this anime, my candid answer would be: \"No, No, No, don't fall for the trap i did and just watch something else because Hidan no Aria is mind-blowingly bad\". \r\nYou're still here?\r\nWell then, lets get into the nitty gritty. \r\nBy the way, there will be SPOILERS HERE, I know I'm not supposed to, but I can't write a review on how bad the anime was without 'em, so TEEHEE\r\nSo, lets start with the characters,\r\nThere is the VERY average anime male(Kinji), who holds the typical traits ofan anime male, who is the protagonist, which is rare because in most anime he'd be 20 feet from the camera and is rendered blurry cause he ain't worth attention. Now, he is exceptionally normal except for the fact he has a specially ability which I call the \"boner ability\". When he achieves a boner, he basically bones all enemies and becomes super smart, super brave, and super duper duper stuff. \\n\\n\r\nThere is the short girl(Aria), who plays the average short girl routine which is embarrassed about her height and bra size, and is apparently licensed to shoot anything without repercussion because she doesn't hesitate to dual-shoot anything. Also she is somewhat related to Sherlock Holmes but it give her anything. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is the rest of the characters, few male companions of Kinji who are also very average, Riko, Hotogi, the sniper, jeanne, and vlad. none of which were important till the end. \\n\\n\r\nNow the worst bit- the story\\n\r\nI liked where the story was headed(which is why I watched the whole thing) but it ended in another direction which got me disappointed and wilted. \\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are part of Butei a school for free lance police that fight terrorists. \\n\r\n-But seeing that the terrorists are aimed at the Butei, and Butei shooting up and bombard areas just shows how they improve their society which is to say of a negative effect. \\n\\n\r\nBut never-the-less they are fighting crime, which is till ep 6 where Aria decides to use the Butei for her personal gain and try to free her imprisoned mother who is sentenced to 900 some years(no im not kidding). \\n\\n\r\nThen we find out that Riko is Lupin(which gives her the ability to use her hair like hands) and Aria is Holmes(nothing) and they must fight because fictional English books affect Japanese anime in more than just humor. \\n\\n\r\nSomewhere here Aria and Kinji meet Jeanne - Joan of Arc's relative which gives her the power of ice, which makes even more sense because history and fiction go hand in hand. \\n\\n\r\nAlso around here is when Aria agrees to work with Riko who previously hijacked a plane to kill her, (which makes sense because you would work with people that tried to kill you with a plane) to steal something that Riko wants so that Riko can testify to clear her mother and go to jail herself - a fool proof plan indeed. \\n\\n\r\nEnding- Riko betrays them attempts to kill Aria(again), then gets stopped by Butei teacher, Vlad aka. count dracula who is also a werewolf. If you are drawing a big (WTF) around here its because I did too. Anyway Riko teams up with Aria and Kinji who have memories of goldfish and forgives Riko and takes down Vlad by shooting weak points marked out in nice white paint as if he was a first boss in a RPG game. \\n\\n\r\nNow if you are outraged that I didn't mention Hotogi- screw you, she wasn't important and all.\\n\\n\r\nAlso if you thought my summary of how poorly written Hidan no Aria was somewhat confusing in any manner, then for you, watching Hidan no Aria will be like giving birth to a 30 lb. baby. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've seen many \"this anime is crap\" reviews for Hidan no Aria, and felt that I, as a person who enjoyed this show should give his point of view about it.\r\nBefore I start...\r\nI'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who enjoyed this since the average rating for this show is in the 7s\r\nThis can be seen as a typical harem anime at a few glances, which is true. However, that's not all of it. As you can predict from all the guns, this does involve a lot of (gun) fighting too.\r\nStory: I think the story line is great (note: I have no problems watchingsame things over and over). The problem might be for some people is that this is a typical harem anime with all those typical females and the \"I avoid girls\" male.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is a bit unrealistic, involving high schoolers who carry guns and swords with them during school (also note that on average, 3% of the students die during their courses (only for the harshest course, but I mean, highschoolers dieing??)) However, this slight unrealistic part of the setting really does allow all of the crazy things to at least fit in (still sticks out like a sore thumb in my opinion).\\n\\n\r\nThe second problem I had with the story is that the story is too spread apart, such as psychic abilities, a special item that artificially creates psychic abilities, and most of all, the characters (which I'll explain later)\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr? \\n\r\n1.This is a typical harem anime with all the typical females.\\n\r\n2.Setting unrealistic (which I really enjoyed)\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'll keep this short since I'm not an art critic, and I personally don't see that much of a difference of art in most animes.\\n\\n\r\nSince this anime is already unrealistic, the art does fit well with Hidan no Aria. \\n\\n\r\nBut I do see many problems with it: (naming the major ones)\\n\r\n1. Too unrealistic (people manage to hide a gun about 1.5x their hand under their very short skirt.\\n\r\n2. Again, too unrealistic (their hair moves really awkwardly in mid-air.\\n\r\n3. Many  Unnecessary ecchi moments which is not in the light novel\\n\\n\r\nSound: I enjoyed the sound, that's all I can say.\\n\r\nall the voice actors fit in with the character, especially Shirayuki.\\n\r\nI loved the OP, and I skipped the EP, so I don't know.\\n\r\nI felt that the bgms fit in with the situation, since I didn't realize of the BGM's presence until I looked back.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters itself are so good I might of rated it a 9 or 10... if not for the random historical/fictional names that usually makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Tooyama Kinji is a Butei that no longer wishes to stay as one, following an incident regarding his brother, who is also a Butei being bad mouthed by media after \"losing\" his life while saving the passengers on a cruise \"accident\". \\n\r\nHe carries this special genetic trait,\"Hysteria Mode\" that allows him to be about 30x stronger and smarter when he becomes sexually aroused, but tries his best to avoid \"using\" it(hence avoiding females). \\n\\n\r\nThe main female character, Kanzaki Holmes Aria is one of the top Buteis in the school. She is the typical tsundere, cruel character who treats Kinji as a slave and decides to beat him around when she is mad or when she sees Kinji with another girl. \\n\\n\r\nAnother important female character, Shirayuki is a shrine maiden (miko) with psychic abilities. She is a great addition to Hidan no Aria, and helps create many comedy moments. She is the childhood friend of Kinji, who basically is in love with him. She is a yandere, nuf said.\\n\\n\r\nNow the part which I mainly dislike, the naming of the characters:\\n\r\nTooyama Kinji: I'm actually fine with this, but some of my friends aren't. He is based off Tooyama Kin-san, a historical Japanese cop (I think) in the Edo era.\\n\\n\r\nKanzaki Holmes Aria: This is obvious, she's related to Sherlock Holmes. She is the Fourth Generation Holmes. The problem is that she has absolutely no deducing abilities, unlike Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n\r\nMine Riko Lupin (4th): Lupin the Fourth. I think her character fits Lupin, but the part that I don't get, is that she is sort of friends with Aria. Lupin and Holmes as best friends anyone?\\n\\n\r\nJoanne the Arc (twenty-something generation): This naming has nothing to do with the character, so I dislike this.\\n\\n\r\nIt's getting long, so I'm gonna stop here, but there are so many historical character's decendents gathered in one highschool, which makes it really awkward and forced.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I liked the anime, but I felt that the anime should of been a little more loyal to the light novel, since I felt that the light novel is better. If you enjoyed the anime, try reading the novel (not sure if there are english versions, but if you can read Japanese, go for it) and you will enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can handle all the contradictions and unrealistic things in the anime, go for it. I'm pretty sure it'll be worth your 6 ~ 7 hours.\\n\\n\r\nIf you read the whole thing, thanks!",

            "content": "It's one thing to produce an anime that turns out badly, but it's another thing entirely to produce an anime that showcases a complete lack of effort put into production. Hidan no Aria is merely but another step into failure by the largely hit or miss JC Staff, but what really manages to tick me off as a viewer is the complete lack of care and effort put into the production of this anime.\r\nNow listen. I had nothing against the initial setup of this anime, I originally started watching it (And kept doing so for who knows what reason) merely because the premise seemed tobe fun, although ridiculous. It was something for me to just watch for the shits and giggles, a guilty pleasure if you will.\\n\\n\r\nI never expected tons of depth or complexity in this anime, but I did expect to be entertained. I wanted to see an anime that would be almost the equivalent of a summer blockbuster action flick, which while certainly the highest quality entertainment out there, it still manages to be a fun little experience.\\n\\n\r\nClearly, JC Staff had other things in mind. Instead of just trying to provide straight forward entertainment, Hidan no Aria was very roundabout with its approach.  An incredible amount of the show's time was devoted completely to fanservice and the usual anime tropes. Ranging from the main heroine Aria, who is yet another Kugerie Rie voiced loli tsundere from JC staff, who does nothing but treats the half spineless male lead like a slave, to the yandere childhood friend Shirayuki who dots on the main protagonist in a severely annoying manner, there was almost no character here that felt genuine or likable. I say the male lead is half spineless because supposedly whenever he gets a boner for one of the other girls he enters \"Hysteria mode\" and changes into some super skilled fighter with an arrogant, charismatic, and overbearing attitude. No joke here either.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I feel like I'm writing about some action comedy, but the worst part about it all is that this plot takes itself fully seriously. There are several supposed \"dramatic\" moments in the series where we are expected to sympathize with each girl in the main character's little harem, especially Aria. There are several times in this series where one will be subjected to Aria's toddler tantrums because of things not going her way, and we are expected to sympathize with her when all she does is slave driver the main lead with a leash.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, even if the characters suck, maybe the action and plot is entertaining... Well one of the major facets of the plot is how these famous people in the world are often direct descendants of famous figures like Holmes, Dracula, Lupin, etc. Each of them bears their own pasts and problems, but really, it's just really, really stupid. I think by the end when you see that the Dracula descendant is a werewolf you will also realize just how stupid this plot line is.\\n\\n\r\nThe action itself is often very lackluster. JC Staff's continual budget slashing just makes the show look like utter crap. Nothing about it stands out, and there's not enough of it at all. Not to mention that tons of of the action scenes are marred by again, fanservice since our main lead needs a boner to do anything productive. For some reason he is also relegated to support roles as well. \\n\\n\r\nBut I digress. What's clear to me, is that there is a clear lack of effort put forth by JC Staff that is pervasive throughout the entire anime. The fanservice is hardly stimulating, especially when most of it is from a loli pink haired girl. The action lacks punch, and there is far too little of it. And worst of all, each and every character is an anime archetype or trope executed in a very uninspiring manner. \\n\\n\r\nIf the creators of the show aren't even trying to make me like this, why should I? \\n\\n",

            "content": "Hidan no Aria or Aria the Scarlet Ammo is hardly an anime that could be judged by its name or by the genres mentioned here. To put it straight the anime does have action and comedy and school but its hardly the main part of it, its all about girls and guns (and swords) and the cliched over-used recycled gibberish scenarios (hence the G-shock). As a matter of fact, neither girls nor guns nor both put together made the anime any good but a lot of us (including me) are sucker for these types and thus the popularity.\r\nThe plot is set in a school thatgrants special students permission to take up missions and engage in combat using arms and ammunition. So you get talented snipers, gunmen, sword masters and special ability users produced by the school. Our protagonist, Tooyama Kinji, after a sad incident has decided to quit the combat division and live a normal life when suddenly he gets involved with a killing incident, a girl falls from sky, and activates his 'Ero-super-mode/ Hysteria mode' by contact with the flat-breasted Aria to set off the new course for his life.. so you can see :\\n\r\n1-sudden accident \\n\r\n2-girl falls from sky (special girl=cloud, these days) \\n\r\n3-perversion=power and \\n\r\n4-rescue heroine :all 100% checked for predictability.\\n\r\nAfter being persistently sought after for his Hysteria mode (activated by ecchi stimulation and heightens his senses out of his urge to protect females) he decides to help Aria absolve her mother from false accusations.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is surrounded by a flat chested tsundere, a plump yandere childhood friend and a femme fatale as a starting dose to his harem, hopefully the other female encounters will also enter into harem cruise if they dare to make a sequel. The plot throughout is quite predictable and strewn with your usual harem scenarios, depth and mystery are hardly much of a factor and most scenarios are mediocre or dumb or both. Therefore, as an intellectual facade to give a perception of depth and mystery they decided to use the offsprings of famous characters- Holmes IV, Lupin IV, Jeanne de Arc (was it 38th ?) and the Dracula himself who was generously available due to his immortality. Except that Holmes IV has more intution than deduction abilities, Lupin IV has to use others to steal, Joan of Arc 38th can use ice and of course! all of them are girls. By the way, Dracula is a 'stupid cur with black-and-white fur' (a werewolf like creature with white spots on his otherwise brown skin to mark 3 of his 4 weak spots --FYI that's so you can kill him easily). If they thought that they could create a masterpiece by stuffing something from everywhere they couldn't have been more wrong.\\n\r\nSeriously, the story could hardly have been good when the basis itself is flawed. I regard the story as mediocre and generously award it a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\n[spoiler.. on a side note the last episode really pissed me off; Vlad, the EU no.2, great villain, is actually a dumb wolf, defeated in less than one episode. At last, at long last they f***ing ruined their own credibility.]\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is not so good. The character sketches are good for the most part, the coloring scheme is good. But, the animation fares poorly, for one the scenes are not so fluid, they seem cut-off sometimes and another the angles are definitely not the best they could have given. I don't think they spent much in the animation department cause although the guns and characters are well made the action scenes don't come out as great. The backgrounds aren't spectacular either.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department is fairly better than the others. I don't have very sharp ears to analyze the quality of voice-acting and BGM and grade it qualitatively but I consider most of the voice acting as good and the BGM nice though not spectacular. The OP seemed good to me, the ED was good and had a great accompanying animated scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe character zone is also starved and plagued with stagnation and cliches . Kinji, the male lead is a retarded and weak student with a hidden potential due to which he is either coveted by or recklessly thrown in the midst of dangerous women. A masculine instinct to protect females gives him the strength to survive. The female leads include a flat-chested tsundere loli Aria with the greatest potential to sexually excite the hero, a yandere childhood friend madly in love with him and a dangerous seductress bent upon using him for her own devious schemes. The rest of the characters are also derived and hardly have a hint of originality. The development follows - the predictable route to a classic harem. Well, since Aria plays a greater in the plot, her development is comparably better.\\n\\n\r\nYou can see how much of a hypocrite I am since, despite all the scorn and cynicism, I still gave the enjoyment a 7/10. That's because, even though it's full of shortcomings, I still like the anime because of its comedy-harem nature (not that i watch every harem but I do watch a lot of them).\\n\\n\r\nAs an overall opinion, if you're into it because of mystery or action or something new, I suggest you drop it and watch better ones. On the other hand, die hard fans of harem are always welcome.. come friends, no matter what happens if it has an H its a Must-Have, if its a Harem its a Must WatcH.",

However it is let down by its mediocre story and characters. \r\nStory (6)-\r\nEver wondered what it would be like to become a mercenary and save the world? Well I have and I was quite interested in the plot synopsis, so I watched it and I wasn't disappointed. The action was solid throughout the whole thing and so I enjoyed it, however the plot couldn't be more generic. Bad guy, mystery, Big boss , beat big boss, The end. That's basically theplot and so it was a bit of a let down in total.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and Art (7)\\n\r\nWell the characters aren't flat so its good, however they do fall into some stereotypes, the protagonist being strong only when it counts, tsundere partner, the innocent looking bad guy and etc. They're quite well designed and their animation is quite good, so it was well above average. There were a few flaws in the fight scenes, but nothing to hate.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8)\\n\r\nBetter than most, fitting music and OP, ED aren't totally generic and are quite enjoyable\\n\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\r\nIt's a 7.5 for me, its interesting and I believe that the light novel develops the plot into something much more exciting, however that may be due to the allowance of length. Its enjoyable and the setting is unique, so if you're looking for a good action/bit of romance its not a bad one to look into.",

            "content": "Aria of the scarlet Ammo was a fun watch. A school operating to train armed detectives. There are car bombs, and traps, and undercover work\u2026 Theres even classic names like holmes, Lupin, dracula. The issue is, Hidan no Aria becomes incredibly average.\r\nWhenever I look at the the score sheet the 'average' next to the five sticks out to me. Why? There are so many things that can make a show average. It is very unfortunate that Aria appears to implement all those. The end result is this show becomes more of a guilty pleasure, than anything else. Let us examine our male lead. A normalButei who upon getting sexual arroused becomes powered up. In a long line of lists for stupid but amazing powers, Kinji's hysteria mode is actually among the top. He sure is kick ass when he is in it, but it still leaves you asking why it has to be like that.\\n\\n\r\nOf course the answer is fanservice. I have nothing against fanservice, the guiltiest pleasure of all, and Aria is not short in this. There is romance mixed in, but  unfortunately that line of the story hits a roadblock as soon as it becomes a harem, and to make it better or worst one is a tsundere and the other a yandere. Although I will give it props for actually throwing kisses out there too bad it doesn't really made jack squat.\\n\\n\r\nNow thankfully you can't really do the action scenes wrong. There are plenty of fights in Hidan no Aria, and they are all pretty good. Sword fights, gun fights, gunkata (youtube it? I didn't know it already existed). It actually wasn't that bad, although the final boss is an immortal with Achilles's heels and is pretty lame. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is okay covering about three arcs in total. The first one is the introduction of Aria as she is impressed by Kinji's hysteria mode and asks him to help her fight back against a car bomber who targets Butei. The second involves protecting his childhood friend who is also at the top of their class from an assassin, and to finish it off the third arc is an undercover operation. The introduction to the arcs are fun to watch, but  the aftermath feels slightly underwhelming, especially when they implement the 'befriending' idea in a show where they arrest criminals. It makes even less sense then usual.\\n\\n\r\nHidan no Aria was a guilty pleasure. I enjoyed watching it, but when you reflect back on it you realize how bad it is. Of course instead of dropping shows I always finish them so perhaps I can still enjoy the mundane. However, as much fun as it was I can't really put this above average.",

            "content": "This is a review compiled by the members of the VIA (Value In Anime) Graveyard Division. All members who have worked on this review are mentioned at the bottom. In addition, this review will also contain a \u201cValue in the Anime\u201d section detailing life lessons and values that make this anime worth watching.\r\n-------------------\r\nHidan no Aria is a relatively recent anime that, while rated poorly, has lessons that can be derived from the experience. \r\nStory: We mostly agreed that the plot was good at the beginning. It was interesting, it was engaging, and it was amusing. Less than halfway through the series though, the plot startsto go downhill. Some of the sub plots, such as the characters being descended from the famous and infamous were notable, though it isn't expanded on. Quickly, the plot switched to an episodic set-up, which led some of us to feel as if we had suddenly skipped a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the other prevalent plot devices, such as the bullet-proof uniforms seemed to have no purpose other than as a comedy and action device that allows for okay comedic and action scenes. The uniforms lowered the tension, as they force the viewer to think that there is no way anyone can die. Violence, overall, is treated nonchalantly. \\n\\n\r\nThe show seemed to promise some speck of realism at first, though this is set aside as the plot introduced characters with superpowers. We felt this was a completely unnecessary addition, as the plot was interesting and fine without super powered people running around. It is also rife with plot holes, and the motivations of the villain(s) are never fully explained. It is cryptic, in an extremely unflattering manner.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation wasn't bad. It lacked huge amounts of stills or jerking. It was fluid and fight scenes looked nice enough. The backgrounds were decent enough to take a second to look at, but no more than that. The characters designs were a little bland though, and there was nothing outstanding about it. There was no individuality to the animation. No creativity or anything to set it apart from all other anime. It was good but it was nothing new.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening song was nice though the OST was nothing special. While it did help set the mood and tone at some points, it didn't play to the mood well. We did, however, feel that the seiyuu did a good job on this anime, though our preferences differed. The seiyuu were able to make us feel the emotion of the characters well enough, creating a memorable performance. You could call them a saving grace.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This, however, was one of the weakest points of this anime. It could have been strong, given proper fleshing out, however the effort was not made. This is a harem anime, but we did not see the purpose of it. All harem members degenerated into clich\u00e9d templates that disappeared as soon as their roles were fulfilled. While one would expect this to help the main relationship be fulfilled, it did no such thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Aria and Kinji seemed to be a very strong and based off of a solid, mutual understanding, but this bond between them seems to only exist to be broken. The main character\u2019s \u2018second personality,\u2019 Hysteria Mode, is often used as a bad plot device. Our reactions on this personality are split, but we agreed that while amusing to watch, Hysteria mode existed as a fail safe for the writer--an example of lazy storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: We all agreed that this anime was at the very least somewhat enjoyable to watch. As with many things, this was especially true in the very beginning. However, as the plot degenerated, our enjoyment followed suit. We started to enjoy this anime less and less as the plot became episodic and filled with moe and fanservice. Even the fight scenes got harder to enjoy as violence in this anime was treated so flippantly. \\n\\n\r\nValues in the Anime: There is value in this anime that makes it worth watching--certain life lessons that we can all take to heart.\\n\\n\r\nTrust in Your Friends and Allies: This is a point thoroughly covered throughout the anime, and is even said multiple times by the characters. While not true all of the times, trusting in your friends, your family, your allies, are things that humans need to learn. Trust is an important human value, as no one can do everything alone. Even if it\u2019s hard, and even if some people will betray you, learning to trust and share your burdens with people will lead to an easier life.\\n\\n\r\nViolence is not a Toy: Violence is repeatedly treated as nothing more than comedy in this anime. Guns are carried like phones or pencil cases, and they are used just as frequently. It is hard to take fight scenes seriously because guns are waved around so much in the lighthearted scenes, and because of the bulletproof uniforms. However, violence is not a toy. It is not something that should be done just for fun like in this anime. Guns should not be waved around and shot every other second simply because other people probably won\u2019t get hurt by them. Always respect everyone around you, and use violence as a last resort.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10 (Not an Average)\\n\\n\r\nVIA (Value in Anime) \u2013 Graveyard Division\\n\\n\r\nTo find the true gem\u2019s in anime!\\n\\n\r\nVigilate et discite!\\n\\n\r\nOfficer \u201cKami_no_Kage\u201d\\n\r\nAgent \u201cMoros_Fate\u201d\\n\r\nAgent \u201cfortepiano\u201d",

And of course, there is cliche moments...the guy sees the girl naked.  Big woop.\r\n[9] Art: J.C. did well here.  As expected.  I haven't seen anything outstanding though, so I'll leave it as a 9.\r\n[9] Sound: Voice actors and actresses, amazing.  Openingand ending themes were outstanding, I thought they fit the anime well.\\n\\n\r\n[5] Character: Here's where I rant.  If you don't know or haven't noticed, the characters are UNORIGINAL.  Ever watched Shakugan No Shana or Toradora?  The voice actors are the same from Toradora main characters to Hidan No Aria main characters.  Sure, they're amazing VA's, but what hurts the most is the similar personalities.  Aria strongly resembles both Shana from SNS and Taiga from Toradora.  What makes me mad the most, is that in episode two, Aria is saying 'URASAI URASAI!\".  I MEAN WAHT THE HELL.  THAT'S SHANA'S LINES.  THAT'S JUST A NO NO.  Aria's personality is generic too.  She's tsundere, raging and hitting and yelling before slowing revealing her soft side.  Frankly, she's annoying.  She beats up the guy for no reason sometimes.  Also, she tells the guy to be his slave.  Strong resemblance towards Toradora.  This guy, I don't even remember his name, but I said before he had hidden potential.  Just like Yuuji from SNS.  I suppose it's a bit different, but all this unoriginality is messed up.  I hate it.\\n\\n\r\n[6] Enjoyment: Idk.  I felt like it was a 6.  Mainly because of my favorite voice actress",

            "content": "Why does J.C. Staff think their idea of comedy is funny when it really isn't? This is why no one likes them anymore. And Aria the Scarlet Ammo (Hidan no Aria) is yet another piece of awful on their ever-piling list of mediocrity.\r\nThe premise seems interesting enough. You have this school where students are trained to become mercenaries and law enforcement and such. The main character, Kinji Tohyama, attends this school and he has this strange power that makes him more badass, but it's only triggered when he gets sexually aroused. No idea how that exactly is supposed to work. Anyway, he's relunctant to becomea Butei and wants out. One day, he's attacked by a remote-controlled armed segway and he's saved by the titular character.\\n\\n\r\nNow here's where it gets bad. Let's start with the main reason why this series is awful: Ms. Aria H. Kanzaki herself\\n\\n\r\nAria is supposedly an S-Rank Butei, which is the highest rank a Butei can achieve. Can you tell? I can't, because she does absolutely nothing worthwhile throughout the whole run of 12 episodes. To make matters worse, she's nothing more than an awful carbon copy of that other tsundere. Extremely tsun, Has a flat chest and complains about it, physically abuses whatever poor unfortunate guy has to put up with her, Voiced by Rie Kugumiya. I don't care about her trying to clear her mother's name for a crime she didn't commit, because she acts like a childish, annoying, unlikable brat; I just wish someone would just smack her in the face, already.\\n\\n\r\nThe other females aren't good either, but at least they don't threaten to pump you full of lead every time.\\n\\n\r\nBelieve me, as much as Aria alone can kill anyone's enjoyment of this series, that's the least of the issues here. Some major characters are revealed to be descendants of various fictional characters like Sherlock Holmes, Joan of Arc, etc. Aria is Holmes' descendant, hence the H in her name. Does she perform any interesting deductions? Nope. Is Joan of Arc's descendant vulnerable to fire? Kinda, sorta. In fact, none of that goes anywhere. It's just tacked on for no good reason.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is adapted from a light novel, you'd expect it to cover as much story as possible in 12 to 13 episodes. But while most light novel adaptations have a sense of closure and sometimes leave you wanting more, this one does none of that. It ends with the same unfunny antic that makes you think if J.C. Staff had given up on it.\\n\\n\r\nIf this show doesn't convince you that abusive tsundere characters like Aria are flat characters (chests notwithstanding), I don't know what will. If it weren't for her, this would've been at least an average series with interesting premises that goes nowhere.",

            "content": "Hidan no Aria is the cousin of Shakugan no Shana. It's made by the same studio and has a lot of the same elements as Shakugan no Shana. The difference is that it takes place in a more realistic world, and instead of swords, characters battle with guns. With all of that said, I enjoyed Hidan no Aria very much. I enjoyed it as much as Shakugan no Shana, although for different reasons. Shakugan no Shana had great storytelling and characters evolving over time. Hidan no Aria is more about dumb fun. It's stupid, yet, entertaining. \r\nThe story takes place in a time where anelite group of detectives, known as \"Butei\", are the watchdogs assigned to take down crime. One of the detectives is Kinji Tooyama. There's nothing too special about Kinji, which is why he gets the surprise of his life when he is targeted by a man known as the \"Butei killer.\" Luckily, Aria sees this happening and comes to save the day. Afterwards, they form a friendship and decide they must do whatever is necessary to take down the \"Butei killer\". This is an okay story for a series, such as Hidan no Aria, but it goes downhill later on. While the majority of the series takes place in a realistic world, the end goes into fantasy territory and becomes a bit ridiculous. Again, if you switch your mind off, you'll have a good time. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the animation, Hidan no Aria is beautiful to watch. Knowing that, I found it odd that Hidan no Aria didn't look as visually pleasing as Shakugan no Shana, which came out more than four years beforehand. Some parts of Hidan no Aria looked better than others. In particular, the scenes during the OP are beyond amazing. I just wish the entire series looked as good as what was shown during that opening.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the OP, it's phenomenal. Easily one of my favorite OP's of all time. The song is extremely catchy and totally fits the mood of the series. Usually, I skip OP's after seeing them a few times, but not with Hidan no Aria. I always watch the entire thing. It's masterful work! The ED is good too, yet, I wanted more from it. When it comes to the music used in the actual episodes, they work well. Nothing too memorable. Of course, that's not a bad thing. Better to not be memorable than something that is remembered as bad. \\n\\n\r\nAs for characters, Aria is great, but the fact of the matter is that she's an exact copy of Shana. If you loved Shana, you're going to love Aria. Period. Since I fall into that category, I had no problems with Aria whatsoever. She's a tsundere character and does exactly what most tsundere characters do. No surprises. Oh, and she's also related to Sherlock Holmes. Why is this important? It's not. \\n\\n\r\nKinji is pretty much an exact copy of Yuuji from Shakugan no Shana. I guess Kinji is a bit of a stronger character since he's a detective and all, but that doesn't say much. One thing I liked about Kinji is that he has something called \"hysteria mode\", which happens when he gets pleasured by a girl in some shape or form. During \"hysteria mode\", he pretty much becomes a bad boy and takes risks he wouldn't normally do. It's stupid, but fun. \\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters as well, but they seriously aren't very important. A lot of them are part of the series for fanservice. Honestly, the series would've been better off without them. They don't really add much. One of them in particular, Riko, is rather dull. She's introduced as a strong character, but seems to lose that sense of relentless during the second half of the series. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the negatives I have, I still loved Hidan no Aria. I can't recommend it because I know that only a small portion of people will truly appreciate such a series. You literally have to turn your brain completely off and just go with the flow, no matter how crazy and stupid things get. If you can do that, you'll enjoy Hidan no Aria quite a bit. It's nothing you absolutely have to see though.",

This is like a story about kids that go to school that teaches you to kill, but you can't kill anyone(even though the characters are shooting at each other all the time.) They do missions for people that need their help, because society sure needs the help of gunfighting children, screw the police or army. There are also other rules like some good ol' clich\u00e9 ones like \"never leave your friends behind\" and other similar ones.\\n\r\nAlso, the main character gets all pumped up when he gets to see some skin and. It's called \"hysteria mode\".\\n\r\nOh and also, there are also other ridiculous superpowers mixed in there.\\n\r\nOh and most of the characters are like the grandchildren of famous historical characters.\\n\r\nOh and we should totally get Kugimiya Rie to voice the obnoxious and loud leading female character, the character is written just for her.

            "content": "Tokyo Butei High School\u2014It\u2019s a special school where armed detectives, also known as \"Butei\", armed detectives in training are being brought up. Tohyama Kinji is a junior student who has the unique body which activates a Hysteria Mode. It\u2019s supposedly a genetic condition, when Kinji gets sexually aroused. He turns into a \u201cmega playboy\u201d with superhuman judgment and reflexes. The end result is an extremely suave change in personality. He tries to hide it to others in order to live a peaceful life. But trouble comes to find him when he becomes a victim of a bombing incident, where he meets the Butei high \"Assault\"department elite, Aria H. Kanzaki.\\n\\n\r\nStory & Characters (1/10)\\n\r\nIn the near future Japan, teenagers learn to be a Butei, an elite force that specializes in arms and hand-to-hand combat, at Tokyo Butei High. Toyama Kinji is a Butei, but he doesn't want to be. Just as he makes up his mind to leave, however, he stumbles across an anti-Butei Killer and needs a rescue from the fiery, gun-toting Aria. She's tiny, she's skilled, yet she has the temper of a little brat, and after seeing Kinji \"transforms\" into his hysteria mode, which is a flirtatious, damsel-rescuing prince, to turn the table and rescue her, she wants him to be her partner. Together they battle the Butei Killer, go to school, and get tangled up with other forces who have evil plans.\\n\\n\r\nA little hope can be a dangerous thing. Take Aria the Scarlet Ammo. Its first episode had a few glimmers of interest, so we spend the next six hoping that something will come of them, only to be crushed at every available opportunity by brainless fluff plots and excruciating harem capers. Genre tropes aren't bad by nature, but the way a few series carry and blow them into something unexpected is worth watching. Bad ones use tropes as crutches, to allow them to hobble without doing the work of manufacturing their own appeal. This anime is one of those. One minute Kinji declines Aria's offer of partnership, then a childhood friend who hopelessly mewls over him bursting in to create one of those must-have-harem-comedy, then the next Aria's spouting she's a direct descendant of some badass historical figure. Wow, talk about another facepalm. Wait a few moments and Kinji playing a center idiot in the harem, and suddenly he's a retro hero with the allergic cool look and professional womanizing skills. The entire anime is littered with the corpses of failed harem adaptations; Aria isn't making canny use of its tropes; it simply is them, blown up until they can't be ignored... or enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the main characters; like any show that names itself after its main character, it's fair to say that everything should be laying on the shoulder of its main character. However, Aria isn't a tactical role. She has a frail moe look contrasts to the great skills she possesses, and is indeed indeed to any of Kugimiya Rie's many diminutive tsunderes, but only a resemblance. She has none of the genuine traits or any of the depth of Kugimiya's heartbreaking character; she's a parody, and not a funny one. Her anti-Kinji personality is a typical trait to reveal the insecure, cute and cuddly girl tacked onto the end like a particularly phony afterthought, and somewhere in there there's a few scenes in which she's desperately in need of rescuing despite she claims to be the best Butei at school helps absolute nothing.\\n\\n\r\nAria is clearly an action series mixed with harem, which itself should sound a warning bell. Kinji is a straightforward harem lead, who has the personalities of one and acts like one. His hysteria mode, though is a funny one, is still a cheap trick. The other two heroines are shy miko Shirayuki and lust-addled (gentlewoman?) thief Riko. They're all superior martial artists, and all hopelessly smitten with him. Turns out they're all descendants of some historical figures like Aria, and lousy ones, too. Each represents a superior harem trait, and they aren't just a string of pointless rumbles, but an oddball of tale.\\n\\n\r\nArt (4/10)\\n\r\nIt's the strategic focus of the fights, however, that really gives one hope. They're part of a battle, which despite its controlled nature and lethal weapons, still has many of the opportunities for strategy, betrayal and trickery that a real battle would have. Aria and Kinji's battles are good action showcases, pumped up with nice visuals to portrait the daily battle in the life of a Butei. Unfortunately it isn't all there is to the episode. There are characters to introduce, which generally involves a big dramatic entrance and a quick survey of each girl's loli-flavored character design.\\n\\n\r\nThe only sign of life is the show's dumb slight of gags, which is admittedly spotty but also contains hints of fanservice. When Riko makes her escape by using her own uniform as parachute, revealing her busty body, or a matter of concern about Aria's flat chest or screeching at Kinji for being a pervert, are all a silly joke and a mean to pique the interest of the people who would enjoy things like, well, small girls with big eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\r\nTsundere specialist Kugimiya Rie returns to voice the character type that she specializes, but she was just simply reprising her role for Shana, and to be paired with Majima Junji, who she has chemistry since Toradora! and whose characters are just a mere copy of the old one proves to be weaker. They are veterans enough, however, to confine them mostly to invisible supporting roles, so you're unlikely to notice unless you're specifically listening for them. The music score does try its best to pump up the pace and energy, but it feels worn-out like a half-hearted effort.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10)\\n\r\nYou hear it a lot, you watch it a lot, and you facepalm because of it a lot. It takes a while for the series' amusement at its own genre-pandering, trope-plundering ridiculousness to register, though. There's very little in the way of humor during the first episode, and the way it lunges from one cliche to the next, taking little care to properly connect them, makes it much easier to cringe at the towering derivation of it all than to laugh at it, much less laugh good-naturedly. Oh, and just to kill things a little more dead, the villains are both random and really, really annoying.\\n\\n\r\nSome series fail because of a lack of anything fresh to work with; others fail because of deficiencies in execution. Aria the Scarlet Ammo squarely falls into the former category. It doesn't have any good ideas and does not do anything to make a new start, and is not sexy enough in the way it does them, to be entertaining as anything more than an ignorance.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Do you like hentai?\r\nDo you like badass gun wielding lolis? \r\nHow about yuri?\r\nIf you answered yes to any of these, this is the anime for you. \r\nThis anime is all about detectives and action\u2026 and boobies. It involves a high school known as Butei High, where teenage kids can go live out their badass fantasies of fighting their way through Tokyo and being legally allowed to carry a gun and break shit with it. Most detectives that go here are literal shit unless you are an S rank, the highest you can go. Who needs normal education ammirite?\r\nAria the Scarlet Ammo is about, well, Aria.She is a descendant of Holmes and is an S rank Butei. She\u2019s the badass loli who will fuck all shit up and leave nothing standing in her way. Her ability to break shit and make it look cool is seconded by none. Eventually she meets Kinji Tohyama, who is also an S rank, but is a lazy bastard who doesn\u2019t want to do much of anything. That is\u2026 until he sees boobies.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole premise of the story revolves around Kinji\u2019s ability to see boobies and get turned on. Once he\u2019s in his mode, he becomes the perfect Butei. This gives him the perfect excuse to get a face full because he will just go and save half of Tokyo afterwards, meaning no one bats an eye at how he did it. Not only can he become a badass upon sight of boobies, but he can (anal)yse any situation he\u2019s in and decide how to act in a split second. He\u2019s also a great shot. \\n\\n\r\nAs Butei continues to be threatened by dumbass terrorists who think they can win against a flat chested loli and a horny highschooler, these 2 must do something about it. Not only are they threatened by terrorists though, as crazy (hot) yanderes join in the threat, and maybe even the ones they know could be threatening them! The story has many twists and turns with solid development, and the action is more than enough to keep your attention. Not much feels out of place as the developments happen.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the series is how Aria's and Kinji's stories develop. Their relationship is a unique one among anime as they fight badassily. The accurate emotions they feel, Aria's inability to tell just how Kinji might feel, and Kinji's ability to be lazy in general is entertaining and will leave you wanting them to grow closer.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is perfect. Nothing to complain about here. Move along.\\n\\n\r\nSound? Who the hell comes here for sound? (If you must know, the intro and outro give it a good \u201cHolmes\u201d feel, and the voice actors do a great job of drawing out emotion in each of their characters.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is good shit. A very recommended series for those who want a little extra in their life at a PG-13 rating. Heh.\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr: Lots of lewds, embarrassed lolis, horny high schoolers, and yanderes make this a series worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nDisclaimer: Aria best loli girl\\n\\n",

The foundation of the story are strong, the characters design are good, the art are well-drawn (especially the weapons), the sounds are fantastic.\r\nThe settings are: students went to a special school in Japan which trained mercenaries. A lot of people are, well, not pleased with this saying it's too unrealistic. Lemme remind you guys that this is fiction, it's fictional! Wherethe hell in the world that have a school, training high school students to become mercenaries?!\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are basically the descendants of all the famous families in one way or another.\\n\\n\r\n-->The male lead which have a certain circumstance called \"Hysteria mode\" which turn him into a super whenever he's sexually excited, this plot, some says cliche which the protagonist gets power from something perverted, there for, he's a pervert. But actually he's not a pervert at all since the beginning he already state the fact that he had a hard time dealing with girls and they overlooked that.\\n\\n\r\n--> The female leads, which are descendants of Sherlock Holmes, Arsene Lupin and a long line of Miko(s). As for this, they says it cannot be related since the design are much too different, well, I've got a thing or two to say about that. Originally, both Sherlock Holmes and Arsene Lupin are fictional character which were created by Conan Doyle and Maurice Leblanc so what's wrong with creating the descendants which are different from them?! Not always do the descendants have to be better than the head of the family. As for the Miko(s)'s descendant, this character is totally fictional so I don't have anything to say.\\n\\n\r\nFor the storyline, they says it doesn't fit. I'm not trying to offend or anything but I don't think you guys have brain if you says it doesn't fit. It fits perfectly and may as well remind you what I've already said at the beginning, this is fictional!\\n\\n\r\nAnd one more thing, if anyone interested in watching this, the original light novel series are definitely the thing for you!\\n\\n\r\nP/s: I'm deeply sorry if this review offended anyone, I don't have any intention of sort so I hope you guys can forgive me if I did.",

            "content": "I'm probably going to receive a lot of hate for this review since the voice actor that shall not be named is voicing her common tsundere role, but anyways, I'll continue.\r\nFirst of all, you have to realize that reviews on MyAnimeList can be, at times, very unreliable, due to the fact that many people say. \"I love this anime, omg this guy gave a review criticizing it, better criticize his/her review by clicking not helpful.\" I'm always like: It's called Helpful or Not Helpful, not Agree or Disagree.\r\nMoving on, Hidan no Aria is another tsundere, romance, action, fantasy anime done by J.C. Staff, so nosurprises that there is harem in this anime. Personally, I don't care if there's harem in an anime, so I couldn't care less, but I've always had a soft spot of harem romance animes, especially with this one. Hidan no Aria was one anime I was very excited for, since it included my favourite genres, and it look like it had a promising story line and stares a cute anime girl as the main character. \\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen Zero no Tsukaima or Shakugan no Shana, you'll probably get a sense as to what Hidan no Aria will present you with. A guy doesn't want to do this or that or get thrown into another world the doesn't want to be in, and falls in love with a girl and bam, you have a tsundere romance + harem.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, I particularly enjoyed watching Hidan no Aria. The story and plot may have not been the strongest suits in the anime, but I found the animation to be very fluid. Here and then, I see reviews saying \"Oh the animation isn't realistic\" Well a couple years ago everyone fell in love with Dragon Ball which compared to now has crappy animations and those other animes, but no, today it's all about realism and how realistic the drawings or character movements are. Personally, the animation in Hidan no Aria for me was very fluid and eye-pleasing, and I would give it a solid 10 in Art.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Hidan no Aria is definitely not the strongest soundtrack J.C. Staff has done, but it's above decent. I liked it, and found it often set the atmosphere very well for action scenes. I give Sound an 8. The opening is kind of catchy, but it's really a matter of your own personal taste.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Hidan no Aria are not very unique, in that there are similar to the past tsundere romances J.C. Staff has done. However, they od have likeable personalities and not to mention the multiple cute anime girls this anime throws in. In terms of character development, well, there's not  much room for character development in 12 episodes, which is why I want this series to have a Season 2. You obviously see a change in the way Aria (the main character) treats Kinji (the main male character) since it is a tsundere romance. Other characters also develop somewhat, but are otherwise not as noticeable. To me, character development didn't really matter because I watched this with the mindset of this being a cutesy tsundere action romance anime, so I give this section a 6. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, even though the anime may not have been original, I would say its definitely worth your time to check it out. If you have disliked the past J.C. Staff tsundere romances such as Zero no Tsukaima or Shakugan no Shana, this one probably won't be any different. For some inexplicable reason, Hidan no Aria is an anime I enjoyed a lot more than I thought I would based on my impressions from the reviews. I give enjoyment a 9 and overall rating of 9. It may not have been ground-breaking or moving or a deep plot, but it had all the elements that I was watching for which was basically action, romance, and just that kind of casual anime to watch for the cutesy stuff and comedy. Comedy is very well-fitted with this anime. \\n",

            "content": "Alright, this is my first review so here goes nothing.\r\nI for one actually liked Hidan no Aria. I have watched many anime in my time, from ghost in the shell to sailor moon to zero no tsukaima and while it is generic, there was something different about it that drew me in.\r\nLet's face it the story wasn't particulary inspired and the art was not the standerd i'm used to and the charecters were completey unlikable.\r\nAnd i think thats why I enjoyed it as twisted as that seems. Aria is a spoiled brat which is why I like her, she isn't the typical hero i'm usedto even though she could fall under your typical tsundere. She treats people like dirt at all times though I ended up feeling sympathetic over her mother. You can see how she ended up so uncaring and bitter.\\n\\n\r\n The male lead Kinji also falls under the unlikable category and yet once again he makes interesting for me. His casual, frustrating sarcasm is so different from what i'm used to in this sort of anime. His hysteria mode is obviously of  multiple personality disorder and uninspired and yet I'm greatful for that. To often advance modes and forms take over an anime, completely smothering it.\\n\\n\r\nRiko is manipulative, impulsive and sadistic, but I couldn't help but narrow my eyes with Kinji when she acts innocent. Its generic, she has to be up to something, but what next, how will she betray them next because she has to. I can't help but smile when I realised how right I was.\\n\\n\r\nAll and all the story is not complex which is perfect for some light viewing though it occaisionally requirs comedy relief to keep you interested.\\n\\n\r\nI rarely if ever care for an animes art work though it can add a little bit extra to the experience. Though I wouldn't let that take away from my own viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is important in anime. I have been known to acquire GB of official soundtracks and I was disapointed by its soundtrack which was a blur, you could not careless as one track went to another.\\n\\n\r\nAs may have noticed I like the fact that the charecters didn't have to be  likeable which I enjoyed immensely. It was one of the none generic parts of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, It was an enjoyable viewing experience which I would recommend to anyone who wants a change of pace in an action and comedy anime that still manages to be light viewing, even if it does have an unique sense of humour.",

            "content": "Hidan no Aria is, for the lack of a better term, a complete letdown for fans.  There were high hopes for this series coming off a popular manga, which explains the ever popular \"queen of tsunderes\" Rie Kugimiya starring as Aria H. Kanzaki.  But in the end, it wouldn't have mattered if the entire cast were filled with all-stars.\r\nSexual humor with a shallow plot led by annoying characters a good action-comedy anime does not make.  Unfortunately, this is exactly what we get out of this show, and while we weren't exactly expecting a masterpiece here, the production team could have at leastgiven a little more respect to the series.\\n\\n\r\nFanservice is just a part of what we see in anime nowadays.  But there is a big difference between good fanservice, and bad fanservice.  Good fanservice is there on occasion, acting as nothing more than eye-candy that appeals to a certain audience.  Bad fanservice is there all the time, and the anime tries to sell itself completely on that material.  Hidan no Aria is filled with the latter, while trying to amuse us with flashy action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's any part of this series I liked, it's the music - though the show never lives up to it.  It's fast-paced and actually makes the action scenes temporarily enjoyable, but don't let that fool you - it's just pulling you in for more \"Girl gets in trouble, girl gets Kinji horny and sends him into hysteria mode, Kinji saves the girl and the day.\"\\n\\n\r\nIt's that kind of formula that sends Hidan no Aria into a tailspin.",

Usually i do a \"One episode trial check\" when i just watch the first episode before watching an anime. it passed the trial test with flying colors, and i decided that it is going to be a good anime. \r\nThe story is an interesting twist on the generic \"girl meets boy, girl decides to live with boy, other girls dont approve\" harem setup. The powers of the characters are pretty well distributed, and have an interesting activation for oneof the characters. there are quite a few different plot twists that surprise, but the story ends in an cliffdrop \"to be continued\" type ending with no definite ending.\\n\\n\r\nthe visuals are great, the girls are pretty MOE, and the overall art style is great. the characters look nice, with good facial features, and the explosions and action scenes are well drawn. \\n\\n\r\nThe sounds are pretty good, with pretty good soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is great, the characters (although visually generic to anime) are well developed and unique. the character traits have interesting twists, and there might be a few unexpected character changes.\\n\\n\r\nthe story is enjoyable, the characters are fun, it is not a very serious anime at times, but at others it gets very \"edge of the seat\" serious. this whole anime was great, and the only thing that puts a damper on the story is the lackluster ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall its a good and interesting anime, with fun, slightly ecchi, haremy, action, shooting and very serious bits at various points. just when you think you figured the story out, there will be a twist that will surprise you. \\n\\n\r\nLAZY REVIEW: Good Story, Fun and Action with some dramatic bits. Interesting anime, that will appeal to many different types of people. Highlight: characters, Lowlight: Wishy-Washy inconclusive \"to be continued\" ending.",

Even though the genre mixture of Action, Comedy, Romance, and School can work fine together, you still have to be careful with it.\r\nYou can have a anime that has lots of action and serious moments, and plenty of comedy, you just need to know when to place where.\r\nI'll be straightforward, stuff I didn't like:\r\n-Out of place/Too much added and bland comedy.\r\n-Characters\r\nI probably would've enjoyed this anime more if it was just a episode-by-episode anime (Iliked how the OVA was) about Main-Boy and Tsun-girl go with highschool pals and complete missions together as Butei. But unfortunately no.\\n\\n\r\nWith anime like this you it's hard to have both cliche anime comedy....and adding the \"serious moments\" into it too, it makes it hard to take seriously, with the added fanservice during those \"serious moments\" doesn't help it either.\\n\\n\r\nThe other issue is with the characters, most of them are reallllyyyy ANNOYING.\\n\r\nI would have been fine if the characters had begun annoying, but gradually developed into good characters, but that doesn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nLet's take Aria for example, she's being the standard, abusive tsundere loli, she gets into a couple SHOULD-BE \"personality-changing moments\" with the main guy, she should change at least a little bit, at LEAST her view on him. But no, she still acts like a b.\\n\r\nOnly thing that changes is she likes him a lil bit, but is still an asswad to him!\\n\\n\r\nJust in general, one part of the show I feel like had potential was its story shift. But it also could've done way better, so I don't actually like the story shift, I just like the concept...a little.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the majority of the characters being revealed as descendants of history-making people from Europe, and them all having ancestral grudges to each other, was actually pretty interesting. I haven't watch AA yet, but if it expands more upon this, I feel like I would enjoy it more.\\n\\n\r\nPretty much, this anime is....ok depending on how you look at how the genres are executed. I hope AA can redeem this series, but I will say I don't really expect it too.\\n\\n\r\n(Also the OP was plain for me at first but then it grew on me lol.)\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 5\\n\r\nART: 6\\n\r\nSOUND: 7\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 5\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 6\\n\r\nOVERALL: 5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Before I start, there are two things that must be said...\r\n1. A review, by definition, can be both a reflection upon the article writer's personal opinion, and a reflection by an over-all perspective of a certain story, event, etc.\r\n2. That means that flagging this as \"not helpful\" simply because I state my personal opinion(s) is rather ignorant.\r\nRight, on with the review.\r\nSome might say that this anime was cliche, easy to read, boring, blah, blah, and blah -- and hey, I agree! But to me the second most important thing about anything is how much I enjoy it from the very beginning to the very end;quite frankly, I enjoyed this anime a lot from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\n(I'll leave the story review at the very end, for those of you who don't want to run into any spoilers) \\n\\n\r\nSo, let's start off with the art (8/10):\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n(I'll leave the story at the very end, for those of you who don't want to run into any spoilers)\\n\r\nPersonally, I liked the art a lot. It's like a mixture of IS: Infinite Stratos and Highschool of the Dead. \\n\r\n...Not much else to say about it, am I right? Since this kind of art is my favorite, I decided I'd give it a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound quality (again, 8/10)\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the voiceovers was superb, but then again, it's FUNimation. I thought that the occasional comedic sounds in it's proper placement was rather hilarious aswell, especially this one scene where the main character opens a drawer full of panties and horror-epic music begins to play.\\n\r\nThis leads to the next part of the sound review, the music. The music in this anime was quite good. The intro and credits were decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, I'm a big fan of Kinji and Aria's voice actors (Junji Majima and Rie Kugimiya, fun fact -- they voiced Ryuuji and Taiga in \"Toradora!\"). I loved how the characters reacted to eachother aswell, it reminds me a lot of Zero no Tsukaima. The reason I gave it only 8/10 though is because I do think that it's a bit cliche, and I already knew what was going to happen... but none the less, I always love these types of characters interacting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nI give enjoyment an 8/10 for the following reasons: though this anime is cliche, the action scenes are fast paced and fun to watch. The comedic romance will have you actually expressing emotion (atleast, it did for me) by either groaning at someone, loving, facepalm-ing, WTF-ing, or just being straight up annoyed with someone for a bit. I'm also sort of a sucker when it comes to lolis and the main muchacho being lovey-dovey with eachother, I know -- gimme a break.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this anime an 8/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\n... Alright, story review up ahead. Don't continue if you don't want to be... eh... well, spoiled. >.>.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT\\n\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT\\n\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'M NOT JOKING, THERE'S A SPOILER AHEAD\\n\\n\\n\r\nSO... you want to read it?\\n\\n\\n\r\nRIGHT?\\n\\n\\n\r\nOKAY THEN:\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (5/10)\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nTo be fairly honest, I was watching this anime more for the comedy and romance. I was never really attached to the story like I would be for anime like Brave 10, Gundam, Code Geass (i.e: serious anime xD). For this simple reason, I gave it a 5.\\n\r\nIt starts off with the heroine speeding down a hill with a bike with a uzi-mounted-uni-cycle-machine. I wonder why? Oh, what do you know. A bomb. -_-. The twists involved in this story were also very easily saw through aswell... and the fact that Aria (a pink haired loli) is \"Sherlock Holmes VI\" and a short, big breasted blond is a direct decendant of some other detective (I didn't even care to follow after I saw the part where this was revealed, I was facepalming too hard). Oh, did I mention that Joan of the fucking Arc was in this anime aswell? \\n\r\nYou get my drift now, the story sucks.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review. Hope you found it helpful! If you're trying to find a serious anime with serious romance... TURN AWAY. NOW. Your only reaction to this will be\\n\r\n\"What the hell am I watching?...\"\\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, if you're looking for romantic comedy without caring much about a story... I guess this is for you -- welcome to the club.",

            "content": "So this is my first time ever writing a review, but I really wanted to talk about this anime.  I even wrote the summary for wikipedia on the 12th episode because nobody has written one for a few of the episodes.  So now I will get on with the review.\r\nI have watched about 20-30 anime in completion now, mostly ecchi and action stuff.  This of course is both.  At first I wasn't going to watch the anime because it has guns and for some reason I get very bored when I watch anime with guns and with robots (none in this(no offense lol)).  I had been trying to find a few anime to choose from this season of anime and randomly picked this one.  Best decision of my life lol.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is original in its on way.  There are many anime about people who go to some special school for like martial arts or shooting, but this one was quite different.  It didn't really focus on school too much like the others and was very fast paced.  Kinji and his hysteria was also something that I liked a lot.  I don't know why, but it really got me.  The story though was great and I really loved the humor and at night while I watched, my dad was yelling at me to shut up.  I couldn't stop laughing.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the art style too.  I am pretty picky and normally judge books by its cover by looking at the art style.  All though I respect many old anime, because of the way they are drawn such as lupin the 3rd and such, I get bored easily but they were good when they came out i guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe different characters were very good too.  I loved how the characters were all so different and you got to the feelings of almost each one.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is definitely going in my favorites and I recommend it to everyone looking through this season of anime that is coming to a close.  Sorry this review kind of sucked because its my first one and i talk about non-important things.  Hope I helped :).",

            "content": "The Story:\r\nThere has been a recent notification that a murderer is killing Boutei, a term for students of the Boutei Academy, who solve crimes or are trained in weaponry to solve problems.  The story unfolds more in action sequences then anything, basically, this character is introduced, then another is, wow, they have a beef with their individual families, etc. The story is pretty exciting! Without spoiling, I will say you will enjoy it as certain weapons are introduced etc.\r\nThe Art - is very different from what you would call \"generic\" anime, the characters are drawn differently, in a more seasonal way, and the actionscenes just fit well with it. While the shadowed drawn parts may TRY to make the character seem sinister, it just comes off as cute to me with how its drawn. Its definitely fascinating to compare Hidan No Aria to other anime such as Clannad, or Kokoro Connect.\\n\\n\r\nThe music really didn't do much for me, besides the opening, which had chanting. Chanting really does it for me in music, its amazing once theres chanting in there...but, the opening music for this show reminds me more of a roman-like setting when its really in a setting for boutei and action.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters become lovable overtime, and so does the main protagonist. I will say, anybody can like these characters and their banter between one another. As situations get worse you find yourself asking, I wonder how this character is going to react etc.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime alot. I enjoyed it more when I watched it, and then went to read the manga. The only problem I had was the overall pace. Things go by a little slow, especially if something big is revealed, the characters don't act on it as they are presented they would be.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend giving this anime a watch, and if you liked it, read the manga. It has just the correct amount of comedy and action for my enjoyment, I hope it does for you too!",

I'm not an \"anime scholar\", I'm just expressing my humble opinion. \r\nI've just finished the entire series and I must say two things: I started watching it because there was a tsundere and it wasn't an utter dissapointment. It's entertaining, period, nothing more to add in it's favor.\r\nIt isn't groundbreaking in any sense, in fact, it seems to be something made in haste, trying to put together several elements we all like... And failing at it. Not miserably, though. Maybe  some more dedication in the plot, a little more dedication in character development, and a lot more episodes couldhave been the difference between \"mediocre\" and \"very good\". Nevertheless, I seriously doubt that the premise (\"Super-cops High School\") would earn something more than an 8 from me. It's like chocolate and pizza: each one is great, but together, they suck.\\n\\n\r\nI'd only recommend it if you have nothing to do while waiting for the next episode of Shakugan no Shana III (like myself) or if you are a tsundere fan (me, again).\\n\\n\r\nOver and out!",

That just leaves us with the story. \r\nThe story is a great tale and while not the most original, does it in a way that keeps it fresh and keeps you interested. The anime has its best moments at the beginning. The problem actually comes at the end, or to be more specific the last episode. While I do love this anime and would watch it nearly any day, Ifeel I have to be blunt. The ending is the worst ending I've ever seen in my life, anime or otherwise, arguably worse than Avatar's. The ending is just so out of left field that I don't think I can think of a reasonable argument to defend it. The whole story follows a single plot line and you do get the feeling, even from the beginning who's going to be the \"final boss\". However this anime decided it wanted to have a twist ending, the problem is its so much of a twist the viewer is left with a million questions, none of which are answered. \\n\r\nNow I don't mean to scare you away from the anime by any means, in fact this is a more highly recommended anime I give. Its just that the ending can not be overlooked, and while I do re-watch this anime on occasion, I usually skip the last episode and just insert a better plot twist in my head.\\n\r\nEither way, with exception of the ending, the anime is a cool action thriller that has elements of mystery that keep you in suspense, and the banter between the two heroes is always enjoyable to watch. I recommend it so check it out if you get the chance.",

            "content": "Scrolling through reviews, I was almost turned away from this anime. But one thing I find interesting about a lot of these reviews is now petty some of them can be at time. Such as if an anime doesn't conform to their view of the perfect anime is, it's trash. I however like viewing anime with an open mind and I love to turn people onto decent anime. Not perfect anime, but anime you can sit down and watch and enjoy, laugh, smile,  feels something . Anything at all. So I'm going to review this anime and I hope my review inspires you towatch and decide for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime Is not too complex. It's actually very funny, but also very quirky as well. Basically a school exists for people who are interested in certain fields of combat/investigation. Our characters are decendants of people of legends such as Sherlock Holms and Lupin the Third. Which is an interesting concept to me. It's a fairly simple story which leads up to a nice little reveal and ending that isn't too hard to swallow. It may be a bit off the wall at times, but it's anime. Anime isn't to always be based in reality. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is normal. Nothing too out of the ordinary. It doesn't shine or throw anything too catch my eyes besides the choreography.  I'm also going to say the sound isn't too bad as well. It all fits for this type of anime. There isn't happy music when something sad is going on. It's not blowing me away with an orchestra and sending me on a beautiful trip.  It's plain,  and that's ok.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a bit bland and follow anime tropes to a T. Which I'm ok with. You won't be subjected to feels but you will get a good laugh here and there. Voice acting was standard. Nothing would make this anime any more normal except maybe a perverted male friend who constantly gets our MC in trouble bur...its fine as is.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy it? Heck yeah. I laughed my tail off. The story is fine,  sounds and acting were average and the characters may have been bland but I'm not a perfectionist. Something that makes me laugh and smile and is enjoyable to watch deserves praise. And this anime in all its averageness deserves praise for being highly enjoyable if you are looking to kill time and have a good laugh. I recommend it if you want to smile a bit and want to see something to get down off of those deep ride anime that send you on a rollercoaster of feels.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a downtime anime when you wanna chill and relax. Not a complex story, no deep characters. Just a good old time to be had.",

            "content": "So I came with big expectations to this show. I really thought, that it would be funny - and the first episode did this job pretty good. But after that : it just became horrible.\r\nI want you to know, that I even watched 7 episodes of this bullcrap, before writing my review. But with every episode the story became more and more a compilation of clich\u00e9es and bad plotwist - no bad is not the right word. They were pathetic. \r\nFirst of all, lets make a short Overview of the grid from my review:\r\n[1] Story\r\n[2] Artstyle & Logic\r\n[3] Animation\r\n[4] Sound\r\n[5] Characters\r\n[6] Enyojment\r\nOkay so here itcomes: Hidan no Aria, one of the most dissapointing animes ever to be watched. \\n\\n\r\n1) The Story beginns somewhen in the 21. century - at least it seems like it does. Why does it only seem? Because they don't even give a complete watch over the city. Anyways: In order to stop the problem of upcomming crime there was a group called the \"Buttei\" founded. They are somekind of soldiers who work like the police in order to remain safety for the citizen. BUT they work for money. Well you know the police-officer from the neighbouerhood also gets his wage every month. \\n\r\nMost of them are children (don't ask me why - they probably think that it is cool)\\n\r\nNo really - there is not a actual matter WHY they are still childern - it makes no sense in no way of sight. There are plenty of Girls wich are really really clich\u00e9e-based and their characters are sooooo flat - a thing you can't tell about their chests. Yes: nearly every girl - no matter if she is just 14 or 18 years old - they all got tripple Z over 9000...\\n\r\nSo then lets continue: The \"Buttei\" have a ranking based on their skill-levels. A concept that is so well known and there were so many ways to make it interessting: but they failed. It's just nonesense.\\n\r\nThey have a problem - a self-claimed \"Buttei-killer\" is on his pseudo-bloody trip of ripping the buttei appart with doing terror-atacks. Oh yeah well you know - instead of just blowing random bikes up etc. you could just fuckin' blow up the whole island. Yes: the Buttei have built a artificial Island on wich they have built a giant school. What? Thats totaly normal.\\n\r\nAfter 7 episodes it just makes me wanna cringe and cut out my brain - the pain is just to much for me.\\n\\n\r\n2) Okay so lets continue with the artstyle: It's okay. It's not something special, there are no real overthought color-palets or anything like that: they cust painted their world a bit with a standart 24bit color-program. And it doesn't even match. Yes I know - its from 2011 and digitla-painting wasn't as developed as nowadays. BUT there are shows from 2006 wich did a better job at this - so its just failing also on this point. There are some detail-works - especially on the bra's or skirts of the girls. \\n\r\nThen there are a huge amount of logic fails: okay - you don't know wich I mean? Let me tell you some of them:\\n\r\nEpisode 1: a girl jumps from a roof of a building with about 7-8 floors. That would be about 30 meter. Yes. She jumps - falls about 1-2 seconds and THEn opens her parachute. She would have ended as sludge on the concrete. \\n\r\nThen there are these moments when they shot. Okay I understand they are super high equiped and trained killer-elite fuckers. BUT: how can you manage to avoid a bullet at 1400 feet or nearly 500 km/h. With a distance of about 15 metets (episode 1 or 2) or even less (episode 4,5,6) they would have to react within 0.1 to 0.036 seconds. WELL FUCK.\\n\r\nAlso: you can't cut a bullet in halfes with a sword or a knive and even if you would manage to do some with idk your magical-dick-mode or whatever he uses (yes he has to get horny to get into that mode) : They bullet would not fly apart that fast that it wouldnt hurt you. It you still rip you apart cause of a distance of aproxiamtely 0.25 meters (farthes) or less (more logical). \\n\r\nThen - yeah of course if a car flips it explodes instantely. NO IT DOESN'T. \\n\r\nA bomb with about 3500cc of plastic-explosives - yeah of course it makes a 60 meters high fountain of water and a explosion of more than 30meters in diameter when exploding UNDERWATER. No... jsut no. Please die whoever decided to make this happen.\\n\\n\r\n3) They where okay. The main animation was still acceptable - but the cgi. They used standart-explosion animations from things like windows-movie-maker in a DRAWN world. They didn't even manage to draw a plane of so - they animated it: and they did horrible. \\n\\n\r\n4) Well the original-synchro is okay. You can't really say something bad about it, I don't have to rage on this one. BUT the opening soudntrack for example: it is just shit. IT's soooo dreadfu and aaah no I just can't stop bleeding from my ears when hearing it. Sorry but I had to skip it after the first time in order to protect my ears from getting cancer. \\n\\n\r\n5) There are no really special characters. They have no real story wich is somehow new or even interessting: they just packed a train full of shit and let it go - and it crashed and hell yeah: it crashed hard. Every-single girl in the show is a over-sexualized version of a doll with giant boobs, no real character nor a development. They are just useless. Then: oh yeah the boys, The main-character is okay. Not good but also not as poor as the rest. You can life with him. Only thing: why didn't he jsut shot the fucking girl when she was starting to tell her evil-plan and her relation to his brother Nii-san and the EU. Oh ps: thanks for pulling the European Union into dirt ;) I'm sure you didn't even overthing what the EU is. Anyways. All the other boys are not even there to be a part of the story. They are just fillers to tell bad news or make horrible comedy. Do you get it? It's a harem with bad action, clich\u00e9e girls, shit story, plotholes of the doom, forced and bad plottwists, appealing music and hell of a lot pain for my brain. \\n\\n\r\n6) The first episode was really okay - i even laughed. But afterwards it becomes really bad. I mean - really really bad. \\n\r\nI'd rather watch Euphoria than this show. \\n\\n\r\nI think they did a horrible job. They had a well known but still interessting concept but they've ridden it with full speed into a wall and then tried to make a show out of the bit's of crap that was left. \\n\\n\r\n2/10 overall",

            "content": "Ok, this is my first review so keep that in mind. the main reason why i'm writing this review to question why people dislike this anime so much, i don't think is all that bad, if u're looking for the reason why skip to the last paragraph. It's not the best anime ever but it was defiantly enjoyable. i get how the world/setting doesn't really make sence the some people with a school full assassins, thieves, and super powered shrine maidens who carry guns and katanas. but i think u can over look that, i mean i didn't even think about that when i startedwatching the show.\\n\\n\r\nsome people think that the Sherlock Holmes, Lupin IV, Jeane of Arc, and Dracula stuff is totally unrelated, stupid and shouldn't in the anime but so what if aria and riko are ancestors of  Sherlock Holmes and Lupin i didn't care about that at all. i guess they could have named the antagonists something else instead of Jeane of Arc and Dracula. but again, i just overlooked it.\\n\\n\r\ni can understand why people didn't like the characters too well they did some pretty stipid things like ordering people to be their slave, locking the door and asking to have sex in the school grounds, putting a penicle in ur breasts etc but isn't that what a romantic comedy anime suppose to be like, i mean i could name so way worse perverted stupid scenes in other animes like Seikon no Qwaser, Sora No Otoshimono and high school of the dead. i do agree the Hysteria Mode thing was pretty stupid though.\\n\\n\r\nthere was one character that i hated and that was kinji, i mean seriously, they drawn him so badly to the point where it really didn't make any sence for any of the girls to go for him. he is totaly incompetent and a total idiot, except in Hysteria Mode but even then he's pretty bad. \\n\\n\r\nBut overall i don't think this show is all that bad, really. Reason being i like the action/romantic comdey genre and i liked the characters Shirayuki, Riko and Reki. i like how riko says her name, her recklessess, her unpredictable character and her combat skill. i like Shirayuki because of her combat skill and her emotional character and i like reki because of her emotionlessness. so that's the reason why i don't hate this anime. it certainly keept me entertain which is the main purpose of any anime. And i think the action scenes were done very well.",

            "content": "Note: I may possibly be overrating this anime since it is the first one of it's type that I have watched. Take this into consideration before deciding if my review is helpful or not.\r\nArt (8/10)\r\nJust what you would expect from an anime in 2011. Nice detail and color used in virtually all scenes. With this being the first anime with guns that I have watched, I may have overrated the art a bit. Despite this, I truly do believe that the guns and bullets were animated quite well. The way they bounce off and hit objects looked real for the most part. Solid artwork overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\r\nAt first, I thought that the stars of the show were only going to be a loli tsundere female and a useless male protagonist. I'm glad that I was wrong. With the addition of a yandere (Shirayuki) and a kuudere (Reki), along with the seemingly bipolar Riko, I found the nice variety of personalities extremely interesting. For the most part, I found all the characters likable in one way or another. Yes, even a yandere like Shirayuki (whom I hate) had at least one good point in her character. With each of the aforementioned females having at least one episode that centered around them, the series became more interesting. Although they had limited screentime, I felt that the other side characters (Mutou and the rest of Assault) didn't get enough character development. However, I understand that since time restraints may have been the cause for this. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nThis time, I'll focus on the voice acting first. With Kugimiya Rie and Majima Junji (Taiga and Ryuuji in Toradora!) pairing up once again, it felt a bit nostalgic when I heard Aria and Kinji speak. Aside from the excellent voice acting, the other sound aspects of this anime fell short. Although the OP and ED are not terrible, they are certainly not memorable. The BGM felt like it wasn't even present with the instrumental version of the OP being played at the most critical scenes. After accounting for all of this, the voice acting by itself wasn't able to impress me enough to increase my score for this category. \\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10)\\n\r\nAfter reading the synopsis, I was given a brief idea of what this anime would be about. The idea of a loli twin-tailed tsundere wielding pistols and fighting against evil with the help of a \"sometimes skilled\" partner sounded generic but interesting. However, I was quite surprised at how the story developed. Yes, there were some really predictable and lame scenes but I was quite forgiving since this was my first time watching this type of anime. According to others, this adaption was done poorly but since I haven't read the LN yet, I'm basing my score on what I saw, regardless of what happens in the LN. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nA decent anime overall. Nothing too spectacular but it didn't bore me to death either. With a great variety of characters and a interesting story, I enjoyed watching Hidan no Aria. As for a second season, I don't really mind if there is going to be one or not. If there is, I will definitely watch it since this season met my expectations. The somewhat cliffhanger ending was a bit annoying though. If you got nothing better to do, just give Hidan no Aria a try. There's a chance that you may like it despite what many critics say about it.",

            "content": "This is an anime that I didn\u00b4t drop for three reasons:\r\n1) I wanted to see if Aria and the MC would end up together. I always want to find an anime that ends with the main heroine and the MC as a couple, even better if the heroine is a tsundere, because it\u00b4s really hard to find a complete tsundere route.\r\n2) It has an upcoming second season and I needed to see the first one to be on the same page. I\u00b4m not saying that this next season of Hidan no Aria will be good, the plot is not too complex at all, but Iwanted to see how the producers make the story revolve around the same MC again even if the new plot-device character is only there dor Aria.\\n\r\n3) The kuudere or just kuu sniper girl. She had a lot of potencial, the classic too good for the MC to be with female character that does awesome stuff every scene she\u00b4s on.\\n\\n\r\nI kinda liked the MC\u00b4s hysteria mode, how it triggered and everything, but with the progression of the series they made it less epic in comparison as the first chapter, wich was a let down.\\n\\n\r\nApart from this three points there\u00b4s nothing outstanding or even apealing for the show. I really desliked how try-hard it felt when they mentioned the whole *aria middle name* stuff and, oh lord, the *villian identity* part, the  \"Then you are *villian identity* right?\" part, ugh, that killed the little hope I had with the villian, wich was predictable as truck since the chap 10 or so.\\n\r\nAnother thing that I found wierd was the panty shot censorship, at least on the page I watched the anime. Maybe I\u00b4m use to panty shots so I\u00b4m no longer affected by them, and when I see obsious censorship I think \"wow, for japan to censor anything? this must be some serious sheet\", but I found the censorship a little out of place.\\n\\n\r\nOver all not a great anime, but well, it could have been worse",

            "content": "Hidan no Aria was one of the anime that was in my summer quota a while back. To tell you the truth, I had really good expectations for this anime, since a lot of my friends recommended it. Sadly, those expectations were quickly dashed. One thing I don't like in an anime is bad storytelling. And oh boy, was it bad.....\r\nIn the first few episodes, it was pretty solid. All of the settings were established cleanly. The characters were introduced pretty nicely. And the story itself was good. But after awhile, things started to go in a totally different direction. A hunt for a notoriousdetective killer suddenly turns into a paranormal quest to destroy Dracula? Really? I was really wondering what happened to the director's sense of direction. Maybe it could have worked if they added more episodes to at least lay down a good story foundation, or they could have changed it into a different setting entirely. Some of the main characters in the Manga and Light Novel were even degraded into measly secondary and supporting roles. What was Takashi Watanabe thinking?\\n\\n\r\nAnd the plot twists were also horrid. But if they had used their twists well, maybe they could have redeemed themselves even by a little bit. Sadly, that was not the case. They had the opposite effect actually. Most of the plot twists were horrible and completely not needed. Well, maybe some of them did work. But the fact still remains. It was bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was sort of disappointing as well, though I didn't mind it at the time. Although they managed to show the feelings of the scenes they were portraying, it was.... unsatisfying. It could have been better, really.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty good. Yet it wasn't anything special. The OP and ED were catchy, and I found myself listening to them time and time again. I even learned how to play Kameria no Hitomi during the summer. Honestly, the OPs and EDs seemed a bit better than the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus were also pretty sync with the characters. Especially Rie. I have always been a fan of her voice acting, along with other Tsundere voice actresses. She really gave life to Aria and her \"tsun-ness\" (forgive the term).  \\n\\n\r\nI don't really think I can recommend this anime to any certain group of people. I did enjoy a bit of it. I was disappointed in the end though. But it did receive a good amount of recognition, considering it made the cover of some Anime Magazines. If your one of those people who like action-harem anime without a solid story line, I guess you could check out this anime then.",

            "content": "I think people are being way to harsh on this anime. Because I enjoyed it pretty much. I'll explain thoroughly. Check the overall review for just a quick explained one.\r\nStory: 7/10 Butei's. An Martial Art Orginations that train High School Students to masters of weapons. These students are trained into something like an \"Super Police Force\". The butei's works like a police force, and throughout the series the act like one, including arresting people and have the same basic rules as police enforcements.\r\nIt's just that Butei's are trained to an unnatural level. Some students have got some supernatural powers through Blood Genes and families whooften relate to famous people like Jeanne d\u2019Arc 500-2000 years back, Which persons they are blood related to have no bigger difference. So the writer have had a little fun, took our world, throwed in guns weapons in a High School making it kinda a Training Facility, also alternating the past for Blood Genes Powers.\\n\\n\r\nAnd we follow mainly 2 people, Kanzaki, Aria H, and Tooyama, Kinji. Kinji have a supernatural power to kinda, \"super heightened\" all senses to a supernatural level. Making him one of the best Butei's in the school. The school also have the Butei's in ranks, S-Rank, being one of the highest. Which Kinji is better then the most powerful S-ranked, Aria, in his Heightened State called Hysteria Mode. This mode activates when he basically gets enough turned on by a female body. Mostly, Aria activates it the best for romantic reasons.\\n\\n\r\nSo! :D\\n\r\nMostly all side-plots relate to the main story.\\n\r\nI, in no way can say if this is Original or Not. But it's a new story with different settings and I found it very unique to my watching experience.\\n\r\nYou get to see a lot of perverted stuff and comedy. The main plot can be deceiving what it is until maybe half the episodes. But none the less, the side plots are good action, good comedy, slightly ecchi feeling, but it's not ecchi. If it ever comes to boob action, the sometimes have censored with big annoying white beams. It's just perverted comedy. \\n\r\nIt somewhat like an police serie, (but don't think its anything like one) where you have your side plots that revolves mostly in-front, while the main plot hangs in the back, continuing little by little in between until the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art is not great, but absolutely not bad. Everyone resembles High School Students, the school uniforms does suite the idea of an High School Training Facility, as I would call it. I've noticed a little that it's cheap at some points, but very rarely. The models of the eyes (especially the female ones) are new to me, which gave me a more unique feeling to this anime.\\n\r\nNot in any way, should you have problems watching this art. I enjoyed it a lot. It's great, but in ratings in terms of detail and time put down to the art compared to masterpieces. It's an 8.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is really discussable. It's not original, but it has a nice flow to it. I don't like the gunshots in the opening music. It totally ruins the feeling of a good music. Especially when the gun shot sound is awful just by itself.\\n\r\nBackground music, I honestly say, it's not much focus. It gets the job down and it's good. But I can't remember anything of the background music. (even now after writing this review, i watched the final 5 episodes) The Opening is to me very remember-able though.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting.. Personally, when I started watching this series, I didn't want this High School loli type because I have seen a lot of these, and I liked it in the beginning, now it's just annoying. OfCOURSE the voice actor for Aria is Kugimiya, Rie, if you don't know who she is and the kind of voice she does the most, she voices the heroine, main female character for Toradora, Astarotte no Omocha!, Hayate no Gotoku!, Shakugan no Shana, Zero no Tsukaima and many more. All of these have a very similar heroine in matter of personality. It's like they took the same girl, and put a different set of clothes on her.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThis Anime is a harem even though it's not in MAL details. You have one guy, namely Kenji, and he is the only guy you will see. One or another guy comes in rarely. \\n\r\nAria, as explained before. Nothing original at all. But fitting. Kugimiya, Rie is a excellent voice actress regarded highly in the industry. But these loli, short-tempered, small breasted heroines are not fun anymore. But that does not effect the ratings in my opinion.\\n\r\nThey are more main characters, Mine, Riko. Hotogi, Shirayuki.\\n\r\nThe characters all have unique personalities and everyone gives you different laughs. Riko is the girl who likes kinji in a perverted way. Shirayuki is the one that loves him and protects him with her life. One great harem.\\n\r\nYou will get conflicts between the girls because everyone want Kinji for themselves. I personally love these kinds with conflicts of love in all ways. Perverted, funny, and so on. And it is what you will get.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEven if this series had some downers that is not even worth mentioning, it was a great series and I expect a second season. I laughed a lot, this is comedy mild-ecchi and super funny. Good action with martial weapons and guns, good side plots that turns out to all be a part of the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nOverall, it's a well deserved 7. Could easily be 8. You will get Action with martial weapons and guns. Comedy revolves around a harem type where all the girls like the same guy (funny girl fights that get really serious and conflicts), mild ecchi-comedy, you wont see underwear frankly anything, just a little bit, then it's censored. Side-plots that revolve around the main story, all good and funny. I enjoyed it a lot and I'm looking forward to the second season if one is to be made.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to people whom like action and harem. If you don't like ecchi, i would say don't watch it. This is more a guys anime then girls. But it's also up to the individual.",

Even with some problems.\r\nThere are a couple things that are wrong with this but i'll just list a couple. \r\n1. The MC for most of the season is kind of annoying and an idiot. He also tends to be really rude to his childhood friend who has a crush on him and is nothing but nice. \r\n2. There are a good amount of stories that are brought up that are never resolved orare given any actual effort put into some. Even near the end we are introduced to a character that we've never seen before and is hinted has a history with the MC yet we are only given two scenes with her that don't provide anything. \\n\\n\r\n3. There is a love triangle happening and these tend to always help ruin my opinion of the show. This get's kind of annoying but not the worse i'v seen of this happening.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOver all i found this a pretty fun story if you don't take everything way too seriously. This tends to have a lot of comedic and serious stuff in it so there is a fine line on whether to take this seriously or just watch it for fun.",

            "content": "Story\r\nThe story of Aria The Scarlet Ammo is very basic. Kinji Tohyama goes to a school for butei, or as we like to call them in America, detectives. He ends up being targeted by the Butei Killer who tries to take him down by attaching a bomb to his bicycle and sending killer segways with machine guns attached to them after him. As you can tell, this anime doesn\u2019t take itself very seriously. He meets a pink haired girl named Aria and together they go on wonderful adventures in order to clear the name of Aria\u2019s mother, who has been sentenced to jail for thousandsof years because she has apparently been pinned with the murders of every person in the world. The mother part is never fully explained and makes no sense whatsoever. As the series progresses we meet Shirayuki, a girl in love with Kinji and jealous of Aria; Riko, an insane girl who dies a  lot of sexual advances on Kinji; and Reki, a rather quiet sniper girl. The show is divided into three story arcs over the course of its twelve episodes, four episodes dedicated to each book.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, as you can tell, is not too good. It\u2019s like a summer blockbuster film in that it has a very loose plot that is just there to provide for tons of action and adventure. And Aria does deliver in the action and adventure department. For those wishing to have something to think about or wishing for a more story driven adventure, this isn\u2019t where you want to go. It\u2019s like the Transformers of anime, only with less explosions, less giant robots, and less Shia Lebouf.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s this subplot about Kinji\u2019s brother that we never hear much about, and something about an ex-girlfriend  that is hinted at during episode eleven, and shown in episode twelve. The problem is, these things are not resolved and in order to get the resolution I\u2019ll have to read the books which you can read a translated version of thanks to some fans, but it is not the tightest translation and the books read more like a script trying to be a novel.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nThe animation of the show is beautiful and you can tell that most of the production funds went into the animation (though the story was already in the book, so they didn\u2019t need to fund writers as much I guess). The animation is perhaps one of the shows strongest suits. From the beautiful backgrounds to the well drawn characters and fluid action scenes, the animation is great.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound is good. The opening is a typical J-pop piece but it\u2019s not at all bad. The ending song is also typical, nothing stands out there. The voice actors are good and add to the comedy and few emotions displayed throughout the series. The sound is another good point of the series, but there has been better music in anime before.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to get flak for this, but I enjoyed all the characters. They were not totally fleshed out, but they each had their own quirks and silly things about them that made them more likeable despite some of the genericism. Kinji is a very typical anime male surrounded by a bunch of girls; he\u2019s bashful and denies everything concerning romance. His quirk is the fact that when he pops a boner, he goes into Hysteria Mode, when he is super suave and can fight like crazy. It\u2019s a silly idea, but I thought it was quirky and funny. Aria is Kinji\u2019s main love interest and she\u2019s the great great grand-daughter of Sherlock Holmes. She is searching for a Watson and finds Kinji. She\u2019s a slave driver and comes across as bitchy but she is scared of lightning and thunder and I guess she\u2019s a typical teenage girl if you gave a bashful teenage girl two pistols.\\n\\n\r\nShirayuki is in love with Kinji and is a priestess who can do crazy stuff with her sword. She\u2019s very bashful yet is always trying to bed Kinji. She\u2019s always fighting Aria and when Shirayuki interacts with Aria, it\u2019s always funny.\\n\\n\r\nRiko is the great great grand-daughter of Arsene Lupin and she has this weird quirk where she can use her hair as a weapon. It\u2019s stupid, sure, but it doesn\u2019t not fit in with the rest of the series. She\u2019s the only character that you can feel any sympathy for because of a childhood problem we learn later on, and she also is the only character that has any sort of development. It\u2019s not a lot, but there is some.\\n\\n\r\nReki is a quiet sniper girl. She has very few lines and doesn\u2019t do too much in the series, though I would have liked to see her more. She was the only truly badass character. The rest were kind of badass, but they also came across as funny and silly so it negated the badassery.\\n\\n\r\nThere are three bad guys in the series. One of them I\u2019ve already described. The other two are not well developed at all, and are just bad guys. Nothing much to them, just something to shoot at.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nAria the Scarlet Ammo is, in movie terms, a popcorn movie. It\u2019s got little substance, but a lot of flash. It looks good, it has great action, but its bad guys aren\u2019t that exciting and the characters are all there to be complete opposites of each other and provide comedic relief and some tension during fight scenes. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not good. I loved it. I liked all the characters in some way or other, I liked the action sequences; everything but the story.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s frivolous fun. It contains a lot of juvenile humor concerning boobs and boners, it has that typical anime thing where we get lots of shots of thighs and cleavage for no reason but fan service, and it has fun action sequences. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s not something for the guy looking for story, it\u2019s not something for the girl looking for meaningful action and romance. If gone into with the right mindset, Aria can be a good way to blow a few hours. If you go in expecting something with tons of substance, then you\u2019ll be disappointed.\\n",

All of the characters are relatively likable, as they each show a different asset of skills. All in all, I very much liked this anime as it was very enjoyable as long as you take into mind that their willbe plot holes as the series only covers a small part of the whole thing.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: After finishing the series, it feels like it's only half done.

            "content": "I must say that I am not quite the regular ecchi watcher, so my opinion will be stated from the viewpoint of a regular otaku, gomen.\r\nThis anime bases on the existence of the Butei, a society of private detectives that function like a creed of law enforcers. I find such plot idea to be really interesting, and the anime explores it with adequate measures.\r\nNow, the male main character, Kinji, is the regular kind of apathic guy, that seems to be almost a clich\u00e9 on ecchi animes, this attitude of his annoyed me at first, but on the roll of events, he becomes a better person,and this is quite pleasant to see.\\n\\n\r\nSaa, I would enter in details regarding the girls involved, but I think it may be better if I refrain myself from doing so and just give a quick insight on her personalities to avoid spoilers. There is, in order of appearance: Shirayuki, a gentle, seemingly innocent girl. Aria, tsundere, loud mouthed and the main character. And, last but not least, Riko, a perverted and twisted girl. They are quite interesting counterparts and all of them have their interesting points... On a side note, Shirayuki is my favourite.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall plot is interesting, but gives me a feeling of being far too hurried up, and the ending gave me a feeling that a new season is yet to come, otherwise, this anime leaves many questions in the air, the excess of special powers here and there seems to be a bit too much, I wonder if there should be so much variety for such a short anime. But, all that aside, the anime offers lots of fanservice and many comical scenes too, that gives a good atmosphere between the action packed fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really feel obliged to compliment, though, is the sound. The music is great and is applied on just the right moments, it fits on the atmosphere swiftly and the participation of May'n is really something else. But, I can't rate it a 10, because I still have this weird feeling that something is off, it is a slight, subtle feeling, but still relevant.\\n\\n\r\nOn a final note, the art is very good, I admire the style of the author not only for the characters, but the ambient and guns. Nozaki-san deserves a pat in the shoulder.\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review, I hope it was useful and I am sorry that it turned out to be so long. I appreciate your interest in reading it, domo arigatou gozaimashita.",

I continued reading and watching the anime/manga but then it came the part whenthey reveal that Aria is from the family Holmes and Riku from Lupin, I just started to think WTF is that for? Including fiction characters on the anime just because they didn't had imagination to think in something better. But it just came worst with the familiar from a historical heroine Joan Of Arc.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that I continued to watch and reading the anime and manga, thinking that probably there would be more story or the story could improve with the time.\\n\\n\r\nBut then the final part on the anime appeared an I just became stupefied with the fact that Vlad was the Dracula and became a giant Wolf. WTF is that?\\n\\n\r\nThe fight against Vlad just happened too fast, they could actually put an effort for an awesome fight during 2episodes at least. Vlad 4th Weak Point was just to easy to find.\\n\\n\r\nThen I dropped the manga, because the anime was a FAIL and I thought \"Until now the manga is following the same story of the anime, probably if I read it will be the same thing and the same deception\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo that why I am giving Hidan no Aria a 3.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3- I think it was poor;\\n\r\nArt-7 I think the Art was the best thing on the anime, the rest was really poor;\\n\r\nSound- 6 I actually hated the opening, but the rest of the sound were fine;\\n\r\nCharacter-3  The fact of being character related to fiction character or historical heroines was bad. Kinji \"pervert mode\" I think it's Ok, but the fact of every girl is after him is just to conventional;\\n\r\nEnjoyment-3 I laugh a few times but it wasn't the anime that amazed me or gave me chills;\\n\\n\r\nHope that helps you and sorry if it has some errors.\\n",

One thing they had in common; namely that there is a younger girl and an older boy (at least in my opinion..), but that is that. \r\nI enjoyed the show, mostly because of the relation between the two main characters.\r\nThe relation also develops and deepens over time, which I find probabel. They get their assignments but a lot of other, unexpected things happens. Those things make the pair go to a higherlevel and that is also nice to see, in my opinion.",

(remember that is in my opinion),but also, they do little disrespect those families mentioned in the story, i may be Dominican, but i don't like anything that has to do with disrespecting, so i will give it a 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art: it wasn't a perfect, nor bad, it was... fair, i will give it a 6 too\\n\\n\r\nThe sound: hmmmm, just like the art, I found it fair enough, the OP and ending songs are just average, i will give it 6\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This little girl aria is like a pest and kinji just wants a normal life, i find it a little funny because normally, people like the idea of having their life changed by a flying girl, this guy just don't give a F*** :p i will give it a 7\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed it actually, it was pretty fun, but the \"making holes\" and \"that doesn't concern you\" were getting old... very fast, so i found myself a lot of times always predicting exactly what they were gonna say... i took some points for that, anyways, i will give it an 8\\n\\n\r\nif i had to give this anime like a number to rate it in an overall way i- wait... i have to do it, trololololol :p, (jk)\\n\r\nI would give this anime a 7/10 :D\\n\\n\r\nPD: i only have 15 years old so if you don't like this review, just forget about it :P, and... sorry for my bad english :P, thumbs up for dominicans :D",

Additionally there are some explosions, action scenes and kind of a red line(very thin). As I mentioned; after a hard day's work, you will enjoy it.

Even though the theme song is mostly about Aria the story basically revolves more around Kinji who is just trying to live his life at a Butei High School. The series was funny at times but sometimes got to be downright annoying. The plot basically changes so fast I almost couldn\u2019t keep up. This is one of those echiis where almost all the girls are in love with the same guy but the difference is these girls might end up KILLING EACHODERin the fight for his heart. I personally though the ending was a shoker so did not expect it (and I am rather good at guessing whose the bad guy in anime\u2019s)so If you like watching hot girls with short skirts kicking ass you should watch this.",

            "content": "- Hello guys, I finally bring you my review of Hidan on Aria, starting with the story, which does not stand out much, is not very different from other anime stories of this style; the story can even deliver some very interesting moments, but still has some very exaggerated moments of action and unfortunately this bothers, but otherwise is a good story.\r\n- On the technical side, unfortunately this is the weakest point of Hidan in Aria, the technical part is very weak as a whole, both the animation and mainly the visual are very weak, however what really bother is the CG used in somescenes of action, the GC is simply horrible and unfortunately it bothers a lot; already the direction is very good, mainly in the moments of comedy, it manages to deliver very amusing scenes, already in the scenes of action the direction sins a little, with exception of the last episode, that is simply excellent.\\n\\n\r\n- Now about the soundtrack, which is a very difficult point to explain because the soundtrack varies a lot, in some episodes the soundtrack and sound effects do very well, already in other episodes do not stand out much, anyway, varies a lot, but frankly the soundtrack could have been better used in some episodes, to help give more impact in some scenes, especially in the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\n- The characters Kinji Tooyama and Aria H. Kanzaki are simply excellent, they are very charismatic characters and very developed throughout the series, an excellent pairing of protagonists, in short, the cast as a whole is good too, but without a doubt the highlight goes to the protagonists.\\n\\n\r\n- Conclusion, Hidan no Aria unfortunately has a very weak technical part, a misused soundtrack and a dubious direction, but still it is an anime that I loved precisely because of the protagonists who are extremely charismatic, as well as providing very funny comedy moments ; Summing up, Hidan no Aria is a lot like a slice of life anime / comedy / drama, as an action anime he is very mediocre, so I only recommend it to anyone looking for a comedy / slice of life anime with extremely charismatic protagonists and catchy \ud83c\udf3a\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc90 !!\\n\\n\r\n- My Favorite Song by Hidan no Aria \ud83c\udf38: www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtmRdZWBll0\\n\\n\r\n- My Page About Animes on Facebook \ud83d\udc96: www.facebook.com/pg/AnimeSpaceBR.050/posts/?ref=page_internal\\n\\n\r\n\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude09\ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\ude0d\ud83c\udf3a !!",

            "content": "The story takes place in Tokyo Butei High School, a special school where armed detectives, known as Butei, are trained to use weapons. Kinji Tooyama is a second-year-student who wants a peaceful life but his special ability that makes him stand out makes it difficult to do so. However, when he gets caught in a bombing on the way to school, he encounters Aria Kanzaki, the most powerful S-Rank Butei student in Assault Studies.\r\nCaptivated by his amazing skills, Aria sets out to make Kinji her partner. Can a guy who desires peace ever team up with this loli tsundere S-ranked Butei student?\r\nHere\u2019s something truly amazingabout this anime. It\u2019s an Action anime with some Romance, Ecchi and Harem. It has Supernatural elements in it. It has terrorism as a base premise, a bit of historical elements and some good old fashion mild nudity. There is so much in this anime that it manages to balance all of these important aspects. It\u2019s truly an outstanding anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a JC Staff anime and that studio knows how to properly balance elements to make an anime shine. If you\u2019ve ever watched some of its previous works like Shakugan No Shana or Toaru majutsu no Index then you\u2019ll love Hidan no Aria. Those two shows also have action, romance, ecchi and a hint of harem. You can trust JC Staff to deliver another awesome show like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters where nicely done as well. The other girls, who sadly fall on the clich\u00e9d, are interesting on their own. Even though we have probably seen their type done to death in other anime, they still make the story more solid and more fun to watch. The interaction between the characters is nicely done and I believe this is the time to thank the seiyuus for that. There are some minor characters in the anime that appears seldom but even they have a great personality. It\u2019s great even though, yes, we have all seen it before.\\n\r\nThe action sequences are also nicely done. It\u2019s not the best you\u2019ll ever see and there is actually more talking than biting in the action parts. There is still character development during these fights so the fighting is not that prominent though the conclusions of the fights are very fun to watch. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the action sequences despite its lack of actual action. There is enough to further enhance the story and make the characters shine.\\n\r\nJC Staff is never lazy with the animation. The fight scenes are nicely animated and completely thought out. The anime uses some CGI elements like in the guns and bullets, the light rails and some of the vehicles in the first arc. I\u2019m never a fan of CGI but it make the anime look more \u201ccooler\u201d, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design isn\u2019t new. If you have seen Shana and Index then you have basically seen all the characters in Hidan no Aria. In a way, it helps the viewer familiarize with the anime but at the same time, you do wish the change it up a bit. I guess if it\u2019s not broken then don\u2019t fix it, right?\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED soundtrack was not that great in my opinion. I does not really stand out and sounds like your typical opening and ending song. It does not jump out and grab you like some great songs does. The songs were overshadowed by everything else in the anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Im guessing the first thing that captures most people when choosing an anime to watch is how captivating the synopsis is, and how 'cool' the characters look, however i don't think this approach is working for me.\r\nStory: 4 - Hidan no Aria boasts a premise which feels like something borrowed from many different shows, however as high school animes seem to be so popular i can't fault them for going with it. A school where the students named Butei are taught to become merceneries and always carry a handgun feels like an interesting storyline, however it all just doesnt come together and leaves you wantingsomething more. What annoyed me is how irrelavant a lot of things are, i mean even the name doesn't make sense ' Aria the Scarlet Ammo', i mean it just sounds like a bunch of words that could describe the anime were put into a box and a child just picked them out whilst not being too bothered about the order either. The story is there is no story, every episode just seems like a mini fight between the main characters over the love or just sexual presence of the protoganist who's name i can't even be bothered to write because he was irrelevant as well. He is portrayed to be a weakling who can only become some amazingly super smart and cool protective person when he enters 'Hysteria Mode' and this can only be set off by him being sexually aroused of all things. Now i could just go with it if they at least explained how this had occured and where this ability had come from, however like many things in the series it was just left unanswered, like what is the fate of his brother who apparently died on a ship, and why is he letting someone stroll around with him like they are best friends, someone who might know his brothers.whereabouts and not even bother asking. He just seemed really drab the entire time and would come alive for maybe 30 seconds when he was in hysteria mode. Also 'IU' the supposed criminal organisation that have been trying to kill 'Butei', no information whatsoever is given about them or what they stand for or their goals, however their female operatives seem to share a similar trait of ditching the organisation and being best friends with the protagonist who they were trying to kill.\\n\\n\r\nSound + Art: 8 - I guess the art style is one of the shows saving graces, it looked fresh and the art work on the characters and there weapons looked pretty amazing if im honest however other then that not much stood out. The opening was pretty catchy, i did find myself skipping the ending however but that is just my personal taste. The voice actors all seemed placed rightfully according to their character type, Rie Kugimiya as Aria did a great job as the tsundere type that she is well known for and she is one of the reasons i wanted to keep watching, however i did think i was watching Toradora at moments (one of my fav animes) not only due to how many times she said idiot but how similar the characters looked, and their hate of big breasts haha.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5 - The characters just didn't really stand out to me, and that doesn't mean they were not fun or enjoyable but they just all fit into character types that i have seen many many times before, but what i like about Hidan no Aria is that it knows this and doesn't shy away from it, which results in some pretty funny and random moments. The main male Kinji Tooyama is the quiet, bored, dissaproving of his lifestyle kind of guy, even though he for some reason finds himself with three different girls all after him, and to be honest even though the creators are trying to push him to Aria, i still didn't see any affirmation of his feelings to her in particular other then he gets turned on faster seeing her naked then other girls, and if this is what passes for love nowadays then i am seriously behind. Aria is the typical hot headed Tsundere however with her the rage just seems over the top, and i can't put this fault only on her as the other characters such as Shirayuki also suffer from this, this annoying random urge to kill any female that Kinji is speaking to, now maybe because guns are natural in their school setting i shouldn't really care but i expected a bit more emotion and opening up (from the heart) instead it was replaced with who can unbutton their top the fastest. So yeah i would have preffered some more emotional scenes espicially if they were going to put a group of girls after him like that, some people say its a harem, some say its not and i can see both reasons why, all i know is you won't find any of your hopes fufilled. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5 - Do i feel like i've wasted hours of my life, honestly yes. Did i enjoy some parts of it, also yes. Would i recommend you to watch it, hells no. There are so many other things you could do then keep asking yourself questions that are never going to be answered whilst watching this. Its like a tease, when you think its going good and you were right to keep watching it will name the characters after fictional people such as Holmes and Lupin and Dracula, some of which i don't even think were in the same time period. This names were also something that were not given an explanation and i still to this day don't know why they were included. I don't hate this anime, but its not one i would recommend to my friends, espicially any of those who are starting out and don't want to be put off for life. Wow, so that's my first review done. I hope i didn't nag too much but some things just needed to be said.",

            "content": "Hidan no Aria is an action/harem about a guy with a split personality in a high school meant to train mercenaries that are for some reason called detectives. The series is hard to judge as on one end (character development) it sticks strictly to the books while on another end (plot/setting) it is so radically implausible that it is hilarious.\r\nI found the series fairly average though your mileage will vary. There's some decent action sequences and a bit of ecchi. The harem aspect isn't too terribly strong and the plot continuity breaks apart towards the end of the series. If girls and guns (or RieKugimiya) is your thing, then I'd try a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation is Aria is fairly good. I like the color scheme and the gun fight animation sequences, and the character designs are cute. There are definitely ecchi sequences including some white fog though some if it is more intentional rather than accidental (Riko *cough*). The series can be summed up as fruit salad including a bunch of guns and explosions and lots of girls on top of the main lead.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI really dislike the singer in the OP, which totally ruins the otherwise somewhat dark yet fast-paced song. The ED is a rock piece with a decent main melody but a bit too slow-paced. The BGM is fair and consists of a wide variety of instrumental guitars and a few electronic pieces.\\n\\n\r\nAs for VAs, we find Rie Kugimiya in her typical short-girl with a tsundere personality. Special props to Mariya Ise for her role as Riko with her combination of cuteness and sexual suggestiveness. Perhaps one reason why I'm willing to add the sequel to my watchlist.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThis is where the review gets tricky... this series in innovative in how it puts a whole bunch of radical ideas together, yet utterly plain in adopting tsundere behaviors and following harem traditions. It does a good job introducing the wacky setting but like many other series ends up losing its way near the end of the series; a good comparison can be made at this point to Date a Live. In both shows, the ending is a bit overboard and early antagonists eventually are adopted as supporting assistants.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall plot takes an arc-based approach with each arc culminating in a showdown with an antagonist. These arcs build on each other and the show ends with a hilarious battle that doesn't really resolve much, hence the sequel.\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely one series that was probably better in its novel form as there are lots of teasers and references that will not make sense unless you read the novels or you wikipedia all the details. Not to mention a lot of plot holes and unanswered questions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs with the story section, you have a lot of strange characters. The school has lots of students that are apparently descendants of well known figures such as Sherlock Holmes and thus they \"inherit\" special/supernatural abilities. Our main character, for instance, has an ability to go into \"cool-guy\" mode when he is aroused by women, a mode in which he somehow turns into 007 and becomes ridiculously good at shooting/charming/thinking/lock picking, etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is fairly muted, as more of the focus is on just character interactions, i.e. an increasing number of girls fighting over our main lead. These interactions are fairly humorous as it often involves cat fights with guns/swords but otherwise follow a typical harem progression.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nDespite the series using a bunch of cliches and some other strange elements, this was a decent watch, if just to laugh at the hilarity of it all. Rie Kugimiya does her typical job and you even get a few nice action sequences.Riko is definitely what you'll remember and probably enjoy the most in this show; not quite a Yuno Gasai, but memorable nonetheless.",

With his 'ability' (keeping it vague to not spoil it) he can easily accomplish many things but he hates it and how it activates that is what you have to admit and say sucks. Though some people would love it as well.\r\nThe female protagonist has issues with connecting with people which can also be understood. \"The strong are alone\" though i cant rememberwhere i heard this it really comes to mind when watching this anime and seeing her relationship with her fellow butei.\\n\\n\r\nYou can really connect with the main 2 characters and with other characters it adds a funny flare to it as well it also allows more interesting things to happen. \\n\r\nNo one wants something where the same people do the same thing over and over again. Thats why this anime is so good you only have the male and female protagonist in each 'mission' that way the 3rd character is someone different which allows a person to keep interested it whats going on.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to people who like lots of action with surprisingly lots of comedy mixed in. \\n\\n\r\nSometimes you just have to feel sorry for the male protagonist but on other occasions you just want to be in the same boots too.",

Its true that those people who read the novel may be little disappointed since this adaptation changes and leaves out many great parts and details, but its still great.\r\nStory: I think that the story is well done. Its about a High School for Butei but i will skip the summary since everyone knows it already. What i like is that it takes known characters like Lupin, Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, Cleopatra and others and makes a good story out of it.It has known items like Durandal and Ragnarock and others too.I like supernatural stuff and i like how they implemented that element here and it fits the story well. Its unique. I dont want to spoil anything so i will just leave it at the general stuff but you just cant go wrong when its about girls with guns, detectives and high school and lots of action. Comedy is great too.\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are great aswell, most of you already know but the 2 main chars are voice by Rie and Junji which as a pair was also seen in Toradora. That was good shit and its nice to see them here aswell. Im a fan of Kugimiya Rie, always like her tsundere loli characters(Shana is mai favu of all). So yea they did a great job, i mean its hard to resist a tsundere loli with twintails, pink hair and guns thats voiced by Rie.\\n\r\nArt & Sound: That is normal as you would expect from a modern anime, its great but nothing too special.\\n\\n\r\n*I really recommend the light novel for those who did not read it yet, its lot better than the anime and manga. I gave this a 10 but the novel goes above that in terms of ranking and is really worth it. The story gets really good in the later parts, hope to see them in a second season. We learn more about EU and how Aria got the name of \"Scarlet Ammo\" and lots of other good stuff.",

            "content": "Did you ever wonder why if an anime does not include a trip to hot springs or a beach, then there is a scene in a bath in it? Why the best protection for a female fighter is provided by an outfit that disrupts the enemy thinking with the necessity to appreciate some naked skin? Why it is so necessary to make it clear that a heroine speaks while having her panties on? I guess the goals of all that and Hidan no Aria are the same. \r\nThis anime passes some tests for greatness. Do I want to skip the opening or the ending songafter hearing that 10+ times? No. Do I wonder how 20+ minutes of an episode could pass by unnoticed? Yes. Have I remembered a moment from this anime all of a sudden next day? Yes. Is viewing of any episode a reliable way to change the weather? Yes, absolutely.\\n\\n\r\nCan I expect everyone to share that with me? Well... there is a precondition. \\n\\n\r\nHidan no Aria may look like a high school story, or mystery, or fighting, or harem, or tsundare act, or comedy, or drama. I may, if you believe it is. The precondition is that you do not.\\n\\n\r\nIf you do, it will turn out to be a mediocre or even bad anything, from a harem to a fighting. Technical perfection going nowhere. If you do not, just relax and enjoy the show, the same technical perfection is worth it. This way the anime can stand on its own.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it should not. Hidan no Aria quotes, resembles, links to lots of other anime, from Claymore to Sizumiya, from Daphne in the Brilliant Blue to Shana, from Elfen Lied to Freezing. And all that appears to be some quite serious anime. Something that, when taken really seriously, may be painful to see. Aria, not being serious at all, takes that pain away.\\n\\n\r\nIt clears that which all the hot springs and panties have left behind. It makes the show lighter and easier. You do not need to pretend you do not see some things any more. The scenes in a bath are more efficient from this moment on.\\n\\n\r\nFor that purpose, it is enough to see Aria once. I will see it again, but this is optional. Maybe that is why DVDs are not selling well enough and there may be no second season.I would miss it, but Aria has already done its job well and we can leave without the next one for a while, say for another 10 years.",

            "content": "This would be my review of Hidan no aria (obviously) and for not being that known it's a great anime, i'll start with the story\r\nI gave it a 9 since i am rating the ANIME and the story of it doesn't nearly cover the Light novels. What little bit we got is borderline amazing, however it doesn't contain much of plot twists or just plain content of epic scale. And to be honest, it is a little bit to spread to have the potential in a near future. I would very much like to see more of this show and the idea surrounding the Malelead's power is top notch and is totally original, and i would really like some development of it's role in the main characters relationship.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is the art. not an astonishing feat but. It's nice and i like it, however when rating art one should really keep in mind that its to some extent held back by the setting/s of the show and since this is set in (mostly) a \"normal\" city with none whatsoever geographically special futures. Shadowing/lightning  does magic and considering the budget such a show would get i think they did exactly what they should have done and delivered the best they could\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the sound, i didn't give much thought about whilst watching the show more than the framed soundtracks (like i do with most shows) and i spot no error. the seiyuus are nice and i'm a big Rie fan and there's no faulty synch(there never are... tsch...) overall i find it a little bit hard to rate sound in detective shows where the audience is intrigued in analyzing the plot and all the focus on the background is removed (this is true for other genres aswell)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are good, and the Male lead is almost genius! His power is so damn original to (atleast non-h shows) that i was almost knocked out when i realized what it actually was. His backstory doesn't have any filthy spots and you can't expect angel beats from every show (competing with drama is hard as it is) and i enjoyed watching him create dialogue and act for further dialogue material. The female lead is fairly speaking ( I love tsundere but i'll try to contain myself for a rational review) OK, she has a special lineage. Not that unusual for making character, or story for that matter. she act accordingly to the traits given to her and doesn't confuse the viewers and care them away since being comprehensive is a arguable subject when making characters and different parameters exist regarding the genre whilst being original is a diceroll way to sell a show there's a fine line where you lose noticeable merit. \\n\\n\r\nI would absolutely recommend the show to anyone reading this review since you are probably interested in genre or a character trait involved, which is what makes any show enjoyable",

With a story like that, it shouldn't be taken too seriously. That's probably why I got such great enjoyment out of the entire show. It did stray a bit from the original premise of a mercenary high school towards the end, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment.\r\nThe other thingthat was interesting was that Aria was able to pull off a pianoish battle theme, which was really cool. And overall, the OST stood out to me as quite good.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a fan of chibish girls like Aria, but I was willing to put up with it for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nYou also have your usual assortment of character tropes, but I also expected that, and I don't think they abused them to the point where it became annoying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think it was my enjoyment factor that really made me want to keep watching, not one particular trait of the anime.",

For those who likes to watch an anime for the sake of nice art feel free to watch. Have a nice day n pls do not bash on me for being bias, thanks for reading.",

If your looking for an anime that combines cute girls, guns, explosions, and a fair amount of comedy then this is the anime for you! The only part I didn't necessarily like about this anime was the story line. It wasn't that the story line wasn't good enough, but instead that it seemed to end way to quickly. I've watched in Sub and Dub, so i can say that both versions are worth it to watch! If your not hooked by the end ofthe first episode then i advise you give the second a try, because the second episode is what really got me interested! I hope you plan to watch it and enjoy it!",

Fantastic story and a amazing art style for it's time, it was one the only anime that I was really addicted to. I also loved the sound of bullets whizzing by and how well the action scenes were animated. I think the characters were like the icing on top of the cake, I like to love relations they had and loved Kinji's hysteria mode he looks and sounds badass. I hope would enjoy it!!!",

            "content": "Now before I get into what I thought of this series, let me first say that I am a big fan of the original light novel, and I was really looking forward to its adaptation. Usually JC Staff does a great job with the light novel adapatations of Shana, Index, and Zero no Tsukaima, so I wasn't really worried. Unfortunately, saying that they dropped the ball on this series is a gross understatement. Don't get me wrong, the series is probably fine by itself if you've never read the original work, but since I had, it left a lot to be desired for me. Momentsthat were once moving, emotional, and suitably epic are in most cases reduced to coming off as cheesy and ridiculous. Since there is almost no introspection from Kinji, many of the events that were so cool in the novel end up looking like complete bullshit and arbitrary deus ex machina. It's still a fun watch, but you've been warned--don't take it seriously. One thing I will say, all the girls are deliciously cute. Recommended for fans of Zero no Tsukaima, Shana, Toradora, Astarotte no Omocha, and any other show where Kugimiya Rie voices a loli.",

            "content": "Alright, this anime started out well enough, it seemed to hurt itself over time. I found myself watching the first episode and becoming hooked to its action scenes, especially with the remote control scooter things with Uzis bolted to them. After that everything seemed to go downhill, with enemies rushed through and scenes pushed to late to be of use to the character or even the viewer. However, we're here for a review, so lets begin.\r\nStory: 5\r\nWith what little story I could gather from its mangled body of plot holes and misinformation, I have formed that the main character and the other people within theanime are special in that they can shoot guns, solve crimes, and be good at it , however they are in training. Their official designation are \"Butei\" and the main character is a special one at that. He has a condition called \"Hysteria Mode\" which gives him the superhuman ability to be deadly accurate, skilled with blades, as well as having a split personality. The story surprisingly starts of well, but plummets all the way to the end. Even the end season boss was lackluster and unsurprising. It was easily forgettable in my eyes anyway.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThis is one if the reasons  I didn't quit, with many of the scenes being well drawn and the characters looking delightful and well rounded, with many characteristics drawn nicely, and the scenery is charming to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nAnother reason I didn't give up. Many of the characters voices fit well with themselves, especially Aria's bitchy, bratty, but accurate age voice. The songs are not to shabby and are worth a couple of minutes of listening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7 \\n\r\nTo be fair, the characters within the anime are done nicely, but do not stick out much from the framework of stereotypical characters within anime. Few seem to be unique in that they can do something someone can't, but in basic characteristics, seem to be awkward at best. Aria, for example, is introduced as the main heroine of the show next to Kinji, being a loli, she feels somewhat inferior to other woman when it comes to feminine characteristics, and constantly makes scathing remarks toward more endowed women. This is overdone to say the least, but Aria should be more professional in my opinion due to her rank and other reasons that by far outweigh the size of one's tits....\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nI often found myself getting distracted while watching this anime due to how scarcely interested I was during episodes 2-12, but the beginning was the best part , so I kept watching in hope of some similar action, but to no avail. I enjoyed small bits of it from time to time and did crack a few smiles whenever Kinji spoke about his life or experiences\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not the worse I have seen, but it's nowhere good, just average. I will not deter you from watching this anime, but be warned, only watch this if you have nothing better to do or watch.",

            "content": "*first review on MAL* *warning some spoilers for future light novel events as well as anime events* *apologies in advance if I get stuff wrong my memory of the series is hazy and I might recall events wrong please msg me if I do so I may correct it*\r\nOkay first off I have to mention that a lot of the reviews don't bring up the light novels, as suck this review will be more of a comparison of the two for why it fails even more. After reading the novels and comparing to the anime I must say the anime is completely watered down. Whilethey get the jist of things it seems like Kinji's internal snarking has been replaced by full out violent gunfights, which sucks because his snarking is one of the better things about the series. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to mention is I am a younger generation of anime viewer so the book of cliche's isnt quite set in yet, and I am not nearly as cynical as other people here. I'm a simple guy, fairly easy to please and I think for people watching it with my mindset it's mediocre at best terrible if you've read the light novels. \\n\\n\r\nThe Harem Angle is played up a bit too much now and small moments where Kinji just gives his two cents on Butei life is replaced by random wacky hijinks to give his haremettes more screentime. Because of this characters get flanderized into into stock static archetypes the mainstream knows and the characterization suffers. Most people, exasperated with the tsundere trope no doubt, will wonder \"why the hell does Kinji but up with this brat\".\\n\\n\r\n Now if the characterization was done properly we would get glimpses into Kinji's past life, the whole with his brother and how he got alienated with the butei lifestyle. After learning that Aria has had a bad relationship with her main family and ESPECIALLY after meeting her mother we learn that Kinji feels a strange sense of kinship. She's trying to live up to expectations and trying to be like her idol, Sherlock Holmes. Once again if the studio bothered to actually TRY and get characterization across we'll learn that Kinji used to idolize his older brother and was kinda like Aria in that respect explaining why he sticks with her.\\n\\n\r\nShirayuki from this version is just flat out crazy. Her past as a \"caged bird\" is barely touched upon making it seem like a half assed explaination for WHY she's a psycho yandere. The LNs have an entire festival scene where she and kinji just hang out, act like friends, and talk about her past. It's more or less stated she has near no contact with men outside of Kinji and his brother so to her him taking punishment to get her outside to a festival, so she could experience just a little bit of normal life outside of being a miko was probably the biggest act of love and kindness she's ever recieved. In the anime this borders on being a throwaway explaination Kinji gives. Also don't remember if this happened in the anime or not but Reki helps lead Kinji to where durandal is. (please msg with corrections if it did).\\n\\n\r\nRiko, this one is a toughie cause I can't read her character as well. However there were more \"practice\" scenes for the manor infiltration and she NEVER talked about abandonign Aria in the novels. Overall she ended being more childish, more perverted, and more selfish than in the light novels, just liek everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nThe clunky writing also throws out any kind of foreshadowing the novels had.\\n\\n\r\nHey ya know that green haired girl Reki who just sort of appeared on a helicopter there were more scenes with her. Like a scene where Kinji asks what the hell is up with her headset. It's actually foreshadowing for a future arc when she sorta holds him hostage while also claiming that their lovers (it's complicated just read the LNs if you actually want to know) Minor complaints here since she doesnt get any kind of actual role yet.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, what the hell was up with Kana? If you only watched the anime fuck would you know about it. This one was probably a decision to avoid cliffhangers that may never be expanded on but it still hurts the series because now if it ever does get a second season (doubtful) since it will likely be poorly explained. This is expanded upon in the novels where his reactions hint at Kana having died.\\n\\n\r\nFor an actual review of the anime, overall this series has a fairly interesting premise. It's enjoyable for mainstream viewers with lower expectations who can deal with the stock characters. However if you've read the light novels you might find the adaptation to be somewhat frustrating because it replaced small character moments and foreshadowing for more action and dumb harem sketches. Characterization falls completely flat and you'll be wondering why the HELL did they decide to skimp out on moments that flesh out the characters a bit more and give insight into why they act the way they do. Motivations are relegated to throwaway explainations and dramatic moments get shooed away for more harem comedy. If you see this series as just an anime and can lower your expectations to deal with this cliched series than it's a decent time waster. For people who actually like the premise and want to know about the characters and the world go read the light novels, they actually have some sort of substance beyond the harem route.\\n",

            "content": "If you can accept that high schoolers can legally run around with guns and katanas and do police work, you will find that the rest of the universe becomes rather plausible. However the mechanics sadly lack consistency. The show tends to treat Hysteria mode as a deus ex machina kind of feature. Most problems faced by the protagonist are solved through the power of his boner, which comes across as a hindrace for the character developement. This is especially true in his interactions with female characters. More often than not, conflicts and disagreements are solved by him going into HSS and the women melting awaylike wax in his hands. One can consider this as a integral part of the story but I did not come around feeling, that this often does not give the female characters the credit they deserve.\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist has a trait called \"Hysteria Savant Syndrome\", which enables him to call upon enhanced strength, stamina and cognitive and coordinative abilities. It is activated by sexual arousal (of course) and thus a convenient in-universe explanation for the ridiculous amount of fanservice in this show. It enables him e.g. to avoid bullets and retaliate with extreme precision. The protagonist himself does not like the ability, because under its influence he becomes irresistible and behaves like Casanova, for which he is ashamed afterwards. As a consequence he is a loner that avoids women but by the law of Harem-Anime is inevitably swarmed by a estrogen tsunami of female characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are generally very stereotypical. The protagonists Harem consists of a loli tsundere, a childhood friend yandere, a villanous tease and many more. In the light novels we also find a mysterious kuudere, a sister, a trap, a dandere, a furry, an actual guy (hinted) and several older women. Mostly if you know the main clich\u00e9 they play into there is almost nothing further to know. The yandere character will ALWAYS behave like a yandere under all circumstances and without exception. This soon renders the interactions calculable and hardly surprising, but if you like two girls catfighting over a guy with swords and pistols over and over again...\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is not really an exception, so we are stuck with the usual dense, broody loser/loner type Harem-Protagonist. What sets him apart at least partially is his deeply cynical attitude. The one job that he does not want to do is that of a butei. The one job he happens to be actually good at is that of a butei. He is roped into the entire story by the female tsundere lead and constantly complains about the chaos happening around him. His snarkiness comes across mostly in the light novels and not at all in the anime. He acts very little on his own accord and is mostly dragged along by the other characters. This is somewhat justified as his role is that of Arias partner.\\n\\n\r\nThe singular one most annyoing part of the show is by FAR the leading heroine: Aria Kanzaki. She is a childish, prideful and stubborn patchwork of all complexes known to mankind. She is as loud and abrasive as her behaviour is irritating. I do not generally dislike maniacs in leading roles, as long as they are interesting to some degree. Unfortunately in the same way as all characters Arias' behaviour is constrained to her tsundere role, so I couldn't help myself cracking a hearty smile when she got slapped.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion the characters are mostly nothing special and fit a typical harem-anime. If you aren't tired yet of seeing the same clich\u00e9s reiterated you could give it a shot.\\n\\n\r\nThe humour is mostly based on the stereotypical behaviour of the cast and/or physical humour. If we were given a cent everytime the tsundere threatens to shoot people because she was embarassed, we'd be rich by the end. Of the first episode.\\n\r\nThe humour is one among many things that puts a stretch on the credibility of the universe. Two girls fighting and shooting at each other within a student dorm room and completely wrecking it in the process is somehow not punished at all. Opening fire at the protagonist in public because YOU drank from HIS cola is of course completely rational human behaviour. I am more than willing to suspend my disbelief for a good joke, but it really went overboard at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice belongs to the most annoying and reoccuring elements of the show. This kind of fanservice is the reason I lock the door when watching anime, despite the fact that I live alone. There are probably not many Rom-Com clich\u00e9s the writers didn't pull here, from convenient falling, intruding the bathroom to accidentally discovering undergarments and indirect kisses (i.e. Drinking from another's drink) we must suffer through everything. A lot of the fanservice was mostly a cheap, awkward filler, and sometimes very uncalled for. Nonetheless there are scenes that, despite the shame- ,need-, use- and tasteless display of half-naked girls, actually contain story or (behold!) even character developement.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a standard redemption plot, where the titular heroine tries to bail her falsely accused mother out prison. By the laws of her origin she needs to find a partner, which she believes to have found in the protagonist. The protagonist is soon recruited (by force) as her \"slave\" and dragged along various missions.\\n\\n\r\nAlbeit predictable at times the story is surely interesting enough to keep watching, even though it becomes more and more absurd as the show continues. One might even continue just to see what kind of bullshit the author is pulling out of his ass next. (It's not better in the light novel. Rule Nr.1: As soon as magic enters, things go south.)\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem with this show is, that the author is constantly sabotaging himself. There is so much potential buried in there, that is sacrificed to useless fanservice, stupid comedy and generic writing. The protagonists Hysteria Mode serves as an example. His main trigger for Hysteria mode (read: sexual arousal) is his partner Aria, who is underdeveloped in both body and mindset. If you consider, that the protagonist does not like \"what he does\" when under the influence of HSS, you could interpret this as him being a self-aware sexual predator and pedophile. This is a topic the story never deals with. Additionally there is so much more that could be made of the characters in this show. Instead of acting by themselves they fall into their stereotypical roles again and again, displaying the same kind of behaviour without any kind of developement. The problem is that I sometimes had the impression, that there was more to the characters, their actions, motives and intentions. It seemed as if they had a hidden depth, that the author would shy away to openly show.\\n\\n\r\nRiko Mine is a good example. One finds out that she is a very traumatized woman, that constructs her aggressively sexual personality as means to cope and survive. BUT this is just briefly mentioned and then never again, shoving her back into her role as the villanous tease. This constant self-sabotaging is just sad and discouraging to watch. I am not even sure if the author noticed the possibilities he created. Which is at least preferable to believing he willingly threw them away...",
