            "content": "First and foremost, I went into Chaika without greatly high expectation as I hadn't heard too much about it, it was one of the least hyped shows airing at the moment.\r\nAnd it turns out that it was also one of the most underrated!\r\nSo let's begin...\r\nStory - 9/10.\r\nThe story of this anime may not look particularly original if you only read the synopsis, but getting into it it provides a really satisfying adventure-filled romp through various places. I didn't find the story either too simple or too complex, it was filled with just the right amount of twists and turns and didn't overcomplicate itself with overlywordy explanations, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't pay it full attention, as it's full of little details. What also made this enjoyable to me was the lack of fanservice - a nice refreshing change from a lot of the anime currently airing (similar to WIXOSS), which I think would have detracted from the story. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10.\\n\r\nAlthough it may not be the \"standard\" anime style, I really enjoyed the art of Chaika. It was refreshing and original, and I thought it gave the characters actual character. It looked really nice in HD and the colours were fitting - dark and gloomy when the mood called for it, and lighter neutral tones when needed. I also enjoyed the fact that Frederica (sp?) was not animated in 3D - this can often look clunky and out of place in anime, so it was nice to see. The 3D animation that there was (the air ships, some of the magic effects) actually fit in nicely with the overall art style and did not detract from the anime at all. The fights were also really well animated - they didn't look ridiculous, or impossible, instead going for a more believable style.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10.\\n\r\nWhat I really liked about Chaika was not the sound, although a really good job was done with it. The opening theme, DARAKENA, is catchy and sets the mood for the anime quite well, and the background sounds within the anime were fitting - the mood was also set by little piano parts and punchier music. The characters' voices were excellent for their character - they could have made the mistake of making Chaika too \"moe\", and although her voice was pretty high pitched it never seemed to fall into that trap, at least not for me. It portrayed her apparent innocence very well. I also liked the fact that Akari's voice was a bit more mature sounding, as often in anime now even girls in their 20s sound like they are 5, which is frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10.\\n\r\nAnd here we come to my favourite part of Chaika. The cast of characters I thought was phenomenal - you have the two main characters, Toru and Akari, brother and sister but not by blood, Chaika, the coffin princess, Frederica the dragoon and a host of other side characters, each of which added something to the story. The interactions between the main characters are funny, sometimes adorable and always somewhat believable. Akari is obsessed with Toru, but it's a running gag that this show does not overuse so it doesn't come across as needy and annoying. And they both have an actual personality to support such gags, as opposed to them being essentially token characters. Chaika is a bit of a mystery - she seems innocent and pure, however throughout the story she is made to doubt herself and her purpose. I can't say much more without spoiling the story.\\n\r\nI found even the side characters had their place in Chaika, either adding another bit of comedy, seriousness and depth - the mysterious entity telling Chaika where to find remains, Gilette-sama and his band of followers and various other parties are met along the way and they all add a little something more to Chaika.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10.\\n\r\nOf course I very much enjoyed Chaika, I thought it was a fun, heartwarming and exciting experience. I fell in love with the characters very quickly, they're so well written and none of them seem out of place.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys a fun adventure story with bits of comedy and a lot of magic.",

            "content": "Every season there are a handful of shows that are overlooked and underrated. Hitsugi no Chaika takes this fact, and shoves it down peoples' throats by making itself even more underrated. Before the Spring 2014 season began, I had mediocre expectations of Chaika. But sooner than later, I found myself as one of the lucky ones to stay with it all the way through.\r\nStory: 8\r\nAt first glance the plot of Hitsugi no Chaika may seem \"dull\" or \"cliche\", but Chaika ultimately stands to deliver a fresh, new kind of plotline that is rather unprecedented in my opinion. It's not often you find adventure shows withthree characters traversing the Earth and having badass fights every episode. Personally, the story saves Chaika from mediocrity and adds a lot of originalty.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 7\\n\r\nOkay, yes, the art style of Chaika was probably the largest turn-off for most people. But all in all, the art actually complimented the show quite nicely. Although Studio Bones did choose an original style, overall it doesn't really compete with some older anime. The animation however was decent enough, and each fight scene was very engaging, especially considering how they fought. Another thing about the art that stood out were the 3D magic effects. On their own they looked nice, but together with the normal art made it seem out of place most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe sound/music of Chaika is arguably one of the highest points in the show. The voice actors for Toru and Akari fit their personalities and roles quite well. Chaika herself stands out the most...why? Well...Her actress did portray Chaika well enough, but at times her voice did make her a little annoying. Also the opening (DARAKENA) is an Excellent choice for the show's tone. Personally, I couldn't get through it each episode without replaying it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nThe three main characters: Chaika, Toru and Akari are definitely some of the most original characters I've seen in a while. Both Toru and Akari are perpetual badasses, and while they don't have much of an outstanding personality, they are still very likable. Now, Chaika is a cute character and all, but most of the time I found myself getting very annoyed with her character because she doesn't do much more than just sit back and act as the show's Damsel in Distress.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI think it goes without saying that this is very enjoyable show. Not necessarily a diamond in the rough, but definitely something that will keep your eyes peeled almost every minute.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nHitsugi no Chaika is definitely one of those shows that was massively overlooked during it's respective season. One thing, if any, is that Chaika does not fail to administer a dose of \"originality\" something that most anime seem to lack nowadays. Something as refreshing as Hitsugi no Chaika is meant for everybody, and should not be missed by anybody.",

            "content": "It\u2019s always difficult to review shows like Hitsugi no Chaika - ones that are clearly enjoyable to watch, but not necessarily of high quality. The characters are nice, though flat; the world is mysterious and intriguing, though it doesn't remain so; and the politics and ideologies are interesting, though simple. It\u2019s the type of show you might marathon some lonely weekend, enjoying as you watch it, and then completely forget about. \r\n       The show takes you through the adventures of Chaika Trabant, Toru Acura, and Akari Acura to recapture the remains of a deceased, tyrannical king - Emperor Gaz.The king was a \u201cbad guy\u201d who loved war, and thus the question throughout the series is whether war is a positive or negative good. Don\u2019t expect this to be investigated too much; this is not one of the better shows on the morality of war, like Now and Then, Here and There. But they do interesting things with the motif. Along with that, questions of identity begin to pop up, prominently for Chaika but also for others; the question of how we determine and relate our identities to what we think, or what history claims, us to be becomes a formative point for a variety of characters. \\n\\n\r\n      Many of the other reviews seem to praise the storyline - and I can see why. There is a sense of scope, of ambition, in the epic suggestions the story attempts to suggest. But to end a review at what the show attempts to do, and to forget how it actually turns out, does a disservice to readers. There are little interesting details, but Hitsugi no Chaika doesn\u2019t do this particularly well. There is a vague alliance of nations - the Six Nations - that serve as the constant backdrop to the adventures of our hero and heroines - they really only come into play when the show wants to show how badass the villain is, who will inevitably destroy their slow fleet. They might be vaguely based on European kingdoms. That \u201cbad\u201d king? He ruled for a long time, did bad stuff with magic. Never really elaborated. You will never truly be invested in the world Hitsugi no Chaika describes, because we\u2019re not really meant to be invested in it.\\n\\n\r\n\tRather, we\u2019re drawn to the characters. Toru Acura is a lazy bum of a saboteur, one bored dry by the armistice with the Gaz Empire drawn up fifteen years prior. His passion for fighting and the saboteur lifestyle has led him to become idle in the era of peace. Akari, his sister, is...well, into her brother. That\u2019s really her most important quality. The show plays up her fascination to outrageous, hilarious degrees. Chaika, with her adorably broken Engrish, grows and develops as a character during their adventures to retrieve Emperor Gaz\u2019 body parts. Soon others pop up too, but the focus remains on the core three - for awhile, at least. Again, don\u2019t expect too much here. The characters are nice, but nothing to write a paper on.\\n\\n\r\n      Peppered throughout are plenty of adequate action scenes - occasionally, they\u2019re even awesome, though only occasionally. The fights are distinguished by teamwork and cooperation, which give an exciting and tangible feel to an otherwise confusing battle system. For example: Toru and Akari - both hired by Chaika as saboteur bodyguards - heighten their powers via the Iron and Blood Transformation, an unexplained technique that, well, makes them more durable. Why? Because lineage, one supposes. The music is decent, nothing extraordinary. Decent art - nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\n      Clearly I\u2019m not enamored by the series - but I tuned in to watch it, and its sequel, every week. As long as you don\u2019t expect too much from the show, I recommend it to everyone - especially to those who love a series that hints at a large, almost epic scope. I don\u2019t think the series really keeps that hope alive for very long, as most of the promising things about the series fail to live up; they are, instead of becoming great, wholly adequate. \\n\\n\r\n     Chaika might be among the most adequate shows I\u2019ve ever seen - everything is fine, nothing is particularly great. I don\u2019t intend to pretend that this show is worth a particularly high rating - it simply is not relative to other anime series, and I think anime scores should be, in some fashion, relative to the quality of other anime. Don\u2019t let the numbers deter you, though - we all easily gravitate towards 10s and the like. Sometimes a light, lower score is still worth a watch - often, in fact. Chaika is an instance of a show that does everything alright - sometimes bad, sometimes good, but rarely great - and can entertain you without blowing you away.   \\n",

            "content": "At first glance, Hitsugi no Chaika (Coffin Princess Chaika) may be interpreted as a cheesy adventure. We get a trio of characters traveling on a sort of journey across the continent in a fantasy realm. And one of those characters is a young girl named Chaika with mysterious origins while carrying a coffin almost twice her size. As peculiar as all this sounds, the show has an alluring premise filled with mysteries and charming moments. From these moments also draws forward an ability to make the audience follow its story. And trust me, it\u2019s worth every single minute.\r\nFirst thoughts coming into this show is adaptation.After all, the show is based off of a light novel of the same name. The show isn\u2019t unique or a solitary premise considering the idea of traveling and adventure. But what rains this show with wonders is the progress as an adventure to capture and deliver its message. Communicating that message takes effort but thankfully, this show aces through that with its story, characters, and abstractions. What the show offers is a bit more than just an odyssey but story value and integrity.\\n\\n\r\nThe journey our characters are part of takes place in a fantasy world where a past war resulted in various circumstances. In retrospect, the show identifies itself with its premise and follows it through with clever usage of historical events. These include the 200-year war that ended 5 years ago as well as the death of Emperor Arthur Gaz, a prominent figure of the past. Now in present time, his daughter Chaika seeks not revenge but a way to give him a proper funeral. It\u2019s safe to say that such ambitions would create controversy. By controversy also means opposition and resistance so naturally, Chaika often finds herself in danger. That is until her fateful meeting with Toru Acura and his foster sister Akari that she sees as hope to bring purpose in her journey. \\n\\n\r\nMysterious yet reliable, Chaika is a riddle in this show. As the titular character, she is both a wizard and prominent figure in this fantasy world as various factions seeks her out in attempt to avert another war. Her encounter with the Acura siblings can be interpreted as fate or one of those classic \u2018red string\u2019 folklores. But of course, there isn\u2019t any romance built from that in the beginning as their first encounter is also a bit peculiar. The reason being is that an abnormal unicorn attacks them out of nowhere and took their teamwork to bring down the beast. Odd as it all seems, the show has a surprising charm when it pulls this off elegantly. Despite being total strangers, they function well as a team and already has a potential as a group. Joining them as well is Akari, a girl with an unorthodox personality with her words and actions. Together, they make up a formidable trio when put together as a unity for their ability to accompany each others\u2019 abilities. This is evident throughout the show as they are able to survive and escape death during compromising situations. All the way, the show also adapts itself as a cat-and-mouse scenario as Chaika becomes a person of interest for capture by the Gillette Corps. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the premise and idea of the show being straightforward, it is also bounded by mysteries. Besides that though, we get an approach to identify and characterize the characters. Although a small group, they generate charm through their relationship building. The construction mainly details between Toru and Chaika as neither is similar but strangely provokes thought when putting the two together. It\u2019s not a romance tale per se but rather a story of journey. And throughout that journey, we find out more about all three of the main characters with various flashbacks. These flashbacks not only tell the characters of their pasts but also reasons as to why they are as of today in the present. But more importantly is how the show puts this all together effectively to mark this group as entrancing towards the audience. That\u2019s where the charm comes in as Chaika appreciates Toru and Akari to be more than just business partners. They become allies, friends, and even family-like throughout their journey. Specific events shows their progress and how they rely on each other for survival. Toru, a young warrior with skills he thought would be useless in the present world, suddenly now finds himself with purpose. With that in mind, it makes their journey all the more worth and something to truly treasure. The journey becomes more important than the destination.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show progresses, one could also realize the strange phenomenon going on. One prominent feature involves Chaika and her identity, as to who she really is and her purpose. Hints and foreshadowing are drawn out throughout the show as we find out more about her origins. One other aspect of the show that ties with this is a series of impersonation attempts that makes the whole concept more complicated as other characters tries to pass themselves off as \u201cChaika\u201d. Character identity isn\u2019t just an attribute though, as the show also has more emotional scenarios involving other characters such as the tragic Fredrica. Despite this, the show\u2019s mystery can also be staggering when it comes to execution. Some bits of the show feels predictable while other parts are resolved relatively quickly despite the built-up. And while the series isn\u2019t infamous to plot twists, the way it is executed isn\u2019t spellbinding enough to seduce the audience into taking them by heart.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I do take to heart though is the well-executed comedy. Whether it\u2019s Chaika\u2019s way of speech with her sentence fragments, Akari\u2019s borderline yandere behavior, or Fredrica\u2019s \u201cmurderous\u201d gags, the show does itself appropriately to balance the mood. There\u2019s hardly any explicit fan service either as the show focuses more on plot rather than substance. What we get from this show also involves a building chemistry between the three main characters. It\u2019s the kind of relationship that expands beyond than just companionship and business. It gets personal and build itself piece by piece, all the while by maintaining decent balance with its story. The structure and setup holds itself together as the show never staggers off from their journey. Whether its character focusing or plot direction, the show stays honest with sincerity. The show\u2019s magic mechanics are also explored with aesthetics whether it\u2019s Chaika\u2019s abilities with her large gun or other various spells. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the show stays consistent and delivers promise, there are bits that can steer people away from appreciating this adaptation. One problem is adaptation as the show does omit parts from the light novel to condense material for this one cour season. Also, the comedy delivery can be a mixed flag that fall into the clich\u00e9 hole. The incest innuendos does not hide itself and often or not portrayed repetitively. Even when it seems genuine, the show plays it off as a joke often with Akari\u2019s poker face and trollish behavior. Speaking of which, Akari herself is more of a comic relief with underdeveloped traits and aspects. One could see her as both a child and warrior with her personality that can be difficult to appreciate when  both traits fused into one entity. And finally, the antagonists of the show is underwhelming with their motivations. Hardly any of them are explored in depth when it comes to characterization. In general, the show delivers more of a story oriented product rather than a character-centric theater. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the show looks simple on the surface by artwork, there is actual decent amount to take in by fantasy standards. There is exceptional mileage with character designs to make the characters look distinctive. This is especially true for Chaika and the weapon she carries on her back. Not to mention, her eyebrows and albino hair stands out to show her as the titular character. She can look adorable while being badass all the same time. Similarly, Toru and Akari are designed to fit their personalities, almost like polar opposites. Elsewhere, the fantasy world is designed marvelously with its landscapes and structures. It looks convincing with the architectures and overall style with its natural backgrounds. The monsters and beasts of the show also gives off a mystical vibe but at the same time also demonstrates ferocity to stir up fear. Fan service is minimal with action taking more of its place along with some bits of violence. Thanks to Studio Bones, the action is well coordinated whether it\u2019s swordsplay, magic duels, or the sharpshooting curtsey of Chaika. In essence, the artwork ultimately captures the Old World feeling fitting for its fantasy genre.\\n\\n\r\nTo describe the soundtrack, I would say it\u2019s clean and precise. Set by fantasy standards, the OST does itself well for action oriented scenes, emotional drama, or the more humorous displays from our characters. The more you listen to the soundtrack, the more you will get out of it with its stylish charm. And speaking of charm, Chaika is the epitome of that in this show with her personality. Aside from her broken speech patterns, she has more a serious and childish side as being naive. Her voice mannerisms captures the very essence of that. Similarly, Akari\u2019s sisterly relationship with Chika and borderline yandere behavior with Toru are also drawn out with her tone. It\u2019s comedic and contagious just like most of the conversational dialogues. Furthermore, the OP and ED songs are fluid with consistency and sets a fantasy show by example.\\n\\n\r\nHitsgui no Chika is a superior example of how a fantasy show should be portrayed as. Despite some general tropes we can see and draw similarity with, the show decorates itself with tolerable lighthearted comedy. Its small yet distinctive character cast sheds light with their development. And although some bits of the adaptation fails to cover every solid detail, it ultimately steers its direction with consistency in terms of its premise and story. All in all, this show is a great chunk of fantasy recreation with appreciable ideas. With season 2 in the horizon, it would be a shocking truth to not check it out.\\n",

            "content": "Chaika? Yes, Chaika. Chaika.\r\nCreated by the author of Scrapped Princess and Outbreak Company, this light novel adaptation is part of Studio Bone's trio of shows in the Spring 2014 season. Surprisingly, I felt that Hitsugi no Chaika was the strongest out of the three with its quirky and well-constructed elements in the storyline, characters and action department. These things help create one of the more memorable fantasy adventure anime in recent years.\r\nSet five year after a war, which resulted in the dismantlement of the Gaz Empire, the world is now in a peaceful state much to the detriment of Toru, a saboteur who is capableof performing the ironblood transformation. Without any meaningful civilian employment skills, he spends his days, along with his sister, Akari, rotting away and waiting for the end to come. One day, while foraging for food in the mountains, he comes across a 14 year old girl carrying a coffin on her back. Eventually, she hires Toru and his sister to aid her on a quest to gather the remains of her father, who is no less than Emperor Gaz himself. Along the way, they meet the various heroes who kept a piece of his body when they defeated five years prior. On the trail of Chaika's party, is the Kleeman Corporation, commanded by Knight Gillette, who is commissioned to keep the peace and capture her. There are plenty of other factions and characters that connect to Chaika in some sort of way and each one only adds the mystery surrounding her existence. \\n\\n\r\nHitsugi no Chaika's world is curious mixture of old school fantasy and early 20th century technology. The various devices that are shown reflect this odd mashup of aesthetics like the communication room working like a Skype call or laser cannons/barrier shields mounted on a flying fortress. Traditional fantasy elements like monsters and spells exist alongside with the more modern gundos and automobiles making the setting unique among its peers. Chaika assume that the audience is smart enough to figure out the mechanics by giving out just enough information and letting the viewer fill in the rest of the blanks. Things that are casually mentioned become the center of focus several episodes down the line, like the magical fuel powering all machines and spell-based weapons. This fuel, paralleled to our gasoline and diesel, is the key concept behind the core plot, economic system, and thematic overtones of this anime. Like grades of fuel at a gas station, the Emperor remains are all in a class of their own, which becomes very apparent in the later episodes. As such, all the locales visited are interwoven through this plot device making the background feel authentic and consistent. From a town's bustling marketplace to the subdued atmosphere of a mining to an ominously unsettling interior of a floating castle, this world begs to be further explored by the viewer. Just be mindful of the demonic unicorns, roving packs of lightning wolfs and the fog of despair.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that a good portion the current anime  is overrun with loli, Chaika is a breath of fresh air because she is not defined by fanservice or  pointless antics. In her profession as a badass wizard, she brings the hurt through her magical sniper rifle while lugging around a ginormous coffin. In addition, she is a skilled mechanic driver, and one of the few people in the show who can operate magical devices. Aside from wrecking people's days from afar, there is a certain charming side to Chaika that many viewers can't help but be entranced by it. While her casting skills are formidable, her attempts at cooking are just downright hilarious. By attempt, I mean that firing her magical rifle at uncooked food counts as such. Also unrefined is Chaika's speech pattern, which is filled with fragmented sentences and the subject of many GIFs floating around the internet. \\n\\n\r\nToru, when contrasted with Chaika, is far more serious in his demeanor and outlook on life. Trained as a saboteur from his childhood,  his life lacks meaning in peacetimes and it is only when Chaika employs him that his mindset begins to evolve. While not as memorable as Chaika, he does have his moments of fun and is far from a cardboard cutout of a character. Although, they have completely different backgrounds, they both complement each other well both on a combat and emotional level. Both of them cover each other's weakness in combat as Toru is a close-quarters specialist while Chaika is a ranged caster. In their downtime, Toru acts as a guide and mentor to a very naive Chaika and in return, she gives him hope for a future that doesn't just involve fighting.  Their relational development is very well-done as it felt natural to have this pair grow closer together on this journey. \\n\\n\r\nProviding a majority of the comic relief, Akari, non-blood related sister to Toru, is deeply and madly in love with  him. Incestuous vibes seems to be all the rage right now but Hitsugi no Chaika does it in an approach that is more akin to siblings bickering, rather than full on eroticism. Toru is very much aware and rather annoyed of her feelings towards him. Her suspicious timely interventions are done in a deadpan manner and is played out for laughs rather than being a detriment to the overall show. The last character, Fredrica, to join up with Chaika is most certainly the wildcard out of the entire party. Being a dragoon, which is the equivalent of a nuclear weapon in fantasy lore, tends to overshadow any foe quickly. She is not present all the time when fights do happen but make her presence very felt when she does decides to show up. Overall, I do think that she is a fun addition to the cast being the bloodthirsty loli, and is essential for saving the day when the plot calls for it.    \\n\\n\r\nThe team under Gillette tracking down Chaika is a odd assortment of former soldiers who had nowhere to turn after the war. As Gillette is a man who believes in justice and is an idealist, they are grateful to the knight for his compassion and share his in vision to keep the peace. Not much time is spent on them but I don't consider them to be the antagonists as they are quite justified in their reasoning for chasing her down. One particular member, Viivi Holopainen, is one-noted character being her infatuation with Gillette as the defining point. In a series that has a good amount of depth to the main characters, the supporting cast is a bit of a disappointment when compared to them. Many other characters are encountered along the way and they all have their own story to tell. Some you feel sorry for, others will make you want to see them on the receiving end of Chaika's rifle.\\n\\n\r\nEasily one of the highlights of Hitsugi no Chaika, the fights are expertly choreographed, fast and brutal. This is where teamwork, tactics, and sheer skill triumphs over any overpowering foe or magical contraption. It smartly avoids the shounen trap of yelling out attacks and having character reaction shots by giving the audience a straight up brawl. One of the few things that I value when it comes to character is competence and it shines through during the action sequences. Each person in Chaika's party knows exactly where to go and what to do to place their opponents into overlapping fields of fire. Traps, ranged weaponry, blades strikes and  are often used in combination and in quick succession for maximum efficiency. Same goes for the opposing force as their composition is also a mixture of different class types and employ ambush tactics, which makes for some very entertaining clashes. It's not just humans that our protagonists faces for the world of Hitsugi no Chaika is filled with monsters and other very unpleasant things. A demonic-looking unicorn that shows up in the opening minutes sets the tone for how ruthless this show can be when it comes to its creature design.  \\n\\n\r\nThe weakest part of the show is, by far, in its visual department. It comes in a distant third when compared to Bone's other offerings  like the attractive looking Captain Earth and Soul Eater Not!. The problem stems from the lack of all the fancy shading, reflective flair and light bloom that modern anime seems to be so fond of, making it look rather low budget and something that aired years ago. Thankfully, the motion is fluid enough during its more intense scenes and it's only a small blemish in a show. I want to give props to the Seikou Nagaoka (Strike Witches and Pretty Rhythm) for a solid accompanying soundtrack as orchestral tones fits in well with Chaika's adventure.  The opening and ending are no slouches either.  Both, being of the rock genre, are filled with dark imagery and gives off a unsettling feeling that Chaika is caught up in something far greater than her goal of giving her father a final funeral.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom the reading up on the previews, I wasn't quite of what Hitsugi no Chaika was all about. To my pleasant surprise, it became one of my top shows of the season with it charming characters, seamless world building and excellent fight scenes. My gripes with Chaika is primarily with its comparatively low animation budget and the slightly weaker characters on Team Gillette. If I could give Captain Earth's entire budget to Chaika, I would do so in a heartbeat.  However, these minor concerns should not deter viewers from diving into this show as they will be greatly rewarded through the one person that stands in the center of it all.\\n\\n\r\nChaika. \\n\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n",

            "content": "Really interesting and straight-forward title if I do say so myself.\r\nLet me start off by saying that I really liked Chaika -The Coffin Princess- It reminded me of a video game so much with it's action sequences. A JRPG to be more precise. The intense amount of action made me feel like picking up my controller (yes controller, JRPGS should only be played via console!) and mashing buttons! The story is pretty simple. I really like that Ichiro Sakaki didn't add unnescary and complicated details about certain events or characters. I like that everything naturally  builds upon from the foundation. Like first we're introducedto characters, then the story, next the back-story and so on, which is why I say it's straight-forward. I like seeing simplicity in shows with settings placed in older times because it makes it easier to follow.  Perhaps the only thing I didn't care for was the speech of Chaika(s). Her... their, speech pattern was so annoying and in addition to that, I honestly didn't care for Chika Anzai, role this time around. I like her in Sound Euphonium and a few other titles but honestly.. I just had too many mixed feelings. Lastly, going back to the story again, I would've liked to see more character development in terms of the main characters strength. The fights are great and all but I like to see new moves and special techniques that the characters learned and there wasn't any of that in Coffin Princess. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was great, for the most part. I wasn't too keen on the actual character designs because I felt like there were a few too many characters with the same \"gothic\" style. Battle scenes were pretty great. I liked the magic battles especially towards the ending of the season 1. Everything became a lot more intense in terms of drama and the animation quality really improves the mood.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was pretty unnoticeable for the most part. I mean during fights the background music wasn't really intense of dramatic enough to get me exciting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hitsugi no Chaika is a pretty fun and enjoyable title. Again, and I cannot stress this enough it's pretty straight-forward so character has goal, character somewhat carries out that goal and so on. Overall I gave this title an 8/10 because it is indeed pretty  remarkable! Great story, good and like-able characters, and lastly, pretty awesome battles!",

            "content": "Hitsugi no Chaika is easily classified as a standard issue, steam punk style fantasy adventure anime, but it possesses enough quality in production and story to make it something you don't feel guilty about watching. \r\nThe first thing that stood out to me about the series was that the battles were actually animated. No reused scenes of stock \u201cmoves\u201d or fading to a screen of flashing lines while the hero screams as an attack. People actually swing swords, move, duck, dodge, and maneuver. Amazing isn't it? The \u201cguns as magic\u201d aspect is a little boring, but it is what it is and doesn't take toomuch away from the otherwise enjoyable fight scenes. \\n\\n\r\nGetting an engaging story is the other difficulty in adventure anime. Series tend to get dry with repetitive themes, boring fetch quests, or stereotypical villains that must be put down. Hitsugi no Chaika manages to be more than this, by providing a convincing world for the characters to inhabit and giving them a unique threat to deal with, mysterious agents of a supposedly defeated mage emperor. It takes time for the plot to unfold, there are a few twists involved, and it gives the series enough time for you to possibly develop some affection for the characters involved.\\n\\n\r\nWe probably won't be talking about this series as a ground breaker or classic for the ages years from now, but it's a solid production I have no trouble suggesting to fans of fantasy and/or action anime.",

            "content": "With the obvious big shot of the season being No Game No Life, a lot of otherwise also decent and sometimes even better shows get pushed in the background, while I think some of these deserved a bit more attention. One of these titles would be Hitsugi no Chaika (Chaika, the Coffin Princess) by Bones.\r\nJust like many other titles every season, Hitsugi no Chaika falls under the category of light novel adaptations and it has many things which indicates this, such as the medieval setting with a magic system. But at some points this anime was a bit different from usual light novel adaptations. Forexample we have no teenagers as protagonists, but fully grown adults. Well, except for Chaika Trabant that is. But Toru and his half-sister Akari are both adults and saboteurs who were used in war. But since the war is over for a while now, Toru and his sister have nothing to do and are easily bored and hungry since they have no jobs. This especially affected the character of Toru as he is constantly looking for the meaning in his life in the beginning of the show, as he still sees himself as a soldier. But a soldier in a land without war and in peace is useless. Thus on an errand to gather some food for his sister and himself, Toru then proceeds to accidentally cross the patch of the awkwardly speaking, coffin carrying and confused looking Chaika Trabant in a nearby forest. After an encounter with a unicorn which gets defeated by the two, Chaika - who turns out to be a sorceress who is a bad ass with her magic rifle- asks Toru and his sister if they could accompany her on her journey. They agree and thus their story begins. I won\u2019t go into further detail because light spoiler territory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is rather mediocre and not that worth mentioning to be honest, but it has a few twists and turns along the way. The setting on the other hand is a nice mix of a medieval post-war world, mixed with some steampunk elements, which can be noticed especially at the clothing of some characters as well as some machines like various vehicles and guns. What really hurt the immersion of the experience for me was the severe lack of world-building and background information to the characters themselves. After the 12 episodes of the series\u2019 first cour we don't really know that much about Toru's or Akari's past, which I personally found a bit disappointing. The world itself, besides looking pretty, doesn't offer any lore or explanations to really get invested in like say Attack on Titan or for a better example the Toaru Majutsu series does. Magic and how it works doesn't even get hinted in the slightest, and we just have to take it how it is. While this saves some annoying info dumps and boring expositions, it also spoiled my enjoyment a little, as I always would have loved to know what was going on when a spell was casted, Toru activated his blood-iron transformation, you name it, thus making the story part easily the weakest point of the show for me.\\n\\n\r\nBut thankfully, though we have a really lovely cast of characters to help the show along the way. Let\u2019s start off with our main trio which consists of Toru, Akari and Chaika. Later on we get one additional side character that is rather a plot device than a real character on her own in my opinion. Like she\u2019s just there to clear an obstacle or help a few times in battle but doesn\u2019t do too much besides that. The main three on the other hand serve the plot very well; none of them were annoying or hurt the experience for me. And when some battles take place - which is not a rarity - the whole group got involved into the battles. No one really stood at the side lines and watched, no. They were all active which made the well animated action scenes all the more powerful. Also great to look at were some of the saboteur tactics and gears used by Toru and Akari during said fights. While we not always get explained how they are used, they are always there in the right time and are used practically to make the battles appear a bit more strategic and thought out. This was an aspect of the show I really liked in the beginning, but when we advanced after the first half of the show things started to slow down a bit. The action was still there but not in the dimensions like in the beginning. But thankfully the last two episodes speeded up again and gave me more of the exciting action I was hoping for The character development of the main characters wasn\u2019t anything outstanding but noticeable, so it was there.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other side of the spectrum we have Gillette-sama and his companions, trying to stop Toru, his sister and Chaika from completing their goal of spoilers. Gillette is a soldier and nobleman trying to fight for the sake of good because they and the high class people think Chaika and her new found friends are a threat to the peace of the land. Toru and his group actually appear like the bad guys for a change as they are confronted by Gillette as they are supposedly the trigger for another war. Unlike every other light novel main character would try to fight for there to not be war, Toru doesn't really care. Why? Because he's a soldier, a weapon, and a weapon without a use is useless in his eyes. These made for an interesting change in perspective in the early parts of the show and made this show stand out from the usual clich\u00e9s and tropes a bit. Unfortunately they didn't really do anything extraordinary or worth mentioning with this premise later on...\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters were all likeable in my opinion, especially Toru and Chaika really grew unto me and I even understood the \"villains\" as they got a surprisingly huge amount of screen time during the course of the 12 episodes. Story wise it came to a satisfying conclusion with a cliffhanger plus an announcement for a second season in October. Count me in.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visual and audio the show didn't really do much to me to be honest. Even though the colors were bright and the character designs rich it somewhat looked cartoony and lacked detail at some points, pretty disappointing for a show made by BONES. Thankfully during the fight scenes when it wants to look good, it does. The soundtrack was sadly barely noticeable and the Opening as well as the Ending song weren't that outstanding either, but fairly alright for my tastes. Otherwise the soundtrack ranged from average to slightly above average.\\n\\n\r\nSo, we finally get to the verdict. Should you watch Hitsugi no Chaika? Well, that depends. On its own it's by no means a  special anime in any particular way, so it may be just another time sink for about 5 hours for you. But if you're trying to catch up with the less bad stuff of spring 2014, I'd definitely recommend you to check this one out. It may not blow your mind but I do think the hours with this were well spent and even if you\u2019re just looking for a small action snack, this one should do you well.\\n\\n\r\nScoreboard:\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 5/10 (okay premise but it didn't do much with it, lack of world building was disappointing)\\n\r\nART: 6/10 (pretty colors and character designs but an often lack of detail, good action scenes)\\n\r\nSOUND: 5.5/10 (just slightly above average as the OP and ED songs were alright)\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 6/10 (likeable characters but a lot of background info to them was missing)\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10 (I had a good time with it, only after the 1st half it slowed a bit down)\\n\r\n----------------------------\\n\r\nOVERALL: 5.5/10 (Mediocre)",

            "content": "Today i decided to do a review on a very underrated anime called Hitsugi no Chaika:\r\nStory:\r\nWhile the story and the premise arent very original (Scrapped Princess, Akatsuki no yona had a similar story and setting) the way its presented is godly something that many anime wouldnt be able to achieve in years, the execution was done perfectly, it was never predictable and in troughout the episodes they gave away a little piece of the puzzle, it looked has if you were trying to solve something that seemed awfully perdictable but it wasnt at all. The setting is generic has its presented in   aworld of magic with some kind of energy or \"mana\" (magic fuel) like in any other generic fantasy show.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nA very light novel-esque art, quite generic however the fight scenes were done really well, the character designs are somewhat Moe but it doesnt necessarly make the anime bad .. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and sound fit the show perfectly however not something to raise the bar at has it was quite average, the same goes for the background music and endings\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance you see the loli silver haired girl the obcessed sister and the generic guy possible love interest..

It will never be boring to watch  and the show has a particular diferent feeling from all fantasy generic anime out there.. I recommend to watch with Medium priority because a show like this is rather rare and of course its quite generic in other areas..\\n\\n\r\n7.80 out of 10",

            "content": "A standard JRPG story usually involves a group of heroes rising up to fight a large and evil empire. The group grows stronger as they journey across the world and find new allies and weapons along the way. Their final goal is to beat the evil boss, be it the powerful emperor or some supernatural force lurking in the shadows, to restore peace to the world. Their actions are glorious and heroic, and ultimately, their epilogues are ones of peace and happiness. \r\nIs life really so simple? Hitsugi no Chaika presents itself as the unofficial sequel to these stories, taking place a few years aftera large war that involved 8 heroes and an evil emperor. Its setting is relatively standard fantasy, with melee combat, diverse magic, and medieval architecture. Magic can be used for a multitude of purposes, from basic applications of light and heat, to combat applications of cutting and destroying, to general applications of powering vehicles, to advanced applications of mind-control and other shenanigans. However, mages are rare, and most magic is highly restrictive, requiring a source magic fuel and a magic application device in the form of a long gun. These mechanics make for some really interesting world-building and action, but thankfully, the show never dwells too much into explaining the mechanics, lest it fall into boring techno-babble and textbook info dump. \\n\\n\r\nEmerging from this post-war premise is our main protagonist, Toru, whose skills as a saboteur laid to waste as the world turned to peace. By chance, he runs into the other main protagonist, Chaika, who is a fairly competent mage, the daughter of the deceased Emperor Gaz, and one who seeks to gather the scattered remains of her father to give him a proper funeral. Here\u2019s the catch: her father\u2019s remains are strong sources of magic that were separately entrusted to each of the former eight heroes who defeated her father in the war. To gather the remains involves defeating all eight heroes and stopping everyone else who seeks those powerful remains for various reasons, among which includes the resurrection of the Gaz empire. As Toru, Chaika, Toru\u2019s sister Akari, and a sassy dragoon adventure around the world to achieve this goal, they are met with plenty of trouble from heroes, bandits, government agents, other ambitious adventurers, and various mystical beasts. \\n\\n\r\nAdventure has its fair shares of action and downtime, and the show makes great use of both. From the more passive moments of the story, the show maintains an effective balance between light comedy and serious business, sprinkling in healthy doses of witty quips and deadpan with meaningful backstory revelation and poignant character moments. I\u2019ll admit: even the more crude physical humor within the show cracked me up, and Fredrica\u2019s sense of play and trolling is a spectacle in itself. Within these lighthearted moments, amid Toru\u2019s sighs and Chaika\u2019s definitive expressions, is a sense of natural character chemistry forming between the characters. Trust becomes a foregone conclusion, and by the end of this season, it becomes obvious that the main group of four fight solely for each other, without concern of the views of righteousness or societal acceptance. \\n\\n\r\nThe action, animated by Studio Bones, is usual Bones quality. That is to say that the animation is consistently solid, and the choreography is excellent. From wired dagger maneuvering to dual wielding melee combat, the actions are swift, powerful, and clean, delivering both the visual splendor and the thrill of battle. The versatile magic makes fights interesting, as mages check the fighters with their range and utility (in crowd control), and there\u2019s always the steamroller dragoon Fredrica to consider as well. Fight scenes accompany the more plot-heavy moments of the show, and while the severity of the situation escalates through the course of the story, the action is kept suspenseful and thrilling throughout.\\n\\n\r\nOne pervading theme in Hitsugi no Chaika is the sense of purpose that motivates each character. What do the characters fight for? While taken for granted or simplified in various other action shows, Hitsugi no Chaika challenges this theme from multiple angles, all centered on the concept of loss. After all, Toru lost his reason to fight when the war ended. Saboteurs are not needed in a peaceful world. Fredrica lost her life partner, and Chaika lost much of her memory. Heroes in the war find their exceptional combat prowess to be meaningless in everyday life, and even commoners struggle with loss of purpose and the desire for something grander. These losses all occurred as a result of peace, and it puts to question the effects of war and the value of peace. Can everyone adjust to peaceful life after spending years on the battlefield? Is peace most desirable if people lose their reason to live as a result? Many turn to violence and power in desperation, while others waste away to nothingness. Even Toru\u2019s decision to help Chaika is highly questionable, as the emperor\u2019s remains can cause chaos and world instability if used by the wrong people. So what? Toru needs a purpose, and Chaika gives him one. Vague ideals of morality and justice cease to have meaning when one\u2019s own life seems worthless. \\n\\n\r\nCoupled with interesting mechanics, excellent action, effective humor, well-rounded characters, and a high-stakes conflict, Hitsugi no Chaika easily stands out as one of the my favorite fantasy adventures to come out in recent years. From personal enjoyment to critical appreciation, this show delivers, and makes me thirst for more. Thankfully, the wait won\u2019t be too long, as the second season is due in October. There\u2019s no such thing as too much Chaika, so please, more of this quality fantasy romp. And the dragoon.",

            "content": "Hitsugi no Chaika is based on a novel written by Sakaki Ichirou, whose \"Outbreak Company\" made \u200b\u200ba hit in the fall season last year. However, if you're expecting a moe comedy with big-chested kemomimis you will not find what you're looking for in Hitsugi no Chaika!\r\nThe story of Chaika and her coffin starts off with a BANG, we only get a few seconds to get to learn the protagonist Acura Tooru before the heroine makes her entrance with a bloodthirsty unicorn after her. Right here, the big adventure has already started.\r\nThe story follows Chaika, Tooru and his sister Akari with yet another companion on theirhunt for body parts. Yes, you heard me, body parts. These body parts happens to be leftovers from a late emperor, and of course these are very valuable and powerful. However, our lovable heroine's only wish is to gather >her father's< leftovers and bury him. Simple? Not by far. If you couldn't guess, Chaika is not the only one who wants these body parts. Yet, this is not all the story has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonists are a fun bunch of people with their own characteristics and personalities that make them fun in their own way. While Tooru's character is a very common one, it's hard not to like him in some way. The most interesting character is of course Chaika though, with her lovable innocence and incoherent way of speaking. She's pure as an iris, yet she's quite strong when it comes to magic. Akari is quite charming too, with her sarcastic tone and huge brother complex, but she's not anywhere close to Chaika.\\n\\n\r\nAlongside our heroes are yet another set of characters we get to know, giving us a chance to bond with the opposite side. I would not like to call them enemies, but they do want to put an end to Chaika's little journey. These are not evil people with fangs and big breasts, they are people who do what they think is right and they have their own problems they struggle with. \\n\r\nI was quite fond of this side of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses, more and more secrets surfaces, and the mysteries raves about our heads. It is when the story gets more and more complex and the main characters begin to realize that there's something they don't know, that it really starts to get interesting. The studio made a good job keeping the tension up, and no episode was particularly boring. However, some short arcs could have been made a little more interesting. Otherwise, the main story is really not bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design never ceases to fascinate me, Chaika is adorable and her dress is very creative and detailed. Some designs may seem a little weird, but they were definitely original and interesting to look at. It was nice that some of them were really colourful and really stands out from the environment.\\n\r\nThe animation is really nice, but since the animation quality has risen so much recently, it's hard to tell if it's that much better than many others. However, there weren't really anything that I found unpleasant, so I can't complain about it.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I loved was the beautiful backgrounds and the many colours we see in certain moments. They give a great impression of the fantasy world we're supposed to be in, and it hits me right in the heart. In one scene close to the end, I had to take several screenshots just because the artwork was so beautiful. \\n\r\nHowever, in \"unimportant\" scenes, the colours are pretty dull and not really that sparkling, so it has it's ups and downs.\\n\\n\r\nChaika's incoherent sentences was voiced by Anzai Chika, a name I had never heard about earlier. However, she did a great job and the voice fit perfectly. Most voices in HnK were unknown to me which was nice for once. Of course I have my favorites, but it's always nice to welcome new voices, and they were all talented and played their roles well.\\n\r\nThe music was fine, even though it was not the best I've heard this season, it's listenable. The opening theme is literally stabbing you in the chest with a sharp melody that fits the show's darker sides, and the ending follows the same theme but with a slightly softer voice. The opening and ending animation was quite nice and fitting, but I mostly skipped it since I couldn't wait to see what happened next.\\n\\n\r\nWith a charming heroine and a complex story, I give Hitsugi no Chaika an 8 for one of the best series in spring 2014.",

            "content": "Hitsugi no Chaika focuses on Chaika, the main character, who only has one meaning in her life that she knows of: to collect the remains of her dead father. If you're told you are nothing more than a tool involved in a larger plan, what would you do?\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story might strike you as that of a typical fantasy-adventure genre show, but it's not. It gives you a sense of mystery, as questions are left unanswered at first, to be answered later. The plot is not overly complicated and new ideas and plot twists are introduced not too suddenly. The one good thing is thatthere are perspectives from different sides. We don't just get to see a one-sided perspective from the main cast, but also views from other groups of characters, which was handled with enough care. The story might not be a masterpiece, but it certainly is enough to stand out from the large quantities of animes out there in some way. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art wasn't necessarily one of the strong points of the show because I've seen better styles, but was unique in it's own way. The animation was particularly good, because there weren't any particularly noticeable reused battle scenes. Since most battles each took place at different locations, in different environments, the animated scenes were mostly original each time. The character designs were alright, but nothing to make you fall for it, but not look away in disappointment either.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound played its role in this anime well. The opening and ending set the mood for the current episode and the next. The voices were fine, especially Chaika's voice, which conveyed her innocence, but also her determination. Akari's deeper and more mature voice added for a more diverse feel for the voices with a larger range.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nAs the story goes on, you'll not only find out more about Chaika, the main character, as she develops, but also about the side characters, as they develop. All the characters contribute to the plot and development of the main characters in some way, and aren't just there to keep the show populated. Some characters have are brimming with enough determination to keep you captivated in their goals. The Chaikas hold unique personalities even if known by the same name. The protagonist is somewhat stubborn and follows a code of honor along with her sister Akari, which is not overly stressed to the point it gets in the way of the plot. Akari has her fits of jealousy and adds some comic relief to the show, but in a enjoyable way. The main Chaika has an unbelievably strong will, despite her innocent and delicate stature. However, many characters have questions left unanswered, but there's a Second Season for that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nIt might just be me, because I like fantasy/supernatural genre animes, but I found this show captivating enough to keep me busy and continue with the show, as some episodes end in suspense. The show was fun at some points and serious at others. The \"fun\" part of it, wasn't relieved with fan service or simple jokes, but rather each moment felt natural with the story and wasn't a compilation of acts for the characters to act out on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall=8",

            "content": "Not too bad, it's a fairly interesting anime. I like most of the characters and it made a good job of keeping itself interesting. It's just that there's a lot of flaws, if it wasn't because of my enjoyment reaching a 7/10(not getting bored enough to lose my desire to keep on watching throughout the entire thing), I would've rated it 5/10 thanks to the many flaws and feeling of mediocrity in what could've been awesome if the author had done it right.\r\nThe world it's set in isn't bad and the settings of magic and its tools are pretty cool. The powers of the mcis also not bad, but it's a pity almost nothing is ever properly explained in terms of powers and how things work, it's shallow. The harmony between the mc team is fairly good and I especially liked the dragon girl, oh, no, the \"dragoon\" girl, gotta keep it \"unique\", right? (laugh)\\n\\n\r\nSo, well, I don't feel like explaining much more about what I like here, because honestly, there isn't that much, I just enjoyed the mood and developments to some extent, it had a relatively nice flow despite its shallowness and plot holes. Therefore, let's get on with some of the flaws that I noticed and which heavily impacted my score.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I can't say the characters are that realistic, even for a fantasy anime. Their motivations are weird and it often feels unreasonable. I also can't say I'm that fond of chaika unlike most other people, she's too innocent and \"pure\", by which I mean that she's quite honestly not cut out for this kind of anime. Her idiocy and quickness to believe anyone she meets and inability to be merciless and cruel turns me off completely. She's a liability, yet she gets her way because the mc can't say no properly. She's essentially going on a huge battle adventure where everyone's out to kill her, yet she keeps on with that stupid crap where she trusts people too easily and doesn't want to kill humans. Come on.\\n\\n\r\nThen we get to the mc, his sister and their powers. I am over and over again surprised at how they never actually seem to use their powers until it's way too late. It's obviously not that they can't, it's just that they decide not to and it ends with them getting defeated. As skilled and experienced warriors, they should know their own limitations and when to activate their powers, yet they don't and this happens so many times. Even if they need a few seconds to stand still and chant their little \"magic spell\" with their eyes closed, there are many times where they clearly had enough time for that and other times where they could've easily done so while being protected by their teammate or run away to do so. This can be quite frustrating when they get captured or defeated without fighting all-out. Well, it's even more annoying when they do power-up yet get f*cked in the a*s, excuse my language, by some random dude without power-ups, I mean, this guy trained since birth(well, since he could walk) and has all these special skills and even power-ups, yet he got easily owned by some guy that had no real training, at least nothing that could ever hope to come even close to the mc. That he's \"tired\" and that one of his arms had been stabbed just doesn't justify it, sorry, that's just not good excuses and it's just illogical and stupid, a cheap move to get more \"drama/suspense\"(which this series is extremely bad at in the first place). Well, sure, he turned the tables on the guy quickly with what was more of a low-blow than proper fighting(sacrificing an arm and pretending to be completely exhausted so that the guy let his guard down), I just don't feel like it was satisfying. Not asking for an OP mc, just one that can fight within the parameters he was assigned without getting weaker or stronger when the author wants him to.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I can't keep on writing, so let's finish up with the general setting. There are a lot of settings I don't agree with or like here. One thing is that you can turn memories into magic, it only feels stupid and unlikely.  There being a lot of chaikas and whatever else is really irritating as well, how can \"our\" chaika feel special if there's dozens people with the same role/appearance but different personalities out there? Hell, there isn't even any moving or good reason as to why they should gather the body parts, it's obvious from the very start they're just being used by someone and it's not hard at all to correctly guess who it is, it's way too obvious. The mc is just kinda bored so he decides to tag along while being with his brocon sister, that's the whole idea. Then they set out on a journey where their main opponents seems to be other chaikas and their teams, which is just boring, very boring. I can also tell you that the ending of this whole story was extremely bad as well, but that's not really season one so I won't go into detail.\\n\\n\r\nWell, so that's it. Kinda average anime, nothing much, but it's not a bad watch even so. The settings are uncomplicated and quite dull, there's lots of plot holes and the characters feel relatively shallow despite having their good parts as well. I just don't feel much spirit/zest here and the story is flawed at best, it's not a good thing when you honestly don't care enough about the characters to get affected when they, for example, get captured/mind controlled, when you don't even care if the villains to die or not even though they're obviously disgutsing human beings because you honestly don't really feel that much for the main characters. Giving it a 5/10 seems pretty reasonable, but I'm going to give it a 7/10 because that's what my enjoyment was overall, it managed to make me keep watching without feeling like it was too boring and stopping, and that seems to be the only important thing for everyone voting, otherwise there's no way the scores would ever be so high. Come on, almost every show is above 7/10 and so many votes you see rate it at 8, 9 or 10/10, there's just no way shows could deserve that if they didn't completely ignore whether it was truly a good, well-written story without flaws etc.",

But this show isnt what I thought it was. \r\nFor starters it is not something that will blow your mind, there are far better anime outhere. \r\nChaika, Coffin Princess is a light novel adaptation animated by Bones, and while the animation was nothing outstading, it had quality to it, it was vivid and colourfull.\r\nThe story focus on Chaika and her search for hers father's remains, to makehim a funeral... it may sound blant and void, but at first you dont even know this, as you wander who Chaika is and why does she want those remain...it even comes to a surprise to the other main cast, Tooru and Akari. Two sabouters, that choose to follow her with her's goals. Along the story they will confront enumerous enemies, and not everyone is bad or is fueled by evil intentions, some are actually kind and just people, ignorant of the real plot going by the sidelines. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and END had some nice sound to it, which I was glad for, since most of the times, anime OP and END came as boring and totally skipable. The END was really good, really emjoyed the whole vibe about it.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap it all, this anime can as a surprising gem, you may expect something different at first, and while throught the 12 episodes you may start to think this is going to be generic or boring, it never fully achieves it, the story can came as cliche at parts, but there is also some originality to it, and some surprises... and the cast was enjoyfull for the most part (Frederica, shut up with your fighting, you just want company!!). \\n\r\nWorth watching to kill time, good job Bones, definitly much better than Eureka Seven AO (last anime I have seen of them). Already watching second season, and it is a must if you found entertainment on the first season.\\n\r\n8.2",

            "content": "When you make a mystery oriented anime, an important thing to keep in mind when making an overarching plot is to never reveal the anime's mystery too quickly or the story will get boring, as well as never make the plot to convoluted or risk attention from the viewer.  But when you have a story that has to do with palette swapped girls in addition to a very peculiar overarching plot, well, now you've got something.  Hitsugi no Chaika, or, The Coffin Princess Chaika.\r\nStory (7.20/10):  In a postwar magical world, the land of the six allied nations is at peace, having haddealt with a big sort of world war that ended a few mere years ago.  The story follows our main protagonist Toru, a sort of mercenary for hired work known as a sabetour.  One day, he meets Chaika, a strange white haired carrying a coffin on her back whilst gathering food, (since he is poor, sort of).  After talking to her, he and his adopted sister Akari are hired by Chaika to gather the remains of her dead father scattered and held by all sorts of people, so that she may give him a proper burial.  \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is split into very apparent small arcs in its 12 episode time span.  Within every arc, we get basically the same thing, which is, a part of the dead emperor's remains, a little insight into the mystery of the whole anime, as well as a look into the after effects of the war and a bit of character development.  This for the series is rather formulaic, but, it works towards its favor.  This is due to the fact that every tidbit that we get is different depending on which part of the story you're in.  Personally, I like this, since the mystery of the anime is very clearly shown to the viewer, and it isn't obscured by a horrendous amount of other details and is actually rather straightforward.\\n\\n\r\nWhile i feel like the actual content of the story is fairly well done, one big gripe that was apparent to me from the very first episode is the show's pacing.  Mostly, pacing in anime is something I comment on and leave alone, but this show is quite different.  Many times in the series, the show has the same problem of rushing out details.  It's as if the creators wanted to make this somewhat slow intro to every arc, complete our main characters' goal, and then rush through the rest of the character detail or motives so that they can finish within the 23 minute time frame.  Personally, I find this quite unappealing because they just glaze over a lot of character details that in the end, we wouldn't really care about since the postwar drama story is more or less given to a character we will neither see nor hear from again.  (Except Fredirica, of course.)\\n\\n\r\nPrimarily, the pacing problem is very apparent in the first episode, since they do a lot of setting skips, putting our characters in one minute here, and another minute there.  (They kill a unicorn, eat lunch, get employed, and infiltrate a mansion all in the first episode.  If that's not rushed, I don't know what is.)  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story of Hitsugi no Chaika I feel was done well from a story perspective.  Details of the mystery were given at appropriate times, and the story was not completely spoiled.  Everything I felt made sense in some degree, and I was fairly intrigued by the story through the entire run of the anime.  On a negative side though, the pacing had something left to be desired, and the story was OBVIOUSLY incomplete with the ending of the series.  Like literally, it is a legitimate cliffhanger, and no one likes those.  (I will forgive this series slightly for the second season announcement at the end.)\\n\\n\r\nOVerview:\\n\r\n+  Good mystery\\n\r\n+  Easy to understand plot\\n\r\n-   Awful, uneven pacing\\n\r\n-   Cliffhanger ending.  (Seriously, anime studios.  NO ONE LIKES THESE.) \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.42/10):  In the anime world, character troupes have been beaten to near death as their overused characteristics are served to us every single season.  Thankfully, this series did not do anything of that sort, which, I am quite glad about.\\n\\n\r\nToru, our main protagonist is the aforementioned main character of the series.  As a sabetour, his main job is really whatever his employer tells him to do, which can range from killing people to not killing people.  As someone who was affected by the war, (mainly because he doesn't have a job now after not being a soldier of the war), he and his adopted sister Akari must try and make a living off of whatever they can really find.  I find him to be an interesting character due to the fact on how serious he takes his job.  He doesn't really have much of a moral compass, as he mostly views himself to be a tool to his master, told to do whatever he is ordered to do.  Calm in any situation with only the goal in mind, Toru is a character I found to be a pleasantly different main protagonist than ones in recent years.\\n\\n\r\nAkari is the other sabetour of the series, bearing a similar personality to her older adopted brother.  With the same sort of emotionless personality, Akari more or less does the same thing as Toru, following her master's orders, thinking of herself as a tool, and putting the goal in front of her own life.  Apart from that, she has a rather...obsessive personality with her adoptive brother, essentially cockblocking him in any situation with any other girl aside from her regardless of what the situation is.  Apart from that, Akari doesn't really have any other character traits.  She has a lot less character exploration than both Toru and Chaika, which is ok, but since she is a main character, I feel as though she should get at least a little bit of character development and backstory.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, we have Chaika, the character that is more or less the main focus of the show.  Chaika is a very interesting character for several reasons.  For one thing, her speech pattern.  Chaika speaks in a broken pattern where every \"sentence\" she speaks is spoken with only the important words said out loud, meaning that every conjunction, adjective, adverbs, and everything but the subject and predicate is missing.  From what we do see initially, Chaika is a somewhat naive character with a singular goal in mind, gather her father's remains.  For the majority of the series, that is what you see.  But, as the series goes on, her character both gets explored, as well as not getting deeper at all which sounds contradictory, but to me, is actually pretty interesting.  (Of course, elaborating further would be spoilers.)\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is split into two categories.  The first is the \"good guys\" featuring cavaliers and people who wish to maintain the peace of the country.  They don't get explored too much as characters, more or less playing the role of an \"opposing force\" to our main protagonists, but for being the characters they are they serve their role and some of them even get some \"development\" which I find to be interesting.  The other category of side character is the postwar group, the characters that are directly affected by the ending of the war.  For the most part, their characters are only really revolved around their war stories which is both a good thing, and a bad thing.  While they do get an interesting story to them that adds a little bit more flavor to this world that we're presented, you won't really remember their character names or appearances at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good main characters\\n\r\n+  Interesting supporting cast stories\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.08/10 and 7.31/10):  Hitsugi no Chaika was made by Studio Bones, a studio that is well known to do rather high quality work, and this show is no different.  Hitugi no Chaika is a very detailed looking show, from its backgrounds, to the magical circles, to the actual character look.  (Seriously, just look at Chaika's outfit.  That thing takes some time to draw.)  The show is more or less standard fare for the studio, but in terms of animation quality to other shows, Hitsugi no Chaika is very nice looking.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for the series was sort of...meh.  The opening for the series isn't really fantastic sounding in any way, but for some reason, it's a song that I can't get out of my head.  It has a very unique sound to it, but it never stood out as an extremely memorable tune.  (Though it is catchy.)  The ED is similar, in the sense that it has a very unique sound to it, whilst also being not as memorable as it could be.  It's not to discourage the series's songs in any way, as they are listenable and rather good, but they aren't the best things ever.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Very nice animation\\n\r\n+/-  Decent soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (7.41/10):  The first episode of this series really felt unfulfilling.  Nothing really was explained there and I was slightly boggled by what was going on due to the horrendous pacing.  But, as I continued watching, the initial thoughts I had of the series became more and more positive.  I was very intrigued by how the series was being played out due to the sort of plot twist as the series progressed.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like it?\\n\\n\r\nYes, I did.  This series had a very original idea story idea and never ceased to bore me.  I was always intrigued by what would happen next, and how the story would play out in addition to the intriguing characters that were playing a part in the series.  \\n\\n\r\nIs the anything I personally didn't like?\\n\\n\r\nYes, there is.  For one thing, I didn't like the way the show was paced, that was something that bugged me in this show.  Another thing was the sort of awkward \"romance\" that happened in the final episode because for me, it felt somewhat forced to put that sort of connection between two characters.  (Plus, Chaika is like 13 and Toru is 20.  Pedophilia anyone?)  Also, Chaika's eyebrows.  Enough said.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it to watch?\\n\\n\r\nIf you are interested in an anime that focuses on magic and an overarching mystery, then I would recommend you watch this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: (7.62/10)  Luckily, there's a second season, or this score would be lower.",

            "content": "So recently, a lot more light novels have been adapted to anime (as well as manga), to varying success (They didn't do it much before because of how poor the adaptations were, like Densetsu Yuusha). Most of them add a lot more fanservice than the originals, probably to give them some value in the case they turn it into complete garbage (ideal example of this is the second season of Infinite Stratos). Hitsugi no Chaika is another one of these adaptations, though it is quite different from its peers.\r\nStory: 9\r\nWhile it's nice that the synopsis doesn't really spoil anything, it doesn't actually tell you anythingeither. The premise (settings, backgrounds, and such) isn't particularly unique, but the story is interesting and not too cliched.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art is of a much older style than what is popular nowadays, and they didn't bother adding tons of fanservice either. Art of course is a personal preference, but older art styles can be nice, where they don't just go around making girls have stupidly shiny skin (as if they were gladiators that oiled themselves every day), and guys being stupidly angular.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe sound is fine; they didn't do anything spectacular, but it's fine. I really like the theme songs though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nWhile many light novel adaptations (mostly ones with high fanservice) would try to make the pace of the anime insanely slow, (with an episode exclusively about one character cooking, or something like that) and make several seasons of the same stuff with no development (allowing them to milk more $), Hitsugi no Chaika does the opposite and completely jumps the gun, skipping out on tons of detail, characterization, and somewhat importantly, explanation. All of the aforementioned are present in the novels, and the lack of can make this anime confusing, or make people unentertained, and pretty much not \"get\" things. (it's mostly character though). The anime adaptation is missing a LOT, and all I can say is that it could have been done better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nAs many may have noted, this anime is quite underrated. The truth is, people nowadays want and expect fanservice to go along WITH whatever it is they like to see in an anime; interesting plot, likeable characters, clever and entertaining dialogue etc. If there's a female character, they'd better make her show some skin, because that'll make people like it more, whether they realize it or not. I've no idea how well it's received in Japan, but for being different, Hitsugi no Chaika is most certainly lacking in love.",

            "content": "Well, that was an...average anime. Pretty much the definition of meh-ness, the meh-est of meh, so to say. Hitsugi no Chaika, or Chaika the coffin princess a first looked to me like a fairly typical adventure anime in the style of FMA or even Berserk without all the rape and robot arms, if you get what I'm saying. Just some colorful people on a journey with a magical objective. And that is what you get with this show, just not to the extend of the aforementioned shows. What's left is, at least after the first season, a pretty fun, at times boring and overall verygeneric kind of little show you will certainly forget about rather quickly. \\n\\n\r\nAt first though, let me talk about setting, characters and the like. The show is set in a fantastical world, filled with magic bullet spells and animals looking like somebody had to much time on their hands while having to design a unicorn for example. This left at least the creature of the first episode for example to be a bit overdesigned, but also interesting looking. When you played any of the Tales games, you will fell yourself at home here. That though is also one of my major gripes I have with this show. If you are in any way familiar with these kinds of shows, you will find the world of Chaika to be quite boring and uninteresting. Designs of the creatures gets even duller, as the show progresses, so there is that. No upwards trend there, I guess. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are for the most part nothing to write home about either. Toru is our standard anime protagonist for the day and does not have anything to him, worth writing about him here. Chaika herself seems to at least have an objective which makes her character a bit more thick layered, but her speaking quirk is the only mentionable thing about her in quite the same way. That leaves us with Akari, who has at least a bit of a character, even if she is all over the place in therms of consistency about her mood and such. She was the only character I was not indifferent to on the other hand, but that rather says something bad about the rest of the cast, than something good about her. The pseudo-anthagonist is generico-bad-but-really-just-honorable-boring-straight-guy bored me to bollocking tears and his party of sleeping pills was no different. The dragon I won't mention because the show did not mention even some personality about her either. Fair is fair. \\n\r\nAlso their names...ugh. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation was quite solid for the most part. Some hiccups here and there, nothing really special overall, but serviceable. Character designs, like I said are a bit overdone sometimes, in therms of clothing and all. Characters might have to be distinguishable from the crowd of background people, but this went overboard and came off looking quite silly. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the writing though, this show drops the ball almost completely in trying to invest me into the story. I got bored in the first third of the show and could not be bothered to be invested and thrilled right up until the final moments. They had one minor reveal, that could have potential, but nothing mind blowing or even something close to that. There was just so much potential lost and the concepts that were subject to the story were never that exiting or just too thinly spread across one or two episodes. \\n\\n\r\nNever using Gillette ever again though, I mean jeez...why even? Can't you think of any other names or is that a weird thing I don't know about again? You tell me.",

            "content": "Suprisingly good.\r\nAs a girl, the overdone harem vibe didn't do much for me and there were times in the beginning that I found Chaika annoying. The characters are not particularly deep, they are a bit like stereotypes, and some episodes seem to have no point or impact on the story. Despite all that, by the end I was reluctantly impressed. \r\nThe world-building was admirably done. It's taken the stereotype of a fantasy kingdom and inverted it. The princess carries a coffin and causes trouble, the unicorns are wild and dangerous beasts, and the system of magic is - like our modern fossil fuels - basedon powering the present with the remains of the dead. I also found it interesting that they've done away with the stereotype of all the regular people desiring peace and prosperity at any cost - these peasants desire war in a plausible and human way. \\n\\n\r\nThe princess's story arc is also remarkable. It's not the stereotype of an ordinary girl finding out she has a great destiny and learning to accept that responsibility, fight, and eventually rule. From the beginning there is no question that the princess has a special destiny. The question is whether it's a noble destiny, or a mission ordained by the devil. How will Chaika interpret her destiny, and what consequences will her actions have? because they may not all be positive. Like an dark alternative \"Scrapped Princess\" intended for a male audience we wonder about the princess's destiny. Is it to destroy the world or save it? But somehow the question of the ultimate outcome of the heroes' journey takes a back seat to the question \"What do they, what does the princess, intend to do?\" The hero in particular has no noble intentions, he acts nobly because he has a soft heart and a savior complex.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime to others? Sure. Do I think it's necessary or interesting to watch every episode? Not really, no.",

            "content": "Mod Edit: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nChaika The Coffin Princess Review:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nA top down mediocrity that is just as good as giving You heaps of junk food rather than a fine home-made cake.\r\nREVIEW:\r\nThe so called power known as \u201cMagic\u201d (yeah how original) can feel vaguely explained at times, like how the protagonist uses iron blood to make himself glow red and that apparently makes him stronger? Though this kind of vague explanation is probably left for the best since Mahouka made an awful job for itself...\r\nCharacters do seem badly directed, but for a show that exceeds in self-awareness it does seem quite flawed. To summarise: It's oneof those shows that You only gobble it for the action, though it is heavily action oriented especially sine the show constantly likes to make some stupid looking excuse just to see a flying castle firing death lasers on the capital city that is using Young girls as a fuel source because of some scientific magic stuff. It further emphasised this with other plot continence gibberish like how this Dragoon lady was clearly dead, but oh wait, she was resurrected because Dragoons are reborn as a chibi person when they die.\\n\\n\r\nTorou is a bare-bone generic main, if he was a tad serious with the whole duty being an overly devoted mercenary that has a back story that makes little sense of such motives a sister as his tsundare with some signs of incest and chaika, the ditsy moe girl that so many k-on tards infatuate themselves into. Yes, you can already tell this is not meant to be a serious show if the first few minutes was a loli using a magical sniper rifle to chop a unicorn in half and the whole thing about finding the missing body parts of her father to do a resurrection ritual is quite silly.\\n\\n\r\nIt had  moments when it loses consistency and tries to be serious, like how Torou shows he's devotion to Chaika as the Anime tried to make it look like a really serious scene, but on the flip side, the majority of what followed previously was nothing but a light hearted action show that Your meant to consume retardedly.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters do lack depth, development, personality since there all just  cookie cutter, and they do lack a feeling of a greatly executed character, You don't really feel anything with these guys and there motives feel more like an excuse to increase the body count. They never develop,  grow stronger or let nothing happen  to them at all which is not character development. I'm not saying its bad, it did achieve for what it was trying to do, but something like JoJo Crusaders which at least attempted on making characters feel self-aware in the environment, but in here, the cookie cutters don't feel justified to really be immersed in the world they live in, which therefore keeps a middle face. However, at this point, all what You ever wanted see is just the action alone and not anticipating old Joeseph spouting some of the best engrish ever.\\n\\n\r\nAt least Bones made a simple plot that You can understand, unlike some abomination like Darker Than Black, but for what its worth: Character designs are not very consistent, and many \u201cActual\u201d side characters are completely cheap. The colour scheme is rather bland, and just has all of Your typical greys, artificial like colourings and monster designs that are not meant to be taken seriously. Though the animation keeps a very consistent budget, and the action scenes look very crisp, cool, and You can tell there was effort put into making such scenes look as choreographicly sharp as it can be.\\n\\n\r\nOnly having 4 quality songs in the OST, and with that much money to be put on quality over quantity, it is a great sound track. It has this purely orchestral and classical like vibe to it. You listen to this sound track at Your own, and You feel such effort from each song as it shows very genuine emotion and heart. It uses a large variety of harps, pianos, violins, trumpets, drums and any orchestral instruments You can think of. Sure its tiny, but its not one that You would get so bored of so quickly...\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nI watch it, and all what I remember was people fighting each other for the silliest reasons, though it is self-aware, it does serve the job for You to eat some action like a bag of crisps. People look at this show, watch this show, and then forget it as another mediocrity. Season 2 You may ask? Its bound to be the same thing to continue the story line... (no need to make a review about that)\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n5/10 \u2013 The story is just all about every plot excuse to create action scenes while knowing what it wants to be.\\n\r\n4.5/10 \u2013 Archetypes are a little bothersome... Though they serve a mediocre purpose, it could've been better.\\n\r\n6.5/10 \u2013 Mediocre budget, and cool action scenes\\n\r\n7/10 \u2013 Suck it Mozart.\\n\r\n5/10 \u2013 Do I enjoy mediocrity? *Pulls a straight face*\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 5.5/10 Because all what I want to see is ACTION without art.\\n",

            "content": "First and foremost, I went into Chaika without greatly high expectation as I hadn't heard too much about it, it was one of the least hyped shows airing at the moment.\r\nAnd it turns out that it was also one of the most underrated!\r\nSo let's begin...\r\nStory - 9/10.\r\nThe story of this anime may not look particularly original if you only read the synopsis, but getting into it it provides a really satisfying adventure-filled romp through various places. I didn't find the story either too simple or too complex, it was filled with just the right amount of twists and turns and didn't overcomplicate itself with overlywordy explanations, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't pay it full attention, as it's full of little details. What also made this enjoyable to me was the lack of fanservice - a nice refreshing change from a lot of the anime currently airing (similar to WIXOSS), which I think would have detracted from the story. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10.\\n\r\nAlthough it may not be the \"standard\" anime style, I really enjoyed the art of Chaika. It was refreshing and original, and I thought it gave the characters actual character. It looked really nice in HD and the colours were fitting - dark and gloomy when the mood called for it, and lighter neutral tones when needed. I also enjoyed the fact that Frederica (sp?) was not animated in 3D - this can often look clunky and out of place in anime, so it was nice to see. The 3D animation that there was (the air ships, some of the magic effects) actually fit in nicely with the overall art style and did not detract from the anime at all. The fights were also really well animated - they didn't look ridiculous, or impossible, instead going for a more believable style.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10.\\n\r\nWhat I really liked about Chaika was not the sound, although a really good job was done with it. The opening theme, DARAKENA, is catchy and sets the mood for the anime quite well, and the background sounds within the anime were fitting - the mood was also set by little piano parts and punchier music. The characters' voices were excellent for their character - they could have made the mistake of making Chaika too \"moe\", and although her voice was pretty high pitched it never seemed to fall into that trap, at least not for me. It portrayed her apparent innocence very well. I also liked the fact that Akari's voice was a bit more mature sounding, as often in anime now even girls in their 20s sound like they are 5, which is frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10.\\n\r\nAnd here we come to my favourite part of Chaika. The cast of characters I thought was phenomenal - you have the two main characters, Toru and Akari, brother and sister but not by blood, Chaika, the coffin princess, Frederica the dragoon and a host of other side characters, each of which added something to the story. The interactions between the main characters are funny, sometimes adorable and always somewhat believable. Akari is obsessed with Toru, but it's a running gag that this show does not overuse so it doesn't come across as needy and annoying. And they both have an actual personality to support such gags, as opposed to them being essentially token characters. Chaika is a bit of a mystery - she seems innocent and pure, however throughout the story she is made to doubt herself and her purpose. I can't say much more without spoiling the story.\\n\r\nI found even the side characters had their place in Chaika, either adding another bit of comedy, seriousness and depth - the mysterious entity telling Chaika where to find remains, Gilette-sama and his band of followers and various other parties are met along the way and they all add a little something more to Chaika.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10.\\n\r\nOf course I very much enjoyed Chaika, I thought it was a fun, heartwarming and exciting experience. I fell in love with the characters very quickly, they're so well written and none of them seem out of place.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys a fun adventure story with bits of comedy and a lot of magic.",

            "content": "Every season there are a handful of shows that are overlooked and underrated. Hitsugi no Chaika takes this fact, and shoves it down peoples' throats by making itself even more underrated. Before the Spring 2014 season began, I had mediocre expectations of Chaika. But sooner than later, I found myself as one of the lucky ones to stay with it all the way through.\r\nStory: 8\r\nAt first glance the plot of Hitsugi no Chaika may seem \"dull\" or \"cliche\", but Chaika ultimately stands to deliver a fresh, new kind of plotline that is rather unprecedented in my opinion. It's not often you find adventure shows withthree characters traversing the Earth and having badass fights every episode. Personally, the story saves Chaika from mediocrity and adds a lot of originalty.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 7\\n\r\nOkay, yes, the art style of Chaika was probably the largest turn-off for most people. But all in all, the art actually complimented the show quite nicely. Although Studio Bones did choose an original style, overall it doesn't really compete with some older anime. The animation however was decent enough, and each fight scene was very engaging, especially considering how they fought. Another thing about the art that stood out were the 3D magic effects. On their own they looked nice, but together with the normal art made it seem out of place most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe sound/music of Chaika is arguably one of the highest points in the show. The voice actors for Toru and Akari fit their personalities and roles quite well. Chaika herself stands out the most...why? Well...Her actress did portray Chaika well enough, but at times her voice did make her a little annoying. Also the opening (DARAKENA) is an Excellent choice for the show's tone. Personally, I couldn't get through it each episode without replaying it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nThe three main characters: Chaika, Toru and Akari are definitely some of the most original characters I've seen in a while. Both Toru and Akari are perpetual badasses, and while they don't have much of an outstanding personality, they are still very likable. Now, Chaika is a cute character and all, but most of the time I found myself getting very annoyed with her character because she doesn't do much more than just sit back and act as the show's Damsel in Distress.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI think it goes without saying that this is very enjoyable show. Not necessarily a diamond in the rough, but definitely something that will keep your eyes peeled almost every minute.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nHitsugi no Chaika is definitely one of those shows that was massively overlooked during it's respective season. One thing, if any, is that Chaika does not fail to administer a dose of \"originality\" something that most anime seem to lack nowadays. Something as refreshing as Hitsugi no Chaika is meant for everybody, and should not be missed by anybody.",

            "content": "It\u2019s always difficult to review shows like Hitsugi no Chaika - ones that are clearly enjoyable to watch, but not necessarily of high quality. The characters are nice, though flat; the world is mysterious and intriguing, though it doesn't remain so; and the politics and ideologies are interesting, though simple. It\u2019s the type of show you might marathon some lonely weekend, enjoying as you watch it, and then completely forget about. \r\n       The show takes you through the adventures of Chaika Trabant, Toru Acura, and Akari Acura to recapture the remains of a deceased, tyrannical king - Emperor Gaz.The king was a \u201cbad guy\u201d who loved war, and thus the question throughout the series is whether war is a positive or negative good. Don\u2019t expect this to be investigated too much; this is not one of the better shows on the morality of war, like Now and Then, Here and There. But they do interesting things with the motif. Along with that, questions of identity begin to pop up, prominently for Chaika but also for others; the question of how we determine and relate our identities to what we think, or what history claims, us to be becomes a formative point for a variety of characters. \\n\\n\r\n      Many of the other reviews seem to praise the storyline - and I can see why. There is a sense of scope, of ambition, in the epic suggestions the story attempts to suggest. But to end a review at what the show attempts to do, and to forget how it actually turns out, does a disservice to readers. There are little interesting details, but Hitsugi no Chaika doesn\u2019t do this particularly well. There is a vague alliance of nations - the Six Nations - that serve as the constant backdrop to the adventures of our hero and heroines - they really only come into play when the show wants to show how badass the villain is, who will inevitably destroy their slow fleet. They might be vaguely based on European kingdoms. That \u201cbad\u201d king? He ruled for a long time, did bad stuff with magic. Never really elaborated. You will never truly be invested in the world Hitsugi no Chaika describes, because we\u2019re not really meant to be invested in it.\\n\\n\r\n\tRather, we\u2019re drawn to the characters. Toru Acura is a lazy bum of a saboteur, one bored dry by the armistice with the Gaz Empire drawn up fifteen years prior. His passion for fighting and the saboteur lifestyle has led him to become idle in the era of peace. Akari, his sister, is...well, into her brother. That\u2019s really her most important quality. The show plays up her fascination to outrageous, hilarious degrees. Chaika, with her adorably broken Engrish, grows and develops as a character during their adventures to retrieve Emperor Gaz\u2019 body parts. Soon others pop up too, but the focus remains on the core three - for awhile, at least. Again, don\u2019t expect too much here. The characters are nice, but nothing to write a paper on.\\n\\n\r\n      Peppered throughout are plenty of adequate action scenes - occasionally, they\u2019re even awesome, though only occasionally. The fights are distinguished by teamwork and cooperation, which give an exciting and tangible feel to an otherwise confusing battle system. For example: Toru and Akari - both hired by Chaika as saboteur bodyguards - heighten their powers via the Iron and Blood Transformation, an unexplained technique that, well, makes them more durable. Why? Because lineage, one supposes. The music is decent, nothing extraordinary. Decent art - nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\n      Clearly I\u2019m not enamored by the series - but I tuned in to watch it, and its sequel, every week. As long as you don\u2019t expect too much from the show, I recommend it to everyone - especially to those who love a series that hints at a large, almost epic scope. I don\u2019t think the series really keeps that hope alive for very long, as most of the promising things about the series fail to live up; they are, instead of becoming great, wholly adequate. \\n\\n\r\n     Chaika might be among the most adequate shows I\u2019ve ever seen - everything is fine, nothing is particularly great. I don\u2019t intend to pretend that this show is worth a particularly high rating - it simply is not relative to other anime series, and I think anime scores should be, in some fashion, relative to the quality of other anime. Don\u2019t let the numbers deter you, though - we all easily gravitate towards 10s and the like. Sometimes a light, lower score is still worth a watch - often, in fact. Chaika is an instance of a show that does everything alright - sometimes bad, sometimes good, but rarely great - and can entertain you without blowing you away.   \\n",

            "content": "At first glance, Hitsugi no Chaika (Coffin Princess Chaika) may be interpreted as a cheesy adventure. We get a trio of characters traveling on a sort of journey across the continent in a fantasy realm. And one of those characters is a young girl named Chaika with mysterious origins while carrying a coffin almost twice her size. As peculiar as all this sounds, the show has an alluring premise filled with mysteries and charming moments. From these moments also draws forward an ability to make the audience follow its story. And trust me, it\u2019s worth every single minute.\r\nFirst thoughts coming into this show is adaptation.After all, the show is based off of a light novel of the same name. The show isn\u2019t unique or a solitary premise considering the idea of traveling and adventure. But what rains this show with wonders is the progress as an adventure to capture and deliver its message. Communicating that message takes effort but thankfully, this show aces through that with its story, characters, and abstractions. What the show offers is a bit more than just an odyssey but story value and integrity.\\n\\n\r\nThe journey our characters are part of takes place in a fantasy world where a past war resulted in various circumstances. In retrospect, the show identifies itself with its premise and follows it through with clever usage of historical events. These include the 200-year war that ended 5 years ago as well as the death of Emperor Arthur Gaz, a prominent figure of the past. Now in present time, his daughter Chaika seeks not revenge but a way to give him a proper funeral. It\u2019s safe to say that such ambitions would create controversy. By controversy also means opposition and resistance so naturally, Chaika often finds herself in danger. That is until her fateful meeting with Toru Acura and his foster sister Akari that she sees as hope to bring purpose in her journey. \\n\\n\r\nMysterious yet reliable, Chaika is a riddle in this show. As the titular character, she is both a wizard and prominent figure in this fantasy world as various factions seeks her out in attempt to avert another war. Her encounter with the Acura siblings can be interpreted as fate or one of those classic \u2018red string\u2019 folklores. But of course, there isn\u2019t any romance built from that in the beginning as their first encounter is also a bit peculiar. The reason being is that an abnormal unicorn attacks them out of nowhere and took their teamwork to bring down the beast. Odd as it all seems, the show has a surprising charm when it pulls this off elegantly. Despite being total strangers, they function well as a team and already has a potential as a group. Joining them as well is Akari, a girl with an unorthodox personality with her words and actions. Together, they make up a formidable trio when put together as a unity for their ability to accompany each others\u2019 abilities. This is evident throughout the show as they are able to survive and escape death during compromising situations. All the way, the show also adapts itself as a cat-and-mouse scenario as Chaika becomes a person of interest for capture by the Gillette Corps. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the premise and idea of the show being straightforward, it is also bounded by mysteries. Besides that though, we get an approach to identify and characterize the characters. Although a small group, they generate charm through their relationship building. The construction mainly details between Toru and Chaika as neither is similar but strangely provokes thought when putting the two together. It\u2019s not a romance tale per se but rather a story of journey. And throughout that journey, we find out more about all three of the main characters with various flashbacks. These flashbacks not only tell the characters of their pasts but also reasons as to why they are as of today in the present. But more importantly is how the show puts this all together effectively to mark this group as entrancing towards the audience. That\u2019s where the charm comes in as Chaika appreciates Toru and Akari to be more than just business partners. They become allies, friends, and even family-like throughout their journey. Specific events shows their progress and how they rely on each other for survival. Toru, a young warrior with skills he thought would be useless in the present world, suddenly now finds himself with purpose. With that in mind, it makes their journey all the more worth and something to truly treasure. The journey becomes more important than the destination.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show progresses, one could also realize the strange phenomenon going on. One prominent feature involves Chaika and her identity, as to who she really is and her purpose. Hints and foreshadowing are drawn out throughout the show as we find out more about her origins. One other aspect of the show that ties with this is a series of impersonation attempts that makes the whole concept more complicated as other characters tries to pass themselves off as \u201cChaika\u201d. Character identity isn\u2019t just an attribute though, as the show also has more emotional scenarios involving other characters such as the tragic Fredrica. Despite this, the show\u2019s mystery can also be staggering when it comes to execution. Some bits of the show feels predictable while other parts are resolved relatively quickly despite the built-up. And while the series isn\u2019t infamous to plot twists, the way it is executed isn\u2019t spellbinding enough to seduce the audience into taking them by heart.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I do take to heart though is the well-executed comedy. Whether it\u2019s Chaika\u2019s way of speech with her sentence fragments, Akari\u2019s borderline yandere behavior, or Fredrica\u2019s \u201cmurderous\u201d gags, the show does itself appropriately to balance the mood. There\u2019s hardly any explicit fan service either as the show focuses more on plot rather than substance. What we get from this show also involves a building chemistry between the three main characters. It\u2019s the kind of relationship that expands beyond than just companionship and business. It gets personal and build itself piece by piece, all the while by maintaining decent balance with its story. The structure and setup holds itself together as the show never staggers off from their journey. Whether its character focusing or plot direction, the show stays honest with sincerity. The show\u2019s magic mechanics are also explored with aesthetics whether it\u2019s Chaika\u2019s abilities with her large gun or other various spells. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the show stays consistent and delivers promise, there are bits that can steer people away from appreciating this adaptation. One problem is adaptation as the show does omit parts from the light novel to condense material for this one cour season. Also, the comedy delivery can be a mixed flag that fall into the clich\u00e9 hole. The incest innuendos does not hide itself and often or not portrayed repetitively. Even when it seems genuine, the show plays it off as a joke often with Akari\u2019s poker face and trollish behavior. Speaking of which, Akari herself is more of a comic relief with underdeveloped traits and aspects. One could see her as both a child and warrior with her personality that can be difficult to appreciate when  both traits fused into one entity. And finally, the antagonists of the show is underwhelming with their motivations. Hardly any of them are explored in depth when it comes to characterization. In general, the show delivers more of a story oriented product rather than a character-centric theater. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the show looks simple on the surface by artwork, there is actual decent amount to take in by fantasy standards. There is exceptional mileage with character designs to make the characters look distinctive. This is especially true for Chaika and the weapon she carries on her back. Not to mention, her eyebrows and albino hair stands out to show her as the titular character. She can look adorable while being badass all the same time. Similarly, Toru and Akari are designed to fit their personalities, almost like polar opposites. Elsewhere, the fantasy world is designed marvelously with its landscapes and structures. It looks convincing with the architectures and overall style with its natural backgrounds. The monsters and beasts of the show also gives off a mystical vibe but at the same time also demonstrates ferocity to stir up fear. Fan service is minimal with action taking more of its place along with some bits of violence. Thanks to Studio Bones, the action is well coordinated whether it\u2019s swordsplay, magic duels, or the sharpshooting curtsey of Chaika. In essence, the artwork ultimately captures the Old World feeling fitting for its fantasy genre.\\n\\n\r\nTo describe the soundtrack, I would say it\u2019s clean and precise. Set by fantasy standards, the OST does itself well for action oriented scenes, emotional drama, or the more humorous displays from our characters. The more you listen to the soundtrack, the more you will get out of it with its stylish charm. And speaking of charm, Chaika is the epitome of that in this show with her personality. Aside from her broken speech patterns, she has more a serious and childish side as being naive. Her voice mannerisms captures the very essence of that. Similarly, Akari\u2019s sisterly relationship with Chika and borderline yandere behavior with Toru are also drawn out with her tone. It\u2019s comedic and contagious just like most of the conversational dialogues. Furthermore, the OP and ED songs are fluid with consistency and sets a fantasy show by example.\\n\\n\r\nHitsgui no Chika is a superior example of how a fantasy show should be portrayed as. Despite some general tropes we can see and draw similarity with, the show decorates itself with tolerable lighthearted comedy. Its small yet distinctive character cast sheds light with their development. And although some bits of the adaptation fails to cover every solid detail, it ultimately steers its direction with consistency in terms of its premise and story. All in all, this show is a great chunk of fantasy recreation with appreciable ideas. With season 2 in the horizon, it would be a shocking truth to not check it out.\\n",

            "content": "Chaika? Yes, Chaika. Chaika.\r\nCreated by the author of Scrapped Princess and Outbreak Company, this light novel adaptation is part of Studio Bone's trio of shows in the Spring 2014 season. Surprisingly, I felt that Hitsugi no Chaika was the strongest out of the three with its quirky and well-constructed elements in the storyline, characters and action department. These things help create one of the more memorable fantasy adventure anime in recent years.\r\nSet five year after a war, which resulted in the dismantlement of the Gaz Empire, the world is now in a peaceful state much to the detriment of Toru, a saboteur who is capableof performing the ironblood transformation. Without any meaningful civilian employment skills, he spends his days, along with his sister, Akari, rotting away and waiting for the end to come. One day, while foraging for food in the mountains, he comes across a 14 year old girl carrying a coffin on her back. Eventually, she hires Toru and his sister to aid her on a quest to gather the remains of her father, who is no less than Emperor Gaz himself. Along the way, they meet the various heroes who kept a piece of his body when they defeated five years prior. On the trail of Chaika's party, is the Kleeman Corporation, commanded by Knight Gillette, who is commissioned to keep the peace and capture her. There are plenty of other factions and characters that connect to Chaika in some sort of way and each one only adds the mystery surrounding her existence. \\n\\n\r\nHitsugi no Chaika's world is curious mixture of old school fantasy and early 20th century technology. The various devices that are shown reflect this odd mashup of aesthetics like the communication room working like a Skype call or laser cannons/barrier shields mounted on a flying fortress. Traditional fantasy elements like monsters and spells exist alongside with the more modern gundos and automobiles making the setting unique among its peers. Chaika assume that the audience is smart enough to figure out the mechanics by giving out just enough information and letting the viewer fill in the rest of the blanks. Things that are casually mentioned become the center of focus several episodes down the line, like the magical fuel powering all machines and spell-based weapons. This fuel, paralleled to our gasoline and diesel, is the key concept behind the core plot, economic system, and thematic overtones of this anime. Like grades of fuel at a gas station, the Emperor remains are all in a class of their own, which becomes very apparent in the later episodes. As such, all the locales visited are interwoven through this plot device making the background feel authentic and consistent. From a town's bustling marketplace to the subdued atmosphere of a mining to an ominously unsettling interior of a floating castle, this world begs to be further explored by the viewer. Just be mindful of the demonic unicorns, roving packs of lightning wolfs and the fog of despair.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that a good portion the current anime  is overrun with loli, Chaika is a breath of fresh air because she is not defined by fanservice or  pointless antics. In her profession as a badass wizard, she brings the hurt through her magical sniper rifle while lugging around a ginormous coffin. In addition, she is a skilled mechanic driver, and one of the few people in the show who can operate magical devices. Aside from wrecking people's days from afar, there is a certain charming side to Chaika that many viewers can't help but be entranced by it. While her casting skills are formidable, her attempts at cooking are just downright hilarious. By attempt, I mean that firing her magical rifle at uncooked food counts as such. Also unrefined is Chaika's speech pattern, which is filled with fragmented sentences and the subject of many GIFs floating around the internet. \\n\\n\r\nToru, when contrasted with Chaika, is far more serious in his demeanor and outlook on life. Trained as a saboteur from his childhood,  his life lacks meaning in peacetimes and it is only when Chaika employs him that his mindset begins to evolve. While not as memorable as Chaika, he does have his moments of fun and is far from a cardboard cutout of a character. Although, they have completely different backgrounds, they both complement each other well both on a combat and emotional level. Both of them cover each other's weakness in combat as Toru is a close-quarters specialist while Chaika is a ranged caster. In their downtime, Toru acts as a guide and mentor to a very naive Chaika and in return, she gives him hope for a future that doesn't just involve fighting.  Their relational development is very well-done as it felt natural to have this pair grow closer together on this journey. \\n\\n\r\nProviding a majority of the comic relief, Akari, non-blood related sister to Toru, is deeply and madly in love with  him. Incestuous vibes seems to be all the rage right now but Hitsugi no Chaika does it in an approach that is more akin to siblings bickering, rather than full on eroticism. Toru is very much aware and rather annoyed of her feelings towards him. Her suspicious timely interventions are done in a deadpan manner and is played out for laughs rather than being a detriment to the overall show. The last character, Fredrica, to join up with Chaika is most certainly the wildcard out of the entire party. Being a dragoon, which is the equivalent of a nuclear weapon in fantasy lore, tends to overshadow any foe quickly. She is not present all the time when fights do happen but make her presence very felt when she does decides to show up. Overall, I do think that she is a fun addition to the cast being the bloodthirsty loli, and is essential for saving the day when the plot calls for it.    \\n\\n\r\nThe team under Gillette tracking down Chaika is a odd assortment of former soldiers who had nowhere to turn after the war. As Gillette is a man who believes in justice and is an idealist, they are grateful to the knight for his compassion and share his in vision to keep the peace. Not much time is spent on them but I don't consider them to be the antagonists as they are quite justified in their reasoning for chasing her down. One particular member, Viivi Holopainen, is one-noted character being her infatuation with Gillette as the defining point. In a series that has a good amount of depth to the main characters, the supporting cast is a bit of a disappointment when compared to them. Many other characters are encountered along the way and they all have their own story to tell. Some you feel sorry for, others will make you want to see them on the receiving end of Chaika's rifle.\\n\\n\r\nEasily one of the highlights of Hitsugi no Chaika, the fights are expertly choreographed, fast and brutal. This is where teamwork, tactics, and sheer skill triumphs over any overpowering foe or magical contraption. It smartly avoids the shounen trap of yelling out attacks and having character reaction shots by giving the audience a straight up brawl. One of the few things that I value when it comes to character is competence and it shines through during the action sequences. Each person in Chaika's party knows exactly where to go and what to do to place their opponents into overlapping fields of fire. Traps, ranged weaponry, blades strikes and  are often used in combination and in quick succession for maximum efficiency. Same goes for the opposing force as their composition is also a mixture of different class types and employ ambush tactics, which makes for some very entertaining clashes. It's not just humans that our protagonists faces for the world of Hitsugi no Chaika is filled with monsters and other very unpleasant things. A demonic-looking unicorn that shows up in the opening minutes sets the tone for how ruthless this show can be when it comes to its creature design.  \\n\\n\r\nThe weakest part of the show is, by far, in its visual department. It comes in a distant third when compared to Bone's other offerings  like the attractive looking Captain Earth and Soul Eater Not!. The problem stems from the lack of all the fancy shading, reflective flair and light bloom that modern anime seems to be so fond of, making it look rather low budget and something that aired years ago. Thankfully, the motion is fluid enough during its more intense scenes and it's only a small blemish in a show. I want to give props to the Seikou Nagaoka (Strike Witches and Pretty Rhythm) for a solid accompanying soundtrack as orchestral tones fits in well with Chaika's adventure.  The opening and ending are no slouches either.  Both, being of the rock genre, are filled with dark imagery and gives off a unsettling feeling that Chaika is caught up in something far greater than her goal of giving her father a final funeral.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom the reading up on the previews, I wasn't quite of what Hitsugi no Chaika was all about. To my pleasant surprise, it became one of my top shows of the season with it charming characters, seamless world building and excellent fight scenes. My gripes with Chaika is primarily with its comparatively low animation budget and the slightly weaker characters on Team Gillette. If I could give Captain Earth's entire budget to Chaika, I would do so in a heartbeat.  However, these minor concerns should not deter viewers from diving into this show as they will be greatly rewarded through the one person that stands in the center of it all.\\n\\n\r\nChaika. \\n\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n",

            "content": "Really interesting and straight-forward title if I do say so myself.\r\nLet me start off by saying that I really liked Chaika -The Coffin Princess- It reminded me of a video game so much with it's action sequences. A JRPG to be more precise. The intense amount of action made me feel like picking up my controller (yes controller, JRPGS should only be played via console!) and mashing buttons! The story is pretty simple. I really like that Ichiro Sakaki didn't add unnescary and complicated details about certain events or characters. I like that everything naturally  builds upon from the foundation. Like first we're introducedto characters, then the story, next the back-story and so on, which is why I say it's straight-forward. I like seeing simplicity in shows with settings placed in older times because it makes it easier to follow.  Perhaps the only thing I didn't care for was the speech of Chaika(s). Her... their, speech pattern was so annoying and in addition to that, I honestly didn't care for Chika Anzai, role this time around. I like her in Sound Euphonium and a few other titles but honestly.. I just had too many mixed feelings. Lastly, going back to the story again, I would've liked to see more character development in terms of the main characters strength. The fights are great and all but I like to see new moves and special techniques that the characters learned and there wasn't any of that in Coffin Princess. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was great, for the most part. I wasn't too keen on the actual character designs because I felt like there were a few too many characters with the same \"gothic\" style. Battle scenes were pretty great. I liked the magic battles especially towards the ending of the season 1. Everything became a lot more intense in terms of drama and the animation quality really improves the mood.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was pretty unnoticeable for the most part. I mean during fights the background music wasn't really intense of dramatic enough to get me exciting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hitsugi no Chaika is a pretty fun and enjoyable title. Again, and I cannot stress this enough it's pretty straight-forward so character has goal, character somewhat carries out that goal and so on. Overall I gave this title an 8/10 because it is indeed pretty  remarkable! Great story, good and like-able characters, and lastly, pretty awesome battles!",

            "content": "Hitsugi no Chaika is easily classified as a standard issue, steam punk style fantasy adventure anime, but it possesses enough quality in production and story to make it something you don't feel guilty about watching. \r\nThe first thing that stood out to me about the series was that the battles were actually animated. No reused scenes of stock \u201cmoves\u201d or fading to a screen of flashing lines while the hero screams as an attack. People actually swing swords, move, duck, dodge, and maneuver. Amazing isn't it? The \u201cguns as magic\u201d aspect is a little boring, but it is what it is and doesn't take toomuch away from the otherwise enjoyable fight scenes. \\n\\n\r\nGetting an engaging story is the other difficulty in adventure anime. Series tend to get dry with repetitive themes, boring fetch quests, or stereotypical villains that must be put down. Hitsugi no Chaika manages to be more than this, by providing a convincing world for the characters to inhabit and giving them a unique threat to deal with, mysterious agents of a supposedly defeated mage emperor. It takes time for the plot to unfold, there are a few twists involved, and it gives the series enough time for you to possibly develop some affection for the characters involved.\\n\\n\r\nWe probably won't be talking about this series as a ground breaker or classic for the ages years from now, but it's a solid production I have no trouble suggesting to fans of fantasy and/or action anime.",

            "content": "With the obvious big shot of the season being No Game No Life, a lot of otherwise also decent and sometimes even better shows get pushed in the background, while I think some of these deserved a bit more attention. One of these titles would be Hitsugi no Chaika (Chaika, the Coffin Princess) by Bones.\r\nJust like many other titles every season, Hitsugi no Chaika falls under the category of light novel adaptations and it has many things which indicates this, such as the medieval setting with a magic system. But at some points this anime was a bit different from usual light novel adaptations. Forexample we have no teenagers as protagonists, but fully grown adults. Well, except for Chaika Trabant that is. But Toru and his half-sister Akari are both adults and saboteurs who were used in war. But since the war is over for a while now, Toru and his sister have nothing to do and are easily bored and hungry since they have no jobs. This especially affected the character of Toru as he is constantly looking for the meaning in his life in the beginning of the show, as he still sees himself as a soldier. But a soldier in a land without war and in peace is useless. Thus on an errand to gather some food for his sister and himself, Toru then proceeds to accidentally cross the patch of the awkwardly speaking, coffin carrying and confused looking Chaika Trabant in a nearby forest. After an encounter with a unicorn which gets defeated by the two, Chaika - who turns out to be a sorceress who is a bad ass with her magic rifle- asks Toru and his sister if they could accompany her on her journey. They agree and thus their story begins. I won\u2019t go into further detail because light spoiler territory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is rather mediocre and not that worth mentioning to be honest, but it has a few twists and turns along the way. The setting on the other hand is a nice mix of a medieval post-war world, mixed with some steampunk elements, which can be noticed especially at the clothing of some characters as well as some machines like various vehicles and guns. What really hurt the immersion of the experience for me was the severe lack of world-building and background information to the characters themselves. After the 12 episodes of the series\u2019 first cour we don't really know that much about Toru's or Akari's past, which I personally found a bit disappointing. The world itself, besides looking pretty, doesn't offer any lore or explanations to really get invested in like say Attack on Titan or for a better example the Toaru Majutsu series does. Magic and how it works doesn't even get hinted in the slightest, and we just have to take it how it is. While this saves some annoying info dumps and boring expositions, it also spoiled my enjoyment a little, as I always would have loved to know what was going on when a spell was casted, Toru activated his blood-iron transformation, you name it, thus making the story part easily the weakest point of the show for me.\\n\\n\r\nBut thankfully, though we have a really lovely cast of characters to help the show along the way. Let\u2019s start off with our main trio which consists of Toru, Akari and Chaika. Later on we get one additional side character that is rather a plot device than a real character on her own in my opinion. Like she\u2019s just there to clear an obstacle or help a few times in battle but doesn\u2019t do too much besides that. The main three on the other hand serve the plot very well; none of them were annoying or hurt the experience for me. And when some battles take place - which is not a rarity - the whole group got involved into the battles. No one really stood at the side lines and watched, no. They were all active which made the well animated action scenes all the more powerful. Also great to look at were some of the saboteur tactics and gears used by Toru and Akari during said fights. While we not always get explained how they are used, they are always there in the right time and are used practically to make the battles appear a bit more strategic and thought out. This was an aspect of the show I really liked in the beginning, but when we advanced after the first half of the show things started to slow down a bit. The action was still there but not in the dimensions like in the beginning. But thankfully the last two episodes speeded up again and gave me more of the exciting action I was hoping for The character development of the main characters wasn\u2019t anything outstanding but noticeable, so it was there.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other side of the spectrum we have Gillette-sama and his companions, trying to stop Toru, his sister and Chaika from completing their goal of spoilers. Gillette is a soldier and nobleman trying to fight for the sake of good because they and the high class people think Chaika and her new found friends are a threat to the peace of the land. Toru and his group actually appear like the bad guys for a change as they are confronted by Gillette as they are supposedly the trigger for another war. Unlike every other light novel main character would try to fight for there to not be war, Toru doesn't really care. Why? Because he's a soldier, a weapon, and a weapon without a use is useless in his eyes. These made for an interesting change in perspective in the early parts of the show and made this show stand out from the usual clich\u00e9s and tropes a bit. Unfortunately they didn't really do anything extraordinary or worth mentioning with this premise later on...\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters were all likeable in my opinion, especially Toru and Chaika really grew unto me and I even understood the \"villains\" as they got a surprisingly huge amount of screen time during the course of the 12 episodes. Story wise it came to a satisfying conclusion with a cliffhanger plus an announcement for a second season in October. Count me in.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visual and audio the show didn't really do much to me to be honest. Even though the colors were bright and the character designs rich it somewhat looked cartoony and lacked detail at some points, pretty disappointing for a show made by BONES. Thankfully during the fight scenes when it wants to look good, it does. The soundtrack was sadly barely noticeable and the Opening as well as the Ending song weren't that outstanding either, but fairly alright for my tastes. Otherwise the soundtrack ranged from average to slightly above average.\\n\\n\r\nSo, we finally get to the verdict. Should you watch Hitsugi no Chaika? Well, that depends. On its own it's by no means a  special anime in any particular way, so it may be just another time sink for about 5 hours for you. But if you're trying to catch up with the less bad stuff of spring 2014, I'd definitely recommend you to check this one out. It may not blow your mind but I do think the hours with this were well spent and even if you\u2019re just looking for a small action snack, this one should do you well.\\n\\n\r\nScoreboard:\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 5/10 (okay premise but it didn't do much with it, lack of world building was disappointing)\\n\r\nART: 6/10 (pretty colors and character designs but an often lack of detail, good action scenes)\\n\r\nSOUND: 5.5/10 (just slightly above average as the OP and ED songs were alright)\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 6/10 (likeable characters but a lot of background info to them was missing)\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10 (I had a good time with it, only after the 1st half it slowed a bit down)\\n\r\n----------------------------\\n\r\nOVERALL: 5.5/10 (Mediocre)",

The setting is generic has its presented in   aworld of magic with some kind of energy or \"mana\" (magic fuel) like in any other generic fantasy show.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nA very light novel-esque art, quite generic however the fight scenes were done really well, the character designs are somewhat Moe but it doesnt necessarly make the anime bad .. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and sound fit the show perfectly however not something to raise the bar at has it was quite average, the same goes for the background music and endings\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance you see the loli silver haired girl the obcessed sister and the generic guy possible love interest.. Further on the characters develop alot and turn into something more dynamic however has the show focus solely on the story it doesnt give much priority to the characters\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nHas i mentioned in the story section this show is very mysterious in its own special way, not many shows would be able to acomplish what HNC reached.. It will never be boring to watch  and the show has a particular diferent feeling from all fantasy generic anime out there.. I recommend to watch with Medium priority because a show like this is rather rare and of course its quite generic in other areas..\\n\\n\r\n7.80 out of 10",

            "content": "A standard JRPG story usually involves a group of heroes rising up to fight a large and evil empire. The group grows stronger as they journey across the world and find new allies and weapons along the way. Their final goal is to beat the evil boss, be it the powerful emperor or some supernatural force lurking in the shadows, to restore peace to the world. Their actions are glorious and heroic, and ultimately, their epilogues are ones of peace and happiness. \r\nIs life really so simple? Hitsugi no Chaika presents itself as the unofficial sequel to these stories, taking place a few years aftera large war that involved 8 heroes and an evil emperor. Its setting is relatively standard fantasy, with melee combat, diverse magic, and medieval architecture. Magic can be used for a multitude of purposes, from basic applications of light and heat, to combat applications of cutting and destroying, to general applications of powering vehicles, to advanced applications of mind-control and other shenanigans. However, mages are rare, and most magic is highly restrictive, requiring a source magic fuel and a magic application device in the form of a long gun. These mechanics make for some really interesting world-building and action, but thankfully, the show never dwells too much into explaining the mechanics, lest it fall into boring techno-babble and textbook info dump. \\n\\n\r\nEmerging from this post-war premise is our main protagonist, Toru, whose skills as a saboteur laid to waste as the world turned to peace. By chance, he runs into the other main protagonist, Chaika, who is a fairly competent mage, the daughter of the deceased Emperor Gaz, and one who seeks to gather the scattered remains of her father to give him a proper funeral. Here\u2019s the catch: her father\u2019s remains are strong sources of magic that were separately entrusted to each of the former eight heroes who defeated her father in the war. To gather the remains involves defeating all eight heroes and stopping everyone else who seeks those powerful remains for various reasons, among which includes the resurrection of the Gaz empire. As Toru, Chaika, Toru\u2019s sister Akari, and a sassy dragoon adventure around the world to achieve this goal, they are met with plenty of trouble from heroes, bandits, government agents, other ambitious adventurers, and various mystical beasts. \\n\\n\r\nAdventure has its fair shares of action and downtime, and the show makes great use of both. From the more passive moments of the story, the show maintains an effective balance between light comedy and serious business, sprinkling in healthy doses of witty quips and deadpan with meaningful backstory revelation and poignant character moments. I\u2019ll admit: even the more crude physical humor within the show cracked me up, and Fredrica\u2019s sense of play and trolling is a spectacle in itself. Within these lighthearted moments, amid Toru\u2019s sighs and Chaika\u2019s definitive expressions, is a sense of natural character chemistry forming between the characters. Trust becomes a foregone conclusion, and by the end of this season, it becomes obvious that the main group of four fight solely for each other, without concern of the views of righteousness or societal acceptance. \\n\\n\r\nThe action, animated by Studio Bones, is usual Bones quality. That is to say that the animation is consistently solid, and the choreography is excellent. From wired dagger maneuvering to dual wielding melee combat, the actions are swift, powerful, and clean, delivering both the visual splendor and the thrill of battle. The versatile magic makes fights interesting, as mages check the fighters with their range and utility (in crowd control), and there\u2019s always the steamroller dragoon Fredrica to consider as well. Fight scenes accompany the more plot-heavy moments of the show, and while the severity of the situation escalates through the course of the story, the action is kept suspenseful and thrilling throughout.\\n\\n\r\nOne pervading theme in Hitsugi no Chaika is the sense of purpose that motivates each character. What do the characters fight for? While taken for granted or simplified in various other action shows, Hitsugi no Chaika challenges this theme from multiple angles, all centered on the concept of loss. After all, Toru lost his reason to fight when the war ended. Saboteurs are not needed in a peaceful world. Fredrica lost her life partner, and Chaika lost much of her memory. Heroes in the war find their exceptional combat prowess to be meaningless in everyday life, and even commoners struggle with loss of purpose and the desire for something grander. These losses all occurred as a result of peace, and it puts to question the effects of war and the value of peace. Can everyone adjust to peaceful life after spending years on the battlefield? Is peace most desirable if people lose their reason to live as a result? Many turn to violence and power in desperation, while others waste away to nothingness. Even Toru\u2019s decision to help Chaika is highly questionable, as the emperor\u2019s remains can cause chaos and world instability if used by the wrong people. So what? Toru needs a purpose, and Chaika gives him one. Vague ideals of morality and justice cease to have meaning when one\u2019s own life seems worthless. \\n\\n\r\nCoupled with interesting mechanics, excellent action, effective humor, well-rounded characters, and a high-stakes conflict, Hitsugi no Chaika easily stands out as one of the my favorite fantasy adventures to come out in recent years. From personal enjoyment to critical appreciation, this show delivers, and makes me thirst for more. Thankfully, the wait won\u2019t be too long, as the second season is due in October. There\u2019s no such thing as too much Chaika, so please, more of this quality fantasy romp. And the dragoon.",

            "content": "Hitsugi no Chaika is based on a novel written by Sakaki Ichirou, whose \"Outbreak Company\" made \u200b\u200ba hit in the fall season last year. However, if you're expecting a moe comedy with big-chested kemomimis you will not find what you're looking for in Hitsugi no Chaika!\r\nThe story of Chaika and her coffin starts off with a BANG, we only get a few seconds to get to learn the protagonist Acura Tooru before the heroine makes her entrance with a bloodthirsty unicorn after her. Right here, the big adventure has already started.\r\nThe story follows Chaika, Tooru and his sister Akari with yet another companion on theirhunt for body parts. Yes, you heard me, body parts. These body parts happens to be leftovers from a late emperor, and of course these are very valuable and powerful. However, our lovable heroine's only wish is to gather >her father's< leftovers and bury him. Simple? Not by far. If you couldn't guess, Chaika is not the only one who wants these body parts. Yet, this is not all the story has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonists are a fun bunch of people with their own characteristics and personalities that make them fun in their own way. While Tooru's character is a very common one, it's hard not to like him in some way. The most interesting character is of course Chaika though, with her lovable innocence and incoherent way of speaking. She's pure as an iris, yet she's quite strong when it comes to magic. Akari is quite charming too, with her sarcastic tone and huge brother complex, but she's not anywhere close to Chaika.\\n\\n\r\nAlongside our heroes are yet another set of characters we get to know, giving us a chance to bond with the opposite side. I would not like to call them enemies, but they do want to put an end to Chaika's little journey. These are not evil people with fangs and big breasts, they are people who do what they think is right and they have their own problems they struggle with. \\n\r\nI was quite fond of this side of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses, more and more secrets surfaces, and the mysteries raves about our heads. It is when the story gets more and more complex and the main characters begin to realize that there's something they don't know, that it really starts to get interesting. The studio made a good job keeping the tension up, and no episode was particularly boring. However, some short arcs could have been made a little more interesting. Otherwise, the main story is really not bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design never ceases to fascinate me, Chaika is adorable and her dress is very creative and detailed. Some designs may seem a little weird, but they were definitely original and interesting to look at. It was nice that some of them were really colourful and really stands out from the environment.\\n\r\nThe animation is really nice, but since the animation quality has risen so much recently, it's hard to tell if it's that much better than many others. However, there weren't really anything that I found unpleasant, so I can't complain about it.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I loved was the beautiful backgrounds and the many colours we see in certain moments. They give a great impression of the fantasy world we're supposed to be in, and it hits me right in the heart. In one scene close to the end, I had to take several screenshots just because the artwork was so beautiful. \\n\r\nHowever, in \"unimportant\" scenes, the colours are pretty dull and not really that sparkling, so it has it's ups and downs.\\n\\n\r\nChaika's incoherent sentences was voiced by Anzai Chika, a name I had never heard about earlier. However, she did a great job and the voice fit perfectly. Most voices in HnK were unknown to me which was nice for once. Of course I have my favorites, but it's always nice to welcome new voices, and they were all talented and played their roles well.\\n\r\nThe music was fine, even though it was not the best I've heard this season, it's listenable. The opening theme is literally stabbing you in the chest with a sharp melody that fits the show's darker sides, and the ending follows the same theme but with a slightly softer voice. The opening and ending animation was quite nice and fitting, but I mostly skipped it since I couldn't wait to see what happened next.\\n\\n\r\nWith a charming heroine and a complex story, I give Hitsugi no Chaika an 8 for one of the best series in spring 2014.",

            "content": "Hitsugi no Chaika focuses on Chaika, the main character, who only has one meaning in her life that she knows of: to collect the remains of her dead father. If you're told you are nothing more than a tool involved in a larger plan, what would you do?\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story might strike you as that of a typical fantasy-adventure genre show, but it's not. It gives you a sense of mystery, as questions are left unanswered at first, to be answered later. The plot is not overly complicated and new ideas and plot twists are introduced not too suddenly. The one good thing is thatthere are perspectives from different sides. We don't just get to see a one-sided perspective from the main cast, but also views from other groups of characters, which was handled with enough care. The story might not be a masterpiece, but it certainly is enough to stand out from the large quantities of animes out there in some way. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art wasn't necessarily one of the strong points of the show because I've seen better styles, but was unique in it's own way. The animation was particularly good, because there weren't any particularly noticeable reused battle scenes. Since most battles each took place at different locations, in different environments, the animated scenes were mostly original each time. The character designs were alright, but nothing to make you fall for it, but not look away in disappointment either.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound played its role in this anime well. The opening and ending set the mood for the current episode and the next. The voices were fine, especially Chaika's voice, which conveyed her innocence, but also her determination. Akari's deeper and more mature voice added for a more diverse feel for the voices with a larger range.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nAs the story goes on, you'll not only find out more about Chaika, the main character, as she develops, but also about the side characters, as they develop. All the characters contribute to the plot and development of the main characters in some way, and aren't just there to keep the show populated. Some characters have are brimming with enough determination to keep you captivated in their goals. The Chaikas hold unique personalities even if known by the same name. The protagonist is somewhat stubborn and follows a code of honor along with her sister Akari, which is not overly stressed to the point it gets in the way of the plot. Akari has her fits of jealousy and adds some comic relief to the show, but in a enjoyable way. The main Chaika has an unbelievably strong will, despite her innocent and delicate stature. However, many characters have questions left unanswered, but there's a Second Season for that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nIt might just be me, because I like fantasy/supernatural genre animes, but I found this show captivating enough to keep me busy and continue with the show, as some episodes end in suspense. The show was fun at some points and serious at others. The \"fun\" part of it, wasn't relieved with fan service or simple jokes, but rather each moment felt natural with the story and wasn't a compilation of acts for the characters to act out on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall=8",

            "content": "Not too bad, it's a fairly interesting anime. I like most of the characters and it made a good job of keeping itself interesting. It's just that there's a lot of flaws, if it wasn't because of my enjoyment reaching a 7/10(not getting bored enough to lose my desire to keep on watching throughout the entire thing), I would've rated it 5/10 thanks to the many flaws and feeling of mediocrity in what could've been awesome if the author had done it right.\r\nThe world it's set in isn't bad and the settings of magic and its tools are pretty cool. The powers of the mcis also not bad, but it's a pity almost nothing is ever properly explained in terms of powers and how things work, it's shallow. The harmony between the mc team is fairly good and I especially liked the dragon girl, oh, no, the \"dragoon\" girl, gotta keep it \"unique\", right? (laugh)\\n\\n\r\nSo, well, I don't feel like explaining much more about what I like here, because honestly, there isn't that much, I just enjoyed the mood and developments to some extent, it had a relatively nice flow despite its shallowness and plot holes. Therefore, let's get on with some of the flaws that I noticed and which heavily impacted my score.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I can't say the characters are that realistic, even for a fantasy anime. Their motivations are weird and it often feels unreasonable. I also can't say I'm that fond of chaika unlike most other people, she's too innocent and \"pure\", by which I mean that she's quite honestly not cut out for this kind of anime. Her idiocy and quickness to believe anyone she meets and inability to be merciless and cruel turns me off completely. She's a liability, yet she gets her way because the mc can't say no properly. She's essentially going on a huge battle adventure where everyone's out to kill her, yet she keeps on with that stupid crap where she trusts people too easily and doesn't want to kill humans. Come on.\\n\\n\r\nThen we get to the mc, his sister and their powers. I am over and over again surprised at how they never actually seem to use their powers until it's way too late. It's obviously not that they can't, it's just that they decide not to and it ends with them getting defeated. As skilled and experienced warriors, they should know their own limitations and when to activate their powers, yet they don't and this happens so many times. Even if they need a few seconds to stand still and chant their little \"magic spell\" with their eyes closed, there are many times where they clearly had enough time for that and other times where they could've easily done so while being protected by their teammate or run away to do so. This can be quite frustrating when they get captured or defeated without fighting all-out. Well, it's even more annoying when they do power-up yet get f*cked in the a*s, excuse my language, by some random dude without power-ups, I mean, this guy trained since birth(well, since he could walk) and has all these special skills and even power-ups, yet he got easily owned by some guy that had no real training, at least nothing that could ever hope to come even close to the mc. That he's \"tired\" and that one of his arms had been stabbed just doesn't justify it, sorry, that's just not good excuses and it's just illogical and stupid, a cheap move to get more \"drama/suspense\"(which this series is extremely bad at in the first place). Well, sure, he turned the tables on the guy quickly with what was more of a low-blow than proper fighting(sacrificing an arm and pretending to be completely exhausted so that the guy let his guard down), I just don't feel like it was satisfying. Not asking for an OP mc, just one that can fight within the parameters he was assigned without getting weaker or stronger when the author wants him to.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I can't keep on writing, so let's finish up with the general setting. There are a lot of settings I don't agree with or like here. One thing is that you can turn memories into magic, it only feels stupid and unlikely.  There being a lot of chaikas and whatever else is really irritating as well, how can \"our\" chaika feel special if there's dozens people with the same role/appearance but different personalities out there? Hell, there isn't even any moving or good reason as to why they should gather the body parts, it's obvious from the very start they're just being used by someone and it's not hard at all to correctly guess who it is, it's way too obvious. The mc is just kinda bored so he decides to tag along while being with his brocon sister, that's the whole idea. Then they set out on a journey where their main opponents seems to be other chaikas and their teams, which is just boring, very boring. I can also tell you that the ending of this whole story was extremely bad as well, but that's not really season one so I won't go into detail.\\n\\n\r\nWell, so that's it. Kinda average anime, nothing much, but it's not a bad watch even so. The settings are uncomplicated and quite dull, there's lots of plot holes and the characters feel relatively shallow despite having their good parts as well. I just don't feel much spirit/zest here and the story is flawed at best, it's not a good thing when you honestly don't care enough about the characters to get affected when they, for example, get captured/mind controlled, when you don't even care if the villains to die or not even though they're obviously disgutsing human beings because you honestly don't really feel that much for the main characters. Giving it a 5/10 seems pretty reasonable, but I'm going to give it a 7/10 because that's what my enjoyment was overall, it managed to make me keep watching without feeling like it was too boring and stopping, and that seems to be the only important thing for everyone voting, otherwise there's no way the scores would ever be so high. Come on, almost every show is above 7/10 and so many votes you see rate it at 8, 9 or 10/10, there's just no way shows could deserve that if they didn't completely ignore whether it was truly a good, well-written story without flaws etc.",

But this show isnt what I thought it was. \r\nFor starters it is not something that will blow your mind, there are far better anime outhere. \r\nChaika, Coffin Princess is a light novel adaptation animated by Bones, and while the animation was nothing outstading, it had quality to it, it was vivid and colourfull.\r\nThe story focus on Chaika and her search for hers father's remains, to makehim a funeral... it may sound blant and void, but at first you dont even know this, as you wander who Chaika is and why does she want those remain...it even comes to a surprise to the other main cast, Tooru and Akari. Two sabouters, that choose to follow her with her's goals. Along the story they will confront enumerous enemies, and not everyone is bad or is fueled by evil intentions, some are actually kind and just people, ignorant of the real plot going by the sidelines. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and END had some nice sound to it, which I was glad for, since most of the times, anime OP and END came as boring and totally skipable. The END was really good, really emjoyed the whole vibe about it.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap it all, this anime can as a surprising gem, you may expect something different at first, and while throught the 12 episodes you may start to think this is going to be generic or boring, it never fully achieves it, the story can came as cliche at parts, but there is also some originality to it, and some surprises... and the cast was enjoyfull for the most part (Frederica, shut up with your fighting, you just want company!!). \\n\r\nWorth watching to kill time, good job Bones, definitly much better than Eureka Seven AO (last anime I have seen of them). Already watching second season, and it is a must if you found entertainment on the first season.\\n\r\n8.2",

            "content": "When you make a mystery oriented anime, an important thing to keep in mind when making an overarching plot is to never reveal the anime's mystery too quickly or the story will get boring, as well as never make the plot to convoluted or risk attention from the viewer.  But when you have a story that has to do with palette swapped girls in addition to a very peculiar overarching plot, well, now you've got something.  Hitsugi no Chaika, or, The Coffin Princess Chaika.\r\nStory (7.20/10):  In a postwar magical world, the land of the six allied nations is at peace, having haddealt with a big sort of world war that ended a few mere years ago.  The story follows our main protagonist Toru, a sort of mercenary for hired work known as a sabetour.  One day, he meets Chaika, a strange white haired carrying a coffin on her back whilst gathering food, (since he is poor, sort of).  After talking to her, he and his adopted sister Akari are hired by Chaika to gather the remains of her dead father scattered and held by all sorts of people, so that she may give him a proper burial.  \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is split into very apparent small arcs in its 12 episode time span.  Within every arc, we get basically the same thing, which is, a part of the dead emperor's remains, a little insight into the mystery of the whole anime, as well as a look into the after effects of the war and a bit of character development.  This for the series is rather formulaic, but, it works towards its favor.  This is due to the fact that every tidbit that we get is different depending on which part of the story you're in.  Personally, I like this, since the mystery of the anime is very clearly shown to the viewer, and it isn't obscured by a horrendous amount of other details and is actually rather straightforward.\\n\\n\r\nWhile i feel like the actual content of the story is fairly well done, one big gripe that was apparent to me from the very first episode is the show's pacing.  Mostly, pacing in anime is something I comment on and leave alone, but this show is quite different.  Many times in the series, the show has the same problem of rushing out details.  It's as if the creators wanted to make this somewhat slow intro to every arc, complete our main characters' goal, and then rush through the rest of the character detail or motives so that they can finish within the 23 minute time frame.  Personally, I find this quite unappealing because they just glaze over a lot of character details that in the end, we wouldn't really care about since the postwar drama story is more or less given to a character we will neither see nor hear from again.  (Except Fredirica, of course.)\\n\\n\r\nPrimarily, the pacing problem is very apparent in the first episode, since they do a lot of setting skips, putting our characters in one minute here, and another minute there.  (They kill a unicorn, eat lunch, get employed, and infiltrate a mansion all in the first episode.  If that's not rushed, I don't know what is.)  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story of Hitsugi no Chaika I feel was done well from a story perspective.  Details of the mystery were given at appropriate times, and the story was not completely spoiled.  Everything I felt made sense in some degree, and I was fairly intrigued by the story through the entire run of the anime.  On a negative side though, the pacing had something left to be desired, and the story was OBVIOUSLY incomplete with the ending of the series.  Like literally, it is a legitimate cliffhanger, and no one likes those.  (I will forgive this series slightly for the second season announcement at the end.)\\n\\n\r\nOVerview:\\n\r\n+  Good mystery\\n\r\n+  Easy to understand plot\\n\r\n-   Awful, uneven pacing\\n\r\n-   Cliffhanger ending.  (Seriously, anime studios.  NO ONE LIKES THESE.) \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.42/10):  In the anime world, character troupes have been beaten to near death as their overused characteristics are served to us every single season.  Thankfully, this series did not do anything of that sort, which, I am quite glad about.\\n\\n\r\nToru, our main protagonist is the aforementioned main character of the series.  As a sabetour, his main job is really whatever his employer tells him to do, which can range from killing people to not killing people.  As someone who was affected by the war, (mainly because he doesn't have a job now after not being a soldier of the war), he and his adopted sister Akari must try and make a living off of whatever they can really find.  I find him to be an interesting character due to the fact on how serious he takes his job.  He doesn't really have much of a moral compass, as he mostly views himself to be a tool to his master, told to do whatever he is ordered to do.  Calm in any situation with only the goal in mind, Toru is a character I found to be a pleasantly different main protagonist than ones in recent years.\\n\\n\r\nAkari is the other sabetour of the series, bearing a similar personality to her older adopted brother.  With the same sort of emotionless personality, Akari more or less does the same thing as Toru, following her master's orders, thinking of herself as a tool, and putting the goal in front of her own life.  Apart from that, she has a rather...obsessive personality with her adoptive brother, essentially cockblocking him in any situation with any other girl aside from her regardless of what the situation is.  Apart from that, Akari doesn't really have any other character traits.  She has a lot less character exploration than both Toru and Chaika, which is ok, but since she is a main character, I feel as though she should get at least a little bit of character development and backstory.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, we have Chaika, the character that is more or less the main focus of the show.  Chaika is a very interesting character for several reasons.  For one thing, her speech pattern.  Chaika speaks in a broken pattern where every \"sentence\" she speaks is spoken with only the important words said out loud, meaning that every conjunction, adjective, adverbs, and everything but the subject and predicate is missing.  From what we do see initially, Chaika is a somewhat naive character with a singular goal in mind, gather her father's remains.  For the majority of the series, that is what you see.  But, as the series goes on, her character both gets explored, as well as not getting deeper at all which sounds contradictory, but to me, is actually pretty interesting.  (Of course, elaborating further would be spoilers.)\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is split into two categories.  The first is the \"good guys\" featuring cavaliers and people who wish to maintain the peace of the country.  They don't get explored too much as characters, more or less playing the role of an \"opposing force\" to our main protagonists, but for being the characters they are they serve their role and some of them even get some \"development\" which I find to be interesting.  The other category of side character is the postwar group, the characters that are directly affected by the ending of the war.  For the most part, their characters are only really revolved around their war stories which is both a good thing, and a bad thing.  While they do get an interesting story to them that adds a little bit more flavor to this world that we're presented, you won't really remember their character names or appearances at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good main characters\\n\r\n+  Interesting supporting cast stories\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.08/10 and 7.31/10):  Hitsugi no Chaika was made by Studio Bones, a studio that is well known to do rather high quality work, and this show is no different.  Hitugi no Chaika is a very detailed looking show, from its backgrounds, to the magical circles, to the actual character look.  (Seriously, just look at Chaika's outfit.  That thing takes some time to draw.)  The show is more or less standard fare for the studio, but in terms of animation quality to other shows, Hitsugi no Chaika is very nice looking.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for the series was sort of...meh.  The opening for the series isn't really fantastic sounding in any way, but for some reason, it's a song that I can't get out of my head.  It has a very unique sound to it, but it never stood out as an extremely memorable tune.  (Though it is catchy.)  The ED is similar, in the sense that it has a very unique sound to it, whilst also being not as memorable as it could be.  It's not to discourage the series's songs in any way, as they are listenable and rather good, but they aren't the best things ever.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Very nice animation\\n\r\n+/-  Decent soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (7.41/10):  The first episode of this series really felt unfulfilling.  Nothing really was explained there and I was slightly boggled by what was going on due to the horrendous pacing.  But, as I continued watching, the initial thoughts I had of the series became more and more positive.  I was very intrigued by how the series was being played out due to the sort of plot twist as the series progressed.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like it?\\n\\n\r\nYes, I did.  This series had a very original idea story idea and never ceased to bore me.  I was always intrigued by what would happen next, and how the story would play out in addition to the intriguing characters that were playing a part in the series.  \\n\\n\r\nIs the anything I personally didn't like?\\n\\n\r\nYes, there is.  For one thing, I didn't like the way the show was paced, that was something that bugged me in this show.  Another thing was the sort of awkward \"romance\" that happened in the final episode because for me, it felt somewhat forced to put that sort of connection between two characters.  (Plus, Chaika is like 13 and Toru is 20.  Pedophilia anyone?)  Also, Chaika's eyebrows.  Enough said.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it to watch?\\n\\n\r\nIf you are interested in an anime that focuses on magic and an overarching mystery, then I would recommend you watch this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: (7.62/10)  Luckily, there's a second season, or this score would be lower.",

            "content": "So recently, a lot more light novels have been adapted to anime (as well as manga), to varying success (They didn't do it much before because of how poor the adaptations were, like Densetsu Yuusha). Most of them add a lot more fanservice than the originals, probably to give them some value in the case they turn it into complete garbage (ideal example of this is the second season of Infinite Stratos). Hitsugi no Chaika is another one of these adaptations, though it is quite different from its peers.\r\nStory: 9\r\nWhile it's nice that the synopsis doesn't really spoil anything, it doesn't actually tell you anythingeither. The premise (settings, backgrounds, and such) isn't particularly unique, but the story is interesting and not too cliched.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art is of a much older style than what is popular nowadays, and they didn't bother adding tons of fanservice either. Art of course is a personal preference, but older art styles can be nice, where they don't just go around making girls have stupidly shiny skin (as if they were gladiators that oiled themselves every day), and guys being stupidly angular.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe sound is fine; they didn't do anything spectacular, but it's fine. I really like the theme songs though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nWhile many light novel adaptations (mostly ones with high fanservice) would try to make the pace of the anime insanely slow, (with an episode exclusively about one character cooking, or something like that) and make several seasons of the same stuff with no development (allowing them to milk more $), Hitsugi no Chaika does the opposite and completely jumps the gun, skipping out on tons of detail, characterization, and somewhat importantly, explanation. All of the aforementioned are present in the novels, and the lack of can make this anime confusing, or make people unentertained, and pretty much not \"get\" things. (it's mostly character though). The anime adaptation is missing a LOT, and all I can say is that it could have been done better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nAs many may have noted, this anime is quite underrated. The truth is, people nowadays want and expect fanservice to go along WITH whatever it is they like to see in an anime; interesting plot, likeable characters, clever and entertaining dialogue etc. If there's a female character, they'd better make her show some skin, because that'll make people like it more, whether they realize it or not. I've no idea how well it's received in Japan, but for being different, Hitsugi no Chaika is most certainly lacking in love.",

            "content": "Well, that was an...average anime. Pretty much the definition of meh-ness, the meh-est of meh, so to say. Hitsugi no Chaika, or Chaika the coffin princess a first looked to me like a fairly typical adventure anime in the style of FMA or even Berserk without all the rape and robot arms, if you get what I'm saying. Just some colorful people on a journey with a magical objective. And that is what you get with this show, just not to the extend of the aforementioned shows. What's left is, at least after the first season, a pretty fun, at times boring and overall verygeneric kind of little show you will certainly forget about rather quickly. \\n\\n\r\nAt first though, let me talk about setting, characters and the like. The show is set in a fantastical world, filled with magic bullet spells and animals looking like somebody had to much time on their hands while having to design a unicorn for example. This left at least the creature of the first episode for example to be a bit overdesigned, but also interesting looking. When you played any of the Tales games, you will fell yourself at home here. That though is also one of my major gripes I have with this show. If you are in any way familiar with these kinds of shows, you will find the world of Chaika to be quite boring and uninteresting. Designs of the creatures gets even duller, as the show progresses, so there is that. No upwards trend there, I guess. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are for the most part nothing to write home about either. Toru is our standard anime protagonist for the day and does not have anything to him, worth writing about him here. Chaika herself seems to at least have an objective which makes her character a bit more thick layered, but her speaking quirk is the only mentionable thing about her in quite the same way. That leaves us with Akari, who has at least a bit of a character, even if she is all over the place in therms of consistency about her mood and such. She was the only character I was not indifferent to on the other hand, but that rather says something bad about the rest of the cast, than something good about her. The pseudo-anthagonist is generico-bad-but-really-just-honorable-boring-straight-guy bored me to bollocking tears and his party of sleeping pills was no different. The dragon I won't mention because the show did not mention even some personality about her either. Fair is fair. \\n\r\nAlso their names...ugh. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation was quite solid for the most part. Some hiccups here and there, nothing really special overall, but serviceable. Character designs, like I said are a bit overdone sometimes, in therms of clothing and all. Characters might have to be distinguishable from the crowd of background people, but this went overboard and came off looking quite silly. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the writing though, this show drops the ball almost completely in trying to invest me into the story. I got bored in the first third of the show and could not be bothered to be invested and thrilled right up until the final moments. They had one minor reveal, that could have potential, but nothing mind blowing or even something close to that. There was just so much potential lost and the concepts that were subject to the story were never that exiting or just too thinly spread across one or two episodes. \\n\\n\r\nNever using Gillette ever again though, I mean jeez...why even? Can't you think of any other names or is that a weird thing I don't know about again? You tell me.",

            "content": "Suprisingly good.\r\nAs a girl, the overdone harem vibe didn't do much for me and there were times in the beginning that I found Chaika annoying. The characters are not particularly deep, they are a bit like stereotypes, and some episodes seem to have no point or impact on the story. Despite all that, by the end I was reluctantly impressed. \r\nThe world-building was admirably done. It's taken the stereotype of a fantasy kingdom and inverted it. The princess carries a coffin and causes trouble, the unicorns are wild and dangerous beasts, and the system of magic is - like our modern fossil fuels - basedon powering the present with the remains of the dead. I also found it interesting that they've done away with the stereotype of all the regular people desiring peace and prosperity at any cost - these peasants desire war in a plausible and human way. \\n\\n\r\nThe princess's story arc is also remarkable. It's not the stereotype of an ordinary girl finding out she has a great destiny and learning to accept that responsibility, fight, and eventually rule. From the beginning there is no question that the princess has a special destiny. The question is whether it's a noble destiny, or a mission ordained by the devil. How will Chaika interpret her destiny, and what consequences will her actions have? because they may not all be positive. Like an dark alternative \"Scrapped Princess\" intended for a male audience we wonder about the princess's destiny. Is it to destroy the world or save it? But somehow the question of the ultimate outcome of the heroes' journey takes a back seat to the question \"What do they, what does the princess, intend to do?\" The hero in particular has no noble intentions, he acts nobly because he has a soft heart and a savior complex.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime to others? Sure. Do I think it's necessary or interesting to watch every episode? Not really, no.",

            "content": "Mod Edit: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nChaika The Coffin Princess Review:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nA top down mediocrity that is just as good as giving You heaps of junk food rather than a fine home-made cake.\r\nREVIEW:\r\nThe so called power known as \u201cMagic\u201d (yeah how original) can feel vaguely explained at times, like how the protagonist uses iron blood to make himself glow red and that apparently makes him stronger? Though this kind of vague explanation is probably left for the best since Mahouka made an awful job for itself...\r\nCharacters do seem badly directed, but for a show that exceeds in self-awareness it does seem quite flawed. To summarise: It's oneof those shows that You only gobble it for the action, though it is heavily action oriented especially sine the show constantly likes to make some stupid looking excuse just to see a flying castle firing death lasers on the capital city that is using Young girls as a fuel source because of some scientific magic stuff. It further emphasised this with other plot continence gibberish like how this Dragoon lady was clearly dead, but oh wait, she was resurrected because Dragoons are reborn as a chibi person when they die.\\n\\n\r\nTorou is a bare-bone generic main, if he was a tad serious with the whole duty being an overly devoted mercenary that has a back story that makes little sense of such motives a sister as his tsundare with some signs of incest and chaika, the ditsy moe girl that so many k-on tards infatuate themselves into. Yes, you can already tell this is not meant to be a serious show if the first few minutes was a loli using a magical sniper rifle to chop a unicorn in half and the whole thing about finding the missing body parts of her father to do a resurrection ritual is quite silly.\\n\\n\r\nIt had  moments when it loses consistency and tries to be serious, like how Torou shows he's devotion to Chaika as the Anime tried to make it look like a really serious scene, but on the flip side, the majority of what followed previously was nothing but a light hearted action show that Your meant to consume retardedly.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters do lack depth, development, personality since there all just  cookie cutter, and they do lack a feeling of a greatly executed character, You don't really feel anything with these guys and there motives feel more like an excuse to increase the body count. They never develop,  grow stronger or let nothing happen  to them at all which is not character development. I'm not saying its bad, it did achieve for what it was trying to do, but something like JoJo Crusaders which at least attempted on making characters feel self-aware in the environment, but in here, the cookie cutters don't feel justified to really be immersed in the world they live in, which therefore keeps a middle face. However, at this point, all what You ever wanted see is just the action alone and not anticipating old Joeseph spouting some of the best engrish ever.\\n\\n\r\nAt least Bones made a simple plot that You can understand, unlike some abomination like Darker Than Black, but for what its worth: Character designs are not very consistent, and many \u201cActual\u201d side characters are completely cheap. The colour scheme is rather bland, and just has all of Your typical greys, artificial like colourings and monster designs that are not meant to be taken seriously. Though the animation keeps a very consistent budget, and the action scenes look very crisp, cool, and You can tell there was effort put into making such scenes look as choreographicly sharp as it can be.\\n\\n\r\nOnly having 4 quality songs in the OST, and with that much money to be put on quality over quantity, it is a great sound track. It has this purely orchestral and classical like vibe to it. You listen to this sound track at Your own, and You feel such effort from each song as it shows very genuine emotion and heart. It uses a large variety of harps, pianos, violins, trumpets, drums and any orchestral instruments You can think of. Sure its tiny, but its not one that You would get so bored of so quickly...\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nI watch it, and all what I remember was people fighting each other for the silliest reasons, though it is self-aware, it does serve the job for You to eat some action like a bag of crisps. People look at this show, watch this show, and then forget it as another mediocrity. Season 2 You may ask? Its bound to be the same thing to continue the story line...

            "content": "My abridged review of *Chaika - The Coffin Princess,* a fun fantasy adventure from Studio Bones, the studio that brought us such classics as Fullmetal Alchemist and Cowboy Bebop: The Movie.\r\n*Plot: 6.7/10-* Chaika's plot is relatively simple, at least in the first season, and the beginning of the second.\r\nFor the first 14 episodes or so, it s a character driven story with the MacGuffin being the Emperor's remains. What makes this premise work is that story progresses because of the characters actions. On their journey, the characters encounter different parts of the world, and try to take back the Emperor's remains. Along the way, someplot twists are thrown in, which makes you question the original goal. Season two gets off to a strong as it unravels the mystery behind Chaika's origins and forgotten past. Unfortunately, by the halfway mark, the series shifts to a plot driven narrative as it charges towards the rushed finale. As far as rushed finales go, Chaika's is far from the worst, but its lack of focus on the characters is disappointing considering that the characters are the best aspect. Due to said ending, it really soured my initially positive opinion of the series. \\n\\n\r\n*Characterization: 8.0/10-* What makes The Coffin Princess so much fun are the characters. Chaika is an adorable young girl, who does not know why she must find her father's remains, but is nevertheless driven to give him a proper burial. She also talks in adorably broken Japanese, and she has an innocence about her that you cannot help but love. However, she is given enough character development to prevent her from being a moe-blob, and she is almost never used for fanservice.\\n\\n\r\n*Season 1: 8.0/10_Season 2: 7.3/110 = Overall: 7.7/10-* Ultimately, Chaika - The Coffin Princess is a tale of two seasons. Season one is a fun fantasy adventure with the type of lovable characters and fantasy adventure that is reminiscent of Bones' past work. On the other hand, season two is an unfortunately rushed conclusion to the story, even though it still contains a few of the highlights of the first season.",

            "content": "On a sublime outlook, anime that have been inspired from medieval, or let's say \"dark-age\" theme or plot has been more of an affection or a hype ever since SAO was broadcasted and went even more evident when Shingeki no Kyojin aired in 2013. Nowadays, we get more of them than we get quality and reasons worth the watch that even as I type this review, I don't want to be bothered looking at the list at livechart.me. True enough, I enjoyed Shingeki no Kyojin before it went cool. I moved on when the fandom shifted to Levi-X-Eren instead of what the magnum-quality of itsstory thought to have delivered. Not to worry, because fandom thought of that as \"cool\", and fandom dominate MAL.\\n\\n\r\nIt's now 2015 and we're still waiting for the SNK's next season, which I hope to watch before it went cool and farfetched-shipping happens. I'm bringing SNK to attention because people or otakus around seem to relate every dark-age-inspired anime from SNK. Which brings me to the thought that, as dark-age-inspired anime do come from all qualities and nature, SNK should NOT be the yardstick (or the basis) of it. That's like telling Porsche that the Panamera needs to drive like the 911 in every detail.\\n\\n\r\nSo here, I'll review one of the recent dark-age anime: Hitsugi no Chaika.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7\\n\r\nChaika: the Coffin Princess, is about a goth-loli princess with a coffin as a backpack, who's looking for her father's, the dead emperor's, mangled remains. Set in a world where magic is present and buy-able, she got assisted by saboteurs on her quest in a world that has surfaced from the 200 years war, with a supporting reason that saboteurs don't betray their employers (and that's a good plot device). And the world doesn't want to have another war trouble (where have I heard this before?), thus being the daughter of the man who started the debacle, is what you'd entirely expect to be the villain of it all. But no, as Chaika is the protagonist, then she's suited to be the antihero, but isn't. From here on you can follow how the story will look like, even if you haven't seen a single episode out of it. It's like watching an RPG, actually.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 7\\n\r\nChaika, Tooru, Akari, Fredrica (Dominica), at least they're about 3/5-star rating memorable. Chaika has the personality: her broken-Japanese, her overall good-nature, and being a ditzy-moe at times, all part of the plot-elements, but it worked good enough for the story not to be as ludicrous as it could have been. What's more, some characters are named after cars (and a plane manufacturer), so I'm guessing the creator did have some flair on them:\\n\r\n~TRABANT (Chaika) = a relic equivalent of the VW Beetle that was very useful on East Germany, only because there probably isn't any car around inside the Berlin Walls.\\n\r\n~ACURA (Tooru, Akari, Shin)  = the luxury division of Honda; it's like what Infiniti is to Nissan, and what Lexus is to Toyota.\\n\r\n~BOMBARDIER (Karen) = okay, this is not a car, but a plane manufacturer from Canada.\\n\r\n~LANCIA (Grad) = unless you're British, you really wouldn't know that the Brits claimed this car to be better and stylish than Ferrari.\\n\r\n~SKODA (Dominica) = Czech automobile manufacturer, good quality and good cars.\\n\r\n~KOENIGSEGG (empire) = a Swedish hypercar (high-performance car) manufacturer in which their products are really not my fancy, but I have a sheer respect to them, especially their Agera, which can rival the Bugatti Veyron.\\n\\n\r\nAt most, these kind of (car) trivia does contribute me to keep on watching HNChaika. It may or may not make your care, but it made me do a little bit of caring as what and how will the characters pressed on episode after episode.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART = 10\\n\r\nAs I've said on my Kimi ni Todoke review: \"When I watch anime, I'm not really particular about the art because being particular at it is like being particular at what box your mind wants to be comfortably snuggled in. But I never stay inside the box. Never.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 8\\n\r\nA bit on the aggressive-side of opening and ending songs, really dunno if that would work as there are a lot of compositions that are the same as these. Still, good tune all throughout.\\n\r\nAs for the seiyuus, yep, they've done a good job, Chiwa Saito is still on her edge as Dominica/Fredrica, and a newer seiyuu (Chika Anzai)is admired well as the voice of Chaika. Overall and for the rest of the seiyuus, they're good enough for their corresponding roles.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 7\\n\r\nThere are ups and downs, maybe the same feeling will linger if you've driven a 911 and sat immediately on a Panamera. Somehow, the enjoyment will grow on you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 7\\n\r\nI did enjoy it, but there are times I did not. There are plotholes, the author doesn't want to expand more of the characters' personalities--and that makes the characters a little-more extra nicer than they should have, a rifle that takes more time than MegaMan's X-Buster, and in hindsight, it's somewhat predictable on every episode's progress. Now, I can't tell you more of this because that's borderlining spoilers already. What I can say is it really isn't that sparking or involving to watch, and yet, getting to see Chaika's ordeals up to the season two's 10-rushed episodes, you just have that feeling inside that you want to cheer for her to go get those mangled remains and perform that proper burial, and hug her when the unveiling of events come.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT = A quite good dark-age themed anime with magic, broken-Japanese, and RPG-esque sequential shifts.",

And Akari a glorious imouto like no other. She's hilarious andbeautiful, although I hated it when she cockblocked Toru. \\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion Hitsugi No Chaika is a great watch, but be sure to watch it carefully (You'll understand when you finish it). It'll make you want more. \\n",

            "content": "The action genre may have been the genre that pulled in many anime fans, such as those long running shounen series that is widely known in the West. Growing up, those were the sort of things found on mediums like Toonami and introduced the medium of anime to the West. Being someone that falls into this category, I wasn't fond of the long running series, but always have a guilty pleasure of finding enjoyment in the action genre. I have been watching action/adventure series recently and stumbled across this which had a not so interesting premise but a promising first two episodes. Well this showcertainly left a mark on me, a deep wound filled with venom that gives me nightmares just thinking about. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is simple and its good that it is, anime series that expand upon the simple plot seem to do well. Chaika introduced a lot of plot points early and it seemed like it was going to have promising payout had it been handled correctly. Unfortunately for those who have watched it, no answers are given and frankly the new plotpoints brought up are just not interesting. Really, this is some of the most simplest, watered down type of writing which a 10 year old with imagination could come up with! So many plot points are shrouded in mystery and the writer had one job, to answer those in a fluid manner that doesn't detract from the overall plot yet we are given new things to think about. Closure of these ideas are critical in good story telling and if the reader of this review is looking for that, pass on Chaika.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are boring, stereotypical archetypes that we find in tons of anime, exception being the male main lead, Toru. He has actually has characterization to him and I've grown accustomed to seeing \"me vs the world\" kind of archetypes, so I don't mind his actions. However, the rest of the cast is reduced to satisfy anime tropes. The ditz, the childhood friend jealous, dense antagonist, blah blah. Full of lame characters with lame interactions, and also the females are reduced to sexual eye candy which isn't a problem itself but the show is not very subtle with it. Development is an issue as frankly it was non existent and they seem to be there just for the plot to move along. It is a poor excuse at moving the story along and seemed force. \\n\\n\r\nSound was...wait there were sounds? Probably was but my disatisfaction for everything else must've lowered my perception of other elements. OP/ED are ok, good animation for it I guess. Sound for the voices fit their archetypes and really brought the tropes to life. Not a fan.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was underwhelming to say the least, action anime should have action scenes. There was a lot of building up/setup for the fights and a lot of them ended up being a 30 second moving with commentary type of scene. In the end, resolved within seconds and not impressed. Also, what is up with the females eyes??? Who knew everyone would have mascara or eye liner w.e the fk it is above and below the eye? \\n\\n\r\nChaika is like waiting in line to get a video game at midnight and you just reached the door in the long line. People who have bought the game say there is only 10 copies left and you're the 11th person in line. Thats the feeling I get from watching this. Anticipation for plot points and the disappointment from not getting any answers. I am usually a fan of action/romance/adventure but this is just on a different level of poorly handled. Too much is left to be desired and while I haven't watched the 2nd season, I doubt any answers are in that as well. I stress the plot for the show because there are too many convenience factors within it. Characters were too meager and inconsistent for me to remember. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nand wassup with the romance being between a 14 and 20 year old. The brotha has a partner at the same age right next to him. SMH japan ur doing it wrong",

            "content": "What is Hitsugi no Chaika? It is another \"modern anime\" of course! It has plenty of cute anime girls with too much personality; and other edgy people. I can't say that it is bad, it has a pretty good character development. The story isn't anything special, but it is fine and pretty fair. It's about a cute girl wanting to gather her father's body remains with her comedic and edgy companions. The anime has a fair amount of comedy, though it is mostly about Chaika's (the main heroine) plot development. It keeps you going and wanting for more, the plot is predictable, a lot ofthe times generic, but it is not totally boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle in general felt really blunt, although really cute for some of the female character, it felt too forced and just \"too cute\" for others. The coloring also felt really simple. But in general it was fairly good. In my opinion the producer should have made a lot of the character more serious looking, since there was a fair amount of more mature content. The main guys were drawn too skinny and little again; I don't know what is the hype with characters like that these days, but ok. Toru's development was really good especially, at least I liked it. You get that he is not exactly what he seems.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was too much too, I imagined a lot of scenes with less of it and they seemed a lot better. Not every comedy scene should have goofy music. The background music during the fighting scenes wasn't anything new or unique either. Just typical for shounen. Why do so many anime force so much background music these day? Anyway, the opening and ending weren't really interesting either, again just typical for their genre.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nOverall, I rate it based on personal enjoyment. I would say it was good. The story can keep you going, and asking for more. Although its fairly predictable you still ask yourself \"What is going to happen next?\" sometimes. It's a really comfy anime and I recommend it to those who just want to sit, relax and watch a generic shounen with cute girls. \\n\\n\r\nBy the way, it was really not cool ripping off a certain character from fate/zero.",

            "content": "Well the synopsis sounded interesting so i added this to my show to watch in the spring, so i decided to watch it, and after the first episode i was pleaseantly suprised, i actualy thought this was going somewhere, and for awhile i kind of did, but later on i thought the story went downhill got repetitive, and somewhat annyoing, but after reading this review you should still give this a shot regardless.\r\nStory - The first episode you are introduced to three characters, chaika, toru, and akari. At first glance this seems like one of those cliche stories where a guy encounters a girl andhelps her out, but later on i thought i kind of went away from the cliche and was a little more original but not much, and we see throughout the anime the three's adventures and who they meet and what they encounter. I thought in the first few episodes the pacing and consistency was good, but then after that i felt there were some boring filler type epsidoes which they werent but felt like, and i felt the different adventure spots i guess felt kind of repetitive and boring, there were some good fights here and there though so it wasent that bad, and chaika's sentence structure after awhile might get annoying for some viewers, i myself didnt mind it that much. But the story here is somewhat cliche and nothing really new that jumped out to me, but i mean for some it might feel opposite of what i thought of the story. There were also many plot holes i felt like. They would bring  out a new character and just kind of throw them away the next episode and not get much development.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-  Nothing really here actually, akari is that sister that kind of will do anything for her brother with some kind of love into it also, and the brother has to clear misunderstandings sometimes, toru is a pretty laid back kind of guy but if he makes a contract with someone he will always follow through with the plan, then chaika is that airheaded kind of girl that doesnt know what a sentence is and has little vocabulary, but is a very nice and sweet kind of girl that most viewers will end up being in love with her. And there are many other side characters that just kind of get thrown away except for a few, and didnt have that much of an impact in the story. Also the evil blonde kid at the end of the story was just downright stupid and im glad he died, he was a masochist or something like that. Some decent development here and there from the characters, could of been better\\n\\n\r\nAnimations - Not a huge fan of the art style, but i didnt really mind it. Animations at times felt rugged and undetailed, but definitely was beautiful at times. Not much to say here, i guess some characters had the pink cheeks default set on at all times.\\n\\n\r\nSound - I did enjoy the op and ed fit the series pretty nice, osts had a nice mix of guitar and other instruments when the action battles were going on. Probably could of played songs more or had more variety though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Throw away all the bad things i said and not expect too much out of this and just watch it, it could be quite the enjoyable ride, i actually thoroughly enjoyed this anime throughout the series, i definitely liked chaika and how they made her, little romance here there with toru which was nice, also i had some nice laughs (and scares), this can be a very enjoyable series if you are not expecting it to be something amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - I would recommend this to anyone that likes the adventure and action scenarios, also has some comedy and romance, pretty decent anime this spring. The technical things of this anime werent the best for me, but just sitting back and relaxed and watching this defeinitely was fun and entertaining for me.",

            "content": "Did you ever enjoy RPG? You will most likely like this anime.\r\nI have no idea if there is an actual RPG based on the original content adapted by this anime, but the feeling is quite similar. The characters have classes (\"I am a saboteur\", \"He is a wizard\"). Saboteurs are fast and cunning, using knives and something like \"bloodlust\". The wizards are use gun-like devices to cast spells and they are slow, but powerful (they can miss though). There are traders that sells magic fuel (mana). If you played RPG all of this would sound quite familiar.\r\nUnfortunately, usually if anime feels like RPG is usuallynot a praise. A game could have very repetitive content (allowing grinding), and could get away with flat characters and little character development with forgettable characters, since the fun is the fact that the player has control and can decide what to do. However, in anime the character and the story are essential, as the viewer has no control. Chaka writers clearly realizes this and help the viewer to dig into a fantasy RPG-like world by keeping it closer to anime, than to a game. Aforementioned classes feels like professions. Exploring the character past explains their skills. And episodes are more focused on a story and development, than fighting.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe main disadvantage about the story is lack of premise. It just start from the first second of episode one. You still do not know what you are watching and the anime already acts like this is a normal world the viewer is familiar with. However, the way the story is told hooks right away, since it is clear that it does not only develops (explores the future), but also explores the present (tells the viewer about the world) and the past.\\n\r\nThe story is centered around the world of the former Gaz Empire, whose emperor (supposedly dictator) was defeated in a war, and since a few years there is a peace time. Chaika is the emperor's daughter on a quest to collect her father's remains in order to bury him. His remains, however, are a source of magic fuel (but more powerful), so the remains are desired by many. Chaika met with the jobless saboteur Tooru Acura by accident and recruit him and his sister to help her in her quest. With this rather simple premise, the anime spawns into an incredible adventure that explores the fantasy world.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI am bad at evaluating anime art. If you do not notice that it is bad, then it must be good. But if you notice that the art contains details you did not expect, then it is more than good. Not only the lighting effects are amazing, but the artists were careful in the details such as writing. A posters shows fantasy letters that follows the proper alignment of the latin phonetic, but are rather round (like hiragana). Invention of a new language is a welcoming detail showing you that the artists really did care about details.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI rarely download anime OST. Out of ~90 anime I have watched I have barely 18 songs from 6 anime. This anime OP and ED is the seventh one. In contrast, I cannot say anything about the background music, it just fits well. It is normal ambient music that enrich the atmosphere, without taking your attention from the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nNow this is where this anime makes it right. Other anime that have RPG feeling (like High School DxD and Kono Subarashii) fails in this part, making the anime feels repetitive. Chaika uses totally different approach, by not only allowing characters to have deep personalities, but also allow them to develop.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with Tooru, it really seems a nice to have a positive male lead in anime that has both resolve and skill, while still keeping it human-like. Anime tends to make positive male characters either too shy/dense, or too justice like (to the point they won't kill the bad guy even if that could cost other people's life). Tooru is not like that, he is both positive (he cares about his all the people in his party) and full of resolve (he is willing to kill directly, or start a war, rather than abandon his goal and party). He knows his skill, but he is not invincible. If the male leads in anime were more like this one, anime would have been way more accepted.\\n\\n\r\nThe Tooru's party consisting of Chaika (the female lead), his sister and later one more female character at first glance makes it feel like a Harem. However, besides a few out-of-place comments from his sister about Tooru, the anime focuses on the story. While one of the females falls of the male lead, creating a tiny bit of romance, the other female characters follow their own reasons, nothing to do with anything romantic. And that's less than 10% of the anime, allowing the viewer to really dive into the fantasy world instead of contemplating about human relations between male and female. With such a small focus on anything romantic, the anime explores other kind of relationships making it far more richer on human emotions.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, I cannot ignore the bad guys. Without a proper adversary causing grave problem for the entire world, this anime would describe a pretty boring quest. The bad guys are not only quite capable, but also they are not inherently bad, as (in just one episode) sufficient amount of their past is revealed partly justifying their actions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI would never thought I would enjoy an anime setup in an RPG-like world, but Chaika broke my negative expectations. Combining just a tiny amount of comedy, romance and drama, Hitshogu no Chaika is mainly a thrilling experience of a rather simple job gone really complicated.\\n\r\nSPOILER: With all being said, the last two episodes felt a little bit rushed. A main character is suddenly killed (but not really) without any tension building up, it is just like *hop* and she is dead. But then, *hop* actually she is not dead.\\n\r\nEven when rushed, the anime ends up with a nice conclusion, which includes something happy, something sad, and the fact that the adventure continues into the sequel (which I still did not watch as of writing of this review).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nIf you need some thrilling anime with nice characters into a fantasy world setup, watch Made in Abyss. But if you have already watched that and you are looking for a similar anime (although in a quite different fantasy world), I would definitely recommend Hitsugi no Chaika (Coffin's Chaika?).",

For everything that you find out, a few unknown variables pop up, continuously adding to the questions left unanswered. A lot of potential, just not enough.\r\nThe art is pretty crisp and nice, and I enjoy all the character designs and the semi steampunk/ old world vibe. Even some of the fight scenes are badass, flowing and intricate, though others are lacking and seem a bit slow. Thecharacters are all enjoyable, and I feel for them, but only on a surface level. I do enjoy that you get to see the search for the remains from different groups' perspectives. It mostly is Chaika, Toru, & company as the focus, but seeing the other groups interact gives me a sense of sympathy towards them; they are no longer just an adversary or an obstacle. They have their own missions, feelings, and intentions. \\n\r\nThe biggest issue I have is how much wasn't disclosed, and character personality/ development really just skimmed the surface. Entertaining, and I'm already almost finished with the second season, but I do wish it was more fleshed out. However, for an anime that flew completely under the radar, this does rather well. It just isn't an anime to remember, despite the general enjoyment.",

As long as there's a third wheel, nothin happening here.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nA former saboteur named Toru Acura runs into a strange girl with silver hair and purple eyes while hunting in the woods. Noticing the large coffin she carries around with her, he chases after the girl as she flees. This girl isnamed Chaika, who then hires Toru and his sister Akira to journey together an collect the missing pieces of her father.\\n\r\nThe storyline is fairly original and I think it's a fresh take on the whole \"magical princess who's also a sorceress falls in love with an adventurer guy\" thing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe character design is nice and there's plenty of nice colors. The animation is fluid and the movements are very realistic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music wasn't too noticeable all the time as the main focus is the action which really distracted me from the music.

There is a battle in every episode and plenty fight scenes to keep you entertained. There are its moments of light comedy, though, as well as a sense of mystery that shrouds each character. The romance is very light so there isn't much to indulge on if you're a romance fan.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is a good anime to watch if you have a few hours to kill.

            "content": "Hitsugi no Chaika or Chaika - The Coffin Princess may at first seem like your typical \"Action, Adventure, Romance\" but for those who are willing to stick through, it becomes a very intriguing tale about a group of characters on an adventure in quite an expansive world with many mysteries.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story of Hitsugi no Chaika at first feels like one of your typical adventure anime which arrive every season but while going through the series, the story is much more immersive and interesting than what you may think. The story also has many more dark elements than you may imagine but dwelling into thosegoes into spoiler territory. Overall, I feel as though the story is well paced regarding the adventures and development of the main three characters. Even though the plot is very simple, I feel as though the world of Hitsugi no Chaika in itself is quite interesting regarding its pasts and functioning and the show has done well into dwelling on these topics in the right amounts.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Hitsugi no Chaika was quite average and there honestly weren't any moments during the anime where the art was exceptionally good. But this doesn't mean that it was bad, more like the anime did its job and nothing more. The fight scenes were animated well enough to be deemed \"cool\" or \"awesome\". The character designs were average as well except for Chaika who I felt perfectly fit into her character design. The thing that dissapointed me the most was the design of the weapons which could have been more magical or cool since it was a fictional anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe sound tracks were above average but the reason for me to give sound such a high rating was the voice acting for the characters which I felt fit their roles and personalities perfectly especially Chaika whose form of speech was perfectly executed and was one of the most unique forms of speech I have ever seen in anime. \"DARAKENA\" the OP of the show was also very good and quite like your usual OP which stick in your head after a few listens.\\n\r\nThe ending \"Kairaku Genri\" also did its job but just not as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nOne of the strong points of the anime. Even though the main three characters Toru, Akari and Chaika had one of your typical anime personalities with Toru being the lazy but talented guy whose smart and good at the one thing he was made to do, fight.\\n\r\nAkari, the younger sister who is a bro-con but a strong female character in both body and mind throughout the series and the way she showed affection for her brother was quite unique but I was unhappy with her not getting as much screen time as the other two even though she was a main. And finally Chaika, the main female lead who is the innocent and happy type who is loyal and caring to her friends and even strangers but has huge resolve when needed to complete her objective or protect her friends. These characters are quite typical in anime but the studio did a remarkable job in making these typical characters at their best. But other than the main three characters, the other characters didn't really leave a mark on me as these did but I guess they were average.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, the show was very enjoyable leaving me wanting more after every episode with a few plot twists here and there and may not be as good for beginner anime viewers but will be a good watch for those who like adventure action anime with a decent plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nNow go and watch Hitsugi no Chaika my fellow anime lovers!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

You have real death, that isn't tasteless but keeps a measure of realism that doesn't throw you out of your suspension of disbelief. \r\nIt has characters that are confident, they don't analyze the situation and have a 5 minute internal dialogue with themselves.  They just act.  They have a set goal and they move forward.\r\nWhile that seems fairly logical, its a massive breath of fresh air for me.  It's hard to find something that doesn't make you say \"wait...wtf\" every episode.  If you don't find thatintriguing enough to jump in, i shall continue with the exposition.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story is about a girl who carries around a coffin for a very good and very interesting reason.  While it sounds like the typical loony premise of japanese animu, it certainly makes alot of sense when you find out why.  And they don't belabor the explanations, there is a very nice progression of mysterious elements along with a no nonsense approach to the story telling.  And at this point, even if the story were bad, it would tick all the proverbial boxes for me.  \\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the story is interesting and engages you right from the start.  It might not float everyone's boat, it might not be the most original idea, but as you well know yon animu frens, that is not what is most important. It's the execution, and I believe this show does that very well.  With only 13 eps and a crazy storyline, they don't waste time, it doesn't drag out, they get to the meat fast and often.  The content is extensive and well paced and even after the 13, there is the upcoming second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt was fantastic for me, clean lines, a slightly different approach to most of the more popular design ideas in anime.  So it kept up with the freshness of the story and its delivery.  If there was poor elements to the art, i must have been too engaged in the action, suspense, clever plot revelations and the comic relief of the two sibling characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe music didn't float my boat, i didn't find it particularly powerful or moving, but it got us through the intro and took us out just fine.  \\n\\n\r\nI think some of the characters could be called cliche, but i will certainly go to bat for a few of them.  Not because of their pure originality, but because of their depth and ability to question, reason and act upon circumstances.  Rare!!!  So without a doubt i found much to be liked in this show, and i hope you find something to be liked by my review.",

It mixes the action and the cute stuff really well. Good balance I think is what I mean. The plot is very unique atleast in my anime repitoire, i can't remember ever seeing a group of people try to find a scattered corpse to give someone a funeral. I'm also a huge sucker for the napoleonic european setting, so  that's why I gave the art a 10. The music I happen to really like, but I can100% see why people wouldn't like it. Sort of a soft-nightcore kind of sound that is really an acquired taste. The character progression is very linear and so far I haven't any complaints except for one of the side characters. It was Julia the theif princess girl. I think it's assumed that she did some deep thought in the jail cell (spoiler) and she didn't try to like rob chaika after that or something. MAYBE the book goes into details idk that could be cool to read though. Of course my enjoyment is 10 because it's super moe and cool blood and action scenes really really enjoying this show, cant wait to see what season 2 has in store",

With so much delight, I finished this series (up to the next season plus the OVA) for almost one whole day (started at around 10am? or afternoon) and finished the series around 7am the next day. Then the story went well as I was also looking forward on how they'd gather upChaika's father's remains. Overall, everything is really well appreciated!",

            "content": "Hitsugi no Chaika is... fine. When watching the show, I took note of positive and negative aspects of it. While the length of the positives is a small fraction of the length of the negatives, it was at least enjoyable enough to earn a 5. \r\nStory: 7\r\nI did actually enjoy the story. It's at least unusual, if not actually interesting. A seemingly immortal emperor dies after a 500 year reign, leaving behind a daughter who takes up a coffin and seeks to collect his remains for a funeral. It gets much more complicated than that, and not necessarily better, but that is at least aunique setup. Additionally, the execution is alright as well, though the reveal at the end of season 2 is predictable. Overall it's pretty good, nothing amazing but not bad. It really falls apart after this though.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art only really gets a 6 because I really like Chaika's character design, and some of the animals, vehicles, and characters look alright too. For the most part it's generic 2010s anime fare. Not gonna hurt your eyes but not especially memorable. The magic circles in particular are just the same thing basically every time.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nI'm generally not great at remembering voices or music but other than Chaika, all the voices aren't particularly memorable. One character in particular is especially bad though. Speaking of which:\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\r\nOf the four main characters, in descending order.\\n\\n\r\nChaika - she's actually a good character. Her initial motivation is relatable and somewhat innocent, she's adorable, and she goes through some character growth. She saves this category.\\n\\n\r\nFrederica - She's mostly the same from the end of her introduction episode until the end of the series. She's aloof, just wants to fight, I guess she gains some respect for the main characters but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nToru - yikes. This is our main character. He's a deadpan \"grew up as an assassin (or in this case, saboteur)\" type character. Unfortunately, his motivations don't make a lot of sense. He says he wants to fight and directly says he's willing to start a war just so he can fight, but this doesn't come through in his character at all. Every time he fights it's involuntary or due to circumstances. He doesn't seek out conflict, so why is that his motivation? Also at one point he says \"I keep telling you, a saboteur is his master's tool\" despite that being the first time he said that. On top of that, his main power is both boring and really edgy. He repeats this mantra about being steel and feeling no emotion and it makes him stronger and faster. The chant the kind of thing I would have thought was cool as a 12 year-old, but it just seems ridiculous now. In the third to last episode of the series, a character says \"you never change Toru\" and he's right. Unfortunately, Toru's not the worst character, and he actually shares his power with the worst one.\\n\\n\r\nAkari - Akari is the second worst anime character I've ever seen, though mercifully the worst isn't part of this series. Her voice singlehandedly lowered my score for the sound, which Chaika's voice had raised. She is Toru's adopted sister but they never act like siblings. I can't, off the top of my head, think of a scene where they look at each other. Toru has no emotion in his voice but Akari makes it seem like he does, considering how deadpan she seems all the time. Her personality fluctuates for no apparent reason, and it's impossible to tell if she likes her brother or hates him. She is explicitly attracted to him but never shows any emotion at all to confirm whether this is actually true. Unfortunately, she was also written to be extremely possessive of Toru, so whenever he looks at other girls she gets \"angry.\" In her introduction scene, she sees Toru eating with Chaika, takes a hammer, and smashes up the bar. Since she is Akari however, she does this with no emotion at all. Also, Toru is blamed for the destruction by patrons and bar staff alike. Her outfit is also ridiculous, she wears a tiny miniskirt despite being entirely combat-focused as a person. The way she treats Toru is actually unfair, like there's a scene where she can see his hallucinations as he's in a dreamlike state, and he's hallucinating a peaceful, happy life with Chaika. She calls this \"unforgivable.\" She also accuses him of having an insatiable libido every time he interacts with a girl. This is a flat out mischaracterization, and I have no idea why she is written this way. She's not even all that important to the plot, she's usually sidelined when something interesting is happening. In the final battle she fights mindless enemies. Akari, and the way people react to her stupid abusive behavior, is enough to dock this entire series at least 1 point, and she's the primary reason this section gets a 3. In another series, Frederica or Toru would be the worst, but Chaika has Akari. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nAs cute as Chaika is and as interesting as the story itself is, Akari [enraged rant removed] and the world itself contribute to the low enjoyment score. The world is boring and poorly explained. Five years ago, Emperor Arthur Gaz was defeated by eight heroes. No one apparently remembers the heroes, and all of history was shaped by Arthur Gaz, including the ridiculous, nonsensical magic system. The magic system involves saying a bunch of words in gibberish and using magical ammo, made by fossil fuels or memories, to cast magic, except when this isn't necessary. There is literally a moment in this series where Chaika remarks that they had to leave all her magical ammo behind, then uses magic. There are also scenes where people are shown just firing their magical weapons without an incantation because that scene didn't need it, whereas in other scenes using magic without an incantation is considered weird. It's also hard to tell where anything is in relation to anything else, though I do recognize that that is often hard to show in anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nHitsugi no Chaika isn't necessarily a bad series, and I didn't have trouble getting through it, but if something like Akari's awful character and [enraged rant removed], the stupid magic system, or the boring world get to you in the beginning, it's not going to get better.",

            "content": "This is a spoiler free review aimed at those contemplating whether or not to watch this anime.\r\nHitsugi no Chaika is a very enjoyable fantasy action anime with a great element of mystery in the plot. Whilst not revolutionary and having some weaker aspects, it is sure to please those who go into it with the right mindset. Although I must stress that under no circumstances should you watch the dub. Our main character has quite an annoying speech thing going on (you'll see what I mean when you watch the first episode) which is okay (but not great) in the sub, but is absolutely unbearablein the dub. You have been warned. Okay, here we go!\\n\\n\r\n[Story]\\n\\n\r\nI very much enjoyed the journey of this anime. It has an interesting premise, and develops regularly with certain plot twists and great pacing. The only down side to the story is that it is very straightforward, and most of the plot twists you can see coming from a mile away. It also is not a revolutionary by anime means, meaning it is likely to be scored more harshly for a certain lack of originality. Having said that, it did have quite a few unique and interesting elements that for me made it unique enough to be very enjoyable. It also gets my extra marks for coming to a definite and satisfying conclusion at the end of the second season. \\n\\n\r\n[Art]\\n\\n\r\nIt was strong in some areas, and weaker in others. The action and magic scenes I thought were well done, but there did seem to be a wild variation in quality at times. Overall it was quite good, but not outstanding.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was fitting but not memorable. The opening and closing songs were good but not great, the sound design and soundtrack didn't stand out to me and was not particularly moving. Having said that, there was nothing wrong with it.\\n\\n\r\n[Character]\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed almost all the characters, although it kind of goes without saying that the speech of Chaika is pretty annoying and pointless. Definitely watch the sub as it is much better than the dub (I watched a few minutes of the dub and couldn't stand it before switching to the sub). There was good variety and depth to the characters of this anime, all unfolding as we go. The development and depth wasn't as good as some of the more outstanding fantasy anime, but I would rate above average in its genre.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment/Overall]\\n\\n\r\nI very much enjoyed this series. I feel it is slightly underrated, mostly because there isn't anything in this anime that hasn't been done before and better by other shows. Shows like this tend to get rated harshly for this fact. However there is enough unique elements and intrigue to this anime that will guarantee it doesn't feel like a rip off of anything else.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for an adventurous and perilous journey, watch this anime. If you are looking for something revolutionary and deep, perhaps look elsewhere.",

            "content": "Hitsugi no Chaika is about a group of adventurers on a quest to collect various relics.  Though somewhat straightforward, there are plenty of twists and turns to keep the audience guessing.  Rather than infodumping all sorts of information, the show informs the audience about the setting organically, while leaving enough mystery to create a sense of exploration as the story unfolds.  The tone of the setting is reminiscent of old Dungeons and Dragons adventures, where a diverse group of heroes set out on a grand quest.  Unlike similar shows though, the line between heroes and villains are a bit more blurredthan you might expect.\\n\\n\r\nArt is fairly good overall. Some of the character designs might be odd at first, but adjusting to them doesn't take long.  Fight scenes are choreographed wonderfully, and the fights themselves involve degrees of tactics and team synergy that are fairly uncommon in anime.  Compared to Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, the visuals are definitely a step up in every department.\\n\\n\r\nI can't recall anything about the sound, which most likely means there was nothing to complain about.  I found the OP grating, but that may just be a personal preference.  The ED isn't bad though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter motivations are a bit simplistic, but most characters have a reasonable justification for that, so it works out.  The personalities are fairly fresh and most characters avoid neatly falling into obvious archetypes.  The siblings play off each other in an enjoyable way, and their pragmatism is refreshing when compared to the constantly optimistic protagonists we commonly see.  So while each character might not seem terribly deep on their own, they fit the story well and work together to become a cohesive and interesting whole.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this is a very good show for fans of fantasy, especially those who enjoy their protagonists a bit more Lawful Neutral than Lawful Good.  Though I went in with reservations, I ultimately found the setting compelling and the characters enjoyable.",

A pair of saboteurs with a renewed interest in life because they have found someone to work for. A quest that is filed with twists and turns, and tons of different sets of characters each trying to accomplish their own mission. By the end of the 1st season, several plot points have been developed and the semi cliff hanger ending makes me excited for the nextseason. Unlike several other anime that have been cancelled, this got a second season so the slow playing of several plot points actually enhances the experience. There is a fair amount going on but it is easy to understand and fairly straight forward, making it far more appealing to me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe artwork is well done. I like the character models and Chaika is very cute. There is a descent mix between very bright and dark colors giving it a good overall mix.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound track is solid. It enhances the emotional and chaotic moments in a nice way. The OST is pretty solid and I added the opening theme to my anime playlist after hearing about 30 seconds of it, which is rare for me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is where the anime really shines. You get a solid buildup of each of the main characters, along with only a slight build up of other characters which will likely play a more prominent role in the second season. There is a complex issue being dealt with (I won't go into spoiler territory) but seeing how each of the main characters handles their \"mission\" is interesting. Even some of the evil characters had nice moments and their motivations were understood even if they didn't necessarily get redemption.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nIt is rare for me to binge watch an entire season of an anime without a break. This anime is something special, as it captures you right from the 1st episode and constantly feels like it is building to something exciting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThere isn't much more you could want out of this anime. It has interesting concepts, comedy mixed in with serious moments, solid music and art and has enough likable and relatable characters to keep you interested all the way into the 2nd season!",

Toru agree?\r\nOkayyyy I'll stop...in summary before I go into sections: pretty linear storyline, typical party adventure, pretty dark themes towards end, little hype but not bad.\r\nStory: As I said, very linear. We follow one group, which grows in number as typical in travelling adventures like Inuyasha etc. Bit of side interest with the generals in the Kleeman agency and Six Nations treaty. Searching for parts of a puzzle (in this case a body!) pretty typical...\r\nArt: Not bad, obvious black outlines everywhere on characters and horribly animated dragoon (in 2D apparently not that I noticed). A cool looking unicorn episode 1though and animation was smooth in general.\\n\\n\r\nSound + Character: Opening by hummingbird from Deadman wonderland- coolfact, but is kinda okay, better than a lot in it's season (not rising hope though!). Actually really enjoyed the classical bground music. Ending theme okay not bad either. Voiceover for Chaika was kinda funny :P thought she was well portrayed, her personality made me laugh at times getting annoyed at Toru!\\n",

What I've gotten was \"Scrapped Princess\" with \"Little Miss Gungrave\" featuring a \"Claymore.\"\r\nThe show, in order to reach out to the useless otaku-base, tries to make the token male lead, Toru, into another one of those useless and crapped upon self-inserts. But, with him being a former soldier and demolitions ninja, that's kinda hard to do. Akari's incest-dar is strong in her,despite being stronger than him and having \"booty for days.\" Chaika's just cute and a creation of memes, even though she's the \"daughter of the demon lord.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the few shows I like where there's no character I truly hate (unlike the lot of other animu titles currently being made). The art IS a little on the messy side and there are no upskirt panty shots, though.",

            "content": "The story is about how the daughter(s) of an Emperor who is considered vile by the humans search far and wide in the fictitious world for his remains in order to perform a genuine funeral for him so that his soul can reside in peace in the afterlife. At first, when I saw the word \u201cPrincess\u201d in the anime, I thought that it might turn out to be an out and out kingdom-ish anime which I am not good with and when I saw the genres and themes, there were magic and fantasy involved. On one side of my mind I thought that this mightnot be worth watching and will end up wasting my time as I am not that good with putting up with magic and fantasy themes. On the other side, few weeks into the Spring \u201914, I saw memes of Chaika and her freakishly thick but cute eyebrows making waves for all possible reasons and BONES were animating it. So I made up my mind to watch this anime once it ended.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor a 12-episode anime, the storyline and the plot might feel satisfactory at first glance but for me it was anything but satisfactory as the sudden surge in the pace of the anime at the last few episodes felt disappointing. There was this mini-arc at the end where Chaika Travant, who is endowed with long silver hair and purple marble eyes (typical to an anime character) and her thick eyebrows that exceeded the thickness of her eyelids when her eyes were closed along with her saboteur companions Tohru Acura, the male protagonist with a weird hairdo at the forehead and his not blood related hot younger sister with whom he grew up together in their village Acura, Akari Acura, adorning a long emerald green hair who is madly infatuated with Tohru and loves him the most; enter into this particular kingdom hoping to collect more of her father\u2019s remains. The story suddenly picked up its pace abnormally and the ending was rushed with very little explanations given. There was this episode where the Chaika legion come face to face with the self-proclaimed Neo Gaz army/faction which seemed to be a filler episode. That could have been neglected with more attention provided to the main plot. I do realize that it is very tough to stuff all the necessary elements into a 12-episode anime which completely makes sense but still, they could have thought up to make the ending somewhat different.\\n\\n\\n\r\nComing in to the animation, BONES did their homework mightily well especially with those magic circles and incantation circles that was a visual treat. The one that stood out the most was the action sequences. The hand to hand combat that were encountered mostly by Tohru and Akari were put forth really well and seemed realistic considering how magic played a major role in this anime. Action and fighting were in abundance and so was the enjoyment derived out while watching the fights. The only disappointment was how prematurely the fights between our protagonists and their adversaries ended prematurely either owing to the quick ending of the fights and smoke bombs with  our heroes triumphing most of the times or how there were barging of noses by external agencies. In one particular episode, Zuita\u2019s two eyes were facing in opposite directions which might be considered as a glitch in the animation that normally occurs and can be neglected without second thought. All In all, the animation was very good which accentuated the plot and provided some gripping moments through and through.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music was scored by Seikou Nagaoka, who is unfamiliar to me, but he did a pretty good job. The music played during battles was exhilarating and was nice to listen to. There is nothing better than a good music to complement a battle and the anime remained faithful to it. The opening theme is DARAKENA, performed by Iori Nomizu, who is the CV of Vivi from this anime, suited magnificently to the main theme of the anime and the visuals provided in both the opening and the ending was suitably crafted to perfection. The opening was good, the ending was satisfactory and the OSTs were great. Nothing more to be told. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are volumes to speak about how diverse the voice- crew for this anime was. Let me start with how catchy and cute Chaika Travant\u2019s split Japanese was and how godly Fredrika\u2019s seiyuu is. Chaika who is voiced by Chika Anzai could not form up proper words to finish the sentences. Instead she speaks with split Japanese which provides cuteness to her personality but at the same time, as the episodes wind down, this form of speech can produce traces of annoyance among us. Akari\u2019s seiyuu who I believe is a new entrant, has this deep voice which suits her personality with ease. Then there is Yoshimasa Hosoya (CV of Arata Wataya, Junpei Hyuuga) who voices the character of Alveric Gillette. We all know how capable Yoshimasa is. Finally, Fredrika\u2019s voice, who joins the Chaika legion around the 4th episode, undoubtedly provides inexplicably mammoth gallons of eargasms. Fredrika is voiced by the veteran Chiwa Saito (CV of Aida Riko from KnB), who happens to be my favorite female voice-actor. In the anime Fredrika takes many forms such as a matured, beautiful woman; a beast named dragoon that is as tall as a 3-storey apartment, a young girl and finally a chibi version of that young girl which you may or may not call as loli. In other words, Saito-san had to vary her voices according to all the four characters while portraying all the emotions of them respectively. She seemed to achieve this with considerable ease although it is evident that the voice for the dragoon might have been synthesized. The amount with which she had to vary her voice was innumerable and was always succulent to listen to. Out of the 4 personalities that she had to voice, my favorite one is that of the young girl who is of the same age of Chaika in appearance. Fredrika has a very vital role to play in the latter stages of the anime. I apologize for this huge paragraph regarding the voice-crew as I could not control myself when it comes to Chiwa Saito-san. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nHitsugi no Chaika might not be an anime that satisfies everybody who like fantasy and magic and it might not be an anime that people who keep away from magical shows will watch. Although there is an involvement of sufficient amount of magic and spells, the action scenes negate the magic so that a balance is provided. If you are more inclined to the voice-crew side of the anime rather than the plot then this anime is crafted definitely for you. Beautiful voice-acting with correct portrayal of emotions and joyfulness is always at most times a good sign that the anime is not a horrible one.  Many say that this anime is underrated but in my honest opinion it is definitely not. Just because it was overshadowed by No Game No Life and other anime, it does not become underrated.\\n\\n\r\nMy rating would be 7/10 if I consider all the factors and elements that make up an anime. Since I pay special attention to the voice-crew for almost every anime, I would rate this show 8/10 if I am inclined to the side where the performance of the voice-crew interests me instead of the main story and plot. \\n\\n\r\nPS: Hitsugi no Chaika is getting a sequel which is slated for release in Fall 2014. This anime deserves a season 2 as many aspects of the story were left unattended and not explained properly. Also, will try to rectify any mistakes that I made while typing this review.  \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The characters and story feel generic and bland but if you can get past the first episode, things get pretty interesting. Hitsugi no Chaika has a solid theme and is backed by a firm plot. The writers were definitely laser focused and were determined to get their message across. There are a lot of comedic reliefs across the story that felt appropriate and naturally in place. The anime has a good amount of foreshadowing. While a lot of the story is predictable, you will not want to ignore small details which eventually lead to problems or solutions. You may find yourself going back to previousepisodes and asking yourself why you didn\u2019t pay attention to those components. The world in Hitsugi no Chaika is quite large but the story spends time going over each town\u2019s unique features and histories which makes the plot feel different every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are special and we get to analyze their past and figure out how they ended up in those situations. The anime constantly keeps you predicting and guessing which makes it engaging and enjoyable. Fight scenes are concise and a majority of them last less than a quarter of an episode. Characters actually start running out of breath and get tired quickly after a few engagement which makes fights realistic. While fights are not that extravagant, people will use strategies and we wonder will they work. Most weapons are standard but occasionally there are some interesting ones that make them unique and unforgettable. Even though there is a fair amount of character development, at the time I was watching the series, I did not feel any strong attachments to the characters. During fights, I did not cheer for anyone and when there is a death I did not feel much. They are interesting (in fact some minor characters are more interesting than main characters), but they seem to lack the reason to be likeable. This is probably because there are still crucial information missing from them so they feel foreign me. But I have to admit, after finishing this series and thinking about them some time, I may now have one to two likeable characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are mediocre. The early parts of the opening are a little catchy but overall, music is not very special. Art is great but a lot of characters have similar looks, especially the hairstyles. However, their clothings are unique and reflect on the characters\u2019 background. The series is dark because a lot of the story takes place at night or inside a room so you may end up adjusting your screen\u2019s brightness a lot of times. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is vast and ambitious so 12 episodes is definitely not sufficient. A lot of questions are answered but some are not answered yet and will solve the mysteries of the story. A season two has already been released and I am excited to know what does answers are, how the writers will deepen the story, and hopefully make the characters more attachable. \\n",

            "content": "It's been said that the worst thing you can be is average. And that sums up Hitsugi no Chaika pretty damn well.\r\nHitsugi no Chaika (or \"Chaika -The Coffin Princess-\") aired from April 10, 2014 to June 26, 2014 and was based on the titular novel from 2010. It stars Chaika Trabant, a young wizard who carries around a coffin; Tooru Acura, a saboteur and former soldier; and Akari Acura, Tooru's adopted sister. The story is more or less a big McGuffin quest to find the remnants of Emperor Gaz. That's really all there is to say about Chaika because that's all that's even notable aboutthe show. Hitsugi no Chaika is one of the most painfully average shows I have even seen. It starts average, ends average, and never rises above the middle ground. It does just as many things right as it does wrong. \\n\\n\r\nStory: [5/10]\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the story is average. It is, as I said, a big McGuffin quest involving the remains of the deceased Emperor Gaz. It's difficult to even say more than that because the story and writing are so bare-bones that there's basically nothing left for me to talk about. The biggest problem here is the tone. The tone of Hitsugi no Chaika is pretty much boring. This is one of the most tone-deaf shows I have ever watched. It is played completely straight with light-hearted moments sprinkled in, but at the same time there are several moments of heavy violence and gore. This is a huge problem when it comes to tone. Chaika swings back and forth from light-hearted to flat to dark at the drop of a hat. The show doesn't really seem to know what it is or what it wants to be, and the outcome of this is a show that lacks any real identity. It does not feel like a naturally progressing plot; it feels more like a semi-related string of events. It's like a box of candy. You open it up, and from start to finish what you expected is exactly what you get. And when you get to the bottom of the box, you eat the last piece of candy and soon forget you even consumed it at all. That's what Chaika is like. It is a series of incidents that start and end; with no build-up, no clever twists, and no climax. Generally speaking, if your audience is having thoughts such as \"wait, that was supposed to be the climax?\" or \"it's already ending?\", you probably didn't pace your story very well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: [5/10]\\n\\n\r\nAs for art and animation, it is average. All the character designs are completely average, and for good measure they went ahead and used the \"only main/supporting characters and villains get unique hair\" trope, which of course means that you know exactly who you should pay attention to and who will contribute little to the story. Once more, another element that makes the show very predictable and uninteresting. The animation is nothing special. There are moments where it is pretty good, and many moments of incredibly laziness. \\n\\n\r\nSound: [5/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and music is average. The sound design is middle of the road as well, as there is an even mix of good sound effects and bad sound effects. The music is...does anyone even remember the music? I can only remember the opening theme. I don't remember a single track from the score that stuck out as memorable. Overall, a forgettable effort from the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: [5/10]\\n\\n\r\nAnd as you could probably guess, the characters are average as well. Outside of Chaika, there are no memorable characters whatsoever. Akari and Tooru are horrifically boring and monotone, and not once did I really give a crap about what happened to them. All of the villains are terrible and cliche, with no effort put in to subvert your expectations. All of the supporting characters are uninteresting as well, with the possible exception of Fredrica. To be honest, Chaika is really the only thing that keeps this show afloat. Answer me this: if Chaika was absent, what would be left? There would be absolutely nothing for the audience to latch on to. Her cuteness and bubbly personality is the only source of life and personality in the entire show. If it were not for her, I honestly think this show would be completely unwatchable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: [4/10]\\n\\n\r\nI was bored out of my mind for most of Chaika. The characters were bland and uninteresting, the story was too predictable and tonally inconsistent, the art was uninspired, and the music was completely forgettable. It would be a miracle if I remembered anything from this show 6 months from now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: [5/10]\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's Hitsugi no Chaika. There is nothing remarkable or noteworthy in this show aside from Chaika herself. If you like middle of the road action/adventure fantasy shows, then I suppose I could recommend it. Outside of that, there's no real reason you couldn't just pass on this one.",

Even though the story is nothing special it keeps you from getting bored and later on you will find your self trying to solve the mistery around Chaika.\\n\r\nThe plot is one of the leading parts of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the story we don\u2019t see much character development , but that changes as we go through the episodes. Little by little we get to know the characters past by various flashbacks. Later on we get interesting development of Chaika because of certain circumstances but I wont spoil that. \\n\r\nAll the characters are entertaining especially Chaika with her cute style of speaking. The main character has guts and is ready to take life in order to accomplish his goals often using underhanded means to do so.\\n\r\nTooru is serious and can give nice advices to Chaika when he needs to. He respects Chaikas wishes and will do anything to fulfill them. He was trained since childhood resulting in his speed and strength and ability to make quick decisions.\\n\r\nAkari is the younger sister of Tooru. She gets angry at Tooru and hits him when something annoys her.She often makes assumptions about Toorus so called lustfull side and does anything to stop him from commiting wicked deeds on Chaika or other females.\\n\r\nChaika is the fourteen year old daughter of the Emperor Gaz whose memories are missing.She has a very strong wish to gather the remains.She has a good honest nature and is the only one that can use magic in the group.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe music of the opening was excellent even though I didn\u2019t like the animation that went with it. Both the ending and the opening fitted this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe character desings were very good.I really liked Chaikas desing.The battle scenes were also good.The movements of the weapons and combat techniques were very smooth. The animators werent afraid to show blood which made it even more better.\\n\\n\r\nEnyojment 8/10\\n\r\nEvery aspect of the show was enyojable , from the plot to characters interaction. Watching this show made for a very relaxing and interesting expirience.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for the gramatical mistakes in the review and thanks for reading.",

            "content": "This is a review for both seasons to fully encompass the show. \r\nFirst off, I went into this show with LOW expectations. Oh man, I was horribly mistaken. Overall, I give the series an 8.5. For 22 episodes I was just amazed. It has action, it has gore, it has comedy. And furthermore it has a decent story, an amazing musical score and good characters.\r\nStory: Chaika, a female with white hair and purple eyes gathering the remains of the Taboo Emperor. MC, Toru, unemployed, struggling ever since the great war ended 5 years ago. While he is in the mountains picking up edible plants, heruns into Chaika who is horribly lost. But before introductions can be properly made they encounter a unicorn (not the ones from a fairy tale) and are forced to team up to fight it. After everything happens, Chaika offers Toru and his sister employment, to help her gather her father's remains to give him a proper burial. \\n\r\nThis story is full of twists and turns, deceit and shock. This is one of the better animes that is horribly dark when you start looking into it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I thought this anime would be bland, but I was wrong. It has amazing art work, the scenes are very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: First review I have had something to say other than fair; this anime for both seasons has an amazing musical track. This show was carefully crafted and well executed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: All of the characters are well developed and progressively grow throughout the show. They aren't one dimensional, they don't try to brush everything off. These characters have depth, they are all well connected and intertwined.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: This show is usually in the top 15 that I recommend. It hit every expectation and then some. I have watched this show roughly 4 times now and it keeps getting better and better. This is an odd ball show with not a lot of fan service but it is a must watch for any anime lover.",

The twist, the remains are in possession of the \"Great Heroes\" who murdered him. Interesting concept, held my attention with various plot twists. Amnesia must be fun device to write.\r\nArt 8 - Character designs were actually pretty good. Chaika herself being the most unique in the series. Scenery was breathtaking in several shots. Well done, maintained a great overall aesthetic. Worth stating that the CG is solid.\r\nSound 6 - A bit above par for the course butnothing to write home about. It did it's job well in some regards, for example with weapon sound effects, but others were on the weaker side. *cough* music *cough*. Good opening song fit the show pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7 - Pretty good roster with Chaika herself being the standout. MC turned out to be less generic than expected. MC doesn't use a big dumb sword, opting for a more rogue-like combat style, fitting for his past.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7 - Overall an enjoyable anime. Glad I finally took the time to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 7 - Certainly good in it's own right. While it may not be one of the greats, it is certainly worth the watch if you have finished them already. If you are in the mood for it, you will probably like it too. Looking forward to watching season 2, which is out at the time of this writing. \"Avenging Battle\".\\n",

            "content": "Hey folks this will be a review for Hitsugi no Chaika. This anime was very entertaining. I give it an 8 out of dislike of some later dialogue and character action, but I would highly recommend giving this one a shot. \r\nThe story is actually pretty interesting. A young girl named Chaika Trabant is looking for the remains of her dead father, emperor Gaz. At the start of the show we are introduced to our two main characters through and interaction in the woods. A deal is made between them and for the rest of the show we follow this party of people as theygo out and seek the remains. Along the way we learn about the mysterious past of Chaika, the basic overview of the post war world, and the interest surrounding these remains.\\n\\n\r\nMany things happen along the way, and though there is some filler, the story progresses at a solid pace. The filler has some back story on some characters and doesn't feel intrusive or out of place. The ending is satisfactory for a first season, and I'm definitely interested in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nThe art looks poor on the cover image, however its not bad in the anime itself. The animation is pretty fluid, there are a lot of fight scenes and they all play out nice and smoothly. The music and voice acting are pretty standard and nice.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really well done, at least some of them. Chaika at the start is really well done. She is rather ditzy, yet a very powerful mage. She speaks oddly and he charm is that of a defenseless little girl with a large task, feels a lot like Frodo and the ring. Acura, Tooru is a Saboteur who lives with his childhood friend who he calls his sister. Tooru is powerful, but he is very balanced in terms of story. You never know if hes going to win a fight. He also manages to stick to his Saboteur character, being better at laying traps, being agile and mostly cold and calculating. Acura, Akari is his childhood friend who is also a Saboteur and is skilled with the hammer. She likes Tooru and follows him wherever, but not in a possessive annoying fashion. Fredrica is a Dragoon that gets picked up near the middle of the show, shes really a convenience and doesn't have a large role to play.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are another party of people who are trying to capture Chaika.They think she is going to try and bring together the destroyed Gaz Empire. I wont list everyone as mostly they are rather unimportant. Gillette, Alb\u00e9ric though is the leader for this group and again we get to see some really well written character. Gillette feels like the typical pampered prince character who only seeks \"justice\". Though this is a central part of his role he takes time to think over his actions and questions his own outlook on justice. He often will go against the typical spotlight of all the good in the world and make decisions like a normal person might, admitting his weaknesses and his faults too. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime far more than I was expecting to. I gushed a little in the character section, but it truly deserves more praise than I'm giving it. I hate shows with static good and evil, cut and dry characters. The story itself was interesting but as it didnt get finished this season I cant really tell if its going to be good or not. Some really annoying moments pop up from time to time however. Chaika becomes more steadfast and leaderly later, however only showing this character trait to get tricked by some person or persons and making work hard for her and the Saboteur's. She also has an odd mini melt down towards the end that doesn't really mesh well with previous events. Viivi is attached to Gillette and acts exactly like a possesive snobbish brat and really is tedious to see her come on the screen. However that's most of my gripes with the show.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Great characters, decent art, interesting story. Give this a shot if you like fantasy, its way better than I thought it would be.\\n",

            "content": "Once in a while you come across an anime that shows great promise, the basic ideas are great and the story is intriguing. Shows like that often develop into masterpieces but others veer off-course and descend into mediocrity.\r\nIn a land where wars are no more, after the overthrowing of the old emperor, we are introduced to a veteran who has no place in this world, as all he can do well is fight. While hunting he stumbles upon a white-haired girl carrying a casket, and they are then immediately attacked by an unicorn. Together they manage to escape the beast and he finds out thatshe, Chaika, is the daughter of the late emperor. She tells him she is looking for the remains of her father so she can then bury him, and asks him if he could help her steal one of the remains in the possession of a local nobleman. Longing for a purpose he jumps at the opportunity and together with his sister he joins the search for the remains of Chaika\u2019s father.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly for an anime it starts off exploring the subject of veterans as what is a solider to do in a world where wars are over. Even more interesting is the fact that throughout the show we se people longing for war, wether they are normal soldiers, civilians or even royalty. But all of this is not for the sake of personal gain but solely for the excitement and the feeling of belonging somewhere. \\n\r\nThe story as a whole keeps evolving and manages to be surprisingly original in its plot-twists. One problem with all of these different directions is that many of the themes are explored not explored nearly enough and seem to be just forgotten or ignored. The twelve episode format is not helping with this at all as something so packed with events is hard to stuff into such a short duration. To add insult to injury we are also following the story of their pursuers which seemed absolutely unnecessary. The series has a very unique view in magic as it is portrayed in the form of guns. The whole thing runs on memories of once living beings, such as different fossils, well actually they can also use their own memories but then loose those memories they use, but this is not expanded nearly enough so we do not get any details.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Chaika, she is in my opinion one of the most memorable female characters I have seen in anime. She has the memory of her childhood, but knows nothing about the time of the fall of her father. The only thing she knows is that she is to gather her fathers remains and give him a proper burial. She is very trusting an has non existent social skills, she can\u2019t even normally talk as she spouts out only words, not whole sentences. Next we have Tooru and his sister Akari, both are saboteurs, trained from their early childhood to fight as mercenaries and have been aimlessly wandering around since the end of the war not knowing what to do. They aren't the most exciting characters, but they are perfectly fine. They have this typical brother sister dynamic, as they are portrayed as sort of rivals, always trying to be better than the other, but at the same time deeply devoted to one another. Then we have a team that is trying to track our main trio down and stop Chaika from gathering the remains. They are a group of fairly capable fighters but they are facing the dilemma of hunting down a girl only looking to bury her father. Later on we are introduced to some other moderately important characters which are mostly great and really help the story flow along.\\n\\n\r\nIn the visual department I have no complaints, everything looks nice even if some 3d models look a bit out of place but considering the small budget it is all good. The soundtrack is nice as well and I especially liked the opening theme.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Hitsugi no Chaika has so many great ideas and moments of brilliance, that are brought down by rather poor execution,but still it never falls into mediocrity as so may other anime do. So the show gets a nice 8 from me and a recommendation for everyone. Im am already looking forward to seeing the second season.\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this review feel free to check out my other reviews or leave a comment",

            "content": "Story:8/10 \r\nWhile the story seems to be a very basic \"collect an amount of magical things\", Hitsugi no Chaika  changes the formula just enough to still make a very enjoying viewing  experience. This is mostly supported through the insanely fast pace this anime has which keeps the parts that are expected short and forgettable and the surprising changes feel like swift strikes of awesomeness. But even though the plot is moving quickly, nothing feels rushed or not fully developed.But it should be mentioned that the climax keeps in line with the fast pace so do not expect a huge epic showdown at theend. This comes kind of as a problem since the Anime hypes you up to the maximum and then just delivers something short and sweet which can be fairly disappointing. All in all it exceeded my  expectations and went to many different places \\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Sound: 7/10\\n\r\nNothing much to say about Hitsugi no Chaikas art it is beautiful but still pretty basic and not really anything special. It shines during the fight scenes  during which this anime looks superb. \\n\r\nThe Art Style has its moments but remains quite basic.\\n\r\nSame goes or the sound design. There aren\u00b4t any themes or tracks that i would care for but also none that could be described as irritating or annoying. In total Soundtrack just smoothly supports the scenes without shining to much itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nThe character of Hitsugi no Chaika are a real refreshing break of many cliques found in popular of Shounen. They are not as deep as i personally would have liked but still enough to very enjoyable to much and is a nice turn away form the usual one sided pale bread \"shall not be able to be possibly disliked by anyone\" protagonists. The Characters have many different views on different subject which at many points can surprise you. This makes it much easier to sympathize with the characters and have fun watching them since they feel way more real then just drawings on a screen with archetypes attached. You will not find a great character study with an emotional roller coaster in this show but some very fun and loveable characters experiencing an intriguing adventure with much character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8/10 \\n\r\nIf you like fast action a quick story Hitsugi no Chaika is a great ride. It is very fun and short Shounen to watch in an episodic format if you cant invest time to binge watch a larger or more philosophically deep series. Warning: This show sometimes gets very dark very fast so if you dont like  downright depressing story lines and/or a bit of gore then the enjoyment factor can drop at some parts in the story but i would say it is still worth a watch. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime was on my target list ever since I heard it was coming out, the  L.N. author who wrote Outbreak Company which I greatly enjoyed, also wrote this adapted L.N.. What I liked about Outbreak Company is that it had some cleverness when describing otaku culture, and I was hoping it will bring the same cleverness to Hitsugi no Chaika with its \u201cafter war setting\u201d. Well, it kind of did. Even though it did not live up to my expectations in that way, it did bring me a fun simple engaging story with a lot of cool action scenes \r\nPlot\r\nThe plot of thisanime is about two saboteurs that are now living civilian lives after fighting in the Great War. The main protagonist has find little motivation to do civilian work, so now he lives like a bum, while his brother-loving sister does all the work. A girl named Chaika comes into town, and she needs help in carrying out a mission. The two saboteurs go with this girl on her mission. As they traveled, they witness many people who were warriors during the  great war, but now find their skills useless during peacetime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the series can be a little stale, often their personalities are one dimensional. You get characters like the incentrous sister, a character who wants to fight, and the one word speaking Chaika. I found the enemy captain trying to capture Chaika\u2019s to be the most interesting since he questions of what he is doing correct\\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\\n\r\nI found the animation to be average, a little underwhelming. The studio Bones has currently has three anime they are doing concurrently this Spring anime season including this one, and it seems that Chaika got the short end of the stick when it comes to animation budget. Even though the animation could be a little better, the action scenes were fairly consistent and the animation was doable. The best part of the animation is the sudden scenes of violence.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nI found the opening to be a little bit uninspiring, but the Ending song was a little bit better. The background music was fairly consistent when switching from action to leisure.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nIn all, I found the show enjoyable. The beginning of the show can be a little slow, but as time passes on the show gets better and better. Also the show is simple enough for that it does not have any useless side-plots. The show ends pretty dramatically at the end, and I cannot wait for season 2.\\n",

            "content": "Emperor Arthur Gaz ruled for 500 years. But his reign ended after he was slain by the Eight Heroes, ending a long war between the Emperor and the alliance of six nations. The alliance scatters his remains in fear of whatever residual magic they might have. Now we move on to the present day. The show follows a pair of saboteurs, Tooru Acura and Akari Acura. Their new adventures begin when they meet Chaika Trabant, a girl with a coffin on her back whose aim is to search for her father, the late Emperor\u2019s, scattered remains in order to give him a proper burial. However,this makes them the enemies of the alliance of six nations, as their aim is to apprehend Chaika.\\n\\n\r\nImo cool concept, but I wish the execution was better. Chaika carrying that coffin (which contains a sniper rifle running on magic) is a sight to see, taking her small physique into account. Then there was this soundtrack they inserted when the characters would face impending crisis, but it failed to add much intensity or hook me in. Fight scenes were underwhelming, the saboteurs\u2019 \u201csuper mode\u201d \u2013 the Iron Blood Transformation \u2013 was lacking in badassery (if that even is a word), though I admit the incantation to activate it sounded kind of cool. S1 was decent because of that, but could have been much better. \\n\\n\r\nWould recommend if you want to see something fresh, this something being how a girl with a small physique carries a huge-ass coffin with a sniper rifle (I imagine that would be quite heavy). If you like magic and some medieval setting, that\u2019s another reason to watch this show. There\u2019s also an interesting revelation this show has, but not about to spoil it.\\n",

            "content": "I had no idea what I was getting into when I started Chaika: The Coffin Princess. Hadn\u2019t read a synopsis, hadn\u2019t looked at a genre. I only knew that Chaika\u2019s face was a meme, so this was going to be a completely new experience for me.\r\nI was pleasantly surprised by what I got.\r\nThe titular Coffin Princess is our main character and perhaps the most moe girl I\u2019ve come across in years (more on that later). When lost in a forest and chased by a unicorn that wants to kill her, she teams up with a saboteur named Toru and his sister, Akari. Why does Chaikacarry a coffin around? It holds her magical sniper rifle, but it will also be used for her penultimate goal; to collect all the parts of her dead father\u2019s body so she can give him a burial.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, she\u2019s the daughter of the last king, a powerful mage who sent the world into turmoil. Eight heroes attacked and killed him, each taking a body part with them. So you can see where this is going. Chaika and the gang go to the residences of those who killed the king, fight them, and get part of the father.\\n\\n\r\nIt gets more complicated when women who look like Chaika show up, some with the intent of getting the parts of the body, others wanting to stop those in search of the parts.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s an average plot that plays out pretty simply with a small twist toward the end of the season that I think I figured out by episode five or six.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I can commend the plot on is creating a somewhat interesting fantasy setting. After the king was killed five years ago, the world is in recovery after nothing but war. Recovery is hard and there are competing factions across the board; some who want war and others who are trying to protect the peace.\\n\\n\r\nOne of these organizations is the Postwar Restoration Agency, who chases Chaika through her travels, believing her quest to be for ill purposes. I only mention them because the show occasionally focuses on the members, especially a childish and poorly done romantic thread.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Chaika\u2018s plot play out is like watching the average linear fantasy video game. From one section to another with little segue and each level contains a boss and a treasure chest after the fight.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation isn\u2019t great. It looks more like a kids show than one aimed at teens. The girls themselves are ridiculously cute, mostly because I have an eyebrow fetish (and so do a lot of others apparently).\\n\\n\r\nMusic is another average. The opening and closing were alright and music during the show was pretty typical for a fantasy show\u2013except for one instance. Said instance is the second to last episode near a mid-show title card. As the action ramps up, we\u2019re presented a score that must have been courtesy of Neal Morse or Transatlantic. It\u2019s a completely random prog rock riff that makes no sense being there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are also average. Chaika herself is, as mentioned, adorable as hell while not being silly. Something the series does right is not joking around enough to take you out of the world. It never resorts to cartoonishness for a laugh, nor does it overtly use any of the female characters for sexual comedy. There\u2019s a few laughs from Akari (who is not actually Toru\u2019s sisters) being in love with him and defensive when he gets close to Chaika.\\n\\n\r\nThe cuteness of the show lends itself to small things Chaika does. When her coffin hits the top of a doorframe, she\u2019s visibly frazzled for a second. At one point she falls backward during a climb and just lays on the coffin, staring up at the ceiling.She also can\u2019t speak well, so I guess that\u2019s kind of cute.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s moe as hell, silly, and I haven\u2019t d\u2019awwed so hard since watching Tomoko try to survive the world. So there\u2019s that.\\n\\n\r\nToru is a weak character but I appreciate how much of a non-wuss he is. He isn\u2019t edgy, mind you, but he\u2019ll kill if he has to. His sister is the same way though a little more silly.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a dragoon named Fredricka, a shape-shifter who only goes on the adventure in the hope of fighting Toru.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does all of this add up to? A pretty average yet very entertaining experience. The action scenes in the show are plentiful and well-done, the magic system is interesting, and Chaika is cute as hell. This comes at the expense of good characters, plot, a fully developed world, or above-average writing though.\\n\\n\r\nChaika was a fun, easy watch and a charming palette cleanser after my last review.",

Hitsugi no Chaika and its sequel Hitsugi no Chaika: Avenging Battle are worthy to be on your list if you like adventures in a magical world. The magic is mixed with sci-f and its all made into a surprising, evolving story. \r\nIts characters have personality and have some development as well. It even has humour, but most of all it has that feeling that you don't want it to end, just like a good book, waiting to read thelast chapters because you don't want it finished.\\n\\n\r\nI gave high marks to this anime all over.",
