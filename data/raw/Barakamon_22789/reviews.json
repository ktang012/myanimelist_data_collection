            "content": "Barakamon shows that you don't need aliens, magical powers and love triangles in order to create an exciting anime. Barakamon is not a tale of good triumphing over evil or a couple finding true love within one another, but rather an example of why our uneventful daily lives is story enough, even if said life involves being assaulted by small children. \r\nThere isn't a great deal that occurs in Barakamon's regrettably short 12-episode run. There is no overarching, deep story to keep you on the edge of your seat, and by the end of the final episode, not a whole lot has changed from thebeginning. If you were to explain the story of Barakamon to one of your friends, they would likely respond by saying \"That's it? Sounds boring.\" And they would be horribly wrong, as Barakamon is easily one of the best anime of the entire year.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Barakamon are the story. It is about Handa Seishuu, a 23-year-old calligrapher prone to anger and misfortune, and his friendship with the villagers who continually screw him over through a myriad of hilarious accidents. He does not undergo a great transformation by the end of the anime, but simply experiences the joy of human companionship, and no-- this theme is not told through preaching morals. Barakamon is very subtle with its themes, choosing instead to develop characters gradually and believably rather than through melodrama. As immature as Handa and the characters often are, Barakamon is actually a surprisingly mature anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Handa finds himself staring in awe at the starry night, the writers do not feel the need to explain what Handa is feeling at that moment. At that point in the story, Handa has been characterised so believably that empathising with his thoughts and feelings becomes natural. He's not a walking gag, an archetype made to appeal to the audience's most basic instincts. He is his own person, highly flawed and vulnerable to mistakes. Whereas most anime protagonists are so dull, so devoid of personality or history that you could throw them into just about any other show, Handa feels at home in his own series. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the same can be said for all the other characters. The kids, especially Naru in particular, are unique in the way that they actually behave like kids. Naru is mouthy, aggressive and intellectually inferior to the adults. She collects bugs, finds poop funny, eats live snails (ugh!) and annoys Handa in just about every way possible. Naru is not cute in the same way that loli characters are. She is an actual child, not a pretend-child created to please the nether regions of lolicons. Just like real, living kids, Naru and her companions are often frustrating and bring ruin to just about everything they encounter, but that energy is precisely what makes them so endearing. \\n\\n\r\nThe humour of Barakamon is also surprisingly thoughtful, and it hits the mark more than perhaps could ever be expected from an anime. There were no moments where the joke fell completely flat (as was sometimes the case with similar anime like Silver Spoon and Gekkan Shoujo). There are few, if any puns and stereotypical Japanese humour, even if it does still follow the typical manzai format of stupid-thing-happens-and-people-react-to-stupid-thing. The stupid things in Barakamon work because they are actually rooted in reality. It doesn't create its comedy through the characters reacting in some ridiculous, unbelievable way, but through the kinds of accidents that typically follow from playing with children. And from Handa suffering. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike most slice-of-life comedies, Barakamon knows how to strike a perfect balance between its humour and the more heart-warming moments. These moments are well-placed and purposely kept rare so that they may carry meaning. What most anime are incapable of grasping is that in the real world, we find beauty in between mountains of hardship; it is not something that can be created artificially and sold and traded at the dollar store. Barakamon understands this, which is precisely why its events feel so natural, even if they do not carry any huge wave of emotion along with them. \\n\\n\r\nBarakamon also deserves some praise for its willingness to tell a story with characters of all ages. There are the kids, a few teenagers in the local high school, the adult protagonist and his friends from the city, and the middle-aged and elderly villagers. It does not focus solely on 15-year-olds, and for that Barakamon is all the more special.\\n\\n\r\nThe calligraphy aspect of the show does have its share of issues, though. Because the focus is almost entirely on the comedy and the slice-of-life, there isn't much detail given to the calligraphy world that Handa is a part of. What makes a good piece of writing? What makes a bad one? Why is Handa's new style so much more meaningful, and what is it even like to be a calligrapher? None of these questions are fully answered. If you don't have any knowledge of calligraphy (and I expect you won't-- I certainly did not), then it's likely these scenes will not do much for you. I found myself much more invested in all the immature shenanigans that occurred between Handa and the villagers. At the very least, I suppose it did show that there's a bit more to calligraphy than simply slapping cool-looking kanji on a piece of paper. \\n\\n\r\nBarakamon looks and sounds great. While there's no gorgeous setpieces and scenery to bring heaven to your eyeballs, the artwork is still very attractive and consistent. The opening track is also pure bliss. I would recommend giving it a listen any time you're feeling awful; it's like magic. \\n\\n\r\nWill Barakamon shock and bring you to tears? Probably not. But it will almost assuredly change the opinions of anyone who previously found the slice-of-life genre boring, and what it lacks in emotional value it makes up for by being executed nearly to perfection. It is one of the most enjoyable, pleasant experiences I've had with an anime in a very long time, and anyone who simply wants to have a good time and relax would be doing themselves a huge favour by giving Barakamon a try. Its greatest sin is that there just isn't any more of it to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the best anime of 2014, Barakamon is the winner in my eyes.",

            "content": "Watching Barakamon was like going to a birthday party or a picnic outdoors, chock full of excited children running all over the place, doing what they do best. As an adult (supposedly), you feel slightly out of place but the child in you just wants to jump up and down with them in frantic jubilation without a care in the world. There is a cake too: a black forest with strawberry toppings and as you immerse yourself in the jovial mood, you admit that the feeling of sharing a slice with everyone is sweeter than the cake itself.\r\nAnd what a slice it was!\r\nFor a slice-of-lifeto succeed, it needs to have a decent premise which sets it up and allows it to deliver a constant flow of quality\u2026 well slice-of-lives. For Barakamon, getting the socially inept and awkward \u201ccity-boy\u201d Handa to live in a rural island where the residents are both normal and weird at the same time was the perfect set-up. You can already see it in the first episode. In fact, for me the show stepped up a level in the scene where Handa throws out Naru and she is rolling out going \u201cgyaaaah!\u201d in her lovable and unique accent.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, we follow the life of Seishuu Handa on a place very new and unfamiliar to him: doing some things for the first time, making new friends, enjoying the beauty of nature, picking fights with grade-school kids, catching beetles and going through a plethora of experiences on the island. All the while, he is searching for his own style of calligraphy. I admit that this was the only part of the show that was sort of a miss rather than a hit, for me at least. This stemmed from the fact that I found it impossible to discern the difference of the quality of the works and how Handa\u2019s Calligraphy evolved as the show went on. However, having said that, it is clear that the island life has a profound impact on it: after all, no one can deny the fact that he is inspired by it. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the impressive aspect of the show is the way in which it integrates doses of comedy here and there. In fact, I would say that it is slightly more hilarious than the norm of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show is wonderful. It is laid-back in general but takes longer strides if need be without rushing itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe only rushing in the show is the little Naru rushing to Handa\u2019s house both of whom are totally lovable characters. Handa is surprisingly childish and immature even though he doesn\u2019t realize it which makes it easier for him to connect with the kids and the reactions brought on by his impulsive nature are priceless and hilarious. He is the only one who is significantly developed as the series progresses but that is understandable and okay. \\n\\n\r\nLittle Naru is one of the main allure of the show. She is full of energy and life probably more than a normal 7-year old. You could call her a bit pesky but you would be doing so with a loving smile because her peskiness really helps break down the wall around Handa. Her attachment to Handa is cute indeed and helps their friendship blossom leading to more fun and eventful days for both of them. The only qualm here is that she is not as much developed as a character, even as the show goes on. She, more or less remains the same which is not bad as she is great just the way she is but still one senses a lost potential there.\\n\\n\r\nWithout going into detail about the other characters, it is suffice to say that they are all sufficiently unique and lovable. From a fujoshi in denial to a lively tomboy to a group of cheerful kids, this show has a slightly large cast. Most importantly though, they are all easily likable even if they do suffer from a lack of development which again is understandable as most of the development is focused on Handa. The best part is their interactions which are top-notch and really help carry the show forward. For instance, seeing a grown man being enlightened by 7 year olds complete with his mortified reactions is quite charming and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharming is the right word for the art as well. A good amount of light and vibrant colors have been used. The backgrounds are decently picturesque and the character designs have also been neatly done and are easily distinguishable. I liked how they made the faces of the children slightly chubbier to sort of contrast them to the more \u2018pointed\u2019 ones of the adults. The different facial expressions of the characters especially of the two mains are also impressive and enjoyable. And the animation is also up to par.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, the first tick goes to Naru\u2019s seiyuu who is a kid as well. Actually, kudos to the production team for getting child actors for the roles of those cute kids. Plus, they incorporated a unique dialect for the inhabitants of the island which just adds to the atmosphere and overall feel of the show. The BGM were also decent and as for the opening and ending: although they are not really great, they are slightly better than average. The ending especially managed to stay on my playlist for quite some time and was perfect for the show.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nThis show cannot be recommended enough for those seeking a simple slice-of-life full of smiles and laughs and heartwarming moments. After a long hard day, just get yourself a slice of this cake and enjoy the utter bliss that it is. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Barakamon is a work of art. However, it\u2019s more than just calligraphy as words alone cannot describe the exact nature and discovery of Barakamon. For instance, the show takes place on an island involving a young man named Seishuu Handa. Coming from a more urban based background, his life changes forever as he finds his new life on the natural island of Goto. Of course, this doesn\u2019t happen after he delivers a sucker punch to an elder curator. When someone throws a fit like that, it\u2019s easy to guess that consequences are destined to follow. But can we really call a journey to Goto Islandas a consequence? Perhaps it\u2019s the beginning of a new life for Seishuu Handa. Barakmon explores that new life in this wonderful and charming series that is guaranteed to bring satisfaction through discovery.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the manga written by Satsuki Yoshino, the series has a simple premise. It adapts a slice of life tone hence depicting it like a narrative style with Seishuu as the main protagonist. It\u2019s simple to realize the show has its charm in the beginning with laughter. Seishuu\u2019s exile to Goto Island makes him the new guy in a brand new world. While the setting still takes play in the modern world, the inhabitants and surroundings contrast of what he is used to. For instance, there are no expensive cars or fancy skyscrapers where businessmen work during their workaholic hours. Rather, everything feels natural with a derivative from civilization. In essence, the show is about learning and discovery for Seishuu because he must adapt in this new environment. Now, that\u2019s not a pushover.\u2019\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, the show has the ability to maintain a balanced atmosphere. We see Seishuu and his frustration yet also curiosity on the island. He discovers how simple life yet can be difficult at the same time. It\u2019s a stark contrast to how his former life used to be. And as a master calligrapher, he is all about creation. With that in mind, Barakamon has this mercurial elegance with the style of its characters. Many of its characters live a simple life whether it\u2019s the villagers, neighbors, or kids. They don\u2019t rely solely on advanced technology as evidenced by the old fashioned phones and their way of fishing food. Yet, they also choose to use tools beyond the Amish norm to adapt and survive. For Seishuu, he is like babyface ready to learn everything that needs to be learned.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, there is a noticeable age gap between certain groups. We have kids such as Naru, Miwa, and Tamako. Then, there are others within Seishuu\u2019s age group such as Kazuyuki. It\u2019s certainly an interesting factor to see how Seishuu develop relationships between these characters. Perhaps the most prominent relationship explored throughout the show is Naru and Seishuu. Having over a 15 year age gap doesn\u2019t seem to make the duo compatible to watch at first. However, there\u2019s a certain charm to this relationship as Naru often inspires Seishuu to climb out of his stoic self. Although he is made fun of at first by the kids with nicknames such as \u201cJunon Boy\u201d, there is also a strong attachment between them. In due time, Naru refers him as sensei, as a sign of respect for his brilliant skills in calligraphy. Similarly, Seishuu begins to see the kids in a different light. Despite finding him to be a nuisance, he also learns more from them to adapt with culture. The \u201cnew guy in school\u201d tone has a presence when kids greet him with curiosity. It\u2019s like an escapist adventure for Seishuu rather than a punishment for being exiled. To label it as a consequence could actually be the wrong term since the show offers tons of discovery for Seishuu thanks to his new life. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the strongest aspect of Barakamon is its ability to tell a story without complicated angles such as clich\u00e9 rom-coms or battle shounens. Each episode itself is a story that cleverly show Seishuu\u2019s life rather than tell. Indeed, they also tie in with Seishuu\u2019s calligraphy skill as it plays as an influence throughout the show. Furthermore, the show has a heartwarming atmosphere and innocence. As much as Seishuu is curious about his new surroundings, the kids too are eager to learn. Through Seishu, they learn more about him and essence of the outside life. Remember, these kids are young and wishes to learn beyond school textbooks. With sensei there as a guidance, the kids get a lot out of his presence. It also creates an incalculable attachment as each episode brings them closer in that intimate way. They become like a family, one that in that Barakamonish to the core.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is also wise when it comes down to forming friendships. Seishuu makes friends with other characters including high school students and residents of his own age. Seishuu finds friendship in an authentic way through interactions. Surprisingly enough, some of their skills doesn\u2019t differ from his own. Take for example, 14-year old Tamako Arai\u2019s dream is to become a manga artist. Through her interactions with Seishuu, she is even more inspired to make that dream into a reality. Of course, the show also spice up some comedy between the characters as the kids play him as the fool. It\u2019s what friends do after all. You make jokes, laugh at them, and have fun while doing so. It creates connection in that lighthearted way with realism. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of realism, there\u2019s plenty of that. The show takes place on island so the atmosphere feels natural with energy. The cool breeze and surroundings offers a lavish theater for its backgrounds. Furthermore, it brings about a feeling of escapism for the hardships of civilization such as poverty and crime. In essence, it creates a relaxing setting for our characters to enjoy in. And by standards, most of the characters puts on a smile every day. (perhaps in Seishuu\u2019s case though). They greet activities such as calligraphy, fishing, and swimming with pleasure and enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nComedy is welcoming into the series too without shock values or senseless fan service. Rather, it relies on practical jokes, references, and imaginative tropes to deliver its message. However, the comedy sometimes feels abused when it comes to ideas such as BL; often generated by misunderstandings. It creates a repetitiveness that can be bothering to watch on occasions. Some other gags also quickly becomes old when it\u2019s played over and over. Characterization also isn\u2019t a big strength and feels flat with the younger characters. We only realize their general backgrounds without too much insight on their personalities. Perhaps the show is also a bit too simple as even rivalries (Seishuu and Kanazai) comes off as dull. Indeed, the series doesn\u2019t craft its story thoroughly with plot devices or progression. Instead, it relies on narrative scenarios with the life of Seishuu.\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Kinema Citrus, the show has a very natural taste of its backgrounds. Mountains, rivers, and the neighborhood are structured to look as realistic as it can be. Similarly, characters are crafted out of simplistic designs. The girls doesn\u2019t have heavy makeup nor are the guys decorated with bishounen artistry. They all look who they seem to be with their matching personality. It\u2019s like a breath of fresh air with its realistic character designs. There\u2019s also no fan service or awkward camera angles to raise eyebrows. An added bonus is the calligraphy itself for theme and symbolism of art. It\u2019s downright simple, realistic, and portrays slice of life at its best.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to soundtrack, Barakamon can be dry at times. Yet, it is fluid when you examine it with its conventional music. The OST offers a well-balanced tone with its fashionable soundtrack. The coordination of the music also stands out when it comes with comedic scenes and pacing. Similarly, Seishuu\u2019s voice mannerism is portrayed quite well with his emotions ranging from frustration to joy. I also give praise to voice acting to characters such as Naru and Hina. They talk exactly like kids with their goofy remarks and laughter that inspires a curious LOL moment. The OP and ED songs are decent with unique backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is morbidly gratifying especially if you had one of those tiring day. Its simplicity will take your mind off of life. And speaking of life, we get to see exactly how people live on the island of Goto. For Seishu, it\u2019s entertaining with a handful of new discoveries he finds in his new life. But as a gift for the viewers, you will discover a whole lot more than just an island and its people. You\u2019ll discover an honest show about a colorful cast of characters for their worth. And to be honest, it\u2019s worth it.\\n",

            "content": "One of the hallmarks of a quality slice of life show is its ability to make you forget about the real world and immerse you in their world, if only for a few minutes. You laugh alongside the characters as they do silly things, get anxious as they struggle through trials and tribulations, and then feel relieved when those problems are resolved. Barakamon does an excellent job of accentuating this aspect of the slice of life genre. Through a cast of quirky and unique characters along with simple yet powerful storytelling, Barakamon portrays the life of a man who strives to discover his true identityand style.\\n\\n\r\nHanda Seishuu, a young but promising calligraphy professional, after reacting in an extreme manner to criticism, finds himself whisked away from modern Tokyo to a rural island for a period of reevaluation and reflection. Barakamon tells the story of Handa's time on the island, his interactions with the village folk, and the search for a calligraphy style that he can call his own. With this simple premise, Barakamon delivers a show that is light hearted, comedical, and downright enjoyable to watch. It was nigh impossible to go through a single episode without a big, silly grin all over my face.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom feeling worried for Handa's latest calligraphy contest results to laughing as he attempts to hide his embarrassment due to not knowing how to use a rotary phone, while Barakamon might be a bit slow paced, there is rarely a dull moment. Moreover, although events such as painting the name of a boat onto its hull, or participating in a mochi catching contest may seem to have no deeper meaning other than to define Barakamon as a slice of life, the beautiful aspect of this show is that everything seems to have an underlying meaning or message that helps Handa grow as a person and realize what's important in life. \\n\\n\r\nIt is amazing how much adults can learn from children, despite once being children themselves. Their naive and simple way of thinking and positive outlook can do wonders for an adult struggling with the more mature problems of the world. A change in perspective or a shift in thought process; sometimes that's all you need to overcome the more complex issues in life. In Barakamon, this is very apparent as you watch Naru and the other village children completely change Handa through simple actions and conversations. It was a pleasure to watch Handa transform from a hot headed, close minded, and unsociable person into someone with broad horizons and an open mindset who takes life a little less seriously while enjoying it so much more.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are often what makes or breaks a slice of life show, and Barakamon's cast definitely make the show. From the scrappy and unpredictable ball of energy that is Naru, to the calm and reserved Akki, the wide variety of personalities Handa encounters on the island made the show very spirited and refreshing to watch. We have the troublemaking middle school girl duo of Miwa and Tama who are a riot to watch; Tama with her aspirations of being a mangaka and Miwa, the lovable tomboy who just wants life to be a bit more eventful. Although they tease Handa a whole bunch, at the end of the day they genuinely care for him and they, along with the other children, teach him what it means to care about others. In addition to the people of the village, we have Kawafuji, Handa's constant support from behind the scenes and a childhood friend who always looks out for him, and Kanzaki, a fellow calligrapher who idolizes Handa and serves as his rival and motivation to improve his own calligraphy further. It is amazing how Barakamon's supporting cast of characters all affect Handa in some way, and is one of the reasons Barakamon is an excellent slice of life show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is lively and the animation is a bit rough, but fits the style of the show quite well. The highlights were Naru's eccentric movements and general facial expressions in depressing/hilarious situations. The music was pretty standard slice of life fare; however, the opening and ending in particular were well done and fit the show like a glove. While there is room for improvement in both aspects, there is nothing major to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon delivers a slice of life show that we've been missing for quite some time. With the amount of cute girls doing cute things and moe shows, Barakamon was a much needed breath of fresh air. A cute, endearing, and heartwarming story about a calligrapher who seeks for a style he can call his own, Barakamon is a solid pick up for any slice of life fan.",

I wasn't a big fan of slice of life anime, even though i had watched some after, i used to think that this genre was boring.\r\nBarakamon prove that i was wrong. The show don't let the rhythm down in all of the 12 episodes. All the characters are good, there's no one that i've disliked, and that's pretty difficult in all anime.\r\nThe comedy on Barakamon it's natural, not something forced with stupid jokes, the characters are just funny. Handastarts to grown like human on the anime what can be seen in the last 3 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty good.Handa  starts to choose his own way on callygraphy, and to understand what is really important to him.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds in general in the anime are truly AMAZING! The opening \"Rashisa\" is perfect for the anime. The soundtracks perfectly match the moments too. I usually don't like much endings, sometimes i don't even see, but the ending theme \"Innoccence\" it's pretty good too.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think that everyone will like this show like i did. But i think that everyone needs to give it a try, because it's really good!",

            "content": "Without fail, this anime had me in stitches after hours and hours of watching all the episodes for 2 days. (sorry, I didn't finish it in one because of chores.)  \r\nTruth is, I saw a screenshot of this anime in my profile and I was interested in seeing it. It was a picture of mangas being piled up in a bag. Two of those mangas were my favorites; namely, Soul Eater and Fullmetal Alchemist. I got interested so I looked it up without viewing its synopsis and started seeing it. I was first in distraught when I found out that the first episode tacklesabout a man being in shame after punching a critic who demolished his whole world by saying a very hurtful comment about his calligraphy. I thought that maybe I was viewing this show and making a waste of time and energy. But I decided to give it a shot. \\n\\n\r\nBarakamon has a simple yet a refreshing plot. The MC ventures on a quest to find a peace of his mind and to have an adventure in a certain province that will either help him fail or achieve success in winning the calligraphy contest. It sure does seem boring at first because not all of us just sit and and talk about calligraphy once in a while because we are not at all interested in it. On the other hand, it actually has a deeper meaning to it. Handa (MC), meets a variety of people that gives him food, infuriates him, and somehow gives him ideas. Meanwhile, the MC is still on the verge finding out whether the people in the province serves him as a distraction, inspiration or both. As I go around halfway through the series, I find myself enjoying the whole story and having a connection on the characters. \\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty obvious that I liked this anime. I am not the usual type who watches Slice of Life themed shows and love them this much. I don't usually enjoy them, I just see their capability to entertain a person. Sometimes I sleep halfway through the episodes but in Barakamon, I've never felt any of those. This will be one of my favorite shows of all time. The comedy and plot is timeless. It is something you won't see everyday. \\n\\n\r\nI think the art is Brain's Base's doing. The inconsistent outline somehow managed to astound me even more. Its creative style to add accent to the characters managed to help me enjoy the show even more. The background is as expected, really wonderful and realistic as usual. It pays attention to detail. Also, the coloring they used is usually pastel colors which complements the light-heartedness of this show. \\n\\n\r\nDaisuke Ono's voice acting is probably one of the most interesting parts of this show! I never would've guessed that the serious, sexy, and soothing voice of Ono-sama would match the quirkiness of Handa Seishuu.\\n\\n\r\nYou guys should give this 2014 anime a chance because while there isn't much anime excitement going on last year, I suppose Barakamon can give you a subtle yet captivating impression.",

            "content": "Our surroundings shape us.\r\nBarakamon is a comedy slice of life manga adaptation of the same name. It follows a story of your average shut-in protagonist thrown into an entirely different countryside setting, and how said setting changes him. One of the better actual slice of life shows airing these days, it's not all flowers and daisies but it definitely went the right way.\r\nPlot:\r\nSeishuu Handa, a famous calligrapher gets sent to a remote island after misbehaving in a calligraphy contest. There, he starts learning to adapt to a different lifestyle, while he develops his own new writing style.\r\nThe plot is rather simple and nothing we haven'tseen before - the protagonist winds up in a completely different lifestyle and setting and must learn to adapt to it. The execution is what counts though, and here Barakamon separates itself from other similar titles. The anime took an episodic direction with every episode delivering a different type of slice of life message(s), which all of them together are linked to the main plot element which is Seishuu's new developing calligraphy style. It's effective, but it has problems.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the calligraphy itself didn't have as much influence to the story as actual interactions happening between the characters, and it was sort of pushed to a secondary role until the final couple of episodes, and its appearances, bar from a few, weren't anything you could describe with more than a word \"average\". Second, the actual metaphors and symbolism were sometimes very very forced (for example, like episode 2), and even gave out a pretentious vibe. Most of the slice of life moments in the show were actually slice of life-ish and give lots of food for thought, but as the show progress on you notice that nothing actually happens with all of those moments, as the main character doesn't have any chances to show us what has he learned until the final episodes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nIndividually, the characters are the weakest part of the show. Apart from the protagonist, they all suffer from extreme lack of characterization and development, and are just thrown in there to have numbers and create specific events. Naru was the biggest disappointment of the show, but it wasn't so much of her fault as it was for the other characters that kind of stole the spotlight from her. The first episode was insanely well executed and it only had 2 characters, Naru and Seishuu, driving it forward, and if anime had less characters but more focus on the remaining character views on the world and personalities, it would come out as a much more enjoyable watch. Now, we have a mixture of characters who are basically the same, for example, the children in the show, apart from getting separated by a quirk or two, all act in the same way. They don't have any unique elements to seperate them apart, they don't have any problems specifically tied to them, and are just there for the main character to have funny interactions with them. Same goes for the teenagers, although they have a little bit more traits separating them from each other. Truth be told, they are plot devices.\\n\\n\r\nMoving to a brighter side of the spectrum, we have the main protagonist, Seishuu. He is an extremely generic and cliched character, but receives tons of development as the entire anime is devoted solely to make and show him change. I am not saying that he's a bad character, it's just that he's very uninteresting. We have little to no backstory of him, so we cannot really reflect on it and compare his former, pre-island self to his current self when the anime ends. His rival, Kousuke is another good character and one of the few which are distinctively different from the others. His perspective on the situation stood out and he was definitely a good addition to the cast, fitting into the comedy, but sadly he doesn't receive enough focus.\\n\\n\r\nI felt the main problem of the show is that the learning process is one sided. Everything in the anime just dances around the main protagonist, and the end result is that only Seishuu gets reasonable development. The setting itself didn't change at all and wouldn't even notice if the calligrapher never went on the island. The side cast could have learned from the interactions with their Sensei, but they didn't, and I felt that Naru would be the one but she ends up just like the other characters. It really looks like the anime is basically Seishuu and the plot devices, but luckily enough, because of the amazingly executed situations, we won't remember this show for that.\\n\\n\r\nWriting:\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is where Barakamon goes on full throttle: the character interactions. They are just absolutely amazing. Despite the fact that the characters aren't unique and they all feel like they were tarred with the same brush, their interactions and dialogues with each other are a joy to watch. This was the best element of the show, which also sets up for some hilarious comedy. It doesn't feel monotone or gets repetitive, since there's tons of side cast characters in the show for Seishuu to have funny conversations with, and they differ every time. As a take on the lives of normal countryside folks, this anime is amazing. The atmosphere is portrayed very realistically and it definitely has a significant presence when you are watching the show. None of the elements are explored much though, as they all serve to the protagonist. Fortunately, lack of elaboration is not so much of a problem, because those tiny bits are indeed executed very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy, if it's not through character interactions (teenagers + kids with Seishuu or with each other), can be a hit or miss. Anime sometimes tries to force comedy rather than making it splash through the normal flow, and that is especially evident with some specific characters (fujoshi girl's fujoshi, Seishuu's mom). However, the show executes some natural elements really well and use them to great comedy success, like Naru's katakana reading and children's oblivious nature in general, which fits greatly and works to the atmosphere's advantage. Unlike some of the other \"slice of life\" shows, Barakamon doesn't have any shameless fanservice, and I'm glad that they didn't try to include it with the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing that I would like to mention is how well Barakamon can close its episodes. It feels like there is a climax of epic and cool in each episode right when it's about to end, and you get to listen to the great ED of the show. Unlike shows like Attack On Titan, where it also aims to end the episode on a high note, it doesn't use shock factor or constant cliffhangers.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is rather simple and typical, uses a lot of bright colors to aid the funny and sweet atmosphere of the show to a degree. The character designs are easily distinguishable from each other and everyone looks different enough to select them out right away (sad that they didn't ACT like that aswell). The calligraphy looks nice but that wasn't enough to get me interested in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, while not having so much of rememberance, fits the show well with it's \"happy-go-lucky\" nature. What is great about the sound department is the voice acting. There's so much good to talk about the voice acting that I don't even know where to start. Okay, they actually got kids voicing kids in this show. It feels so real listening to the conversations, they were like a melody to your ears as they also delivered a magnificent performance. And the biggest highlight is the dialect. It made the anime so much better and atmospherical, and was one of the main reasons why dialogues were so well executed and fun to watch. That was an amazing experience, and I'm not exaggerating.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is well, cool. Great music with great visuals. Aids to the atmosphere a lot, and is a great introduction to set you up for the ride. Second best opening to Tokyo Ghoul of the summer 2014 season for me, and I guess there's nothing more to say about it.  The ending, though, is just magnificent. I already talked about how well Barakamon manages to close out the episodes and this is one of the main reasons why. The overall combination is amazing - you have a great opening song to get you in and a great ending song to escort you out.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon is one of the few slice of life titles with actual slice of life. It has an amazing atmosphere - one that will be remembered for a while. Lovable characters, even if they're not explored enough individually, create some very enjoyable situations. The comedy is sometimes forced, but never feels repetitive. Not everything is done right in the show, and it does have execution mistakes here and there, but overall, it is a title I would recommend to watch for everyone, either to examine an interesting take on how surroundings change people, or just to relax yourself after a hard day and enjoy the spectacle.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 6.7/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Barakamon is a slice of life about enjoying the little things of life and, unlike most of its comrades in the genre, is not conformist mediocrity. Everyone knows the premise by now, so allow me to expand a bit on what makes it interesting. \r\nFirst things first, Naru. She is the face of Barakamon, and for all right reasons. Her adorability is over nine thousand, and the voice helped a lot in convincing me she is an actual child. Instead of hiring an adult woman to force her voice, they brought a kid and well, it paid off. Every ounce of her childlike nature andcheerful innocence is expressed beautifully. The verisimilitude of it all captivates even hardcore moe haters. In your face!\\n\\n\r\nHanda on the other hand isn't nearly as charmful. He works more as a receptacle of daily lessons about the joy found in someone else's smile, day to day pranks, meeting with friends to fish, building walls, and all that crap. It never crossed the head of a normative artist who was only concerned about mastering his craft that life is more than just seeking others' approval. That could be applied to anyone living in the big city really. He's a simple character with a simple struggle but it's nonetheless enjoyable seeing him going from point A to point B, and the conclusion for his arc is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nHere is a problem in adapting an on-going manga into a conclusive series. If some characters are introduced in the latter half and get as much focus as characters who had already been there since the beginning, it causes a small whiplash. They are simply not that interesting. They serve a purpose, but they don't belong there. The initial half is episodic and more comedic, the latter is more plot oriented and preoccupied with closing loose threads. There is not much that can be done about it, that is how adaptations often work. I just wish I could see more of lady Fujoshi and all jokes related.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series is pretty above average. It's considerably more fluid than most seasonal anime, and who doesn't like grass, sea, and other rural imagery done right? It's all cozy and breezy, really cool atmosphere. Musically, well, pretty good too. It all fits intended purposes, really. Kinema Citrus is honestly a surprise and deserves all the praise. It produces anime out of nowhere that end up beloved for the right reasons.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly sweet and convincing, blending well adult apprehension with all warm feelings and fun, a near adventure through the psyche of an asshole exposed to nice people. A therapeutic experience with a nice pleasant aftertaste. If you ain't traveling to get inspired, watch Barakamon to get joyful.",

One of the main objectives of a Slice of Life genre is delivering a straight message of life itself. And Barakamon is a great example to prove that.\r\nBarakamon begins with a small plot. A small plot that circles Barakamon is not giving the anime a weakness, but it give the story a power to weighted the story itself. One of thereasons why is because the premise of the story. The premise really represents the true feeling of the story.\\n\r\nThe story makes all of the genre (including Shounen and Magic) speechless with no words in the brain, it's really fresh your mind.\\n\\n\r\nFor a modern anime, Barakamon has a beautiful animation, a magnificent light, and a unique character design makes the art is one of my favorite. The animation is well-matched within the story.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing we must notice in the sound settings is the Opening song, \"Rashisa\" sung by SUPER BEAVER is really makes a reflection to myself, the feelings of the song is delivered successfully within my heart. While the background music is quite decent, the seiyuu did a very good job in bringing such feelings to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nAs we can see, the massive character development that occurs is a center in our main character, Handa Seishuu. As the other character, there is a simplistic but unique character division on display, surely it is a great character division.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Barakamon a lot, it's successfully charming my harsh feeling into a mild feeling. It's quite memorable and full of excitement that occurs in the story. It is highly recommended for a simple Slice of Life fans.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Barakamon is another great show that succeeds in the feelings and excitement in the story, by the way (this is the first time I threw a 9 in my review...).

            "content": "Well, my review got deleted for not following the guidelines so I uploaded it. ~\r\nBarakamon, a funny, relaxing, slice of life anime that's overshadowed by other popular anime that are airing alongside it, such as SAO II, Aldnoah Zero, Akame Ga Kill, Tokyo Ghoul and Zankyou no Terror. If you want to get a relief from all these popular action-packed, horror anime then you should definitely check Barakamon out. With that said, it's an anime that everyone can enjoy.\r\nThe story is basically about Handa Seishu, a calligrapher who thinks that he's the best at whatever he does, and therefore is very hard to socialize with.At one competition, the exhibit hall director tells him that his art is mediocre, and Handa, being the arrogant perfectionist that he is, punches the director right in the face. After the incident, Handa's dad, disappointed in his son, sends Handa over to an unknown island where he's supposed to \"cool off\". Once he moves into his new house, and meets with all his future neighbors, he finds out things about his new surroundings... funny things. The best thing being Naru, the super cuddly adorable girl that she is, scares and annoys Handa daily by living in Handa's house (it's her \"secret base\"). As time passes Handa and Naru's develop a little friendship which leads to the absolute happy and funny feeling to the anime. But even more than the friendship, the beauty of nature is shown on the anime, and as Naru and Handa look at the sunset, the beautiful forests filled with beautiful flowers, staring into the glamorous bodies of water surrounding the island, my heart simply melts of happiness. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are absolutely fantastic! They are so different from the usual stereotypical characters you see in other shows, and they have so much personality it always gets to me emotionally, either in a happy or sad way. Handa, despite being a arrogant perfectionist has a heart that he just doesn't want to show. Handa shows care and compassion for not only his art, but also for the other characters whom he befriends, especially Naru. Speaking of Naru, have I mentioned how adorable and hilarious this girl is? Just everything about her makes me happy! I wish she was my little sister!! We could have so much fun together!! Anyways, Handa and Naru are literally perfect for eachother! No, not in a romantic relationship way, but in a friendship way. Handa can teach Naru how to actually use her brain, since Naru is very clumsy and doesn't seem to know anything. But on the other hand, because of Handa's unfriendly personality, he doesn't have any friends... Upon reaching the island Handa finally realizes that all of his focus on art had brought him to miss the beauty of life/nature, and his super new friend, Naru will help Handa find his way. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is awesome, it's quite \"cutesy\" and I heard that the the producers kept the style very close to the manga. The art was simply a treat to watch, especially the sunset and the beautiful water shining before my eyes. Seriously the art, it just makes everything that much more funny and it mixes very well with how a scene is meant to be portrayed. I never really focused on the music, but I can tell you two things. First of all the Barakamon opening is my favorite opening of this season, which is saying something. And to add on to that, the voice cast matches each character's appearance. ESPECIALLY NARU!! Naru's voice is simply adorable, and I love her!!\\n\\n\r\nI'm just going to wrap up my first review by saying: watch it at least for Naru!! So Kawaii!",

            "content": "Without a doubt, Barakamon is one of the most relaxing anime out there in existence. If I had to describe Barakamon in short, it would be that it has been, a true panacea. \r\nBarakamon's story isn't anything groundbreaking or intricate, in fact, it is the authentic simplicity of the show, that truly permits one to adore this show to its utmost. With a soothing atmosphere and a refreshing cast of characters, Barakamon is one of those shows that rewards anyone from an arduous day of work. \r\nThe story revolves around Handa Seishuu, a young and enthusiastic calligrapher with pride and talent. Despite this, after havinghis worked criticised against him, he punches and old man, and thus, has been exiled to a rural country-side island to take some time off and reflect from his actions.\\n\\n\r\nTransformation, no, it is not transformation that Handa receives throughout his time here, but rather, it is the collective experience and memories forged on the island with the villagers that truly allow Handa to grow not only as a calligrapher, but as a human being. \\n\\n\r\nBarakamon is very subtle and implicit in portraying its underlying messages, and although the change of Handa is not colossal, it is the journey itself and the time spent on the island that tackles and exhibits the implied themes of resilience, hospitality and companionship. \\n\\n\r\nNaru is a noisy, boyish and talkative 7 year-old girl who accompanies Handa throughout the majority of the time and is another vital asset to the cast of the show. A lot of the show's comedy and humour derives off from Naru and her comical behavior and actions, making her an essential character in the series. What makes her so enticing and adorable is her infinite amounts of energy, as well as the content and cheerful atmosphere she emits. She finds almost anything, and everything hilarious and her relationship with Handa, somewhat subtly resembles a father and daughter relationship - bittersweet, beautiful and irreplaceable.  \\n\\n\r\nBarakamon also has a large cast of supporting characters as it encompasses the villagers from the island, and does a great job in fusing infants, children, teenagers, adults, and even the elderly in one whole setting - an embodiment of a bonded family. The villagers don't just feel like people from a village, but instead, people from a large family who bear a variety of personalities and care for each other. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the music, the outgoing opening song 'Rashisa' by Super Beaver immediately sets off with a lively atmosphere as the show begins, and puts the audience at ease and relaxation. The ending song 'Innocence' by NoisyCell is indeed amazing, a great way of ending each episode with a heartwarming feeling and soothing sensation it emits. Both pieces are undoubtedly superb choices of music and fits the show perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nNot just the music, but Handa's voice actor, Ono Daisuke, does a phenomenal job in depicting Handa's emotions and has a great versatile voice, being able to elicit sympathy in the more sentimental and emotional scenes, bring out humour though a sarcastic manner of speech, and is also capable of conveying a frustrated tone of voice when required. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the art, in all honesty, although it is nothing groundbreaking or extremely well-animated, it does not hinder the enjoyment or presentation of the show at all as it is after-all, a slice of life comedy show. The art itself, is intrinsically compelling to begin with and is consistent throughout, definitely suiting the rural setting of the show and develops a heartwarming feeling to the viewers. \\n\\n\r\nIf there's something I did not expect from Barakamon, it would be the laughs it has given to me constantly, and with great voice acting, this comedy is enhanced to a whole new level. In Barakamon, even the tiniest of the most trivial of things can make you laugh, and make Naru roll on the floor laughing in tears. It's the things that these characters do and their reactions that allow us to adore them and laugh alongside.\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon is an equilibrium between humour and emotion, none outclasses the other and they are both perfectly portrayed. One can argue that the world of calligraphy and its industry could have been explored more profoundly, but as a slice of life comedy and heartwarming series that focuses on its experiences, moments and its subtle themes more than a concrete and complex story, this show certainly has exceeded my expectations and comes out as a triumphant gem - and it's shows like these that I truly have no regrets in watching, and will definitely hope to see more in the future of anime.",

            "content": "Often, the slice-of-life genre is viewed as what is more or less the Seinfeld genre of anime - that they are \"shows about nothing.\" This is by no means a bad thing - shows like Non Non Biyori to a stellar job of proving that a show about the most inane daily activities can be greatly entertaining and sometimes even emotional. But that is also no excuse to produce SoL shows that have no true plot or character development. And that's where Barakamon comes in.\r\nBarakamon is, at its core, the story of a calligrapher named Seishuu Handa, and his interactions with the people around him.It's this character, and his development over the course of the story that I'm going to focus on in this review, because it's the heart and soul of the show. Seishuu is impulsive, childish, insecure, and generally immature, and this results in a number of problems arising in his life. The main one being his assault of an elderly calligraphy exhibit director who insults his work, which in turn gets him sent to the island on which 90% of the show takes place. From there, it turns into fairly standard SoL material, chronicling his interactions with the islanders over the course of each episode. But this is where Barakamon deviates from the average slice of life: in each episode, you can see a small part of Seishuu's immaturity slip away, and there is visible growth episode-to-episode for his character. In fact, his development is so critical that there are no other characters that change very drastically from the beginning of the show to the end - because they don't NEED to. Even the children on the island are, often, more mature and reasonable than the main character, which creates an interesting dynamic, especially in the case of Naru Kotoishi, Seishuu's young and tomboyish foil. The story maintains a wonderful sense of progression through Seishuu's character development, and his interactions with the other characters change noticeably over the course of the show, so that by the end there is a visibly more mature air to Seishuu and his character as a whole (although he retains more than a little impulsiveness).\\n\\n\r\nAside from the focus on the main character's development, there are other aspects of the show worth mentioning: Kinema Citrus does a remarkable job with the animation, and there are few moments in the show that aren't downright gorgeous to look at. The opening and ending themes are some of the best of the season, and the rest of the soundtrack rests comfortably in the background, providing mood music for each scene. The comedy is consistently good, and is interspersed comfortably throughout each episode to provide humor around every turn. One thing in particular I'd like to mention is Suzuko Hara's performance as Naru. Not only is it rare to see children voiced by children in anime, it's rarer still to find someone this good in their first performance. She lends a warmth and genuine kindness to the character that is hard to find anymore.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is really the last section here worth mentioning, and for me was high throughout the show. Each episode was strong all the way through, it delivered a good story and development while blending in the comfortable and familiar elements of the slice of life genre. If I had to come up with a metaphor to describe this show, I think I would say: Barakamon is like a cup of good hot tea - sometimes sweet, sometimes bitter, but always enjoyable, with a familiar and cheery feeling that warms the soul and leaves you wanting another glass (or episode, as it were).\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict: 10/10, one of the best shows of the Summer 2014 Season.",

            "content": "Growing up, spur of the moment family gatherings were some of my most cherished memories. The thick, summer air is palpable. Echoes of children giggling and playing in the distance reach the ear, soothing your mind and your shoulders slink down as all sense of stress and worry fade into nothingness. There\u2019s no distraction, no urgency, just an honest and accepting accompaniment by some of your favorite people in the world. Endearments are swapped by friends and family alike, and the atmosphere transforms more and more into one of constant comfortability. We all have those people in our lives whose presence brings up the entiregroup\u2019s spirits, resulting in jovial and lighthearted conversation. It\u2019s particular situations like this that we wish were able to be wrapped up nice and neat and placed on a shelf for eternity. \\n\\n\r\nThis is exactly the same feeling I get from watching Barakamon.\\n\\n\r\nReleased in one of anime\u2019s densest years (2014), Barakamon broke the edgy, action-laden status quo of modern anime with a wholesome, endearing tale of a world-renowned calligrapher sent to rural Japan to do some soul-searching. Produced by up-and-coming Studio Kinema Citrus (Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Black Bullet), Barakamon has a unique charm that can only be explained by a first hand experience. It works the senses and warms the heart more than any anime I can remember, leaving the viewer with a completeness unrivaled in the medium. For someone who has been consistently disappointed by Slice-of-Life anime, I was initially guarded in my openness to the series. However, in the following paragraphs, I hope to instill the same fondness of the series I have unto my readers, and finally divulge the reasons why Barakamon is one of my Top 10 favorite anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon at its core is a story of self-reflection and redemption. Seishuu Handa is an accomplished professional calligrapher, whose robotic method of artwork was both revered and criticized, depending on the individual. He always strives for perfection, but as a result is very self-deprecating and has a rather low sense of confidence. One instance of this criticism occurred on perhaps calligraphy\u2019s biggest stage, the Eika Prize Award reception. Upon receiving an insult from the Director himself over the lack of originality in his work, Seishuu reactively hurls his fist at him, resulting in public shame and discredibility. In an effort to cool down, Seishuu relocates the rural Goto where he meets the village scamp Naru, and learns the true meaning of happiness while discovering his instinctual nature as a calligrapher. \\n\\n\r\nThere aren\u2019t any shocking or overly-intellectual moments in Barakamon. Seishuu doesn\u2019t transform into an unrecognizable version of his former self by the end of the anime. Nor do the writers subvert their own formula by erratically dousing the viewers with fanservice. Barakamon tells us its story simply through atmosphere and character interaction. There aren\u2019t any convenient narrations or expositions of emotional text from characters to describe the feeling for a given scene. It allows us as viewers to take a step back and observe, rather than always trying to stay one step ahead of the story. Thematically speaking, everything is brought up very subtly. The anime also has little to actually do with calligraphy, but uses it as a vessel to help explain the magnitude of emotional growth Seishuu experiences through the series. Whether it\u2019s a fishing competition, hospital visit or just lounging around with some of your favorite people, Barakamon shows us joy in the simple things. Sometimes taking the time to relax and enjoy the company of others can really help put the world into perspective. \\n\\n\r\nMuch like the subtlety of the show\u2019s themes, the comedy sneaks up on you. It upholds some sense of purity in its presentation. There is no over-the-top gags here, no indecipherable cultural references and the slapstick comedy is realistic as opposed to exaggeratory (sans the ridiculously drawn Naru faces. My favorite moments were the mortified reactions by Seishuu when a various member of the cast would do something out of the ordinary. He was often left confused or awestruck with more commonplace actions from the locals. The result is that Barakamon helps bridge the gap between a city-minded viewer and a country-minded one by slapping the two cultural opposites together into one package. Subsequently, this adds relatability to its repertoire, something that a Slice-of-Life thrives on. The charming humor places the viewer right in the center of the story, as an observant fly on the wall. \\n\\n\r\nAs someone who grew up in a very urban area, I can relate on a certain level to the foreignness that Seishuu experiences when first arriving in Goto. He\u2019s an introvert, relying on his narrowed skill to speak for him rather than actually doing it himself. Everything is upended when he\u2019s ripped out of his shell and planted in a rural setting, where conversing socially is a regularity. His interaction with the cast throughout the rest of the series is a beaming indicator of his true personality. Seishuu is actually quite immature, making his conversations with Naru and her younger friends natural. Naru helps him to emerge from his closed-off nature by placing him in some rather precarious scenarios along the way, much to Seishuu\u2019s immediate objections. Each heartwarming scene that passes only strengthens the sense of relatability in our protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nNaru is quite possibly the glue that holds Barakamon together. Her mannerisms, disposition and interactions with Seishuu and the rest of the cast radiate with innocence and likability. The best part? She\u2019s voiced by an actual child. Kinema Citrus really did their homework when it came to assembling the seiyuu\u2019s for Barakamon. Not only does the high-pitched, airy voice add to the realism, it also sounds more soothing to the ear instead of a forced inflection put on by an adult. Naru and the rest of the cast of kids act their age in this anime, instead of presenting the facade of a 13 year old mature enough to rule the world as in most anime out there today. They easily cry when upset, and they find joy and contentment in some of the most trivial activities. Their personalities were extraordinarily refreshing to see, adding some legitimacy along the way. One aspect of the cast one may find less than stellar is the character development. There really aren\u2019t any defining examples of it anywhere outside of Seishuu. Despite this negative, I can\u2019t say that it actually deterred from the anime in any way. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the animators won\u2019t win any awards for outstanding achievement in art, I can say that the style fit Barakamon very well. Flourishes of bright hues calm the viewers into an almost lucid, dreamlike state. Colors are slightly washed out, leaving the characters and their interactions to become the focal point of the anime. Some of the more comedic scenes involving a various roulette of character faces were downright hilarious, and I give full marks for creativity in that department. The character models are attractive, and the children are cute, with their oversized heads and lanky appendages. \\n\\n\r\nFrom a sound perspective, I have little to no complaints. The OP, \u201cRashisa\u201d is lively and works to tell a story of its own, showing the pesky Naru infiltrating Seishuu\u2019s house and causing her usually adorable mischief. If you ever get a chance to download the full version of this song, it includes the infamous scene of the Goto villagers calling Seishuu after he makes his way back to the city. Let\u2019s just say, it made a few tears well up in my eyes\u2026 The ED is equally as fitting, and offers a fluid wrap up of each of Barakamon\u2019s 12 episodes. When present, the background themes are jolly and catchy, sprucing up the accompanied scene. This is one of the few anime I actually downloaded the OST for, though whether for nostalgia or quality reasons I\u2019m really not sure. Lastly, is the outstanding performance of Barakamon\u2019s cast of voice actors. Suzuko Hara is unequivocally charming as Naru, and her performance should serve as a beacon for other producers to follow when casting child roles in anime. The same could be said for Rina Endou (Hina), as she\u2019s enjoyed continued fitting roles, like the lovable Tsumugi from Amaama to Inazuma.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, as subjective as it may be, is the one factor that keeps anime fans coming back for more. This is the primary reason why I weight it heavier than any other category when scoring a review. Barakamon was chocked full of endearing moments, and had one of the most lighthearted, engrossing atmospheres I\u2019ve ever experienced in an anime. It just hit home for me on so many levels. Couple this with the well-crafted cast and corresponding soundtrack, and this anime becomes an instant classic. I think many viewers or critics come into Barakamon with preconceived notions of what it should be, and may come away unfulfilled. This anime doesn\u2019t do much, but what it does do is done so subtly, yet brilliantly that it\u2019s hard to put into words. I recommend this series to fans of anime like Usagi Drop, the aforementioned Amaama to Inazuma, or those who want an engrossing, feel-good show without high stakes or overthought plotlines. Thank you to all who took the time to read this review, and be sure to check out some of my other work!       \\n\\n\r\nStory-8\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nCharacters-8\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nOverall-9.0",

            "content": "\u201cThe other thing is surrounding yourself with people that care for you. These are simple things, but they're powerful, and they've completely transformed who I am and how I perceive myself.\u201d - Mariel Hemingway\r\n\u2018Barakamon\u2019 is a rare kind of story. Something that is just so simple, yet so powerful. There are no big expositions of drama and no complicated plotlines, none of that is needed in the slightest. The story is simple, easy to grasp, and beautiful to watch as it plays out. In its purest form, it\u2019s simply the story of an arrogant (but still kind-hearted) young man that simply can\u2019t seem to letgo of his pride, and how he matures from the time he spends with the townsfolk of his new home. \\n\\n\r\nI would be amiss to not mention one thing though: the show is not sappy in the least despite what was just said. Rather, it is hilarious. Every episode is full to the brim with unforced comedy that hits almost every time. It\u2019s amazing how a show so hilarious can also be so heartwarming and display so much character growth without feeling unbalanced at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the driving force behind this show. They steer the comedy and development in the right direction and are all memorable and likable. From wise elderly villagers, all the way to little kids with a seemingly unlimited supply of energy and an unquenchable thirst for adventure. The two most prominent and important characters of this wacky bunch are Handa and Naru.\\n\\n\r\nHanda is the \u201carrogant (but still kind-hearted) young man\u201d talked about earlier. He is a surprisingly layered character in many respects once you come to know him a little bit. You get to see the effects of his slow change over time through his thoughts and expressions \u2013 and eventually through his actions. He\u2019s an all-around great character that is lots of fun to follow, because, despite the fact that he is sometimes a jerk, you can\u2019t help but care about the guy. \\n\\n\r\nAnd there is also Naru. I absolutely love this little ball of fun. She\u2019s cute, she\u2019s clumsy and kind, and out of all the villagers she is the one that impacts Handa the most. Naru takes an indirect role akin to a little sibling with our gruff \u2018jelly bean\u2019 (hard on the outside, soft on the inside) of a main character, and this is where the most consistent change within Handa comes from. Sure, a few events happen that give a big push to his development \u2013 but Naru is definitely the one who changes him most. And aside from her very subtle plot significance, she\u2019s a fantastic character who brings a lot of fun, warmth and smiles.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for everyone was great. Ono Daisuke did a great job portraying Handa, and Hara Suzuko, the little girl who voices Naru, did a fantastic job for only being nine years old. She had to make it sound natural, but also give it a slight comedic edge at times, which is harder than you might think. \\n\\n\r\nAs for music, they used it in a very efficient and subtle manner. The backing tracks are mostly light scores \u2013 fitting the mood and tone of the series. They only occasionally go bombastic, and only at times in which that style of music works for the current scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is solid too. It\u2019s high quality, bright, full of life and gorgeous. The best example of this is the show\u2019s ED, with glistening watercolors of assorted creams and light browns.\\n\\n\r\nYou may have realized I didn\u2019t say anything negative about this anime \u2013 not a thing. And that\u2019s really because there\u2019s nothing that I can find that\u2019s wrong with it. It\u2019s extremely simple all-in-all, and all its simple facets are amazingly put together. I have no gripes or even any nitpicks. What we got with this anime is amazing \u2013 and I wouldn\u2019t change any of it. \\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t believe me? Watch it for yourself and decide. Not everyone will like this as much as I did. A few may not like it at all, and that\u2019s fine. But this is one series that everyone should give a chance to.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime is one of the best I've seen in recent history. The story, though simple, is heartwarming in the truest form. The episodes are mostly day-to-day adventures, but each one is clever, uplifting, and very often hilarious.\r\nThe regular animation is nice in and of itself, but I gave it a 9 for two reasons. Firstly, as calligraphy is a central part of the plot, it obviously has to show up on screen from time to time. The creators did an excellent job of designing  beautiful calligraphy that is just is amazing animated as in real life. Secondly, the ED is just plain andsimply gorgeous. It's done in a watercolor style that you can just watch in awe.\\n\\n\r\nThat reminds me. The OP has a song that gives me chills just from how heartwarming it is. As for the voice acting, Daisuke Ono is awesome, as usual. His character is funny, cute, and really enjoyable. Though who I give the most praise to is Suzuko Hara, the real little girl who voices Naru. She does an amazing job acting, but with all the real emotions of being a kid.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are fun and really developed. And while most shows don't fully capture everything that is childhood, this hits it spot-on. Every character , kid or otherwise, has their own little quirks and personalities. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, this anime was overall really fun to watch. I loved every episode and was sad when I finally finished it.",

            "content": "\"More than what meets the eye\"\r\nAfter reading the synopsis, I was quite hesitant to start Barakamon. I thought for sure i wouldn't find something like a calligraphy focused anime interesting. Boy i was wrong, i definitely could not have been more wrong.\r\n|Objective Review|\r\n|Story/Plot|\r\nCalligraphy, something that seems a bit boring at first. However, Barakamon makes you realize the meaning and depth behind it. It shows off the passion and emotions behind such works. The anime progresses at a great pace, maintaining the interest of the viewers. \r\nThe focus is evenly distributed to all aspects of the anime. We get a deep look at calligraphy, the characters,the village. Barakamon really keeps things fresh and varied until the very end. \\n\r\nThe story as a whole is very solid. The main story line nothing outstanding (finding the lost inspiration), but since it's so well worked out, it gives a solid foundation for the anime. It has a beginning, a great development, and a spectacular finish. A beautifully arched story-line that doesn't lose focus of what it wants.\\n\r\nStory Score - 9\\n\\n\r\n|Slice of life|\\n\r\nWhat can i say, even I who has the emotions of a small rock at the bottom of the ocean got inspired by this heart warming story of a lost man trying to find his path and personal touch in his life and career. A great message supported by pillar morals like friends, family and listening to your heart. What keeps it outstanding from other animes, is how it connects all these messages to calligraphy. The two really work well together.\\n\\n\r\n|Comedy|\\n\r\nI was honestly not expecting too much comedy, but it was a very pleasant surprise. All the jokes and fun times were natural, nothing forced. It all came so naturally, nothing of the usual cliches. Barakamon utilized the forms of comedy to perfection, varying situational, environmental and verbal jokes. It really complemented the laid-back and relaxed ambiance of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n|Characters|\\n\r\nWonderful character choices. It's all natural. None of them are forced characters, they are rather someone who you can encounter easily in real life. There are no extreme characters, yet they are still so unique and different. As far as character development goes, we shouldn't look at the individual characters, but rather how they evolve as a big family. Obviously, the main characters get their fair share of character development, but it's really the community that grabs the attention of the viewer.\\n\r\nCharacter Score - 9\\n\\n\r\n|Art|\\n\r\nBeing a somewhat art related anime, the visuals do deliver as expected. I was pleasantly surprised by how consistent it was.\\n\r\nArt Score - 8\\n\\n\r\n|Sound|\\n\r\nThe voice acting was super fun and cute. They really out-did themselves this time. The soundtracks go well with the scenes and the opening was especially nice for me.\\n\r\nSound Score - 7\\n\\n\r\n|The whole package|\\n\r\nAs i have already mentioned, this anime is much more than what meets the eye. If you want to run away from the stressful city life like Seishuu Handa did, and just relax, get inspiration, warm up you heart or perhaps just to get a good laugh, then this anime is surely for you.\\n\r\nOverall score - 9\\n\\n\r\n|Subjective Review| (SPOILER alert)\\n\r\nBoy oh boy. First of all, i loved all of their characters so much.  Fun, laid back and cute. Just the right people for me. But what really got me is when Handa went back to Tokyo and had a talk with his mom about going back to the village. The fact that he found someplace that he can call home, was just sooo emotional for me. that was For me, who never really got to know a place which i could call home, this really made become a crybaby for at least 20 mins. When he opened the box sent to him, well that totally killed me. I don't thihnk i have ever cried this hard and felt this happy for a fictional character. Due to this, the anime gets a unquestionable 11.\\n\r\nSubjective Score - 11/10",

            "content": "Barakamon\u2026  Ah, the feeling of watching something so laid-back is really refreshing. First thing that came into my mind when I heard Barakamon was, to tell you the truth, Digimon. I\u2019m sorry, I really am! Good thing I was wrong. Phew. * wipes sweat *\r\nAt first I was like, \u201cPshhhh\u2026  Another gorgeous looking guy. I bet this show will target adolescent girls.\u201d But, MIGHTY ZEUS SMITE ME FOR BEING AN INSOLENT FOOL! I am wrong in million ways.\r\nI\u2019ll keep my review short and simple.\r\nStory: 8\r\nHanda Seishu is a 23-year-old calligrapher (most good-looking you\u2019ll ever see). He\u2019s forced to live on a small islandfor hitting a well-known calligrapher. Handa is a shut-in by nature, but he has to live on an island entirely foreign to him. With his new \u201csilly neighbors\u201d who practically trespass his house, invades his privacy, and plays in front of his house, how will Handa handle his situation with these people? You\u2019d know after watching this hilarious comedy. \\n\r\nLaid-back as a sloth, Barakamon\u2019s plot I mean. It\u2019s not a bad thing, at all. In fact, it\u2019s one of Barakamon\u2019s redeeming factors. It can make you smile\u2026 a lot! And the best part, you don\u2019t have to think about any complicated plots. I highly recommend Barakamon if you aren\u2019t looking for any plot-heavy series, but just a plain laid-back and relaxing show that\u2019ll bring you lots of smirks, if not smiles.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nPerfect sceneries and perfectly drawn characters = 9. Not much to say in the art department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\n* sigh * I wish my little sister was this cute? Oh, I\u2019m talking about Naru, an adorable 7-year-old kid who always hangs out and plays with Handa. You can say she\u2019s the most adorable character in the show. Second is Hina, a crybaby who\u2019s always with Naru (also an adorable little human). In short, every single character in the show compliments each other. They fill out each other\u2019s \u201cmissing link\u201d. For an example: Handa\u2019s a pessimist by nature, but almost everyone in the island is a positive thinker, especially Naru. You get it now, ne?\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8\\n\r\n2 songs for a 12 episode show. Opening theme is done by Super Beaver, which I find great. And the Ending theme\u2019s done by NoisyCell titled \u201cInnocence\u201d which is not entirely bad, too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI ENJOYED IT. I ENJOYED IT. I ENJOYED IT. It has been a while since a no-deep-plot show had made me this happy. There\u2019s more to Anime than deep plots, bouncing boobs, sword-fighting, etc. And what\u2019s that? Simplicity\u2014simple things that make us laugh. Sometimes I forgot how something not-so-special show like this could bring a smile to my grumpy-Asian face.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\n9\u2019s a perfect score for me to give to Barakamon. Like I\u2019ve been saying, there\u2019s nothing special with the series. It\u2019s a simple show that can\u2014will make you laugh. It\u2019ll also teach you a thing or two about being mature, I think. \\n\r\nOverall, Barakamon\u2019s been a great show for me. \\n",

The characters are coherent, natural and really lovable. The overall art is great and some scenes are truly astonishing. In term of personal enjoyment, it has been a while since I smiled so much during an anime: the humor of the situations is light and there're a lot of heartwarming scenes. Too short might've been the only flaw but the ending was at a perfect place to stop. It was damn near perfect, imglad I've seen this.",

            "content": "The hype left me hanging... I still want more of Barakamon!\r\nFor a simple series such as this, using nature as an element to pique the watcher's interest is of pure genius indeed. Barakamon, in my opinion, had hidden intentions of giving Japan's tourism faction, most likely the premise of Gotou Islands in Nagasaki, a simple push. But the fact is, my speculation may prove wrong at some end.\r\nBarakamon started with a bang. The first episode, with no further meaningless addition introduces the beautifully depicted countryside. For a young adult who grew up his entire life sheltered in the city, living far from civilization may spellthe end of his calligraphy career. Well, why not? Let's be honest, hierarchy is such a scary thing.\\n\\n\r\nHaving been secluded in a peaceful yet whacky countryside, the protagonist meets the village rascal. For all I know, I end up laughing every time the protagonist ended up being pulled around by the young child. With the addition of the whole antic group, I can assure that every anime watcher can feel and tell that Barakamon is a fresh breath of air among the pile of low-level and generic titles this season.\\n\\n\r\nBut honestly, why does everybody like Barakamon?\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, it is comedy-based. With bratty kids front-lining the show, we who already saw it had it coming that it'll be one where a normal brat lives of the life in the countryside. Freer than the city kids, ignorant of video games, sweat and running, always enjoying the good nature. Even the simplest countryside trivia is affiliated to a light joke that doubles the fun into it. The life at the countryside is like a 360 degree rotated roulette and Barakamon marvelously added spice by using a rowdy youngster group to stir up the events that happened in the show. \\n\\n\r\nSecond, characters. Barakamon credited a colorful cast. With good characters, even the simplest story can be vividly enjoying to the majority and Barakamon justified the fact. With each and every other characters giving contrasts, complementing one another. With a city-grown young man, whose characters are cynical and impulsive. The fun was always new to him since he has been ignorant of the normal fun in his own way. The main fact I thoroughly enjoyed Barakamon is because I enjoyed the company of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThird, the lessons. Like in most anime titles, Barakamon spreads out a lessons to the watchers. \\n\\n\r\n\"Be prudent and at the same live life to the fullest\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is the lesson I got from the series. While it's obvious from the very start, it still never fails to make an impact when I thought of it deeply. Impulses, spur of moments, regrets, despair. One can never avoid such trifles because one meaning of life is to tackle hardships and at the same time, paying respects to each and every other people. Acknowledging mistakes and working up your way even after a hard fall, Barakamon gives the idea that the whole world being unfair is just an exaggeration. Living life to the fullest is still the right way to burn out life.\\n\\n\r\nArt-wise, I believe it still fits the 2014 category. While it strikes me as average in the character department, the scenery department is amazing. I fully enjoyed every part of nature as if I also saw it real-time. \\n\\n\r\nFor the sound department, I am not in any way projecting a rude gesture. but Japs singers had it really tough singing english lyrics so sorry, I found it weird. Same as the OP, it's different from the usual but at the same time, I haven't been much interested on it. Aside the from the opening and ending themes, the bgms are quite good to the ears and were the perfect fit for every frames.\\n\\n\r\nConcluding, Barakamon defines one side of a normalcy far from the city. While it may prove not alluring to some, I, who had a fair share of visiting the countryside comprehends the beauty the show has to offer. Funny, interesting and meaningful are just three simple words I can offer to those who still haven't seen it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Barakamon shows that you don't need aliens, magical powers and love triangles in order to create an exciting anime. Barakamon is not a tale of good triumphing over evil or a couple finding true love within one another, but rather an example of why our uneventful daily lives is story enough, even if said life involves being assaulted by small children. \r\nThere isn't a great deal that occurs in Barakamon's regrettably short 12-episode run. There is no overarching, deep story to keep you on the edge of your seat, and by the end of the final episode, not a whole lot has changed from thebeginning. If you were to explain the story of Barakamon to one of your friends, they would likely respond by saying \"That's it? Sounds boring.\" And they would be horribly wrong, as Barakamon is easily one of the best anime of the entire year.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Barakamon are the story. It is about Handa Seishuu, a 23-year-old calligrapher prone to anger and misfortune, and his friendship with the villagers who continually screw him over through a myriad of hilarious accidents. He does not undergo a great transformation by the end of the anime, but simply experiences the joy of human companionship, and no-- this theme is not told through preaching morals. Barakamon is very subtle with its themes, choosing instead to develop characters gradually and believably rather than through melodrama. As immature as Handa and the characters often are, Barakamon is actually a surprisingly mature anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Handa finds himself staring in awe at the starry night, the writers do not feel the need to explain what Handa is feeling at that moment. At that point in the story, Handa has been characterised so believably that empathising with his thoughts and feelings becomes natural. He's not a walking gag, an archetype made to appeal to the audience's most basic instincts. He is his own person, highly flawed and vulnerable to mistakes. Whereas most anime protagonists are so dull, so devoid of personality or history that you could throw them into just about any other show, Handa feels at home in his own series. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the same can be said for all the other characters. The kids, especially Naru in particular, are unique in the way that they actually behave like kids. Naru is mouthy, aggressive and intellectually inferior to the adults. She collects bugs, finds poop funny, eats live snails (ugh!) and annoys Handa in just about every way possible. Naru is not cute in the same way that loli characters are. She is an actual child, not a pretend-child created to please the nether regions of lolicons. Just like real, living kids, Naru and her companions are often frustrating and bring ruin to just about everything they encounter, but that energy is precisely what makes them so endearing. \\n\\n\r\nThe humour of Barakamon is also surprisingly thoughtful, and it hits the mark more than perhaps could ever be expected from an anime. There were no moments where the joke fell completely flat (as was sometimes the case with similar anime like Silver Spoon and Gekkan Shoujo). There are few, if any puns and stereotypical Japanese humour, even if it does still follow the typical manzai format of stupid-thing-happens-and-people-react-to-stupid-thing. The stupid things in Barakamon work because they are actually rooted in reality. It doesn't create its comedy through the characters reacting in some ridiculous, unbelievable way, but through the kinds of accidents that typically follow from playing with children. And from Handa suffering. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike most slice-of-life comedies, Barakamon knows how to strike a perfect balance between its humour and the more heart-warming moments. These moments are well-placed and purposely kept rare so that they may carry meaning. What most anime are incapable of grasping is that in the real world, we find beauty in between mountains of hardship; it is not something that can be created artificially and sold and traded at the dollar store. Barakamon understands this, which is precisely why its events feel so natural, even if they do not carry any huge wave of emotion along with them. \\n\\n\r\nBarakamon also deserves some praise for its willingness to tell a story with characters of all ages. There are the kids, a few teenagers in the local high school, the adult protagonist and his friends from the city, and the middle-aged and elderly villagers. It does not focus solely on 15-year-olds, and for that Barakamon is all the more special.\\n\\n\r\nThe calligraphy aspect of the show does have its share of issues, though. Because the focus is almost entirely on the comedy and the slice-of-life, there isn't much detail given to the calligraphy world that Handa is a part of. What makes a good piece of writing? What makes a bad one? Why is Handa's new style so much more meaningful, and what is it even like to be a calligrapher? None of these questions are fully answered. If you don't have any knowledge of calligraphy (and I expect you won't-- I certainly did not), then it's likely these scenes will not do much for you. I found myself much more invested in all the immature shenanigans that occurred between Handa and the villagers. At the very least, I suppose it did show that there's a bit more to calligraphy than simply slapping cool-looking kanji on a piece of paper. \\n\\n\r\nBarakamon looks and sounds great. While there's no gorgeous setpieces and scenery to bring heaven to your eyeballs, the artwork is still very attractive and consistent. The opening track is also pure bliss. I would recommend giving it a listen any time you're feeling awful; it's like magic. \\n\\n\r\nWill Barakamon shock and bring you to tears? Probably not. But it will almost assuredly change the opinions of anyone who previously found the slice-of-life genre boring, and what it lacks in emotional value it makes up for by being executed nearly to perfection. It is one of the most enjoyable, pleasant experiences I've had with an anime in a very long time, and anyone who simply wants to have a good time and relax would be doing themselves a huge favour by giving Barakamon a try. Its greatest sin is that there just isn't any more of it to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the best anime of 2014, Barakamon is the winner in my eyes.",

            "content": "Watching Barakamon was like going to a birthday party or a picnic outdoors, chock full of excited children running all over the place, doing what they do best. As an adult (supposedly), you feel slightly out of place but the child in you just wants to jump up and down with them in frantic jubilation without a care in the world. There is a cake too: a black forest with strawberry toppings and as you immerse yourself in the jovial mood, you admit that the feeling of sharing a slice with everyone is sweeter than the cake itself.\r\nAnd what a slice it was!\r\nFor a slice-of-lifeto succeed, it needs to have a decent premise which sets it up and allows it to deliver a constant flow of quality\u2026 well slice-of-lives. For Barakamon, getting the socially inept and awkward \u201ccity-boy\u201d Handa to live in a rural island where the residents are both normal and weird at the same time was the perfect set-up. You can already see it in the first episode. In fact, for me the show stepped up a level in the scene where Handa throws out Naru and she is rolling out going \u201cgyaaaah!\u201d in her lovable and unique accent.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, we follow the life of Seishuu Handa on a place very new and unfamiliar to him: doing some things for the first time, making new friends, enjoying the beauty of nature, picking fights with grade-school kids, catching beetles and going through a plethora of experiences on the island. All the while, he is searching for his own style of calligraphy. I admit that this was the only part of the show that was sort of a miss rather than a hit, for me at least. This stemmed from the fact that I found it impossible to discern the difference of the quality of the works and how Handa\u2019s Calligraphy evolved as the show went on. However, having said that, it is clear that the island life has a profound impact on it: after all, no one can deny the fact that he is inspired by it. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the impressive aspect of the show is the way in which it integrates doses of comedy here and there. In fact, I would say that it is slightly more hilarious than the norm of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show is wonderful. It is laid-back in general but takes longer strides if need be without rushing itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe only rushing in the show is the little Naru rushing to Handa\u2019s house both of whom are totally lovable characters. Handa is surprisingly childish and immature even though he doesn\u2019t realize it which makes it easier for him to connect with the kids and the reactions brought on by his impulsive nature are priceless and hilarious. He is the only one who is significantly developed as the series progresses but that is understandable and okay. \\n\\n\r\nLittle Naru is one of the main allure of the show. She is full of energy and life probably more than a normal 7-year old. You could call her a bit pesky but you would be doing so with a loving smile because her peskiness really helps break down the wall around Handa. Her attachment to Handa is cute indeed and helps their friendship blossom leading to more fun and eventful days for both of them. The only qualm here is that she is not as much developed as a character, even as the show goes on. She, more or less remains the same which is not bad as she is great just the way she is but still one senses a lost potential there.\\n\\n\r\nWithout going into detail about the other characters, it is suffice to say that they are all sufficiently unique and lovable. From a fujoshi in denial to a lively tomboy to a group of cheerful kids, this show has a slightly large cast. Most importantly though, they are all easily likable even if they do suffer from a lack of development which again is understandable as most of the development is focused on Handa. The best part is their interactions which are top-notch and really help carry the show forward. For instance, seeing a grown man being enlightened by 7 year olds complete with his mortified reactions is quite charming and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharming is the right word for the art as well. A good amount of light and vibrant colors have been used. The backgrounds are decently picturesque and the character designs have also been neatly done and are easily distinguishable. I liked how they made the faces of the children slightly chubbier to sort of contrast them to the more \u2018pointed\u2019 ones of the adults. The different facial expressions of the characters especially of the two mains are also impressive and enjoyable. And the animation is also up to par.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, the first tick goes to Naru\u2019s seiyuu who is a kid as well. Actually, kudos to the production team for getting child actors for the roles of those cute kids. Plus, they incorporated a unique dialect for the inhabitants of the island which just adds to the atmosphere and overall feel of the show. The BGM were also decent and as for the opening and ending: although they are not really great, they are slightly better than average. The ending especially managed to stay on my playlist for quite some time and was perfect for the show.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nThis show cannot be recommended enough for those seeking a simple slice-of-life full of smiles and laughs and heartwarming moments. After a long hard day, just get yourself a slice of this cake and enjoy the utter bliss that it is. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Barakamon is a work of art. However, it\u2019s more than just calligraphy as words alone cannot describe the exact nature and discovery of Barakamon. For instance, the show takes place on an island involving a young man named Seishuu Handa. Coming from a more urban based background, his life changes forever as he finds his new life on the natural island of Goto. Of course, this doesn\u2019t happen after he delivers a sucker punch to an elder curator. When someone throws a fit like that, it\u2019s easy to guess that consequences are destined to follow. But can we really call a journey to Goto Islandas a consequence? Perhaps it\u2019s the beginning of a new life for Seishuu Handa. Barakmon explores that new life in this wonderful and charming series that is guaranteed to bring satisfaction through discovery.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the manga written by Satsuki Yoshino, the series has a simple premise. It adapts a slice of life tone hence depicting it like a narrative style with Seishuu as the main protagonist. It\u2019s simple to realize the show has its charm in the beginning with laughter. Seishuu\u2019s exile to Goto Island makes him the new guy in a brand new world. While the setting still takes play in the modern world, the inhabitants and surroundings contrast of what he is used to. For instance, there are no expensive cars or fancy skyscrapers where businessmen work during their workaholic hours. Rather, everything feels natural with a derivative from civilization. In essence, the show is about learning and discovery for Seishuu because he must adapt in this new environment. Now, that\u2019s not a pushover.\u2019\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, the show has the ability to maintain a balanced atmosphere. We see Seishuu and his frustration yet also curiosity on the island. He discovers how simple life yet can be difficult at the same time. It\u2019s a stark contrast to how his former life used to be. And as a master calligrapher, he is all about creation. With that in mind, Barakamon has this mercurial elegance with the style of its characters. Many of its characters live a simple life whether it\u2019s the villagers, neighbors, or kids. They don\u2019t rely solely on advanced technology as evidenced by the old fashioned phones and their way of fishing food. Yet, they also choose to use tools beyond the Amish norm to adapt and survive. For Seishuu, he is like babyface ready to learn everything that needs to be learned.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, there is a noticeable age gap between certain groups. We have kids such as Naru, Miwa, and Tamako. Then, there are others within Seishuu\u2019s age group such as Kazuyuki. It\u2019s certainly an interesting factor to see how Seishuu develop relationships between these characters. Perhaps the most prominent relationship explored throughout the show is Naru and Seishuu. Having over a 15 year age gap doesn\u2019t seem to make the duo compatible to watch at first. However, there\u2019s a certain charm to this relationship as Naru often inspires Seishuu to climb out of his stoic self. Although he is made fun of at first by the kids with nicknames such as \u201cJunon Boy\u201d, there is also a strong attachment between them. In due time, Naru refers him as sensei, as a sign of respect for his brilliant skills in calligraphy. Similarly, Seishuu begins to see the kids in a different light. Despite finding him to be a nuisance, he also learns more from them to adapt with culture. The \u201cnew guy in school\u201d tone has a presence when kids greet him with curiosity. It\u2019s like an escapist adventure for Seishuu rather than a punishment for being exiled. To label it as a consequence could actually be the wrong term since the show offers tons of discovery for Seishuu thanks to his new life. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the strongest aspect of Barakamon is its ability to tell a story without complicated angles such as clich\u00e9 rom-coms or battle shounens. Each episode itself is a story that cleverly show Seishuu\u2019s life rather than tell. Indeed, they also tie in with Seishuu\u2019s calligraphy skill as it plays as an influence throughout the show. Furthermore, the show has a heartwarming atmosphere and innocence. As much as Seishuu is curious about his new surroundings, the kids too are eager to learn. Through Seishu, they learn more about him and essence of the outside life. Remember, these kids are young and wishes to learn beyond school textbooks. With sensei there as a guidance, the kids get a lot out of his presence. It also creates an incalculable attachment as each episode brings them closer in that intimate way. They become like a family, one that in that Barakamonish to the core.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is also wise when it comes down to forming friendships. Seishuu makes friends with other characters including high school students and residents of his own age. Seishuu finds friendship in an authentic way through interactions. Surprisingly enough, some of their skills doesn\u2019t differ from his own. Take for example, 14-year old Tamako Arai\u2019s dream is to become a manga artist. Through her interactions with Seishuu, she is even more inspired to make that dream into a reality. Of course, the show also spice up some comedy between the characters as the kids play him as the fool. It\u2019s what friends do after all. You make jokes, laugh at them, and have fun while doing so. It creates connection in that lighthearted way with realism. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of realism, there\u2019s plenty of that. The show takes place on island so the atmosphere feels natural with energy. The cool breeze and surroundings offers a lavish theater for its backgrounds. Furthermore, it brings about a feeling of escapism for the hardships of civilization such as poverty and crime. In essence, it creates a relaxing setting for our characters to enjoy in. And by standards, most of the characters puts on a smile every day. (perhaps in Seishuu\u2019s case though). They greet activities such as calligraphy, fishing, and swimming with pleasure and enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nComedy is welcoming into the series too without shock values or senseless fan service. Rather, it relies on practical jokes, references, and imaginative tropes to deliver its message. However, the comedy sometimes feels abused when it comes to ideas such as BL; often generated by misunderstandings. It creates a repetitiveness that can be bothering to watch on occasions. Some other gags also quickly becomes old when it\u2019s played over and over. Characterization also isn\u2019t a big strength and feels flat with the younger characters. We only realize their general backgrounds without too much insight on their personalities. Perhaps the show is also a bit too simple as even rivalries (Seishuu and Kanazai) comes off as dull. Indeed, the series doesn\u2019t craft its story thoroughly with plot devices or progression. Instead, it relies on narrative scenarios with the life of Seishuu.\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Kinema Citrus, the show has a very natural taste of its backgrounds. Mountains, rivers, and the neighborhood are structured to look as realistic as it can be. Similarly, characters are crafted out of simplistic designs. The girls doesn\u2019t have heavy makeup nor are the guys decorated with bishounen artistry. They all look who they seem to be with their matching personality. It\u2019s like a breath of fresh air with its realistic character designs. There\u2019s also no fan service or awkward camera angles to raise eyebrows. An added bonus is the calligraphy itself for theme and symbolism of art. It\u2019s downright simple, realistic, and portrays slice of life at its best.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to soundtrack, Barakamon can be dry at times. Yet, it is fluid when you examine it with its conventional music. The OST offers a well-balanced tone with its fashionable soundtrack. The coordination of the music also stands out when it comes with comedic scenes and pacing. Similarly, Seishuu\u2019s voice mannerism is portrayed quite well with his emotions ranging from frustration to joy. I also give praise to voice acting to characters such as Naru and Hina. They talk exactly like kids with their goofy remarks and laughter that inspires a curious LOL moment. The OP and ED songs are decent with unique backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is morbidly gratifying especially if you had one of those tiring day. Its simplicity will take your mind off of life. And speaking of life, we get to see exactly how people live on the island of Goto. For Seishu, it\u2019s entertaining with a handful of new discoveries he finds in his new life. But as a gift for the viewers, you will discover a whole lot more than just an island and its people. You\u2019ll discover an honest show about a colorful cast of characters for their worth. And to be honest, it\u2019s worth it.\\n",

            "content": "One of the hallmarks of a quality slice of life show is its ability to make you forget about the real world and immerse you in their world, if only for a few minutes. You laugh alongside the characters as they do silly things, get anxious as they struggle through trials and tribulations, and then feel relieved when those problems are resolved. Barakamon does an excellent job of accentuating this aspect of the slice of life genre. Through a cast of quirky and unique characters along with simple yet powerful storytelling, Barakamon portrays the life of a man who strives to discover his true identityand style.\\n\\n\r\nHanda Seishuu, a young but promising calligraphy professional, after reacting in an extreme manner to criticism, finds himself whisked away from modern Tokyo to a rural island for a period of reevaluation and reflection. Barakamon tells the story of Handa's time on the island, his interactions with the village folk, and the search for a calligraphy style that he can call his own. With this simple premise, Barakamon delivers a show that is light hearted, comedical, and downright enjoyable to watch. It was nigh impossible to go through a single episode without a big, silly grin all over my face.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom feeling worried for Handa's latest calligraphy contest results to laughing as he attempts to hide his embarrassment due to not knowing how to use a rotary phone, while Barakamon might be a bit slow paced, there is rarely a dull moment. Moreover, although events such as painting the name of a boat onto its hull, or participating in a mochi catching contest may seem to have no deeper meaning other than to define Barakamon as a slice of life, the beautiful aspect of this show is that everything seems to have an underlying meaning or message that helps Handa grow as a person and realize what's important in life. \\n\\n\r\nIt is amazing how much adults can learn from children, despite once being children themselves. Their naive and simple way of thinking and positive outlook can do wonders for an adult struggling with the more mature problems of the world. A change in perspective or a shift in thought process; sometimes that's all you need to overcome the more complex issues in life. In Barakamon, this is very apparent as you watch Naru and the other village children completely change Handa through simple actions and conversations. It was a pleasure to watch Handa transform from a hot headed, close minded, and unsociable person into someone with broad horizons and an open mindset who takes life a little less seriously while enjoying it so much more.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are often what makes or breaks a slice of life show, and Barakamon's cast definitely make the show. From the scrappy and unpredictable ball of energy that is Naru, to the calm and reserved Akki, the wide variety of personalities Handa encounters on the island made the show very spirited and refreshing to watch. We have the troublemaking middle school girl duo of Miwa and Tama who are a riot to watch; Tama with her aspirations of being a mangaka and Miwa, the lovable tomboy who just wants life to be a bit more eventful. Although they tease Handa a whole bunch, at the end of the day they genuinely care for him and they, along with the other children, teach him what it means to care about others. In addition to the people of the village, we have Kawafuji, Handa's constant support from behind the scenes and a childhood friend who always looks out for him, and Kanzaki, a fellow calligrapher who idolizes Handa and serves as his rival and motivation to improve his own calligraphy further. It is amazing how Barakamon's supporting cast of characters all affect Handa in some way, and is one of the reasons Barakamon is an excellent slice of life show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is lively and the animation is a bit rough, but fits the style of the show quite well. The highlights were Naru's eccentric movements and general facial expressions in depressing/hilarious situations. The music was pretty standard slice of life fare; however, the opening and ending in particular were well done and fit the show like a glove. While there is room for improvement in both aspects, there is nothing major to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon delivers a slice of life show that we've been missing for quite some time. With the amount of cute girls doing cute things and moe shows, Barakamon was a much needed breath of fresh air. A cute, endearing, and heartwarming story about a calligrapher who seeks for a style he can call his own, Barakamon is a solid pick up for any slice of life fan.",

All the characters are good, there's no one that i've disliked, and that's pretty difficult in all anime.\r\nThe comedy on Barakamon it's natural, not something forced with stupid jokes, the characters are just funny.

            "content": "Without fail, this anime had me in stitches after hours and hours of watching all the episodes for 2 days. (sorry, I didn't finish it in one because of chores.)  \r\nTruth is, I saw a screenshot of this anime in my profile and I was interested in seeing it. It was a picture of mangas being piled up in a bag. Two of those mangas were my favorites; namely, Soul Eater and Fullmetal Alchemist. I got interested so I looked it up without viewing its synopsis and started seeing it. I was first in distraught when I found out that the first episode tacklesabout a man being in shame after punching a critic who demolished his whole world by saying a very hurtful comment about his calligraphy. I thought that maybe I was viewing this show and making a waste of time and energy. But I decided to give it a shot. \\n\\n\r\nBarakamon has a simple yet a refreshing plot. The MC ventures on a quest to find a peace of his mind and to have an adventure in a certain province that will either help him fail or achieve success in winning the calligraphy contest. It sure does seem boring at first because not all of us just sit and and talk about calligraphy once in a while because we are not at all interested in it. On the other hand, it actually has a deeper meaning to it. Handa (MC), meets a variety of people that gives him food, infuriates him, and somehow gives him ideas. Meanwhile, the MC is still on the verge finding out whether the people in the province serves him as a distraction, inspiration or both. As I go around halfway through the series, I find myself enjoying the whole story and having a connection on the characters. \\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty obvious that I liked this anime. I am not the usual type who watches Slice of Life themed shows and love them this much. I don't usually enjoy them, I just see their capability to entertain a person. Sometimes I sleep halfway through the episodes but in Barakamon, I've never felt any of those. This will be one of my favorite shows of all time. The comedy and plot is timeless. It is something you won't see everyday. \\n\\n\r\nI think the art is Brain's Base's doing. The inconsistent outline somehow managed to astound me even more. Its creative style to add accent to the characters managed to help me enjoy the show even more. The background is as expected, really wonderful and realistic as usual. It pays attention to detail. Also, the coloring they used is usually pastel colors which complements the light-heartedness of this show. \\n\\n\r\nDaisuke Ono's voice acting is probably one of the most interesting parts of this show! I never would've guessed that the serious, sexy, and soothing voice of Ono-sama would match the quirkiness of Handa Seishuu.\\n\\n\r\nYou guys should give this 2014 anime a chance because while there isn't much anime excitement going on last year, I suppose Barakamon can give you a subtle yet captivating impression.",

            "content": "Our surroundings shape us.\r\nBarakamon is a comedy slice of life manga adaptation of the same name. It follows a story of your average shut-in protagonist thrown into an entirely different countryside setting, and how said setting changes him. One of the better actual slice of life shows airing these days, it's not all flowers and daisies but it definitely went the right way.\r\nPlot:\r\nSeishuu Handa, a famous calligrapher gets sent to a remote island after misbehaving in a calligraphy contest. There, he starts learning to adapt to a different lifestyle, while he develops his own new writing style.\r\nThe plot is rather simple and nothing we haven'tseen before - the protagonist winds up in a completely different lifestyle and setting and must learn to adapt to it. The execution is what counts though, and here Barakamon separates itself from other similar titles. The anime took an episodic direction with every episode delivering a different type of slice of life message(s), which all of them together are linked to the main plot element which is Seishuu's new developing calligraphy style. It's effective, but it has problems.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the calligraphy itself didn't have as much influence to the story as actual interactions happening between the characters, and it was sort of pushed to a secondary role until the final couple of episodes, and its appearances, bar from a few, weren't anything you could describe with more than a word \"average\". Second, the actual metaphors and symbolism were sometimes very very forced (for example, like episode 2), and even gave out a pretentious vibe. Most of the slice of life moments in the show were actually slice of life-ish and give lots of food for thought, but as the show progress on you notice that nothing actually happens with all of those moments, as the main character doesn't have any chances to show us what has he learned until the final episodes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nIndividually, the characters are the weakest part of the show. Apart from the protagonist, they all suffer from extreme lack of characterization and development, and are just thrown in there to have numbers and create specific events. Naru was the biggest disappointment of the show, but it wasn't so much of her fault as it was for the other characters that kind of stole the spotlight from her. The first episode was insanely well executed and it only had 2 characters, Naru and Seishuu, driving it forward, and if anime had less characters but more focus on the remaining character views on the world and personalities, it would come out as a much more enjoyable watch. Now, we have a mixture of characters who are basically the same, for example, the children in the show, apart from getting separated by a quirk or two, all act in the same way. They don't have any unique elements to seperate them apart, they don't have any problems specifically tied to them, and are just there for the main character to have funny interactions with them. Same goes for the teenagers, although they have a little bit more traits separating them from each other. Truth be told, they are plot devices.\\n\\n\r\nMoving to a brighter side of the spectrum, we have the main protagonist, Seishuu. He is an extremely generic and cliched character, but receives tons of development as the entire anime is devoted solely to make and show him change. I am not saying that he's a bad character, it's just that he's very uninteresting. We have little to no backstory of him, so we cannot really reflect on it and compare his former, pre-island self to his current self when the anime ends. His rival, Kousuke is another good character and one of the few which are distinctively different from the others. His perspective on the situation stood out and he was definitely a good addition to the cast, fitting into the comedy, but sadly he doesn't receive enough focus.\\n\\n\r\nI felt the main problem of the show is that the learning process is one sided. Everything in the anime just dances around the main protagonist, and the end result is that only Seishuu gets reasonable development. The setting itself didn't change at all and wouldn't even notice if the calligrapher never went on the island. The side cast could have learned from the interactions with their Sensei, but they didn't, and I felt that Naru would be the one but she ends up just like the other characters. It really looks like the anime is basically Seishuu and the plot devices, but luckily enough, because of the amazingly executed situations, we won't remember this show for that.\\n\\n\r\nWriting:\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is where Barakamon goes on full throttle: the character interactions. They are just absolutely amazing. Despite the fact that the characters aren't unique and they all feel like they were tarred with the same brush, their interactions and dialogues with each other are a joy to watch. This was the best element of the show, which also sets up for some hilarious comedy. It doesn't feel monotone or gets repetitive, since there's tons of side cast characters in the show for Seishuu to have funny conversations with, and they differ every time. As a take on the lives of normal countryside folks, this anime is amazing. The atmosphere is portrayed very realistically and it definitely has a significant presence when you are watching the show. None of the elements are explored much though, as they all serve to the protagonist. Fortunately, lack of elaboration is not so much of a problem, because those tiny bits are indeed executed very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy, if it's not through character interactions (teenagers + kids with Seishuu or with each other), can be a hit or miss. Anime sometimes tries to force comedy rather than making it splash through the normal flow, and that is especially evident with some specific characters (fujoshi girl's fujoshi, Seishuu's mom). However, the show executes some natural elements really well and use them to great comedy success, like Naru's katakana reading and children's oblivious nature in general, which fits greatly and works to the atmosphere's advantage. Unlike some of the other \"slice of life\" shows, Barakamon doesn't have any shameless fanservice, and I'm glad that they didn't try to include it with the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing that I would like to mention is how well Barakamon can close its episodes. It feels like there is a climax of epic and cool in each episode right when it's about to end, and you get to listen to the great ED of the show. Unlike shows like Attack On Titan, where it also aims to end the episode on a high note, it doesn't use shock factor or constant cliffhangers.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is rather simple and typical, uses a lot of bright colors to aid the funny and sweet atmosphere of the show to a degree. The character designs are easily distinguishable from each other and everyone looks different enough to select them out right away (sad that they didn't ACT like that aswell). The calligraphy looks nice but that wasn't enough to get me interested in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, while not having so much of rememberance, fits the show well with it's \"happy-go-lucky\" nature. What is great about the sound department is the voice acting. There's so much good to talk about the voice acting that I don't even know where to start. Okay, they actually got kids voicing kids in this show. It feels so real listening to the conversations, they were like a melody to your ears as they also delivered a magnificent performance. And the biggest highlight is the dialect. It made the anime so much better and atmospherical, and was one of the main reasons why dialogues were so well executed and fun to watch. That was an amazing experience, and I'm not exaggerating.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is well, cool. Great music with great visuals. Aids to the atmosphere a lot, and is a great introduction to set you up for the ride. Second best opening to Tokyo Ghoul of the summer 2014 season for me, and I guess there's nothing more to say about it.  The ending, though, is just magnificent. I already talked about how well Barakamon manages to close out the episodes and this is one of the main reasons why. The overall combination is amazing - you have a great opening song to get you in and a great ending song to escort you out.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon is one of the few slice of life titles with actual slice of life. It has an amazing atmosphere - one that will be remembered for a while. Lovable characters, even if they're not explored enough individually, create some very enjoyable situations. The comedy is sometimes forced, but never feels repetitive. Not everything is done right in the show, and it does have execution mistakes here and there, but overall, it is a title I would recommend to watch for everyone, either to examine an interesting take on how surroundings change people, or just to relax yourself after a hard day and enjoy the spectacle.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 6.7/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Barakamon is a slice of life about enjoying the little things of life and, unlike most of its comrades in the genre, is not conformist mediocrity. Everyone knows the premise by now, so allow me to expand a bit on what makes it interesting. \r\nFirst things first, Naru. She is the face of Barakamon, and for all right reasons. Her adorability is over nine thousand, and the voice helped a lot in convincing me she is an actual child. Instead of hiring an adult woman to force her voice, they brought a kid and well, it paid off. Every ounce of her childlike nature andcheerful innocence is expressed beautifully. The verisimilitude of it all captivates even hardcore moe haters. In your face!\\n\\n\r\nHanda on the other hand isn't nearly as charmful. He works more as a receptacle of daily lessons about the joy found in someone else's smile, day to day pranks, meeting with friends to fish, building walls, and all that crap. It never crossed the head of a normative artist who was only concerned about mastering his craft that life is more than just seeking others' approval. That could be applied to anyone living in the big city really. He's a simple character with a simple struggle but it's nonetheless enjoyable seeing him going from point A to point B, and the conclusion for his arc is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nHere is a problem in adapting an on-going manga into a conclusive series. If some characters are introduced in the latter half and get as much focus as characters who had already been there since the beginning, it causes a small whiplash. They are simply not that interesting. They serve a purpose, but they don't belong there. The initial half is episodic and more comedic, the latter is more plot oriented and preoccupied with closing loose threads. There is not much that can be done about it, that is how adaptations often work. I just wish I could see more of lady Fujoshi and all jokes related.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series is pretty above average. It's considerably more fluid than most seasonal anime, and who doesn't like grass, sea, and other rural imagery done right? It's all cozy and breezy, really cool atmosphere. Musically, well, pretty good too. It all fits intended purposes, really. Kinema Citrus is honestly a surprise and deserves all the praise. It produces anime out of nowhere that end up beloved for the right reasons.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly sweet and convincing, blending well adult apprehension with all warm feelings and fun, a near adventure through the psyche of an asshole exposed to nice people. A therapeutic experience with a nice pleasant aftertaste. If you ain't traveling to get inspired, watch Barakamon to get joyful.",

One of the main objectives of a Slice of Life genre is delivering a straight message of life itself. And Barakamon is a great example to prove that.\r\nBarakamon begins with a small plot. A small plot that circles Barakamon is not giving the anime a weakness, but it give the story a power to weighted the story itself. One of thereasons why is because the premise of the story. The premise really represents the true feeling of the story.\\n\r\nThe story makes all of the genre (including Shounen and Magic) speechless with no words in the brain, it's really fresh your mind.\\n\\n\r\nFor a modern anime, Barakamon has a beautiful animation, a magnificent light, and a unique character design makes the art is one of my favorite. The animation is well-matched within the story.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing we must notice in the sound settings is the Opening song, \"Rashisa\" sung by SUPER BEAVER is really makes a reflection to myself, the feelings of the song is delivered successfully within my heart. While the background music is quite decent, the seiyuu did a very good job in bringing such feelings to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nAs we can see, the massive character development that occurs is a center in our main character, Handa Seishuu. As the other character, there is a simplistic but unique character division on display, surely it is a great character division.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Barakamon a lot, it's successfully charming my harsh feeling into a mild feeling. It's quite memorable and full of excitement that occurs in the story. It is highly recommended for a simple Slice of Life fans.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Barakamon is another great show that succeeds in the feelings and excitement in the story, by the way (this is the first time I threw a 9 in my review...). Trust me, it works...",

            "content": "Well, my review got deleted for not following the guidelines so I uploaded it. ~\r\nBarakamon, a funny, relaxing, slice of life anime that's overshadowed by other popular anime that are airing alongside it, such as SAO II, Aldnoah Zero, Akame Ga Kill, Tokyo Ghoul and Zankyou no Terror. If you want to get a relief from all these popular action-packed, horror anime then you should definitely check Barakamon out. With that said, it's an anime that everyone can enjoy.\r\nThe story is basically about Handa Seishu, a calligrapher who thinks that he's the best at whatever he does, and therefore is very hard to socialize with.At one competition, the exhibit hall director tells him that his art is mediocre, and Handa, being the arrogant perfectionist that he is, punches the director right in the face. After the incident, Handa's dad, disappointed in his son, sends Handa over to an unknown island where he's supposed to \"cool off\". Once he moves into his new house, and meets with all his future neighbors, he finds out things about his new surroundings... funny things. The best thing being Naru, the super cuddly adorable girl that she is, scares and annoys Handa daily by living in Handa's house (it's her \"secret base\"). As time passes Handa and Naru's develop a little friendship which leads to the absolute happy and funny feeling to the anime. But even more than the friendship, the beauty of nature is shown on the anime, and as Naru and Handa look at the sunset, the beautiful forests filled with beautiful flowers, staring into the glamorous bodies of water surrounding the island, my heart simply melts of happiness. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are absolutely fantastic! They are so different from the usual stereotypical characters you see in other shows, and they have so much personality it always gets to me emotionally, either in a happy or sad way. Handa, despite being a arrogant perfectionist has a heart that he just doesn't want to show. Handa shows care and compassion for not only his art, but also for the other characters whom he befriends, especially Naru. Speaking of Naru, have I mentioned how adorable and hilarious this girl is? Just everything about her makes me happy! I wish she was my little sister!! We could have so much fun together!! Anyways, Handa and Naru are literally perfect for eachother! No, not in a romantic relationship way, but in a friendship way. Handa can teach Naru how to actually use her brain, since Naru is very clumsy and doesn't seem to know anything. But on the other hand, because of Handa's unfriendly personality, he doesn't have any friends... Upon reaching the island Handa finally realizes that all of his focus on art had brought him to miss the beauty of life/nature, and his super new friend, Naru will help Handa find his way. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is awesome, it's quite \"cutesy\" and I heard that the the producers kept the style very close to the manga. The art was simply a treat to watch, especially the sunset and the beautiful water shining before my eyes. Seriously the art, it just makes everything that much more funny and it mixes very well with how a scene is meant to be portrayed. I never really focused on the music, but I can tell you two things. First of all the Barakamon opening is my favorite opening of this season, which is saying something. And to add on to that, the voice cast matches each character's appearance. ESPECIALLY NARU!! Naru's voice is simply adorable, and I love her!!\\n\\n\r\nI'm just going to wrap up my first review by saying: watch it at least for Naru!! So Kawaii!",

            "content": "Without a doubt, Barakamon is one of the most relaxing anime out there in existence. If I had to describe Barakamon in short, it would be that it has been, a true panacea. \r\nBarakamon's story isn't anything groundbreaking or intricate, in fact, it is the authentic simplicity of the show, that truly permits one to adore this show to its utmost. With a soothing atmosphere and a refreshing cast of characters, Barakamon is one of those shows that rewards anyone from an arduous day of work. \r\nThe story revolves around Handa Seishuu, a young and enthusiastic calligrapher with pride and talent. Despite this, after havinghis worked criticised against him, he punches and old man, and thus, has been exiled to a rural country-side island to take some time off and reflect from his actions.\\n\\n\r\nTransformation, no, it is not transformation that Handa receives throughout his time here, but rather, it is the collective experience and memories forged on the island with the villagers that truly allow Handa to grow not only as a calligrapher, but as a human being. \\n\\n\r\nBarakamon is very subtle and implicit in portraying its underlying messages, and although the change of Handa is not colossal, it is the journey itself and the time spent on the island that tackles and exhibits the implied themes of resilience, hospitality and companionship. \\n\\n\r\nNaru is a noisy, boyish and talkative 7 year-old girl who accompanies Handa throughout the majority of the time and is another vital asset to the cast of the show. A lot of the show's comedy and humour derives off from Naru and her comical behavior and actions, making her an essential character in the series. What makes her so enticing and adorable is her infinite amounts of energy, as well as the content and cheerful atmosphere she emits. She finds almost anything, and everything hilarious and her relationship with Handa, somewhat subtly resembles a father and daughter relationship - bittersweet, beautiful and irreplaceable.  \\n\\n\r\nBarakamon also has a large cast of supporting characters as it encompasses the villagers from the island, and does a great job in fusing infants, children, teenagers, adults, and even the elderly in one whole setting - an embodiment of a bonded family. The villagers don't just feel like people from a village, but instead, people from a large family who bear a variety of personalities and care for each other. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the music, the outgoing opening song 'Rashisa' by Super Beaver immediately sets off with a lively atmosphere as the show begins, and puts the audience at ease and relaxation. The ending song 'Innocence' by NoisyCell is indeed amazing, a great way of ending each episode with a heartwarming feeling and soothing sensation it emits. Both pieces are undoubtedly superb choices of music and fits the show perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nNot just the music, but Handa's voice actor, Ono Daisuke, does a phenomenal job in depicting Handa's emotions and has a great versatile voice, being able to elicit sympathy in the more sentimental and emotional scenes, bring out humour though a sarcastic manner of speech, and is also capable of conveying a frustrated tone of voice when required. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the art, in all honesty, although it is nothing groundbreaking or extremely well-animated, it does not hinder the enjoyment or presentation of the show at all as it is after-all, a slice of life comedy show. The art itself, is intrinsically compelling to begin with and is consistent throughout, definitely suiting the rural setting of the show and develops a heartwarming feeling to the viewers. \\n\\n\r\nIf there's something I did not expect from Barakamon, it would be the laughs it has given to me constantly, and with great voice acting, this comedy is enhanced to a whole new level. In Barakamon, even the tiniest of the most trivial of things can make you laugh, and make Naru roll on the floor laughing in tears. It's the things that these characters do and their reactions that allow us to adore them and laugh alongside.\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon is an equilibrium between humour and emotion, none outclasses the other and they are both perfectly portrayed. One can argue that the world of calligraphy and its industry could have been explored more profoundly, but as a slice of life comedy and heartwarming series that focuses on its experiences, moments and its subtle themes more than a concrete and complex story, this show certainly has exceeded my expectations and comes out as a triumphant gem - and it's shows like these that I truly have no regrets in watching, and will definitely hope to see more in the future of anime.",

            "content": "Often, the slice-of-life genre is viewed as what is more or less the Seinfeld genre of anime - that they are \"shows about nothing.\" This is by no means a bad thing - shows like Non Non Biyori to a stellar job of proving that a show about the most inane daily activities can be greatly entertaining and sometimes even emotional. But that is also no excuse to produce SoL shows that have no true plot or character development. And that's where Barakamon comes in.\r\nBarakamon is, at its core, the story of a calligrapher named Seishuu Handa, and his interactions with the people around him.It's this character, and his development over the course of the story that I'm going to focus on in this review, because it's the heart and soul of the show. Seishuu is impulsive, childish, insecure, and generally immature, and this results in a number of problems arising in his life. The main one being his assault of an elderly calligraphy exhibit director who insults his work, which in turn gets him sent to the island on which 90% of the show takes place. From there, it turns into fairly standard SoL material, chronicling his interactions with the islanders over the course of each episode. But this is where Barakamon deviates from the average slice of life: in each episode, you can see a small part of Seishuu's immaturity slip away, and there is visible growth episode-to-episode for his character. In fact, his development is so critical that there are no other characters that change very drastically from the beginning of the show to the end - because they don't NEED to. Even the children on the island are, often, more mature and reasonable than the main character, which creates an interesting dynamic, especially in the case of Naru Kotoishi, Seishuu's young and tomboyish foil. The story maintains a wonderful sense of progression through Seishuu's character development, and his interactions with the other characters change noticeably over the course of the show, so that by the end there is a visibly more mature air to Seishuu and his character as a whole (although he retains more than a little impulsiveness).\\n\\n\r\nAside from the focus on the main character's development, there are other aspects of the show worth mentioning: Kinema Citrus does a remarkable job with the animation, and there are few moments in the show that aren't downright gorgeous to look at. The opening and ending themes are some of the best of the season, and the rest of the soundtrack rests comfortably in the background, providing mood music for each scene. The comedy is consistently good, and is interspersed comfortably throughout each episode to provide humor around every turn. One thing in particular I'd like to mention is Suzuko Hara's performance as Naru. Not only is it rare to see children voiced by children in anime, it's rarer still to find someone this good in their first performance. She lends a warmth and genuine kindness to the character that is hard to find anymore.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is really the last section here worth mentioning, and for me was high throughout the show. Each episode was strong all the way through, it delivered a good story and development while blending in the comfortable and familiar elements of the slice of life genre. If I had to come up with a metaphor to describe this show, I think I would say: Barakamon is like a cup of good hot tea - sometimes sweet, sometimes bitter, but always enjoyable, with a familiar and cheery feeling that warms the soul and leaves you wanting another glass (or episode, as it were).\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict: 10/10, one of the best shows of the Summer 2014 Season.",

            "content": "Growing up, spur of the moment family gatherings were some of my most cherished memories. The thick, summer air is palpable. Echoes of children giggling and playing in the distance reach the ear, soothing your mind and your shoulders slink down as all sense of stress and worry fade into nothingness. There\u2019s no distraction, no urgency, just an honest and accepting accompaniment by some of your favorite people in the world. Endearments are swapped by friends and family alike, and the atmosphere transforms more and more into one of constant comfortability. We all have those people in our lives whose presence brings up the entiregroup\u2019s spirits, resulting in jovial and lighthearted conversation. It\u2019s particular situations like this that we wish were able to be wrapped up nice and neat and placed on a shelf for eternity. \\n\\n\r\nThis is exactly the same feeling I get from watching Barakamon.\\n\\n\r\nReleased in one of anime\u2019s densest years (2014), Barakamon broke the edgy, action-laden status quo of modern anime with a wholesome, endearing tale of a world-renowned calligrapher sent to rural Japan to do some soul-searching. Produced by up-and-coming Studio Kinema Citrus (Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Black Bullet), Barakamon has a unique charm that can only be explained by a first hand experience. It works the senses and warms the heart more than any anime I can remember, leaving the viewer with a completeness unrivaled in the medium. For someone who has been consistently disappointed by Slice-of-Life anime, I was initially guarded in my openness to the series. However, in the following paragraphs, I hope to instill the same fondness of the series I have unto my readers, and finally divulge the reasons why Barakamon is one of my Top 10 favorite anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon at its core is a story of self-reflection and redemption. Seishuu Handa is an accomplished professional calligrapher, whose robotic method of artwork was both revered and criticized, depending on the individual. He always strives for perfection, but as a result is very self-deprecating and has a rather low sense of confidence. One instance of this criticism occurred on perhaps calligraphy\u2019s biggest stage, the Eika Prize Award reception. Upon receiving an insult from the Director himself over the lack of originality in his work, Seishuu reactively hurls his fist at him, resulting in public shame and discredibility. In an effort to cool down, Seishuu relocates the rural Goto where he meets the village scamp Naru, and learns the true meaning of happiness while discovering his instinctual nature as a calligrapher. \\n\\n\r\nThere aren\u2019t any shocking or overly-intellectual moments in Barakamon. Seishuu doesn\u2019t transform into an unrecognizable version of his former self by the end of the anime. Nor do the writers subvert their own formula by erratically dousing the viewers with fanservice. Barakamon tells us its story simply through atmosphere and character interaction. There aren\u2019t any convenient narrations or expositions of emotional text from characters to describe the feeling for a given scene. It allows us as viewers to take a step back and observe, rather than always trying to stay one step ahead of the story. Thematically speaking, everything is brought up very subtly. The anime also has little to actually do with calligraphy, but uses it as a vessel to help explain the magnitude of emotional growth Seishuu experiences through the series. Whether it\u2019s a fishing competition, hospital visit or just lounging around with some of your favorite people, Barakamon shows us joy in the simple things. Sometimes taking the time to relax and enjoy the company of others can really help put the world into perspective. \\n\\n\r\nMuch like the subtlety of the show\u2019s themes, the comedy sneaks up on you. It upholds some sense of purity in its presentation. There is no over-the-top gags here, no indecipherable cultural references and the slapstick comedy is realistic as opposed to exaggeratory (sans the ridiculously drawn Naru faces. My favorite moments were the mortified reactions by Seishuu when a various member of the cast would do something out of the ordinary. He was often left confused or awestruck with more commonplace actions from the locals. The result is that Barakamon helps bridge the gap between a city-minded viewer and a country-minded one by slapping the two cultural opposites together into one package. Subsequently, this adds relatability to its repertoire, something that a Slice-of-Life thrives on. The charming humor places the viewer right in the center of the story, as an observant fly on the wall. \\n\\n\r\nAs someone who grew up in a very urban area, I can relate on a certain level to the foreignness that Seishuu experiences when first arriving in Goto. He\u2019s an introvert, relying on his narrowed skill to speak for him rather than actually doing it himself. Everything is upended when he\u2019s ripped out of his shell and planted in a rural setting, where conversing socially is a regularity. His interaction with the cast throughout the rest of the series is a beaming indicator of his true personality. Seishuu is actually quite immature, making his conversations with Naru and her younger friends natural. Naru helps him to emerge from his closed-off nature by placing him in some rather precarious scenarios along the way, much to Seishuu\u2019s immediate objections. Each heartwarming scene that passes only strengthens the sense of relatability in our protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nNaru is quite possibly the glue that holds Barakamon together. Her mannerisms, disposition and interactions with Seishuu and the rest of the cast radiate with innocence and likability. The best part? She\u2019s voiced by an actual child. Kinema Citrus really did their homework when it came to assembling the seiyuu\u2019s for Barakamon. Not only does the high-pitched, airy voice add to the realism, it also sounds more soothing to the ear instead of a forced inflection put on by an adult. Naru and the rest of the cast of kids act their age in this anime, instead of presenting the facade of a 13 year old mature enough to rule the world as in most anime out there today. They easily cry when upset, and they find joy and contentment in some of the most trivial activities. Their personalities were extraordinarily refreshing to see, adding some legitimacy along the way. One aspect of the cast one may find less than stellar is the character development. There really aren\u2019t any defining examples of it anywhere outside of Seishuu. Despite this negative, I can\u2019t say that it actually deterred from the anime in any way. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the animators won\u2019t win any awards for outstanding achievement in art, I can say that the style fit Barakamon very well. Flourishes of bright hues calm the viewers into an almost lucid, dreamlike state. Colors are slightly washed out, leaving the characters and their interactions to become the focal point of the anime. Some of the more comedic scenes involving a various roulette of character faces were downright hilarious, and I give full marks for creativity in that department. The character models are attractive, and the children are cute, with their oversized heads and lanky appendages. \\n\\n\r\nFrom a sound perspective, I have little to no complaints. The OP, \u201cRashisa\u201d is lively and works to tell a story of its own, showing the pesky Naru infiltrating Seishuu\u2019s house and causing her usually adorable mischief. If you ever get a chance to download the full version of this song, it includes the infamous scene of the Goto villagers calling Seishuu after he makes his way back to the city. Let\u2019s just say, it made a few tears well up in my eyes\u2026 The ED is equally as fitting, and offers a fluid wrap up of each of Barakamon\u2019s 12 episodes. When present, the background themes are jolly and catchy, sprucing up the accompanied scene. This is one of the few anime I actually downloaded the OST for, though whether for nostalgia or quality reasons I\u2019m really not sure. Lastly, is the outstanding performance of Barakamon\u2019s cast of voice actors. Suzuko Hara is unequivocally charming as Naru, and her performance should serve as a beacon for other producers to follow when casting child roles in anime. The same could be said for Rina Endou (Hina), as she\u2019s enjoyed continued fitting roles, like the lovable Tsumugi from Amaama to Inazuma.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, as subjective as it may be, is the one factor that keeps anime fans coming back for more. This is the primary reason why I weight it heavier than any other category when scoring a review. Barakamon was chocked full of endearing moments, and had one of the most lighthearted, engrossing atmospheres I\u2019ve ever experienced in an anime. It just hit home for me on so many levels. Couple this with the well-crafted cast and corresponding soundtrack, and this anime becomes an instant classic. I think many viewers or critics come into Barakamon with preconceived notions of what it should be, and may come away unfulfilled. This anime doesn\u2019t do much, but what it does do is done so subtly, yet brilliantly that it\u2019s hard to put into words. I recommend this series to fans of anime like Usagi Drop, the aforementioned Amaama to Inazuma, or those who want an engrossing, feel-good show without high stakes or overthought plotlines. Thank you to all who took the time to read this review, and be sure to check out some of my other work!       \\n\\n\r\nStory-8\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nCharacters-8\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nOverall-9.0",

            "content": "\u201cThe other thing is surrounding yourself with people that care for you. These are simple things, but they're powerful, and they've completely transformed who I am and how I perceive myself.\u201d - Mariel Hemingway\r\n\u2018Barakamon\u2019 is a rare kind of story. Something that is just so simple, yet so powerful. There are no big expositions of drama and no complicated plotlines, none of that is needed in the slightest. The story is simple, easy to grasp, and beautiful to watch as it plays out. In its purest form, it\u2019s simply the story of an arrogant (but still kind-hearted) young man that simply can\u2019t seem to letgo of his pride, and how he matures from the time he spends with the townsfolk of his new home. \\n\\n\r\nI would be amiss to not mention one thing though: the show is not sappy in the least despite what was just said. Rather, it is hilarious. Every episode is full to the brim with unforced comedy that hits almost every time. It\u2019s amazing how a show so hilarious can also be so heartwarming and display so much character growth without feeling unbalanced at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the driving force behind this show. They steer the comedy and development in the right direction and are all memorable and likable. From wise elderly villagers, all the way to little kids with a seemingly unlimited supply of energy and an unquenchable thirst for adventure. The two most prominent and important characters of this wacky bunch are Handa and Naru.\\n\\n\r\nHanda is the \u201carrogant (but still kind-hearted) young man\u201d talked about earlier. He is a surprisingly layered character in many respects once you come to know him a little bit. You get to see the effects of his slow change over time through his thoughts and expressions \u2013 and eventually through his actions. He\u2019s an all-around great character that is lots of fun to follow, because, despite the fact that he is sometimes a jerk, you can\u2019t help but care about the guy. \\n\\n\r\nAnd there is also Naru. I absolutely love this little ball of fun. She\u2019s cute, she\u2019s clumsy and kind, and out of all the villagers she is the one that impacts Handa the most. Naru takes an indirect role akin to a little sibling with our gruff \u2018jelly bean\u2019 (hard on the outside, soft on the inside) of a main character, and this is where the most consistent change within Handa comes from. Sure, a few events happen that give a big push to his development \u2013 but Naru is definitely the one who changes him most. And aside from her very subtle plot significance, she\u2019s a fantastic character who brings a lot of fun, warmth and smiles.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for everyone was great. Ono Daisuke did a great job portraying Handa, and Hara Suzuko, the little girl who voices Naru, did a fantastic job for only being nine years old. She had to make it sound natural, but also give it a slight comedic edge at times, which is harder than you might think. \\n\\n\r\nAs for music, they used it in a very efficient and subtle manner. The backing tracks are mostly light scores \u2013 fitting the mood and tone of the series. They only occasionally go bombastic, and only at times in which that style of music works for the current scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is solid too. It\u2019s high quality, bright, full of life and gorgeous. The best example of this is the show\u2019s ED, with glistening watercolors of assorted creams and light browns.\\n\\n\r\nYou may have realized I didn\u2019t say anything negative about this anime \u2013 not a thing. And that\u2019s really because there\u2019s nothing that I can find that\u2019s wrong with it. It\u2019s extremely simple all-in-all, and all its simple facets are amazingly put together. I have no gripes or even any nitpicks. What we got with this anime is amazing \u2013 and I wouldn\u2019t change any of it. \\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t believe me? Watch it for yourself and decide. Not everyone will like this as much as I did. A few may not like it at all, and that\u2019s fine. But this is one series that everyone should give a chance to.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime is one of the best I've seen in recent history. The story, though simple, is heartwarming in the truest form. The episodes are mostly day-to-day adventures, but each one is clever, uplifting, and very often hilarious.\r\nThe regular animation is nice in and of itself, but I gave it a 9 for two reasons. Firstly, as calligraphy is a central part of the plot, it obviously has to show up on screen from time to time. The creators did an excellent job of designing  beautiful calligraphy that is just is amazing animated as in real life. Secondly, the ED is just plain andsimply gorgeous. It's done in a watercolor style that you can just watch in awe.\\n\\n\r\nThat reminds me. The OP has a song that gives me chills just from how heartwarming it is. As for the voice acting, Daisuke Ono is awesome, as usual. His character is funny, cute, and really enjoyable. Though who I give the most praise to is Suzuko Hara, the real little girl who voices Naru. She does an amazing job acting, but with all the real emotions of being a kid.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are fun and really developed. And while most shows don't fully capture everything that is childhood, this hits it spot-on. Every character , kid or otherwise, has their own little quirks and personalities. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, this anime was overall really fun to watch. I loved every episode and was sad when I finally finished it.",

            "content": "\"More than what meets the eye\"\r\nAfter reading the synopsis, I was quite hesitant to start Barakamon. I thought for sure i wouldn't find something like a calligraphy focused anime interesting. Boy i was wrong, i definitely could not have been more wrong.\r\n|Objective Review|\r\n|Story/Plot|\r\nCalligraphy, something that seems a bit boring at first. However, Barakamon makes you realize the meaning and depth behind it. It shows off the passion and emotions behind such works. The anime progresses at a great pace, maintaining the interest of the viewers. \r\nThe focus is evenly distributed to all aspects of the anime. We get a deep look at calligraphy, the characters,the village. Barakamon really keeps things fresh and varied until the very end. \\n\r\nThe story as a whole is very solid. The main story line nothing outstanding (finding the lost inspiration), but since it's so well worked out, it gives a solid foundation for the anime. It has a beginning, a great development, and a spectacular finish. A beautifully arched story-line that doesn't lose focus of what it wants.\\n\r\nStory Score - 9\\n\\n\r\n|Slice of life|\\n\r\nWhat can i say, even I who has the emotions of a small rock at the bottom of the ocean got inspired by this heart warming story of a lost man trying to find his path and personal touch in his life and career. A great message supported by pillar morals like friends, family and listening to your heart. What keeps it outstanding from other animes, is how it connects all these messages to calligraphy. The two really work well together.\\n\\n\r\n|Comedy|\\n\r\nI was honestly not expecting too much comedy, but it was a very pleasant surprise. All the jokes and fun times were natural, nothing forced. It all came so naturally, nothing of the usual cliches. Barakamon utilized the forms of comedy to perfection, varying situational, environmental and verbal jokes. It really complemented the laid-back and relaxed ambiance of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n|Characters|\\n\r\nWonderful character choices. It's all natural. None of them are forced characters, they are rather someone who you can encounter easily in real life. There are no extreme characters, yet they are still so unique and different. As far as character development goes, we shouldn't look at the individual characters, but rather how they evolve as a big family. Obviously, the main characters get their fair share of character development, but it's really the community that grabs the attention of the viewer.\\n\r\nCharacter Score - 9\\n\\n\r\n|Art|\\n\r\nBeing a somewhat art related anime, the visuals do deliver as expected. I was pleasantly surprised by how consistent it was.\\n\r\nArt Score - 8\\n\\n\r\n|Sound|\\n\r\nThe voice acting was super fun and cute. They really out-did themselves this time. The soundtracks go well with the scenes and the opening was especially nice for me.\\n\r\nSound Score - 7\\n\\n\r\n|The whole package|\\n\r\nAs i have already mentioned, this anime is much more than what meets the eye. If you want to run away from the stressful city life like Seishuu Handa did, and just relax, get inspiration, warm up you heart or perhaps just to get a good laugh, then this anime is surely for you.\\n\r\nOverall score - 9\\n\\n\r\n|Subjective Review| (SPOILER alert)\\n\r\nBoy oh boy. First of all, i loved all of their characters so much.  Fun, laid back and cute. Just the right people for me. But what really got me is when Handa went back to Tokyo and had a talk with his mom about going back to the village. The fact that he found someplace that he can call home, was just sooo emotional for me. that was For me, who never really got to know a place which i could call home, this really made become a crybaby for at least 20 mins. When he opened the box sent to him, well that totally killed me. I don't thihnk i have ever cried this hard and felt this happy for a fictional character. Due to this, the anime gets a unquestionable 11.\\n\r\nSubjective Score - 11/10",

            "content": "Barakamon\u2026  Ah, the feeling of watching something so laid-back is really refreshing. First thing that came into my mind when I heard Barakamon was, to tell you the truth, Digimon. I\u2019m sorry, I really am! Good thing I was wrong. Phew. * wipes sweat *\r\nAt first I was like, \u201cPshhhh\u2026  Another gorgeous looking guy. I bet this show will target adolescent girls.\u201d But, MIGHTY ZEUS SMITE ME FOR BEING AN INSOLENT FOOL! I am wrong in million ways.\r\nI\u2019ll keep my review short and simple.\r\nStory: 8\r\nHanda Seishu is a 23-year-old calligrapher (most good-looking you\u2019ll ever see). He\u2019s forced to live on a small islandfor hitting a well-known calligrapher. Handa is a shut-in by nature, but he has to live on an island entirely foreign to him. With his new \u201csilly neighbors\u201d who practically trespass his house, invades his privacy, and plays in front of his house, how will Handa handle his situation with these people? You\u2019d know after watching this hilarious comedy. \\n\r\nLaid-back as a sloth, Barakamon\u2019s plot I mean. It\u2019s not a bad thing, at all. In fact, it\u2019s one of Barakamon\u2019s redeeming factors. It can make you smile\u2026 a lot! And the best part, you don\u2019t have to think about any complicated plots. I highly recommend Barakamon if you aren\u2019t looking for any plot-heavy series, but just a plain laid-back and relaxing show that\u2019ll bring you lots of smirks, if not smiles.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nPerfect sceneries and perfectly drawn characters = 9. Not much to say in the art department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\n* sigh * I wish my little sister was this cute? Oh, I\u2019m talking about Naru, an adorable 7-year-old kid who always hangs out and plays with Handa. You can say she\u2019s the most adorable character in the show. Second is Hina, a crybaby who\u2019s always with Naru (also an adorable little human). In short, every single character in the show compliments each other. They fill out each other\u2019s \u201cmissing link\u201d. For an example: Handa\u2019s a pessimist by nature, but almost everyone in the island is a positive thinker, especially Naru. You get it now, ne?\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8\\n\r\n2 songs for a 12 episode show. Opening theme is done by Super Beaver, which I find great. And the Ending theme\u2019s done by NoisyCell titled \u201cInnocence\u201d which is not entirely bad, too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI ENJOYED IT. I ENJOYED IT. I ENJOYED IT. It has been a while since a no-deep-plot show had made me this happy. There\u2019s more to Anime than deep plots, bouncing boobs, sword-fighting, etc. And what\u2019s that? Simplicity\u2014simple things that make us laugh. Sometimes I forgot how something not-so-special show like this could bring a smile to my grumpy-Asian face.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\n9\u2019s a perfect score for me to give to Barakamon. Like I\u2019ve been saying, there\u2019s nothing special with the series. It\u2019s a simple show that can\u2014will make you laugh. It\u2019ll also teach you a thing or two about being mature, I think. \\n\r\nOverall, Barakamon\u2019s been a great show for me. \\n",

The characters are coherent, natural and really lovable. The overall art is great and some scenes are truly astonishing. In term of personal enjoyment, it has been a while since I smiled so much during an anime: the humor of the situations is light and there're a lot of heartwarming scenes. Too short might've been the only flaw but the ending was at a perfect place to stop. It was damn near perfect, imglad I've seen this.",

            "content": "The hype left me hanging... I still want more of Barakamon!\r\nFor a simple series such as this, using nature as an element to pique the watcher's interest is of pure genius indeed. Barakamon, in my opinion, had hidden intentions of giving Japan's tourism faction, most likely the premise of Gotou Islands in Nagasaki, a simple push. But the fact is, my speculation may prove wrong at some end.\r\nBarakamon started with a bang. The first episode, with no further meaningless addition introduces the beautifully depicted countryside. For a young adult who grew up his entire life sheltered in the city, living far from civilization may spellthe end of his calligraphy career. Well, why not? Let's be honest, hierarchy is such a scary thing.\\n\\n\r\nHaving been secluded in a peaceful yet whacky countryside, the protagonist meets the village rascal. For all I know, I end up laughing every time the protagonist ended up being pulled around by the young child. With the addition of the whole antic group, I can assure that every anime watcher can feel and tell that Barakamon is a fresh breath of air among the pile of low-level and generic titles this season.\\n\\n\r\nBut honestly, why does everybody like Barakamon?\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, it is comedy-based. With bratty kids front-lining the show, we who already saw it had it coming that it'll be one where a normal brat lives of the life in the countryside. Freer than the city kids, ignorant of video games, sweat and running, always enjoying the good nature. Even the simplest countryside trivia is affiliated to a light joke that doubles the fun into it. The life at the countryside is like a 360 degree rotated roulette and Barakamon marvelously added spice by using a rowdy youngster group to stir up the events that happened in the show. \\n\\n\r\nSecond, characters. Barakamon credited a colorful cast. With good characters, even the simplest story can be vividly enjoying to the majority and Barakamon justified the fact. With each and every other characters giving contrasts, complementing one another. With a city-grown young man, whose characters are cynical and impulsive. The fun was always new to him since he has been ignorant of the normal fun in his own way. The main fact I thoroughly enjoyed Barakamon is because I enjoyed the company of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThird, the lessons. Like in most anime titles, Barakamon spreads out a lessons to the watchers. \\n\\n\r\n\"Be prudent and at the same live life to the fullest\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is the lesson I got from the series. While it's obvious from the very start, it still never fails to make an impact when I thought of it deeply. Impulses, spur of moments, regrets, despair. One can never avoid such trifles because one meaning of life is to tackle hardships and at the same time, paying respects to each and every other people. Acknowledging mistakes and working up your way even after a hard fall, Barakamon gives the idea that the whole world being unfair is just an exaggeration. Living life to the fullest is still the right way to burn out life.\\n\\n\r\nArt-wise, I believe it still fits the 2014 category. While it strikes me as average in the character department, the scenery department is amazing. I fully enjoyed every part of nature as if I also saw it real-time. \\n\\n\r\nFor the sound department, I am not in any way projecting a rude gesture. but Japs singers had it really tough singing english lyrics so sorry, I found it weird. Same as the OP, it's different from the usual but at the same time, I haven't been much interested on it. Aside the from the opening and ending themes, the bgms are quite good to the ears and were the perfect fit for every frames.\\n\\n\r\nConcluding, Barakamon defines one side of a normalcy far from the city. While it may prove not alluring to some, I, who had a fair share of visiting the countryside comprehends the beauty the show has to offer. Funny, interesting and meaningful are just three simple words I can offer to those who still haven't seen it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Barakamon allows you the chance to peer into a story of struggle and self growth, without being bogged down by melodrama.  Each episode is well timed and made good use of comedy, providing a very relaxed ride while you watched the characters continue on their journey.  I very much enjoyed this fact.  Unfortunately this made for a very predictable story as well.  By episode 6, I had no doubts about how this anime would end.  I know some people do not mind this, but I enjoy just a little mystery when it comes to the conclusion of a story.\r\nThe artstyle used in Barakamon, while good, is nothing special.  This is not a totally bad thing though.  The style is a safe one, allowing the viewer to focus more on the characters and the story over anything else.  The emotional effects are done well and each character is unique in both visuals and personality.  So over all, the safe approach turned out to be the best approach.  But it is nothing that will leave a lasting impression on me.\\n\\n\r\nIn this medium the power of the voice is very important.  Each character in Barakamon is voiced by a very talented actor, bring them to life on the screen.  A lot of times when I am watching a subbed anime, I have a hard time trying to figure out which character is talking if they aren't currently being shown on screen.  But I had no problem knowing who was talking and when while watching this.  Which was a very nice change for me.  The sound effects are done well, adding to the over all comedy of the show.  The only aspect keeping this section form getting a perfect 10 from me is the music.  It was very lacking in this area.  Other than the opening and ending themes, the music used throughout the show left very little impact on me.  Which is quite the shame seeing how it has the power to add even more to a scene.\\n\\n\r\nWith a genera like Slice of Life, characters are the most important aspect.  When it comes to Barakamon, they are perfectly done.  There is a clear line showing how they were before, and after the main character is introduced.  The experiences they share allows them to grow bonds that the viewer can clearly see.  Not much else to say about it really.  Perfectly done.\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon was an emotional ride without being crazy emotional, and I enjoyed ever second of it.  In it's 12 episodes it manages to do what most anime can't do in 20.  Is it something that is ground breaking and never seen before?  No, but that shouldn't keep you from watching it.  Sometimes the tried and tested aspects of anime work the best, and is definitely works for Barakamon.",

            "content": "The summer 2014 anime \"Barakamon\" has stood out to me as one of the \"best slice of life\" for this season. Why you may ask? Well, watch it if haven't already and those who have watched it will hopefully understand/agree to what I have to say. Let's begin! :3\r\nBarakamon is about a guy named Handa Seishuu, who is a calligrapher that is sent to the calm location  \"Goto Island\". This was due to his actions of punching an elderly curator that criticized his artwork during a Calligraphy Exhibition. From here on, Handa meets many wonderful villagers and befriends a little girl named Naru andothers too.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really is extraordinary not only for it's unique comedy, but for having relatable situations  and problems that we can really understand. It's as if we are Handa ourselves; because most of things he goes through, we also have experienced ourselves. For example, there are times when he can get depressed over something little and as the viewer, we can't help but actually realize we do the same thing. And that's what makes Barakamon good, since it does it's slice-of-life really well.\\n\\n\r\nI have to give props to this anime when it comes to its animation and music. Both tie in together perfectly and create an atmosphere that makes you filled with delight. So, I give an awesome shout-out to the studio that did Barakamon and the music too.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I bet you are getting bored right now, but stay and wait for a little longer. I will try to speed this up okay! : )\\n\\n\r\nIf there's another thing Barakamon is good at it, it's the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon has a wonderful cast of characters. We have the main protagonist, Handa Seishuu who is calligrapher. He struggles to find his own artistic style,  but also goes through the problem of maturing his own well-being. In order to do so, he needs inspiration to succeed. And here, we have the adorable child Naru that helps Handa to find this inspiration who is full of optimism and can always bring a smile on your face. As soon as Naru is in the screen, she just makes you happy. Of course, the rest of characters also are amazing and bring a comedic feel in the anime just as well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Barakamon is superb for it's comedy/slice-of-life elements and is a very heartwarming series to view. I highly recommend this wonderful anime series to anyone and give hope they give it a try if they have the time. It is something you won't regret watching because it will fill you with happiness and will hopefully give you a smile on your face. This is why I give this series a 9/10 and I hope you enjoyed this review! Chow! :D\\n\\n",

            "content": "Barakamon, a really nice, light hearted, warm slice of life anime. In this world of digital media, internet and smartphones, Barakamon takes you to a calm and soothing country lifestyle filled with outdoor activities, interesting characters, nice comedy and gives the message that coming out on top isn't always necessary. Sometimes, you have to enjoy what you have and things will sort themselves out.\r\nTaking it slowly and calmly and delivering it's message well is what this anime is about.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nOur main protagonist, Handa is a NEET (not gaming but into calligraphy) living in tokyo and a professional calligrapher with no friends and group activites. Hegets sent to a backward island which lacks the average hustle bustle of Tokyo. There he meets up with people who show him around, have fun and help him in the new lifestyle. At first, he aims to become a good calligrapher and find his unique style but as time passes on, he calms down and gets attached to the new lifestyle with his new friends. He doesn't forget his original goal, it's just that he calms down and finds the answer in his own pace.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nWell, the artwork in this anime is just as I'd expected it to be. Nothing too fancy and nothing as bad as to make me turn it down. It's what you'd expect from a slice of life comedy anime. It's not awesome, it's just good and makes each episode pleasing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nWon't go into the depth of the openings or endings. The videos were nice but the songs didn't catch me that much. Maybe I'll give them another try sometime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\r\nOur protagonist, Handa Seishuu, is your average NEET living in tokyo with minimum friends and is all work no play. He is very proud of his talent and looks down on people. Upon his arrival at the island, his personality changes when he meets the people and he matures and immatures in certain aspects.\\n\r\nThen their are the kids of the island who become his friends. Each of them are just what you'd expect from a carefree kid; having fun and making trouble.\\n\r\nSome teens are also a part of the cast and they are no less than the kids. Each of them has their separate personality and setting. While someone has a manga obsession, the other is stuck taking care of Handa.\\n\r\nAll in all, the characters are pretty interesting and make the series fun to watch. You'll be looking forward to some of them and may find a couple favorites in them too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series. Since I'm done with the action anime for a while so this anime was definitely an amazing choice. The comedy was indeed funny, really funny sometimes to make you burst out laughing. Some deep stuff in the anime is well worth noting. It's a good anime for you to watch if you're looking for some light hearted comedy with a good lesson.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, loved it. Characters were interesting and funny. The protagonist was nice and art was pleasing. A really nice anime to watch and a good lesson to learn.\\n\\n\r\nAnd one of my favorite phrases from this anime:\\n\r\n\"Being able to work hard is the best talent of all.\"\\n\r\n    - Kido Hiroshi",

            "content": "Never has there been as many instances where an anime was successful in showing nostalgic sentimentality with regards to making us feel homely inside. This once in a blue moon example of nostalgia, shows some of the strangest goofy humor that wouldn't usually be in a show like Barakamon. Like all surprising gems, what Barakamon does is not merely retread the slice of life with a different style to make it seem different; but instead, breathes all new life with that different style and makes it its own unique identity.\r\nFrom the moment Barakamon starts, everything is peaceful and serene from how the setting feels intricatelysubtle in its atmosphere. The art plays a significant role in making this possible. There isn't any brush-stroke style artwork present in it like many shows of this nature, such as Usagi Drop, but it has its influences of say, Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro. Not only do the characters and their vivid facial expressions have some impact from that, but the environments are also neatly crafted in that old-school Studio Ghibli aesthetic.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to what I mentioned previously, many people like to point out the various similarities between Barakamon and Usagi Drop. One main similarity is how the characters are portrayed and express emotion. You have the main male protagonist who is likable, but at the same time can be a bit of a pain for people around him. Then you have the cute girl that everyone adores because of how sweet and realistic she comes across in her actions and humorous dialogue. But there is a clear distinction to be made from both of these shows. While Usagi Drop had its comedic moments, it wasn't a full-on comedy show and more of a slice-of-life, whereas, with Barakamon, it is the exact opposite.\\n\\n\r\nNot to say it is all comedy, but the majority of the time we spend with these characters involve hilarious situations involving the protagonist, Seishuu, and the main little girl, Naru. Even with what I said earlier, just like in Usagi Drop, the chemistry between the two main characters is nothing short of brilliance, but on a different spectrum than in Usagi Drop. Because Barakamon heavily relies on comedy more, the show's lighthearted story adds a fresh element for us to gander upon. These two play off as complete opposites, personality wise, and throughout the narrative, they start to grow into each other own rational mindset and become friends in the process.\\n\\n\r\nIts pacing helps in building up Seishuu and Naru's friendship as a slow process to garner a credible, realistic story given in context to its overall tone. With its lack of story, all that it has going for it is the characters' growth and how Seishuu is more accepting to the snotty kids that give him a difficult time on the island. While I feel as though the adult characters seem weaker on this aspect than the children, they are still more serviceable to the show than actually making an enormous impression. Nevertheless, all of the characters at least have one comedic moment that proves to be an instant joy that will seer into your memory after watching it.\\n\\n\r\nAny story fulfilling a slice of life show like Barakamon can be second nature depending on the context. It does at least try to convey a narrative that involves Seishuu trying to succeed as a local calligrapher in this new local town he is in. However, it does not emphasize it as great importance since it pales in comparison to the comedy in terms of sheer value and consideration. What does make it less of an issue is that the humor is actually great to get through, so there is always something to look forward to amidst most of the drab story that they shoehorned in.\\n\\n\r\nOne aspect of the story that does not venture slightly off of a cliff is the character development in the cast. Every character has a distinct characteristic, while maybe cliched in a few areas, that ultimately makes them unforgettable. Their comedic interactions certainly help in sealing this asset, thanks to the brilliant comedic timing the writers put their effort into. Honestly, the best parts involve the children and the way the writers portray them as genuine kids and not the typical sensational ones we often see in Romantic Comedy/Ecchi animes that we're used to. Now that doesn't signify as a bad thing for those particular genres as they are unique in their own right and context, but it is a nice change of pace to see an anime that does try to take it on a pragmatic level.\\n\\n\r\nDelightful and sentimental are two definitive words that can describe Barakamon as a whole. Think of it as a journey through your inner childhood and how you viewed the world as this happy place to live in. As you grow older, you don't think that way anymore. This is where Barakamon hits home on setting a subtle message. When we look through Seishuu's viewpoint, we can empathize his pain of going through rowdy kids like Naru as an annoyance at the first encounter. Then, at the same time, we spend some time on Naru's rationale and can also relate to how we've all been as little kids. It doesn't nearly take a side on how we should treat each other, but merely just a general examination.\\n\\n\r\nFor the naysayers who complain that slice-of-life in-of-itself is a boring genre where nothing happens, I can assure them that there is a lot to experience in Barakamon that can convert even the harshest critic. Not only are there things that happen, but they can be entertaining even without the context of slice-of-life in its name. While I wouldn't classify this as the best one in the genre, I still hold that with Usagi Drop, as it does have some problems related to a dry plot, that shouldn't be a huge issue in an otherwise subtle slice-of-life show. If Naru-chan never makes you smile with sheer goofiness and hilarity, I don't know what will.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "Barakamon doesn't contain magic, elaborate plot twists, or intense, action-filled scenes. In fact, it is very ordinary in its depiction of life in general. However, this is exactly what makes this anime so likeable and relatable. It could very well happen in real life.\r\nStory: 7\r\nConflict: a calligrapher tried to punch his problems away and ends up on an island to reflect. Is his calligraphy really unoriginal? How can he make it original? And how can he apologize to the man he punched? The whole idea of calligraphy being the main subject of an anime is appealing in its uniqueness and makes the plot somewhat mysteriousat first in that you're not sure what to expect. In the end, it is pretty straightforward and nothing unexpected much happens at all, though there are a lot of heart-warming, funny situations thanks to the relationships between the characters, (but more on the characters later).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nOnce again, ordinary. Not a bad thing, though! There are no people with purple or green hair or even anyone with blue eyes (one or two blondes, though), but that just adds to the relatability of the story. And it's not like the art is simplistic either, though I'm not any kind of expert on these matters.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8\\n\r\nI could listen to the theme song over and over again. It is unique as well and puts you in a good mood for the rest of each episode. The background music fits well with each scene it is used in, enhancing the mood accordingly. Not like I'm an expert when it comes to sound, either though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\r\nLike I mentioned earlier, the characters are what really make the story here shine because of the relationships between them and because of how they all help the main character, Handa Seishu develop as a calligrapher and a person. Each character has their own special quirks that make them likeable and real (and make the comedy possible). In short, they become Handa's family, and create a place for him to belong: his home. They remind him that there is more to life than first place and help him grow up a little, despite most of them being much younger or older than him.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\r\nDespite the plot being a little slow, each episode had it's own charm. I guess you could say it moved along much like life does--with each new episode you don't know what might happen, much like with each new day you don't know what life might through at you. The message of Barakamon is very warm, the characters and their quirks will leave you with a smile, and the ending is satisfying. Barakamon was clean and simple, a nice break from the flashiness of most anime these days (although I have nothing against flashiness).",

            "content": "Barakamon is a Slice-of-Life and comedy anime from Kinema Citrus (Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Black Bullet) and aired in 2014. It is the adaptation of the manga of the same name and was directed by Masaki Tachibana (Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, .hack//Quantum).\r\nFrom the get-go, Barakamon is different from your average anime. The premise is unique, but simple. The main character is not a high-schooler, but an adult with profession. Calligraphy is a subject that is never touched upon in any other stories, let alone be one of the main themes.\r\nActually, this anime is unusual in almost every regard. Rather than trying to be explicit, it tries tobe subtle and calming. Instead of advancing its story with drama, it does so almost purely with character interactions. And, most of all, it does not take itself (too) seriously.\\n\\n\r\nJust like the calligraphy shown, Barakamon possesses an overwhelming subtlety that is very rare in this medium. The characters don't just change suddenly and in a huge way, but have a gradual progression that feels just too real. And that is another huge thing, every character feels like someone you could meet in real life and genuinely talk to, without feeling too generic.\\n\\n\r\nSeishuu or Sensei (that is how the islanders call him) is incredibly easy to relate to. He has all of the insecurities that plague every city dweller and some others that anyone who likes to write or paint can understand. The way he describes the \"tingling\" that is inspiration is beautiful and something that I, personally, understood instantly.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also the matter of the way the anime is crafted. Each one of its 12 episodes includes either one or two, mostly, self-contained stories. But each one of them has its own significance to the characters, despite not having that huge influence on them, just like in real life. Actually, a couple of weeks back I was talking about this, that the exciting things on life are actually the small stuff that adds up with time and creates wonderful memories, that is also what Barakamon defends, at least to me.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the anime, I was kind of broken inside: I wanted to continue seeing these characters grow, bit by bit. But it also made me realize (again) how magical life is. How every single thing you has an effect to someone and can end up changing them. I felt something unique, something that was, at the same time, depressing, hopeful, happy, sad and wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual style is also very subtle, but barebones. There is not a whole lot of detail most of the times and the body proportions of the kids is exaggerated but, damn, I thought it was wonderful and captured everything that is great about this story. The calligraphy that is shown in the anime is beautiful, specially if you try to analyze it, as it can mean a lot more than what it seems to be at first glance.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting deserves note, as well. Normally, kids in animation are dubbed by woman speaking in a higher pitch, but in Barakamon the kids are dubbed by actual kids and, boy, they just nail it. They completely understand these characters and give them life. And the voice actors of the older characters are also pretty amazing.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed every single moment of this anime in a way that is extremely rare. It is everything that I think a story should be: entertaining, but deep, fun, but also slightly intellectual, believable, but with a touch of magic and charm. I watched it in just one sitting (with one small pause to eat), but I regret doing that, as I should have taken my time with it and savored each episode with calm and attention.\\n\\n\r\nPart of the reason I loved every second of it is how easily I related with the protagonist. We are both trying to find our own styles in our respective mediums. This fact, for sure, influenced my enjoyment of the show and I don't know if I would have felt this way if I hadn't been in a similar situation to that of Seishuu.\\n\\n\r\nFrom this day forward, not only this is now my favorite anime of all time, it will also be the anime I will recommend to anyone that doubts the validity of this medium. It is just that wonderful. And I think that anyone who is okay with an anime in which \"nothing\" happens should watch it, as it is exactly what a great Slice-of-Life should be. I would also recommend it to anyone who is a bit depressed with life, as it can be completely revitalizing with its various teachings and philosophy.",

            "content": "Individuality.  The idea that we as people are different than another other person in existence.  We all have our own style when it comes to doing things, the way we walk, the way we talk, and even the way we speak.  In fact, this review you're reading is an example of individuality, written in a style only this specific author can do.  So now we face the classic story of finding one's self in Barakamon.\r\nStory (8.00/10): Barakamon is a very simple story.  Our main protagonist Seishuruu Handa (I'll be calling him sensei for this review) is a calligrapher, an artistthat does calligraphy for a living as his art style to show the world his passion.  On one specific calligraphy exhibition, Handa (in simple terms) gets upset and smacked the calligraphy director over the head with his own cane.  (It's as funny as it sounds.)  As a result of his outburst, Handa is sent to a remote island off of Japan so that he may reflect on his own behaviors and improve on his calligraphy which was deemed \"plain\".\\n\\n\r\nFrom the setting, it's clear that the story is based on the classic island setting where an outsider that has no idea about rural life, and is suddenly thrown into a entire smorgasbord of antics and situations that he might not have encountered himself beforehand.  Barakamon follows this time-tested method, but certainly adds a nice twist to it.  From episode to episode, the structure of the anime is relatively the same, with Sensei being dragged along to participate (unwillingly I might add) in various games and events that he learns about after being a resident of the island, with the end result being a few minutes of brief character thinking that makes the character development for Sensei.  What this series benefits from this is the fact that it is a very easy to follow story, and a relaxing one as well.  There are no points in the series that are actually any real downer moments and as an audience, we get to learn about the island and its customs right alongside with Sensei himself, making the show a very good watching experience.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, Barakamon hosts its own unique brand of comedy.  While island humor itself isn't new due to many fish out of water stories about new people coping on a to them, foreign island have been many times before, Barakamon does provide a nice group of comedic moments that make it unique only because of Sensei's...unique personality.  There are some memorable moments, but sadly, many aren't really that memorable.  They're funny, don't get me wrong, but I personally don't find them as anime moments that I would remember when doing something and start laughing.  (Nothing beats Yurippe's launching desks from Angel Beats.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Barakamon had very high marks all around.  The comedy while not as memorable as other shows, did have its own unique and individual flair to it that made it appealing, separating it from the herd of other slice of life's.  The pacing was decent enough so that you could get both a blend of story progression and plot (even though the whole series is basically about a 20-something year old playing around with little kids on an island) and overall, the show did have a nice and very heartwarming feeling to it.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Decent pacing\\n\r\n+  Good mix between comedy and story progression\\n\r\n+  Unique comedy\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.41/10):  Like most slice of life's, Barakamon is a very heavily character-based show.  The cast of Barakamon is not only interesting, but they're also very memorable personalities as well.\\n\\n\r\nUp first is Seishuu Handa, or \"Sensei\" as he's called by basically everyone.  As a calligrapher, Sensei is similar to any other artist, aspiring to become the best in his field and showcase what his own style and flair is so that he can become a top calligrapher like the years before that were his prime.  The only problem is well...he's a bit immature.  Sensei is a character that doesn't think things through and is quite unaccustomed to his new island life, hence the reason why basically all of the comedic moments revolve around him and his attempts to try and show off his prowess as an adult, which does, if not always, ends in hilarious, hilarious catastrophes.  But what really makes him unique is how he grows.  You can very clearly see the artist struggle in him fade away as he as the story goes along, finds himself.  And it's this journey of self change that really makes the show great.  Not only that, but the relationship that he and Naru share.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Naru, the lovable seven year old girl that is known as the ''Town scamp''.  Naru is a very interesting character as she's shown to be not only to be one of the best tomboys ever known to anime history, but also as a personal friend and guide to Sensei himself.  Naru provides that other half that counteracts Sensei's personality because of how outgoing and loud Naru is, compared to the always reserved and quiet personality of Sensei.  But what really makes disappointed about the series is how we don't truly get to know who Naru is.  We see her personality, we as the audience know what she's like, but compared to Sensei, of whom we know everything about from his from childhood to now, we don't really get to know who Naru is since there is no backstory for her.  We get a theory from Sensei in one episode that perhaps we would get some semblance of what kind of life she has outside of being around Sensei, but we don't get much more than that, which is a shame considering that having two main characters get an absurd amount of character depth would've been very beneficial to the series if done right.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast of Barakamon adds plenty to the table that makes the show interesting with a good number of them being usually one note than anything else.  But the supporting cast is good nonetheless as you can see a good deal of them grow up beside Sensei himself as they accept him more and more a a resident of the island.  Overall, the characters of Barakamon are definitely the show's high point as you get to see character development in more than just one character, making the viewing experience as a whole more enjoyable since there are quite a few memorable characters to be had in this series, making them more like real life people rather than being just animated troupes.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Great main characters\\n\r\n+  Memorable supporting cast \\n\r\n+  Fantastic character development\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (6.99/10 and 7.01/10): Admittedly, the art in this series is not the best. (Kinda like Sensei's calligraphy.)  The series is rather meh in the grand scheme of things but definitely serves its purpose.  The series has no real outstanding qualities to its art style that make it more than just a standard anime look.  It still looks good, don't get me wrong, but really, it's not particularly the best.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the show hosts the all-time favorite exaggerated expressions for characters, and it uses this a lot.  (Especially with Sensei.)  It's the show's own way of describing its comedy moments and it uses them very often as Sensei tries and fails to do things on the island.  It's a good style and fits well with the kind of story this is, but like its standard art style, the show doesn't really have anything fantastic in terms of visuals.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for song tracks, the show hosts an OP and ED which admittedly, sound rather similar.  They both have the loud electric guitar riffs accompanied by drums and a male singer that is singing loudly into his mic.  They don't really sound that different aside from maybe rhythm and a couple chords.  That being said, the songs do reflect on the show's very free feeling of expression as the tracks honestly do match up to the feeling in Barakamon.  They are good, listenable tracks, don't get me wrong, they just sound similar and don't really feel very memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Music that works in conjunction with the show\\n\r\n+/- Meh art (serves its purpose from a visual standpoint)\\n\r\n-  Both the OP and ED sound quite similar\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (8.88/10):  Now, Barakamon.  When I first saw this in the Summer 2014 list, I thought of this show to be an expected gem since no show that I know of has even touched on the idea of calligraphy and it seemed like there would be a show similar to Usagi drop with the relationship between the man and the little girl on the front cover.  I was interested in watching it, but then I sorted of put it on the back burner because SOMEHOW, Glasslip and Blade dance became more important shows to watch.  (I sincerely apologize, Barakamon.  I shouldn't have put those two messes before you.)\\n\\n\r\nDid I like the show?\\n\\n\r\nYES.  Very much so.  Barakamon is a very nicely made, and very relaxing story that weaved in comedy, character development, and plot all in a nice and simply made show.  It's a very easy to follow storyline that, if the show suits your fancy, will be a good afternoon watch.  Good, quality character development is rather hard to find these days, so I'm happy to see something in recent years be something that is so enjoyable and well-crafted.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nThe aesthetics are a bit of a problem for me, but really, they don't hinder the show all that much.  Even if the art isn't fantastic, it's good enough so that it doesn't make any cringing moments that would make you want to turn off your computer scree.  But what really grinds my gears is how little they actually used Naru.  Throughout the whole show, Naru was really but an influence for Sensei.  She didn't really have a story that was hers and hers alone, which really made me a bit sad because I wanted to know more about this seven year old that made such a big impact on one of the most pathetic anime characters I've seen in a long time.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you haven't already, what are you doing, you fools?  Go! GO!  No, but in all seriousness, this is one that I would very highly recommended to watch.  Not only does it make good use of its timeframe by making comedy, plot, and character development blend together in a very good and successful way, but it gives a good feeling to the audience that definitely gives a heartwarming feeling inside.  It's a show that teaches what it means to be yourself, to be the kind of person that only you can become.  Everyone has their own way of doing things and that's truly what makes us who we are.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.36/10",

            "content": "My first review. Never thougt I would review anything, it's not really my thing but after watching this anime I just want as many people as posible to experience what I did, watching this.\r\nAnd that is the feeling of being glued to the screen from 1 to 12 feeling extreme joy, satisfaction and interest in every aspect of this anime despite it not having any action, romance, harem, drama or anything that seems to be the selling point nowdays. I still can't point out what exactly this anime does so amazingly well, but whatever it is, it will make you want more.\r\nStory. (Slight spoilers)\r\nThe storycenters around a troubled calligrapher from Tokyo being forced to move to an island out in the \"sticks\" after getting into some trouble at his work. Being used to living in \"High tech\" Tokyo he is at first not too pleased with living here, especially after finding out his new house is the HQ of a young energetic girl and a couple of high school girls. But he deals with it and continues writing his calligraphy trying to improve. Every day will be a new experience for him as he grows as a calligrapher and a person in these new enviroments.\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is up to date, nothing super flashy or revolutionary, it's just what it is and what it is works.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nPretty much the same as the art, I don't recall anything specially amazing about the sound however it works and blends in well with the story and enviroments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nThis is I belive a big part of the anime, it makes you feel for every character, despite the show only being 12 episodes it gives sufficient background to the entire main cast(Maybe some more then others) and it really attaches you to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nAs I wrote previously, I just went from 1 to 12 with a big smile on my face and a really happy feeling wich is something I find to be very rare. There is not REALLY a lot happening but still it makes you glued to the screen throug every episode. The show uses it's potential for comedy and feels really well too.\\n\\n\r\nNow I know my review probably isn't exactly top tier, if you've made it this far then I genuinly hope I made you atleast a little interested in the show, and if I didn't then do yourself a favour and go watch it anyway!",

            "content": "It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve come across a show that\u2019s really made me question myself and made me consider my outlook on things. Barakamon proved to be a show that was extremely relatable and every single episode was thought-provoking in one way or another. It\u2019s a show that I can describe as being a diamond in the rough- a slice of life show that you will never forget. \r\nBarakamon spans 12 episodes and was released in the summer of 2014. The story revolves around the main character, Handa Seishuu, who goes by as a calligrapher by trade. Seishuu is gifted at what hedoes and takes a lot of pride in his work, so much in fact that there are times where it can really take a toll on him mentally and usually leads to his typically impulsive behaviour. At an art exhibition, he is criticised by the director and then proceeds to punch him in the face. This leads to Seishuu\u2019s father sending him off to an island to cool down and find his own style of calligraphy. Being a city man himself, Seishuu finds adjusting to life on the island a little difficult to say the least. It\u2019s not entirely his fault either- there are some pretty interesting characters on that island! It is this small cast of characters that will really leave a lasting impression as you go through the show and they\u2019re all completely different. \\n\\n\r\nThe first of these characters is Naru, a very bubbly and energetic 6 year old who is always around to play around with Seishuu, not that he wholly approves at the start! She is always up to something or the other and some of the things she comes up with are either wildly wacky or sometimes even rather smart. Her child like approach really gets through to Seishuu and as a character herself she is very likeable. She has her friend Hina, who is just as old as her, although she is the total opposite- a shy, inwards looking person. That isn\u2019t to say that she isn\u2019t also a total handful herself, Hina has a tendency to cry at any given moment and provides an extra bit of comedy in the show. There are some older characters who are also in school who have vastly different personalities who are always around to chip in with some fun. Then you have the villagers themselves who can just seem so out of sorts at times and their way of interacting with Seishuu leads to some comedic moments. All in all the characters are different and varied enough to each make their own little impact on the story, no one ever really feels like they don\u2019t belong there. The show utilises this to extend themes of friendship and communicates this very well- with some incredibly heartfelt moments. Seeing things through the eyes of a child like Naru and how the entire gang slowly make their mark on Seishuu can give you this very warm feeling. \\n\\n\r\nThat isn\u2019t the only theme that this show manages to cover, hanging over the entire show is the theme of success and failure. What does it really mean to succeed in life? Barakamon depicts how difficult it can be to keep your spirits up when everything is going wrong or you\u2019ve just hit a wall. It shows you that picking yourself up and moving on isn\u2019t as easy as people always say. It doesn\u2019t take a flowery view on this but instead keeps both feet firmly on the ground and realistically depicts how reality plays out. It shows that in life when you keep going, keep looking for something to chase, you will eventually get there but not without the ups and downs. The realism in this aspect made it much more relatable. \\n\\n\r\nWhat really stood out for me in this show was how well the setting, the characters and even the sounds were masterfully woven together to create something that in the end you would think was actually truly special. It might feel clich\u00e9d to a minority, it might be obvious where everything is headed at times but what cannot be denied is that despite this how the show moves on and play out each scene. The strongest part of this show is how well it transitions from episode to episode, it never feels as if it is being rushed nor does the pace ever die down. There is always plenty going on to keep you thoroughly engaged- you are never short of some laughter in Barakamon!\\n\\n\r\nWhat I wanted to note specifically was the OP and even more so the ED. The use of soundtrack within the actual episodes is fairly good, nothing that is special enough to be pointed out. However, the OP and ED just give a great sense of opening and ending to the episode, the ED especially can hit home hard after an emotional ending. Personally, it ranks in my top five ED\u2019s of all time. Furthermore, the art style was also to an extremely high standard which helped to enhance the experience. The character designs were cute and to an extent felt like chibi art at certain points in the show but while perhaps there were one or two characters I would have liked to see redesigned, they were all well made. In fact, it was the older characters that I felt were better done as it seemed to chime in more with their characters but then again by that logic the children were pretty well done too. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show left me feeling a little bit hollow inside but also a lot more aware of myself. It is among the purer slice of life shows, one that you really can just sit back and relax with, while laughing along the way. Although the laughs never take away from the deeper bigger picture this show tries to get across. Thoroughly enjoyable show a must watch. If you enjoy this show or are looking for something a bit similar, I would recommend that you watch \u201cAnohana\u201d or \u201cClannad\u201d, the latter is considered to be one of the best slice of life shows ever made (but that\u2019s down to you!)\\n\\n\r\nFinal rating 9.2\\n\\n\r\nTukky12\\n\r\n=)\\n",

            "content": "If done right, even simple stories can provide great enjoyment.\r\nBarakamon was a really pleasant surprise for me. I went into it without expecting much, but little did I know! With a simple, yet charming and beautiful story, a big palette of jokes, great variety of outstanding characters and interesting, authentic interactions between them, Barakamon manages to capture everyone's heart. Let me briefly break it down...\r\nAs a comedy anime Barakamon has a lot to offer. The humor is pretty good and it doesn't rely on stupid, overused jokes or in tropes.\r\nThe characters is probably the strongest point of the anime.  If I could describe themwith one word, it would be human. They are authentic, real, they behave like a normal man/woman would in their position. The children are carefree and cheerful, the teens are laid back but sometimes sceptical, the adults are trying to face their problems in life in their own ways. What's more, the interactions between the characters are some of the best and most real and enjoyable I've seen in any anime.\\n\r\nVisuals are pretty nice but nothing special here. As for the sound and music, I found it pleasant and fitting with the Opening theme sticking with me for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nWhat surprised me is how you can find yourself in this anime and identify with the main character. By living a more laid back and relaxing life in a remote island he can see things he couldn't see under the pressure of a big city. He can appreciate and treasure every moment, even the little things. He understands what is important and what isn't. And that should be a lesson to all of us.",

            "content": "Barakamon was the end to my summer anime endeavors and I was incredibly pleased with the amount of life, heart and value I found in its story. The entire atmosphere of the show was such a homely, comforting experience, one that so enjoyable and I expect to continue to be so should I ever decide to give it another run through.\r\nThe story is that of the impulsive calligrapher Handa Seishuu, referred to as Sensei throughout the series, and his journey of finding himself in his work--a wonderful balance is created between this end of the plot and the comedic situations encountered, those of which keepBarakamon so light. \\n\r\nWhile animes of the slice of life genre are usually limited to fragmented pieces of encounters, Barakamon is very on point in its presentation of these separate events. The introduction of characters over time is steady and interesting in a way that avoids the usual cliches (i.e., protag. gets into fight with someone, protag. meets potential love interest, etc. etc.). As well, the anime focuses on a country lifestyle, similar to Non Non Biyori, and yet Barakamon contrarily keeps events to a standard that avoids the viewers' boredom. \\n\\n\r\nMuch of this is to the credit of the show's cast of children, all of whom wholeheartedly represent the youth that is so often replaced for shameless moe aspects. Sensei himself has a certain childishness that mixes well with the cast of elementary and middle school kids, all of whom are so diverse. There are the children that cling, the children that cry, the children who are ahead of their time, and all react to each other so natural that the whole adventure is the definition of comfortable.\\n\r\nIt is especially the relationship between Sensei and the children that makes the anime so stupendous. Their interactions contain so much life and so much heart to them, and the separation of screen time is done in such a fashion that each character gets their moment. Best of all, the over-branching natural feel is something to note, as it is the perfect balance between the appeal of fiction and the experiences we hold in our memories.\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon is exactly that--a collection of memories that are so very reminiscent of the ones we ourselves hold close. Often there is a disconnect where one cannot relate to the panty shots and the hyperbolic reactions of the anime world; with Barakamon, real life is renewed in an entertaining way, one given just the right episode count and just the right set of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very relaxing, relating back to Sensei's background as a calligraphist. Where Glasslip failed in terms of creating an artist atmosphere, Barakamon succeeded, making lines soft and unique like that of the calligraphy. The line work is comfortable and is complemented by a natural color palette. Any exaggerated faces are placed well for the moment, and the backgrounds throughout the series are well done, especially for the island aesthetic.\\n\\n\r\nSound throughout the series suits its characters, which is good seeing as the characters are most definitely one of the selling points of the show. The OP continues in Barakamon's good streak of balance, displaying the correct amount of power and softness, and is one worth listening to every once and a while; the case is similar with the ED, providing a calming ending to the episode's events.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the color, the characters and the unique elements of Barakamon come together to form a memorable summer show, while it is not the most psychological or action packed. The balance of humor and realism tap into the core of humanity and what makes life an experience. Subsequently, Barakamon is also an experience, life and humanity and memories contained within a dozen episodes.",

            "content": "It's not an easy task to make an interesting story about a calligrapher and the fact that Barakamon pulled it off is simply amazing. the whole thing is about the power of inspiration and to some extent non conformism. the protagonist tries to learn the true meaning of life from things around him and whenever he is inspired you feel inspired as well so what you can expect from Barakamon is a light but smart emotional ride.\r\nSeishuu Handa a famous calligrapher with a respected style is on the path to find his own calligraphy thanks to an accident that forced him to leave his cityand to live in a village to rethink his life. as you can expect the village is filled with bunch of weird people and Handa gets inspired by the way they live and think so another aspect of the story is simplicity. it focuses on it even more with introducing Naru, a wild brat that befriends Handa and through her simplicity Handa learns lots of things and we get to see the brilliance of a child's mind. also as it happens Handa is a natural with kids so he is always surrounded with a bunch of them. while the story is mostly presented episodically (stories feel separated) there is a good flow and each section got tied with others pretty well and if you didn't read the manga sometimes you probably won't notice that they just attached different events and mixed things. it is also sweet to see how Handa improves himself with anything even remotely related to Calligraphy (Writing on a boat with Brush)\\n\\n\r\nSadly because the anime is only 12 episodes they had to cut some of the stuff and that created some small problems specially with characters. there is a good amount of characters in the story and the anime doesn't have the time to focus on all of them. for example you get too see the teacher dude in the main story only in Episode 1 and after that he just make appearances in scenes after the credit.characters might not be unique and you might even forgot most of them after a while but they are well thought and real. they have their desires, characteristics and some of them grow along with the protagonist which is one of the strong points of Barakamon. so naturally expect a good amount of growth from Handa while he still stays the same person.\\n\\n\r\nthe animation quality is good but it is not anything special and character designs are mostly true to their original design (except for...for example Miwa, they probably changed her skin tone so people don't confuse her with Tama...). voice acting is pretty strong and i really like Daisuke Ono in this one and he shows he can handle anything thrown at him. although voice acting sometimes can feel off and sometimes it doesn't match character's expressions but overall it's great and obviously it is opinion based.\\n\\n\r\nall and all Barakamon along with Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun are best comedies of Summer 2014 and if you are into emotional yet light stories i strongly suggest Barakamon. as i mentioned making an story focusing on calligraphy is hard and keeping the reader/viewer interested is even harder but you don't have to worry about that here.",

            "content": "disclaimer: this review is atypical in that it examines more of a conflict between anime vs live action medium as a whole rather than what is inherently wrong in the series.\r\nBarakamon is either sophisticated & unique OR boring and not worth a second watch at all. You'll think the former if you EXCLUSIVELY watch and is a HUGE fan of anime. You'll think the latter if you actually appreciate other forms of visual medium (American tv shows, K/J drama, Hollywood/European/Asian cinema). \r\nHere's the problem: if you're a frequent watcher of live action films, you'll know that this premise--a pompous/ empty city boy gets secluded/ostracized tothe rural areas where he learns the life of the farm folk and learns about himself--has been done so. many. times. In fact, I can think of an international film (South Korean I think) that almost has this exact premise. And you know what? that film did better with more flare and emotion in 2 hours than this entire series. And it's not the anime's fault. It simply is the advantage and power of a live action movie. \\n\\n\r\nAnime is an unrealistic medium (that's why, infamously, anime can't pull off a good horror series 99% of the time). So when you add \"anime qualities\" in a story that clearly belongs in the live action realm, many aspects seem boring, bland, and unnecessary. Throughout the anime, I found myself constantly asking why is x character here for? You should be taking advantage of what is unique to anime by incorporating unrealism to the series. Sometimes, it's the silliness and the facial emotions and settings and stories that detach from reality that would otherwise look extremely awkward in live actions that I appreciate about anime. I applaud that Barakamon tried to carve out its own lane and it WILL be a pleasant surprise to anime-only watchers but to me, it stretched its boundaries too much. \\n\r\nI'm not sure if people will understand so I'll leave you with this: Think of a great live action film. I'm confident that, if you were to imagine the film remade into a 2D anime series, you won't feel the same excitement as much. That's how I feel about Barakamon. I came to this series already exposed to many great live action films about this exact premise. (converse isn't true: a great anime series can generate both good and horrible live actions)\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I really liked was Naru. I liked that he was \"actually a kid.\" Sometimes both anime and films use a cheap trick in which the plot moves forward by having a kid suddenly blurt out dialogue so eye-opening and mature that it changes an adult protagonist. It almost always seems forced and I'm glad that the relationship between Naru and Handa felt much more organic relatively. I also loved Naru's voice actress--a somewhat husky yet still playful voice that I found very fresh. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack was forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, from other reviews, I can tell that Barakamon suffers from what I call the \"reverse-Michael Bay effect\" -- to warrant any series/film a good rating just because it rejected needless action/explosions/fantasy materials. These qualities of course don't necessarily make a good film but the sheer absence of these doesn't make a good series either. Barakmon suffers from extreme blandness that comes from a lack of originality without effort to add their own twist. I see many people who praise this anime for being able to stand on its own without magical girls/fan service/ and amazing action sequences. Honestly, Barakamon could've used some of those because it certainly wasn't exceptional in the story/emotional impact division.",

Unless you thought this was an action/romance anime instead of a slice of life, there's no way one could be disappointed in this lighthearted, fun series. \r\nI see Barakamon as one of those animes you watch in between the really intense ones. It's a good break, it has excellent humor, and it leaves you feeling happy inside. The main reason being the main girl, Naru. Naru is a little country-hick kid who befriends a city-dude Seishuu Handa. He's a career driven guy who has no time for fun andgames. She's a little girl who's very existence means fun and games. Put the two together, and you get a wonderful comedy with just the right amount touchy-feely emotions. \\n\\n\r\nShe teaches him to love life, in a beautiful way. This anime is simple, there's no doubt about that. I feel like the simplicity of it is what makes it so good. That, and Naru. She's hilarious. Seriously man, I laughed a lot watching this. She's also beyond adorable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "Anime Series Review No.5\r\nWe got this Slice of Life and Comedy genre title Barakamon and I will tell yah how much I enjoy watching this series and finish it less than a day by the enjoyment it holds for it is a success in making it genre a real slice of life anime of the year. Comedy is balance with the mood. I will now make my preview in the following aspect of the show in which what make it stand out.\r\nStory 8/10\r\n The story is simple and easy to get. No need to pay attention on every dialogue, no need to wrap your mindto it and no need to think deeply about it. You just need to relate to the characters and you will understand it clearly. This suppose to be how slice of life should be. It's no drama to drown yourself in emotion but rather feel the emotional relief and happiness about the little things in life and appreciate it. This is why Barakamon's Plot simply delivered this properly and handle it logically and with a sense. The only thing why I didn't raise the rate to 9 for sometimes I get annoyed with some humors but in majority I like the logical humor of barakamon and especially the short precious moments it gives which wanna make you live more positively. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThe scenery is standard for a slice of life series but still the scenery did a good job in reflecting the smoothing atmosphere of the country side of japan. The art style for the ending Innocence is great in giving feeling of relaxation.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe Opening theme of the series is ok nothing much to say but it does bring a hint of adventure about Handa and Naru's character interaction make you won't stop watching. Ending \"Innocence\" is a great ending for it really depicts that the anime is a slice of life and straight forward to the story's theme. I really appreciated the soundtrack and the background music. The sound doesn't go deep in the emotion but it does make you feel refresh and happy just by hearing it. The voice acting of the children here is a huge praise for they speak normally. I really get irritated when other anime put children and make them act and speak cute which is not how kids really do they too get embarrassed about it. It's the truth trust me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nWhy do Barakamon became so good it's not because of Naru which those pedophiles called loli fan service but because the character stand out and establish their role's normally. How many slice of life series did I see made a fan service out of their female characters and always made them wear swimsuit and other indecent clothes and cosplay in some degrees. Always making the leading male character always cool and get bitch slap by the girl and eventually getting an harem for he is being the model man. You won't see it here. Nope! This why Barakamon is better. All the characters act normal meaning they act as real people thought they can be childish at time to time but the characters are still likable. The elders have fair screen time and have great purpose in supporting the main characters struggles in the his new life. They did a great presentation of how living in the countryside in Japan is and how intellectual smart they are. I like the friendly traditions, the customs and the way of living of the folks there. I like the decent manner they have in respecting elders and the person older than them. There are so many good points in the characters of the show the I can point out in the series but when I have improve my writing skill I will do my best to point out this things. I am still a novice in review writing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nI'am going rate this anime by personal scoring 10/10 or 9/10 I will give but this is MAL must be reasonable in my rate statistically as possible. I will reveal my way in rating anime in my own statistical way later on when I make more previews.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)|\\n\r\nMy Highest rate so far in an anime series when I made this preview.  The series recommendable to non-anime fans which mean the anime is very good and can capture a huge audition.",

This anime gave me happy, almost nostalgic feelings when I watched it and I was sad when it finished. The artwork is beautiful and had a light, airy feeling. The main character, Hanada, is at times awkward and insecure, but in a relatable, likeable way. The real star of the show is the little girl named Naru, who had me laughing the entire time! I loved Hanada's affectionfor her, and how she caused him to grow. I wish there were more episodes, and I plan on reading the manga, which is ongoing. If you are considering watching this anime, go ahead and give it a try... you won't be disappointed! Oh, and if it matters at all I loved the opening and ending songs; they were so pretty!",

            "content": "I have finally made the right choice to send off summer 2014. If you are wondering why I didn't review the remaining anime that I have watched is because I have nothing interesting to say and I always repeat myself every time I do that, which is frustrating. So to end summer 2014 on a good note, I decided to review Barakamon, the #1 anime of summer 2014, in my opinion. \r\nSTORY (10):\r\nThe story follows Seishu Handa, a calligrapher expert, who was sent to Goto Island, near Kyushu, after having a feud with an elderly curator due to the fact that Seishu Handa couldn't takecriticism from him. From there, Seishu Handa, develops a relationship with the group from Goto Island. \\n\\n\r\nThe story has its funny and sad moments bundled together. Just like the korean movie that I had watched which was \"My Teacher, Mr. Kim\". \\n\\n\r\nART (9):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is excellent.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (10):\\n\\n\r\nThe melody of the song fits in well. Like when there is sad moments, the tune is sad. Likewise if there are funny moments, the tune is exciting. It sets the mood perfectly. The opening and ending are addictive.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (10):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well-fleshed out and have ample time of development. \\n\\n\r\nSeishu Handa was my favorite character. He reminded me so much of Hachiman Hikigaya from Oregairu, in a better way. Seishu Handa was the type of character who is determined, optimistic, wise, everything that I wanted from him. Daisuke Ono did a good job in portraying the voice of Seishu Handa. I did like his character development the best, it shows that he learns his mistake by improving as a character from there on.\\n\\n\r\nNaru Kotoshi was the best comic relief character. She brings joy to the cast especially form a strong bond with Seishu Handa. She is also funny when she does all those funny faces.\\n\\n\r\nHiroshi Kido was also an interesting character. He prepares food for the gang and he is also a likeable person.\\n\\n\r\nTamako and Miya were both interesting characters and I like the way how they support Seishu in what he does.\\n\\n\r\nI also did like most of the cast but none of the stand out compared to the characters that I have mentioned. I wish these characters would at least have some development so that I can give them the better recognition.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (10):\\n\\n\r\nThis anime broke my heart for the 1st time I watched because I felt for the characters. This anime also teaches us a lot of quotes like\\n\\n\r\n\"A hero lies in everyone\"\\n\r\n\"Everyone has different talents\"\\n\r\n\"Learning is a journey, not a destination\"\\n\\n\r\nLearning is a journey, and because we learn and develop by observing our mistakes and learn from there. Especially when it comes to criticism. If we want to become better, we have to take criticism so that we can improve and become better persons in the near future. \\n\\n\r\nI will never regret watching Barakamon. I enjoyed this anime to the fullest. I love the comedic moments and the emotional moments this anime has bundled together. The chemistry and bond between characters are strong and I love this anime to death. Barakamon will forever stay true in my heart and so I give this anime a 10/10. 2 thumps up.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love slice-of-life, please watch this anime. You will feel all the emotions in this anime.",

            "content": "Summary(If you don't want detailed analysis) : Barakamon is just one of those anime that makes you feel happy inside, the characters are lovable, the art is beautiful despite the story being a bit lacking in conclusion. Although this is a slice of life anime, so that's to be expected. The overall environment brought by Barakamon really gives a warmth to the viewers heart. When you see everyone in the small village pitching in when someone needs help, it really makes you think that living in somewhere like that would be paradise.\r\n*Edit*: After re-watching this anime I realized that the anime really is a greatfeel-good anime and probably my favorite slice of life anime ever.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story of Barakamon isn't that great, like most slice of life anime. The calligraphy part is really interesting though, and a unique spin on the slice of life genre. The story leaves in an open ended style which could be good and could be bad depending, although the story really isn't what makes this anime so great.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in Barakamon is really amazing, Seishuu Handa is a really good calligrapher. (Oh God that joke was bad) Jokes aside, all the characters look amazing in the anime and the scenery also looks nice. Since it is in the country the art is able to capture the trees, insects and the buildings really nicely and in my opinion Barakamon has one of the best art styles of all time.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack of Barakamon has a really cheerful part to it. It is sort of similar to My Neighbor Totoro, in terms of the soundtrack, but also has its own unique parts to it. It is one of those soundtracks that you would want to play in the background of your life.\\n\r\n9/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: In my opinion characters are really the make of break of an anime for me. In Barakamon the characters are its strongest suite. Over the course of the anime all of the characters develop around each other and learn from each other. This really makes the anime all that much better. Character development in this anime goes at a good pace and makes you fall in love with the characters, and feel empathy and joy alongside them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Overall Barakamon is probably my favorite slice of life anime and made it to my top 3 favorites of all time. Sometimes I feel like newer anime is just generic and already been done 1000 times. But it's anime like this that  are the reason I watch anime. \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating 10/10",

            "content": "Story & Characters:\r\nBarakamon is an absolute gem and deserves every bit of praise and popularity that it gets. The way it builds its world and characters is nothing short of magic, weaving a big but lovable cast of three dimensional humans who are just living out their mundane lives and through doing so, gradually discover new things about themselves. Character interactions and dynamics are extremely entertaining, oftentimes heartwarming. Its not so much the setting as it is the characters that make this show, and fuck me if the characters aren't believable, well written, and well developed. There's not much else I can say about Barakamon'ssimple but immensely enjoyable story because that's the magic of Barakamon: its premise is deceptively unimpressive on paper, but once you start watching it, you will feel the effectiveness of its writing seep through your very soul, and be reminded once again of why you even started watching anime as an entertainment medium in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nKinema Citrus did an amazing job with its character designs, animation, and color palette - everything on the island looks vibrant and full of life. The facial expressions are all perfect and convey all the right emotions at all the right times. It's truly great stuff.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nBoth the openings and endings are topgun. They perfectly capture the show's joyful energy and sense of wonder. The background tracks that play during each episode are usually very mellow and easy-going, fitting right in with the mood of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nJust sit back, relax, and feel the magic of Barakamon's simple but profound and touching writing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n10/10 very few slice-of-life shows have managed to contain as much heart and soul and Barakamon, and I doubt we will see anything so deep and genuine like it again for a quite a long time.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I will start by stating Barakamon is a great anime. I know the term is used very often these days but trust me when I say it has \"a one of a kind\" type of quality to it. I took up this show on a suggestion of a friend and it was a pure pleasure to watch it. The only downside is that it only lasted 12 episodes (so far). I will make my review spoiler free :)\r\nThe story aspect is very well thought out. The progression feels very natural and content. The comedy is a class on its own mostly due to its integrationof a difference in dialect, a small girls who misunderstands a lot, and the various well written main and side characters. The setting of the plot gives the story a larger room to roam thus creating a great environment for a comedy slice of life show. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in my opinion is great. I gave it a 9/10 even though the amount of detail isn't very high such as Hyouka but the the art of the main character writing calligraphy is great to watch. The art styling of the characters are also pleasant to watch and felt very natural in its settings. Art was a very important aspect in a show like this and they pulled it off without a hitch. \\n\\n\r\nFor the sound I give it a 9/10 as well I know I seem to be rating it very high but if you do listen to the soundtrack individually you will see the amount of details put into each tune. I loved the opening sequence music as well as the opening sequence as a whole. The whole sound track feels very at home with the show and does not feel out of place. It blends well with the scenes and at most times it is very subtle but it creates the right atmosphere all the time. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the best part about the show. The characters were an absolute delight to watch! I loved Naru (the little girl) her childlike curiosities, her mannerism, her comedic timing, her thoughtfulness, her ideals, and the innocence is such a joy to watch. The main character Handa (calligrapher) was also very well written. He has the most amount of character growth throughout the series (which is obvious since he is the main guy) but they don't rush his growth. They acknowledge that even with enlightenment there can be downfalls which I feel was a very human trait missing in many shows. His progression throughout the show was great to watch and his comedic essence was great! The side characters such as Miwa, Tama, and Hiroshi provided great laughs as well as brought out the best in the main character at times. Their drive and integration into the show provided many memorable moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment throughout the entire series was very very good. Outstanding! The laughs that will cause you to catch your breath and stomachs to burst are aplenty. The understanding and bonds formed between all the characters are a pleasure to watch. The enlightenment in life lived was very raw, down to earth and relate-able. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I thoroughly enjoyed this series. It was a great treat to watch and because of my sheer enjoyment of it I decided to write a review regarding it. I hope it provides as much joy to you as it did to me. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my second review please do let me know how I can improve on my review writing. Thank you and enjoy! :)\\n",

            "content": "You can't produce good things of you are not happy in your life. And moreover, you will produce better things if you have a good feeling in what you do.\r\nThat's the spirit of the anime. Reality is not quite far from that, of course others things have to be takes in considerations.\r\nWell anyway. I'll write the script, without spoilers (maybe I have to really go deeper in the detail to spoil, thing that I'm not going to do obviously).\r\nSeishu Handa, more known as Sensei in the show, is the principal character. He practices calligraphy, in Tokyo. The story start when he punch the conservator ofthe museum, which said that his calligraphic is basic, no story in it (and you know, all the things that \"specialists\" can detect in the art of someone). His father decides to launch him on the Goto isle, to keep out all these things of his mind, and decompress a bit.\\n\r\nOn this isle, he will discover all the people who live here. This is a small village, so you know, the difference is pretty hard (at the beginning he can't even understand what people are saying).\\n\r\nHe also continues to do calligraphy, and try to take the first place in the expositions.\\n\r\nSo, during the show, we see him with all the people in the village, and his progression in his work.\\n\\n\r\nI appreciate this show. Of course it's really more funny than serious, but I think there also is some work by the author on the messages that he wanted to share. And... Well, it's a success. I mean, it's not boring to watch, you laugh a bit, and you take good time.\\n\r\nSo, why 7? Because for me 7 isn't a bad mark (1 is a bad mark), and I think there's nothing transcendent in this show, it's not very impressive. You'll not say \"WOAAA\" when something happen, because... Because you will not be surprised at all maybe.\\n\\n\r\nLet's see a bit in details.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nIt comes from a good idea. And it's a good idea. But the script just takes twenty lines, maybe not more. You'll not be exciting to see what will going on after each episode, like in Steins;Gate for example (of course this is two different category). It's a good story, nothing more, nothing less.\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nWell, I'm forced to say that it's a good point of the show. It's well designed. You'll like to watch it, because it's pretty good.\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI really liked the opening! At the moment when I wrote these lines, I have it in my head! It's a good music, and I think it fit well the theme of the show. The ending is also good, but I have no feeling like I have with the opening.\\n\r\nFor the rest of the sound, it's good enough.\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nMost of the characters are adolescents. It's interesting and it gives a funny part to the anime. Sensei has also a good behaviour, a bit classic, but it's not bad.\\n\r\nAt least there's nothing really impressive. That's why I put 7.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nWell, it was good! It's a bit hilarious; there are some good scenes that I will remember maybe. It makes me thinking a bit. Because I really think that the author wants to give to the spectator some messages, like I said in the beginning. And also that you need one thing in your life to be happy: friends. No importance to who they are, how they are. If you appreciate them and have good times with them, stay with them.\\n\r\nI think this show succeed well to give to the spectator this impression, that's why I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are sceptical, maybe you should not. If you like funny shows, and if you don't have like 3000 show to see, you can go for it. Also if you want to take a break between two serious shows, go for it you won't be disappointed I think.\\n\\n\r\nBut trust me about one thing: make up your own opinion by watching this show. Don\u2019t believe everyone. \\n",

            "content": "You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough. Because in the end, we only regret the chances we didn't take.\r\nBarakamon is an anime full of comedy that will surprise you. I'd been looking forward to seeing the series since it came out. Who could have guessed that this anime will hold my interest? I'm always looking for a masterpiece anime to watch, but anime series nowadays lack the urgency and thematic depth to show. Barakamon, on the other hand, is a good example of the opposite.\r\nStory \r\nThis story is about Seishuu Handa (voiced by Daisuke Ono), a young man fullof enthusiasm for his job as a calligrapher. Because of his artistic skill, he has quite a big ego. His work is considered to be perfect since Handa has outstanding talent. Things get quite interesting when the director of an exhibition criticizes his work for lacking a personal touch and not being as great as Handa expected. This is when Handa loses his temper and delivers a rage-filled punch to the old man. As a result, Handa is sent to an island near Kyushu to cool down and take a break from his work as a calligrapher. His father has a house built on that island. As soon as he arrives at the Goto Island, he is already welcomed by a tomboyish little girl named Naru who has been staying at the house all this time. Here, Handa who had thought of himself as perfect and did not allow other people to try fix his life or do something about his temper slowly grows into fixing it by himself. Living on the island turns out to be a good lesson for Handa.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \\n\r\nHanda is actually a good person but lacks determination as he doesn't really have a friend besides his family and one best friend who didn't expect him to be successful as a calligrapher at first. Indeed, Handa could be considered perfect since he is good-looking, wealthy, and living a dream. A lack of hardship as well as having no real friends is probably a factor as to why Handa doesn't pay attention to attitude or behavior. Handa began to trust only his own opinion and cast out others from his life. Thus, Handa has a hard time when it comes to dealing with others and finds it frustrating. As the story goes on, Handa's behavior is sometimes more immature than Naru's. Handa acts like a kid who doesn\u2019t need help from his parents, and yet Handa becomes a real man by the end of series. Eventually, Handa's personality begins to soften and he becomes gentle to others. The island's population is small but they all act like one big family. Handa finds out that it is nice to have people to rely on which also inspires him to be a better person and a better calligrapher.\\n\\n\r\nNaru, who also finds Handa quite interesting as he just arrived on the island, is slowly trying to become his close friend even though she's still a kid. The kid always hangs out around Handa and follows him every chance she gets. I also find it refreshing how villagers of all ages accept Handa without prejudice even though Hiroshi (a high school student) thinks he is just a pretty face but actually worthless. Nevertheless, kids, old men, high school students and people of every gender become close to Handa in no time. This is kind of training for Handa to achieve his dream and to improve his behavior and attitude. Since, yeah, even if you're angry, do you punch some helpless old man? It becomes quite dramatic. I even shed tears. Yes, sad tears - I cried because of the sadness that built up in me. I felt like it reflected me who didn't feel anything at first but if you really think about it, it feels just like a punch to your parent. If your parent is being punched by someone, can you still sit and watch without feeling anything? That's more than enough of a reason for me to feel guilty, I can't bear it. Well, enough of me being a crybaby and back to the main story. Handa gets into sticky situation after sticky situation with Naru, Hiroshi and the high school student girls as long as he in the island. At the end of the series, it's not only Handa who learn from his mistake, yes, I am talking about myself, too. I need to build up more attitudes myself. This is what I call learning while watching. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall \\n\r\nI found this series' concept to be pretty amazing. It teaches you how to behave towards people who are older than you. Not like some people out there who don't give a damn over this matter. I, without a doubt, found it really interesting. I really enjoyed the series from episode one but it's all thanks to the good work of the producers. They have successfully created a good anime series. This series is also quite entertaining since I always laugh out during each episode at the characters' behavior. A good anime with a lot of creativity here. You'll feel like wanting to watch it again. Handa's mother will also play an important part later on and it's of the funniest parts. Enjoy it to your heart's content. Also make sure you have a tissue paper, too. Believe me, Barakamon is the winner of this season. Barakamon does such a good job showing both the funny and serious aspects of life. I have no regrets after watching the series. I actually found it quite fun to watch. Personally, I'm considering Barakamon to be one of my favorite shows of all time. This series is certainly outrageous anime that is more than meets the eye. Highly recommended to all anime fans. \\n\\n",

I truly did not expect an anime about writing calligraphy to be such a fun and worthwhile watch.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story is quite refreshing, after so many animes being either 1) WE GOTTA SAVE THE WORLD OMG!! or 2) just plain ridiculous.\r\nThe story feels like it could really happen, and the only problem I could find was that it felt a bit hurried along. Following Handa's misadventures on the island feels natural, and very heartwarming. The ending almost brought a tear to my eye. \r\nArt:8\\n\r\nThe art is pretty average, but the calligraphy seems to pop right off the screen. The ED in particular has very good animation, and the entire anime has pretty detailed characters and backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\r\nThe voices were pretty well picked, and they all deliver pretty well, without sounding strained. The OP and ED weren't my favourites, but they are pretty good, with excellent lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThe characters are very well written, and the all interact very naturally with each other. Watching Handa's development was very worthwhile, and he truly emerges a different person by the end of the anime. I truly identify with Handa, and I expect many people would too. The other characters stick well to their identities, with each character having their own lesson to impart to Handa. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis anime is one that I enjoyed thoroughly, from start to end. Sometimes the comedy feels a bit forced, but then it's quickly covered by the truly touching moments between Handa and the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9\\n\r\nThis anime is veritably one of this season's finest, and really manages to stand apart from the rest. Everyone should watch it, if they have the time. \\n",

As a slice of life anime it is pretty much an \"ideal\".\r\n2)Fabulous setting and story:The story is unique yet common.It is shown in a funny way but with the truth of our true fights with our true self.People tend to forget what's important and this anime pretty much bring it in front of our eyes.\r\n3)Lovable characters:Personally I think this is it's strongest point. Hanada-sensei as a genius-yet-lonercalligrapher who hit an old man because he bad-mouthed his calligraphy, Naru - a cheerful(too much but in a cute and funny way) kid who is the heart of this show and many more.\\n\\n\r\n4)Music-OP & ED were beautifully composed and written ,totally in accordance with the anime plot.\\n\\n\r\nAlright so i have pointed out some good points about it but everything has a bad side so I would also like to point them out:\\n\\n\r\n1)It is a simple story.If you are not interested in life-philosophy stuff then this anime is not something you are looking for now.\\n\\n\r\n2)It's a breather type of anime so if you are not looking for something refreshing you should skip it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I would like to suggest one thing that you must see this anime one time or add to your \"to watch list\".It is a type of manga which might motivate about life more.\\n\r\nSo that's that.\\n\\n\r\nResult:Strongly recommended.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Barakamon is a wonderful anime, and is probably the best example of how to do a good slice of life anime.\r\nStory: 9\r\nBarakamon's plot revolves around the struggles of a young, but popular calligrapher, who is forced to go to a small island when he punches the head of a calligraphy exhibition. The story largely follows his path towards maturity, and his relationship with the islanders. The anime is slow and calm, and the story rarely escapes it's tendency to use a situation each episode to deliver a lesson involving tenacity and inspiration when creating something. For the most part, the story is about character interactionsand growth, so most episodes don't have anything too significant happen.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art in Barakamon is great. All of the characters are fluid and expressive, and some of the scenery is gorgeous. The art style often looks similar to a painting, but isn't very different or unusual. The arts weakest point is that while some scenes are wonderful, plenty if them are pretty average, and they resort to using completely white eyes and other common anime gags a little too often, still it isn't distracting or obtrusive.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe op and ed are fantastic. The soundtrack itself is good, but nothing really stands out and it can get repetitive. The sound design is about as good as a slice of life could need to be. The voice acting is all great, and no one feels out of place or awkward.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEasily the best part of this anime is it's characters. Almost every character gets good characterization, and no one feels particularly shallow or stereotypical. The main character gets the clearest amount of growth and depth, but a surprising amount of the side characters get plenty of screen time to grow and build their character. The changes the main character goes through are very relatable, and his path towards finding his inspiration is very fun to watch and follow.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 \\n\r\nThere's little to be said here other than that each episode is both funny, and intriguing. There are no moments that aren't fun and engaging.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 \\n\r\nThe only real thing keeping this from being a 10 is the lack of something truly outstanding. Everything is done wonderfully, and there are no large problems or flaws in this anime. A perfect example of the absolute best a single season slice of life can be.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It's a feel-good story about a calligraphy artist who is sent to a remote island off the coast of Japan and how the character's life changed while he was there. And change it did. \r\nStory: 9/10 - Okay, when I first heard about this anime I wasn't exactly sure how I would enjoy it. If done wrong, it could've become boring, but the pace of the anime almost seemed fast - which is kind of funny due to the slice of life genre.\r\nArt: 9/10 - Wonderful. The art perfectly suited the story thatwas being told. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 - When I think of who the anime producers cast for the anime I found that I was pleasantly surprised. All of the voices suited each character down to the T. That alone made the overall rating bump up for me. Also, the great soundtrack boosted the feeling throughout the series!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 - Wow! Just Wow! I don't think I've ever come across an anime where I have liked every single one of the characters! Each were so diverse and completely crazy in their own way: from the annoying little girl, to the reserved boy, to the messy but loveable teen. Everyone had their role in this anime and played it exceedingly well! Their interactions with the main character really made this story come alive.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 - What can I say...enjoyment level to the max!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 - If you want a feel-good, make you smile anime...this is the one for you! With the fantastic: soundtrack, characters, and storyline; Barakamon is one for the books. One to watch when you're feeling down; or just to see whenever you feel like it! Such a fantastic series! :)",

            "content": "\"Barakamon\" is a sweet anime about what it takes to really grow and mature.\r\n\"\ufeffBarakamon\" is a heartwarming slice of life that turned out to be very unique in that it centered around an adult finding his place in the world.  It was cute, comedic, and filled with very fun moments.\r\nMeet Handa, Seishuu, an impulsive temperamental twenty-three year old who decided it was a good idea to punch a famous caligrapher for insulting his work. As punishment, Seishuu is sent off to a small island and forced to adapt to his new wacky neighbors, like people traveling on a tractor, unwanted visitors who never usethe front door, annoying kids using his home as a playground, etc. Can this city guy handle all the crazy hardships? Find out in this wacky island comedy full of innocence and laughter!\\n\\n\r\nDaisuke Ono (Sebastian [Black Butler]) strikes again, voicing Sieshuu! Only, this character isn't the sexy butler that everyone may be aware of. Oh no. Seishuu is a wimp, a city boy through and through. Ono perfectly plays the part of this character through all of Seishuu's stutterings and panic attacks. Moving on, sweet nine year old Suzuko Hara plays the fearless, but adorable Naru. This girl doesn't even sound like she's nine. She sounds like she's a grownup who can sound like a nine year old, that's how good she is. Looking forward to more work from Hara!\\n\\n\r\nIn short, I loved this anime. Not a lot of animes make me laugh, but this one was filled with so many ridiculous moments, I couldn't help but laugh! The art style was nice and clear, and so very detailed! The music in the anime was sweet and filled me with this warm fuzzy feeling. The pacing was perfect, and I didn't have any questioning thoughts or worries.\\n\\n\r\nYou you feel like watching a simple, funny, yet sweet anime, the Barakamon is the one for you! If you're more of an action, fast paced lover, then you might not like this, but I suggest giving it a try. It is truly a cute series, and very lovable.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nThe story line was great, following a grown man throughout his trials and errors as a calligraphist. I got to see him grow, as well as become friends with all the odd people on the island. To my knowledge, there isn't any plot holes. This anime was very well done.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe art is sweet, refreshing, and very detailed. The hair has so many strands! The backgrounds are just gorgeous and radiate a glowing sunny look. The art just makes me feel happy.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 9\\n\r\nThe music was very cute and quirky, fitting the atmosphere of the anime very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nThe characters were very well developed. I'd like to have known more about Seishuu's family and the calligrapher he punched, but that may just be me getting picky.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nI don't think there was an episode in which I didn't laugh. Seishuu has to win the 'Funniest Character of the Season' trophy. If there is no such thing, it needs to be made. And if he doesn't win it, then I'm flipping a few dozen tables.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8.4\\n\r\nThis anime was definitely one of the highlights this season. It made me happy on even the cloudiest of days, and never failed to give off that sweet and soothing feeling of fellowship and friendship.",

Normally I don't really care for slice of life type anime, and I find the portrayal of children in anime often distasteful. \r\nThis anime is different. While it is not the best anime I've ever seen, it is very high on my list simply for its profundity and dedication to realism. In every scene, this anime intentionally draws realistic characters in believable situations and weaves their escapades into a thought-provoking consideration about what we value and why. Iappreciated the cultural notes as well; this anime is not westernized and viewers gain a lot of cultural richness. This anime feels like a place I could step into and find my purpose in life. I would watch again, and might force friends to watch if they had nothing better to do.",

The way each character learns, grows, and interacts is what makes this show really touching. The kids feel like kids, the adults feel like adults. Humor is used nearly flawlessly throughout the show, andthe way a normal day can be made so eventful through silly antics, and cute interactions was quite impressive.

            "content": "Barakamon is one of those series that best show the simplicity of life. \r\nThe medium of anime is often populated with monsters, otherworldly creatures, special powers and overcomplicated plots (not that I'm complaining), where a lot happens fast. \r\nBarakamon is the opposite, true to its genre (slice of life) it follows a story where there ain't a lot of action nor progression in the plot, rather you follow the mundane life (yet highly entertaining) of Sei. \r\nI won't go into the plot details as I believe the synopses do a wonderful job of it but suffice to say that this is a gem of aseries. It resembles a wonderful and pure memory from a happier time in your life, like a high school field trip, or that fun weekend you spent with your parents as a child. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of character development, as you see the lives of both Sei and the islanders merging him into the community. The high jinks of child play and a lot of care and attention that could very well be a recounting of real-life events. As even if exaggerated for comedic porpuses the interactions come as organic and real. Oh and speaking of characters, and avoiding spilling any fun to be had, beware of Naru, as she will make you smile and laugh as you haven't in a long time. Especially as she represents the essence of a 7-year-old, and even if I'm repeating myself, she is portrayed in such a pure, joyous way, that you can't help but smile.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding both the cinematography, art style and sound design there isn't much to say, not that they are bad by any means but because they match the tone and spirit of the story to a T. Beautiful smooth animation, filled with comedic effects here and there that enhance the visual storytelling. Crisp naturalist sounds represent the simplicity of the Island lifestyle.\\n\\n\r\nOn a final note, the only thing I can say is that you deserve to watch this anime, to make yourself feel better in life because after all life is hard and we all deserve a breath of fresh air here and there.",

I liked the main character from the start.\r\nThe story is great for a slice of life and doesn't feel forced. The characters bring you along by themselves. There are moments when it is very obvious where the scene is headed but it surprises me at other times which has a nice balance to it.\r\nI didn't think much of the sound but when Idid notice, it was pleasant.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed it after giving it some time. If you want a quick slice of life anime to relax and laugh with I would recommend Barakamon.",

            "content": "The cliche of \"city slicker goes to a rural town, struggles as a fish out of water, before finally maturing to deal with their inner troubles\" has been done many times. In Barakamon we have a calligrapher who goes to a rural town in Japan to seek redemption and gain a new insight into his life and career. While the main plot goes the same way as you'd expect the cliche would, it is still a heartwarming gem that exceeds expectations.\r\nThe most interesting part of Barakamon is its cast. While many may focus on Naru, the loud and energetic child who is the main driverfor getting Handa out of his shell, the rest of the cast play their part. They are all interesting in their own way without falling into the hyper-exaggerated character tropes usually seen in anime. Hence, Barakamon creates a town full of fun personalities that you wish you could be a part of. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of tropes, the other main trope Barakamon avoids is having each episode focus on a specific character's problem, where Handa gets involved and solves the problem which helps him learn more about himself. Instead this show follows regular life in a country town. The largest obstacles the characters face are things like fixing a bath boiler. There is minimal drama here until the climax where Handa needs to face his demons.\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon is an anime with plenty of comedic moments, great characters and an entertaining, yet simple story. If you like a fun slice of life, watch this.",

            "content": "Stories about people chasing their dreams will always be popular because of how addictive and inspiring they are. Anime doesn't stand aside, presenting us a large variety of works telling about how important it is to have a dream of your life, how it gives you energy, how it makes you whole. From multiple sports animes to Bakuman to Uchuu Kyoudai, hell, to even Berserk at some point, there are literally tons of them, in any genre, you name it. \r\nAnd then there's Barakamon doing basically the same thing but with one subtle nuance which make it really stand out for me.\r\nSo, what's the storyabout? Seishuu Handa, our protagonist, is a calligrapher. Yes, it's a person who draws (writes?) hieroglyphs for a living, which sounds kinda odd for a westerner like me, but okay. One day, he participated in an exhibition (yes, they have those), where an elderly critic (and those too) saw his work and... didn't really like it, to say the least. Handa, having heard all that, lost his temper and punched the critic in the face. The problem is, in the artworld, you don't' punch critics in the faces, you just don't. Even if you really want to. Especially the elderly ones. But what's done is done, so Handa's professional future suddenly started looking very grim. His father, trying to somehow sort the situation out, decided to send Handa to a small distant island with a lonesome little village on it, so that he would lay low for a while and hope the dust eventually settles down. Handa isn't ecstatic about this, but realizes he can use it to his advantage, so he goes to the island with a single intent: be alone and work, work, work. But as it often happens, things go wrong pretty quickly. Or do they?..\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, it's that old story about how he meets a bunch of nice people, how he tries to avoid them but they eventually grow on him, how he becomes a part of this small village's community, blah-blah-blah, all that old stuff. I think, it's not correct to say that the story is not Barakamon's strong point, but rather that the story is not something it bets on. It doesn't have a complex story not because it cannot, but because it doesn't really need it to convey what it wants to convey.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a technical standpoint Barakamon surprisingly looks better... well, it may be a weird thing to say, but it looks better than it has to. I mean, come on, it's a simple little story, it's usually not expected to look more than just \"okay\". Nevertheless, it does: the artworks and the sound is actually really-really decent, and the opening holds a spot in my top-10 favourites. Not something breathtaking, but it's nice to see this much effort and soul put into a seemingly small work. And that diligence shows in everything, creating a very special atmosphere of tranquility and warmth.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, there are a lot of animes, and who knows how many other media, telling us how important it is to go after your dreams. Barakamon, on the other hand, adds a remark not said aloud by many: don't forget to live on the way. Try and find joy in simple things as well. Don't just mindlessly pursue your goal like a robot, instead make a stop once in a while to look around, raise your head and see the sky and stars above. Yes, the dream of your life is surely important, but your life has so much more to it. And that, I'd say, is a thought that deserves to be spoken far more often.",

And not in vain! \r\nNeedless anime easy enough story: a young calligrapher Handa could not contain their emotions at the criticism of his paintings and struck his master, for it was sent for re-education (looking for inspiration) to another island. Handa was driving with only one thought - to work and write. But the island has decided differently ... \r\nOf stale, freak only in pictures and your goal Handa began to turn into a man. And all thanks to a littlerestless girl Naru and her friends. I admit, at first I myself did not love her recklessness and importunity, but after a couple of episodes I was on her wave :) Collect beetles, climb mountains, fish, watch the sunset - at any time, just call me :) \\n\r\nAfter watching such anime know how important it is to live. Do not walk like a robot for the purpose, and to look around, just raise your eyes and see the stars. Blindly following the pre-planned purpose, we often forget to enjoy the little things - the smiles of friends, conversations with neighbors, privacy or unexpected party. We become too stiff and just awaken their child. As soon as you stop to think linearly and relax instantly find your style inspiration. \\n\r\nThis anime need to feel the feelings that arise when viewing, remember and keep in my heart.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. sorry, original text in russian was google translated because of amateur knowledge of english.

            "content": "There\u2019s a question I get posed with every once in a while when someone asks me about my anime preferences: \u201cWhy slice of life?\u201d This question stumps me for a bit; I get lost in my thoughts, try to form an explanation that sounds quasi-intelligent, and after a minute of awkward silence and blank stares, I come to a conclusion that gratifies my conscience, but leads to anger or confusion:\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\nBarakamon is an excellent example of why I adore the slice of life genre not only because it embodies the characteristics that make the genre so enjoyable and accessible to a wide audience, but itsimultaneously dissuades common, negative stereotypes with its simplicity in execution. \\n\\n\r\nHanda Seishuu is a bit of a unique personality. As a famous calligrapher whose progress in life has been closely monitored by those around him, it\u2019s pretty safe to say that all of the stress that surrounds him would be enough to bring any normal individual to his knees. Needless to say, Seishuu\u2019s no superhuman, so what is ultimately expected happens: he caves \u2013 big time. After KO punching a well-known calligraphy critic for scrutinizing his work as lifeless, Seishuu\u2019s friend, Kawafuji, and his father, Seimei, send him to a small island to collect his thoughts and chill the heck out.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, it sounds like the \u201cstory\u201d will carry out predictably and his path to redemption is all but guaranteed, as dictated by the storytelling gods. The beauty of Barakamon, though, is that is (almost) exactly what happens. However, if such a conclusion seems that inevitable, why does Barakamon still stand out not only when compared to other slice of life anime, but to other anime in general?\\n\\n\r\nWe begin the complicated path towards that answer with an innocent little creature, Kotoishi Naru, whose personality is indicative of both the atmosphere and direction of Barakamon\u2019s \u201cstory.\u201d In most slice-of-life narratives, little thought is given to a cohesive storyline; in fact, the nature of these series is character-driven. Thus, in order to create a strong slice of life anime, strong characters are necessary. Let\u2019s stop here for a second and discuss the following question: what does it mean to be a \u201cstrong\u201d character in slice of life? Must a character encounter and conquer conflict? Does she need to express her inner thoughts through philosophical introspection? Will these questions ever lead us to an answer?\\n\\n\r\nChances are they won\u2019t, but believe it or not, the answer is much simpler than the questions suggest. Taking a page out of Naru\u2019s book, it just has to be \u201cgobs of fun,\u201d and that is exactly what all of the characters in Barakamon, led by Naru, provide for the audience. Barakamon\u2019s cast embodies the very definition of character: expressive, diverse, human. Simple traits \u2013 Naru\u2019s bubbliness or Hiroshi\u2019s indifference \u2013 complement each other while building unique personas that help make the cast such a memorable one. However, for those who blindly characterize character depth solely through loose definitions of \u201cdevelopment\u201d, \u201cmaturity\u201d, or some cryptic hodgepodge of esoteric script-writing, Barakamon humbly fulfills this plate with an expected, yet coherent tale of Seishuu\u2019s path to what most people in their mid-twenties search for: a role in life. \\n\\n\r\nWith the unbounded potential of anime as a story-telling medium, typically what one would expect is a flashy and dramatic journey of self-realization that culminates with our glorious protagonist coming to peace with his past demons and becoming an entirely new person. \\n\\n\r\nBarakamon says to hell with that. \\n\\n\r\nInstead, the show leisurely builds Seishuu\u2019s character through a series of insignificant, comedic moments dashed with tidbits of wisdom. Nothing glorious here, but how Seishuu comes in terms with his past and his quarter-life crisis is beautiful in its grounding in reality. There is no defining moment, no moment of Nirvana, and no deliberate pacing. In fact, there are times where Seishuu \u201cdevelops\u201d as a person quickly, only to take two steps back. However, it is in this awkward, unpredictable growth where we see Barakamon\u2019s undeniable ability to tell a story so familiar and relatable, yet also send a message while entertaining with ease. \\n\\n\r\nAnd boy does it send a message. From catching beetles under the scorching summer sun to enjoying an archetypal seasonal festival, Barakamon effortlessly conveys to the audience its genuine philosophy of life as a thin veneer over the bulk of its content, which consists of everyday goings, short gags, and the occasional serious moment. It proceeds throughout its twelve entertaining episodes without changing its formula and holding true its aforementioned identity.\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon\u2019s character design and animation are both pretty standard for 2014. Unlike contemporary anime, there isn\u2019t too much overt sexualization, which is always a breath of fresh air. Backgrounds have a soft color palette making the visual experience more soothing. Music is a definite plus in Barakamon. From a strong opening and ending combination to a soundtrack that always seems to play the right track at the right time, the show satisfied all basic visual and audial desires.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhat does it mean to be yourself?\u201d This is the simple question Barakamon explores without needing to spell it out. Instead, with its vibrant cast and simple story structure, Barakamon is able to stand out from the crowd, and I believe it is perhaps one of the best, and definitely the most sincere anime I have had the pleasure to enjoy in 2014. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "BARAKAMON, the anime that restored my faith for anime after a hiatus of watching shit animes and severe mental defecation. Many thanks to my friend, Samual for recommending this anime to me after that previous disappointing piece of shit. Thank you for your kindness, your enduring understanding, and for being the wonderful SJW that you are. \r\nBefore I begin my review, I'd like to give a big shoutout to our boy Karl on getting D5 in league of legends as we look forward to welcoming him in P1 next season. Your hardwork and dedication is a true testament to your determination, and will live onin that border of yours for the next 400 days. \\n\\n\r\nNow onto the review.\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon taught me that an anime can be good, while being completely and utterly uneventful. Now, I know what you're thinking. 'But hey PressurizedTurd, how can an anime be both unsubstantial and good?' Well, I'm glad you asked cuz that's where you're wrong dear boy!!! When did I say Barakamon is unsubstantial? In fact I daresay Barakamon is filled with as much substance as the testosterone in my ball sack after listening to Flo Rida for it filled my soul with the essence of poetry. It was free flowing, rhythmic, with the occasional UMPH to give me that jump start to my emotions. I've been off the needle for a few years now and let me just preach to you fools that this anime revitalized me with that same rush without the STDs. Thank you Kinema Citrus for producing this poetic sensation and keeping me off the streets. \\n\\n\r\nThe greatness of this anime is comparable to that of Jane Eyre. Have you ever read Jane Eyre? That subtle gentleness of the morning breeze, describing a delicate blade of grass in 20 pages is something I cannot possibly forget in this lifetime or the next. Besides the obvious beauty of its descriptive description, it made me want to claw my eyes out because Jane Eyre was such a basic whore and LITERALLY described a blade of grass for 20 pages. But in Barakamon we have Naru, who came in like a wrecking ball at juuuuuust the right moments to prevent the narrative from plunging into a Ed Sheehan song. This is the decisive difference between this animated masterpiece and that literary shit they call Jane Eyre.\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon is an anime best seen in the confines of solidarity while thinking about life. It's definitely not like DxD or other 'bro' animes that you watch with your homies. Personally, I drank citrus black tea and sought answers to the many questions of life and to my surprise, it worked. What is life? What is light? Did Brett Kavanaugh rape Christine Ford? The answers came pouring in like a ray of hope, that same voice of reason that we saw in Interstellar. By watching Barakamon, I found the 5th element, that final puzzle piece to end my lifelong trek in seeking answers. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I get side tracked let me explain my review. Barakamon is a balanced anime where no one area overshines the other. Which is why my scores represent the same score x6. But as I've phrased previously, Barakamon was a great anime that provided me answers to life and its spiritual meanings. During a period when tinder was taking over my life, it taught me that all girls are sluts and through my love for Hina, I've received my calling to uninstall and wait till a real world Hina would come into my life. I have no doubt that this anime can help realize your calling as well. \\n\\n\r\nGoober gobble thank you Barakamon.",

            "content": "This will be my first review ever on this site. I know that this might be a bit amateur(-ish) but please bare with me and hopefully this can give you all new comers some insights into this anime.\r\nAfter all new waves of fantasy animes, blood, gore, flashy colors etc. I thought to myself.\r\n\"Well...I guess that's it. I think, I see everything\"\r\nI then laid back on my chair when I saw a picture of this anime. Its the picture of a man wearing all-blue walking with a kid beside him\r\n\"Great another slice of life anime...I will just give it a try\" Next thing I know, Ifinished the entire series and later on would finish the manga.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to compare this anime to a cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night. It made my heart grew 3 sizes as with the grinch during Christmas and help me to reignite my love for this genre once again.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10:\\n\r\nAgain the selling point of this anime is its pure slice of life style of story telling, Exploring the life of a Junon-boy(hehe) living life in a small town. The hook(some might agree with me) was at the last scene on episode 1. The scene hits home due to my personal experience as a city boy, who loves to go visit my grandparents once in awhile. The music to accompanies it made the scene more memorable and warmy feeling.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nI know I know I put 8 there. Yes the character have their difference in styles and over the art is great with fluid animation...with a little of rough here and there but hey its still very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\r\nIf you read my story part, you'll know that the music in this anime really compliment the scene. From the warm, fuzziness in the first episode to the random encounter of comedy that is sprinkling throughout the show. The music really gives you the feeling of \"small town\" vibes. And Oh My Glory the opening...the damn OPENING! I cant get this song out of my head(in a good way of course) and also a very warm and fuzzy ending is very appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\r\nAH yes this is gonna be fun. The character in this anime are full of colors and unique in their own ways. We have Handa-sensei; A quick temper, calligrapher as a main character he's...lets say...different and with time he develops from hard headed to slightly cool temper with a bit of heat in there. The supporting case are also interesting; Tamako with her secrets of being a fujoshi, Miwa's boyish character, Kawafuji with his comedy with Handa and my favorite character naru with her fun going personalities that really make me want to have her as my child((Police please don't arrest me))\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nHeck yes I enjoyed the show and hopefully the new comers will too. From start to finish you will never be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10:\\n\r\nAs I said from the beginning;Barakamon is like a Hot chocolate during Winter. it warms your heart, made you feel good about your life, made me remember my pass((personal)) and after this anime on, you'll feel refresh and encourage to go and dive again into the anime world. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review and hopefully you will love this show as much or even much more than I do.\\n\\n\r\nFresh26564-was here",

            "content": "Let me preface the review by saying I detest children in anime because they are either extremely obnoxious and/or they are designed and shown as overly cute to obviously manipulate the viewers emotions. I also hate tsundere characters because of how irritating and violent they are towards other characters turning them into crappy one note characters.\r\nBarakamon is perhaps one of the rarest shows that not only manages to circumvent it but makes a person like me, who hates annoying kids and tsunderes in anime, fall in love with the show.\r\nIt centers on protagonist Seishuu Handa, a 23 year old genius calligrapher who gets exiled tothe countryside due to an unfortunate incident. He has always been absorbed in his work and competitions to such a degree that his social life is 0 with him having only one friend. He is that handsome guy you wonder about why he doesn't have a relationship with anything other than his work. Now Handa is a tsundere but his portrayal goes beyond the typical violent cliche that plagues anime/manga nowadays. He's tsundere in all the right ways and this makes his reactions and expressions even more fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe deuteragonist of the show, Naru, a 7 year old tomboy is remarkable in herself because her character never manipulates the viewer into feeling any of the typical emotions related to one-note kids in anime. She helps Seishuu see a world beyond calligraphy and he creates a bond with her that alleviates her loneliness in a way even the villagers cannot.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is fun as well so in the interest on not spoiling anything, I'll just say enjoy them as and when Seishuu meets them. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is pure slice of life. Don't expect anything else from it - drama, romance, action etc are not there and the show is all the more better for it.\\n\\n\r\nI just want to tell everyone to watch this show now. It has hidden life lessons that don't get beaten over your head and you go on a memorable and very charming journey with the most unlikeliest pair of characters in a long, long time. \\n",

            "content": "I liked this show. It was a good comedy in it's own right, and had a little more serious undertone on it. This was bought together with a good setting and great characters. Let's get this review started. I should seeming as I started this like 4 months ago!\r\n*MINOR SPOILERS*\r\nWe follow the story of a Seishuu Handa, a calligraphy artist who was forced as a kid to practice calligraphy day and night until we come to present time, where the 20-ish Handa is trying to find his own style. He presents a piece of work to a Director of an Art Group who dissaproves. Handais naturally annoyed and assaults the director. He is punished by being banished to an island - an extreme version of \"go to your room\". Ensue the comedy. - Story, 7\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound - Again, as said in many of reviews, the art follows a very post-2000 style, clean and nice on the eyes but nothing special. What is nice is it's set on an island, presumably not far from Tokyo (where Handa grew up and where he submitted his art too the previously mentioned Art Group), in summertime, so got a very summer holidays feel to it, ironically like the island from animal crossing new leaf. On 3DS. You should play it. NOW. Only 29.99... Sorry, sound. Sound is nothing special, the music/OST anyway, BUT this is why I love anime comedy, the Japanese know how to use sound to amplify comedy. For example, Handa comes into a situation where he bolts upright because he's in a stressful situation, and as he bolts up the sound of a xylophone being like run down, can't think how to explain it, but yeah, it really makes it that more funnier. 7/7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - there's a good cast number, but I'll run down the main ones. I think I've covered Handa enough, he's nothing more than your average protagonist really, an artist just trying to find himself while having to deal with the distractions of middle school teens, people living in a rural, no-electric community, and 7 year-olds. Speaking of which,\\n\r\nNaru Kotoishi - This little girl is supposed to be the other protagonist I guess, the one who has the most interaction with Handa. I mean, I guess she's cute (I dunno imo, she's kinda.. Woah :P ) but I just found her annoying. I guess that's true to a 7 year old who's like massively hyper but still, who I would've preffered to take Naru's place...\\n\r\nHina Kubota - Naru's best friend. Now Hina is CUTE. She doesn't really perform much of a role other than just be part of the 7 year olds who are a distraction to Handa but my God, if me or my friends have kids, I pray to whatever being there is that, if the baby is a girl, she turns out like Hina, So goddamn cute.\\n\r\nMiwa Yamamura - One of the middles choolers, along with Tamako Arai. They're kinda like Naru, only less annoying because there, like, double her age or older. Nice little character interaction is when Handa helps them out with a calligraphy assignment, but I'll leave it to you how you judge these characters if you decide to pick this up. Personally, 8 (think the 8 is mainly for Hina haha).\\n\\n\r\nSo, overall, yeah, I'd say this is worth a watch, but I suppose I'd say pick up any anime comedy because there isn't really anything else that sets this apart from any other good quality comedy. I mainly picked this up because I saw this on a streaming website and my mind is instinctively drawn to anything that looks like Pokemon. One thing, and the thing I will end on, is the fact this anime, the deep thing I was talking about in the beginning, is the fact that you should draw inspiration from going out of your comfort zone (Handa is a shut-in to begin with) and this is shown through him doing a calligraphy drawing when looking up at the night sky. I liked that, drawing inspiration from being out your comfort zone and embracing our beautiful world. And with that, I leave a reccomendation of Sayonar Zetsubi Sensei (think that's right) and another reccomendation to take a walk outside now, or a visit to the subreddit earth porn. Either will do. (Show gets a good 7).\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Not recommended to people who prefer their anime plot-heavy and fantastical.\r\nRecommended to those who need a little pick-me-up and are fond or, at the very least, not averse to well-crafted, light-hearted slice of life stories.\r\nStory: 8\r\nBarakamon was definitely a pleasant wonder to behold. It has the subtlety and sincerity that the some of the flashier shows lack. While it might not have a rigid, overarching plot, the main character has enough internal, and external, motivation to move the story forward and serve as a central point from which we can view and watch the other characters interact. The episodes are simply made up of momentsin the village with the similar theme of helping the MC grow. Nothing feels forced or contrived, everything in the village has a low-key natural charm to it. \\n\\n\r\nThe scenes are made even more charming and distinctive by the cultural references and integrations. We learn a bit about not just the differences between country and city life--both in language and tradition--but calligraphy as well. I'm definitely no expert in the latter, but even I was able to appreciate the artistry it required.\\n\\n\r\nAnother notable thing about the anime is that many of it scenes usually have several interactions going on at any given time, which in my opinion is one of its strong suits. For example, while the MC and his friend are talking, the kids are usually running around in the background or trying to participate. Not only is it fun trying to take in and make sense of everything that's going on, this also lends an air of cohesion and authenticity to the scene. It portrays the chaos and random connections inherent in our usual everyday interactions.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise revolves around the seemingly warring conditions and expectations of youth and adulthood. It shows this through the MC's struggles to move past all the things he was taught to value as a kid that allowed him to excel in his field, and to enter the terrifying world of adults, where he is once again a beginner and must recreate and remaster himself. This disconnect is further reinforced by the introduction of his much younger rival who mirrors how the MC used to be. The tensions in the story aren't melodramatic or all that apparent. But that's precisely why the execution is so effective. It doesn't seem like a conflict that's imposed, it's one that naturally arises from the characters themselves and is exhibited in their actions and decisions. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 8\\n\r\nThere is nothing spectacular about the art, but its simplicity complements the laid-back and relaxing tone of the story. The sound, too, complements all the other elements. The songs are light and carefree, and the voices match the characters' personalities pretty well. Naru's in particular is energetic without being annoying and is equal parts childlike and comforting. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThe characters are well-constructed and often display characteristics that makes the bigger picture even more humorous and diverse. You have the village chief and his wife who regularly cook for the MC, the teacher who doesn't look like a teacher and always smokes, the adorably bratty children who have no trouble looking for insects to give to their friend for her birthday, the rival who both idolizes and tries to challenge the MC, the pseudo-gangster dad who sells liquor and values individuality, the teenage girl who dreams of writing manga and is unwillingly fascinated by male-male intimacy. They all bounce of off each other in ways that allow us to get to know them more through the situations they are in and the people around them. The kids refreshingly act like kids, with all the cut and dried honesty and innocent wisdom that characterize childhood, and the adults are convincingly complex, and confused, and learned in that way that time and experience teaches. \\n\\n\r\nThrough the MC's growth, we are able to see the ways these different people affect him and the many realizations they inspire. But the anime also shows that growth isn't a linear, black and white process. It involves progressing sometimes in sudden spurts, other times in small increments, and includes the occasional regressions. It's not about erasing the people we've been until that point or totally discounting our existence to replace it with a better version of us. It's about accepting that we change as we grow older, that life continuously expects us to grow and adapt the further along we get. It's about adding to who we already are, and learning from our consistently changing realities time and time again.\\n\\n\r\nThe highlight of the anime, I think, is the relationship between the MC and Naru, the precocious child who always seems to be around him and knows everyone in the village. There is something so refreshing and hopeful about the way these two fill the spaces and absences in each other's life. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Barakamon. It makes me believe in the exciting, renewing power of new friends and experiences. \\n",

            "content": "\"Staying in a city filled with noisy cars in the streets filled with people can be really frustrating and maybe you can't think straight and feel inspired. But hey, I have an idea, how 'bout you go to the Island filled with silence and joy and you'll going to meet so many people in a little town? There, you can get relaxed and comfy as they treat you as a very important person. But in return, you must give them back in return to their hospitality to you. And it might give you some lessons as you get back. How's that?\" - Me thinking wheneverI missed my province\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon is definitely an anime filled with happiness and laughter throughout the series. So here's my further review on this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story is very simplistic as it explains about a man from Tokyo who wants to win in a calligraphy contests wants to take a breathing in an Island after he did something unpleasant to the director of the contest after the director saying something offensive, for him, about his work and joining the contest in a losing effort. But even though it's simplistic due to it's genre as a Slice of life, I never get bored on how this anime delivers though. The anime is filled with lessons that you might learned from here, like Cooperation to both strangers or not and being friendly, and do something in return for those people that gave you something to please. Also, the pacing of the anime is great and the anime is very entertaining that it will keep you smile and laughing as you watch this anime. The pacing is great also from start to finish. I didn't see anything rushed. For the ending, I'd say it is also good as well. It really  did deserve this anime a well end. But, hopefully this is not the end though because I fell in love with this anime. Also, I was expecting a romance here due to some characters here in the series was asking about Handa's lovelife, but the story only flows in a Comedy and slice of life. Nothing else. Kind of disappointed though. But it still a great story without it nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Characters in the story, let me put it this way. let's just say you are a person from the city and the people from a small town in a province took notice of you. And they also know you, but in a good reputation. So, in order to give you a big warm welcome to the town that you've being visiting in, they give you something to eat and gave you a warm smile as you try to know them better. But in return, you must give cooperation as well so that they will treat you that you're one of them. So... that's how I describe these characters here in Barakamon. It's hard to explain them one-by-one though (and I'm not lazy) so I just explain this instead to avoid any spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nNow for minors, the art is truly remarkable though due to it's scenes, like the sunsets and the stars in the sky, and the artform of this anime is good. I thought it's from Kyoto Animation though... But for a second though, I just realize that it's not from them. But they have some similarities though, especially the scenery of the whole place where Handa, the protagonist, is currently visiting in, and the characters's artforms too... Reminds me of K-On! though.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the Sound, I'd say both OP and ED are sound remarkably entertaining. Also, this is the second time I'd heard NoisyCell for the ED of this anime. The first ED I've heard from them is on MadHouse's \"Death Parade\". And it is kind of emotional tone rather than the OP though. But both are great though, it's not that catchy for those who aren't love rock songs. But, it's great nonetheless. For the seryuus, at first, I thought it was Rie Kugimiya who voiced Naru because I noticed due to their accents. But as I took a little bit of research, surprisingly, it was voiced by a young girl (not woman). So, it's kind of cute to hear her voice and I would like to hear her again in the future. As for the other seiryuus, there' no doubt that there's no problem here to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I should say, this anime is a brilliant work, no doubt. I really should thank to my friend who shared this anime and I really love to watch this anime. No doubt, this anime should stay around the top 100, and even though it's not too long if there's something that needs to replaced, I'll just say that this anime, again, is brilliant. I've learned a lot of this anime, and it was a jolly good show indeed. A Jolly good show...",

            "content": "As years go by you realize that there are stories and things in general that are worth seeing, hearing, experiencing, etc. over and over again\u2026 not because we forgot their type, or we need it like we were deprived of some nutrient or something like that, they deserve to persevere because, well\u2026 they make us smile every time.\r\nThat\u2019s why a story of a \u201ccity boy\u201d in the countryside makes its way to comedy yet again\u2026 and into our very core I might add.\r\nBarakamon is\u2026 well described in the phrase you just read, up there see?  it\u2019s still visible, and there\u2019s really nothing more toadd plot wise, the story isn\u2019t new, neither are the characters, wacky smiley happy characters meant to bring a smile to your face with situations sometimes overreacted and occasionally exaggerated, filled with funny faces and many of the good ol\u2019 anime comedy staples.\\n\\n\r\nSo here\u2019s the twist\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist happens to be a calligraphy writer, one of the most unique things of Japanese culture, they just do that\u2026 writing, at least to us regular folk, but see to them there\u2019s a catch that lies in the nature of Japanese (and Chinese) character writing, an added value so personal, so culturally based, so full of layers that it might as well fall onto the category of \u201cthings people don\u2019t care\u201d\u2026 like art appraising, or philosophy (it's my major so I know something of people telling me \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d).\\n\\n\r\nIf I was to make an explanation about my take on calligraphy it would have to be that calligraphy in the Chinese way adds a layer of content to writing, since the symbols don\u2019t necessarily represent that which the common code might suggest, is like when we westerners write poetry, we except our code to hold an special meaning trough particular interpretations, but in the case of Chinese writing the characters are themselves home to representation, since the code indented in them is not as strict as ours (or as we like it to be).\\n\\n\r\nSo, it is kinda of a curious kind of glue to this whole series isn\u2019t it? I mean calligraphy appraising (or appreciation) it\u2019s something that probably goes beyond us regular anime viewers\u2026 so why is it there? \\n\\n\r\nThe contrast then isn\u2019t really between city and countryside, it\u2019s between the overwhelming weight of dedicating your life to such a complex thing as calligraphy against dedicating your life to the, due to a lack of a less worn out expression, the simple things. In the end the comedy is not barely physical or based on the bare contrast of lifestyles or life choices, but it lays its foundations in other difference, the one that lays between the shadow of the ghost of complex human understanding, the one that goes from the complexities of rationality and/or \u201ccommon sense\u201d such as trying to appraise calligraphy can be and beyond, and other so different kind of complexity\u2026 the complexity (or lack thereof) of happiness and simple human emotions\u2026 not that the physical setting has nothing to do with it, on the contrary, it\u2019s the perfect place for this context to develop.\\n\\n\r\nGood ol\u2019 fun\u2026\\n\\n\r\nYou may think it\u2019s not there, this such rich and complex contrast, but that\u2019s the magic of it, you live it, laugh at it, and enjoy it, even if you\u2019re not aware of it, see that\u2019s one of many of the great abilities of our human consciousness, working without us knowing, so sometime in the future up the long road of life you may look back to such moments and thoughts and realize the fulfilling greatness that they provided you, all while wearing the most innocent of disguises, or codes if you want to keep the nomenclature.\\n\r\nIn the end Barakamon is a beautifully achieved comedy, that unlike others, takes a little sweet time to activate your brain, just enough to not only give the overall series comedic content an awesome background but also make the whole journey such more worthwhile and fulfilling than a regular unassuming comedy.. Even if you do not care enough to realize it.\\n\\n\r\nOr maybe you can just laugh it out and get really happy whit it\u2026 because happiness is that kind of thing that we need to do over and over and over again, not because we need it\u2026 well you get the point.\\n",

Throughout his stay, he slowly got to know the villagers and he was able to learn a lot of things from them. \r\nIt doesn't have a complicated plot, the character development is not dramatic. There's no magic, epic battle scenes or romantic love story. Each episode does not have an intriguing mystery and there wasn't even a cliffhanger, but forsome reason, I had the urge to watch the next episode just so I can see Handa-sensei and the villagers live their everyday lives.\\n\\n\r\nIf I can describe Barakamon in one statement, it would be a \"really laid back and charming show\".\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Oh hi there, just know that i'm writing this while waiting for my flight to an island with beautiful scenery and life-changer villagers, because that's how much Barakamon affected me. (Sorry if this review is mehh, but i'm trying to avoid giving any spoilers.) \r\n\"You won't see any opportunities from below if you keep looking above your head all the time\"\r\n\"Once you carve your path, all that's left is to walk it.\"\r\nSometimes, life isn't always the way you want it to be, and that's what makes life worth living. Watching this series, i cannot stop thinking about the beautiful hidden messages that lie within everyepisode. Slice-of-life anime has always been my favorite, and Barakamon, you're gonna stay in my list for a long period of time big boy. \\n\\n\r\nPunching the calligraphy  director - being sent to an island by his father - coping with the different lifestyle than in Tokyo. Pretty much the whole summary of Barakamon. Simple right ? That simplicity is what makes the whole story so interesting to watch. When i watch any anime, i don't really like to finish all the episodes in one day because i feel that, the longer time it takes for me to finish a series, the more connection i feel with the characters, simply because i look forward to it. ( yes, even though there are just 12 episodes. i know i'm a little weird). \\n\\n\r\nHanda is a very lovable character. He feels so low about everything except when it comes to writing calligraphy that he felt the need to punch an old director for criticizing his work, (not very lovable now doesn't he), but he started to show his true bright color throughout the series especially after meeting Naru, Hina, Tamako, Miwa and Hiro, and you know what, i love this guy. Despite his serious looking face, he has deep thoughts about everything, wisdom quotes that he said to himself, leaving him utterly embarrassed after noticing that he was heard by Naru and others.\\n\\n\r\nThere are times when i just want to curl up in bed, in awe of everything that happened, and sometimes i laugh at the stupid jokes, not because i think they're funny, but because of how much i can relate to those. (They are funny actually) And nope, not a single tear was shed, but i do feel my heart fluttered with happiness and other kind of feels i cannot explain, i'm not too good with words, but have you ever felt happy over small little things and everything is just great, yeah, that kind of feels. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a feel good, heartwarming, inspiring anime, give it a try. \\n\\n\r\nI can't help but smile when watching the entire series. The OP and ED are so good i didn't skip any of them during those short but sweet 12 long episodes.\\n\r\nSeason 2 ? Yes please ! And there goes my informal review. \\n\\n\r\noops, they're already announcing my flight. Ja ne ! \\n",

            "content": "Barakamon is an anime series that shows you the daily lives of islanders in Japan where a city boy goes through a tough adventure. It's not your typical comedy anime, Barakamon is actually quite different compared to other anime comedies. It really shows you how big the diffrences are between cities and islands.\r\nStory: 7. The story isn't so exciting but it's not a big deal because it's the characters that really make the whole thing into a succes.\r\nArt: 10. Well, it's a modern and new anime made in 2014 so the art is very nice and \"fresh\", and by this I mean both the animationand the charactar/anime design.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8. It doesn't really contain much soundtracks and music, but I think it's good enough for only being a 12 episode long anime. The voice actors really did a great job making the anime sound realistic, with focus on the kids voices in the anime that actually are acted by kids around the same age. Compared to other \"anime kid characters\" it's usually adults acting them and it doesn't sound so good and realistic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10. The characters are the best thing in Barakamon. They are the sucess of the series making it into something unique. You'll see it yourself while watching it, I don't really want to \"spoil\" the best thing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9. Barakamon is enjoyable because of it's outstanding comedy and characters, that's all I can say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9. Barakamon is as I have written before a unique and different comedy series that is worthy of watching. The only reason I won't give it a 10 is just since the story isn't so exciting and could've been better I guess.. But it's no big deal as I mentioned before because the real focus is on the characters.\\n",

And Barakamon is just one of those rare treasures you'll find out there.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe story is simple, and not it's strong point I'll admit. But it's what they make out of the story that makes it so enjoyable. Every episode has at least one moment where you either laugh, smile, or blow out a little more air out of your nose than you normally do ;) The producers and directors did everything right (so far) with this anime. The story is simple at first, but later it actually doesseem to get a little deeper and devulges into the importance of friendship and togetherness.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9.5678/10\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely the strong point of the show. Every character is extremely likeable and very realistic. There's the otaku fujoshi girl, the tomboy, the energetic little girl, the shy little girl, the average achieving yet easygoing boy, and of course, your hardworking modern day city boy (or adult, whatever you wanna call Handa) Everything about the characters and their interactions just make the show 100% better. \\n\\n\r\nOST 8/10\\n\r\nAt first I didn't really think much of the music since I didn't fully grasp the story throughout the first half of the first episode. But I soon realized what it was really about. And once the first episode ended it made me feel just truly happy and warm. Not many anime shows do that for me, or anyone I'm guessing. Once the episode ended, the ending song totally complimented the entire atmosphere. If I had to pick the most memorable track, it would be the ending; Innocence by Noisycell. It's one of those few anime songs where you don't need the actual anime [footage] to enjoy. The opening is good too. I would say the OST is average overall though.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 9.678/10 \\n\r\nSince it is 2014, of course the animation is amazing. The animators really know how to set the happy, warm summer mood and you can tell every background is done with real care and hardwork put into it. It's actually quite stunning if you pay close attention and watch in HD.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Barakamon is a really enjoyable and heartwarming show. I'm a little bias towards this because I value the same qualities this show depicts; friendship &amp; togetherness. If you need a break from the serious animes or just wanna laugh and smile, this is definitely the anime for you.",

            "content": "*This review is based on the anime series, Barakamon.\r\nBarakamon/ \u3070\u3089\u304b\u3082\u3093 , 12 episodes a 20 minutes, aired from July to September 2014 ; Comedy, Slife of Life ; licensed by FUNimation\r\nBarakamon isnt your generic anime. This show may be considered something simple, non special - but thats exactly what makes it awesome. There are no battles, no magic, no harems, no romance - this is pure Slice of Life, and its awesome.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story is something very unique. How many shows have you seen which center about calligraphy? None, of course. Barakamon tells the story of Handa, a young calligrapher who spends his days ona rural island, preparing for an upcoming exhibition. He meets new people, friends and situations and grows thanks to them. Well executed and every new episode feels new and fresh, and adds unforced and natural comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nEven for a relatively modern show, Barakamon's art style is more than impressive. Facial expressions and movements are done exquisitely, the calligraphy and some scenes are just perfect. Couldn't give anything else than a 10 here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe OP is very fitting, adds to the show's atmosphere. Non generic and something fresh, I've listened to the whole thing every episode. ED isnt as great but still good. Voices are very fitting and manage to show the difference of the islands accent and speaking style, even for a person who doesnt speak japanese. Background music is good too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nOne of the key points where this shows excels. There isnt a single character who isn't unique and likeable. There arent the known dere-character styles, every single person is special and grows through the episodes, especially the MC. The comedy is also great and in synchro with the personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThis show is very calm and plain. It has great comedy and shows the becoming of a real adult and the struggles of hard workers. Every episodes feels fresh and brings something new, be it storywise, comedywise or characterwise. Very enjoyable. I personally wouldn't have minded if there were a bit more romance or another main female lead in the story, but the show's still fine as it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nA great show. If you mainly watch harems, shounens and action-SOL like, me this will be a great refreshment and change from all those. You will get unique comedy and very loveable characters packed into an interesting story. What do we want more?\\n\\n\r\nI recommend watching the miniseries before every episodes, its really funny!\\n\\n\r\n*As always, thanks for reading! If you have any ideas on how I can improve my reviews, feel free to tell me! I'd love to hear some feedback.",

            "content": "Seish\u016b Handa is a twenty three year old male who is a pro calligrapher. After reacting badly to criticism of his work he retreats to Got\u014d Island on his father\u2019s demands in order to help himself grow as a calligrapher and as a person. Along the way he interacts with various people allowing him discover his true self and look at life in a more calming manor.\r\nIts funny when you look at anichart's line up and see that show that you know will be great. When I first came across Barakamon I automatically knew that I would love this show and I wasn\u2019t disappointed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon is an anime released in the summer of 2014. The anime was directed by Masaki Tachibana who did work on two shows that I\u2019ve yet to watch \u2018Ghost in the shell\u2019 and \u2018Noir\u2019 and the show was written by Pierre Sugiura who is pretty much unknown. Both of who had the task or creating this show which may have made the job easier by using source material from the manga. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story is about building Seish\u016b\u2019s character and making him see life in a more relaxed manor. There is no overlaying story as it\u2019s more focussed on character development and the relationships between main and side characters. The majority of the time it feels like a vacation and soon it feels like home. Seish\u016b\u2019s relationship with Naru is the main point of the series as Naru brings out the fun and maternal instincts in him which would have been hard to believe from episode one. To sum up the story is simply a sweet tale about development as an individual and becoming better then Seish\u016b thought he could ever be. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nSeishu is our main protagonist and pro calligrapher. He is a very uptight man who can\u2019t except criticism of his work and is very childish when it comes to loosing in calligraphy contests. From the get go he appeared to be a very boring individual. After he moves to Got\u014d Island he realizes how poor the living conditions are in comparison to technologically advanced Tokyo. He finds it hard to adjust at first and being persistently bothered by our secondary main six year old Naru doesn\u2019t help. By the end of episode one he eventually understands the criticism given to him of his work and that\u2019s when he begins to develop himself as a calligraphist and as an adult. The time he spends on the island helps him to realize that there is more to life than just his work and although he values calligraphy dearly he learns that time away from work and time with people who make you happy can have a positive impact on his life. \\n\\n\r\nNaru is our second main character. She is a bubbly an energetic six year-old that enjoys spending time with others and loves doing strange activities like catching bugs. Naru brings out the maternal side in Seishu which is very sweet. The two had a rocky relationship at first but they eventually developed a strong friendship. Naru is also more intelligent and more grown up than she appears at times but still retains her childish attributes. As for the rest of the cast they are very strong and each gets a relative amount of screen time. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe artwork is very good the characters have there own individual designs. (Though Naru does have the big Moe eyes) The animation is very solid done by studio Kinema Citrus who are relatively unknown and haven\u2019t done much. Black bullet is one other of there works that I\u2019ve watched. The scenery in the anime is beautiful, such as the sunsets that Seishu gazes at. \t\t\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe music score was done by Kenji Kawai who is notable for his work in Death note, Ghost in the shell and Higurashi. It has a very soothing and childish sound which matches the tone of the series. The opening SUPER BEAVER performed by Rashisa was excellent and the ending theme Innocence by Noisycell was spectacular and was the song of the summer for me and may be song of the year potentially.\\n\\n\r\nNegatives: \\n\r\nThere\u2019s few and far between problems with this show. I think the only problem this show is that despite its nice and calming nature, not many people will get into this series. This could mainly because most of the people I hang around who like anime want action, demons and or harems and would not take interest in beautiful shows like Barakamon. Shows like Usagi drop are a good example of nice and calming shows that won\u2019t be as popular as others mainly because it doesn\u2019t have any hard hitting action or storyline and this saddens me. Other than that the comedy can be hit or miss but it doesn\u2019t take away from the overall score of the show. \\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\r\nBarakamon is a very sweet and beautifully done anime that I definitely hold dear in my heart. It may not be an astounding anime but its well worth the watch. Anyone expecting action packed demon/harems should stay clear and those looking for more beautiful and peaceful things to watch then give this a try. Overall 7.8 out of 10 \\n\\n\r\nSimilar anime to watch are the aforementioned Usagi drop. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading guys, Have a nice day!  \\n",

            "content": "Barakamon was considered one of the best animes of 2014. Well i really can\u00b4t tell you much about cause i just watched some animes back from 2014 but at least for me, i think it deserves that title. \r\nI did not find bad points here, but that doesn\u00b4t mean it is perfect. I would consider this anime good but nothing more than that. Why do i say such thing? Well i will explain it on each topic. \r\nStory: (6/10).  The story is not bad. But it is not original nor creative. In fact, this story is something that probably you already saw in movies,tv shows or even in other animes. On my case, i'm tired of it. The city guy who is angry with life so he goes living in some rural city and learns the value of friendship and all that kind of stuff .. meh over explored. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough we do have some nice moral lessons that's why i gave it 6/10. For a slice life it's a good show and tell us important things. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen i started watching this show, i expected something completely new. I was expecting some nice deep relation between Kanda and Naru(our main characters). While Handa is a 23 years old calligrapher who was mad with his own life after getting a bad grade from the director of an exposition, Naru is a 6 years old girl who just stared her life and is still innocent to all kind of dificulties that life can bring. \\n\\n\r\nBut ... meh they blowed it up. I think they had something great there, they could had gone much more deep into Handa feelings and making them contrast with Naru's feelings but.. as i said they just did the usual. We see him adapting to the town and nothing else besides that. This does not mean that they failed, it just could be better. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10): The landscape, the sunshine, the calligraphy that Handa does.. everything looks excepcional. The characters also look great, and the design fits perfectly with their personality. Especially Naru, it just looks so nice. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (7/10): The soundtrack looks nice, but it isn\u00b4t nothing that we will remember in a near future. The opening is cool but the rest is just normal. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (7/10): Well they are nice, they look nice, BUT THEY ARE NOT ORIGINAL. We don\u00b4t have anything new ! And we just see development in Handa .. the rest has a really weak development. Well for 12 episodes long we couldn\u00b4t expect more .. but still i can\u00b4t give it a good rate because of it. All the characters were copied from other films or whatever .. Nothing new at all. I was having a deja'vu while i was watching this. Again, this doesn\u00b4t mean that they are bad, but they aren\u00b4t good either to deserve a better rate. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10). Well Well finally we got here. I think even though not being excepcional, this anime excels pretty well in terms of entertainment. The comedy is good, the enviroment is awesome(I actually felt or at least imagined how it would be like if i was in the same position as Handa.) We can feel the peace of the town and all the good feelings that we can take out of there. Plus having in each episode, important lessons that can help us in our daily lives is actually pretty interesting.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is good but we can\u00b4t deny that it has nothing new to show. Although i advise you all to watch it because it is a nice show and really can entertains us well. But don\u00b4t expect something deep out of here. In fact this anime does not have any deep moment, it didn\u00b4t reached my heart in anyway, i mean there is just comedy and slice life. No drama, no romance, nothing related to it exists here. So if you are looking for something like that, don\u00b4t try this one.",

            "content": "Japanese calligraphy is occupied by several young geniuses, masters and newcomers. Among them all, seishu Handa, a rising star of this closed world. He collects excellent prices and recognitions. So he has all, he is young, beautiful and talented. His problem? His arrogance and confidence. One day, when a gallery director criticize his work, Handa get excited and hit him violently in the face. The young man is forced to go into exile on a small island at the bottom of the deep Japanese countryside. This penance would have been for him a sort of spiritual retreat in order to give new artistic momentum. Whileit is a regular in the town and cities, he landed in a place more quiet, deserted. It will be invaded by kids, and therefore will not even work quietly, relax a while. The neighbors arrive unexpectedly, his house is considered as a playground ... Impossible to work.\\n\r\nIn super rhythmic episodes we will discover new characters and what Seishu Handa will do to accomplish his aims and create his identity in calligraphy.\\n\\n\r\nMy thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThe bet is successful here, especially the design: the characters are beautiful and the scenery too, everything is colourful and gives an atmosphere of constant good humour.\\n\\n\r\non the other hand, the atmosphere can also have very dark moments during the sensei depressions. The dynamism of the anime is a strong point and the funny parts too. Naru has a very important role in the comedy of this anime because it is the driving force, almost the main character. Naru is a little girl of 7 years, it is still in the paws of the sensei with his friends in the area. It is early, eager to see them leave, then befriends with them and discovers the joys of country life. He, who has lived for calligraphy, discovers the outside world and relationships with people. He becomes indebted to the generosity of people and gladly accepts to render services to the people always with a touch of humour because the situations and Handa\u2019s reactions are often inappropriate. So we have here a very valuable life lesson without being judgmental. The serious side is also well highlighted, including Sensei\u2019s introspection about his behaviour, his life and his artistic future. The range of character is important and each person is someone who really gives a unique charm to this story.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the ancestral art which is calligraphy is brought here from very light manner but we understand that practitioners have a real philosophy of life. Through anime/manga, it always manages to discover something from Japanese folklore, here is calligraphy but this very original way of presenting things is exceptional and barakamon is a crush for me!",

            "content": "\"It's best when there's nothing special.\"\r\nThat one line perfectly describes the entire series. Even if this show were just the first episode as an OVA, I wouldn't have hesitated to give it a 10. In fact, I added Barakamon to my all-time favorite anime list after the second episode. Somehow my gut was telling me that I would not be disappointed until the end. Unless you count the show ending as a disappointment in itself.\r\nAs in: \"There are no more episodes ;_;\", NOT \"Wow, the ending sucked.\"\r\nStory: 10;\r\nThe next sentence will sound very cheesy, so maybe grab some nachos. There is no story to speakof, because the story is life itself. The story can be summed up as \"the struggle is real, but worth it in the end.\" From the synopsis, you wouldn't think you could relate to a \"young, handsome, talented, narcissistic young man.\" Especially something as out-of-the-ordinary to a Westerner as a calligrapher of all things. I was half expecting Sei to be fairly unlikable and unrelatable as a character.\\n\\n\r\nBut really, you could be ANYONE and still find ways to relate to Sei's struggle as he finds his muse. This isn't just about an artist heading away from the loud city to find his inspiration in the countryside. It's about maturing as a person and learning to look around once in a while - you might find friends from all walks of life.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9;\\n\r\nThe art wasn't anything outstanding, but everything was exactly as it should be. Character reactions were always funny when they were supposed to, and conveyed the proper melancholy all the same. What I really loved was the representation of rural Japan, especially in a few \"inspiring\" scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10;\\n\r\nThe OP is catchy and the lyrics describe the show very well; didn't care much for the ED.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, listening to the soundtrack while doing *anything* will give you the impression of flying in a hot-air balloon while wearing a particularly colorful party hat. And there is a parade of small forest animals all wearing very small party hats beneath you as you fly over them. (See \"Kodomo no Kanchigai\" and \"Kodomo to no Kouryuu\" from the OST to understand what I'm talking about.)\\n\\n\r\nBut then... the wind blows your party hat away and you feel strangely melancholic, and then nostalgic for a place you have never visited but is somehow present inside your soul.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was spot-on for all of the characters (especially the main duo played by Daisuke Ono and Suzuko Hara). Finally, a child character played by an actual (talented) child instead of a grown woman with an annoying and squeaky voice!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9;\\n\r\nI'll be honest, aside from three or four characters, not all of them were memorable or anything. It was a shame, but some felt very underused. In fact, I even hated one of them. Even though I understand his role in the story was to give the main character some self-reflection material. He was plain annoying, and I can't stand his voice actor in anything but one role. Funnily enough, he tends to shut up in that role most of the time :^)\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, they shouldn't all be memorable. That's how life is. Think back to the most memorable days in your life, in any setting (not necessarily happy). Do you remember everyone in the room, outside, or wherever it was? Or even half of them? Unless those days were spent with just one or two people at all times, that's unlikely.\\n\\n\r\nPeople are somehow just there at the right time to create the scene, and years after they fade away from memory.\\n\\n\r\n\u1d2c\u02e1\u02e2\u1d52 \u1d31\u1d50\u1da6 \u1d47\u1d49\u02e2\u1d57 \u1d50\u1d52\u1d50\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10;\\n\r\nThere would be moments where I couldn't get through 10 seconds of the episode without pausing to catch my breath. Some episodes would have me laughing my ass off in the first 20 seconds. Still, comedy is not the only thing Barakamon is good at.\\n\\n\r\nI laughed, I cried, I laughed while crying, I cried while laughing. There was one scene towards the end where my mind was so conflicted about whether to do one or the other, I ended up doing neither. It was like seeing an old  friend across the street, trying to yell their name, but as you open your mouth you hilariously choke on your words like in a slapstick comedy.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, making me go through such a range of emotions in quickfire succession is the mark of a good show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10;\\n\r\nIf you haven't guessed already, I really liked the show. So much so that this will probably be my first and only review on this website. Don't get me wrong, I've had shows I loved just as much, if not more than Barakamon. I've had moments where I'd thought about reviewing Berserk 1997 (since I watched it 2 times in a row in the span of a week), or Welcome to the NHK. But even then I couldn't find enough words (or care enough) to properly convey my feelings towards them.\\n\\n\r\nThis show made me giggle like a little kid again. It made me wonder why I hadn't done so in a while too. After episode 11, I almost didn't want to watch the finale.\\n\\n\r\nThen the show would never end.\\n\\n\r\n\u02b3\u1da6\u1d4d\u02b0\u1d57\u02c0",

It had a very simple plot line, great characters, and events that made you laugh your head off throughout.\r\nThough not much is going on, something is always going on and episodes 1-12 never let you get bored. With the most overdramatic characters and moments, it is a great show to watch for all ages.\r\nNot to mention, my favourite character Naru is just the cutest person ever.\r\nPlot 10/10 \u2013 As said before, it is a very simple plot line. The main character is banished to a remote islandto find inspiration on how to be a better calligraphy artist after he disrespected his boss. This  does centre around calligraphy, but doesn\u2019t focus the entire show on that one thing; instead, it focuses on the main\u2019s characters development and the people on the island itself.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10 \u2013 The art was very pleasing to look at, but wasn\u2019t too overwhelming. It had great lighting and colours that mixed well together, and I overall enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10 \u2013 The characters were very simple, but we got to know a majority of them over the course of the 12 episodes. The main character and one of the side characters were specifically focused on, and we were able to see how they each transformed into different, yet better people and how their relationship got closer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10 \u2013 This was a really fun anime to watch that didn\u2019t have any complexity to it. The characters were fun to watch and even though not many events happened, it was entertaining. I\u2019d recommend this anime to people of all ages and to anyone who just wants a relaxing, fun anime to watch.\\n\\n",

Anyhow, I loved the simplicity of it all. The anime was so natural; far from clich\u00e9. Very realistic - it was like animating someone's life. And the moments - the moments were so perfectly placed. \r\nImagine this: you, on your early-twenties, surrounded by the beauty of nature; in an island with kids, not in your range of age, doing simple \"islander\" activities like fishing, swimming in the beach one hot afternoon, enjoying a festival, etc. If youliked the thought of these, I would recommend you to watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for everything.

Hmmm... well if I had to compare this anime to something, I would say it feels like eating a really nice meal with your close friends and family.  After you eat the meal, everyone is satisfied and the next day you wish you could repeat the experience all over again.    \r\nCharacters: 10 / 10 - The shows greatest strength!!!\r\nThe main character, Seishu Handa, is a quirky adult in search of his \"own\" style of calligraphy.  His absolute focus on calligraphy and how it shapes his decisions and interactions with thepeople around him creates a very entertaining and fun story.  I love that he isn't some cliche highschooler who makes cringy and idiotic life choices.  In short, he is awesome!    \\n\\n\r\nAs fun of a character as Seishu is, Naru really completes the dynamic of the show.  Her innocent, adventure, fun-loving personality is really fun to watch when she interacts with Seishu.  They are an absolute joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also no annoying side characters!!! YES!!!  How often does that happen???\\n\\n\r\nMusic, artwork, plot: 7 / 10 \\n\\n\r\nAll done well and feel natural.  None of it really stands out, but for this show that's okay.   \\n\\n\r\nAtmosphere: 10 / 10 - Second greatest strength!!!\\n\\n\r\nMy oh my!  This show delivers every episode on a satisfying, comfy experience.  It is an extremely wholesome anime that just gives you that sigh of contentment.  The interaction between Seishu, Naru, and the villagers is executed perfectly.  \\n\\n\r\nRecommendation:  WATCH!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nIt's not that this anime does something that you haven't already seen before, but that it does everything well.  If you want to watch something that will help you relax, have some laughs, and feel happy then this is the perfect anime for you.  This is definitely one of my favorites.      \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes you want to slow down from your shonen butt clenching, flahsback having, annoying voiced, thick action fun and have some feel good moments. At that i would have to say is the best phrase to sum up Barakamon.  Good feeling fun.\r\nThe intro alone let me know just how much i was going to enjoy nearly all of the characters and relationships. (namely the one between our protagonist Sei and Naru) Personally i have a warm place in my heart for shows that teach a little bit of how to find yourself with the help of people you wouldnt expect. If you dont carefor slice of life-ish shows you might want to avoid it i guess, but then again it does follow an actual story with emotional tension to it, so it bridges the gap a little bit. The only character i didnt really like was the newbe artist who is introduced halfway through the show. He is helpful for showing an immature view that our hero might have had when he was a younger and aspiring artist. Still he just came of as annoying and lousy to have around most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nAll be it a fantastic show you could argue that at points it can be slow or feel like not much is happening. Its not that i felt this to much but i can see where it might drag at a few points. I understand what Barakamon is about so i never had a pacing issue myself.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub was very enjoyable for those who prefer it that way. Robert McCollum, (the boi) who is probably most notable as Kougami from the Psycho-pass series, uses his smooth man voice to deliver a fantastic performance for our hero. Giving the lead a voice that commands a little respect made him a much more enjoyable character than if he had the voice of a typical light novel boy voice, and for the use of Robert McCollum i give the dubbing team a tip of the hat.\\n\\n\r\nNaru may be one of the cutest characters in anime that I've ever come across, and in the best ways i find her to be a great representation of the child in not only Sei, but in whomever is watching the show as well. Naru was never used for anything thing other than feeling like a realistic 7 year old girl, and for that i am very grateful. It hurts my heart sometimes to see innocent characters used for some creeps fansevice shitfuck purposes. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all i can't think of a bad time to be had watching this show. Even if its not your genre of choice you would still probably enjoy this. The art and characters are beautiful coupled with a nice story on learning to mature and grow as a person it will make you feel good all the way baby.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts: I didn't mention the Calligraphy for some reason. It's like important but in the same respect it could be swapped out with a different passion and work just as well. Great fresh idea though, and that's the shit i like to see.",

            "content": "A big reason why I made this review is because I didn't quite understand why this anime was so highly rated, I didn't slog through this anime hating every minute of it but I didn't walk away feeling like this was 9 or 10 material. This is in the Slice-of-Life category and while yes this does have the atmosphere of a Slice-of-Life story I can't help but feel as if this anime is really overrated.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nI don't have that much to say over the story other than the way it wrapped up was absolutely fantastic, the last episode really hit me in the heart inthe best way possible. The acceptance and belief in the MC's choices made me very happy.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9-10\\n\r\nThe character designs and lineart was fantastic, I really loved the atmosphere and colors. If you're into eye-candy exclusively you're really gonna dig this anime a lot. \\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nIt was what you should expect, I didn't really enjoy the opening song as much as I thought I would but it isn't like the OST of this anime is a bunch of \"deets and doots\" like Umaru.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10\\n\r\nThis is where this anime lost me, while Naru and the kid cast are really fun I can't help but feel like something was really missing. While Naru was the neighborhood scamp I never really got the feeling like she was a kid, I felt as if she was just a witty companion and they never go deep into her character.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention I didn't connect with any of the characters and feel any deep attachment. They were all very shallow and there wasn't a deep dive into any of the characters. Then again I understand that this show is 12 episodes long but apart from Naru and Hiroshi I felt like everyone else was just taking up screentime.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I won't be too harsh because this anime is all about making friends.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the comedy in this show alot, and I didn't \"slog\" through this anime like I've done with other series that were highly rated yet very boring. \\n\\n\r\nOverall -- 6\\n\r\nIf you want to bool out and slice of life this is definitely the show to do it with. \\n\\n\r\n(I rate like Fantano btw.)",

            "content": "It is rare indeed when I find a slice of life show I actually want to watch, let alone one that I consider one of my favorite shows. But Barakamon is different from many of those shows. Like many slice of life shows, it is character driven and focuses on everyday events instead of action and adventure. For the most part, I find these shows to be boring and unengaging, but Barakamon pulls you in through the top notch characters and underlying story. Truly a wonderful experience. \r\nThe story is fairly simple, yet also very engaging. Handa-sensei exiles himself to an island after disgracing himselfat a calligraphy exhibition. His arrival to the island coincides with the start of summer and he finds himself constantly bothered by the neighbors children as he tries to reinvent his calligraphy style. Episode one covers his arrival to the island and his introduction to many of the nearby residents, including Naru. Many of the following episodes follow Handa's exploits on the island and many of his experiences start to shape his new calligraphy style. The audience is treated to a look into what country living is like in Japan, which is a nice reprieve from the constant Tokyo setting in many other anime. City boy Handa is often out of his element on the island and around his neighbors, but he ends up experiencing many things on the island that he didn't in Tokyo, including summer festivals, the ocean, and Bon festival. Through it all, Naru is a fixture is his life on the island and many of the other kids are impressed by the \"Sensei\" and follow him/force him to participate in their summer adventures.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, however, are what make this anime amazing. Many of the supporting cast are hilarious and its fun to watch Handa try and navigate his way through their large personalities.  Most of them are largely defined by certain personality traits and none of them really change throughout the course of the story. And they shouldn't, because they are there to help Handa change, to help him see there is more to life than calligraphy or grand prizes. \\n\\n\r\nHanda and Naru's relationship is one of the centerpieces of this anime. Naru is interested in this new person and wants to play with him; Handa gets dragged along. At first, he is annoyed with her, he tells her to get out of his house, to stop bothering him. She is persistent, and she slowly worms her way in. She worries about him when he has to be hospitalized and he in turn worries about her at the beach. He wonders about her parents and what happened to them, on her birthday he's scared of disappointing her with a mediocre present. She becomes one of his best friends on the island, no matter how hard he tried at the beginning to make her go away. She helps him change as a person without realizing it, and she gives him inspiration in his calligraphy. In the end, even though he knows staying in Tokyo would be more practical, he chooses to go back to the island for Naru, and for everyone else. \\n\\n\r\nHanda's character change is also important. If he had stayed the same disgruntled, entitled city boy, this wouldn't have been an enjoyable anime. The contrast between his first drive to the village in episode one and his second drive in episode twelve comes to mind. In both, Naru's grandfather drives him from the airport to the village. In episode one, he is unimpressed by the view of the ocean. \"It's just the ocean,\" he says. Whats so special about it. When confronted with the same view in the last episode he looks out and says, \"It's gorgeous.\" Another example is his reaction to his results from the exhibitions he enters throughout the series. When he gets second place early on in the series, he is convinced that he is getting no where with his style. When he gets fifth place at the end of the series, he accepts it because he was proud of the work that he submitted. Seeing Handa struggle with reinventing himself throughout the series is an enjoyable watch, and it is through his friendship Naru and with everyone else that he is inspired to change and to grow and to write beautiful calligraphy. \\n\\n\r\nThis is certainly the best slice of life anime I have ever seen. Most of the time I got lost in the episodes and when it was over i was honestly surprised it had been twenty minutes. The opening and ending are spectacular as well and the art is good, but I have seen better. All in all, this is a solid 10/10, I have no complaints. Truly perfect. \\n\\n\r\n(Scores: Story 10/10, Art 8/10, Sound 9/10, Character 10/10, Enjoyment 10/10)",

            "content": "Barakamon, that anime from 2014 that got largely ignored in favor of flashier, more popular series that aired the same year. However, Barakamon truly holds its own. Even though it isn't anything brilliant or truly thought provoking, it is a ray of joy that will always lift you up on your worst days.\r\nStory 7\r\nThe story is simple and solid but is not the main focus of the anime. Essentially, a famous calligrapher has a melt down and decides to travel to a rural island to find inspiration for his work. Most of the series focuses on his interactions with people who live on this island.Overall very simple story, but it works.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSolid art. Nothing amazing but everything looks nice enough, especially on the island.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nIsland sound is captured very well. Silence is used at just the right times. The opening and ending themes are both solid and capture the lighthearted and joyful nature of the anime\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe main character is interesting enough, clearly struggling with social interactions and anxiety about his work. He develops quite nicely throughout the series. However, Naru, one of the little girls who lives on the island, completely steals the spotlight. Not only is she hilarious, but she also reminds us of the joyful and carefree nature of childhood that we so easily forget once we grow up. Truly an awesome character. Most of the side characters fall into a cliche but they are quirky and or funny enough to keep the viewer entertained.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed the series. It would always light up my day and help me get through tough times. Just the right amount of cute, funny, and motivational to cheer up anyone!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n",

            "content": "Yeah, with Barakamon, I don't think my heart has ever felt so full.\r\nThere's nothing that's ever worked better as a plot device than redemption and finding your roots again. With Barakamon we get just that. \r\nHanda's fall from grace was great to watch. It was a scenario many people of his age, myself included, can sympathize with. The idea that older people decide if we succeed or not and don't even understand is always frustrating, I know I got that struggle on a daily basis. \r\nAs Handa tries to find his roots during his exile, the story of Barakamon truly comes to life. The ruralvillage is the perfect setting not only for him to perfect his craft but to humble himself and become someone worth cheering for. The major elements of the plot are quite predictable as a whole. The meddling kids who don't know how to stay away, Handa's growing love for the place that has seemed so annoying to him, his departure, his return, his rise after his fall from grace with his own identity in the calligraphy world intact, it isn't anything new, but it still works. The story still packs a punch and really hits you where it hurts. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are likable and you come to love them as they become a huge part of Handa's growth. Naru Kotoishi has to be one of the cutest kids in anime to hold such a big art in it. I believe this dynamic is one that is almost foolproof and is growing in popularity. The big brother little sister dynamics works wonders. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is great all around. It's warm, bright, welcoming. It shed light on the world of calligraphy that I had no idea about and really add in highlighting some of the genius and madness that comes from the art form. \\n\\n\r\nAt just 12 episodes, the story comes and goes like the breeze and at the end you are left fulfilled and full of love and hope, if you're into that sort of thing. Barakamon is worth the watch, full of joy and happiness with hints of sadness, all of it in proper proportions. You won't regret watching this one.",

Thanks to the art and the story, this anime made me realize that anime isn't all about action, superpowers, horror and nudity. A good anime can also just be slice of life and comedy all together. The anime shows us the life of the villagers on a small island far from the big cities. After watching this, I really wanna travel to Japan and travel through the country side. I highly recommend this anime for those who lovescomedy and slice of life.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This is my first review.\r\nBarakamon is the first full blown slice of life I watched. (I had previously seen Devil is a Part-Timer, but because of its action I don't consider it fully slice of life.)\r\nStory (7): The story was mostly episodic, with an interesting overarching storyline. I found all of the episodes to be interesting and the overarching plot engaging.\r\nArt (8): The art was appealing and got the job done. It didn't need to do anything all that fancy, though I found the calligraphy in the show beautiful and looked forward to every piece that was created.\r\nSound (8): Nothing stood out in particular,though I found that the soundtrack fit perfectly with the show and its characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9): This is where the show shines. I found all the characters interesting and unique. Naru, in particular, was very endearing and cute.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8): I definitely enjoyed this anime. Though I was a bit hesitant at first, it quickly brought me in with its heartwarming story and interesting characters. I found myself eager to watch the next episode and finished the entire 12-episode show in two days. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8): Barakamon is a very good anime. Though I'm usually an action shonen junkie, Barakamon was a great change of pace, and has opened me up to an entirely unfamiliar but exciting world of slice of life. I highly recommend this anime to everyone, especially those looking for a jumping off point for slice of life. \\n",

(Can\u2019t find the proper word to describe that thing) What\u2019s with the flowery background and the kid\u2019s smug face? I shouldn\u2019t watch this anime. Why is this anime even placed at #89?\u201d But in the end, I gave it a shot due to its rank. I never had been so wrong in my entire anime-related life.\r\nOkay, this anime started of like \u201cI\u2019m pissed off for not winning the prize. Better punch the judge\u201d \u201cbanish him in the lands~\u201d andthen \u201cA kid is in my house\u201d and woah! And the best part of the anime starts here XD\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, Barakamon perfectly defines Slice-of-life. No explicit scene, no romance and the important part, no fanservice. This anime gives off a cozy feeling and a good vibe which makes our mind at eases. I mean, this is just plain perfect! The environment, the characters, the plots, the OSTs and the jokes. No antagonist = no problem xD I was actually laughing while watching this anime xD I don\u2019t know why but, while watching this anime, it gave me an adrenaline rush which I haven\u2019t experienced for a long time since Kuroko no Basket~\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis Anime is quite heartwarming. The way, how people treated him, how they interact, the jokes, the hardships, and all, I mean, it\u2019s amazing! Words are not enough to explain how magnificently marvelous this Anime is. It also teaches us not to give up (which is approximately clich\u00e9d to every Anime xD) yeah, inspiration. We need inspiration and motivation to move on or to do better in the things we are doing. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI was literally thinking about \u201cI wish to transfer/to live in an island like that\u201d while watching the series xD but, it\u2019s impossible. The people in my country are way too different compared to them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I really love this Anime. This Anime needs more love, more viewers, (I guess, this Anime can be watched by any age) and last but not the least, needs a SECOND SEASON. I wish, this Anime would continue making episodes until forever. However, forever doesn\u2019t exist so, it\u2019s impossible for that to happen in real life XD\\n",

Seishuu, the main character,  is completely out of his element on the island where he has moved, and his interaction with the people of the island as he clumsily and foolishly tries to adapt to their way of life is hilarious and innocent. \r\nNaru, the small girl who befriends Seishuu, is a character that you won't easily forget. She's tiny and adorable and her desire to alwaysplay and have fun awakens the child in every viewer. \\n\r\nI will admit this,   Barakamon seemed to go on for a long time, at least it did for me. It took me awhile to finish this anime. It can be a little slow and there were times that I forgot that there was an actual story. But when I finished Barakamon, I was satisfied.\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys slice-of-life, comedy, or to someone looking for something sweet and cute.",

Look at the current titles getting rave reviews: Amaama to Inuzuma, Non-Non Biyori, and Udon no Kuni no Kiniro Kemari (Currently airing as of 10/2016).  This one is no different than those and I would argue better.\r\nSei Handa (the townsfolk call him \"Sensei\"), is a gifted calligrapher that seems to have lost his way mentally. He punches a renowned critic and is sent by his father to a remote island to \"find himself\". Over 12 episodes his adventures with the townspeople and his self-discovery lead him to becomea better person and finds that his real home is not in Tokyo but on the island.\\n\\n\r\nKotoishi Naru, the young girl our protagonist befriends has to be one of the cutest anime characters in recent memory even a bit mysterious as we find that she is being raised by her very busy grandfather so she ends up becoming the town \"scamp\", being raised by the village as a whole, she has taken a liking to Sei, and even misses him when he's gone. She is also filterless and with that helps Sei overcome some of his eccentricities. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is very light, very cute and very very enjoyable.

The show deals with themes of reclusion and stress juxtaposed with rural community and inspiration through nature. \r\nFollowing our somewhat burned out protagonist we as viewers experience the feeling of entering this new and very different environment alongside him. First the confusion and rejection, but thenalso opening up to it as time goes on, until you realize that you have already welcomed the quirky folk of the island into your heart. \\n\r\nIf these may seem like very flowery expressions: This is the best way to describe your emotions watching this series as it intentionally creates moods and emotions rather than actual plots, just like other healing anime. \\n\\n\r\nAt some times the shenenigans of the kids in this show might be annoying to you and depending on your tolerance for hyperactive children this will affect you more or less strongly.",

I'm not a \"Slice of Life\" fan. Not at all. And that's because slice of life often builds up to some kind of romance to keep the audience thrilled on to something. And jesus christ, japanese romance is the most cringeworthy shit on this planet. Barakamonis different. This Anime doesn't need romance to keep you watching. It delivers with wholesomeness. \\n\\n\r\nSeishuu Handa, the protagonist, flies to an island, meets friends and gets to know what living life really means. That's the whole story. No complications. No romance bullshit. But this Anime doesn't need a great story. It just needs simple joy with help of an 6 year old girl, that knows more about having fun then any other character. So if you're looking for something thrilling, something with excellent and thought out storytelling , go watch something different then this. But if you want to have an innocent show with great art [9] and characters [9], sit your ass down and watch Barakamon.\\n\\n",

This being my first review, I wanted it to be about Barakamon. \r\nIt is a 12 episode anime and about 20 minutes ish long. So it's not a long anime and doesn't have an amazing, action packed plot/story line. But I felt so connected to the characters and the relationship they develop over the 12 episodes. \r\nTo be honest, at first, the story summary/synopsis was a bit meh. It seemed kind of boring and I wasvery hesitant to watch it and waste like a day. But with no other choice, and there was no other anime that really interested me. I took a deep breathe and jumped into the unknown. And boy was I glad. I went through this anime like popping chocolates while crying on Valentines day. \\n\\n\r\nI laughed, I cried and my heart felt all fuzzy. I have the lines all memorised and fall asleep listening to Ono Daisuke's voice (he voices Handa Seishuu). This is really a great anime and I regret not watching this earlier. \\n\\n\r\nThis is such a heartwarming anime that could warm the coldest hearts. AND the opening and ending songs are ammmmazzing. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "*might contain spoilers*\r\nA child\u2019s smile is brighter than any light in this world. Its warmth will leach into your heart and refuse to get out, glowing eternally in your soul. \r\nIt will hold you tightly and never, ever, ever let go.\r\nThis is what I have learnt from the \u2013 totally being subjective \u2013 best slice-of-life anime series. \r\n\u201cBarakamon\u201d is a bittersweet (sweet with underlying tones of bitterness, I\u2019d say in a dramatic manner) anime series surrounding Handa Seishuu, a young calligrapher, who ends up being exiled to an island for punching another famous calligrapher. \r\nGetting out of the city and into the rural area, anotherlife dawns on him as he learns to embrace the simplicity of life by meeting Naru, a tomboyish young girl who has a peculiar love for bugs, Hiroshi, whose parents who might have been founders of Handa Seishuu no Fanclub, and other people who contributed subtly to the person he slowly develops into.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters: 10/10]\\n\\n\r\nOne word to describe the character development: brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nSince the first episode, we can clearly see that the creators of the series actually put effort into building multi-colored layers of personalities on the characters instead of just shoving them stereotypical -dere types. \\n\\n\r\nIf Handa is a seemingly stoic person, Naru is a naturally cheerful girl with a radiant smile, or Tama, an I\u2019m-totally-not-a-fujoshi fujoshi and her best friend, Miwa, a boyish and cool big sister\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, one thing that I particularly love about the anime series\u2019 character development is that it allows us to slowly peel off the outward impression that the characters give to us and actually dig deeply into their genuine personalities \u2013 either Handa\u2019s burning desire to find his identity, or Naru\u2019s feelings of loneliness behind that smile\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nThe creators have successfully hit our hearts in that way, asserting how we should never judge a person just by the things they try to display and their true nature lies in things they try to hide.\\n\\n\r\nJust by seeing how much Handa has changed since coming onto the island, we can all put on a smile and book our ticket there. \\n\\n\r\n[Story: 9/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe story will make you literally fall off your chair because of too much laughter. Its jokes are relatable and hilarious \u2013 I bruised my forehead lots of times because of bashing my head against the desk from too much laughter, and so will you. \\n\r\nThese light-hearted jokes are, in fact, one of the reasons I consider this the best slice-of-life anime series ever. The other, of course, is how it makes you cry without you realizing it.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of blatantly jerking tears from her eyes like some other slice-of-life anime series, \u201cBarakamon\u201d has these undertones of touching elements, waiting to be explored. One of the episodes especially gives us an insightful look behind Naru\u2019s plastered innocent grin \u2013 that carefully enclosed loneliness that she tries to pen inside her heart and show to no one.\\n\\n\r\nAnother fact that made me tear up is that the person who realizes it is Handa.\\n\r\nHanda, Handa, Handa. Such a seemingly hot-headed, brash, stoic character\u2026 \\n\\n\r\n\u2026and that moment when he mused \u201cMaybe she is lonely after all\u201d\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u2026I cried internally and stared speechlessly at the screen\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u2026just because of the sadness that sentence projected into my heart.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cBarakamon\u201d is not a show purely for comedy. Sure, it has lots of it, but you can never disregard the depth of this series\u2019 subtlety.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 10/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was, literally and figuratively, heaven to my ears.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is light-hearted, just like Naru herself. Not only that, \u201cRashisa\u201d by Super Beaver actually explores Handa\u2019s character very skillfully as the song talks about being yourself \u2013 by far one of the wisest OP choices I have ever stumbled across.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is a gentle song that elaborates the beautiful bond between Handa and Naru, and the appreciation he has towards her. \u201cInnocence\u201d by NoisyCell depicts just how tight she holds onto his hand, onto his mind, onto his heart and refuses to let go, determined to keep that mutual glow inside their hearts. A wondrous ED choice, I dare say.\\n\\n\r\nThen, finally, something I am particularly pleased with is the OST of the anime series. \u201cToki no Nagare\u201d by Kenji Kawai pulls heartstrings. Together with the context of the anime, it sends us across a passage of depths that the anime series subtly hints. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are amazing. Daisuke Ono, of course, pulls his role off flawlessly as always - his voice is simply perfection. The anime series seems to have hired child voice actors as well, which makes the roles even more real\u2026 and I mean, you should definitely check out the \u201cBarakamon\u201d seiyuu video. Naru\u2019s seiyuu is the perfect symbol of adorableness. \\n\\n\r\n[Art: 9/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe art is painfully beautiful. Enough said.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 10/10]\\n\\n\r\nOh yes, I enjoyed it very, very, very much. This is one of the most memorable anime series that stayed in my mind for a long time since I finished watching it, and I will never forget the feelings it managed to make me display. Just\u2026 absolute masterpiece. Wow.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 10/10]\\n\\n\r\nThis is the highest score I have ever given to an anime series. I love it and would recommend it to everyone around the world if I could. \\n\\n\r\nIt is literally, and I mean it, 12 episodes of beauty.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cOnce you carve your path, all that\u2019s left is to walk it.\u201d \u2013 Hiroshi Kido\\n",

I was watch Handa-kun and after hearing about its predecessor i felt like i was missing something great. Handa-kun was okay in my opinion not horrid but this is on another level. \r\nBarakamon is one of the best slice of life animes i have ever seen and really has a captivating interesting story. The music is good for setting moodsand the art is way better than the newer show Handa-Kun. (not really spoiler because you will see in like beginning of first episode)The art really fits this slice of life and really brings out the love and happiness that the small village has and how close everyone is. The art is really easy on the eyes and makes you feel relaxed and happy. It is not off the charts but it is beautiful. \\n\\n\r\n The characters are so unique and not only the main character ever single character is something else they are developed well and don't fail to support Handa all the way through. Handa made me cry a few times i wont lie he is such an amazing character and he would be an awesome person in real life. You feel very close to Handa and the emotions that character have for each other come out clearer than day. Even characters who are introduced for short while become quiet likeable and you can understand who they are and what they are to Handa and they are not forgotten easily.\\n\r\nA good example is the Handa's mom who is important to Handa and explains her position and how much she cares about him. She also is very understanding, yet  stubborn and unable to have her son change from just a loving kid. \\n\\n\r\nBesides that this show is just awesome it is not just an anime you watched because you have free time its an anime you want to give attention too and skip your summer homework and use your work time you planned for your self to stay up and do your homework but you spent it all watching Barakamon because you cant control yourself, because it makes  you fall in love with it once you start. \\n\\n\r\nSorry for the personal bit but if wanna watch a good slice of life and want to lighten the mood watch this.

I was obsessed with Sailor Moon like story lines and even got into the gorey side of anime.  Then Natsu entered my life (the main child character) and I find myself still looking for the next Barakamon.  \r\nBarakamon has the right amount of drama, comedy and \"romance\" a showneeds.  The characters are all intriguing and inspire you to just be yourself; love what you do and make no excuses.  The small town in Barakamon along with the animation made me reconsider \"city living.\"  After each episode I longed for a simple village with a close knit community.  \\n\r\nIf you're not into slice of life anime, this show will completely change you.  If you are looking for a slice of life show, none rival Barakamon.  Just watch it and you'll see why I can't stop watching it!",

The story was okay, but I think that the characters were one of the best parts about this show.  My personal favorite was Naru, who was not only cute, but had the most fun personality (her facial expressions were honestly the best thing ever). My friend who almost never watches anime, watchedthis with me and could not stop laughing and wanting to watch more.  I think that in itself says a lot about this anime and how anyone can find enjoyment and laughter from it.  I highly recommend checking it out, you won't regret it!",

There was very little action throughout the story so if you're the one who is into heavy fight scenes, this anime is not that type.  However, I would highly recommend this anime ifyou're looking for the type of anime that simply brings you on a low action, peaceful story line full of well developed children.",

Handa's back story is so unique and sets the anime up for great success. The bond between Handa and Naru is such a great bond they work together perfectly and with all of the supporting characters involved it has so many great aspects this anime is a must watch from its plot and it's character development you are sure to really enjoy every episode to it's core. Barakamon will not give you a huge climax but it sure does give youa warm feeling in your heart, the kindness of the villagers and the island itself is so heart warming and Handa's development from being so impulsive to being a very wise man. Meanwhile Naru is painted as a very goofy kid this may be true but once you dive deeper into her story your realize how important Handa is to Naru.",

            "content": "\"Barakamon\" is a sweet slice-of-life comedy about a young professional calligrapher who, upon retreating to a remote island to develop his style, meets the friendly neighborhood children. Although the characters are charming enough, I found the humor of the series to be weak. It was predictable and, at times, forced. Thus I would recommend watching its oft-compared work Usagi Drop instead. If you've seen that already, then give Barakamon a try!\r\nStory [6/10]: As a rule of thumb, it's best not to expect too much plot from a slice-of-life anime, and Barakamon is no different in that regard. What it offers is completely expected, but sweetnonetheless. Unfortunately, the show uses much of the same imagery and tropes as most anime: beaches, fireworks, and festivals. Most of the plot devices are trivial occurrences.\\n\\n\r\nPacing [5/10]: Following a very rushed first episode, the anime slows down to a crawl and not much happens until near the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt [7/10]: Aside from a few artistic risks, Barakamon does not really stray from the standard style. The animation is clean and crisp.\\n\\n\r\nSound [6/10]: The music was forgettable (so much that I remember none of it). The island dialect is pretty odd to listen to, but adds to the backwards charm of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [6/10]: While the main character Handa initially comes off as the typical standoffish genius that indigenous to anime high schools, he quickly loses this composure. He displays a refreshing variety of traits, including klutziness and fervor for his art, which are sometimes inconsistent but mostly seem to work. Through the series, he loosens up and his relationships develop, but the other characters don't get such close treatment by a long shot. Even the little girl Naru barely receives any character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [6/10]: As a whole, I liked Barakamon well enough and would've enjoyed it much more if I'd found their comedy to be humorous. It does not rank as a must-see, but is a light and heartwarming time filler!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: [6.5/10]",

When I first saw this series, it was a few gifs or screenshots of the hilarious face Naru makes when she demonstrates her knowledge of kana and starts reading a milk carton. \r\nShort review: Other reviewers have talked plenty about the charm of the series, the humor, the plot, but I'd also like to note that I think this is one of the few anime that really captures the essence of childhood.I can imagine myself as a child behaving and saying many of the things Naru and the other children on the island say/do, including butt-poking, catching bugs and teasing adults about it, and thoughtlessly slapping handprints all over a new boat. What I think makes this series truly great is that it captures the humor and youth of children in a way that other anime series have not - and that is what makes it memorable and worth watching.",

The story follows Seishu Handa , a calligrapher who moves to the remote Got\u014d Islands off the western coast of Ky\u016bsh\u016b, and his various interactions with the people of the island. IT'S A COMEDY.\r\nSo, what should i expect from a comedy?\r\nLaughs, and a simple but consistent argument. \r\nOk, so, tell Mr. Reviewer. What about the characters?\r\nWell, there are no more than 5 or 6 recurrent characters, they're all funny in different ways aswe are used to (at least, if you use to watch comedy animes). I call it, \"little town comedy\". A \"big city guy\" moves to a small island. You can imagine. After watching one or two episodes, they start making the spectator feel part of the little island. Will Seishu Handa get use to live with these peculiar people? That's the funny part. The characters will definitely make you love the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo... the music? And the art?\\n\\n\r\nThe music complement decently the scenes. And the art is good enough. What we're gonna remember is the laughs, not the music or the art. But, yes, is good :) \\n\\n\r\nDespite that the characters are simply amazing, and considering it's a comedy that meets the expectations, i can say it's an 8/10. I have to be fair. I recommend this anime to all who wants to laugh and laugh :) \\n\\n\r\nI hope you find my review usefull.\\n\\n",

            "content": "**Some Spoilers in the review**\r\nI very rarely write reviews. I was compelled to write after successfully finishing what probably is my first ever Slice of life anime. If there are any burdens, worries or concerns you are carrying in your life, probably from your work/ school/relationships and are looking for a feel good show that is guaranteed to give you temporary relief and probably reevaluate your life, this is the show for you.\r\n            This anime is about a calligrapher who is a sensitive individual and has finished 2nd and is ina state of depression, self hate and shame. He is sent off to an island by his family and business associate to recover and take some time off. The episodes are all pretty much about the protagonists' experience with the people and the beauty of that island, how it helps him in rejuvenating his mood. It all sounds like a simple narrative, but it was masterfully executed with loads of lighthearted comedy and precious moments of transcendence. \\n\\n\r\n           What I loved the most about this anime was how relatable the protagonist was to me and any grown up in general and how we can learn some things from this anime. We have a lot of  things we worry about in life and if we think hard about it, most of these concerns (aside health of our loved ones) are materialistic. Goddamn, our priorities are often so backward. This anime has a subtle message to the viewers that life and world are too beautiful to be moping around or worried. \\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist by the end does not achieve the professional success he hopes to achieve at the beginning of the series. But he transforms into a person that is complacent with that result and is more about doing work he personally can appreciate. I am sorry if you weren't wanting to read this part. But watch the anime, his profession is only an accessory to the plot. The story is more about his experiences and maturing into a complacent individual with better priorities. \\n\\n\r\nTwo of the best anime I have ever seen are Space Brothers and Barakamon. I wish they made more anime like these where adults and youngsters have some life lessons in there. If you know some more of that sort, please recommend.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.: I don't really grade art, sound and what ever other elements are usually listed out and graded separately by pros. This is 2014 ffs, almost every anime has watchable art compared to 20 years back.",

            "content": "Barakamon tells the story of a calligrapher in stagnation. After an... uneventful encounter with an art appraiser, he leaves Tokyo and goes to a small village in a remote island. There, he makes friendships and finds inspiration for his art.\r\nThe anime is cheerful and light. It is what you are looking for if you want quality non-violent, non-complicated, non-dramatic entertainment. Which is getting rarer to find nowadays, so it is a breath of fresh air. While the anime did achieve its goals very well, the genre makes it difficult for it to become THE legendary anime everyone is hyped about and will remember after watching.\r\nStory(this section might contain spoilers):\\n\r\nThe initial premise of the anime is solid. I would say the anime kept with it well. Of course, there isn't much happening story wise. We get to follow the day to day little things that make the calligrapher evolve and mature as a person and artist. Not having much to tell in a story is ok as long as it allows for the anime to flow, which happens with Barakamon. However, it can not be considered something out of this world. In the end, it is a simple story, a good one, but still.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is spot on. It is the best I could hope for an anime of this kind. The style fits the story and characters well, making a great ambience overall. However, I can't give it a 10 because anime is first and foremost, animation. Other animes display a higher level of animation with intricate battles and special effects, which Barakamon can not display. Which is ok, it just means it is not the best animation if the anime industry.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI liked both the opening and ending. The sound worked well with the art and achieved the chill and light ambience for the anime. However, it is nothing earth shattering either.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nCharacter development was the main focus of this anime.  And overall, it did a good job. The evolution of the main character is well presented and credible. As such, the main goal of the anime is achieved. However, some secondary characters seemed pretty basic and unpolished to me, even after being there pretty much the whole time. But that's ok, after all, they are secondary characters. No characters seemed particularly charismatic/memorable to me.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nBarakamon is one of these animes that make you wish you could just drop everything and enjoy life with energetic children around dragging you here and there. And because it made me wish so, I would say the anime was successful and made me enjoy the show. I liked it. But again, it is not something exceptional. \\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nBarakamon started with a good premise, and stayed loyal to it to the end. It has a very simplistic nature achieved with good art and music. Because of said simplicity, some characters remained perhaps unexplored. But perhaps this is one of the reasons why the anime has a  simple, light feel to it.\\n\r\nOverall, Barakamon achieves its goal. That is, to be a happy and cheerful experience, but not something particularly memorable. It is a good anime.\\n\r\n7/10",

But the most notable is an hyper little girl named Kotoishi Naru. And just like me, Handa doesn't expect what magic does Naru have in her pocket.\r\nAnd then the opening starts. Epic, fucking catchy, unskippable performance by Super Beaver. The opening video supports it in every way possible.\r\nThe journeybegins.\\n\r\nI'm a big fan of Comedy, but Slice of Life tag? Not really. So i don't expect so much from the series.\\n\\n\r\nHow does it feel to get your expectations exceeded, again?\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon is way too funny.\\n\r\nCity boy in 'alien' place with all his awkwardness of situations, unexpected experience of a strict-raised, not to mention his Narcissism and immaturity. Along with ecstatic 7yo girl  with her squad that's not losing in terms of annoying. Plus village teens and their youth spirit combined with crazy personalities. In addition, the rest of villagers is just as lunatic.\\n\r\nThe character department never lacks. The main character's development is depicted so well. And Naru, well, you'll know why i love this cute trouble machine so fucking much. The other characters is also very much entertaining.\\n\r\nSlice of Life anime needs to emphasize the character. And Barakamon do just that.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves in slow pace, but nevermind boring. You won't. Unexpected situations, awkwardness in the midst of beautiful nature scenery, surprising words coming from children's mouth, amazing etc.\\n\r\nAnd the feels amount this anime gives is bountiful. So you can laugh your ass off while feeling little memory pain in heart. \"Ahh, so this is what it feels like to be kids again\". You can't help but falling in love with this.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is of 2014. Pretty works. And the scenery feels like painting. Stunning. Not the strongest subject, but still worthy to be amazed.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA is not an all-star parade. You can feel Daisuke Ono award's aura here. But the totality of the cast is something different. And they use ACTUAL KIDS to voice over the kids. I can't really imagine the situations in the studio, haha. The voice of Naru,Suzuko Hara, is so cute. Did i tell you the ending song is just as awesome? 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a very definiton of Expect the 'what you don't expect from a series' Unexpected and a powerful blockbuster.\\n\\n\r\nCracking, full of feels, refreshing, exquisite, pure work of Maestro. Barakamon is worth every minute spent. One of the best work in anime of 2014.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Naru is Love, Naru is Life.",

            "content": "Any show that starts of with a guy punching an old man is gold in my book. It\u2019s got humor, a somewhat unique take on the city boy in the country idea, and some really feel-good moments. Let\u2019s get started!\r\nStory:\r\nSo the story starts off with Seishuu Handa, who after having his calligraphy insulted by that old man you saw earlier, he punches him. To avoid the public after such a scandal, his father suggests that he go on a leave of absence to the country and work on his calligraphy from there. Here he meets tons of people, who welcome him with open arms andwho he gradually becomes close friends with. Something to be noted is that the show doesn\u2019t ignore his punching the Director, and it brings it back up in actually a pretty series and realistically handled light.\\n\\n\r\nI think what I love most about this show is the sense of community. Every character feels very real and necessary, and you really get a true sense of friendship and kinship of these people. For instance, in the first episode Seishuu needs to unpack his things, but he has a lot of stuff. Without even being asked, the entire neighborhood shows up to help, and to them it\u2019s completely normal. In these few stills that come after that, I get more a sense of friendship than most shows can give you in a whole season, and this show is packed with moments like that.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story itself goes, it\u2019s pretty basic. A city boy going to the country to find himself is by far no new concept, and it\u2019s been done to death in films in particular, one thing I liked about this show was the use of Calligraphy. You rarely see it mentioned, at least in North America, and it really showed me a whole world of art. The animation and art of the calligraphy itself looks legitimately beautiful, which is great because it wouldn\u2019t be any good if the calligraphy that\u2019s supposed to be done by a master looks \u2018average\u2019. Another note is not something the show exactly did, but what it didn\u2019t do. They left out all of the \u201coh I\u2019m a city boy in the country everything\u2019s confusing\u201d for the most part. While it\u2019s still present, it certainly isn\u2019t a main factor in the plot, and Seishuu does a fair job of adjusting to the country life pretty quickly.\\n\\n\r\nStill, my main complaint I\u2019d say is that while it succeeds in using this plot to be pleasant, it\u2019s not nearly as ambitious as it could\u2019ve been, and seems content with being just \u2018great\u2019, rather than being \u2018amazing\u2019. There are a fair amount of times that the comedy just completely flops, and you\u2019re left wondering what exactly was supposed to be funny. The humor itself is pretty standard, and usually doesn\u2019t try to do anything unique from a comedic standpoint, which resulted in some episodes I found to be a little boring, especially when you can tell it\u2019s trying really hard to make you laugh. But when it relaxes and just let\u2019s the humor play second fiddle, it can actually be pretty funny. In this case I\u2019ll compare it to my favorite Slice of Life, Usagi Drop. Usagi Drop often does not try to be funny, and even the humor that is there usually isn\u2019t laugh out loud but still feels natural, pleasant, and fitting. This show has times when it feels like some of the humor is there because \u201cit had to be\u201d, rather than feeling natural like it should. Most of this out of place humor usually is present during the first 5 to 10 minutes of the episode, and then fades out and is replaced by more natural humor and a lot more of the feel good, touching moments that this show is loaded with. If you\u2019re not smiling by the end of an episode, there must be something wrong with you. From start to finish very enjoyable, and an extremely satisfying ending to boot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI find Characters generally to be the sole most important factor in a show. Characters can hold up poor animation, even a shoddy plot, but with bad characters, you\u2019re not going to want to watch the show, even if the plot is good. Like I mentioned earlier, these characters are amazingly good. Every one, even the side characters, feels unique, necessary, and great. From the wise yet amusing elders, to the bursting-with-energy little kids, they\u2019re all very love-able.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked Seishuu\u2019s progression over the series. He starts off as a impulsive pessimistic workaholic, but after becoming a part of this community he begins to see how much more there is to life, and from this he gains inspiration for his work. He has a really nice dynamic with the people around him, and you can\u2019t not love his interactions with the kids.\\n\\n\r\nI found Naru and Hina and all the children to be delightful characters in their own light as well. Properly done kids is such a hard thing to find, with the last one I saw being Usagi Drop. But when child characters are done right, it really works. There\u2019s so much you can appreciate about a child-like view of things, how everything is so simple and obvious, and the world is so full of wonder and mystery. Naru really is the perfect compliment to Handa\u2019s character. Hina at first I thought would be one of the really weak characters. It starts of with her seeming to be a gimmick-based character, with the gimmick being that she\u2019s shy and quick to tears, but the show quickly developed her out of this, and while she doesn\u2019t do a whole lot throughout the run, Hina was just a very cute and fun little girl throughout.\\n\\n\r\nI also liked seeing these characters that look up to Handa, Hiroshi, who is inspired to work harder after seeing Seishuu\u2019s hard work, and Kousuke, who idolized him and is a up-and-coming calligrapher as well. Both were interesting in their own way, and I particularly liked how through their interactions with Handa, both discovered something about themselves and Handa as well. We get the idea that Kousuke is a lot like Handa was before coming to the island, and this provides a nice contrast between how Handa has developed and grown as a character.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there are some weaker characters, Tamako and Miwa in particular. These characters came off as a little annoying, almost mean-spirited at times, and often-times their disrespect towards Seishuu could get pretty tiresome. With the kids it\u2019s not so bad, they\u2019re kids, they\u2019ll do these things, and at least they\u2019re cute while they do it, but these are middle school students, they really don\u2019t have a good excuse to be acting the way they do. For instance, in one scene it\u2019s shown that Miwa has made copies of Seishuu\u2019s house key and has given them to everyone, and in another scene they try to peek on him when he\u2019s in the bath, and turn the heat up on it to scalding hot. I don\u2019t find that funny, it\u2019s just mean and being a jerk. Along with this there was the second dynamic of Tamako being obsessed with manga, and the whole lame misunderstanding that comes from when she sees Seishuu and Hiroshi \u2018hugging\u2019. It didn\u2019t stay funny for very long, and her character had about as much depth as a kiddie pool.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good. I can\u2019t really go into much more depth than that. It\u2019s not exactly exceptional, being neither incredibly smooth, or breathtakingly beautiful, but it\u2019s not bad either. It has a pleasant look to it, with some wonderfully painted backgrounds bringing life to the country. However, you can clearly see the animation is not super smooth, and there is a fair amount of still shots without any animation at all. That said, I do have to give credit to the actual calligraphy as I said before, because the animation and design of it looks really good. The character designs as well are nice, though I did at first look think Naru was a boy, but I don\u2019t think that was entirely unintended.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThis show sounds nice. Both the Opening and Ending songs are really good and very pleasantly fit the mood of the show, and generally the OST was fine, though it didn\u2019t really stand out to me. Occasionally the background music can stand out a little too much and be kind of unfitting. Though it wasn\u2019t super preventable and generally wasn\u2019t to this extent, a good example would be one scene in episode 11 that really failed. The music starts off with a somewhat dramatic tone, but the song doesn\u2019t end. It just keeps going. They have a few jokes, but the humor bombs due to the unfitting music. When it finally changes, it changes to an overly sappy song that was only a minor improvement and still unfitting. After this the episode was fine, but it was still a strange issue.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a really satisfying and pleasant show. While it suffered from some issues with humor, it succeeded in having a great sense of community which a lot of shows lack, and it never failed to leave me without a smile on my face. It\u2019s an incredibly satisfying and enjoyable show, and I definitely think it\u2019s worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\n(Originally Written October 9th, 2014)\\n\\n\r\nhttps://writtenandwriting.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "Simple.\r\nIf there is a word that neatly sums up this series, \"simple\" it is. The idea of simplicity is present in every facet of the show, all the characters lead very simple countryside lives, have simple motivations and a simple attitude towards other people, which boils down to \"be friendly to others and they will be friendly back.\" All events that take place in the island are quite unremarkable and mundane (one of the symptoms of being a slice of life comedy). All about this anime is quite basic, except for Handa, the protagonist. A frustrated calligrapher struggling to find an identity for his work,sometimes a petty rich boy, sometimes a daring artist. His learning from the new home and embracing of a more carefree life describe his character arc, and make him a symbol for those who desire to lead tranquil lives.\\n\\n\r\n\"Stressed young man moves to rural town to find new meaning in life and improve his art\". When I first read this premise I looked down on it. My preconception was that the series would be some mumbo jumbo about how miserable modern civilization makes us and how we need to reconnect to nature. Luckily, that was not the anime's intention, its focus is actually on human interactions.\\n\\n\r\nAnd how great those interactions are! The pair that steals the spotlight is Handa and Naru, the latter being one of the best little kids in all of anime. They have the funniest and sweetest conversations in the entire series, it is not overselling to say that you watch the show for these two. The rest of the cast is solid as well, although nowhere near as charismatic as the duo, they all have funny moments and do not come off as tropes. The other character besides Handa with a clear development throughout the series is Hiroshi, even if his arc is a bit rushed and could have been more fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nOne of Barakamon's more remarkable accomplishments is how it demonstrates the characters' lifestyle, a very important task considering it is the basis for the main concept of the show. Even if you watched the anime soundless and unsubbed, you would still understand the villagers through their character design (generally short hair, plain clothes such as t-shirts, shorts, sandals, hardly ever wearing school uniforms) and mannerisms. This serves to contrast with Handa, who is always fidgety, paranoid and wore traditional kimonos before changing to casual clothes once he got integrated to the community. The exception to the rule is Hiroshi, who does not sport the carefree visage, reflecting his adolescent wish to move away to achieve greater goals, but still unable to leave his hometown.\\n\\n\r\nThe portrayal of simplicity is not perfect, however. Even the loveable characters can not make up for some of the uninventive storylines. Summer festival and beach episodes are the most infamous among 'fillers', and even if in Barakamon these episodes are not complete garbage, they feel lazy and take the viewer away from the experience of the otherwise good series.\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon is sweet and heartwarming. It does not have the most complex themes or characters, but achieves everything that sets out to do competently, even if it could have expanded in several directions and chose not to in favor of consistency. Nevertheless, it is a good anime series. For all these reasons, and having possibly the best depiction of real children in anime, I suggest you watch it, especially if you are going through a particularly chaotic period of your life.",

You watch the character live in life on the Island and have fun with the locals. It's benevolent, it's funny, the animation style adds to the humor, it's real with character's having understandable flaws which if anything makes them more likable, the translation is great with local islanders having dialogue as if they were from the rural part of the United States, the relationships the main calligrapher develops with the kids on the Islandare extremely touching without being sad, and the music is excellent. Not just the opening theme, but the ending theme is incredible as is the music that plays during the anime. The only two things that come to mind that may be an issue are the mother is a little to physical in her interactions with the characters (at one point she is literally punching another character in the face because of something he said) and given the very loose story and lack of drive from episode to episode it may not be as good if binged watched. These are very small complaints. This is my favorite anime since Tokyo Ghoul. It absolutely wonderful and definitely worth watching. 10/10.",

I enjoyed how the children grew fond of the main character and especially in the comical parts where the kids would teach him new things. I also liked how it was set away from urban life and focused on a rural environment.\r\nThere isn't really an antagonist, just struggles for the protagonist in which the children help him see how to overcome the problems he faces. I highly recommend this Anime ifyou enjoy COMEDY.\\n",

It doesn't necessarily have deep moments, but it is a great anime!\r\nA guy, who has a passion for calligraphy, gets sent to an island and makes friends with the villagers. An island? You can't help but think \"why, an island?\" But even so, it is an island full of friendly villagers. \r\nEvery second of the series makes you laugh. You can't help but find the protagonist's interactions with the children hilarious and adorable. \r\nEverybody makes mistakes. And everybody isn't a Mary-Sue/Gary Stu. It is rare to findanime that has characters with flaws. For example, Handa Seishuu learns and grows as a character. He makes mistakes and tries to reflect on what he has done.\\n\\n\r\nI just like the interactions of Handa and the rest of the villagers. It is heart-warming to watch. So if you're looking for an anime to watch and like a bit of comedy and relaxation, then this is for you! \\n",

            "content": "Never ever have I enjoyed a slice of life comedy series then Barakamon, nor have I ever genuinely laughed to an anime because of it being so relatable. Barakamon even proves that to enjoy an anime you don't need to do the normie bullshit that every other series out there does.\r\nBarakamon is about the story of, Handa Sei, who is a calligrapher and ends up going to a island in the middle of nowhere after punching the Art Gallery director because of Handa's style being textbook, and once he gets there things change for the best for him, and those around him.\r\nThe art is oneof the best things about this show. The character designs are great, the characters all fit the theme of the environment to the show, and even when other characters from when Handa was in Tokyo to visit, even had a realistic element to the country, as it was something it was not used to, and the art depicted the emotions, actions, and the environment to a degree that it almost felt like you were with them in the story, living it yourself.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound I would say is great basically for the same reason as the art, like seriously, you CAN'T beat how well the voice actors did on this show. It was awesome. Even the little kids in the show, that Handa ends up taking care of all the time has a perfect voice that just isn't even hateable, and most Slice of Life Comedy series end up making me hate those characters. The opening and ending are also very good in this series and you can't help but get into the show after it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Barakamon are wonderful. I mean, I've never ever had a series where I can literally no matter what, not dislike a cast of the show. It was just crazy to me, all the characters are lovable, even though they all do have their own share of problems, the people around them all pitched in and a lot of the characters had their own backstory that was even introduced in the anime and wasn't even dragged on for too long, it got to the point, at the right time, and was very enjoyable and was touching for the instances it was brought. It wasn't just poof a dumb problem arises and you need to know about what happened to them, it was realistic events bringing about ways that most people would figure stuff out. The community in the show is more like any other as well.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment level of this series was literally binge watching and wondering why the hell there isn't anymore episodes and I need more now type enjoyment level, I was that enjoyed while watching Barakamon. It had the laughs, it had the ups and downs, it had the growth and development, and it was really all I could ever ask for in a Slice of Life, let alone anime in general. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Barakmon is a MUST WATCH in my opinion to people who like the genre and anime in general. Its a nice change of pace and a show that generally anyone can get into. My friend HATES anime but couldn't stop watching Barakmon with me. If you're even reading to this point on if you should watch the series, just go ahead and do it now, because seriously, don't miss out on this Slice of Life that can set the stone for others of the same genre.",

            "content": "Barakamon review\r\nNaru is cuteand natural way with the help of the characters who are in fact the story for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10 \\n\r\nThe story follows Handa  on a place very  new and unfamiliar to him for the purpose of improving his calligraphy skills, called the Goto island. The main theme this show abords is transition and it\u2019s focused on Handa and how he interacts with the people and how those people influence his choices and help him change. On this island Handa experiences new things that he could not enjoy on his city lifestyle : making new friends, enjoying the beauty of nature, picking fights with grade-school kids, catching beetles and going through a plethora of experiences on the island. On the surface this may seem for many just a way to relax and forget about life problems but all he does and the characters that he interacts with   have a purpose and meaning  in improving his calligraphy skills later .\\n\\n\r\nThe pace of the story is not rushed at all , from the very beginning it\u2019s able to maintain a balanced atmosphere.Handa learns on his own skin how different the life is on that island from his city life and the show evidentiate his frustration also his curiosity to discover and learn new things.We are introduced to the picturesque peisage of the island ,the old traditional houses, we get to meet the people living in that village, their story and circumstances, the way they make a living majority of them from fishing  and finally the silent and relaxing sound of nature which calms our hearts and captivates us. These are the strong points of Barakamon the characters and their surroundings and everything is kept simple ,and Barakamon is a good example that simple is good sometimes for the story and character development.\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon has his unique style with his characters , many of them living a simple life on that island  and many characters having different gaps of age.  Barakamon manages to shine as a slice of life anime because of the way he is able to create the connection and relation between those gap ages characters(kids, high school students, elders) and use them as a whole for the story and  to influence Handa directly or indirectly.\\n\r\nAnother interesting concept aborded by this anime is the fact how a person can change and adapt to a new lifestyle and how the experiences in that new life style helps him improve as a person.This really gives credits to the saying \u201cAs long as we are alive we learn new things everyday  until the moment we die\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe most impressive aspect of this anime is the balance between heart-touching moments and comedy. It\u2019s so well done that everything seems so natural and flows like a river along his course in this case our story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters  9/10 \\n\r\nThe characters are the story in Barakamon and we have a diversity of characters in this anime and a strong point is how the show manages to use them to influence Handa directly or indirectly affecting his decisions and thoughts. \\n\\n\r\nHanda is the main character , he is a calligrapher and at first glance he may seem a serious and mature person but deep down in his heart he is a child. These statement is true when he plays with the kids from the island and explores with them new places learning about their lives and circumtances. These adds a tone a maturity to the show despite the kid characters.Every new experience helps Handa and those minor details are well evidentiated by Barakamon and not casted away helping him reap the fruits of his work ,in this case improving his calligraphy style. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNaru is a little devil who always likes to play pranks on Handa and play with him. She acts exactly like a 7 years old kid is supposed to act , she is spoiled , gets dirty after she plays all day, collects snails and everything is done in a normal and  natural pace by Barakamon.Despite her child behavior and age she sometimes brings a tone of maturity to the show and manages to help I her own way  Handa  to overcome his calligraphy hiatus . This is why Barakamon shines with his characters and manages to impress me as a viewer showing us a lesson of life that kids can help adults in their own way and bring a smile on the face when we are face with the hardships of life.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters are mentionable too we have the Arai symblings who one of them is a hardcore fujoshi , Hiroshi who is Handa\u2019s new neighbour   who helps him in dire situations , and the other villagers and their families. Barakamon manages despite his high number of characters and limited space(12 eps) to develop each of them and the connections and interactions between them is done in a natural flow for the story.   All of those characters help Handa and influence him directly or indirectly in improving his calligraphy skills  in the end.\\n\\n\r\nA major impact on this anime are the kids  with Naru as their pesky leader and despite that Barakamon  still maintains his aura of mature anime because of the way it\u2019s executes his plot and story with those characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 9/10 \\n\r\nUnique animation for each character , stunning visuals for the peisage  which captivates the viewer .\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound and ost fits perfectly with the peisage , characters actions and brings  tons of feels to the viewer. The opening is great  and it\u2019s a good method to overcome a bad day you have when you are sad .\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 \\n\r\nI laughed , I cried, I felt connected to some characters and I saw a great slice of life anime. Also Naru made me forget about my bad day and showed me how beautiful and yet simple life can be if you enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 \\n\r\nGreat slice of life anime with a impactful message to the viewer , stunning visuals  and sound that captivates the viewer and as a conclusion well all learn new things form different persons like this anime evidentiates.\\n",

            "content": "A cute story about a 23 year old young man Handa who we learn has been studying most of his young life to be a calligrapher, as his father was before him.  His father insults his latest calligraphy work and Handa blows his stack and strikes his father, storming out of the room.  Later, it is decided that Handa should spend some time contemplating in a village on a remote island that the father has connections with.\r\nOnce he arrives, he tries to settle in and take in the solitude and isolation, hoping for inspiration and a change of heart.  But he's infor a surprise when he soon discovers that the entire village is interested in him, from the kids to the elderly.  The story really begins with him developing relationships with the simple but lovable people of the village, who call him Sensei due to his respected role as a calligrapher.\\n\r\nThis is a human interest story, pure and simple.  Not much actually happens in terms of plot -- Handa needs to develop maturity and his own style of calligraphy.  The more he tries to push away his nosy admirers, the more they are determined to get know him better.  In the end he discovers the childhood he missed while studying so hard on his vocation, and hilarity ensues as the villagers try to include him in their daily life.\\n\r\nThe little girl Naru steals the show with her impishness, quirky precociousness, and her genuine affection for Handa-sensei.  The other close supporting characters, Miwa, Tama, Hina, Hiroshi and the village chief create an ad-hoc family for Handa, for which he seems to only vaguely appreciate.  However, he needs them more than he realizes, and most of the story develops around Handa learning to be a member of a close-knit community and not an isolated loner.\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this story.  I think it was well written, and the writers did a good job of bringing real humanity to all the core members of the story.  I would love to see a second season where we could see more the people we grew intimate with in the first season.  Definitely recommend if you like a good comedy-drama mix.",

It follows the common \"hard work + perseverance = results\" trope but with its fantastic characters and heartwarming tone it accomplishes what many other anime fail.\r\nThe story is nothing special pretty much just slice of life but with an over arching goal. The real shine comes from the characters which all translate emotion great. From the first episode you will want to see more of Naru, the primary supporting cast member. Most other characters also work well and are what makes this anime so heartwarming.\r\nThe other success of this anime is tone. Often tone iswhere anime falls flat, either becoming too serious or directionless. However Barakamon maintains a feel good tone throughout only pausing to create tension usually hinged on the risk of losing this atmosphere. This works well to keep the watcher engaged while remaining relaxed.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a comfy anime this is a great option 8/10",

Sometimes the kids perception in life and their pure-innocence can be a good inspiration and motivation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [9/10]\\n\r\nwhat Barakamon lacks: 12eps is too few.. \\n\r\nbut it's a good series to cheer you up if you're having a bad day!\\n\r\nenjoyable, heartwarming, funny, inspiring, relaxing\\n\r\nyou can warm your heart even without romance there :)\\n\r\nit's worth to watch!",

            "content": "Barakamon is just too good!\r\nSo long story short, it revolves around something boring, calligraphy. However, what makes the anime so good is actually the characters.\r\nThe anime doesn\u2019t really have a plot, what I love about it is the fact that every episode is pretty casual, not really plot driven allowing it to focus on character development which ultimately allows the characters to reach the final goal of the anime.\r\nHanda is a well known calligraphist that writes his calligraphies by the book and apparently got dissed on because he doesn\u2019t have his own style of writing. He got angry at the director that dissed him andpunched him. He was then sent to an island to \u2018find his style\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nHe met the island residents, lived with them and slowly made his way to perfecting an individual self portrayed calligraphy style. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s actually pretty heart warming to watch as Handa slowly gets used to the country-side life and sort of escape from city life.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat I love the most though is the characters. \\n\r\nHanda met a kid named Naru, she is a cute little girl that has a boy\u2019s character design for some reason, maybe it\u2019s just me... but Naru is so damn cute, her voice is very cute and really fits her playful and always cheerful characteristic! \\n\\n\r\nOur MC is on the other hand, is someone full of pride and gets depressed easily. Sort of the complete opposite of Naru so Naru getting close to him and changing his characteristic to a more caring individual and a better person overall makes it especially heartwarming to watch!\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters (don\u2019t want to spoil) all have very positive attitudes too so MC definitely would get influenced no matter how stubborn he is! And a huge thumbs up to the Seiy\u016bs for doing such a great job bringing the characters to life!\\n\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d say overall, the anime was pretty enjoyable!",

No big revelations.\r\nNo analysis, just my feelings and a general impression - after watching it x1 and before watching it a 2nd time.\r\nJust a few words that I hope will make you want to consider giving this Slice of Life a chance.\r\nThe only thing I\u2019m not gonna talk about in superlatives is\u2026 animation. It isn\u2019t bad, it\u2019s actually pretty good. Yes, pretty good; just nothing mind-blowing! Guys, this isn\u2019t a mecha!\r\nRight off the bet, Barakamon is very touching \u2014 I\u2019m not into Slice of Life and not easily moved by emotional anddramatic blah blah \u2014 and the dialogues feel really real. \\n\r\nThe same goes for the characters themselves - TBH, there aren\u2019t many. Every single one of them has an interesting personality that shines!\\n\r\nNaru and Handa are amazing! And if you don\u2019t know who that is, look at the picture. I mean our main couple and just so you know, they aren\u2019t a real couple, she\u2019s too young to think about lovu-lovu! \\n\r\nAnyway, they help each other out a lot! Now, Naru\u2019s just a child but that doesn\u2019t stop the little girl from helping Handa (aka Sensei) grow. Their relation is to die for!\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I got the impression that nothing was left out; every detail was considered. \\n\r\nRemember what I said - \u201cmy feelings, my impression\u201d.\\n\r\nThe comedy parts are gr8 and actually funny!\\n\r\nYou can expect a lot of goofy moments.\\n\r\nYou can expect a lot of sad moments, too. \\n\r\nThe transmission from happy to sad is flawless. \\n\r\nBe prepared for sadness to fill your heart & be ready to smile!\\n\\n\r\nYes, you can expect a conclusion at the end of this show. \\n\r\nThe ending is very satisfying - now, off you go! \\n\r\nDon\u2019t waste your time on boring reviews.\\n\r\nFor what it is, I\u2019m rating this 9/10 + 1 (from my cheat-bag) to even the score\u2026 yes, I am ignoring mediocre animation. That\u2019s not what I believe this Anime is about. The story\u2019s what matters foremost!",

            "content": "\"A beautiful wonderfully simplistic ride of emotions and motivation\". This is what i would say to describe Barakamon in a sentence. \r\nBarakamon is a story about a calligrapher, who due to his narcissism and impulsiveness ends up on an island for some serious thinking. Story is as simple as it sounds and things will almost happen as you expect them to be, but what sets barakamon apart is its presentation. Story is wounded beautifully with main character in mind, his problems and other aspects of life are subtly explained with the help of side characters. Every episode is different and leads to character development inone way or another and also provides viewer a chance to grow as well. \\n\\n\r\nArt style is simple, nothing unique but soothing which resonates with the opening and ending songs as well as with the subtle background music.\\n\\n\r\nIntriguing aspect about barakamon is character interaction. Characters are from all stages of life. In one episode you will see the energy and playfulness of a child and in other you will be experiencing the wisdom of old. Since story is mainly about the main character you will see little to no development in the character of side characters although most of them are kids and old people anyway which means they are either too young to develop a character or they already have a permanent one. These things are easily ignorable if you can relate with the main character which i believe most of us will. Story focuses on how main character interacts with side character and how they play their role in affecting his life for the better.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally i enjoyed it 100% and will recommend 100 out of 100 times. I wonder why i didn't watched it before.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum up Barakamon is one of those anime you watch without any expectations but slowly turns out to be one of your favorites in the end. This happened to me during the second episode where i could see my failures right in front of me and after that it was one heck of a ride filled with elements of all the feelings.\\n\\n\r\nNamaste!",

            "content": "As a thirteen episode slice-of-life anime there isn't much expectation and it's relaxed vibe, and comical plot, got me interested in it pretty quickly. I wasn't disappointed. \r\nThe story is straight forward which, for once, I quite enjoyed and the goal of everything that happens on screen is also very obvious, and stated a few times. The art, to go along with this, is similarily straight forward and there are instanced where you can see where the budget was really well spent. Considering that, it's amazing how the consistency doesn't drop, but it doesn't which is also very nice. \r\nThe opening and the ending goaccording to the overall theme of the anime and the art of the opening is just beautiful.  The rest of the sound is solid, though considering this can be also labeled a comedy anime you should know to expect a lot of sound bits to go according to the joke, face-expression, etc.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, what I liked most about this anime is exactly the comedy of the moment, and then the storyline. The characters are all solid with their own aspirations, and the anime isn't afraid to poke at modern tropes like 'fujoshi fangirl' which got me rolling with laughter. \\n\r\nBut, I warn you, this isn't anime to be watched twice. The comedic effect just isn't the same.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a bit of relaxing after an intense anime, and if you want to laugh a lot, I suggest this one. I sincerely hope for season two.",

            "content": "Ah, slice of life. A genre that tends to hit-or-miss for me. It's amazing how sometimes anime about nothing can be absolutely great and a lot of fun or completely useless and boring. Thankfully, Barakamon goes for the former.\r\nSTORY (8/10):\r\nBarakamon's story is nothing special as a concept, but the way the anime executes it is what makes it so great. The way our protagonist evolves throughout the series makes it into a captivating watch.\r\nART (8/10):\r\nThe series has quite above-average artwork on most occasions. However, it occasionally uses simplistic, childish designs, totally on purpose, in beautiful ways.  However, visual gags tend to be hit ormiss (there's one in episode 5 a lot of people disliked). \\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are better than most anime, though nothing I'd go out of my way to listening to. The voice acting is really good, and I like the fact that the children are voiced by actual children, a rare occurrence in anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned earlier the protagonist's evolution throughout the series. It truly is something to see this loner workaholic change and come out of his shell as he becomes more comfortable with the people on the island. \\n\\n\r\nNaru also is forever on my list of favorite anime characters. She's just so cute, and the best portrayal of childhood innocence I've ever seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThere was one character I strongly disliked, and that was Seishuu's mother. Thankfully, she's only introduced in the final two episodes and plays a minor role. If she had stuck around any longer she would have hendered my enjoyment of the series quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nI am a naturally anxious person, and watching Barakamon helped me with that at times. Ah, the joys of a good slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you like slice of life, definitely watch Barakamon. If you don't like slice of life, still give Barakamon a shot. You'll be pleasantly surprised at the amount of story and character development this slice of life has - it's far from a show about nothing.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nCONTENT ADVISORY: Some episodes are completely clean, while others have some mild language and suggestive humor. (Even still, the PG-13 rating on MAL seems a little strict.) The official subtitles from FUNimation are cleaner than the fansubs, so I'd go with those for younger viewers.",

            "content": "After the disappointing trash that was GJ-bu, I was in a supreme mood for a good comedy to help me find a reason to live (again). After a few minutes of debating with the pink monkeys in my mind on whether I should re-watch the first season of \u2018Working!\u2019, I suddenly remembered the little white shirted brat from some show called \u2018Barakamon\u2019 people could just not get of back when it released.\r\nThank you, white shirted kid who I thought was boy but I turned out to be a girl who kind of sounds like the son of a helium container, Barakamon was downright hilarious.\r\nAs thesynopsis shows, Barakamon is a slice-of-life comedy with just a tad bit of drama to start things off.\\n\\n\r\nHanda is a brilliant and arrogant calligrapher who has won many prizes. One day, after receiving harsh criticism from an oldie calligrapher, Handa goes haywire and decks him withe rage of a thousand ones and a half. He is then kicked onto a remote island by his dad so he can reflect on his actions. When Handa arrives at his new home and meets the resident rascal, white shirted Naru, he can\u2019t even imagine how loud and crazy his life is going to get.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s pretty much it. There\u2019s no over-arching plot or any visible goal that the anime\u2019s story wants to go towards. Even though this is slice-of-life to a tee, the setting is somewhat unique so major props to that in an industry where slice-of-life comedies are as common as atheists in a Neon Genesis Evangelion forum.\\n\\n\r\nThere are no melodramatic events or scenes that reek of cheap laughter. Barakamon is a finely thought-out comedy centered on a creator\u2019s re-invention of his style and the environment that helps mould his transformation. The gags are creative and plentiful. They don\u2019t feel like they\u2019ve been set up for laughs: they occur naturally as how they would in real life. A kid performs kancho (butt-stabbing) on Handa when he arrives at the village and gets told off his dad. Naru\u2019s misunderstanding and repetition of bad words she hears the people around them say. Handa sulking childishly in a corner when he loses a competition. They feel real and illicit genuine laughter out of you. So in the comedy compartment, Barakamon excels with flying colors.\\n\\n\r\nThe many different events that happen over the course of Barakamon develop and flesh out the characters and the village as a whole so the storytelling is also top-notch. Even the very minor subtle things happening in the background of various scenes tell you a lot about the characters and the way they interact with other.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, the cast of Barakamon is absolutely lovable and the characters reel you in very quickly with their debut appearances. Well, except for the kid who does kancho on Handa in the first episode. The supporting characters are based on stereotypes but are fleshed out so well and given individual attention so much that they don\u2019t even seem like supporting characters by the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nHanda goes from a downright narcissistic busybody \u2018no fun allowed\u2019 impulse driven man-child to a lovable person who deeply worries about and cares for the people around him on the island \u2013 while growing as an artist and learning about the joys and pains of an unrestricted life. Naru is boisterous and mischievous to the core and really enjoys annoying Handa and making him play with her while Hina, Naru\u2019s friend, usually cries and is rather clumsy.\\n\\n\r\nThe children feel like they are actual children. From their voices to the way they behave with both each other and the grown-ups of the show, you know a lot of heart and soul went into them and also because they are voiced by actual children \u2013 who have actual voice acting talent! They are VASTLY different from the usual fare of kids present in most anime.\\n\\n\r\nEven the three teenagers of a rowdy girl athlete, a fujoshi, and a mature guy who is somewhat worried about his future after highschool are extremely fun and their personal fears, craziness, and quirks are given a spot in the light.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is done by Kinema Citrus studio of \u2018Tokyo Magnitude 8.0\u2019 and \u2018Yuyushiki\u2019 fame. It bright and vibrant with a nice and warm contrast with colors and the backgrounds. The animation can go from very detailed to chibi-ish depending on what\u2019s happening in a scene. It\u2019s good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music\u2026 well, I don\u2019t remember the background music which is kinda weird since I binged the show last night. I guess that means it was forgettable. The moody country-esque Opening was a delight to listen to. The quite straightforward Ending that sounds like a blast from 2001 highschool rock bands takes some getting used to \u2013 which isn\u2019t a bad thing since the warm watercolor visuals are just calming to look at.\\n\\n\r\nI really REALLY enjoyed Barakamon and it\u2019s now in the top 15 of my list of anime comedies to recommend to people when they ask for suggestions. The problem I have with the show is that Naru should have had a much larger impact on events and more screen-time in the last two episodes (describing this in last paragraph as it\u2019s a spoiler). Because of that and the thing with the background music, Barakamon is a swift 9/10 show for me. Highly recommended.\\n\\n\r\n(In the last few episodes, Handa leaves the island out of the blue without saying goodbye and then returns in the same fashion. During his absence and after his return, Naru\u2019s presence is pushed back to that of a background character\u2019s. She gets relatively very little screen-time and the few lines she does say don\u2019t have as much impact as they should for someone who was the main force in aiding the change in Handa\u2019s calligraphy in personality. I feel she should have gotten a much more major role in the last episodes since she\u2019s very important to Handa and vice versa. Just saying. This doesn\u2019t mean that how the ending is handled isn\u2019t bad by any means. It\u2019s actually very good. It just could have been\u2026 much better, in my opinion.)",

            "content": "Barakamon is an excellent anime that faithfully adapts it's source material.  It is with a slight bitterness that I have to give the series a 7, for reasons that feel a bit unfair even as I type them. I will do my best to explain exactly what those reasons are. But first, lets get a look at what Barakamon gets right, which turns out is almost all of it.\r\nSlice of life anime is at its best when serving up slices of life that the viewer might not be familiar with. In this respect, Barakamon hits you on two fronts: Calligraphy and the Goto islands.When dealing with content that viewers are likely detached from in their real lives, producers must find a way to lasso interest from a skeptical audience.\\n\\n\r\nThey did a great fucking job. The Goto islands are brought to life beautifully with very colorful and beautiful animation. The story is focused and tight, grounded by an excellent cast of characters with fantastic personalities. I say this in every review: If I must criticize one thing about anime in general, it's that it often lacks focus and loses its way among the setting and cast. Barakamon does not even come close to committing such a grave error.\\n\\n\r\nSo how do the producers accomplish this? Simple. They anchor the two larger focal points of the show (The Goto islands and Calligraphy) onto two characters. Seishu Hanada is from the world of calligraphy, a man who lives and pains over his art form. Naru Kotoishi is a young rascal from the Goto islands, completely immersed in the distinct local cultural.\\n\\n\r\nEach is clueless about the world of the other, but this provides the basis for their relationship. Each character impresses upon the other and teaches each other about their world. This dynamic also helps inform the audience, because while watching you tend to feel like you are learning about these two respective slices of life from people whom are experts. You are ignorant and they will teach you.\\n\\n\r\nBut Barakamon is more than just it's setting. If I were to illuminate the entire cast and their interwoven relationships, I could paint you a beautiful complex web of intermingling worlds. But then I would spoil every minor detail of the series and get my review taken down, so lets not. I'll just comment that the entire cast is charming and funny, and return to Naru and Hanada.\\n\\n\r\nFor Hanada, this story is more than just about his struggles with his calligraphy. He wants his own unique style, but this is just a symptom of his struggles as a human being. He is a flawed, talented person whose growth has been stunted by his relationship with his family, and his tendency to let his environment dictate his path in life. The great thing about him, is that he's not a hammy awful person. He doesn't start off as some painful tsundere archetype that makes you want to gag. Seishu Hanada could be any young man with emotional struggles, not totally beyond redemption, but clearly has some growing up to do. Naru, like she is a mentor of the Goto islands, is a mentor of emotional maturity to Hanada.\\n\\n\r\nDid that last paragraph seem to end abruptly? I should hope so, because that's quite indicative of Barakamon's glaring issue as an adaptation. The two main characters and their relationship is supposed to be the pillars that hold up Barakamon. It very much begins this way. To be clear, this relationship never once falters. The chemistry between these two is impeccable, accompanied by a fantastic voice cast to bring them to life.\\n\\n\r\nThe issue is that the story slowly shifts from being about the two of them as pillars, and Naru begins to form a strong base on Hanada's pillar. The relationship is still there, and Hanadas story arc is VERY strong. However, Naru's importance to the story is shown in her importance to Hanada's arc, and she starts to lose her footing as an equal main character in the show. This one pillar holds the series up quite well, but you can't help but feel that things could have been better with Naru receiving her due attention.\\n\\n\r\n\"But the manga...!\"\\n\\n\r\nStop right there fellow weeb. I agree entirely with what you are about to say, which is why this so frustrating. The creators nailed their pacing perfectly. They picked an excellent spot to end the first season, and handled their adaptation of the source material quite well. But therein lies our issue. The creators proceeded their adaptation as though they would get to adapt the entire manga. They even picked a great spot to end a hypothetical first season. Had this stellar crew been given a second season, my hunch is that this anime would sit on my top 10 list proudly. The previously mentioned issues with Naru's role would have also been irrelevant, as the story in the manga addresses this later. \\n\\n\r\nBut because this anime is the complete work of Barakamon as an anime adaptation, it does not get the benefit of Barakamons complete story. You can pace your marathon perfectly, but it means little if the finish line is stolen from you. So in short: Watch Barakamon, it's fantastic, but read the manga to fill the tiny shortcoming that the anime will leave you with. A shortcoming it would not have if the whole story was told.",

            "content": "I came across Barakamon while browsing through the Anime list in MAL. Initally decided not to watch it as the premise didn't excite me. But gave it a try after some time and it simply ended up being the best slice of life anime for me!\r\nNow to get into the review-\r\n                     Story-8\r\nAs i mentioned earlier, the story in itself is not that captivating. The protogonist, Handa a caligrapher, is sent to an island by his father for mending his ways and discovering his own caligraphystyle.( the synopsis explains it really well so I'm not going into details). Caligraphy is all he has done in his entire life.\\n\r\n(a result of being brought up in such an environment by his father,who is also a caligrapher). He has no friends and has a hard time socialising with people(or rather hates it!). And the rest of the story is how  Handa gradually begins to open up his heart, have fun with the people in the island and matures both as a person and a caligrapher.\\n\\n\\n\r\n                     Art-10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is outstanding! The characters(especially Naru), the island are all animated really well. It is definitely one of the best!\\n\\n\\n\r\n                      Sound-10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and the ending songs capture the feel of the anime perfectly. \\n\r\nUsually i skip the opening after watching 1 or 2 episodes but i couldn't do so with Barakamon! I just had to hear it before starting the episode!\\n\\n\\n\r\n                        Character-10\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to find words to describe the characters! All of the characters are heart warming and just give off a vibe of positivity The main characters are Naru- A six year old kid and Handa  who get most of the screentime. Naru can be mistaken for a bothersome child at the begining, but boy she breathes life into the anime. Handa even though being an adult learns a lot from her as to how to have fun in life without worrying too much about the future. Humour is top notch in this anime. The predicament in which Handa is always put into by the cheekiness of Naru,Miwa and Tama are hilarious!\\n\r\nAnd the childish actions of Handa is a joy to watch. Its not only these characters, the side characters are also given appropriate screen time despite this being a short anime. It would not be wrong to say that characters make the anime what it is!! Anyways, I don\"t want to dwell into the rest of the characters and make it a really long review!\\n\\n\\n\r\n There was not even a single episode that couldn't make me laugh. But at the same time it was not just about the jokes but also the feelings this anime stimulates that makes it so good and enjoyable. I would say its a must watch for all anime lovers!!\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review and if there were any shortcoming please highlight them. I would be more than happy to correct them next time! \\n\\n\\n",

The story takes place on an island, so you will be able to watch beatiful landscapes, with bright and cheerful colours. The characters are adorable: the main character, a caligrapher, learns a little bit about real life and friendship when he gets to meet the local people. Also if you are interested in japanese culture, you get to know a little bit more about what \"shodo\" is (the art of japanese calligraphy).\r\nWhy I love it? Because it cheers me up everytime I watch it (It's so sad that there is just one season!). I was able to know a different side of japanese culture, the country, with lovely people, and shodo. Finally, it reaminds me the important thing of life, the most important one besides work, success, or recognition: friendship. And, of course, I always enjoy Daisuke Ono's voice!.\\n\\n\r\nSpanish:\\n\\n\r\nPor qu\u00e9 hay que ver Barakamon? \\n\r\nPorque es un anim\u00e9 muy relajante, que tambi\u00e9n te hace re\u00edr, as\u00ed como, a veces, botar una peque\u00f1a l\u00e1grima. La historia se desarrolla en una isla, por lo que podr\u00e1 ver hermosos paisajes, con colores brillantes y llenos de vida. Los personajes son adorables: el personaje principal, un cal\u00edgrafo, aprende un poco m\u00e1s sobre la vida real y la amistad cuando se relaciona con los lugare\u00f1os. Adem\u00e1s, si est\u00e1 interesado en la cultura japonesa, puede aprender un poco m\u00e1s acerca de qu\u00e9 es el \"shodo\" (el arte japon\u00e9s de la caligraf\u00eda).\\n\\n\r\nPor qu\u00e9 me encanta? \\n\r\nPorque me reanima cada vez que lo veo (\u00a1Es lamentable que solo haya una temporada!). Me fue posible conocer un lado diferente de la cultura japonesa, el campo, con gente muy amable, y el shodo. Por \u00faltimo, me recuerda las cosas importantes de la vida, la m\u00e1s importante m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del trabajo, el \u00e9xito, o el reconocimiento: la amistad. Y, por supuesto, \u00a1siempre disfruto al escuchar la voz de Daisuke Ono!\\n\\n",

            "content": "(No spoilers)\r\nBarakamon is a modern classic in the slice-of-life genre. There, I said it. Someone had to. Watching it you'll feel a slow smile creep up your face. It's about inspiration and the relationship between the characters. It's poignant at times without being pretentious or emotionally manipulative. \r\nThe characters of any medium have to be relatable to cross that boundary of imaginary fiction and be a real meaningful figure. And barakamon has those characters. At the end you will become close with the characters as if you're part of the group too. Handa, our lead protagonist, is temperamental and moody like most people. He doesthings in the spur-of-the moment but also apologises after a realisation. He fails in finding inspirations for his profession of caligraphy but is determined to achieve something unique. The show mainly concerns with Handa chasing after his goal of finding his own style of caligraphy, and also the surrounding bond between the characters. Most characters support Handa in some way or are helped by him.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important and intresting one is Naru. Naru is our small child protagonist who is the biggest source of inspiration for Handa (directly or indirectly). Also, she's  a ball of sunshine who will have you smiling with her meme face and childish ways. In the show, you will slowly see her unravel and understand her. Credits to the small child who voice acted her, because she does a damn good job.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen complaints about the character development of Handa, because each episode he seems to be taking a step forward and is back at the starting point in the next. That's missing the point. The development is supposed to be gradual. Each chapter is an anecdote. It's life and not some fairy tale (tail) where you just level up after being trapped in an island. And it's not as if the show just meanders around because the goal set out at first is achieved in some way. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters do contribute, however you won't see them grow as much as the other two. Well, they are the protagonists for a reason.\\n\\n\r\nBarakamon in one word is charming. I mostly explore the slice-of-life genre in the medium of anime. Most people dismiss it as a genre of boredom where nothing happens. Barakamon sets out to prove those wrong.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

(overall Barakamon 9/10)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \r\nWhat a joy, what a pleasure!\r\nSuch a simple, emotional and inspiring story.\r\nBeing inspired isn\u2019t easy and the world pressures you to always be inspired and creative.\r\nThe problem is: you can\u2019t force yourself. The creative side of the brain doesn\u2019t work like the rational part of it, working hard as you can might help, but doesn\u2019t solve the artistic block. Seishuu Handa (the main character) is a young and promising calligrapher (yes that\u2019s a thing and it\u2019s quite interesting) that will learn to live slowly, far from the busy and troubling Tokyo. \r\nLife happens too fast, if we couldjust slow down and see the details of everything with the eyes of a child, we definitely would be satisfied and ready to improve (in anything) and grow. Being inspired is just a matter of being curious, I think.\\n\r\nThe story is quite simple, the pacing of the show is remarkable and that is quite important for a slice of life show. There is definitely comedy and it\u2019s good, far from stupid, the way I enjoy it the most. The realism is impressive and it appeals to me, the characters do the most ordinary tasks that can be done in the Goto island, in a very charming and heart-warming way. Seishu will discover a very simple way of living and a way of dealing with the 10x10^10 frustrations of being an artist (and in a deeper level, of being human and unsatisfied by nature).\\n\r\nThe art fits the story and the setting beautifully. The 12 episodes are very enjoyable and relaxing (but not boring!) to watch, especially after a long day.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Britt: Hi everyone. Today I'm going to be reviewing an anime I just recently finished called: Barakamon. Let me start off by saying that this anime is definitely one of my favorites, and before I even start reviewing it, I'm going to recommend it. But of course I'm going to give you the details and actually review the show. I'm just letting you all know now that I looooved this anime, and I'm going to explain why right now. Start the review! :D\r\nStory: (Copied from \"My Anime List\")\r\n\"Seishuu Handa is an up-and-coming calligrapher: young, handsome, talented, and unfortunately, a narcissist to boot. When a veteranlabels his award-winning piece as \"unoriginal,\" Seishuu quickly loses his cool with severe repercussions.\\n\\n\r\nAs punishment, and also in order to aid him in self-reflection, Seishuu's father exiles him to the Goto Islands, far from the comfortable Tokyo lifestyle the temperamental artist is used to. Now thrown into a rural setting, Seishuu must attempt to find new inspiration and develop his own unique art style\u2014that is, if boisterous children (headed by the frisky Naru Kotoishi), fujoshi middle schoolers, and energetic old men stop barging into his house! The newest addition to the intimate and quirky Goto community only wants to get some work done, but the islands are far from the peaceful countryside he signed up for. Thanks to his wacky neighbors who are entirely incapable of minding their own business, the arrogant calligrapher learns so much more than he ever hoped to.\"\\n\\n\r\nYup. So basically the story is about a narcissistic calligrapher who gets sent to the country side to learn a thing or two about respect. While there he runs into the townsfolk, who are all very friendly people who welcome him there. He soon realizes that being with them makes him happy. Happier than he's ever been. He definitely learns his lesson of course. And funny enough, his best friend from the village is an energetic 6-7 year old girl that warms his heart. I think the story is very easy to understand, and it's very cute and not over the top. It's a slice of life anime, so expect random things to happen almost every episode. Episode 9 and 11 are particularly hilarious to me, though the whole show can be freaking hilarious at times, too.\\n\r\nI give the story a.....7/10 :)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAll the characters are likable. Even Seishuu with his narcissism is a really great character. Even all the nosy villagers and annoying children bothering Seishuu. Even the guy who's technically Seishuu's rival. They're all so likable! The main character is Seishuu Honda. A 23 year old calligrapher who deems himself perfect, till one day an older man called his work \"unoriginal\" or even \"mediocre.\" Being the guy that he is, Seishuu punched the man in his face (no joke) then got sent to the countryside by his father so he could learn some sense. He's a pretty cool guy. He's annoyed by the villagers at first, but warms up to them soon. They all invade his privacy anyway, so gotta get used to them, right? He was a jerkwad at first, but he learned to not be such a perfectionist anymore. The people living there (mostly Naru) helped him realize his passion while also being a good person in the process. Moving me onto this next character: Naru Kotoishi. Naru is a loudmouth little girl who in all honesty, acts the way real kids do. She loves to play around, she loves bothering people, she loves going outside hanging with her friends, she loves receiving gifts and going to festivals and whatnot. I'd say the creators of the series hit the nail on the head with this girl. When she met Sensei--oh sorry. Forgot to mention that all the villagers forgot Seishuu's real name almost immediately, and just started calling him Sensei instead (he didn't seem to mind too much, though.) but yeah, when Naru met Sensei, I'd say she grew attached to him rather quickly. He's like a father-figure of sorts to her. He plays with her, gives her gifts, takes her to festivals and whatnot, and I could really feel the bond between these too. Naru is a very funny character. She's adorable, she's realistic, she's kindhearted, and she's super funny. I'm sure anyone watching this show would instantly fall in love with this girl. Moving onto the next characters, we have: Miwa Yamakura. A 14 year old tomboyish girl who has a key to Sensei's house so she enters whenever she pleases. She's not a very good influence on Naru. Naru often repeats Miwa's bad habits, causing Sensei to scold her. Next is Tamako Arai. Another 14 year old girl who's best friends with Miwa. She has a thing for writing yaoi (BL/ Boys Love) doujinshi, and also having odd fantasies when seeing two men together in the same place. She also has a spare key to Sensei's house. Next we have Hiroshi Kido; a high school student who's also the son of the village chief. He's a pretty average guy, who Tamako thinks would make an adoring boyfriend for Sensei. Wouldn't you know it, though? He also has a key to Sensei's house! We also have Hina Kubota. She's Naru's best friend, and she's a crybaby. When I say crybaby, I really mean it, too. The slightest touch to her arm could probably cause her to bawl her eyes out. She's still a cutey pie nonetheless. There are plenty and I mean PLENTY of other great characters to get to know, but I don't want to spend too much time on this section of the review. I'll just let you guys see them for yourselves ;)\\n\r\nI give the characters an 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nThe opening theme song, titled \"The LiBERTY\", was performed by Fo'xTails, while the ending theme song, titled \"HIDE-AND-SEEK\", was performed by Kenichi Suzumura. I don't know anything about Kenichi or Fo'xTails, so I can't really recommend anymore of their music to you, but I enjoyed the opening and ending themes. Weeeeell, I think they both fit the anime pretty well, but they aren't my favorite songs in the world. They're far from terrible, they're just not my kind of music. They're kinda slow but fast at the same time if that makes sense. So, I don't hate either songs, but I don't love them, either. They're good and they fit the anime, so it's all fine. I don't remember much of the music playing in the background of the episodes though, so I can't give much detail on that. I watched this anime dubbed like I almost always do, and I think the characters voices were just fine as well. No complaints there. The art was decent enough, too. Like a lot of other anime, the opening and ending animations are usually....well....animated better than the actual episodes. I think this applies here. Now, the animation studio is: Diomed\u00e9a. I've...never heard of them before. I can't tell you what other shows they've animated that I've seen, since I honestly don't know. I think they did an average job here. The animation isn't perfect, like say Kyoto Animation, but it's not terrible, either. Sometimes the characters would look just fine, and other times they'd look awkward. Particularly on their feet. I can relate to this however since feet and hands are very difficult to draw, sometimes even professionals struggle with those parts of the body, but I'm not gonna lie. Sometimes the characters had some strange and ugly looking feet, haha. I give the sound a solid 6 out of 10, while the art gets a .7 out of 10. Not horrible, but not perfect, either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment:\\n\r\nI loved it. I loved this show. What more can I really say? As I said at the start already: Yes. I recommend this anime to you. If you're sitting at home bored and just wanna watch a random, lighthearted, comedy, slice-of-life, cutesy anime, then this is the show for you! All the characters are likable, and they're pretty funny (especially Naru.) And this show is family friendly. So if you got some family members out there who enjoy anime like you do, I totally suggest watching this with them. I'm sure this awesome show will make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside once you finish it, and it's only 12 episodes! In short, this show was great and you should all definitely watch it if you haven't already. I give Barakamon a solid .9/10.\\n\\n\r\nHope you all enjoyed my review! :D",

            "content": "This will be my first ever review so sorry for any mistakes.\r\nBarakamon is a refreshing easygoing anime. Something you don't need very much energy or attention to sit through. Nothing gets too heavy and the atmosphere is very lax.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story of the show is quite simple, which is fitting for the mood of the show. The plot has no overall conflict and its really just 12 episodes of the characters playing around. The humor of the show is surprising enjoyable as well. \r\nArt: 8 \r\nThe art and animation are well done in terms of quality and the color is just as stunning. the useof light colors gives more of the feeling that they're in a rural town.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nNothing much to say here. The sounds were fairly generic and while the ink splashes sounded great it didn't affect the overall show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the show are all lovable. It works out even better when you put Handa who isn't very good at socializing with a bunch of country folk who are all very local with each other. It creates scenarios that you don't usually get with animes like these.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nI gotta say the show was incredibly enjoyable and so were the characters. The humor is great and the setting is comfortable. However because the shows story doesn't have a plot line to go down the story can get repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nA very laid back and fun show to watch. Even if you're not into these kind of SoL 12 episodes of playing kind of animes, i still recommend you try Barakamon. \\n\\n",
