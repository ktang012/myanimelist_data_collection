            "content": "This anime is takes itself too seriously by trying to be 'deep' on the premise of 'friendship'. It fails horribly and characters act irrational on a basis such as \"you called me a friend\". The characters themselves come off as bland and again try to be deep with their single layered backstory or motives which just makes it even more laughable. After four episodes out of twelve I couldn't even remember what the plot was and I didn't even care because it seemed like they didn't even care themselves. If you like staring at your screen as long as theres something moving then you couldtolerate this anime.",

            "content": "I've currently watched all 4 episodes of this anime so far. Rating on those aired 4 episodes, i think the story is very interesting. This anime isn't focused on a tragedy or a romance anime, but it still made me shed tears near the end of the 4th episode. Therefore, for story i give it an 9. It meets my requirements and i genuinely enjoy animes that can make me emotionally unstable because it just shows how much attention i'm giving the anime.\r\nFor the art, it looks rather basic. Lol im kidding, i think the art is cute. Kuro's fashion makes me think moe, butuh that's not the point. The art is exceeds my average standards. Leading my rating for it, another 9.\\n\\n\r\nFor sound wise, i'm not sure if i enjoyed it too much. The voice actors were incredible however, as always. The opening did match the the of the anime so although the beat wasn't quite my taste, I did understand. Sound gets an 7.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the characters in the anime were the main part it was so interesting. Kuro's lazy personality really helped lighten the anime and made it easier for the watcher to consume. The story in general about vampires isn't realistic but the MC displays realistic human emotion which helps the person watching relate a little. The supporting characters made me feel like they were really needed to bring the story up as they did their job well. Sometimes in animes, the supporters don't do the job well which make watchers think that they're not needed in general. With these details included, this section scores yet another 9.\\n\\n\r\nFinally the enjoyment, this may just be personal because everyone has their own enjoyment level on different animes, but mine was a 10. This anime led me on with plot development and suspense. I couldn't wait for the next episode and when i realised i had finished watching all the currently aired ones, i was rather devastated.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime scores a whooping 9. I suggest you try out this anime if you have nothing better to do or you're looking for an anime to really make you excited.\\n\\n\r\nThis concludes my review.",

            "content": "I have seen plenty of Josei anime to the point I can surely say what makes it quite distinguishing from other genre is that most of the time, it consisting characters driven story and has high attention to the realism. Servamp caught my interest because it happens to fallen to be one of the genres and it ended up to be exceptional. Exceptional that it is so badly done that ends up being counterproductive.\r\nThe story of Servamp follows Mahiru... actually; the main story is pretty much covered in the synopsis, so there isn't much reason for me to regurgitate the same thing in different words.Long story short, Servamp is really something we\u2019ve seen hundreds of times before; ordinary high school boy meets weird stuff (in this case black cats) and gets caught in a live or die situation with all convenient we\u2019ve come to expect of such story. \\n\\n\r\nNow, in all respect there\u2019s nothing wrong with a premise that is lack of originality. But servamp just feel\u2026. quite empty. The plot is just something you encounter in battle shounen series; if you\u2019re looking for in-depth plot then look further because the show doesn\u2019t had any. Everything in the plot is pretty clear black and white, the bad guy is obvious and the good guy is always on the side good guys. The first few episodes are generally geared towards comedy with little real progression. The actual comedy isn't too bad and some moments are fairly funny, but hit or miss jokes aren't enough to make something entertaining. The series then shifts to more of a battle shounen with action, however, the action isn\u2019t that much interesting and feels rushed because most of the time it ended with always ends with one slash. I\u2019d also like to mention the tone is pretty I don\u2019t know\u2026 not appropriate? because the show explained that the bad vampires is a creature that kills human, yet everything is feel so mundane and light, there no sense of urgency; it is as if the show doesn\u2019t take the whole the matters seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters well... we get to see the major protagonist and the major villain gets a backstory (which is all sad/ tragic story by the way) but somehow it wasn\u2019t full enough to make us sympathize with them. The supporting is even worse, because they don\u2019t even have time due to the short length. One of the prime example is Misono, on which his dreams is to protect people, but it never be explained why he do so considering he looks like some rich boy who doesn\u2019t care with anyone.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, due to the short length, many of the questions raised are left unanswered, coupled with an unsatisfying conclusion (not that it concludes anything), which ends just as it seems the real story is about to begin; it told the viewers there are seven servamp based of seven sins yet at the end of the series there are only five present and the ending was cop out and feels like Disney\u2019s ending. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is the art, which is certainly Servamp best area. But even then, it is not above series in at least 2 years back. There are a wide range of colors used for all of the characters, which is nice but it the background are just present I guess. The animation quality is decent. There are a few instances where they turn it up a notch, but this is mostly for action scenes, which rarely last more than two minutes. all in all it is competent to today standard.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was okay. The opening were all right and suited the series but were also pretty generic themes. The opening theme was slightly better as it set up the episodes quite well, and the visuals associated with it were actually relevant to the story of the anime. The rest of the soundtrack, while not being anything noteworthy, matched the mood of the scenes and worded well overall. However, I found the ED to be terrible, but that\u2019s more like luxury than actual criticism.\\n\\n\r\nServamp is a pretty underwhelming action/comedy series The early couple of episodes maybe mildly entertaining, but as a whole the series is quite frustrating, due to a lack of any real closure. We\u2019re introduced to an extensive cast, but many of them lacked a decent back story. Mahiru, being the main character, wasn't particularly interesting, but the side characters were, even if most were given very little time to shine. It's in the middle episodes, where it feels very rushed, that most of the enjoyment is lost. The production values are solid, but nothing to blow anyone away. I would also like to mention, that if you are expecting to see traditional vampires, then you will be generally disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nA forgotten series and probably one of few Josei series that I personally found bad.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The top rated review for this being a '3' seems very exaggerated. An anime that is rated a '3' lacks not only in story, but also art, sound and character. Here's why that is not true:\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThis is a setting that many have seen before. Normal High School student is met with the supernatural and pulled into a whole different world. So far, it doesn't seem like there is anything too amazing about it. However, I have not yet encountered a story in which said supernatural creature is literally THE most lazy person in the show, which often helps loosen the 'deep' mood that thestory is going for with an amusing comment about how he'd rather take a nap than do anything 'bothersome'.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation is great, and the character design is a very favorite of mine. Bright colors, distinctive character designs so that you don't get confused about who is who - nothing to complain about here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI really love the opening by Oldcodex that suits the anime's darker theme, but also the ending that gives you a more upbeat and happy-go-lucky feeling if there has been a particularly 'dark' episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe main character is your everyday hero who wants to protect his friends and do everything right, which comes across as a bit generic at times. What really pulled me in was Kuro, the second main character, who (while being one of the laziest people on Earth) still manages to be powerful when needed, and also funny at times.\\n\\n\r\nA few episodes in is when the character development of Kuro starts to happen, when you start getting a deeper look into what has happened in his past.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI really cannot say I disliked watching any of these episodes. I'm always looking forward to the next one, and can't say that I felt like I wasted time with any of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIf you're someone who enjoys an anime with a pretty art style and bright colors, an anime that is somehow 'deep' but still manages to bring in funny and amusing scenes (sometimes when you least expect it), then I highly recommend this to you.",

            "content": "At first I just brush off this anime like those typical shounen, blah, plain MC ect. But somewhere through the 3rd and 4th episode, Mahiru grew on me. Not because he is anything special but the way he thinks. I can't deny that Mahiru's words are gonna stick with me the rest of my life. No matter when or where, there is always people hoping that 'someone' would come and because that 'someone' would definitely appear, the world keeps going. It isn't gonna be just him or just Kuro but it will be them.\r\nIf it's Kuro's problem, Mahiru has to be there, there isn't anythingto be faced alone. The problem might be Kuro's but Mahiru is his eve, his partner and his 'reason'. (as Mikuni had said) And seriously, despite everything, do you guys really want this to be 'oh I stab the antagonist, he ded, the end' is that kind of ending what you want? I think the ending was quite nice and peaceful and it wasn't unpleasant. It was a nice change. I don't need to see blood flying everywhere and people dying to call it a GREAT VICTORY! =_=\\n\\n\r\nLicht, Lawless, Kuro, Mahiru, Tsubaki and Sakuya are really interesting characters and even though the anime did not best in showing off characters such as the Pride pair and Lust pair, C3 as such, it did made some great show out of the more standing out ones. I enjoy the Greed pair the most (no surprise)\\n\\n\r\nI guess one of the reason I liked this anime is because there are a lot of angst going on in some anime now *COUGHDANGANRONPACOUGH* and not only that, because people now a-days just keeps spamming horror/angst/negative emotions. I really like how this anime turns out despite it's various flaw.",

            "content": "Looking for a series that constantly likes to add characters and ideas, then let it all pile up and do nothing with them? If that\u2019s the case, then \u201cServamp\u201d is right up your ally.\r\nTo make things clear, I do not mind the ideas the show has to offer. I found the concept of Servamps and Eves to be quite interesting. The problem I had with it was how everything was presented. Each episode gave us new subplots after another where eventually we have a bunch of things happening at the same time with almost no conclusion. It then makes me question what the main plotis because when something new happens, that suddenly takes priority. By the time the series finished, many things were left discarded and unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the plot, the characters never go anywhere in terms of personality. They just appear and decide to be involved in the conflict like it was nothing. The main characters have zero presence and don\u2019t even feel like main characters. I had a hard time figuring out who the actual antagonist was or if there even was one. It\u2019s not an exaggeration when I say that we get two of more characters introduced each episode. We\u2019re overwhelmed with all of these people who have little to no presence. There is one thing I would like to mention. Each of the Servamps represent one of the seven deadly sins, and two of them are disregarded save for a flashback scene way later into the show. It was to my surprise that these two had appeared within five chapters of the manga, which baffles me because I don\u2019t know why that choice was made.\\n\\n\r\nThe only positive thing I can say about it is the animation. It\u2019s actually not that bad. The character designs were unique and each episode was often consistent. The action sequences weren\u2019t terrible, but still a bit uninteresting. I did like it when the style changed like when a Servamp was using its powers or we were inside their minds.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it had some good ideas and animation, \u201cServamp\u201d is still pretty boring with nothing to it. If I may be completely honest, the only thing that I truly got out of the show was the opening theme. It\u2019s one of the styles of music that I love, but what got me was how unexpected it was. I had known beforehand that this was based on a shoujo manga, so this opening surprised the hell out of me. Knowing there are major differences in the manga, I may give that a shot someday. Otherwise, I don\u2019t plan on revisiting the anime.",

Some episodes didn't feel like they tied in with each other. I do think that the way they try to represent the theme of friendship wasn't the best. Defiantly could have worked on it a bit.\r\nI personally love the characters. I think that they are unique in their own ways. Yet I do see some resemblance from other anime characters. \r\nOverall, Servamp was a great anime in my opinion but thereis room for development.

I found an AMV of this anime. My first though was \"I have nothing else to watch right now, so what ever.\" Now, I finished the anime. It was nothing like I thought it was going to be. I gave it a 10/10 because of how much I enjoyed to anime, but I can't really tell how I feel about it in some parts.\r\nThe story was decent. I didn't really like how almost every character hada depressing backstory. By the fourth backstory I almost wanted to skip it completely because it was getting annoying. Servamp's plot was something some people might call \"mainstream\". Nothing really special stuck out for me there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good, and the battle scenes were enjoying to watch. That coming from someone who usually tries to find a romance/mystery anime. The thing that REALLY took my by surprise was the music. If you thought you were going to hear some classic cute moe anime opening, then you are dead wrong. You know what is moe? The ending. That ending was terrible. The opening was almost better. I do have to give them credit though. Not a lot of people would enjoy the screaming sound in your ear before you start watching an anime, so I guess they were very brave to choose that song.\\n\\n\r\nOh no, now I have to talk about the characters. I don't really have much to say about them. I don't think they were built well enough. Each character was either tsundere, dandere, or just really energetic.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime wasn't really that bad. I do admit there were times when I wanted to smash my head in a wall, because for the hundreth time I was hearing the word \"friend\". Other than that, I liked the plot and art, along with the amazing 'edge of your seat' battle scenes. Servamp was fun to watch, and I recommend it to those who like mystery and supernatural animes!",

            "content": "As a collector and reader of the manga of this series, I was really excited when the anime came out\u2026 but at this point, if I were to refer this to anyone I'd tell them to read the manga first. I feel like the adaptation went well but not as well as it could have went. \r\nFor the story, as it happens in lots of adaptations of any manga, the sequence of the plot changes a little and that can be quite a put-off. Some of the original story isn't even adapted and others are either short or expanded. It feels like episode to episode,your opinion of the show itself changes\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe art and effects are still very well done, like the fight scenes. The \\n\r\nmangaka's original style, like the thick and rough paint brush strokes for the \"dramatic\" effects, are incorporated in a good way. The animation is very clear, also. I'd say what I didn't wnjoy was the stop-start of character motion in comedy scenes\u2026I feel like there wasn't enough done on top of that to give the watcher the notion that it even was a comedy scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe bgm could have been a little better. Where it was good, it did well to bring the moment to life I'd say. The theme songs help set the mood for the show in a positive way-- like the OLDCODEX op gives off the dark and action-ish feel and the cv ending brings more life to the characters. (I really enjoyed the ed because it was cute lol) \\n\\n\r\nThe cv's do a very good job of voicing the characters\u2026I've had plenty of moments where a character appeared and I was like \"wow, that's exactly what I thought he'd sound like!!!\" As far as development goes, some characters are focused on more than others so it feels like you know them more (example Kuro and Mahiru) and everyone else just kinda fits into their roles and that's it :( because their backgrounds aren't adapted much at all. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I do enjoy the adaptation as much as I do the manga. I did notice the friendship theme and it's strong prevalence in the plot\u2026which isn't bad but it does make up a large theme of the series itself\u2026take it out and it would be completely different and would probably have a more mature feel to it. The action is good and the dramatic scenes could've used a little more work I believe. \"Yes!! More dark shoujo is needed in this world!\" is what I thought when I first started to enjoy the series (and is true after all). It's all guys (yessss) pretty much so for shoujo/reverse harem fans it isn't very hard to find a bias or two. No romance either (that was a plus for me) so it doesn't interfere with the plot. I do feel the anime was a little underrated but there are different types of watchers out there, no? \\n\r\n ~~~and there goes review number 2.",

Just the fact that it was actually published in a Josei magazine baffles me. Who thought it was a good idea?\r\n________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 2/10\r\n What do you get when you add 'figthing for my freinds!!!1!!!' with vampires with a survival game? The answer is a clusterfuck of characters and battles with lame motivations who's names you can't remember due to horribly executed master/servant relationships. The plot is very hard to follow at points, but from what I did follow, it wasn't that good to begin with. The conclusion,to top it off, is satisfying. Like, very satisfying. Almost made me wish that the series  actually had something good earlier so I could've gotten at least a bit of enjoyment out of it.\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n Servamp's art and animation just scream 'bland'.  The animation seems to avoid any difficult  character positions which looks weird at some parts. The art is colorful at the very least, but still feels dried up almost, like it sat in the sun for too long.\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n For the most part, the voice acting, though half of them were annoying, were unique, and it helped the terrible characters become a little more distinguishable. As for the rest of it... well if you like heavy metal blaring in your ears, this is for you.\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 2/10\\n\\n\r\n The characters are frustrating to me. Mostly, because even if they are all VERY sexualized towards a female audience, some of them still look pretty cool! Kuro especially, and that lobster guy. Oh, and the piano kid. I don't have a reason to look up their names; the show didn't give me one. Despite some having alluring designs, they're motivations are so lame, it's hard not to laugh as they yell the way only anime characters can.\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nTL;DR: 3/10\\n\\n\r\n+Satisfying ending\\n\r\n+Some good character design\\n\r\n-Everything else\\n\\n\r\n Servamp isn't worth your time, honestly. Even if you are looking for an anime exactly like this, Owari no Seraph outclasses it in every way. And THAT should say something.",

            "content": "There's no denying that Servamp has some of the usual things that you expect from anything involving vampires like the vampires increased regeneration, strength, etc.   I think it was a new idea though to have them bonded to humans, called their eves, and form a pair.  Forming a pair made them a little more fragile, but they also got another person to help them and all the pairs shown worked well on their own as well as with other servamp and eve pairs.  \r\nI liked Tsubaki's development, Kuro's, and Greed's; I also enjoyed how Mahiru and the other eves grew too.The action was also  a huge plus for the show, even though it could always be better.  Despite how much I enjoyed the show, I think there was too many plot twists.  Every-time that they carried out one plan, another huge huge event or just sometime they didn't account for would take place.  I'll still give this an 8/10 because it was really enjoyable, the theme song was really good and added to the mood, and the characters were all lovable if you like their personalities.  If you think, the things I mentioned sound interesting, watch it, if not, avoid it.",

            "content": "For once I actually think I\u2019m capable of giving an opinion on an anime that goes beyond \u201cyeah, I liked it,\u201d so I\u2019m actually going to try my hand at making a review. TL;DR at the end.\r\nFor starters:\r\nServamp was nice. Genuinely liked it. Characters were fun and unique, both design-wise and personality-wise, and I got attached to most of them pretty quickly. Animation style was pretty and the concept was really interesting. Would I watch it again? Yeah definitely. It was entertaining and looking past its flaws I, again, genuinely liked the show.\r\nHowever, I do actually have something to criticize.\r\nNow, I\u2019m not usually the kindof person who\u2019d be able to take any kind of issue  with the more technical aspects of a show, but the entire time I was watching Servamp I kept thinking about how fast paced the show seemed to be. It felt like it was rushing through its own story. It had a lot of characters to get into and a lot to accomplish in twelve episodes and with the poor way it was all laid out it just didn\u2019t work well. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of the pacing it just seemed to gloss over a lot of important details and only briefly mentioned things it should have probably talked about. There are so many things that get mentioned and seem important only to never be talked about or seen again. Some characters that you think are going to get a decent amount of attention or be kind of relevant or important might only get one or two major scenes. Hell, two of the seven deadly sins are only seen in flashbacks. You don\u2019t actually get to meet them. Since when does a show about the seven deadly sins not formally introduce all seven sins?\\n\\n\r\nNow some of those things I will admit could have been cast aside to put in a potential second season. It\u2019s not the best way to go about storytelling, but it is definitely a possibility. However, as it has been three years without a second season and it\u2019s safe to say we probably won\u2019t be getting one, it just makes the show seem messy and unfocused. And I haven\u2019t seen the movie yet, seeing as the only way I seem to be able to do so is by buying the DVD and my DVD player is currently broken, but from the title and simple synopsis it does seem like it goes more in depth with at least one character (but hopefully two) whose relationship with his family and backstory are brushed off. Although I\u2019m very glad that looks to be the direction they went in and I really hope I can see it for myself soon, they made that backstory seem like a major part of his character but then proceeded to make you wait two years to see it in the movie. It wasn\u2019t like it was one of those things where they give you a nod to the character\u2019s past, maybe give you a little information on it in passing, and give you a movie on it later- they made sure you knew something big was up with it but didn\u2019t actually give you anything until the movie. Although, I suppose it is a good way to get people interested in the movie.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s the last episode. I don\u2019t know how I can really explain it without spoiling anything but essentially it just... ends. The ending itself is kind of sudden, for lack of a better way of saying so and an inability to go in depth with it. There\u2019s a character you\u2019re left wondering what the hell happened to, but since the main goal has been accomplished you get one of those \u201cshow\u2019s over, here\u2019s everyone after the adventure\u201d montages and are sent on your way. The last episode or two is where you could really tell they had to cram more than they were capable of into twelve episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I do suggest you watch Servamp yourself, I suggest reading the manga more. The first thing I did when I finished the anime was check the manga out, because I really did love the concept and the characters and the story, and there was so much I felt like I wasn\u2019t being told. Now, at the time of writing this I\u2019m only just over four volumes into it, but I can safely say that the issue with the pacing and the glossing over things is, in fact, an issue with the anime, and not with the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nShow\u2019s good overall but paced quickly and brushes over a lot of things. Solve that by reading the manga. Last episode is eh. All in all, do recommend.",

            "content": "Normally I try to keep anime and manga reviews separate but in the case of this series I think the manga needs to be taken into account. I also want to make note that I am HUGELY particular when it comes to anything dealing with vampires so if I liked a vampire series there must be something good about it.\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this series. I adore all the characters and being some one that does yaoi shipping all the time I love that this series just hands you the material on a silver platter. This is another series that has a character for everyoneto fan over and the voice cast is very spot on as well. The story is also very unique in the idea that the vampires serve the humans they drink from and are bonded to them. It does have a slight black butler feel to it so I feel like fans of that series (which I am one of) would really enjoy that aspect of this show.\\n\r\nHowever, this show does have quite a few faults that can't be ignored but I feel like its import to say that most of these issues could be solved with a second season. I quickly went and found the manga to read and I realized that episode 9 of the anime is chapter 31 of the manga. I think what's happened is the anime team decided that rather than trying to properly introduce 14+ important characters in just 12 episodes they choice to pick out the story arches that focused mainly on the 2 main characters and probably intend to fill in the rest of the content later if the first season does well and gets green lighted for a season 2. I could see how the story arches could easily be told in a different order than they are told in the manga in order to make that possible so most issues should be fixed if a season 2 does happen.\\n\r\nWith that in mind i have two issues with this series. First is that virtually no questions get answered as to why the vampires powers work this way or even the details on exactly how their powers work or even larger picture questions \"like are these the only vampires in the world or are there others that don't work this way\". You are told in the manga that a lot of these things are a mystery even to the vampires themselves because they don't particularly like what they are and don't want to investigate it any further. My other issue is that the ending of this segment of the anime is super fast and doesn't explain at all how the issue actually got resolved. I haven't fully caught up with the manga yet but I suspect that the wrap up of the last story arch was happening pretty much at the same time as the anime was being produced and again the ending could always be better explained in the first episode of another season.\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed watching this series for the story theme and characters (and this has to be the funniest role i've ever heard chuck huber do). I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys things like black butler or even blue exorcist but keep an open mind to the potential it could have in the future or even read the manga as well.",

            "content": "Oh, I tell you what, this anime doesn't deserve the rating it has right now. It went way beyond my expectations. \r\nThe concept of this anime is endlessly interesting to me. Right away, the jumping off point for the plot of this anime was sure to be a success based on the information given to us about Servamps and their Eves. Add on top of that the wealth of interesting characters, and you've got the makings of an awesome anime. \r\nHere's where it went wrong: simplicity (no pun intended for those of you who have seen the anime). Servamp's potential was really strong, but itfell short when it came to expansion. For example, had the anime dug into the history of Servamps a bit more, it would've been a lot more enjoyable. You get the bare minimum that you need to understand the story, but there's so much lost information that would be really interesting to learn about.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, you'll see these bonds develop throughout the anime that don't have as much basis as they could have because the relationships lack development. It doesn't really cause the partnerships to feel forced or disingenuous, but it doesn't feel like the audience is missing a piece of development. That's not true of all the characters as one particular pairing had a really lovely backstory that supported their current relationship nicely. However, I would've liked for there to be just a bit more focus on the friendships in the anime since the overall theme of it hinges on friendship. \\n\\n\r\nBesides those things, this anime was tops. It was extremely enjoyable, and I really only came up with those criticisms after watching it and thinking about what issues there were. The characters were fun and alluring, the story was told in a very intriguing way, and I want more of it. I don't know if a new story is entirely necessary as it probably would've been better to have an expanded first season, but I want to watch these characters more. You're not gonna get deep and complex world-building from this anime, but I think you'll still have a great time watching it. If all else fails, the humor is perfect. Can't go wrong with a good laugh.",

            "content": "This review is made with those who have read some of the other reviews, but are still undecided, in mind.\r\nI decided to watch this anime since I remember reading the first couple of chapters of the manga a few years ago. While I have no idea how the manga progressed, considering this anime was only 12 episodes while the manga is still publishing, it's obviously not going to follow the manga to a tee; that being said, that doesn't mean it can't be great on its own. Unfortunately, while I find myself wanting to read the manga, it's because I want to know just howbadly the anime screwed things up.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nThe story premise is decent enough, but the progression in the anime was awful. There was one episode towards the end where a good chunk was the backstory of a character that did practically nothing for the plot; what was covered could have easily been summarized into two minutes of brief flashbacks (as opposed to the long ones) so the viewer could understand a few of the dynamics between this character and a few of the others. On the other hand, some of the most anticipated battles get...well, no screen time. And the ending of the series was pretty much the default ending for a few of the episodes, since apparently, the writers couldn't be bothered to create a special final line for the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art was interesting at times, but ultimately, nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nThe opening is heavy metal, so I'll admit I was biased towards it, not being a fan of that genre. I tried to listen the whole way through the first time but just couldn't bring myself to. The closing is pretty random for the series and a total contrast to the opening. While there is music throughout much of the series (courtesy of one of the characters), the music played often feels misplaced, making it even annoying. The sound of one of the characters (hint, the one who says \"happy birthday\") I felt was well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nThe main character Mahiru was made annoying; by that, I don't mean his character type (which is also annoying), but I mean he was literally made to be especially annoying even for his type. How many times do we have to be reminded about how he likes things \"simple\" (his definition of simple isn't the average)? Turns out quite often. Kuro, the other main character, is actually the only character I cared for in the whole anime by the end; kitty Kuro and his silly moments are actually some of the few highlights of the show for me. \\n\r\nBesides those two, we have the tsundere friend; the two extra friends who have almost no screen time outside of the first episode; the snobby rich kid; the \"hot\" guy who appears to be a lolicon (which none of the characters even comment on...); and featuring the villain who is psycho but with some \"sad\" backstory...actually, make that villains. That's not even all of them, but you get the idea. Granted, stereotypical character types can still be done well to where the characters don't feel recycled, but in this anime they aren't.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nThe best way to watch this is probably to binge-watch and finish it in a day or two; it retains some entertainment value at least since you keep anticipating those revelations and epic battle scenes, while not giving yourself enough time to get frustrated that they still haven't showed up, just to let all the disappointment and frustration sink in after you finished. I personally binge-watched, finished the series in two days, and looking back I don't want to think about how I would be feeling if I had watched this weekly as it was airing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm probably being generous, but there's a lot worse out there in my opinion. I can't compare this to the source of material (the manga), as much as I wish I could. I can only assume that they crammed as much as they could, based on what was published, to try to create a full series while making an alternative ending; an ending which, quite frankly, sucked. If you have free time, and have nothing better to watch, go ahead and watch Servamp. Otherwise, go ahead and watch the next series on your to-watch list.",

It's the first anime I have seen where they have used important scenes to make them as short as possible to let them run concurrently just like in the episode with C3. \r\nFor me it looks like they just want to bring everything in 12 episodes as fast as they can do.\r\nThe anime based onone big annoying problem called \"Friendship\". It may would become a little bit better if they had used 1 or 2 'friendship moments/sentence' what ever fewer.\\n\r\nThe characters are interesting but not really that good. We have 7+1 vampires and there Eve's and a few freaks from C3 and a strange Doctor, that's it.\\n\\n\r\n[I'm sorry if my english is not that good]\\n",

I thought what little humor it had was done well and the story was gripping enough to make me not drop the show. It was 'just' about gripping enough so don't expect an amazing story just expect to be entertained because this show definitely does that.\r\nNow onto the characters. We have Kuro, a vampire who can turn into a cat. Mahiro, a simple guy but quite unique. Sakoya(I think), who is his mate and other various characters. I really liked Kuro and wanted to learn about his backstoryfrom the get-go and I was supplied with it. The rest of the cast are ok and the only others which stand out are Lawless and Licht who are my fav side characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is really good. Possibly top 10 maybe. It's softcore-ish rock, compared to what i'm used to, and is really nice to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is awesome. Full 1080 with really nice visuals make the show have nice impact. Angles aren't One Piece crazy or anything but it's nice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really like it but there is one thing that bugged me and that is....\\n\\n\r\nThe ending. It's not explained. Not even to the point where it is a cliff-hanger I just didn't understand why x happened at the end of it. It was bs tbh.\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway thanks here is a too long:didn't read section\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr Really nice show I enjoyed it, sick op, sick visuals but a bad ending and not many remember able characters",

It didn't have any depth though. It was kinda clich\u00e9. MC gets some sort of special something and then tries to save the world. But the whole servamp concept makes up for it. BTW a servamp is a servant vampire if you didn't know that already. I liked the story, it was well written well. Except for the ending, just saying. \r\nArt and Sound:\r\nThe art and sound were not bad at all. But they weren'tamazing. The art was average, but not terrible. It was colorful and had some detail to it. And some scenes the art was AMAZING. For the sound, it didn't really stand out to me, but it fitted the show nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI personally loved the characters. Even the characters that don't have much screen time are still ok. I didn't really hate any of the characters. The bad guy, Tsubaki, insane. I mean insane! The MC, Mahiru, however was kinda generic. He's the character that will run into a battle head on, risk his life for a friend, you know that kind of character. My favorite characters by far would have to be Lawless and Licht. When they were first introduced I thought they would be my least favorite characters, I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Servamp. It had good fight scenes, good comedy, and a nice flowing story. But the ending did kinda suck.\\n\\n\r\nHope this helps :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "I just finished watching the last episode, I didn't really like it. I personally think the anime tried to fit what could've been 24 or 25 episodes into 12 episodes. This is because they didn't introduce a lot of the servamps and eves, didn't explain C3 thoroughly enough, and the storyline was kind of unorganized and all over the place. It was very anti-climatic and overall kind of confusing. I also think this anime had poor character development. \r\n~It's one of those anime with great potential, but poor set up (the way things played out wasn't very organized), but that'sjust my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n     The character design was amazing (visually) and they had cool and unique features/traits but they weren't developed deep enough. A lot of characters just showed up and had a mini background story, but to me that was kind of weak. The development (background info.) on the characters was merely just enough to make them relevant to the story line, rather then deep development that makes the character understandable. I understand that this was only 12 episodes, but I've seen anime with only 12 episodes that can perfectly develop characters.\\n\r\nIn addition to poor character development many of the characters showed up, like servamps and eves, but weren't developed at all. To me I thought it would be important to at least meet all the servamps, but only some were introduced.For example, the queen that Greed (Hyde) was infatuated with had more screen time then most of the servamps, and she was only used in a background story to 'develop' him. While Greed and Licht (the angel) were my favorite parring, I personally think they had better character development than Mahiru and Sloth/Kuro/Sleepy Ash (the main characters).\\n\\n\r\n     Another problem I had with the anime was it was a little confusing and kind of unorganized. There was a point in the story where there was a flashback about the Servamps and Kuro's history with his family. While it was a good idea to include the flashback into the plot, I personally think it should've been elaborated on more. It was a quick flashback that apparently was a big deal throughout the show. It seemed like something so small in the plot, but it affected the main characters in a way, that I think, shouldn't have been such a big deal. I saw it as something in the past, but it kept coming up as something that affected the relationships between multiple characters.\\n\\n\r\n     Adding on to my list of picky complaints, I think the goal/reasoning (for the anime) wasn't evident till the last episode, this anime's antagonist wasn't made a big deal (in my eyes), his appearance was minimal. The conclusion of the anime was based solely on stopping this antagonist, but I just thought he was a crazy man everyone need to keep an eye out for. In the end, the way the plot played out, it made it seemed like this anime didn't have a point.\\n\\n\r\n     As you can see character development and plot are kind of a big thing to me, and I know for some people it isn't and that's where people may disagree with me, but this is my two cents on everything ~.<\\n\\n",

            "content": "I am a bit of a new blogger and reviewer (though I have been into anime and other otaku-related things for quite some time now), so please excuse me if this review is not the best. I will attempt to keep it spoiler free. I will put a warning beforehand if I do include a spoiler.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story was good. Vampires are really nothing new to work with both in anime and in Hollywood and the like. I can't say the story was super new, exciting, and unique, because it really wasn't. Being unoriginal doesn't equate to the story being bad though. As I've said,it is a good story, and it was definitely enough to keep me watching. Basically, Mahiru is our main protagonist. He likes simplistic things, and hates troublesome things. He picked up a black cat who (not really a spoiler since this is in some synopses of this show) is a vampire. He names the cat/vampire Kuro. Together they join forces with other vampires to fight bad vampires. That is in VERY simple terms. I'm sure Mahiru would approve of my description. Don't let this cliche storyline stop you from enjoying the plot though. While it isn't exactly original overall, it does have its unique points.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was good! The character designs especially were very enjoyable. Who doesn't like watching attractive bishounen-type characters fight each other? If the rest of the art was as good as the characters, this score would have been a little higher. Of course, even the characters weren't worth 10/10 or anything like that. The art style isn't unique, it is just pleasing to the eyes is all. The backgrounds and scenery is my main complaint here. There are times the lighting seems a bit weird to me and makes the characters look almost puppet-like against the backdrop. All in all, I have no major complaints besides that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI really had no problem with the sound throughout the anime. I think all sound effects and background music were well-executed. Some people complain about the opening theme being a metal/screamo song instead of the usual jpop type of OP many anime have. I felt it was unusual and new, and probably the most unique thing about this anime. I also have a weak spot for metal anyways, so this appealed to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are either said to be very unoriginal and bland, or the polar opposite. I thought the characters were very well done. It isn't because they are super unique, but if you have any type of heart, then you will become attached to many characters in this anime. I am a sucker for sad backstories. If you are, too, then you will enjoy the characters of Servamp as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI guess I could say it was really enjoyable. I binge watched about half of it one night and finished it the next morning. Normally I'd binge watch it all in one night, so I cannot say my enjoyment exceeds an 8/10, but it is definitely worthy of that 8. I am also really looking forward to season 2 which is said to be coming out this year of 2017.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Servamp. Was it spectacular and the most amazing anime ever? No, not really. However, it was worth the watch. It is only 12 episodes, so it doesn't take much of your time. I would suggest to give it a chance if you like anime like Owari no Seraph for example. If you like bishounen vampires, overly \"anime\" type humor, cool fight scenes with cheesy character lines that are never let go, and memorable characters, then you'll enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI will be posting a more in-depth review on my new blog which is theotakutimesblog . wordpress . com\\n\r\nThe blog is currently still under editing but it will be up hopefully within the next couple of days.\\n\r\nThank you for reading!",

            "content": "I've currently watched all 4 episodes of this anime so far. Rating on those aired 4 episodes, i think the story is very interesting. This anime isn't focused on a tragedy or a romance anime, but it still made me shed tears near the end of the 4th episode. Therefore, for story i give it an 9. It meets my requirements and i genuinely enjoy animes that can make me emotionally unstable because it just shows how much attention i'm giving the anime.\r\nFor the art, it looks rather basic. Lol im kidding, i think the art is cute. Kuro's fashion makes me think moe, butuh that's not the point. The art is exceeds my average standards. Leading my rating for it, another 9.\\n\\n\r\nFor sound wise, i'm not sure if i enjoyed it too much. The voice actors were incredible however, as always. The opening did match the the of the anime so although the beat wasn't quite my taste, I did understand. Sound gets an 7.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the characters in the anime were the main part it was so interesting. Kuro's lazy personality really helped lighten the anime and made it easier for the watcher to consume. The story in general about vampires isn't realistic but the MC displays realistic human emotion which helps the person watching relate a little. The supporting characters made me feel like they were really needed to bring the story up as they did their job well. Sometimes in animes, the supporters don't do the job well which make watchers think that they're not needed in general. With these details included, this section scores yet another 9.\\n\\n\r\nFinally the enjoyment, this may just be personal because everyone has their own enjoyment level on different animes, but mine was a 10. This anime led me on with plot development and suspense. I couldn't wait for the next episode and when i realised i had finished watching all the currently aired ones, i was rather devastated.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime scores a whooping 9. I suggest you try out this anime if you have nothing better to do or you're looking for an anime to really make you excited.\\n\\n\r\nThis concludes my review.",

            "content": "I have seen plenty of Josei anime to the point I can surely say what makes it quite distinguishing from other genre is that most of the time, it consisting characters driven story and has high attention to the realism. Servamp caught my interest because it happens to fallen to be one of the genres and it ended up to be exceptional. Exceptional that it is so badly done that ends up being counterproductive.\r\nThe story of Servamp follows Mahiru... actually; the main story is pretty much covered in the synopsis, so there isn't much reason for me to regurgitate the same thing in different words.Long story short, Servamp is really something we\u2019ve seen hundreds of times before; ordinary high school boy meets weird stuff (in this case black cats) and gets caught in a live or die situation with all convenient we\u2019ve come to expect of such story. \\n\\n\r\nNow, in all respect there\u2019s nothing wrong with a premise that is lack of originality. But servamp just feel\u2026. quite empty. The plot is just something you encounter in battle shounen series; if you\u2019re looking for in-depth plot then look further because the show doesn\u2019t had any. Everything in the plot is pretty clear black and white, the bad guy is obvious and the good guy is always on the side good guys. The first few episodes are generally geared towards comedy with little real progression. The actual comedy isn't too bad and some moments are fairly funny, but hit or miss jokes aren't enough to make something entertaining. The series then shifts to more of a battle shounen with action, however, the action isn\u2019t that much interesting and feels rushed because most of the time it ended with always ends with one slash. I\u2019d also like to mention the tone is pretty I don\u2019t know\u2026 not appropriate? because the show explained that the bad vampires is a creature that kills human, yet everything is feel so mundane and light, there no sense of urgency; it is as if the show doesn\u2019t take the whole the matters seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters well... we get to see the major protagonist and the major villain gets a backstory (which is all sad/ tragic story by the way) but somehow it wasn\u2019t full enough to make us sympathize with them. The supporting is even worse, because they don\u2019t even have time due to the short length. One of the prime example is Misono, on which his dreams is to protect people, but it never be explained why he do so considering he looks like some rich boy who doesn\u2019t care with anyone.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, due to the short length, many of the questions raised are left unanswered, coupled with an unsatisfying conclusion (not that it concludes anything), which ends just as it seems the real story is about to begin; it told the viewers there are seven servamp based of seven sins yet at the end of the series there are only five present and the ending was cop out and feels like Disney\u2019s ending. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is the art, which is certainly Servamp best area. But even then, it is not above series in at least 2 years back. There are a wide range of colors used for all of the characters, which is nice but it the background are just present I guess. The animation quality is decent. There are a few instances where they turn it up a notch, but this is mostly for action scenes, which rarely last more than two minutes. all in all it is competent to today standard.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was okay. The opening were all right and suited the series but were also pretty generic themes. The opening theme was slightly better as it set up the episodes quite well, and the visuals associated with it were actually relevant to the story of the anime. The rest of the soundtrack, while not being anything noteworthy, matched the mood of the scenes and worded well overall. However, I found the ED to be terrible, but that\u2019s more like luxury than actual criticism.\\n\\n\r\nServamp is a pretty underwhelming action/comedy series The early couple of episodes maybe mildly entertaining, but as a whole the series is quite frustrating, due to a lack of any real closure. We\u2019re introduced to an extensive cast, but many of them lacked a decent back story. Mahiru, being the main character, wasn't particularly interesting, but the side characters were, even if most were given very little time to shine. It's in the middle episodes, where it feels very rushed, that most of the enjoyment is lost. The production values are solid, but nothing to blow anyone away. I would also like to mention, that if you are expecting to see traditional vampires, then you will be generally disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nA forgotten series and probably one of few Josei series that I personally found bad.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The top rated review for this being a '3' seems very exaggerated. An anime that is rated a '3' lacks not only in story, but also art, sound and character. Here's why that is not true:\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThis is a setting that many have seen before. Normal High School student is met with the supernatural and pulled into a whole different world. So far, it doesn't seem like there is anything too amazing about it. However, I have not yet encountered a story in which said supernatural creature is literally THE most lazy person in the show, which often helps loosen the 'deep' mood that thestory is going for with an amusing comment about how he'd rather take a nap than do anything 'bothersome'.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation is great, and the character design is a very favorite of mine. Bright colors, distinctive character designs so that you don't get confused about who is who - nothing to complain about here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI really love the opening by Oldcodex that suits the anime's darker theme, but also the ending that gives you a more upbeat and happy-go-lucky feeling if there has been a particularly 'dark' episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe main character is your everyday hero who wants to protect his friends and do everything right, which comes across as a bit generic at times. What really pulled me in was Kuro, the second main character, who (while being one of the laziest people on Earth) still manages to be powerful when needed, and also funny at times.\\n\\n\r\nA few episodes in is when the character development of Kuro starts to happen, when you start getting a deeper look into what has happened in his past.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI really cannot say I disliked watching any of these episodes. I'm always looking forward to the next one, and can't say that I felt like I wasted time with any of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIf you're someone who enjoys an anime with a pretty art style and bright colors, an anime that is somehow 'deep' but still manages to bring in funny and amusing scenes (sometimes when you least expect it), then I highly recommend this to you.",

            "content": "At first I just brush off this anime like those typical shounen, blah, plain MC ect. But somewhere through the 3rd and 4th episode, Mahiru grew on me. Not because he is anything special but the way he thinks. I can't deny that Mahiru's words are gonna stick with me the rest of my life. No matter when or where, there is always people hoping that 'someone' would come and because that 'someone' would definitely appear, the world keeps going. It isn't gonna be just him or just Kuro but it will be them.\r\nIf it's Kuro's problem, Mahiru has to be there, there isn't anythingto be faced alone. The problem might be Kuro's but Mahiru is his eve, his partner and his 'reason'. (as Mikuni had said) And seriously, despite everything, do you guys really want this to be 'oh I stab the antagonist, he ded, the end' is that kind of ending what you want? I think the ending was quite nice and peaceful and it wasn't unpleasant. It was a nice change. I don't need to see blood flying everywhere and people dying to call it a GREAT VICTORY! =_=\\n\\n\r\nLicht, Lawless, Kuro, Mahiru, Tsubaki and Sakuya are really interesting characters and even though the anime did not best in showing off characters such as the Pride pair and Lust pair, C3 as such, it did made some great show out of the more standing out ones. I enjoy the Greed pair the most (no surprise)\\n\\n\r\nI guess one of the reason I liked this anime is because there are a lot of angst going on in some anime now *COUGHDANGANRONPACOUGH* and not only that, because people now a-days just keeps spamming horror/angst/negative emotions. I really like how this anime turns out despite it's various flaw.",

If that\u2019s the case, then \u201cServamp\u201d is right up your ally.\r\nTo make things clear, I do not mind the ideas the show has to offer. I found the concept of Servamps and Eves to be quite interesting. The problem I had with it was how everything was presented. Each episode gave us new subplots after another where eventually we have a bunch of things happening at the same time with almost no conclusion. It then makes me question what the main plotis because when something new happens, that suddenly takes priority. By the time the series finished, many things were left discarded and unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the plot, the characters never go anywhere in terms of personality. They just appear and decide to be involved in the conflict like it was nothing. The main characters have zero presence and don\u2019t even feel like main characters. I had a hard time figuring out who the actual antagonist was or if there even was one. It\u2019s not an exaggeration when I say that we get two of more characters introduced each episode. We\u2019re overwhelmed with all of these people who have little to no presence. There is one thing I would like to mention. Each of the Servamps represent one of the seven deadly sins, and two of them are disregarded save for a flashback scene way later into the show. It was to my surprise that these two had appeared within five chapters of the manga, which baffles me because I don\u2019t know why that choice was made.\\n\\n\r\nThe only positive thing I can say about it is the animation. It\u2019s actually not that bad. The character designs were unique and each episode was often consistent. The action sequences weren\u2019t terrible, but still a bit uninteresting. I did like it when the style changed like when a Servamp was using its powers or we were inside their minds.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it had some good ideas and animation, \u201cServamp\u201d is still pretty boring with nothing to it. If I may be completely honest, the only thing that I truly got out of the show was the opening theme. It\u2019s one of the styles of music that I love, but what got me was how unexpected it was. I had known beforehand that this was based on a shoujo manga, so this opening surprised the hell out of me. Knowing there are major differences in the manga, I may give that a shot someday. Otherwise, I don\u2019t plan on revisiting the anime.",

I found an AMV of this anime. My first though was \"I have nothing else to watch right now, so what ever.\" Now, I finished the anime. It was nothing like I thought it was going to be. I gave it a 10/10 because of how much I enjoyed to anime, but I can't really tell how I feel about it in some parts.\r\nThe story was decent. I didn't really like how almost every character hada depressing backstory. By the fourth backstory I almost wanted to skip it completely because it was getting annoying. Servamp's plot was something some people might call \"mainstream\". Nothing really special stuck out for me there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good, and the battle scenes were enjoying to watch. That coming from someone who usually tries to find a romance/mystery anime. The thing that REALLY took my by surprise was the music. If you thought you were going to hear some classic cute moe anime opening, then you are dead wrong. You know what is moe? The ending. That ending was terrible. The opening was almost better. I do have to give them credit though. Not a lot of people would enjoy the screaming sound in your ear before you start watching an anime, so I guess they were very brave to choose that song.\\n\\n\r\nOh no, now I have to talk about the characters. I don't really have much to say about them. I don't think they were built well enough. Each character was either tsundere, dandere, or just really energetic.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime wasn't really that bad. I do admit there were times when I wanted to smash my head in a wall, because for the hundreth time I was hearing the word \"friend\". Other than that, I liked the plot and art, along with the amazing 'edge of your seat' battle scenes. Servamp was fun to watch, and I recommend it to those who like mystery and supernatural animes!",

I feel like the adaptation went well but not as well as it could have went. \r\nFor the story, as it happens in lots of adaptations of any manga, the sequence of the plot changes a little and that can be quite a put-off. Some of the original story isn't even adapted and others are either short or expanded. It feels like episode to episode,your opinion of the show itself changes\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe art and effects are still very well done, like the fight scenes. The \\n\r\nmangaka's original style, like the thick and rough paint brush strokes for the \"dramatic\" effects, are incorporated in a good way. The animation is very clear, also. I'd say what I didn't wnjoy was the stop-start of character motion in comedy scenes\u2026I feel like there wasn't enough done on top of that to give the watcher the notion that it even was a comedy scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe bgm could have been a little better. Where it was good, it did well to bring the moment to life I'd say. The theme songs help set the mood for the show in a positive way-- like the OLDCODEX op gives off the dark and action-ish feel and the cv ending brings more life to the characters. (I really enjoyed the ed because it was cute lol) \\n\\n\r\nThe cv's do a very good job of voicing the characters\u2026I've had plenty of moments where a character appeared and I was like \"wow, that's exactly what I thought he'd sound like!!!\" As far as development goes, some characters are focused on more than others so it feels like you know them more (example Kuro and Mahiru) and everyone else just kinda fits into their roles and that's it :( because their backgrounds aren't adapted much at all. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I do enjoy the adaptation as much as I do the manga. I did notice the friendship theme and it's strong prevalence in the plot\u2026which isn't bad but it does make up a large theme of the series itself\u2026take it out and it would be completely different and would probably have a more mature feel to it. The action is good and the dramatic scenes could've used a little more work I believe. \"Yes!! More dark shoujo is needed in this world!\" is what I thought when I first started to enjoy the series (and is true after all). It's all guys (yessss) pretty much so for shoujo/reverse harem fans it isn't very hard to find a bias or two. No romance either (that was a plus for me) so it doesn't interfere with the plot. I do feel the anime was a little underrated but there are different types of watchers out there, no? \\n\r\n ~~~and there goes review number 2.",

The answer is a clusterfuck of characters and battles with lame motivations who's names you can't remember due to horribly executed master/servant relationships. The plot is very hard to follow at points, but from what I did follow, it wasn't that good to begin with. The conclusion,to top it off, is satisfying. Like, very satisfying. Almost made me wish that the series  actually had something good earlier so I could've gotten at least a bit of enjoyment out of it.\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n Servamp's art and animation just scream 'bland'.  The animation seems to avoid any difficult  character positions which looks weird at some parts. The art is colorful at the very least, but still feels dried up almost, like it sat in the sun for too long.\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n For the most part, the voice acting, though half of them were annoying, were unique, and it helped the terrible characters become a little more distinguishable. As for the rest of it... well if you like heavy metal blaring in your ears, this is for you.\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 2/10\\n\\n\r\n The characters are frustrating to me. Mostly, because even if they are all VERY sexualized towards a female audience, some of them still look pretty cool! Kuro especially, and that lobster guy. Oh, and the piano kid. I don't have a reason to look up their names; the show didn't give me one. Despite some having alluring designs, they're motivations are so lame, it's hard not to laugh as they yell the way only anime characters can.\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nTL;DR: 3/10\\n\\n\r\n+Satisfying ending\\n\r\n+Some good character design\\n\r\n-Everything else\\n\\n\r\n Servamp isn't worth your time, honestly. Even if you are looking for an anime exactly like this, Owari no Seraph outclasses it in every way. And THAT should say something.",

            "content": "There's no denying that Servamp has some of the usual things that you expect from anything involving vampires like the vampires increased regeneration, strength, etc.   I think it was a new idea though to have them bonded to humans, called their eves, and form a pair.  Forming a pair made them a little more fragile, but they also got another person to help them and all the pairs shown worked well on their own as well as with other servamp and eve pairs.  \r\nI liked Tsubaki's development, Kuro's, and Greed's; I also enjoyed how Mahiru and the other eves grew too.The action was also  a huge plus for the show, even though it could always be better.  Despite how much I enjoyed the show, I think there was too many plot twists.  Every-time that they carried out one plan, another huge huge event or just sometime they didn't account for would take place.  I'll still give this an 8/10 because it was really enjoyable, the theme song was really good and added to the mood, and the characters were all lovable if you like their personalities.  If you think, the things I mentioned sound interesting, watch it, if not, avoid it.",

            "content": "For once I actually think I\u2019m capable of giving an opinion on an anime that goes beyond \u201cyeah, I liked it,\u201d so I\u2019m actually going to try my hand at making a review. TL;DR at the end.\r\nFor starters:\r\nServamp was nice. Genuinely liked it. Characters were fun and unique, both design-wise and personality-wise, and I got attached to most of them pretty quickly. Animation style was pretty and the concept was really interesting. Would I watch it again? Yeah definitely. It was entertaining and looking past its flaws I, again, genuinely liked the show.\r\nHowever, I do actually have something to criticize.\r\nNow, I\u2019m not usually the kindof person who\u2019d be able to take any kind of issue  with the more technical aspects of a show, but the entire time I was watching Servamp I kept thinking about how fast paced the show seemed to be. It felt like it was rushing through its own story. It had a lot of characters to get into and a lot to accomplish in twelve episodes and with the poor way it was all laid out it just didn\u2019t work well. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of the pacing it just seemed to gloss over a lot of important details and only briefly mentioned things it should have probably talked about. There are so many things that get mentioned and seem important only to never be talked about or seen again. Some characters that you think are going to get a decent amount of attention or be kind of relevant or important might only get one or two major scenes. Hell, two of the seven deadly sins are only seen in flashbacks. You don\u2019t actually get to meet them. Since when does a show about the seven deadly sins not formally introduce all seven sins?\\n\\n\r\nNow some of those things I will admit could have been cast aside to put in a potential second season. It\u2019s not the best way to go about storytelling, but it is definitely a possibility. However, as it has been three years without a second season and it\u2019s safe to say we probably won\u2019t be getting one, it just makes the show seem messy and unfocused. And I haven\u2019t seen the movie yet, seeing as the only way I seem to be able to do so is by buying the DVD and my DVD player is currently broken, but from the title and simple synopsis it does seem like it goes more in depth with at least one character (but hopefully two) whose relationship with his family and backstory are brushed off. Although I\u2019m very glad that looks to be the direction they went in and I really hope I can see it for myself soon, they made that backstory seem like a major part of his character but then proceeded to make you wait two years to see it in the movie. It wasn\u2019t like it was one of those things where they give you a nod to the character\u2019s past, maybe give you a little information on it in passing, and give you a movie on it later- they made sure you knew something big was up with it but didn\u2019t actually give you anything until the movie. Although, I suppose it is a good way to get people interested in the movie.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s the last episode. I don\u2019t know how I can really explain it without spoiling anything but essentially it just... ends. The ending itself is kind of sudden, for lack of a better way of saying so and an inability to go in depth with it. There\u2019s a character you\u2019re left wondering what the hell happened to, but since the main goal has been accomplished you get one of those \u201cshow\u2019s over, here\u2019s everyone after the adventure\u201d montages and are sent on your way. The last episode or two is where you could really tell they had to cram more than they were capable of into twelve episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I do suggest you watch Servamp yourself, I suggest reading the manga more. The first thing I did when I finished the anime was check the manga out, because I really did love the concept and the characters and the story, and there was so much I felt like I wasn\u2019t being told. Now, at the time of writing this I\u2019m only just over four volumes into it, but I can safely say that the issue with the pacing and the glossing over things is, in fact, an issue with the anime, and not with the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nShow\u2019s good overall but paced quickly and brushes over a lot of things. Solve that by reading the manga. Last episode is eh. All in all, do recommend.",

            "content": "Normally I try to keep anime and manga reviews separate but in the case of this series I think the manga needs to be taken into account. I also want to make note that I am HUGELY particular when it comes to anything dealing with vampires so if I liked a vampire series there must be something good about it.\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this series. I adore all the characters and being some one that does yaoi shipping all the time I love that this series just hands you the material on a silver platter. This is another series that has a character for everyoneto fan over and the voice cast is very spot on as well. The story is also very unique in the idea that the vampires serve the humans they drink from and are bonded to them. It does have a slight black butler feel to it so I feel like fans of that series (which I am one of) would really enjoy that aspect of this show.\\n\r\nHowever, this show does have quite a few faults that can't be ignored but I feel like its import to say that most of these issues could be solved with a second season. I quickly went and found the manga to read and I realized that episode 9 of the anime is chapter 31 of the manga. I think what's happened is the anime team decided that rather than trying to properly introduce 14+ important characters in just 12 episodes they choice to pick out the story arches that focused mainly on the 2 main characters and probably intend to fill in the rest of the content later if the first season does well and gets green lighted for a season 2. I could see how the story arches could easily be told in a different order than they are told in the manga in order to make that possible so most issues should be fixed if a season 2 does happen.\\n\r\nWith that in mind i have two issues with this series. First is that virtually no questions get answered as to why the vampires powers work this way or even the details on exactly how their powers work or even larger picture questions \"like are these the only vampires in the world or are there others that don't work this way\". You are told in the manga that a lot of these things are a mystery even to the vampires themselves because they don't particularly like what they are and don't want to investigate it any further. My other issue is that the ending of this segment of the anime is super fast and doesn't explain at all how the issue actually got resolved. I haven't fully caught up with the manga yet but I suspect that the wrap up of the last story arch was happening pretty much at the same time as the anime was being produced and again the ending could always be better explained in the first episode of another season.\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed watching this series for the story theme and characters (and this has to be the funniest role i've ever heard chuck huber do). I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys things like black butler or even blue exorcist but keep an open mind to the potential it could have in the future or even read the manga as well.",

            "content": "Oh, I tell you what, this anime doesn't deserve the rating it has right now. It went way beyond my expectations. \r\nThe concept of this anime is endlessly interesting to me. Right away, the jumping off point for the plot of this anime was sure to be a success based on the information given to us about Servamps and their Eves. Add on top of that the wealth of interesting characters, and you've got the makings of an awesome anime. \r\nHere's where it went wrong: simplicity (no pun intended for those of you who have seen the anime). Servamp's potential was really strong, but itfell short when it came to expansion. For example, had the anime dug into the history of Servamps a bit more, it would've been a lot more enjoyable. You get the bare minimum that you need to understand the story, but there's so much lost information that would be really interesting to learn about.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, you'll see these bonds develop throughout the anime that don't have as much basis as they could have because the relationships lack development. It doesn't really cause the partnerships to feel forced or disingenuous, but it doesn't feel like the audience is missing a piece of development. That's not true of all the characters as one particular pairing had a really lovely backstory that supported their current relationship nicely. However, I would've liked for there to be just a bit more focus on the friendships in the anime since the overall theme of it hinges on friendship. \\n\\n\r\nBesides those things, this anime was tops. It was extremely enjoyable, and I really only came up with those criticisms after watching it and thinking about what issues there were. The characters were fun and alluring, the story was told in a very intriguing way, and I want more of it. I don't know if a new story is entirely necessary as it probably would've been better to have an expanded first season, but I want to watch these characters more. You're not gonna get deep and complex world-building from this anime, but I think you'll still have a great time watching it. If all else fails, the humor is perfect. Can't go wrong with a good laugh.",

            "content": "This review is made with those who have read some of the other reviews, but are still undecided, in mind.\r\nI decided to watch this anime since I remember reading the first couple of chapters of the manga a few years ago. While I have no idea how the manga progressed, considering this anime was only 12 episodes while the manga is still publishing, it's obviously not going to follow the manga to a tee; that being said, that doesn't mean it can't be great on its own. Unfortunately, while I find myself wanting to read the manga, it's because I want to know just howbadly the anime screwed things up.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nThe story premise is decent enough, but the progression in the anime was awful. There was one episode towards the end where a good chunk was the backstory of a character that did practically nothing for the plot; what was covered could have easily been summarized into two minutes of brief flashbacks (as opposed to the long ones) so the viewer could understand a few of the dynamics between this character and a few of the others. On the other hand, some of the most anticipated battles get...well, no screen time. And the ending of the series was pretty much the default ending for a few of the episodes, since apparently, the writers couldn't be bothered to create a special final line for the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art was interesting at times, but ultimately, nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nThe opening is heavy metal, so I'll admit I was biased towards it, not being a fan of that genre. I tried to listen the whole way through the first time but just couldn't bring myself to. The closing is pretty random for the series and a total contrast to the opening. While there is music throughout much of the series (courtesy of one of the characters), the music played often feels misplaced, making it even annoying. The sound of one of the characters (hint, the one who says \"happy birthday\") I felt was well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nThe main character Mahiru was made annoying; by that, I don't mean his character type (which is also annoying), but I mean he was literally made to be especially annoying even for his type. How many times do we have to be reminded about how he likes things \"simple\" (his definition of simple isn't the average)? Turns out quite often. Kuro, the other main character, is actually the only character I cared for in the whole anime by the end; kitty Kuro and his silly moments are actually some of the few highlights of the show for me. \\n\r\nBesides those two, we have the tsundere friend; the two extra friends who have almost no screen time outside of the first episode; the snobby rich kid; the \"hot\" guy who appears to be a lolicon (which none of the characters even comment on...); and featuring the villain who is psycho but with some \"sad\" backstory...actually, make that villains. That's not even all of them, but you get the idea. Granted, stereotypical character types can still be done well to where the characters don't feel recycled, but in this anime they aren't.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nThe best way to watch this is probably to binge-watch and finish it in a day or two; it retains some entertainment value at least since you keep anticipating those revelations and epic battle scenes, while not giving yourself enough time to get frustrated that they still haven't showed up, just to let all the disappointment and frustration sink in after you finished. I personally binge-watched, finished the series in two days, and looking back I don't want to think about how I would be feeling if I had watched this weekly as it was airing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm probably being generous, but there's a lot worse out there in my opinion. I can't compare this to the source of material (the manga), as much as I wish I could. I can only assume that they crammed as much as they could, based on what was published, to try to create a full series while making an alternative ending; an ending which, quite frankly, sucked. If you have free time, and have nothing better to watch, go ahead and watch Servamp. Otherwise, go ahead and watch the next series on your to-watch list.",

I thought what little humor it had was done well and the story was gripping enough to make me not drop the show. It was 'just' about gripping enough so don't expect an amazing story just expect to be entertained because this show definitely does that.\r\nNow onto the characters. We have Kuro, a vampire who can turn into a cat. Mahiro, a simple guy but quite unique. Sakoya(I think), who is his mate and other various characters. I really liked Kuro and wanted to learn about his backstoryfrom the get-go and I was supplied with it. The rest of the cast are ok and the only others which stand out are Lawless and Licht who are my fav side characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is really good. Possibly top 10 maybe. It's softcore-ish rock, compared to what i'm used to, and is really nice to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is awesome. Full 1080 with really nice visuals make the show have nice impact. Angles aren't One Piece crazy or anything but it's nice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really like it but there is one thing that bugged me and that is....\\n\\n\r\nThe ending. It's not explained. Not even to the point where it is a cliff-hanger I just didn't understand why x happened at the end of it. It was bs tbh.\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway thanks here is a too long:didn't read section\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr Really nice show I enjoyed it, sick op, sick visuals but a bad ending and not many remember able characters",

It didn't have any depth though. It was kinda clich\u00e9. MC gets some sort of special something and then tries to save the world. But the whole servamp concept makes up for it. BTW a servamp is a servant vampire if you didn't know that already. I liked the story, it was well written well. Except for the ending, just saying. \r\nArt and Sound:\r\nThe art and sound were not bad at all. But they weren'tamazing. The art was average, but not terrible. It was colorful and had some detail to it. And some scenes the art was AMAZING. For the sound, it didn't really stand out to me, but it fitted the show nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI personally loved the characters. Even the characters that don't have much screen time are still ok. I didn't really hate any of the characters. The bad guy, Tsubaki, insane. I mean insane! The MC, Mahiru, however was kinda generic. He's the character that will run into a battle head on, risk his life for a friend, you know that kind of character. My favorite characters by far would have to be Lawless and Licht. When they were first introduced I thought they would be my least favorite characters, I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Servamp. It had good fight scenes, good comedy, and a nice flowing story. But the ending did kinda suck.\\n\\n\r\nHope this helps :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "I just finished watching the last episode, I didn't really like it. I personally think the anime tried to fit what could've been 24 or 25 episodes into 12 episodes. This is because they didn't introduce a lot of the servamps and eves, didn't explain C3 thoroughly enough, and the storyline was kind of unorganized and all over the place. It was very anti-climatic and overall kind of confusing. I also think this anime had poor character development. \r\n~It's one of those anime with great potential, but poor set up (the way things played out wasn't very organized), but that'sjust my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n     The character design was amazing (visually) and they had cool and unique features/traits but they weren't developed deep enough. A lot of characters just showed up and had a mini background story, but to me that was kind of weak. The development (background info.) on the characters was merely just enough to make them relevant to the story line, rather then deep development that makes the character understandable. I understand that this was only 12 episodes, but I've seen anime with only 12 episodes that can perfectly develop characters.\\n\r\nIn addition to poor character development many of the characters showed up, like servamps and eves, but weren't developed at all. To me I thought it would be important to at least meet all the servamps, but only some were introduced.For example, the queen that Greed (Hyde) was infatuated with had more screen time then most of the servamps, and she was only used in a background story to 'develop' him. While Greed and Licht (the angel) were my favorite parring, I personally think they had better character development than Mahiru and Sloth/Kuro/Sleepy Ash (the main characters).\\n\\n\r\n     Another problem I had with the anime was it was a little confusing and kind of unorganized. There was a point in the story where there was a flashback about the Servamps and Kuro's history with his family. While it was a good idea to include the flashback into the plot, I personally think it should've been elaborated on more. It was a quick flashback that apparently was a big deal throughout the show. It seemed like something so small in the plot, but it affected the main characters in a way, that I think, shouldn't have been such a big deal. I saw it as something in the past, but it kept coming up as something that affected the relationships between multiple characters.\\n\\n\r\n     Adding on to my list of picky complaints, I think the goal/reasoning (for the anime) wasn't evident till the last episode, this anime's antagonist wasn't made a big deal (in my eyes), his appearance was minimal. The conclusion of the anime was based solely on stopping this antagonist, but I just thought he was a crazy man everyone need to keep an eye out for. In the end, the way the plot played out, it made it seemed like this anime didn't have a point.\\n\\n\r\n     As you can see character development and plot are kind of a big thing to me, and I know for some people it isn't and that's where people may disagree with me, but this is my two cents on everything ~.<\\n\\n",

            "content": "I am a bit of a new blogger and reviewer (though I have been into anime and other otaku-related things for quite some time now), so please excuse me if this review is not the best. I will attempt to keep it spoiler free. I will put a warning beforehand if I do include a spoiler.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story was good. Vampires are really nothing new to work with both in anime and in Hollywood and the like. I can't say the story was super new, exciting, and unique, because it really wasn't. Being unoriginal doesn't equate to the story being bad though. As I've said,it is a good story, and it was definitely enough to keep me watching. Basically, Mahiru is our main protagonist. He likes simplistic things, and hates troublesome things. He picked up a black cat who (not really a spoiler since this is in some synopses of this show) is a vampire. He names the cat/vampire Kuro. Together they join forces with other vampires to fight bad vampires. That is in VERY simple terms. I'm sure Mahiru would approve of my description. Don't let this cliche storyline stop you from enjoying the plot though. While it isn't exactly original overall, it does have its unique points.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was good! The character designs especially were very enjoyable. Who doesn't like watching attractive bishounen-type characters fight each other? If the rest of the art was as good as the characters, this score would have been a little higher. Of course, even the characters weren't worth 10/10 or anything like that. The art style isn't unique, it is just pleasing to the eyes is all. The backgrounds and scenery is my main complaint here. There are times the lighting seems a bit weird to me and makes the characters look almost puppet-like against the backdrop. All in all, I have no major complaints besides that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI really had no problem with the sound throughout the anime. I think all sound effects and background music were well-executed. Some people complain about the opening theme being a metal/screamo song instead of the usual jpop type of OP many anime have. I felt it was unusual and new, and probably the most unique thing about this anime. I also have a weak spot for metal anyways, so this appealed to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are either said to be very unoriginal and bland, or the polar opposite. I thought the characters were very well done. It isn't because they are super unique, but if you have any type of heart, then you will become attached to many characters in this anime. I am a sucker for sad backstories. If you are, too, then you will enjoy the characters of Servamp as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI guess I could say it was really enjoyable. I binge watched about half of it one night and finished it the next morning. Normally I'd binge watch it all in one night, so I cannot say my enjoyment exceeds an 8/10, but it is definitely worthy of that 8. I am also really looking forward to season 2 which is said to be coming out this year of 2017.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Servamp. Was it spectacular and the most amazing anime ever? No, not really. However, it was worth the watch. It is only 12 episodes, so it doesn't take much of your time. I would suggest to give it a chance if you like anime like Owari no Seraph for example. If you like bishounen vampires, overly \"anime\" type humor, cool fight scenes with cheesy character lines that are never let go, and memorable characters, then you'll enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI will be posting a more in-depth review on my new blog which is theotakutimesblog . wordpress . com\\n\r\nThe blog is currently still under editing but it will be up hopefully within the next couple of days.\\n\r\nThank you for reading!",

Started off at about a 7.5/10 but slowly got to about a 4.5-5/10. I was very disappointed that after all the action/anticipation the ending is not completed with a \"season finale battle\" so to speak.

            "content": "Servamp Anime Review\r\nBy: Tanaka Strike\r\nApril 23, 2019\r\nOverall: 7.8\r\nPlot: 7\r\nAs long as a human being is alive, there's only one thing that won't change. It's the sin of a human. The story is about seven vampires of which also named as seven major sins. It starts when a student picked a lone beautiful black cat on the way home, not knowing that it was a vampire. Along the serues, a bond between them will grow. And the past which Kuro, the vampire of sloth, wanted to bury will bring into light. There's really no amazing plot, interesting twist of the story, or unexpected turn of eventsthat happen. What excites me is the flashback of their past and the regret felt by the protagonist of the story. The way the story shows that sin is a natural part of life, the people make mistakes and acceptance is always around the corner. I also love the words of wisdom the characters said from their own perspective and belief. But it is kind of incomplete, it is lacking of justification and explanation as to why and how that thing happened. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nI hate weak characters. I hate those type who talk much more than do. Those who always blabber about their ideals, but is useless is really annoying. Well, the MC of the story is human so I guess it is understandable. What I find irritating is his speech of hope and friendship and saving, the kind of character who's only dependent on something dependable. Rest aside his character, the other character are cool and changed in a better way. They realize the things they have done wrong and decided to move forward, accept their mistakes. The fear they've felt, the number of times they ran away, they overcome it and was release from the burden they only made themselves. I love the character of Kuro. A very lazy person with an eyebag very noticeable, make me miss Lawliet.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation: 10\\n\\n\r\n\"Mendokse\". How I heard this expression so many times and how I love it. The voices of the characters are great and catchy. It really matches the expression of them which is really cool. Each of them is different from each other, but their all handsome and cute. The emotions was really attached on the characters expression. Lastly, the pyscho characters voices is really something. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI wanted Kuro. I love characters like him. Lazy but strong, cute and cool, serious and mysterious. Him being the highlight of the story made me enjoyed watching it. In a way, the series also made me curious of the sins past, the revelations that should happen and felt that I wanted more. \\n\\n\r\nEnding: 7\\n\\n\r\nI'm thinking that the ending is out of character. It was plain normal and the way the war cooled off was like a joke. Yes, I understand the human's emotion can also be answered by the same emotions. I get that he only want salvation, a person who will accept his existence. It is predictable if you see through the character. But as a viewer, you will always expect for more. More unexpected outcome in the end, more surprises and the like. Additionally, there were still unanswered questions. The ending was fine but if only there will be next season, it will be great.",

            "content": "Plot: 8\r\nCompared to Vampire Knight, at least I got a good action vampire plot from this anime. Having a vampire as a servant is quite cool and it's the first anime I've watched with such theme. Well, in terms of originality, I must deduct points for that because it's kinda of quite your typical master-slave relationship. \r\nCharacters: 6\r\nI'll just be discussing some characters here. \r\nMahiru: A typical must save all peace loving main character. Not fond of him but at he doesn't annoy me as much as the girl in Code Breaker. Shows some character development at the very end of the episodes (somewhere between10-12ep). However, I felt distant with the character. I don't know much about him. Where's his father, where's his uncle gone too? etc.\\n\\n\r\nKuro: I kind of like his lazy ass character. At least his not the typical cool, cold protagonist. However, so many questions left unanswered about him. I wish they developed his character a bit more. And also, his true powers, I wish they show more of his true, awesome powers as the first creation of the servamps! All I got to see is his sloppy side. Minus points for that. \\n\\n\r\nTsubaki: A moderate villain with lots of potential. Like Mahiru and Kuro, there's nothing much to this character. There's no character development at all. Like, I still don't know why is he in so much despair or why is he even created in the first place. Where does he come from? Whose' his Eve? He must have on since the others need one too. \\n\\n\r\nOP: 7\\n\r\nNice opening. Usually not my cup of tea but this one grabs my attention. \\n\\n\r\nOver all: 6. \\n\\n\r\nI would love to rate this story as high as 8.5 because with the kind of plot and foundations of awesome characters with cool powers, this story can go far. It could be even up par to SNK and the rest cool most favourited anime. But because of the plot holes, the rushed ending, the undeveloped character, I could only give a 6. Nevertheless, I still enjoy watching it, it still got me hook yet the last few episodes are kind of dragging (for me). \\n\\n",

            "content": "Not for someone wanting typical anime comedy or drama. This anime is, through and through, a journey of learning about the characters as the characters learn about themselves. It offers you several questions, but doesn't leave you hanging for the answer at the end of the anime. Everything is solved, and yes, the characters are indecisive compared to most stereotypical anime characters. But that just makes it more human. My enjoyment was a definite ten, but I rated it a nine because I always want to believe an awesome story like this can be even better.\r\nAnime like this, with full fledged characters, with unresolved feelings,history, and ideas. Characters with changeable emotions and struggles everyday. Characters that aren't numb, or gag characters, always happy or sad, a stereotypical glasses character, smart character, do good hero with a sense of unwavering justice, doing whatever is needed to be right- will not be found here. This anime is not about saving the world, or friendship, but about realizing that nothing is simple- nothing is black or white. It's about realizing that your decisions may vary or affect someone negatively, but that's okay. It's realizing that emotion and action can be scary and contradictory, that your \"ideals\" can be ironic or reinterpreted, that you might do something against those ideals and still have it be the right choice. It has an amazing impact.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this anime if you are introspective and prone to metacognition. It's uncomfortable if you aren't looking for something to understand or think about.  But to me, that makes it something wonderful.",

This is my first review btw, so please bear with me.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story drags you in from the very first episode, the pacing was perfect, it never felt slow or boring nor rushed like other anime. It has a good plot that it never deviated from and finally culminated into the ending which tied most loose seems together making for a complete and satisfiying ending, with all but a few questions still remaining unclear.\r\nCan't wait for it to get a second season!\r\nOverall 9/10\r\nArt: The character designsare very pretty, crisp and colorful looking, \\n\r\nthe animation is very good quality, the battle sequences are smooth and the movements fluid. Character art is pretty consistent and sharp, their faces don't suddenly become derpy or their arms like noodles when fighting or farther away as happens with the animation in some other anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing really stands out, The opening(although not my type) and ending songs where pretty good and even a somewhat catchy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: A colorful cast of lovable characters that you will quickly get attached to! Each one has an individual personality and although the background stories for most of the main cast aren't explored, what is explored, however, is very in depth and gives you more insight into the characters personality and why they came to be the way they are. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I personally enjoyed watching Servamp very much, it has everything i want in an anime: a good plot, endearing characters, gorgeous character design(bishounen), smooth animation, drama and a complete ending!\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall  i give Servamp 10/10! \\n\\n",

Well like stated below, the characters are real. Not only based off of their portrayed \"labels\", but in reality, tell me one time any of us have not crumbled under the \"friendship\".\r\nalso lets remember the ages in these anime. If you are older than 17+...of course you may not feel like it can resonate with you!! the largest watching party is normally in high school or early college!\r\nIt gets better, if you already made it to episode 4,i can promise by 5, 6, 7 it slowly becomes a lot like \"seraph of the end\" and stuff. I get the feeling that this wasn't created by the most professional or experienced artists, so with that in mind...they REALLY did a good job. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I checked this anime out because it (1) reminded me of Black Butler and (2) the VA's, especially Yuki Kaji. Brief appearances by Hiroshi Kamiya and Daisuke Ono (faves of mine). \r\nThe story has a simple pattern to follow, each servamp representing 7 sins and all that. It's not overly complicated. I think it's primarily meant to be a fun anime. It DOES attempt to get \"deep\" and I don't see anything wrong with that. Most people won't considered it properly executed, and if I was completely unbiased, I would agree. \r\nGiven how it only received 12 episodes, it's understandably a RUSHED anime. Friendships buildpretty fast by the 3rd episode, and they don't stand if you give it too much thought. The ending will undoubtedly disappoint many. I was (VERY), BUT I plan to check out the manga and hope there's something different, deeper, and overall better. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I watch things primarily for the CHARACTERS and their interactions with each other. So, I found this anime VERY enjoyable mostly because I invest primarily on characters just a little bit more than plot execution. I loved the servamps and how we were able to learn a lot about at least 3 of them. Some of the Eves hint at deeper backstories, but, again, 12 episodes isn't enough to expand. I hope the manga goes further.\\n\\n\r\nMight come down to personal tasted, but my #1 problem is Mahiru. Yes, yes, he's a basic protagonist, the Every Man here... but he's so ANNOYING at times. And the lines he repeats, while they ARE his way of life... still ANNOYING to hear every episode. I only tolerate him because he's nothing without Kuro.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I enjoyed it overall. As of writing this review (Jan. 12, 2017) I heard the manga author is ill, so the manga will go into hiatus. I hope she recovers soon.\\n\\n",

            "content": "SPOILERS: THIS REVIEW CONTAIN SPOILERS \r\nStory: The story center around Mahiru. As a kid that he grew up after his mother is dead his uncle decide to adopt him as his own and learn the phrase \"simple is best\". Which is a great phrase... That I should learn. \r\nHence he adopt a cat and name him Kuro. One day after coming back from school he found a man in his home watching TV and eating some cup noodle. \r\nHe warn Mahiru to not to say his name but since this is a shounen anime which I have no idea why this is a shoujo anime.He has to open his mouth and BAM those two are bound together for at 24 hrs unless Kuro have Mahiru blood. Once his friend got stab by a servamp or a servant vampire. He has been bond together as vampire and eve as he try to stop the Tsubaki also the 8th servamp. \\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: The animation is like the show is not bad but is not great as well. Oh don't get me wrong there are some great art in the series that look fantastic like Kuro mental state of problem and Hydes past but other than that nothing special. I usually don't called out studio but I'm gonna do it this time. Brain's base I expected better from you. This is the same studio who made Baccano, Natsume yuujinchou, Durarara and one of my favorite sport anime from 2016 cheer boys. I just felt it could be better a little bit as specially the ED. Like, ok... I get it kekkai sensen ED was pretty popular... can we move on from that ED?? Then we have the OP.... I'm not gonna talk about it here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: No offense but Mahiru is bland. He is a typical shounen protagonist like Nagai kei from Ajin. A simple guy that wants to live in a simple life but he couldn't. I don't see him as a MC hell I don't see any of the characters in the series needed besides from Hydes, Mikumi and Licht. None of them get any character development that they should have gotten. Misano is a little angry little shouta. While, Testu is a character that should be in Hatsukoi monster instead of this series and the rest were there to be there characters. The only point that Mahiru to be there is for the faint of his friend, Sakuya. We learn that Sakuya is a sub-class of Tsubaki. Sub-class are the human almost dying then turn into a servamp. Sub-classes are not allowed to disobey the master order. Therefore, Sakuya must follow his master order Tsubaki and disobey if he wants to live. Tsubaki is a psychotic villain that likes to make bad puns like Fango without the puns from 91 days but his character is different. Unlike Fango which is a psychotic person throughout the series. Tsubaki is a person that actually have some caring side to him showing that he does care for his sub-classes. Most psychotic characters will go psychotic to everyone even his own minions. unfortunately, this series doesn't like to keep a lot of good thing. Like the OP(still not talking about that yet). Now for the other servamp they are barely develop. I mean Doubt-Doubt has nothing special going on beside having a boxes as his head. Lily is nothing but a stripper, making kids to sub-classes and finding the reason why Mikumi and his brother can't like each other. Also we never get to see the Gluttony and Warth besides flashback and there is the buildup between the battle of the 7 servamp and Tsubaki. Kuro is the best character next to Tsubaki. Cute in cat form and the distance between the other servamp and seeing him not being one of the best servamp so Mahiru can actually proceed and snap him out of his order of mental despair. now we the best character Hydes. Introduces in the middle of the series I thought that he is gonna be the worst character of the entire series. However episode 10 happen and change my perspective of his character (not gonna spoil anything). \\n\\n\r\nNow for the OP... I HATE THE OPENING. Is so hard listen and hard to get into it. Sure the visual were ok. But the song... You got OLDCODEX. I REPEAT OLDCODEX AND YOU WASTED THEIR TALENT. Usually I won't be this mad... But I enjoy some oldcodex AND YOU WASTED IT. They sang a lot of my favorite op and ed. \\n\\n\r\n<<Now please skip this part of the review as I am gonna talk about finale of the show and why it felt flat. So if you want to watch servamp skip to recommendation>>\\n\\n\r\nNow for the climax that we are waiting for... A hug... Are you kidding A HUG?! We have waited for an epic battle... the climax was real and it was real and you gave us a hug at the end. So why is Tsubaki mad and angry??? Nobody loves him. You are kidding me... Tsubaki a psychotic person that make a raining storm of sword out of the sky, has an army of sub-classes and mess with people mind for love?! That is stupid and NO you can't do such a thing. That sort ending can happen if they warn us a few episode back. take Shouwa we already know how is it gonna end as they show us in the first epsiode. This is the biggest problem of servamp. What the hell do you want to do?? Similar to Re:zero, servamp does not know what to be. Does it want to be a serious action anime or does it want to be a comedy action anime?? Hence it felt the series is doing too much overall. In the end is quite fun to watch but I see many other series does it better. \\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: So... do I recommend it... No... Not really... like I say is not great but is also not bad. However I do recommend it as an anime to get some time off your back if you have nothing to watch... Go watch servamp.\\n\\n\r\nOther recommendation: Noragami where the human and spirits fight together but instead of spirit is vampire. Then we have Owari no seraph both uses vampires and human relationship a little bit better than servamp.\\n\\n\r\nSo servamp get an overall score of 5.5 out of 10. Like I say not bad but not good either.  \\n\\n\r\nSo would I say that servamp to be the worst anime of 2016?? OH HELL NO... I have sat through big order, bloodivores, Taboo tattoo and hundred.",

Guessing you have already seen it then it's the freaking vampires. Why are they called vampires? They don't need to suck blood, they are immortal and are created by a human. So considering that, why make them obey after you have given them a name, your blood andan item. If you make some awesome creatures, you wouldn't want them to obey someone else and go after you right? that's a pretty stupid mistake to make.\\n\\n\r\nAlso you can only kill them buy destroying the object, if you just attack them they turn back into their little \"cute\" state which in itself is kinda bullshit. But when they are in their \"cuute\" state, they don't even have objects on them so they are pretty much immortal by that time. AND objects are given by masters so if they don't have a master they can't die ever????\\n\\n\r\nThis is just a little part why I really disliked it other than missing main characters, boring plot developemend and other stuff that you can conveniently find on my channel on YouTube if you search for MudanTV. I even throw some funny sketches in there, freaking 10 hours of work on a video and only 20 people see it, such is life.",
