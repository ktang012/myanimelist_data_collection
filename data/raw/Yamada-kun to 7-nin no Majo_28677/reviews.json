            "content": "In terms of an Honest review , This anime is pretty good , at first i thought it would be Alot of \" Ecchi/Harem\"Type of  aspect in this anime  Judging it based on the english translation which is Yamada-kun and the seven witches . However, that is not the case as this anime has real potential on how the characters are developing and how the story is progressing as the series goes by.\r\nThe negative thing about the anime is Body-swapping , Body-swapping in anime usually means one thing, and that\u2019s fanservice. I\u2019m not the world\u2019s biggest fanservice devotee. Fanservice can devour an anime\u2019splot and turn a show gross and mean in a heartbeat. In the worst cases, fanservice turns otherwise interesting characters into inauthentic caricatures of themselves, all in pursuit of the almighty panty shot.\\n\\n\r\nBut, I am happy to say that the first two volumes of Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches, at least so far, is just as good as people make it out to be; that\u2019s a really big surprise, considering how a title like this could easily go wrong and end up a shallow fanservice style story. Yamada-kun is a very funny manga with a lot of heart and character that really all comes together in just the right way. There are flaws certainly, but the positives more than adequately outweigh the negatives.\\n\\n\r\nI have also watched the Last episode when it came out and i must say it ended pretty damn good for the first season which i will not spoil. Will see how the story progresses from there and will do another review on the next season?:P\\n\\n\r\nPositive thing which is really good about the anime is the :\\n\r\nOpening\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nArt & Character\\n\\n\r\nStory sometimes can get off plot if you watch the anime you will know what i mean by this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S Please actually read the review throughly before \"Pressing the unhelpful\" button lol",

            "content": "My first experience with Yamada-Kun to 7-nin no Majo was with the manga. Seeing it as one of the popular ones, and my favorite tags of comedy, school life and romance, I decided I would give it a whirl. Immediately hooked, I read about 50 chapters before stopping to go to sleep. However, after that, I was bogged down with school work and the like and I never got around to continuing it. I didn't have time for anime or manga at that point and went on about a 4 month break. However, recently the stars aligned and summer started and I had time towatch. So with all the episodes out, I decided to binge the entire thing and be done with it, even if it isn't as good as the manga. So without further ado, here's my review of Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nThe story isn't unique, nor is it a masterpiece. However, it has its merits. The school romcom genre is already well established, and it isn't the first time that we've seen one mixed with supernatural. It also isn't the first time that we've seen an anime centered around kissing. And the characters in the harem (my opinion, others think that harem isn't correct) aren't the most unique either. But I can get to that later. The story, with only information from the title and the first episode, is centered around  our male protagonist, Yamada Ryu, the delinquent of the school. Upon his introduction, we are also introduced to Shiraishi Urara, whom I consider the female protagonist. Unlike Yamada, who is a violent, lazy delinquent, Shiraishi could be described as the ideal student: quiet, studious, and attractive. In essence, they are polar opposites. The plot arises when Yamada walks up the stairs and pushes Shiraishi aside. While doing so, they both trip and fall down the stairs. After blacking out, Yamada wakes up in the infirmary, only to realize that he is now in Shiraishi's body instead of his own. After some time, they realize that switching bodies is achieved through a kiss. Based on the title, we can assume that there are 7 witches, each with their own power. The strength in the story isn't the plot itself, but the execution of it. While the plot is certainly interesting, it's nothing we haven't seen before. However, the way it is executed is what sets it apart. The anime doesn't take itself overly seriously. It knows when it should be a lighthearted comedy, and it knows when to be a more serious, supernatural mystery story. Overall, the plot is interesting and is delivered well, but is no masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nNow I dabble a bit in drawing manga style characters, but I'm no judge of great art. However, even I can tell that this series looks good. Many of the backgrounds are well drawn, and the colors are typically bright and pop out. But the main point of this art score is the character design. The characters are all designed uniquely and are easily differentiated from each other. All the characters are designed in a way that makes them hard to forget, and they are all unique from the other students to signify their importance to the story. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nFor me, the soundtrack was for the most part good but forgettable. I wouldn't mind listening to the soundtrack while watching, but I wouldn't go out of my way to listen to it again. So you would think that sound would be a bit lower, and honestly, I would put it around 5 or 6. However, the OP and ED are extremely catchy, and for those alone, I put sound at 7. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nAs I said before, the characters aren't exactly original. You've got the tsundere, the kuudere, the loli, the older sister, etc. etc. However, for the most part, they are fairly likeable and undergo some form of development. Because the series is condensed into 12 episodes, the development happens much faster and sometimes feels awkward and forced. The only two witches who I think get any sort of notable development are Shiraishi Urara and Odagiri Nene, who is personally my favorite of the bunch. For the rest, their motives are typically defined by a single point, which is often just given rather than explained. As such, the characters are fun, but typically lack depth outside of this one point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI try not to be the biggest critic, and there are merits to this anime. While there are flaws, if you go in with the right expectations and try not to think too much while watching, you'll come out most likely happy and satisfied. The ending resolves most of the problems, even though I could literally see it coming a mile away. Sure, it's predictable and cliche, but there is a lot of fun to be had here. Take it for what it is: a fun, supernatural romcom with a sprinkling of story. If you expect more from it, you will likely end up disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nYamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo was a fun watch and had me laughing at times. It was a good experience, and I can happily say that it is most likely worth your time. It's no masterpiece, but then again, most shows aren't. It ranks fairly highly among my recently watched anime, even though I haven't watched that many recently. If you need a deep, plot driven drama, then this isn't for you. However, if you need a lighthearted romcom with supernatural elements, check out Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo. You won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n~Thanks for reading my review! I'm still fairly new to this whole writing reviews business, so any advice or tips is entirely welcome. Also, rating helpful or not would be, well, helpful for me to see if I'm writing these correctly. If someone wants to talk anime with me, feel free to message me. I'm typically online at least a few times a week.~",

            "content": "Ever imagined being someone else? That idea may have come across your mind sometime in your life. No really, I\u2019m sure almost everyone at least had that thought once in their lifetime. So what happens when there\u2019s a case of body swapping and you become a person of the opposite gender? I think that would be very peculiar experience. Yamada-kun to 7-in no Majo (Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches) operates under circumstances where two main characters changes their bodies and well, you can guess from here that all sort of drama comes rolling.\r\nThe series is adapted from the manga of the same name that runsfor over 160+ chapters and is still ongoing. Directed by Takuno Seiki, the show is a hit or miss. The hit part could be the comedy as the show really likes to play around a lot with itself. That\u2019s because the body switching gimmick isn\u2019t the only concept explored in this series. If you read the title, you\u2019ll notice the word, \u201cwitches\u201d. In a nutshell, there should be expectations that other sorts of magical or supernatural phenomenon will propel itself into the story. And that\u2019s not an understatement. The miss part would be the storytelling. Before the series debuted, it was announced that the series would only be adapted into a 1 cour span of (12 episodes). It\u2019s not a split cour, not a 2 cour, and definitely not a good piece of news to remember in mind. \\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake. The series takes off pretty quick as the pilot episode establishes the body switching gimmick quickly without wasting time. No more than 10 minutes into the series and you\u2019ll see a guy (Yamada) staring into the mirror and realizes that he no longer has \u201cit\u201d. On the other hand, there\u2019s the smart and beautiful Uraha Shiraishi who is now in the body of a delinquent. This all happened by a coincidental event when they landed on each other off a flight of stairs. While this all seems troublesome, they do discover that reversing the effect involves a kiss. This also revives the Supernatural Studies Club, a group of students dedicated in studying supernatural phenomenon. By this point, I think you can get adjusted to the idea of the show. It\u2019s one of those series that really likes to play around with itself from the very beginning. In fact, almost every episode features some sort of unusual circumstance that ends up causing a lot of drama for the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs a club composed of several members, the series gives the audience some insight on them. The titular character Ryu Yamada is easily noticeable for his delinquent-like traits and personality. Throughout the series, we see him as guy that uses his fist to do the talking although he does care quite a lot about his friends. Uraha is more of a polar opposite. Smart, beautiful, and stoic in a way, she often keeps to herself and is often thinks before she acts. The way the show formulates their relationship at first almost feels like it\u2019s on auto-pilot. Since neither character are similar, they have to learn more about each other. In the story, we see how that progresses with each episode. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t say that their relationship is really believable. While some series can easily capture the audience\u2019s attention with polar opposite characters, this one just ticks a bit way too much with the comedy. Not to mention, we have the kissing part that is used as a plot device. The romance aspect of it feels forced and quickly rushed without developing much for our characters. However, I do have to say that the chemistry between Yamada and Uraha can be surprisingly charming. There\u2019s a genuine mutual respect and feeling the two share as we can easily see that later on in the show. As for the other characters, we have Toranosuke Miyamura who serves more as a middleman, Miyabi Ito with her fascination of supernatural phenomenon, and Kentaro Tsubaki who happens to have a crush on Uraha. While not as prominent as Yamada and Uraha, they do play some key roles in the series. Unfortunately, some of them can be easily forgettable after first impressions.\\n\\n\r\nThen, there are the witches. There\u2019s seven of them including Uraha. The series early on establishes the fact that all of them have a different power. We don\u2019t know most of their powers or how they work until the witches reveal themselves. And as a 1 cour series, the show tries to seize every opportunity to capture that point. However, this is a really sour attempt to get screen time for them. The way the witches are introduced may leave some good first impressions but overall lacks development. Sure, some of them even get a decent characterization but by adaptation standards, too much is left out. The structure of the show suffers a lot from cramming and some episodes even takes a lot to get their own stories started. Also, relationship dynamics are played more for comedy so it\u2019s hard to take it seriously. On the plus side, I have to give some credit to the clever powers that the series introduces. Each witch has a different power and all of them can create some rather entertaining storytelling. Additionally, each of the witches has different personalities so the story does feel a bit refreshing with such a direction.\\n\\n\r\nDespite having a lot of character and story pacing issues, one major aspect of the show that can win its audience over may be the comedy. The series isn\u2019t a parody of witches but it can be genuinely funny. Yamada is a character that acts often in brash manners so his actions will definitely provoke some laughter if you see the trouble he gets himself into. Then, there are the powers. The concept of body swapping itself can be amusing to think about especially if a guy becomes a hot girl. Some of the other powers are troublesome but the show itself plays each gimmick cleverly to adapt with the developing story. There are also tons of kissing and although most series today makes it a highlight point between character relationships, this series does it casually and seems to be even self-aware. In general, comedy portrayal is a highlight and can be appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork in general is generic yet works well. The character designs is what is attractive for the overall adaptation. The guys hardly stand out; well perhaps except Yamada. However, the girls really are designed with attractiveness such as Uraha. In particular, the witches are all noticeable in some way or form with their hairstyles, figures, and even status symbol. Despite taking place in the school setting, there\u2019s a load going on besides just in the classrooms. In essence, we see many places of the school explored with a fine degree of clever decorating. I also have to give some praise to the character expressions as it enhances the comedy aspect of the series overall.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I\u2019m not a big fan of the soundtrack, the series does know how to utilize them. As the series portrays a lot of comedy, it\u2019s important to capitalize on the atmosphere so the series makes use of more colorful OST. In most respects, it works well to get the viewers laughing. However, it\u2019s nothing outstanding in terms of quality as it\u2019s very standard. The OP and ED theme songs has a warm feeling to it though that is sung with a soft melancholic tone. But when it comes down to it, the characters\u2019 voice mannerism will probably win you over. Yamada is a key figure to notice with his commanding voice as he gets into a lot of troublesome circumstances. Indeed, the series has this ability to communicate its gimmicks with the voices of the characters. Whether it\u2019s the diverse voice mannerism of the witches, the Supernatural Club, or even the Student Council, it always seems to be noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nGender bender isn\u2019t a new concept used by the anime industry. Neither are witch powers, kissing, or a club that investigates unusual cases. Rather, I take this show as more of a comedy story with a bit of clever gimmicks thrown in at you on a weekly basis. The episodes themselves each tell a story with something that sticks with the overall theme of the series. Just note that by adaptation and storytelling standards, it doesn\u2019t shine well especially with the structure, rushing, and is easily predictable. On the plus side, the comedy really can bring some laughs. Ever had a bad day and you wanted something to laugh about? Perhaps this series can be what you\u2019re looking for. The series itself is like a personality.",

            "content": "At first, i didn't have any interest to this anime. I was just picking some random spring anime to watch. I really didn't have any big hope for this anime. But surprisingly, it was pretty good.\r\nStory : 8/10\r\nYamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo is a story about Ryuu Yamada, a second-year Suzaku High School student, who one day accidentally kiss a girl and later he finds out that he has Witch's power that is activated with a kiss. Beside Yamada, there are still other witches with various powers in the school to be encountered.\r\nThe story and the concept were kinda unique to me. As i wentthrough episodes, it became more interesting. In the middle episode of the anime, i started to read the manga. The adaption was really great. But like others said, it was rushed compared to the manga. They skipped and changed some scenes from the manga. Gladly they only skipped the minor parts, so it didn't really affect the storyline. The ending also was pretty good and well-executed, definitely it won't dissapoint you.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\r\nThe art was pretty nice. It's pretty colorful, the designs were great, the animations, backgrounds, etc. All were well-animated. Your eyes will enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound was also really good. The Background Sound fitted well with the scenes and situations. The seiyuus also did great job voicing the characters. The opening song was really great, it was nice to hear and pretty catchy, You won't even skip the opening song when the anime is played. The ending song was didn't really good, but still nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8/10\\n\r\nThe main characters led the story pretty good. They were well-developed. The characters were funny, cute and lovely. They had various, different & unique personalities, backgrounds, etc, made you interested enough to enjoy the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyments : 9/10\\n\r\nThis show really exceeded my expectations.  After finished one episode, i'd be curious what'll happen next and really excited for the upcoming episode. The show brings me enjoyments and satisfactions everytime i watch it. All i can say is i really love this show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8/10\\n\r\nAlthough the story was rushed, Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo still proved its qualities and is definitely a worth watching. For you who want a nice, fun to watch, heartwarming, and entertaining show, Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo is a must watch one.",

            "content": "When i first saw this anime i was very doubtful it would be good for two reasons:the description sounded like it would be boring though it did catch my eye haven't see an anime like this in a long while and i heard it was rushed.I heard like about 100 chapters worth of content was being crammed into 12 episodes which is absolutely ridiculous i thought there was no way it could be good however i was proven wrong from the first episode.Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo stands apart from the anime that have been coming out in recent seasons its not the best thingever but the whole body switching aspect glued me in on the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nStory:8 The story is about yamada who while going up the stairs switched bodies with a girl.After returning to his body and learning about witches,students at his school with special powers he sets out to find the other witches who all have different abilities which activate with a kiss.The story was pretty interesting i thoroughly enjoyed it.The story is very eye catching i mean a guy switching bodies with a kiss haven't seen that in a while.I typically don't enjoy gender bender anime all that much but this one i did because it wasn't just about switching bodies the past about other witches and their powers were flesh out.Though i felt the story at points felt rushed i still enjoyed it. \\n\\n\r\nArt:8 The art is pretty good,makes this anime look different from the other anime this season but it wasn't the greatest thing ever or the best this season but it was unique. \\n\\n\r\nSound:7 The sound was ok i liked the opening and ending though the music played throughout the series was kinda forgettable maybe just isn't my kind of music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7 I didn't like a lot of them at first but they grew on me over the series.Time was spent showing the back stories of the witches however it felt a little rushed at times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8 I enjoyed Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo a lot it was a good anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8 For an anime that adapted like 100 chapters into 12 episodes it did pretty good it felt rushed at times but i could still understand the story and didn't really feel that something was terribly missing however it would have been good to have more episodes to flesh out the characters more but for what it did it was good.This anime is different from the standard harem/romance anime.I didn't really feel like this was a harem anime and unlike most harems out there,there was romance progression.The main character didn't beat around the bush he was honest with his feelings and ended up with one girl at the end. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"All you wanted was a kiss, right?\" - Yamada\r\nArtwork and Animation: 7\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I believe this is LIDENFILMS' first solo anime production. From a cursory search, it seems they were also a 2nd on Arlsan Senki, also new this season. With that in mind, I have to say that this is a solid first outing for a new studio. The characters and backgrounds retain a consistent quality throughout, and while nothing was groundbreaking, it was very easy to watch. I never noticed any major dips in quality, and it moves fluidly. \r\nSound and Voice Acting: 9\r\nThe opening and ending themes arerather catchy, upbeat J Pop tunes. Listenable, and set the tone for a lighthearted romantic comedy such as this.\\n\r\nSaori Hayami (Hatoko, Inou Battle)  and Ryota Osaka head up the cast as Urara Shiraishi and Yamada-kun, and do a good job selling the quiet, cute girl, and the delinquent ruffian, respectively. \\n\r\nThe supporting cast usurps the spotlight some, though, with Eri Kitamura (Takagi, HOTD) as Nene Odagiri, Maaya Uchida (Rikka, Chuunibyou) as Itou Miyabi, and even All Hail Lelouch, Jun Fukuyama as the class president, Yamazaki. Overall a very good group of varied voices that give some personality to what may have otherwise been a real cookie cutter cast filling in blanks for a generic romcom harem show, which this is not. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and Story: 8, 6\\n\\n\r\nYamada-kun has a decently small cast for a show that promises at least 8 characters in the title. We're introduced to Yamada and his friend Miyamura, the student council VP (who start up the Supernatural Studies Club again) first. The group grows from there to include the hyperactive geeky girl Ito and the quiet beauty Shiraishi. After Yamada finds out that with a kiss, he and Shiraishi are able to change bodies Freaky Friday style, he learns that there are other girls causing trouble at school with odd \"powers\", such as a charming power, telepathy, the power to give nightmares, and others.\\n\\n\r\nTo further the issue, in order for Miyamura to get the nod from the current student council president to be the president's successor, he and Yamada, along with the Supernatural Studies Club are tasked with uncovering the identities of the seven \"Witches\" of Suzaku high school. However, Nene Odagiri, another candidate for the position, is also out to figure out the identity of these witches before Miyamura does. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, I thought that this really was just going to be the anime version of Freaky Friday, with Yamada and Shiraishi swapping bodies and causing all kinds of trouble for themselves that way, but to my pleasant surprise, Yamada-kun really switched it up and kept the show fresh. With the addition of the other witches and their powers, along with how they affected Yamada and his friends' personal lives, it really sewed the show up together nicely. \\n\\n\r\nThe nearly constant addition of new characters wasn't burdensome to try and keep track of- and it gave the show a somewhat episodic feel, while still furthering the main plot. Some of the supporting characters were as interesting to watch interact with and scheme against Yamada as watching the antics of Yamada himself. I personally enjoyed that the antagonistic characters stayed true to form, even when they reached the ends of their respective episodic arcs. The characters, while not necessarily unique, were definitely entertaining. My personal favorite was probably Nene Odagiri or Tempura boy who cooks when he gets depressed. \"ANYTHING BUT THE TEMPURA!\"\\n\\n\r\nThere are some of the typical tropes in Yamada-kun, like the unrequited love, and the misunderstood confessions/wrong place wrong time mishaps, but it takes these and runs with them, rather than trying to spoonfeed the viewer a trite romance show. The powers that the witches have provide a lot of fun situations, and the powers themselves were interesting in how they affected the plot and how the characters went about solving the problems they presented, and by proxy- the problems of the witch herself. The show is a nice little slice of life with a decent romance plot, and some magic thrown in for fun.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nYamada-kun was definitely the surprise of this season. I started watching it the week before the final episode aired, and I found that I was more anxious to watch the next episodes when they were all right in front of me way more than if I had to wait a week! I really enjoyed the fact that the harem and ecchi factors were at an absolute minimum. I never felt like I was being beat over the head with anyone's body, and when the mild nudity did arise- it was played off as a gag, and not made into a point of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance itself was also pretty believable, and heartfelt. I wasn't being told repeatedly that Yamada and the girl were in love, but rather shown. Show, not tell- and it worked here. Despite that I almost never enjoy romance shows, I found myself fairly invested in the show, especially at/after episode 10. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that I liked Yamada-kun a lot more than I thought I would when I read the premise. I'm no romance fan, and I couldn't care less about whatever the hot new ecchi harem is, but I had several recommendations for the show from other users here, and I have to admit, they were right about Yamada-kun. Definitely one of the best anime this season.",

            "content": "I'm glad I watched it, and, despite the fact that I absolutely loved it, this is one of the few times I'll say I'm glad there wont be a second season. The reason for this is because it's perfect as it is and I could only see more as detracting from the whole. If you're looking for a lighthearted rom/com I strongly recommend watching this, in fact, if you haven't seen it already stop reading and go watch it, like right now...\r\nStory 9/10: The main story line behind this anime is good but it's a harem rom-com and there's only so much you can expectat the same time . While there are plenty of surprises it's not going to throw you through a loop anytime soon; however, the unique ideas and their presentation throughout the story wont leave you feeling like you just waited an episode to watch what you already knew was going to happen. Part of the reason I scored story so high was also because of the dialogue/situations which are so memorable and entertaining, in addition to very well done. To sum it up it's an interesting and funny story that sticks to being light-hearted in nature while throwing in just the right amount of drama to pull you in and keep you invested/wanting to know will happen next. Also, on a side note, while there is a harem tag for this anime the story goes very easy on this point and doesn't let it interfere with the story so don't be put off by it.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: The art was well done both with the character designs and background and the animation was fluid. While there is nothing lacking on this front it's not amazing; however, it fits the mood of the anime to a point. While it may not be as detailed or crisp as some other anime I believe anything different would have only hurt the overall feeling this anime gives to its viewers.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: Shout-out to the absolutely amazing voice-actors/actresses in this anime they did a superb job. Due to the nature of the story the voices of the characters often have to represent the personalities of others and the talent and skill that went into portraying and nailing this perfectly didn't entirely hit me until later. The OP was amazing, I listened to it every episode (which is kind of rare, normally I skip them) The ED was good and it felt like it summed up the feelings of the anime, but I can't summon the same enthusiasm for it as I did the OP. As for the OST, I didn't really notice it... which is a good thing :D It wasn't spectacular but it fit the anime well enough that it was able to enhance/match the mood without distracting you from what was going on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10: I can't really decide if this was lacking or not so I'll have to settle for the fact that character development seemed a bit rushed. Aside from the MC, and in some ways the club members, the other notable characters don't get too much time, especially the other witches, while they do have enough back-story and depth to give you a feel for or understand them I kind of felt like if I'd blinked at the wrong time I would have missed something important. All the same though they were at least able to be developed to an extent, allowing distinct personalities/emotions to come through with a basis for where they came from.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: The worst part about light-hearted rom-coms and especially harems is that they tend to use cliche scenarios without any care for uniqueness, It's like the directors expect you to have the same reaction to a situation every time you see it, and its because of this that I enjoyed this anime so much. The dialogue/scenarios are what set this apart from the midden heap that is slowly becoming the harem and/or rom-com genre. This anime will make you laugh, but most importantly it will leave you feeling complete, like I said in the beginning anything more would just detract from this anime. The story starts with a bang, sweeping you off your feet, and when it comes to a conclusion it sets you down so softly at the finish line all you can do is look back and smile.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: Worth every second and I hope the rest of you enjoyed it as much as I did, and if you haven't seen it yet I hope my review might make you consider watching it, Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "All my reviews are spoiler free aimed towards people who haven't seen the show.\r\nYamada-kun and the Seven Witches. \r\nThe best recipe for the most delicious cake, all you gotta do is give the time it needs to bake, but noooo, gotta have it now, turning up the heat doesn't make it bake faster, IT JUST BURNS!!!.... \r\nStory: Ryuu Yamada is known as a delinquent in his high school. One day, he accidentally falls from a flight of stairs onto Urara Shiraishi, the ace student of the school. Yamada wakes up to find that he has swapped bodies with her! The two try to reverse thechange and discover that kissing triggers the body swap. Yamada takes advantage of this asking Shiraishi to take tests for him and discovers while in her body that she gets picked on for being such a model student. Yamada and his delinquent ways put a stop to the girls picking on her. Student council vice-president Toranosuke Miyamura, discovers this little event and recruits the two to revive the Super Natural Studies Club. Yamada and Shiraishi continue to use this exchange until an unexpected encounter with a certain girl reveals a another usual power activated by a kiss, in fact there may even be a few more....... thus the Super Natural Studies Club declare to discover the secrets of the Suzaku High School \"witches\". Although this task doesn't come with easy, nor does the situation turn out to be as simplistic as they thought.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters all fall under hard personality tropes. No surprise there really, they are well written though. The cast is considerably large, all have some interesting backstory as well. Unfortunately because of time restraint, you only get a glimpse of these characters potential depth and with a flip of the dime, that's their character development. The best part of the show is the quality voice acting. The cast is great and their performances, especially Saori Hayami as Shiraishi and Ryota Osaka as Yamada are absolutely brilliant! Yamada is always late for school, naps in class and gets abysmal grades. His life is a dead bore. Even though he's a delinquent,  he's kinda a nice guy... for the most part. Urara Shiraishi is an exceptionally brilliant student known to be cold and asocial, due to her being ostracized by the students of Suzaku High. Miaymura is charismatic, be able to easily charm most people around him thanks to his look and being friendly in general. Despite this, he doesn't really have any friends. Miyabi is a considerably attractive and cheerful girl, due to her strange interest in the super natural, she is considered among her peers to be a fraud and a liar.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: It's pretty solid. The colors are nice and they move quite well. All the witches have a very distinct and interesting design. Some of their glamor drawings are absolutely beautiful. The OP was amazingly done. As was some of the faded frames during flashbacks and things of that nature. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The music was pretty decent. Love \"Kuchizuke Diamond\" by WEAVER. Actually started listen to more of their songs. Choice of BGM was fun when it needed to be and dramatic when it should. It did it's job.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is where I'm torn. I thought is was really funny, I also thought it was very clever concept. I love the chemistry shown between our MC and lead witch. I also like all the characters and the story behind their personality and actions. But it wasn't nearly fleshed out enough to make the connection between Yamada and the witches, it was all really forced. And then the story was also incredibly rushed. The scenes were good but lacked any impact when they were so abruptly introduced and resolved. Near the end it almost became confusing, and not in a in-depth convoluted sense, but more like, \"well we're running out of time, so we'll skip the why and just go with the how\". \\n\\n\r\nSo much was cut out, not just comedy but little bits of development that would make character relationships feel like they had a connection. And the quick pace eliminated any type of suspense or mystery to the development of the story. All of this could have been avoided with another 12 episodes and following the source material. This could have been an incredible show. As it is, it's merely fun. Definitely worth  watching.  7/10.",

            "content": "SPOILER FREE REVIEW\r\nYou fap to Yuri shamelessly? You have diabetes because you overdose on Vanilla? You secretly worship Yaoi? You openly admit that you love all three? This anime basically is one-size-fits-all for everyone of all sexual orientations and preferences.\r\nYamada-kun and the Seven Bitches (you read that right), or Y7 for short, is a surprisingly good anime with an actual, plot-line, legit romance and some interesting characters. The premise isn\u2019t unique, ground-breaking or interesting at first glance, but it\u2019s all in the execution. Yep people, shits actually get done in here, shits that are relevant to the story. It\u2019s a rom-com with an actual plotand story progression, what else could one wish for? Another thing I liked is that the anime stays true to its light-hearted theme and doesn\u2019t try to creep into the realm of philosophy. Because it makes no sense for high school idiots to keep spewing out Aristotle crap about life and the universe unless they were tripping balls.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not too sure about the Harem tag being there, I mean a dude going around kissing and getting intimate with a bunch of Bitches isn\u2019t Harem at all. Jokes aside, there aren\u2019t any discernible Harem elements, at most a triangle but it resolved itself anyway. \\n\\n\r\nPlot 8/10\\n\r\nThe plot is essentially about our male lead going around kissing random Bitches and Hoes and Dudes to solve his life problems. One ticket to Y7-land please. The overarching plot isn't revealed half-way into the anime but it\u2019s focused, doesn\u2019t deviate to some stupid, pointless fillers. It gets somewhat darker towards the end as opposed to the usually light and comedic theme, but it has a good transition. The pacing is somewhat rushed but still slow enough for me to comprehend wtf is going on. In general, the execution of the plot was outstanding, you will be gripped till the very end. 11/10 would kiss again - IGN\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy aspect is simply fucking hilarious. I had many good laughs from this series, and even as much as rewatching certain scenes. The immaturity, dirty-ness and fan service is integral to the comedy and they were done to a reasonable extent, appropriate according to the situations, not overblown and redundant to the point of borderlining ecchi (looking at you, monogatari series). Let\u2019s be honest that the first thing you\u2019d do after switching body with someone of the opposite sex is touching yourself incessantly.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance slowly and naturally develops as the story progresses and it actually makes sense, wasn\u2019t too abrupt, full of retarded melodrama, crying or misunderstandings. In the end I genuinely wanted our main couple to be together. NOW KISS.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7.5/10\\n\r\nEye-pleasingly bright and vivid (seriously, their eyes glow brighter than my future). Character art is relatively unique and appealing that I can distinguish one character from another with ease. The quality stays consistent throughout and doesn\u2019t deteriorate like many other series at certain scenes. Overall the art and animation is excellent and worthy of praise.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP animation killed some of the anticipation by giving away the identity of the Seven Bitches and the main couple pairing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10\\n\r\nThe OP is fairly upbeat and catchy, I find myself listening to it occasionally but not the ED. There isn\u2019t a wide range of OSTs, they're repeated but really add to the enthusiastic mood and are quite entertaining to hear.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial commendation goes to the voice actors as they\u2019ve done a terrific job of voicing the characters especially when they switch bodies. The exceptional voice acting is a major source of comedy and enjoyability of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10 \\n\r\nThe cast is quite large for a 12-episode anime to handle, as such the characters\u2019 background stories are barely explored, just enough to explain their motives and personalities. In the end, a lot of them didn\u2019t receive development and was left out as it all boils down to our main couple, Yamada and Shiraishi.\\n\\n\r\n- Yamada: Introduced as an aggressive delinquent and is actually an aggressive delinquent, not suddenly turned into some generic nice, caring main lead over time. He\u2019s a meanie that I can relate to, I mean he\u2019s tired of school n shit, so true for me right now. On another note, he\u2019s fucking hilarious.\\n\r\n- SHIRAISHI BEST BITCH. Kuudere is the best dere and on top of that, she\u2019s a busty, nice and caring blonde, who wouldn\u2019t want a piece of that? She received the most development and obviously I was drawn into her. Speculatively she has a dark side as evident in her malicious glare on the stairs during ep 1 and the pics her picture book. This makes her somewhat more interesting, too bad it was never elaborated upon. Her apathy to things going on around her is fucking hilarious. Also, her gentle smile at the end of the OP animation totally got me.\\n\r\n- ODAGIRI SECOND BEST BITCH because she received considerable development and has more depth than the other Bitches. If there\u2019s a best there\u2019s gotta be a second best and no one else is more deserving of this than her I guess. They see her triangle-in' they hatin'.\\n\\n\r\nOther Bitches and Hoes include:\\n\r\n- Bitch who talks so much without even talking, why are women so noisy?\\n\r\n- Bitch who can see your miserable future\\n\r\n- Bitch who can see your fetishes because she can touch your heart (lol wut)\\n\r\n- Bitch who can turn invisible because fuck you and your peeping\\n\r\n- Bitch that I don't remember for some reason\\n\r\nThey don't stand out much from one another due to the lack of screentime because they were in the kitchen. They look gorgeous but sadly they have nothing else to offer but their voluptuous, inviting bodies. Heck there's even a Commando Bitch.\\n\\n\r\nApparently there are more dudes and Hoes, they were even of some importance but for sure I forgot about them as quickly as I forgot about high school notes after graduation. I can understand Miyamura being in the OP animation but that green-haired-dude-who-doesn\u2019t-swing-that-way-but I-forgot-his-name guy? Wtf was he doing there?\\n\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 8/10\\n\r\nY7 was so much better in many aspects than what I expected it to be, sadly it\u2019s a little bit underrated among the anime community.\\n\\n\r\nOur couple didn\u2019t kiss for real at the end do you know how much that destroyed my heart? What the fuck that\u2019s dumb as hell, writers stop being incompetent.

            "content": "My original review: http://pokemaster12.blogspot.com/2015/07/yamada-kun-and-seven-witches_25.html\r\nYamada-kun and the Seven Witches is probably one of my favorite anime of the previous season. Why? Well, it could be the fanservice. The fanservice they had was actually not as intrusive nor as obnoxious as some of the other anime to have come out recently. They had just enough that it was funny and flowed well with the story, but not enough that it destroyed the story itself. But then again, maybe it was the story that got me to love this anime.\r\nRyuu Yamada is a punk. He shows up at school late, sleeps in class, and doesn't do his homework.He finds his opposite in Urara Shiraishi, a beautiful girl whose the top student in school and always seen studying. One day when they're both walking up a flight of stairs, Yamada trips and they fall down. When he wakes up, Yamada discovers that he and Shiraishi have switched bodies. I find this basic premise to be incredibly interesting. It's hard to find original themes and ideas in the entertainment industry. However, while I'm sure this idea has been done before, I'll confess that it is the first time I've ever seen a story where a guy and girl swap bodies - and it's definitely the first time I've heard of two people swapping bodies from a kiss.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAside form having an intriguing premise, I absolutely love the characters in this story. Each of them feel like fully-fleshed out people, the kind you'd see walking down the street. They seem to have their own story to tell, and unlike most anime of this genre, they're not just caricatures of specific archetypes. Ryuu Yamada is a perfect example of this. He looks and acts like a punk, but as the story progresses, you see that he's actually a compassionate and caring person. He always puts others before himself, and does his best to help people even at great personal risk. He also makes a surprisingly good tsukkomi. Of course, my favorite character in all this would definitely have to be Urara Shiraishi. Aside from being downright gorgeously designed, I really enjoy her character. At first glance, she appears to be a kuudere type of girl; quiet, unobtrusive and studious. As the anime progresses you begin to learn more about her, and Shiraishi begins to change. While her original of being quiet remains mostly intact, her development as a person is more than obvious and truly a joy to watch happen.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLike all anime of the harem/romance/comedy variety, this one has its fanservice. Unlike most anime to have come out in recent years, however, the fanservice in Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches doesn't make me cringe. It's very light, giving you enough to laugh at and enjoy, but not so much that you feel like you're watching a hentai. It's funny and flows well with the story, but isn't overbearing. In other words, they have just the right amount of fanservice. A part of me wonders if the reason for this is because the writer/illustrator of the manga is actually a woman.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll this being said, if I had to name one reason why I like this anime over others, it would be the kissing. I feel like this anime is trying to make up for the lack of kisses in every other romance anime out there. I've watched a lot of anime with romance and only a few seem to actually have kissing in them. I don't know why this is, but Yamada-kun makes up for it by having several kisses pretty much every episode. I'll admit, the inner romantic in me squealed every time I saw Yamada and Shiraishi kiss. What's more, the ending left me completely fulfilled. This was one of the few romcom anime where I actually watched it all the way through to the end and felt utterly satisfied.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI think it is safe to say that everyone has a wish they want fulfilled. Money, power, and fame are the common ones, as they seem to be the most wanted. But money, power, and fame are not everything. More often than not, what we need most is not a shiny new car or rabid fans but instead something a bit more universal. A shoulder to lean on, a friend to hang out with, or a partner to hug; one of the greatest aspects in life are the relationships we share with the people around us.For it is these very relationships that do what those previous three wishes cannot: make us happy for a lifetime. Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches is all about relationships, wishes, and of course witches, that provides an average outing overall.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe Seven Witches (as it will be named from here on out) stars Yamada-kun, a delinquent whose behavior makes him very difficult to associate with. One day, when walking up some steps, he falls, crashing into the top student of the school, Urara Shiraishi, which magically causes their bodies to switch. From there, the quest to find the other six witches begins.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the anime\u2019s greatest strength comes in the form of the theme it tackles: the importance of relationships. Whether it is with friends, family, or anyone in-between, people are always looking to form a connection with those around them. This is the main point of the show, with the witch powers revolving around such a concept. For instance, Shiraishi is able to switch bodies because she always wanted to experience a different lifestyle, Nene is able to coerce others because she was looking to gain increased support, Maria can see the future in order to have others avoid terrible fates, etc. As the anime depicts, the girls have these abilities and use them on their fellow classmates not because they can but because they wanted to have everlasting relationships that they could not obtain otherwise. Scenarios like Noa dealing with some teenagers\u2019 hardships and Meiko working with students to perform better on their tests showcase the differing ways in which relationships are formed and comfort is found in others.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best and simplest examples of the show\u2019s emphasis on relationships that the anime employs is the kissing that is needed to use these witch powers. Kissing, be it on the hand, the cheek, or the lips, is a sign of affection towards another, and a known symbol of love between two people. Throughout the entirety of the anime, kissing is shared mostly between Yamada-kun and Shiraishi, but also between many more with gender being a second thought. Nobody thinks of it as anything more than a necessity until the end where Shiraishi clumsily goes through the act. She understands that now, after losing her power, the kiss\u2019s true meaning is all that is left.\\n\\n\r\nBut it took a lot to get to that moment; the girls, despite being granted amazing gifts, do not find immediate solace. In fact, while their status gave them interesting abilities, at the same time their powers actually prevented them from maintaining the relationships they so desperately wanted. Certain situations, such as Saionji\u2019s ability causing everyone to forget about her and Maria being unable to have a boyfriend, made it impossible to create such relationships. Worst still, those around them were affected, too; Yamada and Leona experience this firsthand through the loss they undergo. In this way, the conclusion of the anime \u2013 where the characters discover that it was not their powers that allowed them to all become such good friends but the experiences themselves \u2013 is a simple message that finishes the narrative nicely.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is one glaring issue that The Seven Witches has, known as \u201cfiring and forgetting.\u201d The anime follows usually the same sequence of events: learn of new witch, help this witch, and move on from said witch. There are minor discrepancies to this formula in the beginning (where the main group is being put together) and during one event in the middle (still dealing with forming the main group) but the show generally has the tendency to forego its most important aspect, namely the witches. Despite them all having interesting abilities, the anime refuses to use the girls in conjunction with one another or even after they have been discovered. This is strange because of the theme on relationships; one would think that, given the focus on it, such newfound relationships would play a more pivotal role in the scenarios encountered. Again, the non-witches are affected by this tactic as well because, after a certain point, cast members such as Miyamura and Miyabi are pushed to the side to make way for the anime\u2019s next set of occurrences.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOne of The Seven Witches weakest areas is the art it utilizes. In short, it is boring; besides the characters themselves not visiting too many locations outside of their clubroom or other parts of the school, there is little in the way of detail. At the minimum, the show does use some pretty hysterical reaction faces \u2013 usually performed by Yamada-kun \u2013 that have the eyes bug out as giant, white spheres that have lost their pupils. It sounds scary but it works to make Yamada-kun seem even more incredulous.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are very nice, especially for the female characters. While they tend to follow typical tropes for the medium \u2013 an uncommon hair and color combination \u2013 it fits with the uniqueness the girls have due to them being witches. Shiraishi\u2019s long blonde hair and jewel-like eyes, Nene\u2019s short purple hair, and Maria\u2019s earrings with pink hair and ponytail, with each wearing their school\u2019s uniform, is quite attractive. Yamada-kun\u2019s spiky blue hair and unkempt attire also coincides with his overall demeanor.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation is somewhere around average. There isn\u2019t a whole lot of action within the anime itself and therefore little movement. Lots of dialogue and sitting around is had instead, with the characters really only being animated when going through those all-important kisses.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nDue to the \u201cfiring and forgetting\u201d method used on the characters, many of the witches only have minor background details given about them. There is very little in the way of development because the show just does not give them any time whatsoever. This is evident in characters like Meiko and Noa who, after their specific episode, have nothing else about them provided. Other characters, like Miyabi and Ushio, undergo the same treatment of initial divulgence on their persons followed by a stagnation of their character. Nene at least garners a bit more attention in the form of (ironic) unrequited love, but it is nothing worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nTwo arguments arise as to why nearly the whole cast is little more than their personality traits: the comedic nature of the anime and the size of the cast. Since the show is more about inducing laughter than enacting drama, it becomes understandable that the characters are not entirely complex. Instead, by being only known for their individual shticks, the comedy is easier to handle and therefore present. As for the large cast size, the bigger it is, the more resources have to be spread evenly between everyone, devaluing each of the characters to a certain extent. That is, it becomes unrealistic to expect every cast member to be entirely fleshed out. This type of logic can be seen in most comedies involving a sizeable amount of characters, meaning them not being the most compelling of people is not too much of a negative.\\n\\n\r\nThe Seven Witches does put higher emphasis on two characters: Shiraishi and Yamada-kun. Shiraishi, as has been briefly described earlier, is the model student of the school. She is beautiful, gets great grades, and is respectful to those around her. Yet she has extreme difficulty connecting with others because many people are jealous of what she has, and for those that are not they cannot seem to understand the girl who hides behind her books. It is not until Yamada-kun shows up that she begins to open up. What is interesting is how the phrase \u201copposites attract\u201d both does and does not apply. She is like Yamada-kun because they both find themselves unable to connect with people and she is unlike Yamada-kun because of her passiveness compared to his active behavior. That last fact is a constant factor, with her mostly tagging along for the whole season. To that end, at times she feels nonexistent which in turn stagnates her character, but at the minimum she opens up more so than she ever did before.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Yamada-kun, he is arguably the strongest character the anime has to offer. Upon entering high school, he wanted to leave behind his old self in favor of a new one, but found that he once more could not find a place to call his own. It is at this point that Yamada-kun stumbles upon and on Shiraishi, with the rest of the season following. The further along it goes, the more situations he finds himself in and subsequently the more relationships he establishes with the people around him. He almost loses them forever, but his newfound determination fostered throughout the series pulls through, with him saving Shiraishi and the other witches with a wish that makes perfect sense; Yamada-kun already has everything he could ever wish for, so him unburdening the girls now and in the future to form their own relationships brings everyone the greatest amount of happiness. At this point, the reason for him having such a power to start with becomes clear: not only did he need friends and relationships the most out of anyone in the school but it was what he wanted more than anything all along. Meaning, he was granted all of the witch powers \u2013 which were designed to create these connections \u2013 to eventually achieve his wish, and achieve his true wish he did.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme starts and ends nicely, but the middle is rather repetitive. Listening to the piece more closely, the vocalist does nearly all of the work, while the instruments are composed in such a way as to bring about a mysterious yet hopeful vibe befitting the anime well enough. The ending theme mirrors its opening counterpart in that the singer does the heavy lifting; she has wonderful range and really carries the piece despite the boring beat.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the soundtrack is nothing too notable. There are tracks that follow the feeling of magic through their strange-sounding instruments, hard-guitar riffs for Yamada-kun\u2019s more rough-and-tumble encounters, piano melodies for the happy and sad times, and other tunes that find their place among the mystery that permeates many of the events. It is an OST that is not worth listening to outside of the anime itself, being little more than background noise.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for the anime is somewhere slightly above average. Special shout-outs are deserved for Ryota Osaka as Yamada-kun for his accent and reactionary way of speaking and Saori Hayami as Shiraishi for her \u201cmanlier\u201d way of speaking when Yamada-kun took over her body.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nLooking back through the anime, I found the first half or so pretty funny. Shiraishi was very cute, her interactions with Yamada-kun were always adorable, Miyabi and Miyamura were fun with their teasing, the body-switching created hilarious scenarios, and Nene\u2019s embarrassment despite her confidence made for quite the happy times.\\n\\n\r\nBut when the show moved away from its comedic roots and into the more dramatic elements later on, it started to fall apart. Due to the progression of the story, there were fewer cute moments between the main couple, the side characters were pushed to the sidelines, the powers were used less and less, and due to the shift in tone the anime was not looking to make Nene blush but instead have her cry. To put it differently, when the anime was trying to be funny, it was, and when it was not, it really should have been.\\n\\n\r\nThe point about not utilizing the witch powers to their full extent, talked about here and in other areas, was also sad to see. When the anime places so much importance on the witches that it includes them in the title itself, and then proceeds to not do anything with them, it doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense. It is even worse when the witches and their personalities added some spice to the mix. Noa\u2019s clinginess, Maria\u2019s assertiveness, and Meiko\u2019s dual personality were all quirks that the anime could have leveraged but failed to do so.\\n\\n\r\nYamada-kun and the Seven Witches has an interesting premise that ultimately does not go anywhere. Its themes are personable and some of its characters are interesting, but the misuse of its cast, the lackluster art, and the lame soundtrack bring the whole package down. While Yamada-kun and Shiraishi live happily ever after, this one still needs a wish of its own.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, theme on relationships is executed nicely but \u201cfiring and forgetting\u201d is rampant\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, boring art style, fitting reaction faces, nice character designs, about average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Nene and the side characters are passable, Shiraishi is okay, with Yamada-kun undoubtedly being a strong character\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, boring soundtrack, slightly above average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, Shiraishi is adorable, with the show being hilarious earlier rather than later\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

I loved the aura when they try to do a romantic mood with the lighting and the close up to there face and Yamada angry expression with the big vein in his forehead with dark black lines.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe voice acting for Yamada and Shiraishi is on point. They match how they are portrayed with Shiraishi shy low voice and Yamada loud voice. The background music enhances the mood that the story is trying to set.

            "content": "Powers are something that a lot of people wish to have in their lives.  The ability to do all sorts of neat tricks beyond the capabilities of humans like fly, read minds, and fire laser beams from your eyes are something that everyone thinks of having at least once in their lives.  But if you really got them, have you ever thought about the kind of impact they could have on your life?  Here, a review of Yamada-kun and the seven witches, a show that features seven individuals with a similar predicament.  \r\nStory (7.00/10): The story of Yamada-kun (that's the shorthandedway I'll be calling this series) follows the life of a delinquent individual by the name of Yamada Ryuu.  Feeling a little bit frustrated with boring life at school, he has a chance meeting with one of the school's top students, Shirashi Urara, on a flight of stairs, where he accidentally trips and knocks them both to the base of the steps.  It is discovered a little later on that the two characters have now switched bodies all of a sudden through the method of a kiss (you can probably guess what Yamada did now that he was in a girl's body.), sending the two on a journey where they find the seven witches, six other individuals who have the same kind of mystical power.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Yamada-kun for the most part bases itself around a witch of the week style of storytelling, where every episode/few episodes are centered around one particular witch, then move onto the next one, until the series's ends.  Within each of these stories, Yamada is faced with a different problem, a situation that each witch needs to have resolved before they are able to live happily on account of their powers acting both as a blessing and a curse.  With this, the show provides character development for our main protagonist in particular, as he slowly begins to think otherwise of his \"boring school life\" and begins to appreciate and enjoy what he has built up, thinking about others rather than himself.  (It's a nice progression.)  \\n\\n\r\nAlso, because this series revolves around the idea of witch powers that are used/exchanged through the art of kissing people, no matter what kind of fan you are, whether it's yaoi, yuri, or vanilla, you'll be finding something you'll like.  (Service for everyone!!!)\\n\\n\r\nBut here's the biggest issue I have with this series.  This anime features the story of the \"first witches arc\" in the manga, the first major arc of the series that takes up about 90 or so chapters to fill up, 90 very detailed and well written chapters.  As such, the anime takes a couple liberties to try and finish this arc within the small 12 episode timeframe.  This for me is a major flaw.  The reason for this is mostly to blame on the pacing, and how rushed this show is.  Because of its small timeframe, the show gets rid of quite a lot of important details to the storytelling, leaving the show to really just be the bare backbone of the original Yamada-kun story.  The events of the show are shown very quickly, before going into an awkward timeskip in order to go to move the story along.  As a result of this, the characters' actions don't really have a greatly significant effect as they could've, and some points in general are just thrown out the window.  \\n\\n\r\nBut in the end, Yamada-kun is a story that was in the end still enjoyable to watch.  While it missed a lot of important details within its storytelling, you'll still get a general gist of what is going on even without those little bits of information.  They'll be several cohesion problems as to why this specific action works to the characters' advantage, or why this character suddenly has a change of heart, but if you don't let the nitty gritty parts bother you that much, then all will be good.  Sadly though, this is still a case of \"the manga is better than the anime\" so keep that in mind if you prefer to watch it rather than read.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good story idea \\n\r\n+ Character development\\n\r\n+ Literally EVERYONE kisses each other (That to me is hilarious)\\n\r\n-  Rushed pacing\\n\r\n-  A horrendous amount of missing plot details\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.44/10): Similarly, the characters in Yamada-kun have a problem identical to the problem that the story had.  The characters are great, but at the same time, a lot of them just don't have the same kind of impact.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Yamada-kun himself, the protagonist of this fine little story.  As a \"delinquent\" style character, Yamada is a very brash and loudmouthed character, always speaking in an angry sounding tone and frustrated by when things don't go the way he feels they should.  While hard looking on the outside, Yamada's actually a bit softie, going out of his way to help the witches with their problems using his own power in the process.  His development for the most part comes from him helping each witch in the series one by one, as he throws himself in the line of fire to help protect and help these girls that are dealing with their own personal issues.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then, we have Shirashi Urara, the main female protagonist of the series.  Shirashi is a very calm girl, someone who is very willing to do what is needed in order to help the situation and is never panicked whenever she is face with a problem.  As such, she serves as an aid to help with whatever problem that Yamada is trying to resolve and helps the series' progression overall.  As a witch herself, she has a problem similar to the other six in the series, which, with the help of Yamada gets resolved and in the end, helps better her life.  \\n\\n\r\nThe side cast for Yamada is split off into two categories, the witches themselves, and the \"witch hunters\" as I call them, aka all the other characters in the series.  As for the witches, these characters are the centralized part of the story, utilizing most of the runtime in order to tell their problem, and have Yamada attempt to resolve it for them.  What I like about these girls is the fact that all of them have a look of progression with them, meaning that from the start of their story to the end, there is a significant change in most of them (since Asuka's a bitch...) and as a result, they all gain development and change towards their character.  As for the witch hunters, they vary in terms of importance.  Because it follows the story of the original manga, several rather important characters show up a lot later in the series on account of arc importance.  The issue with this is the fact that because they are delivered to us so late, they don't really get much importance or screentime as much as they should.  As a result a couple of them lack a proper character and the rushed feeling of the series is prominent with them.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good main cast\\n\r\n+ Central characters get character development\\n\r\n-  Most of the side cast are lackluster in terms of importance and/or development\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.00/10 and 8.10/10): The art for Yamada-kun was strictly made by LIDENFILMS.  The art for the series is a very light style, with the color palette of the series going towards a very white/light part of the spectrum.  As a result, the series is very whimsical looking and very bright.  The art for the series is what I would consider to be slightly above standard fare, as the quality for the series never seems to dip, and the overall look of the show is always very good looking with no glaring oddities and problems that I see.  Of course, it's not overly extraordinary, as they don't consistently have examples of outstanding animation, but it is still a very good look for the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the art for the series has a bit of a comedic feel to it, with the series using exaggerated facial expressions for the characters, which brings a bit more life into the series and a nice bit of comedy that I personally feel fits with the show.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, the OP for this series is one I personally find to be both fantastic, and very memorable.  It has a very original sound to it with its very flourishing sounds and bright tone which I personally find to be both enjoyable and something that I would want to listen to over and over again.  As for the ED, I personally don't find it to really be anything of any consideration.  It's nice, but it's a bit too generic for my taste, and it just doesn't seem to be all that memorable.  The rest of the soundtrack also falls into this category.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I have to give credit to the seiyuus for giving a great performance, since this series is one that requires one to play several roles on account of the characters in the series body switching and having to talk in more ways than one.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good quality art\\n\r\n+ Great sounding OP\\n\r\n-  Rest of the soundtrack is a bit lackluster\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (7.48/10): While Yamada-kun is a series I feel is a great and well written, this anime adaptation simply just didn't pull off the best execution that I had originally expected.  While we did get a good start to the series with its first three episodes, the rest just felt a bit disappointing as it started to rush towards the finish.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nContrary to what I have been saying, Yamada-kun is indeed a series that I still did enjoy.  It was nice to see the series in animated form and I was pleased to see not only the characters, but the scenes that I enjoyed reading.  I thought the seiyuus did a wonderful job in their voice acting on account of having to basically play multiple parts, and I really liked the aesthetics and the opening.  (This opening is probably one of the better ones this season.)\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nIt was rushed, plain and simple.  Because the show wanted to finish a huge story arc in the span of 12 episodes, the enjoyment factor dipped significantly.  While yes, I have read the Yamada-kun manga, I was wondering for the majority of the time as to how the characters in the series came up with a conclusion or how they were able to do this.  I knew how, but seeing from the perspective of someone new to the series, I just didn't see how it would really make sense to come to this conclusion the characters needing to do something in order to come to this resolution.  There were important details, entire mini story arcs in fact, that were missing from this adaptation, and I really wasn't happy with how the show took far too many liberties in order to finish where they wanted it to be.  Kind of wish there was more runtime so that things could be fleshed out a little bit more.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I would still say that Yamada-kun is still a decent adaptation.  While it did miss a lot of things that I would say are essential to the story's explanation, the overall adaptation is still the bare backbone of the Yamada-kun story and as such, is still relatively good in the fact that you still get the general idea of the story and should have a rather enjoyable time watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.50/10",

            "content": "Yamada-kun to 7-nin no majo aka Yamada and the 7 witches. i originally did not even notice this anime and wasn't gonna watch it i thought it was gonna be just meh and boy did i judge a book by its cover it was so under the radar for me that i consider it underrated also the best anime of the season in my personal opinion. If i had one major issue it would be the pacing it was a little fast.\r\nStory- I would have liked the anime to be longer but it definitely got to everything it needed in terms of the 7 witchesstory.The setting is within the school premises for the most part and the story consists of a guy who is a delinquent who ends up accidentally trips from a flight of stairs on to a girl who is the best student in the school they end up kissing during the fall and then they body swap during the exchange and later on realize that the kiss triggered the body switch so fast forward they revive an old club and the club that is for finding the 7 witches and the wacky funny dramatic journey begins.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance it may not seem very exciting and enticing but its interesting and as you get into the story you realize the burdens the witches face because of the powers they possess and you also get just so much weird wacky moments overall the story really stood out compared to everything i have watched this anime season.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Colorful real shiny overall its just something really good that honestly it sticks out the drawings may not be wow but mixed with everything the vibrancy if the colors the rainy scenes it was just really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound- not much to say everything fits within the anime it has an awesome opening and intro one of the best in the season imo and also has a decent ending. Character voices match the characters and the ost is fitting to say the most good overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- In terms of characters you get the 7 witches of course the 2 witch ******* and the student council along with some other characters you get an decent amount of characters that actually contribute to the story and you also get a crap load of character development within the 7 witches for their specific episodes once they are found and also get alot of development through the leading male character the witches powers creates for some funny moments and dramatic moments and pasts that  you might relate to irl or just sympathize with. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10 like i said my personal favorite and best anime ive seen this season in terms of everything including other seasons of anime from b4.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10 was it perfect? no but it was really good. Was it satisfying? Yes it was but i would have liked to seen more but the ending was a perfect fit to end the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe adaptation from the manga (never read will start reading) to the anime form wasn't good because based on opinions from the manga readers it is completely different but one thing ive noticed amongst the manga readers are that the anime even though it doesn't follow the manga it is still great on its own. My anime of the season is Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo (TV).",

            "content": "Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches was definitely one of the better anime of the Spring season. While the concept of supernatural elements in a school setting and body switching isn't exactly new, this series was able to pull them off in an entertaining and interesting way nonetheless.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story revolves around the seemingly mean-spirited delinquent, Ryuu Yamada, and his complete polar opposite, Urara Shiraishi. The two students take an unexpected tumble down their school's stairs and end up kissing by accident, which causes them to magically switch bodies. When they discover that kissing is what triggers the strange phenomenon, another student discovers their little secretand convinces them to help him revive the Supernatural Studies Club in order to find other girls with strange powers. While the plot itself isn't the best or original, it was still fairly interesting. The pacing was overall okay, and it never felt too slow or dragged out. The ending wrapped up problems satisfyingly enough even though it was predictable. Overall, I have no major complaints with the story even if it had some minor flaws.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art and backgrounds are colorful, vibrant, and overall well-drawn. It was nice and seemed to have a sense of effort put in. I thought the character designs were appealing and charming enough. The animation was decent, and it got the job done without any major flaws or hiccups. I never noticed a dip in quality and it stayed consistent all throughout. As a newer anime, the art and animation was definitely well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music was pretty good. I definitely enjoyed listening to the super catchy and upbeat opening every week. The ending wasn't that bad either. The background music was pretty standard and not particularly noteworthy, but it did fit the tone of most of the scenes well enough. All the Japanese voice actors were great. I especially liked how they changed their voices whenever a certain character swapped into someone else's body.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThere are a slew of characters and the majority of them were likeable, interesting, and their backstories fleshed out okay enough to actually care about them. Most of the focus is on Yamada and how he helps each witch from whatever complication they are facing and their eventual involvement with the group. I thought the romantic relationship between Yamada and Shiraishi was executed fairly well. It didn't feel forced or anything. Unfortunately, one lacking aspect I did notice was that most of the side characters aren't fully developed due to the large cast size and time restraints. I felt we only got to see a part of it as it doesn't go as in depth with them. That said, each character had a purpose that helped push the plot along, so no character felt useless. It was also really enjoyable to see the characters in the many comedic situations due to all the body swapping and other supernatural abilities of the witches. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI quite enjoyed watching Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches. It was a funny, interesting, and fun watch. The series was mostly a lighthearted comedy, but it did sometimes get a little bit more serious when it came to the more dramatic parts revolving around the character conflicts. That helped keep things interesting. If you go in and watch the series for what it is, you most likely won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nYamada-kun exceeded my expectations and it was one of the more interesting series of the season. The comedy was on point, the romance was believable, the characters were solid, and the story played out satsfyingly enough. It wasn't perfect, but it nonetheless has more than enough merits and positive aspects that makes it a decent watch. If you're looking for a supernatural rom-com, then I recommend giving this series a try.",

The main character (Yamada) is your average school delinquent who accidentally discovers that he could switch bodies with another person by the act of kissing them by the lips. Or so he thought..\r\nHe later discovers that there are 7 other people who have \"powers\" within the school, hence the name of the anime. I'll stop talking about the plot now, the rest is up to you to see for yourself.\r\nI feel that there were some parts where you could see what was going to happen and the ending was very cliche (imo), howeverthe story made me keep anticipating for the next episode. Overall I would recommend this anime, it has a nicely mixed harem/romance/comedy feel to it, and I enjoyed it a lot myself.",

            "content": "Short:\r\nThe anime felt very rushed compared to the manga. Everyone seems to instantly respond to every action, thus losing much of the impact and emotion between exchanges. Some of the manga parts seemed to be added in just because it was in the manga, except some of the preludes were completely skipped which made it seemed very forced. Overall, I didn't really like this adaptation as it felt more like a summary of the manga than an actual fully fleshed anime.\r\n*Spoilers Ahead*\r\nStory: 7\r\nThis comes from the fact that we seem to be missing a few chunks of the story here and there probably due tothe episode limitations. The whole searching for witches and yamada's reasons felt very superficial where he does things just because the story needs him as the protagonist, rather than him having actual reasons.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9:\\n\r\nI felt that the art truly reflected the original's, not to mention that I feel it's actually a bit better. Miki (the author/artist) occasionally had some issues with the art, which I didn't notice here.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8:\\n\r\nDidn't really like the OP or ED songs. The voice selections suited their characters, though maybe the president could have been someone different, not really sure who, but I felt that his voice didn't really suit the character. For BGM, there wasn't much that caught my attention.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6:\\n\r\nLike stated earlier, everything just felt rushed. Their characters don't really feel fleshed out and everything they do don't really coincide with their character because we weren't given enough information beforehand (e.g. Miyamura's sister was actually a secret he wanted to keep but just stated it to everyone without much of an issue). I really felt that they should have adapted less of the manga and do each episode more thoroughly. \\n\r\n--Example 1: Yamada refuses to rejoin the Supernatural Club because he believes they're better off without him, but this isn't actually explained in the anime.\\n\r\n--Example 2; Yamada also runs through a few thoughts before confessing to Shiraishi but this is skipped in the anime for some reason, which makes the confession really random/abrupt.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nIt wasn't as enjoyable as the manga as everything happened way too quick without much time for people to really grasp the mood. It really felt like we were just skipping from scene to scene and being fed the main points of each scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7:\\n\r\nFirst anime I've watched where I've read the manga beforehand, so maybe I'm being a bit harsh. But it was definitely less enjoyable watching the anime than it was reading the manga. There was a real lack of romantic atmosphere between Yamada and Urara kissing. Perhaps even the voice acting was a bit rushed. Overall, I think there really should have been a few moments where each important character could engage in a short thought monologue.",

            "content": "A great anime I discovered not later than yesterday.\r\nIt basically is a mix between high-school / romance / harem / fantasy-magic themes, but the main theme which shines remains love. \r\nI won't sum up the story but just give my own appreciation. Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo has an original story but its best part is surely the character's development and the way they make everybody attractive (in the meaning of 'I wanna know more about him / her'). Sadly but logically, only the main characters (count Yamada, Shiraishi, Miyamura, Itou & Nene later on) will be on the front of the scene. Talking aboutthat, the last 2 witches' background remained really unknown, compared to the other ones.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, the other witches will have their dedicated episode (full duration, fortunately) but some won't be seen before the final episode, or at least, seen for a second in any other one. I can't blame this choice because an episode only takes 24-25 minutes but still, I would have appreciated to see them again, to learn more about everyone. Even though, I can't say there is a lack of information of those, concerning the main part of their background (aka, how did every witch get her power). \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, it is a very good entertainment, mixed with both magic and realistic context... but when you think about it slowly, you can easily guess it could happen to anyone on Earth. To make it quick, every witch gains her power once she falls in a quite sad situation. For example, one wanted to be involved in groups, in a highschool regular life but couldn't, so she gained the power seduce anyone. In that way, she gained 'friends' (more like servants) and was able to become more important.\\n\\n\r\nBut once we learn this part, we kinda feel sad for her, 'cause she was desperate. This is surely the routine of many students, no matter the age. You can only have empathy for all the witches, knowing that. The ending was really satisfying, considering it puts an end to a sad situation (in fact, everybody finishes friend with everybody and we can consider no one else inside the group will end up alone).\\n\\n\r\nSo, I recommend this anime for its plot and the very good development of characters. But don't forget that even if it is only an invented story, it also represents the daily life of many people around the world, and they don't have magic powers to help themselves. All the witches are kinda left alone, either because of their inability to speak with strangers or because other people can really tough, especially with younger than 'em. So give a hand whenever you see someone in the same situations, eh !",

            "content": "TL;DR: Rushed as f*ck.\r\nNo spoilers here.\r\nYamada-kun and the 7 Witches was one of the anime that I was dreading this season. Why? Because it was one-cour. The story arc that could be concluded with the manga as it is now is either over 80 chapters in or an original ending, and with the sweet spot of manga to anime adaptation being 2-3 chapters an episode, 80 could be a little too much in 24 episodes, even if filler is cut. Well, for better and for worse, Yamada-kun met and exceeded my expectations.\r\nBut let\u2019s talk about the good stuff first.\r\nYamada-kun and the 7 Witches (which Iwill abbreviate as 7 Witches) follows the titular Ryu Yamada, a second year delinquent who is all alone in a rather prestigious school. When walking up the stairs threateningly near the class genius and beauty, the diminutive Urara Shiraishi, he accidentally falls down the stairs on top of her. To their extreme surprise, they switched bodies. After walking in each other shoes, Yamada realizes Shiraishi is being bullied and, against her will, helps put an end to it. They then discover they can switch back by kissing. Subsequently, Yamada and Shiraishi get embroiled within the contest for Student Council President, create the Supernatural Studies Club, and search for the 7 Witches, who have powers similar to body-swapping.\\n\\n\r\nPremise aside, 7 Witches\u2019 key strengths are its art and extremely ball-busting humor, drawing from ecchi, physical, character-driven, and wordplay based humor. The anime always succeeds here. Linden does a tremendous job in animating here, making the environments of Suzaku High School seem especially grand and high-class. Many girls have extremely strange hair colors (green, blue, pink, whatever), and while they appear strange in the manga, Linden does a pretty good job at making them seem less jarring in the anime. Facial expressions are rendered extremely carefully, elevating the humor, which is usually done right. Aside from kissing, there is some playful fanservice here, and while it does get grating, the anime, in adapting, skips out on some of the fanservice as well, which is actually a plus, especially for those who are averse to such elements.\\n\\n\r\nThe true star of this entire anime is by far the voice work. I have to give amazing credit to the characters who generally swap bodies: Ryota Ohsaka (Yamada), Saori Hayami (Shiraishi), Toshiki Masuda (Toranosuke Miyamura) and Maaya Uchida (Miyabi Ito). When the characters swap bodies, each voice actor immediately switches their delivery to match the personality currently inhabiting their character. Hayami, who typically does quitter or gentler female roles, becomes bombastic and crude when Yamada is in Shiraishi\u2019s body. Similarly, whenever Shiraishi inhabits Yamada, Ohsaka delivers in a very terse and gentle tone. Masuda and Uchida also do a splendid job when body swapping is going on, but Ohsaka and Hayami are, without question, amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the voice cast does an amazing job, because 7 Witches\u2019 voice cast is stacked. To single out some of the biggest names here, Eri Kitamura voices Nene Odagiri, Aoi Yuki voices Noa Takigawa, Kana Hanazawa voices Mikoto Asuka, Daisuke Ono voices Ushio Igarashi, Miyuki Sawashiro voices Leona Miyamura, and Jun Fukuyama voices Student Council President Haruma Yamazaki. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where the praise stops, because Linden decided to make this one-cour instead of two.\\n\\n\r\nThe original 7 Witches manga had some filler that could have been taken out without too much trouble. A subplot with the girls\u2019 archery club president, Karen Kimishima, was cut out, and ultimately, that does not matter. Some arcs could be cut a little shorter without too much trouble, such as the arc focusing around Maria Sarushima or the arc surrounding Noa. But 7 Witches wasn\u2019t filled with so much fluff to be able to cut much more than this, so the amount of corner-cutting when it comes to plot make certain developments jarring and eliminates the impact of some of the arcs.  \\n\r\n(Some subtle foreshadowing sprinkled within the early chapters that reference the ongoing arc in the manga are cut entirely, so if that\u2019s ever adapted, it will seem less clever and more out of left field.)\\n\\n\r\nThe final arc of the anime was a rushed and hollow shadow of what was in the manga, which is a severe disappointment. Due to this corner cutting, all characters other than Yamada (and to a much lesser extent, Shiraishi) that had character development don\u2019t have any. Admittedly, some characters don\u2019t have much character development still don\u2019t, like Ito, Kentaro Tsubaki, and a couple of the witches. However, other characters lose both their motivations and screentime, making them hollow shells of people and not actual characters. The best way to describe this is in quick list form.\\n\\n\r\n-Shiraishi loses her dry, cutting humor, making her more generic.\\n\r\n-Toranosuke Miyamura\u2019s motivation in the manga doesn\u2019t exist in the anime.\\n\r\n-Leona Miyamura\u2019s motivation is heavily watered down.\\n\r\n-Odagiri\u2019s, Ushio\u2019s, Noa\u2019s, and Yamazaki\u2019s cut scenes make them more one-dimensional in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nYamada is pretty much the only major character to come through the adaptation unscathed, but with the other characters being rather weak, it prevents the anime from being a good adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nMany adaptations come in too soon and have to rush or make an original ending. This was not that. Linden\u2019s rushed 12 episode adaptation of Yamada made it lose most of its plot and character based strengths. More than a faithful retelling, it often feels like a highlights reel of the plot. The presentation is beyond stellar, but when the plot and characters are diluted to such an extent, it\u2019s hard to be happy with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5 (premise is OK to begin with, anime cuts down on many strengths)\\n\r\nArt - 8 (beautiful animation)\\n\r\nSound - 9 (music is forgettable but the voice acting is amazing)\\n\r\nCharacter - 5 (all characters except Yamada are hollow)\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4 (as a manga lover, this rushed adaptation hurts)\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6.2 (rounded to 6)\\n\\n\r\nEdit 7/6/15: Decided my score was a tad reactionary.\\n",

            "content": "In terms of an Honest review , This anime is pretty good , at first i thought it would be Alot of \" Ecchi/Harem\"Type of  aspect in this anime  Judging it based on the english translation which is Yamada-kun and the seven witches . However, that is not the case as this anime has real potential on how the characters are developing and how the story is progressing as the series goes by.\r\nThe negative thing about the anime is Body-swapping , Body-swapping in anime usually means one thing, and that\u2019s fanservice. I\u2019m not the world\u2019s biggest fanservice devotee. Fanservice can devour an anime\u2019splot and turn a show gross and mean in a heartbeat. In the worst cases, fanservice turns otherwise interesting characters into inauthentic caricatures of themselves, all in pursuit of the almighty panty shot.\\n\\n\r\nBut, I am happy to say that the first two volumes of Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches, at least so far, is just as good as people make it out to be; that\u2019s a really big surprise, considering how a title like this could easily go wrong and end up a shallow fanservice style story. Yamada-kun is a very funny manga with a lot of heart and character that really all comes together in just the right way. There are flaws certainly, but the positives more than adequately outweigh the negatives.\\n\\n\r\nI have also watched the Last episode when it came out and i must say it ended pretty damn good for the first season which i will not spoil. Will see how the story progresses from there and will do another review on the next season?:P\\n\\n\r\nPositive thing which is really good about the anime is the :\\n\r\nOpening\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nArt & Character\\n\\n\r\nStory sometimes can get off plot if you watch the anime you will know what i mean by this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S Please actually read the review throughly before \"Pressing the unhelpful\" button lol",

            "content": "My first experience with Yamada-Kun to 7-nin no Majo was with the manga. Seeing it as one of the popular ones, and my favorite tags of comedy, school life and romance, I decided I would give it a whirl. Immediately hooked, I read about 50 chapters before stopping to go to sleep. However, after that, I was bogged down with school work and the like and I never got around to continuing it. I didn't have time for anime or manga at that point and went on about a 4 month break. However, recently the stars aligned and summer started and I had time towatch. So with all the episodes out, I decided to binge the entire thing and be done with it, even if it isn't as good as the manga. So without further ado, here's my review of Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nThe story isn't unique, nor is it a masterpiece. However, it has its merits. The school romcom genre is already well established, and it isn't the first time that we've seen one mixed with supernatural. It also isn't the first time that we've seen an anime centered around kissing. And the characters in the harem (my opinion, others think that harem isn't correct) aren't the most unique either. But I can get to that later. The story, with only information from the title and the first episode, is centered around  our male protagonist, Yamada Ryu, the delinquent of the school. Upon his introduction, we are also introduced to Shiraishi Urara, whom I consider the female protagonist. Unlike Yamada, who is a violent, lazy delinquent, Shiraishi could be described as the ideal student: quiet, studious, and attractive. In essence, they are polar opposites. The plot arises when Yamada walks up the stairs and pushes Shiraishi aside. While doing so, they both trip and fall down the stairs. After blacking out, Yamada wakes up in the infirmary, only to realize that he is now in Shiraishi's body instead of his own. After some time, they realize that switching bodies is achieved through a kiss. Based on the title, we can assume that there are 7 witches, each with their own power. The strength in the story isn't the plot itself, but the execution of it. While the plot is certainly interesting, it's nothing we haven't seen before. However, the way it is executed is what sets it apart. The anime doesn't take itself overly seriously. It knows when it should be a lighthearted comedy, and it knows when to be a more serious, supernatural mystery story. Overall, the plot is interesting and is delivered well, but is no masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nNow I dabble a bit in drawing manga style characters, but I'm no judge of great art. However, even I can tell that this series looks good. Many of the backgrounds are well drawn, and the colors are typically bright and pop out. But the main point of this art score is the character design. The characters are all designed uniquely and are easily differentiated from each other. All the characters are designed in a way that makes them hard to forget, and they are all unique from the other students to signify their importance to the story. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nFor me, the soundtrack was for the most part good but forgettable. I wouldn't mind listening to the soundtrack while watching, but I wouldn't go out of my way to listen to it again. So you would think that sound would be a bit lower, and honestly, I would put it around 5 or 6. However, the OP and ED are extremely catchy, and for those alone, I put sound at 7. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nAs I said before, the characters aren't exactly original. You've got the tsundere, the kuudere, the loli, the older sister, etc. etc. However, for the most part, they are fairly likeable and undergo some form of development. Because the series is condensed into 12 episodes, the development happens much faster and sometimes feels awkward and forced. The only two witches who I think get any sort of notable development are Shiraishi Urara and Odagiri Nene, who is personally my favorite of the bunch. For the rest, their motives are typically defined by a single point, which is often just given rather than explained. As such, the characters are fun, but typically lack depth outside of this one point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI try not to be the biggest critic, and there are merits to this anime. While there are flaws, if you go in with the right expectations and try not to think too much while watching, you'll come out most likely happy and satisfied. The ending resolves most of the problems, even though I could literally see it coming a mile away. Sure, it's predictable and cliche, but there is a lot of fun to be had here. Take it for what it is: a fun, supernatural romcom with a sprinkling of story. If you expect more from it, you will likely end up disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nYamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo was a fun watch and had me laughing at times. It was a good experience, and I can happily say that it is most likely worth your time. It's no masterpiece, but then again, most shows aren't. It ranks fairly highly among my recently watched anime, even though I haven't watched that many recently. If you need a deep, plot driven drama, then this isn't for you. However, if you need a lighthearted romcom with supernatural elements, check out Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo. You won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n~Thanks for reading my review! I'm still fairly new to this whole writing reviews business, so any advice or tips is entirely welcome. Also, rating helpful or not would be, well, helpful for me to see if I'm writing these correctly. If someone wants to talk anime with me, feel free to message me. I'm typically online at least a few times a week.~",

            "content": "Ever imagined being someone else? That idea may have come across your mind sometime in your life. No really, I\u2019m sure almost everyone at least had that thought once in their lifetime. So what happens when there\u2019s a case of body swapping and you become a person of the opposite gender? I think that would be very peculiar experience. Yamada-kun to 7-in no Majo (Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches) operates under circumstances where two main characters changes their bodies and well, you can guess from here that all sort of drama comes rolling.\r\nThe series is adapted from the manga of the same name that runsfor over 160+ chapters and is still ongoing. Directed by Takuno Seiki, the show is a hit or miss. The hit part could be the comedy as the show really likes to play around a lot with itself. That\u2019s because the body switching gimmick isn\u2019t the only concept explored in this series. If you read the title, you\u2019ll notice the word, \u201cwitches\u201d. In a nutshell, there should be expectations that other sorts of magical or supernatural phenomenon will propel itself into the story. And that\u2019s not an understatement. The miss part would be the storytelling. Before the series debuted, it was announced that the series would only be adapted into a 1 cour span of (12 episodes). It\u2019s not a split cour, not a 2 cour, and definitely not a good piece of news to remember in mind. \\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake. The series takes off pretty quick as the pilot episode establishes the body switching gimmick quickly without wasting time. No more than 10 minutes into the series and you\u2019ll see a guy (Yamada) staring into the mirror and realizes that he no longer has \u201cit\u201d. On the other hand, there\u2019s the smart and beautiful Uraha Shiraishi who is now in the body of a delinquent. This all happened by a coincidental event when they landed on each other off a flight of stairs. While this all seems troublesome, they do discover that reversing the effect involves a kiss. This also revives the Supernatural Studies Club, a group of students dedicated in studying supernatural phenomenon. By this point, I think you can get adjusted to the idea of the show. It\u2019s one of those series that really likes to play around with itself from the very beginning. In fact, almost every episode features some sort of unusual circumstance that ends up causing a lot of drama for the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs a club composed of several members, the series gives the audience some insight on them. The titular character Ryu Yamada is easily noticeable for his delinquent-like traits and personality. Throughout the series, we see him as guy that uses his fist to do the talking although he does care quite a lot about his friends. Uraha is more of a polar opposite. Smart, beautiful, and stoic in a way, she often keeps to herself and is often thinks before she acts. The way the show formulates their relationship at first almost feels like it\u2019s on auto-pilot. Since neither character are similar, they have to learn more about each other. In the story, we see how that progresses with each episode. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t say that their relationship is really believable. While some series can easily capture the audience\u2019s attention with polar opposite characters, this one just ticks a bit way too much with the comedy. Not to mention, we have the kissing part that is used as a plot device. The romance aspect of it feels forced and quickly rushed without developing much for our characters. However, I do have to say that the chemistry between Yamada and Uraha can be surprisingly charming. There\u2019s a genuine mutual respect and feeling the two share as we can easily see that later on in the show. As for the other characters, we have Toranosuke Miyamura who serves more as a middleman, Miyabi Ito with her fascination of supernatural phenomenon, and Kentaro Tsubaki who happens to have a crush on Uraha. While not as prominent as Yamada and Uraha, they do play some key roles in the series. Unfortunately, some of them can be easily forgettable after first impressions.\\n\\n\r\nThen, there are the witches. There\u2019s seven of them including Uraha. The series early on establishes the fact that all of them have a different power. We don\u2019t know most of their powers or how they work until the witches reveal themselves. And as a 1 cour series, the show tries to seize every opportunity to capture that point. However, this is a really sour attempt to get screen time for them. The way the witches are introduced may leave some good first impressions but overall lacks development. Sure, some of them even get a decent characterization but by adaptation standards, too much is left out. The structure of the show suffers a lot from cramming and some episodes even takes a lot to get their own stories started. Also, relationship dynamics are played more for comedy so it\u2019s hard to take it seriously. On the plus side, I have to give some credit to the clever powers that the series introduces. Each witch has a different power and all of them can create some rather entertaining storytelling. Additionally, each of the witches has different personalities so the story does feel a bit refreshing with such a direction.\\n\\n\r\nDespite having a lot of character and story pacing issues, one major aspect of the show that can win its audience over may be the comedy. The series isn\u2019t a parody of witches but it can be genuinely funny. Yamada is a character that acts often in brash manners so his actions will definitely provoke some laughter if you see the trouble he gets himself into. Then, there are the powers. The concept of body swapping itself can be amusing to think about especially if a guy becomes a hot girl. Some of the other powers are troublesome but the show itself plays each gimmick cleverly to adapt with the developing story. There are also tons of kissing and although most series today makes it a highlight point between character relationships, this series does it casually and seems to be even self-aware. In general, comedy portrayal is a highlight and can be appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork in general is generic yet works well. The character designs is what is attractive for the overall adaptation. The guys hardly stand out; well perhaps except Yamada. However, the girls really are designed with attractiveness such as Uraha. In particular, the witches are all noticeable in some way or form with their hairstyles, figures, and even status symbol. Despite taking place in the school setting, there\u2019s a load going on besides just in the classrooms. In essence, we see many places of the school explored with a fine degree of clever decorating. I also have to give some praise to the character expressions as it enhances the comedy aspect of the series overall.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I\u2019m not a big fan of the soundtrack, the series does know how to utilize them. As the series portrays a lot of comedy, it\u2019s important to capitalize on the atmosphere so the series makes use of more colorful OST. In most respects, it works well to get the viewers laughing. However, it\u2019s nothing outstanding in terms of quality as it\u2019s very standard. The OP and ED theme songs has a warm feeling to it though that is sung with a soft melancholic tone. But when it comes down to it, the characters\u2019 voice mannerism will probably win you over. Yamada is a key figure to notice with his commanding voice as he gets into a lot of troublesome circumstances. Indeed, the series has this ability to communicate its gimmicks with the voices of the characters. Whether it\u2019s the diverse voice mannerism of the witches, the Supernatural Club, or even the Student Council, it always seems to be noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nGender bender isn\u2019t a new concept used by the anime industry. Neither are witch powers, kissing, or a club that investigates unusual cases. Rather, I take this show as more of a comedy story with a bit of clever gimmicks thrown in at you on a weekly basis. The episodes themselves each tell a story with something that sticks with the overall theme of the series. Just note that by adaptation and storytelling standards, it doesn\u2019t shine well especially with the structure, rushing, and is easily predictable. On the plus side, the comedy really can bring some laughs. Ever had a bad day and you wanted something to laugh about? Perhaps this series can be what you\u2019re looking for. The series itself is like a personality.",

            "content": "At first, i didn't have any interest to this anime. I was just picking some random spring anime to watch. I really didn't have any big hope for this anime. But surprisingly, it was pretty good.\r\nStory : 8/10\r\nYamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo is a story about Ryuu Yamada, a second-year Suzaku High School student, who one day accidentally kiss a girl and later he finds out that he has Witch's power that is activated with a kiss. Beside Yamada, there are still other witches with various powers in the school to be encountered.\r\nThe story and the concept were kinda unique to me. As i wentthrough episodes, it became more interesting. In the middle episode of the anime, i started to read the manga. The adaption was really great. But like others said, it was rushed compared to the manga. They skipped and changed some scenes from the manga. Gladly they only skipped the minor parts, so it didn't really affect the storyline. The ending also was pretty good and well-executed, definitely it won't dissapoint you.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\r\nThe art was pretty nice. It's pretty colorful, the designs were great, the animations, backgrounds, etc. All were well-animated. Your eyes will enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound was also really good. The Background Sound fitted well with the scenes and situations. The seiyuus also did great job voicing the characters. The opening song was really great, it was nice to hear and pretty catchy, You won't even skip the opening song when the anime is played. The ending song was didn't really good, but still nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8/10\\n\r\nThe main characters led the story pretty good. They were well-developed. The characters were funny, cute and lovely. They had various, different & unique personalities, backgrounds, etc, made you interested enough to enjoy the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyments : 9/10\\n\r\nThis show really exceeded my expectations.  After finished one episode, i'd be curious what'll happen next and really excited for the upcoming episode. The show brings me enjoyments and satisfactions everytime i watch it. All i can say is i really love this show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8/10\\n\r\nAlthough the story was rushed, Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo still proved its qualities and is definitely a worth watching. For you who want a nice, fun to watch, heartwarming, and entertaining show, Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo is a must watch one.",

            "content": "When i first saw this anime i was very doubtful it would be good for two reasons:the description sounded like it would be boring though it did catch my eye haven't see an anime like this in a long while and i heard it was rushed.I heard like about 100 chapters worth of content was being crammed into 12 episodes which is absolutely ridiculous i thought there was no way it could be good however i was proven wrong from the first episode.Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo stands apart from the anime that have been coming out in recent seasons its not the best thingever but the whole body switching aspect glued me in on the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nStory:8 The story is about yamada who while going up the stairs switched bodies with a girl.After returning to his body and learning about witches,students at his school with special powers he sets out to find the other witches who all have different abilities which activate with a kiss.The story was pretty interesting i thoroughly enjoyed it.The story is very eye catching i mean a guy switching bodies with a kiss haven't seen that in a while.I typically don't enjoy gender bender anime all that much but this one i did because it wasn't just about switching bodies the past about other witches and their powers were flesh out.Though i felt the story at points felt rushed i still enjoyed it. \\n\\n\r\nArt:8 The art is pretty good,makes this anime look different from the other anime this season but it wasn't the greatest thing ever or the best this season but it was unique. \\n\\n\r\nSound:7 The sound was ok i liked the opening and ending though the music played throughout the series was kinda forgettable maybe just isn't my kind of music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7 I didn't like a lot of them at first but they grew on me over the series.Time was spent showing the back stories of the witches however it felt a little rushed at times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8 I enjoyed Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo a lot it was a good anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8 For an anime that adapted like 100 chapters into 12 episodes it did pretty good it felt rushed at times but i could still understand the story and didn't really feel that something was terribly missing however it would have been good to have more episodes to flesh out the characters more but for what it did it was good.This anime is different from the standard harem/romance anime.I didn't really feel like this was a harem anime and unlike most harems out there,there was romance progression.The main character didn't beat around the bush he was honest with his feelings and ended up with one girl at the end. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"All you wanted was a kiss, right?\" - Yamada\r\nArtwork and Animation: 7\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I believe this is LIDENFILMS' first solo anime production. From a cursory search, it seems they were also a 2nd on Arlsan Senki, also new this season. With that in mind, I have to say that this is a solid first outing for a new studio. The characters and backgrounds retain a consistent quality throughout, and while nothing was groundbreaking, it was very easy to watch. I never noticed any major dips in quality, and it moves fluidly. \r\nSound and Voice Acting: 9\r\nThe opening and ending themes arerather catchy, upbeat J Pop tunes. Listenable, and set the tone for a lighthearted romantic comedy such as this.\\n\r\nSaori Hayami (Hatoko, Inou Battle)  and Ryota Osaka head up the cast as Urara Shiraishi and Yamada-kun, and do a good job selling the quiet, cute girl, and the delinquent ruffian, respectively. \\n\r\nThe supporting cast usurps the spotlight some, though, with Eri Kitamura (Takagi, HOTD) as Nene Odagiri, Maaya Uchida (Rikka, Chuunibyou) as Itou Miyabi, and even All Hail Lelouch, Jun Fukuyama as the class president, Yamazaki. Overall a very good group of varied voices that give some personality to what may have otherwise been a real cookie cutter cast filling in blanks for a generic romcom harem show, which this is not. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and Story: 8, 6\\n\\n\r\nYamada-kun has a decently small cast for a show that promises at least 8 characters in the title. We're introduced to Yamada and his friend Miyamura, the student council VP (who start up the Supernatural Studies Club again) first. The group grows from there to include the hyperactive geeky girl Ito and the quiet beauty Shiraishi. After Yamada finds out that with a kiss, he and Shiraishi are able to change bodies Freaky Friday style, he learns that there are other girls causing trouble at school with odd \"powers\", such as a charming power, telepathy, the power to give nightmares, and others.\\n\\n\r\nTo further the issue, in order for Miyamura to get the nod from the current student council president to be the president's successor, he and Yamada, along with the Supernatural Studies Club are tasked with uncovering the identities of the seven \"Witches\" of Suzaku high school. However, Nene Odagiri, another candidate for the position, is also out to figure out the identity of these witches before Miyamura does. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, I thought that this really was just going to be the anime version of Freaky Friday, with Yamada and Shiraishi swapping bodies and causing all kinds of trouble for themselves that way, but to my pleasant surprise, Yamada-kun really switched it up and kept the show fresh. With the addition of the other witches and their powers, along with how they affected Yamada and his friends' personal lives, it really sewed the show up together nicely. \\n\\n\r\nThe nearly constant addition of new characters wasn't burdensome to try and keep track of- and it gave the show a somewhat episodic feel, while still furthering the main plot. Some of the supporting characters were as interesting to watch interact with and scheme against Yamada as watching the antics of Yamada himself. I personally enjoyed that the antagonistic characters stayed true to form, even when they reached the ends of their respective episodic arcs. The characters, while not necessarily unique, were definitely entertaining. My personal favorite was probably Nene Odagiri or Tempura boy who cooks when he gets depressed. \"ANYTHING BUT THE TEMPURA!\"\\n\\n\r\nThere are some of the typical tropes in Yamada-kun, like the unrequited love, and the misunderstood confessions/wrong place wrong time mishaps, but it takes these and runs with them, rather than trying to spoonfeed the viewer a trite romance show. The powers that the witches have provide a lot of fun situations, and the powers themselves were interesting in how they affected the plot and how the characters went about solving the problems they presented, and by proxy- the problems of the witch herself. The show is a nice little slice of life with a decent romance plot, and some magic thrown in for fun.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nYamada-kun was definitely the surprise of this season. I started watching it the week before the final episode aired, and I found that I was more anxious to watch the next episodes when they were all right in front of me way more than if I had to wait a week! I really enjoyed the fact that the harem and ecchi factors were at an absolute minimum. I never felt like I was being beat over the head with anyone's body, and when the mild nudity did arise- it was played off as a gag, and not made into a point of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance itself was also pretty believable, and heartfelt. I wasn't being told repeatedly that Yamada and the girl were in love, but rather shown. Show, not tell- and it worked here. Despite that I almost never enjoy romance shows, I found myself fairly invested in the show, especially at/after episode 10. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that I liked Yamada-kun a lot more than I thought I would when I read the premise. I'm no romance fan, and I couldn't care less about whatever the hot new ecchi harem is, but I had several recommendations for the show from other users here, and I have to admit, they were right about Yamada-kun. Definitely one of the best anime this season.",

            "content": "I'm glad I watched it, and, despite the fact that I absolutely loved it, this is one of the few times I'll say I'm glad there wont be a second season. The reason for this is because it's perfect as it is and I could only see more as detracting from the whole. If you're looking for a lighthearted rom/com I strongly recommend watching this, in fact, if you haven't seen it already stop reading and go watch it, like right now...\r\nStory 9/10: The main story line behind this anime is good but it's a harem rom-com and there's only so much you can expectat the same time . While there are plenty of surprises it's not going to throw you through a loop anytime soon; however, the unique ideas and their presentation throughout the story wont leave you feeling like you just waited an episode to watch what you already knew was going to happen. Part of the reason I scored story so high was also because of the dialogue/situations which are so memorable and entertaining, in addition to very well done. To sum it up it's an interesting and funny story that sticks to being light-hearted in nature while throwing in just the right amount of drama to pull you in and keep you invested/wanting to know will happen next. Also, on a side note, while there is a harem tag for this anime the story goes very easy on this point and doesn't let it interfere with the story so don't be put off by it.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: The art was well done both with the character designs and background and the animation was fluid. While there is nothing lacking on this front it's not amazing; however, it fits the mood of the anime to a point. While it may not be as detailed or crisp as some other anime I believe anything different would have only hurt the overall feeling this anime gives to its viewers.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: Shout-out to the absolutely amazing voice-actors/actresses in this anime they did a superb job. Due to the nature of the story the voices of the characters often have to represent the personalities of others and the talent and skill that went into portraying and nailing this perfectly didn't entirely hit me until later. The OP was amazing, I listened to it every episode (which is kind of rare, normally I skip them) The ED was good and it felt like it summed up the feelings of the anime, but I can't summon the same enthusiasm for it as I did the OP. As for the OST, I didn't really notice it... which is a good thing :D It wasn't spectacular but it fit the anime well enough that it was able to enhance/match the mood without distracting you from what was going on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10: I can't really decide if this was lacking or not so I'll have to settle for the fact that character development seemed a bit rushed. Aside from the MC, and in some ways the club members, the other notable characters don't get too much time, especially the other witches, while they do have enough back-story and depth to give you a feel for or understand them I kind of felt like if I'd blinked at the wrong time I would have missed something important. All the same though they were at least able to be developed to an extent, allowing distinct personalities/emotions to come through with a basis for where they came from.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: The worst part about light-hearted rom-coms and especially harems is that they tend to use cliche scenarios without any care for uniqueness, It's like the directors expect you to have the same reaction to a situation every time you see it, and its because of this that I enjoyed this anime so much. The dialogue/scenarios are what set this apart from the midden heap that is slowly becoming the harem and/or rom-com genre. This anime will make you laugh, but most importantly it will leave you feeling complete, like I said in the beginning anything more would just detract from this anime. The story starts with a bang, sweeping you off your feet, and when it comes to a conclusion it sets you down so softly at the finish line all you can do is look back and smile.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: Worth every second and I hope the rest of you enjoyed it as much as I did, and if you haven't seen it yet I hope my review might make you consider watching it, Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "All my reviews are spoiler free aimed towards people who haven't seen the show.\r\nYamada-kun and the Seven Witches. \r\nThe best recipe for the most delicious cake, all you gotta do is give the time it needs to bake, but noooo, gotta have it now, turning up the heat doesn't make it bake faster, IT JUST BURNS!!!.... \r\nStory: Ryuu Yamada is known as a delinquent in his high school. One day, he accidentally falls from a flight of stairs onto Urara Shiraishi, the ace student of the school. Yamada wakes up to find that he has swapped bodies with her! The two try to reverse thechange and discover that kissing triggers the body swap. Yamada takes advantage of this asking Shiraishi to take tests for him and discovers while in her body that she gets picked on for being such a model student. Yamada and his delinquent ways put a stop to the girls picking on her. Student council vice-president Toranosuke Miyamura, discovers this little event and recruits the two to revive the Super Natural Studies Club. Yamada and Shiraishi continue to use this exchange until an unexpected encounter with a certain girl reveals a another usual power activated by a kiss, in fact there may even be a few more....... thus the Super Natural Studies Club declare to discover the secrets of the Suzaku High School \"witches\". Although this task doesn't come with easy, nor does the situation turn out to be as simplistic as they thought.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters all fall under hard personality tropes. No surprise there really, they are well written though. The cast is considerably large, all have some interesting backstory as well. Unfortunately because of time restraint, you only get a glimpse of these characters potential depth and with a flip of the dime, that's their character development. The best part of the show is the quality voice acting. The cast is great and their performances, especially Saori Hayami as Shiraishi and Ryota Osaka as Yamada are absolutely brilliant! Yamada is always late for school, naps in class and gets abysmal grades. His life is a dead bore. Even though he's a delinquent,  he's kinda a nice guy... for the most part. Urara Shiraishi is an exceptionally brilliant student known to be cold and asocial, due to her being ostracized by the students of Suzaku High. Miaymura is charismatic, be able to easily charm most people around him thanks to his look and being friendly in general. Despite this, he doesn't really have any friends. Miyabi is a considerably attractive and cheerful girl, due to her strange interest in the super natural, she is considered among her peers to be a fraud and a liar.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: It's pretty solid. The colors are nice and they move quite well. All the witches have a very distinct and interesting design. Some of their glamor drawings are absolutely beautiful. The OP was amazingly done. As was some of the faded frames during flashbacks and things of that nature. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The music was pretty decent. Love \"Kuchizuke Diamond\" by WEAVER. Actually started listen to more of their songs. Choice of BGM was fun when it needed to be and dramatic when it should. It did it's job.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is where I'm torn. I thought is was really funny, I also thought it was very clever concept. I love the chemistry shown between our MC and lead witch. I also like all the characters and the story behind their personality and actions. But it wasn't nearly fleshed out enough to make the connection between Yamada and the witches, it was all really forced. And then the story was also incredibly rushed. The scenes were good but lacked any impact when they were so abruptly introduced and resolved. Near the end it almost became confusing, and not in a in-depth convoluted sense, but more like, \"well we're running out of time, so we'll skip the why and just go with the how\". \\n\\n\r\nSo much was cut out, not just comedy but little bits of development that would make character relationships feel like they had a connection. And the quick pace eliminated any type of suspense or mystery to the development of the story. All of this could have been avoided with another 12 episodes and following the source material. This could have been an incredible show. As it is, it's merely fun. Definitely worth  watching.  7/10.",

            "content": "SPOILER FREE REVIEW\r\nYou fap to Yuri shamelessly? You have diabetes because you overdose on Vanilla? You secretly worship Yaoi? You openly admit that you love all three? This anime basically is one-size-fits-all for everyone of all sexual orientations and preferences.\r\nYamada-kun and the Seven Bitches (you read that right), or Y7 for short, is a surprisingly good anime with an actual, plot-line, legit romance and some interesting characters. The premise isn\u2019t unique, ground-breaking or interesting at first glance, but it\u2019s all in the execution. Yep people, shits actually get done in here, shits that are relevant to the story. It\u2019s a rom-com with an actual plotand story progression, what else could one wish for? Another thing I liked is that the anime stays true to its light-hearted theme and doesn\u2019t try to creep into the realm of philosophy. Because it makes no sense for high school idiots to keep spewing out Aristotle crap about life and the universe unless they were tripping balls.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not too sure about the Harem tag being there, I mean a dude going around kissing and getting intimate with a bunch of Bitches isn\u2019t Harem at all. Jokes aside, there aren\u2019t any discernible Harem elements, at most a triangle but it resolved itself anyway. \\n\\n\r\nPlot 8/10\\n\r\nThe plot is essentially about our male lead going around kissing random Bitches and Hoes and Dudes to solve his life problems. One ticket to Y7-land please. The overarching plot isn't revealed half-way into the anime but it\u2019s focused, doesn\u2019t deviate to some stupid, pointless fillers. It gets somewhat darker towards the end as opposed to the usually light and comedic theme, but it has a good transition. The pacing is somewhat rushed but still slow enough for me to comprehend wtf is going on. In general, the execution of the plot was outstanding, you will be gripped till the very end. 11/10 would kiss again - IGN\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy aspect is simply fucking hilarious. I had many good laughs from this series, and even as much as rewatching certain scenes. The immaturity, dirty-ness and fan service is integral to the comedy and they were done to a reasonable extent, appropriate according to the situations, not overblown and redundant to the point of borderlining ecchi (looking at you, monogatari series). Let\u2019s be honest that the first thing you\u2019d do after switching body with someone of the opposite sex is touching yourself incessantly.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance slowly and naturally develops as the story progresses and it actually makes sense, wasn\u2019t too abrupt, full of retarded melodrama, crying or misunderstandings. In the end I genuinely wanted our main couple to be together. NOW KISS.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7.5/10\\n\r\nEye-pleasingly bright and vivid (seriously, their eyes glow brighter than my future). Character art is relatively unique and appealing that I can distinguish one character from another with ease. The quality stays consistent throughout and doesn\u2019t deteriorate like many other series at certain scenes. Overall the art and animation is excellent and worthy of praise.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP animation killed some of the anticipation by giving away the identity of the Seven Bitches and the main couple pairing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10\\n\r\nThe OP is fairly upbeat and catchy, I find myself listening to it occasionally but not the ED. There isn\u2019t a wide range of OSTs, they're repeated but really add to the enthusiastic mood and are quite entertaining to hear.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial commendation goes to the voice actors as they\u2019ve done a terrific job of voicing the characters especially when they switch bodies. The exceptional voice acting is a major source of comedy and enjoyability of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10 \\n\r\nThe cast is quite large for a 12-episode anime to handle, as such the characters\u2019 background stories are barely explored, just enough to explain their motives and personalities. In the end, a lot of them didn\u2019t receive development and was left out as it all boils down to our main couple, Yamada and Shiraishi.\\n\\n\r\n- Yamada: Introduced as an aggressive delinquent and is actually an aggressive delinquent, not suddenly turned into some generic nice, caring main lead over time. He\u2019s a meanie that I can relate to, I mean he\u2019s tired of school n shit, so true for me right now. On another note, he\u2019s fucking hilarious.\\n\r\n- SHIRAISHI BEST BITCH. Kuudere is the best dere and on top of that, she\u2019s a busty, nice and caring blonde, who wouldn\u2019t want a piece of that? She received the most development and obviously I was drawn into her. Speculatively she has a dark side as evident in her malicious glare on the stairs during ep 1 and the pics her picture book. This makes her somewhat more interesting, too bad it was never elaborated upon. Her apathy to things going on around her is fucking hilarious. Also, her gentle smile at the end of the OP animation totally got me.\\n\r\n- ODAGIRI SECOND BEST BITCH because she received considerable development and has more depth than the other Bitches. If there\u2019s a best there\u2019s gotta be a second best and no one else is more deserving of this than her I guess. They see her triangle-in' they hatin'.\\n\\n\r\nOther Bitches and Hoes include:\\n\r\n- Bitch who talks so much without even talking, why are women so noisy?\\n\r\n- Bitch who can see your miserable future\\n\r\n- Bitch who can see your fetishes because she can touch your heart (lol wut)\\n\r\n- Bitch who can turn invisible because fuck you and your peeping\\n\r\n- Bitch that I don't remember for some reason\\n\r\nThey don't stand out much from one another due to the lack of screentime because they were in the kitchen. They look gorgeous but sadly they have nothing else to offer but their voluptuous, inviting bodies. Heck there's even a Commando Bitch.\\n\\n\r\nApparently there are more dudes and Hoes, they were even of some importance but for sure I forgot about them as quickly as I forgot about high school notes after graduation. I can understand Miyamura being in the OP animation but that green-haired-dude-who-doesn\u2019t-swing-that-way-but I-forgot-his-name guy? Wtf was he doing there?\\n\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 8/10\\n\r\nY7 was so much better in many aspects than what I expected it to be, sadly it\u2019s a little bit underrated among the anime community.\\n\\n\r\nOur couple didn\u2019t kiss for real at the end do you know how much that destroyed my heart? What the fuck that\u2019s dumb as hell, writers stop being incompetent. Whoever made it that way must\u2019ve been a bunch of feminists opposing kissing because it\u2019s oppression against women.\\n\\n\r\nTL/DR\\n\r\n+ Shiraishi\\n\r\n+ Everything is fucking hilarious\\n\r\n+ Plot and theme stay consistent throughout\\n\r\n+ Excellent animation, voice acting\\n\r\n+ Interesting cast of characters, good interactions\\n\r\n+ Shiraishi\\n\\n\r\n- Sporadic character focus. Little to no background and development\\n\r\n- Little revealed about the school and how the Bitches came to be.\\n\r\n- No s2 yet. I mean this is a good story, there\u2019s gotta be s2 right? Right? RIGHT? RIIIIIGHT? *drowns in delusion*\\n\r\n- Shiraishi isn\u2019t real, just like your social life and good grades\\n\r\n- The amount of misogyny in this review\\n\\n\r\nBy all means, watch this anime if you want to relieve stress from your pitifully abysmal amount of high school work (compared to my college work), arouse your weird fetishes, waifu (husbando) fishing or simply kill time because you aren't in college.",

            "content": "My original review: http://pokemaster12.blogspot.com/2015/07/yamada-kun-and-seven-witches_25.html\r\nYamada-kun and the Seven Witches is probably one of my favorite anime of the previous season. Why? Well, it could be the fanservice. The fanservice they had was actually not as intrusive nor as obnoxious as some of the other anime to have come out recently. They had just enough that it was funny and flowed well with the story, but not enough that it destroyed the story itself. But then again, maybe it was the story that got me to love this anime.\r\nRyuu Yamada is a punk. He shows up at school late, sleeps in class, and doesn't do his homework.He finds his opposite in Urara Shiraishi, a beautiful girl whose the top student in school and always seen studying. One day when they're both walking up a flight of stairs, Yamada trips and they fall down. When he wakes up, Yamada discovers that he and Shiraishi have switched bodies. I find this basic premise to be incredibly interesting. It's hard to find original themes and ideas in the entertainment industry. However, while I'm sure this idea has been done before, I'll confess that it is the first time I've ever seen a story where a guy and girl swap bodies - and it's definitely the first time I've heard of two people swapping bodies from a kiss.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAside form having an intriguing premise, I absolutely love the characters in this story. Each of them feel like fully-fleshed out people, the kind you'd see walking down the street. They seem to have their own story to tell, and unlike most anime of this genre, they're not just caricatures of specific archetypes. Ryuu Yamada is a perfect example of this. He looks and acts like a punk, but as the story progresses, you see that he's actually a compassionate and caring person. He always puts others before himself, and does his best to help people even at great personal risk. He also makes a surprisingly good tsukkomi. Of course, my favorite character in all this would definitely have to be Urara Shiraishi. Aside from being downright gorgeously designed, I really enjoy her character. At first glance, she appears to be a kuudere type of girl; quiet, unobtrusive and studious. As the anime progresses you begin to learn more about her, and Shiraishi begins to change. While her original of being quiet remains mostly intact, her development as a person is more than obvious and truly a joy to watch happen.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLike all anime of the harem/romance/comedy variety, this one has its fanservice. Unlike most anime to have come out in recent years, however, the fanservice in Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches doesn't make me cringe. It's very light, giving you enough to laugh at and enjoy, but not so much that you feel like you're watching a hentai. It's funny and flows well with the story, but isn't overbearing. In other words, they have just the right amount of fanservice. A part of me wonders if the reason for this is because the writer/illustrator of the manga is actually a woman.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll this being said, if I had to name one reason why I like this anime over others, it would be the kissing. I feel like this anime is trying to make up for the lack of kisses in every other romance anime out there. I've watched a lot of anime with romance and only a few seem to actually have kissing in them. I don't know why this is, but Yamada-kun makes up for it by having several kisses pretty much every episode. I'll admit, the inner romantic in me squealed every time I saw Yamada and Shiraishi kiss. What's more, the ending left me completely fulfilled. This was one of the few romcom anime where I actually watched it all the way through to the end and felt utterly satisfied.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI think it is safe to say that everyone has a wish they want fulfilled. Money, power, and fame are the common ones, as they seem to be the most wanted. But money, power, and fame are not everything. More often than not, what we need most is not a shiny new car or rabid fans but instead something a bit more universal. A shoulder to lean on, a friend to hang out with, or a partner to hug; one of the greatest aspects in life are the relationships we share with the people around us.For it is these very relationships that do what those previous three wishes cannot: make us happy for a lifetime. Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches is all about relationships, wishes, and of course witches, that provides an average outing overall.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe Seven Witches (as it will be named from here on out) stars Yamada-kun, a delinquent whose behavior makes him very difficult to associate with. One day, when walking up some steps, he falls, crashing into the top student of the school, Urara Shiraishi, which magically causes their bodies to switch. From there, the quest to find the other six witches begins.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the anime\u2019s greatest strength comes in the form of the theme it tackles: the importance of relationships. Whether it is with friends, family, or anyone in-between, people are always looking to form a connection with those around them. This is the main point of the show, with the witch powers revolving around such a concept. For instance, Shiraishi is able to switch bodies because she always wanted to experience a different lifestyle, Nene is able to coerce others because she was looking to gain increased support, Maria can see the future in order to have others avoid terrible fates, etc. As the anime depicts, the girls have these abilities and use them on their fellow classmates not because they can but because they wanted to have everlasting relationships that they could not obtain otherwise. Scenarios like Noa dealing with some teenagers\u2019 hardships and Meiko working with students to perform better on their tests showcase the differing ways in which relationships are formed and comfort is found in others.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best and simplest examples of the show\u2019s emphasis on relationships that the anime employs is the kissing that is needed to use these witch powers. Kissing, be it on the hand, the cheek, or the lips, is a sign of affection towards another, and a known symbol of love between two people. Throughout the entirety of the anime, kissing is shared mostly between Yamada-kun and Shiraishi, but also between many more with gender being a second thought. Nobody thinks of it as anything more than a necessity until the end where Shiraishi clumsily goes through the act. She understands that now, after losing her power, the kiss\u2019s true meaning is all that is left.\\n\\n\r\nBut it took a lot to get to that moment; the girls, despite being granted amazing gifts, do not find immediate solace. In fact, while their status gave them interesting abilities, at the same time their powers actually prevented them from maintaining the relationships they so desperately wanted. Certain situations, such as Saionji\u2019s ability causing everyone to forget about her and Maria being unable to have a boyfriend, made it impossible to create such relationships. Worst still, those around them were affected, too; Yamada and Leona experience this firsthand through the loss they undergo. In this way, the conclusion of the anime \u2013 where the characters discover that it was not their powers that allowed them to all become such good friends but the experiences themselves \u2013 is a simple message that finishes the narrative nicely.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is one glaring issue that The Seven Witches has, known as \u201cfiring and forgetting.\u201d The anime follows usually the same sequence of events: learn of new witch, help this witch, and move on from said witch. There are minor discrepancies to this formula in the beginning (where the main group is being put together) and during one event in the middle (still dealing with forming the main group) but the show generally has the tendency to forego its most important aspect, namely the witches. Despite them all having interesting abilities, the anime refuses to use the girls in conjunction with one another or even after they have been discovered. This is strange because of the theme on relationships; one would think that, given the focus on it, such newfound relationships would play a more pivotal role in the scenarios encountered. Again, the non-witches are affected by this tactic as well because, after a certain point, cast members such as Miyamura and Miyabi are pushed to the side to make way for the anime\u2019s next set of occurrences.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOne of The Seven Witches weakest areas is the art it utilizes. In short, it is boring; besides the characters themselves not visiting too many locations outside of their clubroom or other parts of the school, there is little in the way of detail. At the minimum, the show does use some pretty hysterical reaction faces \u2013 usually performed by Yamada-kun \u2013 that have the eyes bug out as giant, white spheres that have lost their pupils. It sounds scary but it works to make Yamada-kun seem even more incredulous.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are very nice, especially for the female characters. While they tend to follow typical tropes for the medium \u2013 an uncommon hair and color combination \u2013 it fits with the uniqueness the girls have due to them being witches. Shiraishi\u2019s long blonde hair and jewel-like eyes, Nene\u2019s short purple hair, and Maria\u2019s earrings with pink hair and ponytail, with each wearing their school\u2019s uniform, is quite attractive. Yamada-kun\u2019s spiky blue hair and unkempt attire also coincides with his overall demeanor.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation is somewhere around average. There isn\u2019t a whole lot of action within the anime itself and therefore little movement. Lots of dialogue and sitting around is had instead, with the characters really only being animated when going through those all-important kisses.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nDue to the \u201cfiring and forgetting\u201d method used on the characters, many of the witches only have minor background details given about them. There is very little in the way of development because the show just does not give them any time whatsoever. This is evident in characters like Meiko and Noa who, after their specific episode, have nothing else about them provided. Other characters, like Miyabi and Ushio, undergo the same treatment of initial divulgence on their persons followed by a stagnation of their character. Nene at least garners a bit more attention in the form of (ironic) unrequited love, but it is nothing worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nTwo arguments arise as to why nearly the whole cast is little more than their personality traits: the comedic nature of the anime and the size of the cast. Since the show is more about inducing laughter than enacting drama, it becomes understandable that the characters are not entirely complex. Instead, by being only known for their individual shticks, the comedy is easier to handle and therefore present. As for the large cast size, the bigger it is, the more resources have to be spread evenly between everyone, devaluing each of the characters to a certain extent. That is, it becomes unrealistic to expect every cast member to be entirely fleshed out. This type of logic can be seen in most comedies involving a sizeable amount of characters, meaning them not being the most compelling of people is not too much of a negative.\\n\\n\r\nThe Seven Witches does put higher emphasis on two characters: Shiraishi and Yamada-kun. Shiraishi, as has been briefly described earlier, is the model student of the school. She is beautiful, gets great grades, and is respectful to those around her. Yet she has extreme difficulty connecting with others because many people are jealous of what she has, and for those that are not they cannot seem to understand the girl who hides behind her books. It is not until Yamada-kun shows up that she begins to open up. What is interesting is how the phrase \u201copposites attract\u201d both does and does not apply. She is like Yamada-kun because they both find themselves unable to connect with people and she is unlike Yamada-kun because of her passiveness compared to his active behavior. That last fact is a constant factor, with her mostly tagging along for the whole season. To that end, at times she feels nonexistent which in turn stagnates her character, but at the minimum she opens up more so than she ever did before.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Yamada-kun, he is arguably the strongest character the anime has to offer. Upon entering high school, he wanted to leave behind his old self in favor of a new one, but found that he once more could not find a place to call his own. It is at this point that Yamada-kun stumbles upon and on Shiraishi, with the rest of the season following. The further along it goes, the more situations he finds himself in and subsequently the more relationships he establishes with the people around him. He almost loses them forever, but his newfound determination fostered throughout the series pulls through, with him saving Shiraishi and the other witches with a wish that makes perfect sense; Yamada-kun already has everything he could ever wish for, so him unburdening the girls now and in the future to form their own relationships brings everyone the greatest amount of happiness. At this point, the reason for him having such a power to start with becomes clear: not only did he need friends and relationships the most out of anyone in the school but it was what he wanted more than anything all along. Meaning, he was granted all of the witch powers \u2013 which were designed to create these connections \u2013 to eventually achieve his wish, and achieve his true wish he did.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme starts and ends nicely, but the middle is rather repetitive. Listening to the piece more closely, the vocalist does nearly all of the work, while the instruments are composed in such a way as to bring about a mysterious yet hopeful vibe befitting the anime well enough. The ending theme mirrors its opening counterpart in that the singer does the heavy lifting; she has wonderful range and really carries the piece despite the boring beat.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the soundtrack is nothing too notable. There are tracks that follow the feeling of magic through their strange-sounding instruments, hard-guitar riffs for Yamada-kun\u2019s more rough-and-tumble encounters, piano melodies for the happy and sad times, and other tunes that find their place among the mystery that permeates many of the events. It is an OST that is not worth listening to outside of the anime itself, being little more than background noise.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for the anime is somewhere slightly above average. Special shout-outs are deserved for Ryota Osaka as Yamada-kun for his accent and reactionary way of speaking and Saori Hayami as Shiraishi for her \u201cmanlier\u201d way of speaking when Yamada-kun took over her body.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nLooking back through the anime, I found the first half or so pretty funny. Shiraishi was very cute, her interactions with Yamada-kun were always adorable, Miyabi and Miyamura were fun with their teasing, the body-switching created hilarious scenarios, and Nene\u2019s embarrassment despite her confidence made for quite the happy times.\\n\\n\r\nBut when the show moved away from its comedic roots and into the more dramatic elements later on, it started to fall apart. Due to the progression of the story, there were fewer cute moments between the main couple, the side characters were pushed to the sidelines, the powers were used less and less, and due to the shift in tone the anime was not looking to make Nene blush but instead have her cry. To put it differently, when the anime was trying to be funny, it was, and when it was not, it really should have been.\\n\\n\r\nThe point about not utilizing the witch powers to their full extent, talked about here and in other areas, was also sad to see. When the anime places so much importance on the witches that it includes them in the title itself, and then proceeds to not do anything with them, it doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense. It is even worse when the witches and their personalities added some spice to the mix. Noa\u2019s clinginess, Maria\u2019s assertiveness, and Meiko\u2019s dual personality were all quirks that the anime could have leveraged but failed to do so.\\n\\n\r\nYamada-kun and the Seven Witches has an interesting premise that ultimately does not go anywhere. Its themes are personable and some of its characters are interesting, but the misuse of its cast, the lackluster art, and the lame soundtrack bring the whole package down. While Yamada-kun and Shiraishi live happily ever after, this one still needs a wish of its own.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, theme on relationships is executed nicely but \u201cfiring and forgetting\u201d is rampant\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, boring art style, fitting reaction faces, nice character designs, about average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Nene and the side characters are passable, Shiraishi is okay, with Yamada-kun undoubtedly being a strong character\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, boring soundtrack, slightly above average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, Shiraishi is adorable, with the show being hilarious earlier rather than later\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "Yamada and the seven witches is about a delinquent called Yamada but one day he's world change when fell down the stairs with smartest person in the school Shiraishi and next thing you know they switched bodies.\r\nFor starters I read the manga, Yamada and the seven witches they tried to stuff  a story that is worthy 24 episode or more into 12 episodes. \r\nStory\r\nThe story has a great concept where a guy has to find the seven witches and in order to do that he has to kiss them. The story pacing felt rush to me they have a different arc each episode buttell the most important part from the manga. And the ending was very satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\r\nLiden Film did a great job with the art, the art style was very vivid with the colors with the color of the eyes and color of the hair. I loved the aura when they try to do a romantic mood with the lighting and the close up to there face and Yamada angry expression with the big vein in his forehead with dark black lines.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe voice acting for Yamada and Shiraishi is on point. They match how they are portrayed with Shiraishi shy low voice and Yamada loud voice. The background music enhances the mood that the story is trying to set. I love love the opening it is one of the most catchy song where you can skip the opening and won't forget but the ending is your typical pop girl ending song that you won't remember.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nYamada and the seven witches have variety of characters but have your typical smart girl, dumb person, but there personality is different for what they are for example typical smart girl would be protective but she is a chill character where she doesn't mind kissing and just move on. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nMy enjoyment watching it was great and always looking forward every sunday watching this show. I think people who never read the manga and people who read it would love the show and love to rewatch this series in the future\\n",

            "content": "Powers are something that a lot of people wish to have in their lives.  The ability to do all sorts of neat tricks beyond the capabilities of humans like fly, read minds, and fire laser beams from your eyes are something that everyone thinks of having at least once in their lives.  But if you really got them, have you ever thought about the kind of impact they could have on your life?  Here, a review of Yamada-kun and the seven witches, a show that features seven individuals with a similar predicament.  \r\nStory (7.00/10): The story of Yamada-kun (that's the shorthandedway I'll be calling this series) follows the life of a delinquent individual by the name of Yamada Ryuu.  Feeling a little bit frustrated with boring life at school, he has a chance meeting with one of the school's top students, Shirashi Urara, on a flight of stairs, where he accidentally trips and knocks them both to the base of the steps.  It is discovered a little later on that the two characters have now switched bodies all of a sudden through the method of a kiss (you can probably guess what Yamada did now that he was in a girl's body.), sending the two on a journey where they find the seven witches, six other individuals who have the same kind of mystical power.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Yamada-kun for the most part bases itself around a witch of the week style of storytelling, where every episode/few episodes are centered around one particular witch, then move onto the next one, until the series's ends.  Within each of these stories, Yamada is faced with a different problem, a situation that each witch needs to have resolved before they are able to live happily on account of their powers acting both as a blessing and a curse.  With this, the show provides character development for our main protagonist in particular, as he slowly begins to think otherwise of his \"boring school life\" and begins to appreciate and enjoy what he has built up, thinking about others rather than himself.  (It's a nice progression.)  \\n\\n\r\nAlso, because this series revolves around the idea of witch powers that are used/exchanged through the art of kissing people, no matter what kind of fan you are, whether it's yaoi, yuri, or vanilla, you'll be finding something you'll like.  (Service for everyone!!!)\\n\\n\r\nBut here's the biggest issue I have with this series.  This anime features the story of the \"first witches arc\" in the manga, the first major arc of the series that takes up about 90 or so chapters to fill up, 90 very detailed and well written chapters.  As such, the anime takes a couple liberties to try and finish this arc within the small 12 episode timeframe.  This for me is a major flaw.  The reason for this is mostly to blame on the pacing, and how rushed this show is.  Because of its small timeframe, the show gets rid of quite a lot of important details to the storytelling, leaving the show to really just be the bare backbone of the original Yamada-kun story.  The events of the show are shown very quickly, before going into an awkward timeskip in order to go to move the story along.  As a result of this, the characters' actions don't really have a greatly significant effect as they could've, and some points in general are just thrown out the window.  \\n\\n\r\nBut in the end, Yamada-kun is a story that was in the end still enjoyable to watch.  While it missed a lot of important details within its storytelling, you'll still get a general gist of what is going on even without those little bits of information.  They'll be several cohesion problems as to why this specific action works to the characters' advantage, or why this character suddenly has a change of heart, but if you don't let the nitty gritty parts bother you that much, then all will be good.  Sadly though, this is still a case of \"the manga is better than the anime\" so keep that in mind if you prefer to watch it rather than read.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good story idea \\n\r\n+ Character development\\n\r\n+ Literally EVERYONE kisses each other (That to me is hilarious)\\n\r\n-  Rushed pacing\\n\r\n-  A horrendous amount of missing plot details\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.44/10): Similarly, the characters in Yamada-kun have a problem identical to the problem that the story had.  The characters are great, but at the same time, a lot of them just don't have the same kind of impact.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Yamada-kun himself, the protagonist of this fine little story.  As a \"delinquent\" style character, Yamada is a very brash and loudmouthed character, always speaking in an angry sounding tone and frustrated by when things don't go the way he feels they should.  While hard looking on the outside, Yamada's actually a bit softie, going out of his way to help the witches with their problems using his own power in the process.  His development for the most part comes from him helping each witch in the series one by one, as he throws himself in the line of fire to help protect and help these girls that are dealing with their own personal issues.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then, we have Shirashi Urara, the main female protagonist of the series.  Shirashi is a very calm girl, someone who is very willing to do what is needed in order to help the situation and is never panicked whenever she is face with a problem.  As such, she serves as an aid to help with whatever problem that Yamada is trying to resolve and helps the series' progression overall.  As a witch herself, she has a problem similar to the other six in the series, which, with the help of Yamada gets resolved and in the end, helps better her life.  \\n\\n\r\nThe side cast for Yamada is split off into two categories, the witches themselves, and the \"witch hunters\" as I call them, aka all the other characters in the series.  As for the witches, these characters are the centralized part of the story, utilizing most of the runtime in order to tell their problem, and have Yamada attempt to resolve it for them.  What I like about these girls is the fact that all of them have a look of progression with them, meaning that from the start of their story to the end, there is a significant change in most of them (since Asuka's a bitch...) and as a result, they all gain development and change towards their character.  As for the witch hunters, they vary in terms of importance.  Because it follows the story of the original manga, several rather important characters show up a lot later in the series on account of arc importance.  The issue with this is the fact that because they are delivered to us so late, they don't really get much importance or screentime as much as they should.  As a result a couple of them lack a proper character and the rushed feeling of the series is prominent with them.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good main cast\\n\r\n+ Central characters get character development\\n\r\n-  Most of the side cast are lackluster in terms of importance and/or development\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.00/10 and 8.10/10): The art for Yamada-kun was strictly made by LIDENFILMS.  The art for the series is a very light style, with the color palette of the series going towards a very white/light part of the spectrum.  As a result, the series is very whimsical looking and very bright.  The art for the series is what I would consider to be slightly above standard fare, as the quality for the series never seems to dip, and the overall look of the show is always very good looking with no glaring oddities and problems that I see.  Of course, it's not overly extraordinary, as they don't consistently have examples of outstanding animation, but it is still a very good look for the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the art for the series has a bit of a comedic feel to it, with the series using exaggerated facial expressions for the characters, which brings a bit more life into the series and a nice bit of comedy that I personally feel fits with the show.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, the OP for this series is one I personally find to be both fantastic, and very memorable.  It has a very original sound to it with its very flourishing sounds and bright tone which I personally find to be both enjoyable and something that I would want to listen to over and over again.  As for the ED, I personally don't find it to really be anything of any consideration.  It's nice, but it's a bit too generic for my taste, and it just doesn't seem to be all that memorable.  The rest of the soundtrack also falls into this category.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I have to give credit to the seiyuus for giving a great performance, since this series is one that requires one to play several roles on account of the characters in the series body switching and having to talk in more ways than one.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good quality art\\n\r\n+ Great sounding OP\\n\r\n-  Rest of the soundtrack is a bit lackluster\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (7.48/10): While Yamada-kun is a series I feel is a great and well written, this anime adaptation simply just didn't pull off the best execution that I had originally expected.  While we did get a good start to the series with its first three episodes, the rest just felt a bit disappointing as it started to rush towards the finish.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nContrary to what I have been saying, Yamada-kun is indeed a series that I still did enjoy.  It was nice to see the series in animated form and I was pleased to see not only the characters, but the scenes that I enjoyed reading.  I thought the seiyuus did a wonderful job in their voice acting on account of having to basically play multiple parts, and I really liked the aesthetics and the opening.  (This opening is probably one of the better ones this season.)\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nIt was rushed, plain and simple.  Because the show wanted to finish a huge story arc in the span of 12 episodes, the enjoyment factor dipped significantly.  While yes, I have read the Yamada-kun manga, I was wondering for the majority of the time as to how the characters in the series came up with a conclusion or how they were able to do this.  I knew how, but seeing from the perspective of someone new to the series, I just didn't see how it would really make sense to come to this conclusion the characters needing to do something in order to come to this resolution.  There were important details, entire mini story arcs in fact, that were missing from this adaptation, and I really wasn't happy with how the show took far too many liberties in order to finish where they wanted it to be.  Kind of wish there was more runtime so that things could be fleshed out a little bit more.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I would still say that Yamada-kun is still a decent adaptation.  While it did miss a lot of things that I would say are essential to the story's explanation, the overall adaptation is still the bare backbone of the Yamada-kun story and as such, is still relatively good in the fact that you still get the general idea of the story and should have a rather enjoyable time watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.50/10",

            "content": "Yamada-kun to 7-nin no majo aka Yamada and the 7 witches. i originally did not even notice this anime and wasn't gonna watch it i thought it was gonna be just meh and boy did i judge a book by its cover it was so under the radar for me that i consider it underrated also the best anime of the season in my personal opinion. If i had one major issue it would be the pacing it was a little fast.\r\nStory- I would have liked the anime to be longer but it definitely got to everything it needed in terms of the 7 witchesstory.The setting is within the school premises for the most part and the story consists of a guy who is a delinquent who ends up accidentally trips from a flight of stairs on to a girl who is the best student in the school they end up kissing during the fall and then they body swap during the exchange and later on realize that the kiss triggered the body switch so fast forward they revive an old club and the club that is for finding the 7 witches and the wacky funny dramatic journey begins.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance it may not seem very exciting and enticing but its interesting and as you get into the story you realize the burdens the witches face because of the powers they possess and you also get just so much weird wacky moments overall the story really stood out compared to everything i have watched this anime season.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Colorful real shiny overall its just something really good that honestly it sticks out the drawings may not be wow but mixed with everything the vibrancy if the colors the rainy scenes it was just really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound- not much to say everything fits within the anime it has an awesome opening and intro one of the best in the season imo and also has a decent ending. Character voices match the characters and the ost is fitting to say the most good overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- In terms of characters you get the 7 witches of course the 2 witch ******* and the student council along with some other characters you get an decent amount of characters that actually contribute to the story and you also get a crap load of character development within the 7 witches for their specific episodes once they are found and also get alot of development through the leading male character the witches powers creates for some funny moments and dramatic moments and pasts that  you might relate to irl or just sympathize with. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10 like i said my personal favorite and best anime ive seen this season in terms of everything including other seasons of anime from b4.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10 was it perfect? no but it was really good. Was it satisfying? Yes it was but i would have liked to seen more but the ending was a perfect fit to end the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe adaptation from the manga (never read will start reading) to the anime form wasn't good because based on opinions from the manga readers it is completely different but one thing ive noticed amongst the manga readers are that the anime even though it doesn't follow the manga it is still great on its own. My anime of the season is Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo (TV).",

            "content": "Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches was definitely one of the better anime of the Spring season. While the concept of supernatural elements in a school setting and body switching isn't exactly new, this series was able to pull them off in an entertaining and interesting way nonetheless.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story revolves around the seemingly mean-spirited delinquent, Ryuu Yamada, and his complete polar opposite, Urara Shiraishi. The two students take an unexpected tumble down their school's stairs and end up kissing by accident, which causes them to magically switch bodies. When they discover that kissing is what triggers the strange phenomenon, another student discovers their little secretand convinces them to help him revive the Supernatural Studies Club in order to find other girls with strange powers. While the plot itself isn't the best or original, it was still fairly interesting. The pacing was overall okay, and it never felt too slow or dragged out. The ending wrapped up problems satisfyingly enough even though it was predictable. Overall, I have no major complaints with the story even if it had some minor flaws.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art and backgrounds are colorful, vibrant, and overall well-drawn. It was nice and seemed to have a sense of effort put in. I thought the character designs were appealing and charming enough. The animation was decent, and it got the job done without any major flaws or hiccups. I never noticed a dip in quality and it stayed consistent all throughout. As a newer anime, the art and animation was definitely well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music was pretty good. I definitely enjoyed listening to the super catchy and upbeat opening every week. The ending wasn't that bad either. The background music was pretty standard and not particularly noteworthy, but it did fit the tone of most of the scenes well enough. All the Japanese voice actors were great. I especially liked how they changed their voices whenever a certain character swapped into someone else's body.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThere are a slew of characters and the majority of them were likeable, interesting, and their backstories fleshed out okay enough to actually care about them. Most of the focus is on Yamada and how he helps each witch from whatever complication they are facing and their eventual involvement with the group. I thought the romantic relationship between Yamada and Shiraishi was executed fairly well. It didn't feel forced or anything. Unfortunately, one lacking aspect I did notice was that most of the side characters aren't fully developed due to the large cast size and time restraints. I felt we only got to see a part of it as it doesn't go as in depth with them. That said, each character had a purpose that helped push the plot along, so no character felt useless. It was also really enjoyable to see the characters in the many comedic situations due to all the body swapping and other supernatural abilities of the witches. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI quite enjoyed watching Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches. It was a funny, interesting, and fun watch. The series was mostly a lighthearted comedy, but it did sometimes get a little bit more serious when it came to the more dramatic parts revolving around the character conflicts. That helped keep things interesting. If you go in and watch the series for what it is, you most likely won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nYamada-kun exceeded my expectations and it was one of the more interesting series of the season. The comedy was on point, the romance was believable, the characters were solid, and the story played out satsfyingly enough. It wasn't perfect, but it nonetheless has more than enough merits and positive aspects that makes it a decent watch. If you're looking for a supernatural rom-com, then I recommend giving this series a try.",

Or so he thought..\r\nHe later discovers that there are 7 other people who have \"powers\" within the school, hence the name of the anime. I'll stop talking about the plot now, the rest is up to you to see for yourself.\r\nI feel that there were some parts where you could see what was going to happen and the ending was very cliche (imo), howeverthe story made me keep anticipating for the next episode.

            "content": "Short:\r\nThe anime felt very rushed compared to the manga. Everyone seems to instantly respond to every action, thus losing much of the impact and emotion between exchanges. Some of the manga parts seemed to be added in just because it was in the manga, except some of the preludes were completely skipped which made it seemed very forced. Overall, I didn't really like this adaptation as it felt more like a summary of the manga than an actual fully fleshed anime.\r\n*Spoilers Ahead*\r\nStory: 7\r\nThis comes from the fact that we seem to be missing a few chunks of the story here and there probably due tothe episode limitations. The whole searching for witches and yamada's reasons felt very superficial where he does things just because the story needs him as the protagonist, rather than him having actual reasons.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9:\\n\r\nI felt that the art truly reflected the original's, not to mention that I feel it's actually a bit better. Miki (the author/artist) occasionally had some issues with the art, which I didn't notice here.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8:\\n\r\nDidn't really like the OP or ED songs. The voice selections suited their characters, though maybe the president could have been someone different, not really sure who, but I felt that his voice didn't really suit the character. For BGM, there wasn't much that caught my attention.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6:\\n\r\nLike stated earlier, everything just felt rushed. Their characters don't really feel fleshed out and everything they do don't really coincide with their character because we weren't given enough information beforehand (e.g. Miyamura's sister was actually a secret he wanted to keep but just stated it to everyone without much of an issue). I really felt that they should have adapted less of the manga and do each episode more thoroughly. \\n\r\n--Example 1: Yamada refuses to rejoin the Supernatural Club because he believes they're better off without him, but this isn't actually explained in the anime.\\n\r\n--Example 2; Yamada also runs through a few thoughts before confessing to Shiraishi but this is skipped in the anime for some reason, which makes the confession really random/abrupt.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nIt wasn't as enjoyable as the manga as everything happened way too quick without much time for people to really grasp the mood. It really felt like we were just skipping from scene to scene and being fed the main points of each scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7:\\n\r\nFirst anime I've watched where I've read the manga beforehand, so maybe I'm being a bit harsh. But it was definitely less enjoyable watching the anime than it was reading the manga. There was a real lack of romantic atmosphere between Yamada and Urara kissing. Perhaps even the voice acting was a bit rushed. Overall, I think there really should have been a few moments where each important character could engage in a short thought monologue.",

            "content": "A great anime I discovered not later than yesterday.\r\nIt basically is a mix between high-school / romance / harem / fantasy-magic themes, but the main theme which shines remains love. \r\nI won't sum up the story but just give my own appreciation. Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo has an original story but its best part is surely the character's development and the way they make everybody attractive (in the meaning of 'I wanna know more about him / her'). Sadly but logically, only the main characters (count Yamada, Shiraishi, Miyamura, Itou & Nene later on) will be on the front of the scene. Talking aboutthat, the last 2 witches' background remained really unknown, compared to the other ones.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, the other witches will have their dedicated episode (full duration, fortunately) but some won't be seen before the final episode, or at least, seen for a second in any other one. I can't blame this choice because an episode only takes 24-25 minutes but still, I would have appreciated to see them again, to learn more about everyone. Even though, I can't say there is a lack of information of those, concerning the main part of their background (aka, how did every witch get her power). \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, it is a very good entertainment, mixed with both magic and realistic context... but when you think about it slowly, you can easily guess it could happen to anyone on Earth. To make it quick, every witch gains her power once she falls in a quite sad situation. For example, one wanted to be involved in groups, in a highschool regular life but couldn't, so she gained the power seduce anyone. In that way, she gained 'friends' (more like servants) and was able to become more important.\\n\\n\r\nBut once we learn this part, we kinda feel sad for her, 'cause she was desperate. This is surely the routine of many students, no matter the age. You can only have empathy for all the witches, knowing that. The ending was really satisfying, considering it puts an end to a sad situation (in fact, everybody finishes friend with everybody and we can consider no one else inside the group will end up alone).\\n\\n\r\nSo, I recommend this anime for its plot and the very good development of characters. But don't forget that even if it is only an invented story, it also represents the daily life of many people around the world, and they don't have magic powers to help themselves. All the witches are kinda left alone, either because of their inability to speak with strangers or because other people can really tough, especially with younger than 'em. So give a hand whenever you see someone in the same situations, eh !",

            "content": "TL;DR: Rushed as f*ck.\r\nNo spoilers here.\r\nYamada-kun and the 7 Witches was one of the anime that I was dreading this season. Why? Because it was one-cour. The story arc that could be concluded with the manga as it is now is either over 80 chapters in or an original ending, and with the sweet spot of manga to anime adaptation being 2-3 chapters an episode, 80 could be a little too much in 24 episodes, even if filler is cut. Well, for better and for worse, Yamada-kun met and exceeded my expectations.\r\nBut let\u2019s talk about the good stuff first.\r\nYamada-kun and the 7 Witches (which Iwill abbreviate as 7 Witches) follows the titular Ryu Yamada, a second year delinquent who is all alone in a rather prestigious school. When walking up the stairs threateningly near the class genius and beauty, the diminutive Urara Shiraishi, he accidentally falls down the stairs on top of her. To their extreme surprise, they switched bodies. After walking in each other shoes, Yamada realizes Shiraishi is being bullied and, against her will, helps put an end to it. They then discover they can switch back by kissing. Subsequently, Yamada and Shiraishi get embroiled within the contest for Student Council President, create the Supernatural Studies Club, and search for the 7 Witches, who have powers similar to body-swapping.\\n\\n\r\nPremise aside, 7 Witches\u2019 key strengths are its art and extremely ball-busting humor, drawing from ecchi, physical, character-driven, and wordplay based humor. The anime always succeeds here. Linden does a tremendous job in animating here, making the environments of Suzaku High School seem especially grand and high-class. Many girls have extremely strange hair colors (green, blue, pink, whatever), and while they appear strange in the manga, Linden does a pretty good job at making them seem less jarring in the anime. Facial expressions are rendered extremely carefully, elevating the humor, which is usually done right. Aside from kissing, there is some playful fanservice here, and while it does get grating, the anime, in adapting, skips out on some of the fanservice as well, which is actually a plus, especially for those who are averse to such elements.\\n\\n\r\nThe true star of this entire anime is by far the voice work. I have to give amazing credit to the characters who generally swap bodies: Ryota Ohsaka (Yamada), Saori Hayami (Shiraishi), Toshiki Masuda (Toranosuke Miyamura) and Maaya Uchida (Miyabi Ito). When the characters swap bodies, each voice actor immediately switches their delivery to match the personality currently inhabiting their character. Hayami, who typically does quitter or gentler female roles, becomes bombastic and crude when Yamada is in Shiraishi\u2019s body. Similarly, whenever Shiraishi inhabits Yamada, Ohsaka delivers in a very terse and gentle tone. Masuda and Uchida also do a splendid job when body swapping is going on, but Ohsaka and Hayami are, without question, amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the voice cast does an amazing job, because 7 Witches\u2019 voice cast is stacked. To single out some of the biggest names here, Eri Kitamura voices Nene Odagiri, Aoi Yuki voices Noa Takigawa, Kana Hanazawa voices Mikoto Asuka, Daisuke Ono voices Ushio Igarashi, Miyuki Sawashiro voices Leona Miyamura, and Jun Fukuyama voices Student Council President Haruma Yamazaki. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where the praise stops, because Linden decided to make this one-cour instead of two.\\n\\n\r\nThe original 7 Witches manga had some filler that could have been taken out without too much trouble. A subplot with the girls\u2019 archery club president, Karen Kimishima, was cut out, and ultimately, that does not matter. Some arcs could be cut a little shorter without too much trouble, such as the arc focusing around Maria Sarushima or the arc surrounding Noa. But 7 Witches wasn\u2019t filled with so much fluff to be able to cut much more than this, so the amount of corner-cutting when it comes to plot make certain developments jarring and eliminates the impact of some of the arcs.  \\n\r\n(Some subtle foreshadowing sprinkled within the early chapters that reference the ongoing arc in the manga are cut entirely, so if that\u2019s ever adapted, it will seem less clever and more out of left field.)\\n\\n\r\nThe final arc of the anime was a rushed and hollow shadow of what was in the manga, which is a severe disappointment. Due to this corner cutting, all characters other than Yamada (and to a much lesser extent, Shiraishi) that had character development don\u2019t have any. Admittedly, some characters don\u2019t have much character development still don\u2019t, like Ito, Kentaro Tsubaki, and a couple of the witches. However, other characters lose both their motivations and screentime, making them hollow shells of people and not actual characters. The best way to describe this is in quick list form.\\n\\n\r\n-Shiraishi loses her dry, cutting humor, making her more generic.\\n\r\n-Toranosuke Miyamura\u2019s motivation in the manga doesn\u2019t exist in the anime.\\n\r\n-Leona Miyamura\u2019s motivation is heavily watered down.\\n\r\n-Odagiri\u2019s, Ushio\u2019s, Noa\u2019s, and Yamazaki\u2019s cut scenes make them more one-dimensional in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nYamada is pretty much the only major character to come through the adaptation unscathed, but with the other characters being rather weak, it prevents the anime from being a good adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nMany adaptations come in too soon and have to rush or make an original ending. This was not that. Linden\u2019s rushed 12 episode adaptation of Yamada made it lose most of its plot and character based strengths. More than a faithful retelling, it often feels like a highlights reel of the plot. The presentation is beyond stellar, but when the plot and characters are diluted to such an extent, it\u2019s hard to be happy with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5 (premise is OK to begin with, anime cuts down on many strengths)\\n\r\nArt - 8 (beautiful animation)\\n\r\nSound - 9 (music is forgettable but the voice acting is amazing)\\n\r\nCharacter - 5 (all characters except Yamada are hollow)\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4 (as a manga lover, this rushed adaptation hurts)\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6.2 (rounded to 6)\\n\\n\r\nEdit 7/6/15: Decided my score was a tad reactionary.\\n",

Or maybe you've thought about invisibility, dreaming of traumatic events, or even erasing memories? Still not impressed? Well, what if you had to KISS someone in order to use one of those seven powers? Mm-hmm, I think I've caught your attention now.\r\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to my review of Yamada and the Seven Witches, also known in Japanese as Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo.\r\nYamada-kun and the Seven Witches is about Ryuu Yamada, a delinquent inhis second year at Suzaku High School. One day, he accidentally falls down a flight of stairs, crashing into the school's top student, Urara Shiraishi, in the process. When Yamada regains consciousness, he discovers that he has switched bodies with Shiraishi. When they switch back, they discover that kissing causes them to switch bodies. It is later discovered that there are seven witches at Suzaku High School, each of them possessing a unique power. Together with the newly-revived Supernatural Studies Club, they set out to discover the identities of these seven witches.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I've never read the manga before, I've known about it for quite a while because of its popularity. That's why when the anime was announced, I jumped at the chance to watch it. I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd hoped I would, but it still turned out to be a great anime in all other aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is well put-together, and I liked that it focused on powers other than body swapping. Each of the characters were developed quite well, especially the witches. You cannot forget the main characters, though. Yamada was a fun character from beginning to end, and Shiraishi was quite an interesting one. The other members of the Supernatural Studies Club, Miyamura (the student council vice president), Itou (the supernatural-obsessed girl), and Tsubaki (a transfer student who is introduced later), each have their moments of brilliance or hilariousness.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was done very well, and each voice actor fit their character as well as possible. I didn't care for the ending theme, \"Candy Magic\", that much, but I absolutely LOVE the opening, \"Kuchizuke Diamond\"! It's very catchy and well-sung; it's easily one of the best opening themes of the season where it aired. The best part of this anime, though, was the animation. It was so vivid and well-done!\\n\\n\r\nThinking about it, I wonder why I didn't enjoy Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches so much, because what is there not to like about it? I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the manga. Or maybe I should read the manga myself and see if the anime was any different from it? I don't know.",

            "content": "Okay guys, so this is my very first review so if something is bothering you, please tell me right away. \r\nAs an introduction, I have to say than before beginning watching Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches, I already had read all of the available volumes of the manga ( though it's still ongoing ). I am a big fan of this manga and I was waiting for this series with great excitment.\r\nStory : 8/10\r\nSo, yeah basically it kinda looks that it will be your typical school harem with a non-existant plot but then a very interesting concept showed up : the switching body power andsome other which are possesed by different witches, seven witches all gathered in this school ( one power per witch. ). \\n\r\nYou can think that the fact of having seven girls in this anime makes it a harem but you're wrong, the love plot is only developped between Shiraishi and Yamada. Besides, some witches appears only in their arc episodes and they end up having a little part in the big story while Shiraishi stay all along. \\n\r\nThe anime follows the main story of the manga but leaves behind some points :\\n\\n\r\n- First, the fanservice. The only fanservice of the anime is Yamada and Miyamura joking about touching Shiraishi's boobs when they switch bodies with her + 1 or 2 scenes when a character drop off his clothes for some weirds reason, so pretty light fanservice if you know that the manga features a lot of more perverted scenes ( Basically, Ecchi. ) So no big fanservice as a casual ecchi would do.\\n\\n\r\n- Second, a LOT of very funny scenes was not shown. Most of these scenes don't really have a big influence on the main story, but some would definitely help to understand the plot in a better way.\\n\\n\r\n-Third, I have the impression that they just decide to give up on the \" Gender Bender \" ( cause yes, a boy in the body of a girl and a girl in the body of a boy is gender bender ) idea which is very well developped in the manga and which helps improving the developpement of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nI just wanna tell you that if you are complaining about the lack of character development and the rush in the anime, read the manga it will be way better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 7/10\\n\r\nA deliquent guy being the main lead is quite common in this type of anime and the fact that he is having a relationship with a top student ( in order to create a contrast between the two which I find lovely ) is sure an already used idea but most of the other characters are over-stereotyped. I have to mention Miyamura as a great and very funny character. \\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\r\nNot very outstanding art for a very recent anime but still very nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nAudio : 8/10\\n\r\nI have never skipped the OP once and the ED is decent. However, I did not find the OST great, in fact I even did not notice it.\\n\r\nVoice acting is GREAT, the seiyuus have done a wonderful job to alter their voices when their character was in an other character's body.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment : 9/10\\n\r\nYou cannot say that I was very surprised by this anime as I have already read the manga but it is still great to discover the animated version of a manga you like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8/10\\n\r\nI am splited between the fact than I love the original story and the impression that it was really really rushed. \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you are looking for a light hearted romcom with a touch of supernatural go ahead and you will be not disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for having read my review. ^^\\n",

            "content": "At first i really didnt know if i would like this anime or not. When i started it i felt like well this is gonna be just another harem that will end with him and all of his girls. But i so wrong. lol This is my favorite romance anime of the summer by far. There are 7 witches in this school and each of them have a different power. The main character is know as a \"witch killer\" i suppose is what they called him. Which copys the power of the witch that he had recently kiissed. You get attched to all of thecharacters after you hear their story and why they struggled and how they got their powers. In  the end he ends up with one girl when all of the other girls like him which is technically still a harem but it kind of isnt. lol My  favorite charcter was Odigiri the girl with the purple hair. She was too cute. lol This is a story of how a dilinquit boy comes out of being a loner and making friends along the way. It is quite a love story if you like that kind of thing. Would recommend.",

            "content": "A solidly entertaining adaptation, with a strong start and characters that grab your attention. Yamada is a solid/amusing main character whose commentary/narrative adds to the story rather then screwing it up.\r\nHowever, it loses some of its appeal once you figure out that every single female character is going to be thirsty for the MC's dick. Rather then sticking to making an interesting supernatural story and focusing on the main romantic pairing, they waste time having every female character magically fall in love with a fairly average/easily dislikable considering his attitude guy.\r\nWhen the show is on track, it's an interesting tale/study of how receiving supernatural powercould affect people, how people aren't always what they seem on the surface, etc. When it's wasting time having the other witches rub on Yamada and moan about the strange feelings they're having instead of actually developing them as characters, it significantly weighs down the anime.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended with reservations. If you seriously can't stand harem you're probably going to have a bad time. For everyone else, especially harem fans, it's a pretty good time.",

            "content": "A likeable ecchi harem anime at last!I am thoroughly impressed that there is something of this genre that I actually enjoyed.I did enjoy Kore wa zombie desu ga  though for the comedy.But this one is more romance oriented and it has plot,well,both kinds\r\nStory(7/10)\r\nThe theme in one word is kissing.Everything(almost) is solved through kissing.Do you like to see smoochies?Then this is perfect for you!Oh,and if you are homophic that ain't good 'cause there is all kinds of action.\r\nFirst half is mostly the introduction of characters and the creation of the ''Supernatural Studies Club'' and of course, finding out our protagonist's weird power while the secondis kind of episodic because of the discovering of the six other witches and the schools secret if I may call it so.The story objective was quite simple:find the witches,solve their problems and kiss them.Why that?Three of the characters:Yamada(the yankee MC),Shiraishi(the quiet bookworm and main love interest),Itou(the girl who joins them because of her intrigue with supernatural and want to be popular are curious.Miyamura though(the student council member who found out about their powers and initiated the club) wants to do that because he wants to be pres of their school.It was interesting though that it wasn't just all that because the witches powers come from the wishes emerged from what they lack:Shiraishi body switching because she literally wanted to be in someone else's shoes,Nene charm power because of her tsundere and self-centered attitude and so on.Surprisingly,even if it was simple,the plot wasn't exceedingly predictable.Because towards the end when the last witch was revealed,everything made sense.The president's motive for his obssesion on finding the witches was finally found out and even if our protagonist fails horribly at school he at least had the brains to make the right wish for everyone to be happy and regain what they lost.It's also very,very pleasing that it actually doesn't end abruptly and Yamada actually ends up going out with his loved one.\\n\r\nAlso bonus points for not overusing fan service.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nIt feels like Lucy and Natsu and Gray with Juvia made kids when we weren't looking! Shiraishi and Yamada look a lot like them and even their personality is alike.As in many other anime,the characters each had a color assigned to them.I'm surprised Shiraishi doesn't have white hair,most kuuderes have that quirk but this is in fact a good thing,it's overused anyway.Even if this is a harem and of course the girls are pretty,cute and have big plot,the guys don't look half-bad either.Especially Miyamura,I have a thing for silver haired boys.The character's design is what stood out the most,the backgrounds didn't really.\\n\\n\r\nSound(7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are cuute and sweet,I like them but I don't think they are memorable or anything.The VAs fit the character's personalities even if none of them stood out for me or were my favorites.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nFor a harem anime,the characters were surprisingly well made.Though Yamada is incredibly stupid in school and doesn't have to much tact when it comes on how to treat a girl,he is NOT dense.He does realise he loves someone and I am proud of his decisiveness.Miyamura,his sidekick,of course is a pervert to boot but he has the talent to attract ladies more or less even with his lecherous attitude.I suspect something going on with Itou later on...Shiraishi is the quiet girl who gets bullied but because of Yamada's help her life gets better and she's able to enjoy her school life and make friends,thing which applies in the MCs case as well.The other girls were mostly there to advance the story,the only one who actually had a crush on Yamada was Nene while most only admired him because of his help.Even the president(and the 7th witch) who are intended to be the antagonists and to be hated have their reasons for doing what they do and are to be emphatised.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI have enjoyed this much more than I would have thought and I liked it.Probably my favorite harem series besides the reverse ones.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nVery good indeed for this genre.I recommend it to anyone who wants a good harem,comedy or romance series.\\n",

            "content": "[MY DAD'S CAR HAS SPOILERS, SO DOES THIS]\r\nYamada-kun to Nananin no Majo was the second anime I recall ever watching. It was quite a treat and I really enjoyed it, and even recommended it to a couple of friends. But why? Well, just read below to find out.\r\n[STORY]\r\nHave you ever space out in class, only to find yourself thinking \"I wonder what I would do if I could switch bodies with someone?\" only to go on tangents that aren't MAL-appropriate to write? Because Yamajo explores just that idea, and it explores it in a strange way. The story is that the school that Yamada goesto has a set of 7 witches that have all sorts of strange abilities, such as body-switching, force-falling-in-love, telepathy, freezing time, and precognition. He trips on a stair-case, and body switches with Urara Shiraishi (:3), and realises this when he wakes up in the infirmary. +40 points for the fact that the first thing he does is go to the bathroom and take off his clothes, which is what we all know we would do. The ending is decent and well done, and all the relationships (Ushio-Nene or Urara-Yamada) are really fun to ship. Any minor side stories (e.g. the school trip) were also a good watch for the plainly funny humour it involved.\\n\\n\r\n[ART] \\n\r\nSomething I found to be a pretty good factor in the series was the art. For example, the shade of Ushio/Miyamura's and Yamada's hair was strikingly better than what I would've normally happened (grey and brown hair respectively) - because we all know that the art of a show can be judged solely by the hair colours of two characters. This isn't some sort of Sistine Chapel painting, but it has better animation than a lot of anime out there.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND]\\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty well done (especially that of Urara), but the OP theme is one of my favourites in anime as a whole. WEAVER really performed \"Kuchizuke Diamond\" excellently to the point that I bought their CD to be imported from Japan to the UK. The ED song is also quite good, although, in my opinion, not quite as good as the aforementioned OP. BGM is standard.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTERS]\\n\r\nThe characters involve : \\n\r\n+ Badman McBadGrades - Yamada\\n\r\n+ GoodGrades McWaifu - Urara Shiraishi (WITCH)\\n\r\n+ Smugfuck Smartypants - Nene Odagiri (WITCH)\\n\r\n+ Gaylord McHomo  - It's obvious if you watch it\\n\r\n+ Nobodycares Weirdfacts - Itou\\n\r\nAnd of course the witches themselves, which have very distinct and often well executed personalities + voicing and such that matches the character's appearance. Ootsuka best dandere.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\nI definitely think it was a worthwhile watch and would recommend it to anyone new to anime. It might not be as known or popular as, say, DragonBall Z or One Piece, but it's well executed enough that it deserves a high rating and more viewership. I happily viewed the OVA (And super-short ONA) later, because I really liked the world that this was set in, and the environment of Suzuka High.\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\nDefinitely something I would recommend. It has lovable characters (besides the ones you're not supposed to like), an interesting form of telling the story, decent voice acting and you can see that work was actually put into this to make it good and worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nRated \"U\" for \"Urara is adorable (and we need to make a real-life clone of her)\".",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review so please be gentle lol. \r\nMay contain little spoilers.\r\nStory- 7/10\r\n   The anime's story is nothing new. We've seen this kind of plot before, but I  myself am new to this. I gotta admit kinda liked how they went with it. It was very intriguing to me and it kept me hooked. The balance of comedy and getting to a bit of a serious tone was quite good for me. My problems with it is that I wanted to know more about the world. Where the witch powers comes from, the history of the Supernaturalclub and the history of the past members. I think all this could've been solved if there were more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 8/10\\n\\n\r\n   Bright colors, colorful characters and a pretty atmosphere. It felt lively when it needed, had the nice contrast when the characters are faced with dilemma and the emotions on the characters' faces are well illustrated.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 7/10\\n\\n\r\n   The OP is really good and really catchy. The ED is really cute too, both in terms of music and sequence. There were some nice background music that stood out but overall nothing memorable. It did, however, fit the series well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9/10\\n\\n\r\n   Shiraishi! The characters are definitely the reason you'd want to keep watching the anime. The MC Yamada is such a funny dude, but when things hit the fan, he doesn't mess around. Shiraishi is my favorite character in the series. She's so cute and adorable, and strong. I love how Yamada and Shirashi's relationship develop. The other members of the Supernatural Club were also very funny and interesting. The other witches were cute and had unique abilities too, and some of them stood out. \\n\\n\r\n   That said, there are witches that only had one-off episodes. It would've been nice to know more of them, or atleast just see them interact with the main crew more often. There was one witch though (the 6th one) that I hoped they explored a bit more. Also, as mentioned earlier, I wish they told us more about the old Supernatural Club's past, as well as the 7th's mystery and all that. I didn't feel like the show's Antagonist really felt like one because of these reasons. Then again, one of the major reasons for these is that there is too little episodes. I wish there'd be a season 2!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10\\n\\n\r\n   Definitely one of my favorite I've seen this year! I love the characters, especially Yamada and Shiraishi, and the situations that they get into are all hilarious. I also enjoyed discovering the other witch's powers and was looking forward to seeing how Yamada would deal with them. I definitely wish there'd be a second season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8.2/10\\n\\n\r\n   Personally, I'd ignore all the problems I had with it and just blame it all on lack of episodes and give it a 10/10 but then again I believe that there may still be other things that I may have overlooked because I just enjoyed the anime so much. \\n\\n\r\n   Overall, Yamada-kun is a very good anime for me. It's plot is nothing very new or unique but it's cast of characters are fun and interesting, and the it is a very enjoyable watch. It has decent animation, and really good OP with a cute ED. Also, Urara Shiraishi is reason enough to watch it. There are plot holes, characters that aren't well developed but it can be associated with the little amount of episodes that it had, though it is your prerogative if you want to make that the reason or not. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTo those who read this review, thank you very much.\\n\r\nThis is my first one, and I hope it was at least remotely helpful.\\n\r\nIf you have yet to see this anime, then I highly recommend it.\\n\r\nIf you have finished this anime and maybe trying to find an anime similar to this, I recommend D-Frag.\\n\\n\r\nHave a good day! :D",

            "content": "I guess I have to go through the spiel and say I've never written a review before...\r\nAnyways, first and foremost, this anime is one of the best animes I have watched in a long time.  It DEFINITELY is NOT a harem even though its tagged as that in the genres.  Second this anime exceeded all my expectations of a cheesy magic or plain gender bending anime.  \r\nThe anime has great:\r\n- Characters\r\n- Art\r\n- Plot\r\n- COMEDY \r\n- suspense\r\nThe characters actually all have different personalities and contribute to the story.  The art is pretty but also average, however,I believe that this aids the watcherin focusing on the story and the characters.  AND theres a strong Plot!(That's rare.) Along with tasteful comedy befitting this anime.  Plus the plot holds multi layers of story that are told in 12 short episodes. \\n\\n\r\nIf you try this anime I am sure you will enjoy it but give it at least 3 or 4 episodes since it starts out slow introducing characters each episode, similar to most animes with a large character base.  \\n\\n\r\nAlso I have read that the manga is still ongoing and that the ending may be different from what the manga intended and is anime original.  I do not believe that the ending was bad if this is the case since it wraps up nicely and doesn't leave you with the WTF feeling most short animes leave you with.  I only feel the urge to read the manga to see how it is different from the anime and to see more of the characters.  The anime's ending did not leave me with the cliff hanger feeling where I needed to continue into the manga immediately to get the rest of the story.\\n\\n\r\nHope this helps! \\n\r\nPS: It's really great anime :D",

            "content": "I have three words to say about the anime \"Yamada-kun and the seven witches\":\r\nRushed, Romantic, Kisses.\r\nIn this anime, there are seven witches, each witch wields another power as you can guess.\r\nAnd guess what, \"The pair discover they can switch bodies with a kiss\" (from the synopsis). \r\nThe problem with this anime is that it was EXTREMELY RUSHED. It was a lot of plot and things to put, in 12 episodes (It would be one of the top #50 maybe if it was in more episodes).\r\nThis anime didn't have much of a story line, they were trying to find the identities of the witches, and theproblems and things that happen with it.\\n\r\nStory 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful, relaxing, and warm.\\n\r\nArt 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP was AMAZING, relaxing, nice, addicting, and I haven't skipped it even once!\\n\r\nSound 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were interesting, many ships of couples could happen here, and the relationships were shown well.\\n\r\nThe characters didn't have a deep personality and past, but they DID have some.\\n\r\nThey characters' personalities were various and interesting.\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment- 8/10.\\n\r\nThere were 3 main genres in this anime- Romance, Supernatual and School.\\n\r\nGenres: \\n\r\nComedy[V/X]- It wasn't too funny, but had funny parts.\\n\r\nHarem[V/X]- Well, it did have some Harem, but not too much, and it's better that the Harem wasn't a big part of the anime.\\n\r\nMystery[X]- Nothing was \"mystery\", many of the things were found out quickly, since the anime was rushed.\\n\r\nRomance[VV]- Ooh yea, that was executed pretty well, and is the best genre in this anime.\\n\r\nSchool[V]-Yup, this anime is almost always in school. Has clubs and school council.\\n\r\nSupernatural[V]- All the idea of supernatual powers, and it being centre was executed well.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended: To those who search for a lighthearted romance, and mostly if you search for KISSES (THERE ARE MANY).\\n\\n\r\nNot Recommended: If you look for a deep, slow paced anime or if you look for a decent Harem (Harem as main genre).",

            "content": "Now how does this sound: another school life harem with witches who have to be saved by the shows main character, who is single. This sounds like at least a dozen bad harem anime we've all seen. The fan service going rampant, the characters completely forgettable, and the ending ambiguous at best, leading it up to the fans on who the main character ends up with. That, however, is not at all this show. I understand why it has the harem tag, however, it doesn't fit in that category as much as you'd think. It's a fast paced, action packed romance, filled with mystery, cleverplans, fighting, and of course, romance. And it had me gripping my seat at times, ready to watch how they got out of the next problem. Is it perfect, no, but it might just make it on my top ten, and that says alot.\\n\r\n\tCharacters: Let's start with the show's strong suit. Very few of these characters were cookie cutter, I'd argue none were. While no one character struck me as gold, all of them combined, each shining in their own way, made this series truly great.\\n\r\n\tSetting: This is a high school anime. A setting we've all seen a crazy amount of times. But this time, something interesting is all the magic and weirdness comes FROM the school. Despite being one campus, it manages to keep coming up with new, fresh areas, avoiding too many of the same areas unlike some anime.\\n\r\n\tStory: Now, this is normally a weak point of romance anime. Usually it just focuses on the love birds falling in love, being stopped by coincidence and comedic timing, climax of the story and a kiss (if you're lucky). This show laughs at such an idea and gives you kissing. Lots of it. Guy kissing girl. Guy kissing guy. Girl kissing girl. Guy kissing guy, again. And the story itself focuses on romance as a secondary, rather focusing on it's own story of a competition for Student Council President chair, discovering witches, and the budding friendships and relationships of ALL of the characters. \\n\r\nI've heard complaints that the story is rushed, and yeah, you could argue that. It's a complex story already and it condenses way more manga than it should into 12 episodes. However, if you can follow along, it's a very good watch.\\n\r\n\tTHIS IS A COMPLETE STORY. Don't get me wrong, there is more after in the manga, but this anime actually has an end, with a full climax that wraps up most of the questions brought up in that season. The stuff afterwards is just more. I'm not sure where it will go, but you can bet I'm reading it after I finish writing this.\\n\r\n\t\tTL;DR The story is top notch for harems, the characters are all fairly interesting, the series is one full story with a satisfying conclusion, and a ship actually sails in the end, with several hinting at having the chance to fly later on. It's a romance, it's a mystery, and SWEET HALLELUJAH the main character isn't dense.",

I remember that one time a year ago, in July, my friend happened to recommend me to read/watch romance anime, since he was hooked on it. I started searching up some, and happened to come across this on kissanime, and I immediately got hooked. (I'm into Gender Bender anime too :3)\r\n-=[Review]=-\r\nStory 8/10 - The plot of the story was well thought out, imo, but it is super rushed. I happened to re-read s1 in the manga, and it was more descriptive. Personally, I would watch S1, then continue reading on in the manga.  The romancein the story is also lit, as it portrays it more vibrantly, with comedy when necessary.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10 - The animation team did a great job with the animation, unlike *cough* *cough* Toei, and they managed to make it really smooth. Although I didn't like the S1 art in the manga, the anime made up for it by putting in the more recent character art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10 - The voice acting was really good, as they took the time to get the expressions and the feelings in. The soundtrack overall was good, and the opening was stuck inside my head once I listened to it once. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10 - I feel, imo, that the character writing was well thought out, but at the same time, a little cliche. The story itself, about kissing and witch powers were creative, but the character development was the thing. But since it was my first rom-com, I'll let it slide.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 - It is fun seeing 2 people, getting to know each other, and also getting closer and closer. I would enjoy every rom-com I see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 - Everything was great, and I truly did enjoy it. This anime made me enjoy rom-coms in general. Yamada will always be remembered.",

While the anime starts off strong and very entertaining to watch, it starts to taper off towards the middle and then turns into an absolute train wreck at the end.\r\n\u201cFighting is not about your body, it\u2019s about your spirit!\u201d - Yamada Ryuu\r\nTL;DR\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nCharacter: 8/10\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\r\nOverall: 7/10\r\nWhat\u2019s Good?\r\n+ Large, varied, interesting cast of main and supporting characters\r\n+ Wonderfully hilarious character interactions\r\n+ Great emotion and romance\r\n+ Lots of kissing and pantsu\r\n+ Lots of cute girls\r\nWhat\u2019s Bad?\r\n- Very confusing and anti-climactic ending\r\n- Manyunexplained plot points and unanswered questions\\n\r\n- Lack of a meaningful overarching plot\\n\r\n- Underwhelming antagonistic characters\\n\\n\r\nWho should watch?\\n\r\n= People who love cute girls and non-excessive ecchi\\n\r\n= People who don\u2019t want an anime that\u2019s neither too serious nor too frivolous\\n\r\n= People who have a limited amount of time\\n\r\n= People who want to see yaoi and yuri all in one anime\\n\r\n= People who want a good laugh\\n\\n\r\n***SPOILERS AHEAD, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK***\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nYamada literally stumbles upon a beautiful girl, Shiraishi, at a staircase and accidentally ends up kissing her as he does so. This then causes them to switch bodies which is a result of Shiraishi\u2019s witch power and Yamada\u2019s innate ability to copy witch powers. As the story progresses and their romance blooms, they begin to find out more about other witches that exist in the school, with a total of 7, and embark on quest to find all seven witches in order to grant any wish they so please. The plot is hence subdivided into 7 different arcs based on each witch: Shiraishi Urara arc, Odagiri Nene arc, Ootsuka Meiko arc, Sarushima Maria arc, Takigawa Noa arc, Asuka/Tamaki arc and finally the Saionji Rika arc.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not very sure what to make of the overall story to be honest, since there is an absolute lack of any overarching conflict whatsoever and even though there seems to be a purposefulness in the actions of the main cast, they never truly amount to anything and seem slightly frivolous and trivial throughout the anime. Still, the anime did have its very gripping and exciting plot lines, in particular the one surrounding the old school building fire in the Sarushima arc. (+1 for excitement)\\n\\n\r\nMost of the arcs follow the same kind of pattern of meeting a girl, a witch who seems like a certain quirk on the outside. Then, through some situation or another, her weakness or vulnerability is revealed which not only helps Yamada better understand her, it also kind of makes the girl fall for him, in a classic harem style piece. Every witch seems to have a power that she wishes for or something that helps to compensate for something that she is lacking in everyday life, mostly revolving around the same few high school teenager problems like not being able to make friends in school, essentially. I can hardly say that any of it is original, even if they were entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the key parts that really saved the plot of this anime was the unexpected twist at the end, where Yamada finally puts an end to all of the witches\u2019 powers instead of merely just restoring everyone\u2019s memories. That seemed like a fitting end to wrap things up, especially when things were just going all over the place and there were many plot lines that were introduced but never revisited or tied together at the end. (+1 for plot twist)\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I do want to point out that the anime did a very good job foreshadowing this, with an earlier scene where Sarushima asks Yamada to find a way to erase her witch powers so that she can \u201cfall in love\u201d. This parallels Yamada\u2019s final arc quest the get Shiraishi to fall in love with him again, and hints toward the eventual erasure of all the witch powers because though they may seem useful at first, they are actually a hindrance to living out life to the fullest (+1 for deep meaning).\\n\\n\r\nIn the logic department, I can give the anime a little hope because at least all of the characters stayed true to their character in the anime, and none behaved in a non-realistic manner. Also, most of the witches powers were fairly believable and even interesting to see played out, or at least all except for the last one. (+1 for reasonable characters and believable powers)\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the final arc of this anime was so disappointing because it completely through common sense out of the window and introduced such an incredible amount of chaos that it became impossible to make sense of the anime after episode 9. As such, I have listed 8 plot holes in chronological order here, where it should be noted how most of them occur in the last few episodes:\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 3, Shiraishi states that she doesn\u2019t want to go to college because she wants to study on her own instead and doesn\u2019t need college. But this makes absolutely no sense at all because a large part of college is essentially a self-motivated study and research anyway. Even if this was not the real reason for Shiraishi not wanting to go to college, the fact that none of the other club members call her out on this lame excuse is an outright inconsistency.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 5, the last page of Volume 1 of the Seven Wonders of Suzaku High School lists only 2 of the witches\u2019 powers, stating that the others are to be revealed in the next volume. However, there is clearly a lot more space at the bottom of the page to at least write one or two more abilities. There does not seem to be any other reason than scripted unnecessary suspense to only list 2 abilities in the first volume and then continue with the others in the second volume, especially when there is still space left in the first book.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 10, Yamazaki states that they took special precautions with Yamada, but this means that Saionji Rika\u2019s power is not to erase the memories of a person she kisses, but to erase everyone else\u2019s memories of the person she kisses. However, we clearly see from Leona\u2019s account of her power that it is definitely the former instead, which then explains my present confusion: Which is it, really? Both? I feel like the anime is just conveniently changing the rules regarding this power to work in the inverse manner, and this just adds a very forced and unnecessary climax to the whole anime. This confusion persists to the end of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlso in episode 10, Yamazaki states clearly that only the student council president should know, but clearly his secretary Asuka Mikoto also knows and was not subject to the erasure since there are scenes where they clearly discuss matters about the seven witches in front of her.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 11, for strange reasons unknown to us, Yamada kissing a witch somehow restores her memories. For even stranger reasons, Rika\u2019s memory erasure powers do not work a second time on the same person. The anime realizes these two plot holes are so huge that they don\u2019t even bother trying to explain them whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 12, Rika states that she felt very lonely in school simply because everyone else except the student council president forgot about her every time she used her powers. But remember that Rika\u2019s powers only work once on everyone, and it\u2019s only a matter of time for her to reconnect with the people she really wants to again. It makes absolutely no sense why Yamazaki is the only person who can relearn about Rika\u2019s existence.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Rika states that time has stopped for everyone except Rika and Yamazaki. Again, the anime doesn\u2019t bother explaining why Rika is the exception out of all the witches. Rika then says that this is similar to the General Theory of Relativity, which makes absolutely no sense because Yamada would then have to be under the effect of some really intense gravitational force or be traveling at the speed of light, which is certainly not the case. This is a classic case of an anime trying to sound smart but really isn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, there are still a whole lot of other unanswered questions here. What really is the power of the seventh witch? Why are there seven witches in the first place and how did they come about? Where the heck is the rest of the student council and why do we only ever see 3 of them (Yamazaki, Odagiri, Miyamura) in the entire anime? What exactly does the second volume of the book say and where is it now? How did Tamaki and Yamada gain their special powers that allowed them to interact with the witches? Are these powers also transferable? Who did Sarushima want to fall in love with?\\n\\n\r\nThis whole host of unanswered questions really put the anime to shame, because it was doing so well until the end. Well, it was altogether an interesting plot but one that completely crumbled the moment the anime tried to make it any more serious than it was. It honestly could have been way better if it just stuck to being funny, but the attempt at creating a seriously gripping climax completely backfired.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 2/3 - I really enjoyed the wonderful animations they used here to make the funny parts even funnier. There were just certain parts where the animation felt a little jumpy at times.\\n\r\nAesthetics: 3/3 - The art was really good, especially the character designs!\\n\r\nOP Sequence: 2/2 - Really loved the OP Sequence!\\n\r\nED Sequence: 1/2 -The ED sequence wasn\u2019t as nice, but it was still good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Theme: 2/2 - Really loved the OP Theme!\\n\r\nED Theme: 2/2 - Absolutely loved the ED Theme!\\n\r\nBackground Music: 4/4\\n\r\nThe background music here was really good, and there was not a point where I thought the choice of music was awkward\\n\\n\r\nNo bonus points because there are no additional themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the main cast members were very well developed while there was a lot of room for development for the supporting cast. All of the characters however, were very varied and interesting while still being realistic.\\n\\n\r\nYamada Ryuu\\n\r\nAs a high school delinquent, we are introduced to a Yamada who is uncaring about everything around him. He doesn\u2019t care about his grades or about school in general and has a degree of crudeness that goes well with his tough guy attitude, intimidating many people around him with his fighting style (+1 for tornado kick). In spite of his apparent apathy towards many things, we slowly learn as the story progresses that Yamada actually cares a lot about food, and about the feelings of the girls around him, showing many times that he genuinely cares for each girl (+1 for multi-faceted nature). Also, his innate ability to copy witches abilities undoubtedly launches him into absolutely hilarious interactions with the witches in the story, and is incredibly entertaining to watch (+1 for interactions).\\n\\n\r\nShiraishi Urara\\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Shiraishi is presented as the top student of her school, though not everything is as smooth sailing as it seems. She is being bullied by others who are envious of her results and she\u2019s also a bit of a social outcast because she consistently passes on school trips to spend time alone studying. She is incredibly calm and collected, being the exact antithesis of Yamada, and thus also his best match throughout the anime. It is not surprise then, that their relationship strengthens throughout the story and they bring out the best in each other, even to the point of self-sacrifice (+1 for relationship growth). It is also worth pointing out that Shiraishi also loves cute things, as shown through her cute-themed bedroom and the fact that she can stare at her own panties simply \u201cbecause they are cute\u201d (+1 for cuteness).\\n\\n\r\nMiyamura Toranosuke\\n\r\nAlthough he does not have a special power in the story, Toranosuke is one of the most entertaining characters to watch. As the not-so-secret pervert who does hilariously funny perverted things, he is really the character that makes me laugh the most, and it would be an absolute loss to the anime if this character did not exist. From his signature obsession with panties, to his habit of attempting to undress Yamada in Shiraishi\u2019s body, he really should be the one getting slapped by Odagiri instead of Yamada.\\n\\n\r\nItou Miyabi\\n\r\nAs another character who is powerless, Itou\u2019s strengths lies in her partnership with Toranosuke to create humour in the anime. She is also the first one to have a touching backstory to her, where it is revealed that she is a social outcast because she spouts nonsense about the supernatural and nobody believes her, even to the point of nearly getting herself killed by a bunch of thugs (+1 for backstory). After being saved by Yamada though, we begin to see Itou as a very amiable and lively person who is always one of the few who injects energy into any situation they are in.\\n\\n\r\nOdagiri Nene\\n\r\nWhile Odagiri starts off as the scheming rival of Miyamura, she eventually warms up to the rest of the cast after we begin to see a little of her vulnerabilities. She\u2019s quite the tsundere and especially so when she was under the effect of her own charm power due to Yamada\u2019s copying ability. Her role in the anime really goes beyond her own little arc though, as she becomes instrumental to creating a plan and finding a way to defeat Yamazaki in the final arc. Odagiri was even willing to suffer on her own for the benefit of Yamada\u2019s happiness, which I really think was one of the most touching moments of the anime. It is no wonder that Ushio fell for her even without being under the charm spell. Nothing really brings you closer to tears in the anime than this purple-haired beauty (+1 character depth).\\n\\n\r\nIgarashi Ushio\\n\r\nSince Ushio is an old friend of Yamada and fellow tough guy, you\u2019d expect him to at least be as interesting as Yamada is. Well, he is not. He betrayed him once to willingly fall in love with Odagiri Nene for very unclear reasons and in so doing, gave Yamada his bad reputation in the school. Ushio and Yamada kind of become sworn enemies from then on and although this was fixed in the Odagiri arc, nothing much else about Ushio\u2019s character develops. From the start, we could tell that he was fixatedly loyal towards Odagiri, to the point of love, and it was very obvious that he would continue to do so whether or not he was under the charm effect.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the witches, Otsuka Meiko, Sarushima Maria, Takigawa Noa, Asuka Mikoto and Saionji Rika are all relegated to the supporting cast and so we don\u2019t get to see much of their backstories fleshed out. It is a little disappointing that I didn\u2019t get to hear much about Sarushima\u2019s after story however, because she was definitely the most interesting out of the 5 of them, having been the first one to ask to have her own powers removed because she wanted to \u201cfall in love\u201d and also the one with probably the most useful witch power ever (we are only left wondering why she did not use this power to win lotteries). \\n\\n\r\nMiyamura Leona\\n\r\nAt this point I really want to mention my favourite character of the entire anime, Leona. Leona is Toranosuke\u2019s really hot sister who doesn\u2019t mind stripping down to her underwear at a moment\u2019s notice and that\u2019s not even the best part of her. The best part is that she is probably the most useful character in the entire anime who essentially has all of the answers than Yamada and crew are searching for throughout the entire anime. She is also extremely clever, can throw scissors with excellent precision and is someone you absolutely do not mess with (+1 for badassery). It is really a shame that she is only a supporting character, because she has such a rich backstory that I think the anime doesn\u2019t do her enough justice. From her brief mention of her previous involvement in the Supernatural Research Club with Yamazaki and her experiences uncovering the identities of the witches, it is certain that there is so much more depth to this character than what the anime has shown us. I would have liked to see a lot more of that Yamazaki - Leona interaction which would have really added to the development of both their characters.\\n\\n\r\nYamazaki Haruma\\n\r\nAs the pseudo-antagonist of the story, Yamazaki was admittedly disappointing. He initially seems like a mystical student council president with a mischievous yet sinister air around him and as the story goes, it becomes obvious that he seems to be hatching some evil scheme. While there is a certain backstory to him, we don\u2019t learn this until at the very end when Leona reveals this, and so Yamazaki was always this spectre of uncertainty. Even in the end, when he had a change of heart from Leona\u2019s words, the anime did not really bring out the emotions in him to actually convince us of his turnaround. In the end, it really felt Yamazaki had really poor motives of going against the club members, as simply trying to control the school isn\u2019t really cutting it.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast, which includes Tsubaki Kentarou and Tamaki Shinichi are also very interesting characters, but they do not show up long enough in the anime to really make any impact. Tsubaki as a character seems completely random and Tamaki just seems completely underused although he has such a useful ability. It\u2019s really a shame.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nHumour\\n\r\nThe anime was probably the most hilarious in the first few episodes where Yamada is still figuring out the extent of his powers. The funniest segment was most likely in episode 2, when the Supernatural Research Club members begin kissing each other regardless of gender and swapping bodies to absolutely hilarious effect with yaoi and yuri moments all rolled into one. All of Miyamura\u2019s perverted antics deserve a mention here. Also, Yamada rearranging his name to become Dayama at the fortune telling booth was simply too much for my stomach to handle. I really enjoyed the comic aspect of this anime! (+3 for comedy)\\n\\n\r\nEmotion\\n\r\nI especially loved the emotions that played in the Odagiri Nene arc, which lent itself very well to Odagiri\u2019s own charm power. I also loved how we had the chance to see some romance blossoming in a total of three couples in this show: Yamada-Shiraishi, Odagiri-Ushio and Leona-Yamazaki. (+2 for romance)\\n\\n\r\nSuspense\\n\r\nThe anime also did an especially good job at building up suspense for the final arc, with progressively more and more interesting witch powers and the entire plot line about trying to find the second volume of the book but always failing. Although the suspense was futile, it was suspense nonetheless. (+1 for mystery)\\n\\n\r\nPacing: 1/3\\n\r\nThe anime was very engaging from the beginning of the story until somewhere at the halfway point when we got to the supporting cast of witches. From then on, it seemed liked the anime was really progressing way too fast and the final arc was simply a haphazard mess with a rather anti-climactic and unsatisfactory ending. Although the resolution was good, how the anime got there felt like it was just cheating its way out of it.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also earns 1 bonus point for having no filler episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, I thought that this anime had a very interesting premise and honestly could have gone very far if it weren\u2019t for the very horrible final arc which raised too many questions and provided too little answers and left many viewers lost as to what was actually happening and why. Still, I felt that much of the anime remained enjoyable simply because of the many interactions and hilarious scenes that the characters had in each other, and it became immediately apparent that the strength of this anime lay in their diverse and impactful characters rather than the plot itself.\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to drop me a PM or leave a profile comment to let me know if you agree/disagree and why, and as always, thank you for reading through this so patiently.",

The Opening Song was amazing, it had good vibe and it makes you listen to it every time even is sites like YouTube. However, some of the OST didn't really match the anime but most did. The Ending song however wassatisfaction. This anime is also filled with comedy that will make euphoric.

            "content": "If you are remotely interested in the premise of this show, and have yet to read the manga, I beg you, READ THE MANGA FIRST. Reading the Manga before or after watching an anime usually doesn't bother me, but trust me on this one. This adaptation has a really big problem, and it will affect how you enjoy Yamada-kun and the 7 Witches.\r\nThe main problem? Pacing. This anime has a really bad pacing issue, maybe even one of the worst. The story arc that the anime is trying to adapt spans over a total of 90 chapters. Yes, nine-zero. Let me remind you that thisis a 1-cour anime, meaning it only has 12 episodes. And in that 12 episodes they have to cram the development of the 7 witches, numerous side characters, and surprising plot twists. It looks like the studio tried its best to adapt it to its fullest, but accomplishing a feat like that may be borderline impossible.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention, Yamada-kun is a complicated enough story as it is. Cramming it into 12 episodes not only emphasizes its weaknesses, but develops new ones as well, like rushed developments and exposition dialogue. Giving it 2-cour may very well solve its issues, but the fact of the matter is they tried to cram a story as convoluted as Yamada-kun into 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nBut does that mean you should avoid this show like the plague? Hell no! This anime is actually insanely fun when you get into the crux of it. The characters are all lively and hilarious. The interactions with the kisses is pretty cool, and can make you giddy from time to time. Though the music is not particularly outstanding, the OP, 'Kuchizuke Diamond', has to be one of my personal favorite OP's in anime. Every time I hear it I just have to drum my lap and tap my foot to the beat.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this show has to be one of the best demonstrations of just how talented Japanese VA's are. The show plays around body-switching, and the results produced when our MC and Lead Girl (both polar opposite personalities) are outstanding. How the VA's capture the personality of the person they switch it shows immense talent and mastery. I have to give special kudos to Hayami Saori as well, a VA that I've been fond of because of her recurring roles as an archetypal kuudere, one of my favorite tropes. This anime showcases that she actually has great vocal range, playing the vulgar MC easily. This is the show that made me put her into one of my all time favorite VA's.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want the full Yamada-kun experience, please do read the manga instead. The story and character relationships are touched upon better there, and the pacing is a lot better. It's actually pretty good; you will not regret the time used while reading it.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you have already read the manga and loved it like me, by all means do not let this pass. There is enough here to make you overlook its pacing issues, and by the end you will find this a satisfying adaptation of the manga.",

            "content": "For my anime reviews I am going to review the anime on the order of which you would experience while watching an episode of the anime that is being reviewed.\r\n1.Art - Well, for the art in this anime I couldn't say that there was any unique flare to it but it had it's good points.  Although the art wasn't unique the show was really high-res and there were some animated moments that were stunning!  For example, in the last episode there was a sunset that was just gorgeous, and if that counts as a spoiler then I'm gonna go ape shit crazy onthis place >:( .  Anyway, what I am saying is that though the art wasn't unique it deserves some credit for resolution and good animation and for that I give it an 8.\\n\\n\r\n2.Sound -   I loved the intro when I first heard it, it is just so awesome!  Other than that I never really felt like the soundtrack did anything special.  It interacted with what was happening in the story well but it felt like it was just, \"almost there\" in a sense.  I wasn't supper satisfied with the soundtrack but it was still good so i'll give it a 7.\\n\\n\r\n3.Character - One this anime did well was the romantic interaction between the main characters.  I often found myself getting hype when there was a romantic scene.  On the other hand, the characters never got a really good back story.  Sure, they did get a back story but it never really satisfied my taste and it left me feeling kinda like it was lacking a little.  The characters were not bad but they never were very likable to me.  I give a 7 for character.\\n\\n\r\n4.Story - This is the part of the review where I can say something good about this anime!  The story was a pretty good story, definitely not the best but very good.  The romance was spot on and I enjoyed that aspect of the story very much.  The other side of the story was also very good and I felt I was often drawn in to the main plot.  The story never left me in the dust but on the other hand, I still had to guess what the next plot twist was going to be so for this, I give the story an 8.\\n\\n\r\n5.Enjoyment - When I thought about reviewing this anime I just felt frustrated and it is NOT because it's a bad anime.  I felt this way because it is hard for me to explain how I feel about it.  It was good but it was not the really good.  It was \"almost there\" and that is how I feel about this anime.  It's like you were trying to do 30 jumping jacks but you only managed to do 29; UUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHH!  This anime was good but it could have been so much better and because of that, I felt a sense of emptiness after I finished this show, and because of that I only give it a 8 for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is an overall 7.\\n\\n\r\n*I would recommend this anime to a person of any age.",

            "content": "My \"Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo \" review.\r\nPS: I haven't read the manga yet.\r\nStory: My Verdict, a Very Good 8.\r\nArt:  My Verdict, a Good 7.\r\nSound:  My Verdict, a Fair 6.\r\nCharacter:  My Verdict, a Good 7.\r\nEnjoyment:  My Verdict, a Good 7\r\nOverall:  My Verdict, a  Poor 3.\r\nBlaaaaaah! That's me being disgusted of the MC guy kissing a guy, GAAAAAAY! Awwwwww, and this is me were me likey see MC guy kissing girls, so what we have is an anime/ manga or Novel were it has a gender bender/Yaoi/ Yuri element in it, but then again in it's overall theme it morelike a bisexual thingy were it involves magic , romance, comedy and some action and it involves the misadventures of the MC guy where it started him meeting witch number 1   Shiraishi Urara, and from there it goes to romance,, his meeting with the Supernatural studies club and Student Council President wannabe Toranosuke Miyamura is were the yaoi thingy starts....ok so in some aspects the MC guy is actually kissing a girl inside a boy's body, but it still disgust me out that it still makes me wanna puke, anyways with such unique plot , the part where the MC guy's task to find the 7 witches was an adventure on itself and plus the fact stick to just one of them was a real climax. Usually I avoid any animes or mangas with a yaoi thingy, this was the only one were I make an exception. So basically the story (up) itself is indeed very good. On the art category (up) I just gave it a \"Good\" for the fanservice and that's that. Sound(up) well Ryuu Yamada's voice has a bit of a mature tone in it, I guess his VA's doesn't have what it takes to do a delinquent's voice,  Shiraishi's voice if she is  Shiraishi, does have a cute tone , but in a masculine tone she sounded like a MILF.  Odagiri's VA Eri Kitamura no longer have the youthful tone and  so as Leona Miyamura's VA Miyuki Sawashiro, but then again the sound category it still \"Fair\" enough for me. On the character category(up), ok so the MC guy is a campus bad boy, but then again I like the way that he was portrayed as a double standard where at one point he's very aggressive but soft hearten, the comic aspect about him  was that he can be horny at one point, but is a pussy when seeing a girl's pussy, frankly he more like a reverse Snow White, let's not forget that this anime's title is \"Yamada and the 7 witches\" in it's English, in fact nearly every character's in this anime are seemly based on a classic fairy tale 'Snow white and the Seven  Dwarfs, so lets go over some of them:\\n\\n\r\nYamada Ryuu- Like I've said he's a reverse version of \"Snow White\" and unlike the classic fairy tale , we don't see him eat an apple and goes to sleep.\\n\\n\r\nThe 7 witches:\\n\\n\r\n Shiraishi Urara - is this anime/manga's version of Dopey, remember in the classic fairy tale, Dopey is the closes to Snow White and just like the said character, she's very much receptive of the MC Guy.\\n\\n\r\nOdagiri Nene- is this anime/manga's version of  Grumpy, and it's obvious that like Grumpy she too is always in a bad mood and a typical quintessential tsundere.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMaria Sarushima- like Doc from the classic fairy tale, she to mixes up her words, but unlike the Doc, she on the other hand supplements it wit a couple of English words.\\n\\n\r\n Noa Takigawa- she is like Sleepy from the classic fairy tale, but pretty much different, since in the anime/ manga she more of a reluctant type who wants to get rid of the witches power that retaining it.\\n\\n\r\nMeiko Ootsuka- well pretty much she does share some characteristic with Bashful from the classic fairy tale, since they both shy and don't speak a lot.\\n\\n\r\nMikoto Asuka-  well in this anime she can qualify as Sleepy from the classic fairy-tale, but I can't say the same in the manga, since there are indications that she speaks.\\n\\n\r\nRika Saionji-  I don't know if she can qualify as  Sneezy, but then again just like in the classic fairy tale they both have something extraordinary.\\n\\n\r\nOthers: \\n\\n\r\nLeona Miyamura- she is more like the magic mirror.\\n\\n\r\nToranosuke Miyamura- he is the Prince (Gay) Charming, eeeewwww.\\n\\n\r\nMiyabi Itou and Kentarou Tsubaki_- I suppose that they're the Humtsman.\\n\\n\r\nHaruma Yamazaki and Shinichi Tamaki- Well I'm guessing that they're this anime's evil witch.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I guess with such character's being pattern after the classic fairy tale, I guess it's all good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(up), well aside from the trouble that the MC guy's getting into trouble with the witches were it was funny, there is also the fanservice that I like and it's all good. But in it's overall, it really wasn't original, when such concept was copied from the classic fairly tale with a twist, also the term witches was more of an overused terminology were it doesn't really comply with character's portrayal since their magical abilities were too limited, it was kinda odd that author  Yoshikawa, Miki has to exaggerated something that was too limited with the character's portrayals, the title itself was seemly a patsy , the author should have title his creation as \"The 7 Troublesome Magic Users of Yamada\" or \"The 7 Magical Gurls of Yamada.\"  so I'm really gonna give this anime a 3. PEACE. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Initially, I thought Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo would be really cute. And that was about it. I went in with no expectations for a deep storyline or extremely compelling characters. I simply thought it would be cute and fluffy and I was looking for something light, but I started this with caution. And then, due to my lack of expectation, the show greatly surprised me and thoroughly impressed me.\r\nCharacter: 9\r\nI'm starting with character because this was definitely a place where the anime excelled. Yamada starts out as a scary, delinquent who no one, including himself, believes he belongs at the school. But he, alongwith all of the witches, make clear strides in character development from start to finish. Yamada learns compassion, the importance of true friendship and empathy as he helps each of the witches along their journey. \\n\\n\r\nShiriashi, who's a bookworm, barely participates and barely does anything besides study in the beginning, truly blossoms before our eyes. And it's mainly thanks to Yamada. It started with him and then it changed her everyday school life forever. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's how it was for all the witches. He came in and made them happier. He helped change them all for the better and because of the situation they all made friends, real friends.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe story idea was cute: a delinquent who slowly makes friends and is accepted into this group because he's the one person who can bring them all together. And along the way he helps all of them see how they can survive without their power and empathizes with each of them. \\n\\n\r\nAlso the student council president having so much power and knowledge of the entire situation was a good touch. It helped keep the story line to a more realistic path rather than being /just/ a cute story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nDefinitely good. I wouldn't say it blew me away, but it was just good. I really enjoyed the art in the opening sequence especially.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nAgain, it was good. The opening and closing songs continued the cute feel to the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThe show was very enjoyable. The character development was well thought out around the plot and the character dynamic was, at many times, comedic, but still realistic. The show wasn't entirely over the top at any given point. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 9 and one day I'll probably watch it again.",

            "content": "STORY: Ryu Yamada is your average student. A rough and intimidating delinquent on the outside, but on the inside, he\u2019s a huge softy. Bored with school, and his life, from what the anime makes out, he has a sudden turn of events when he crashes into, Urara Shiraishi, the top student of the entire school. Falling unconscious during their crash incident, Yamada wakes up in the nurse\u2019s office, later realizing he has switched bodies with Shiraishi. After countless tries to return to each other\u2019s original bodies, other classmates, Miyabi Ito and Toranouske Miyamura, catch on to what has happened between Shiraishi and Yamada. Which laterthey involve Yamada and Shiraishi in the rebirth of the Supernatural club at their school. Yamada and company realize that he has powers transferable through a kiss. \\n\\n\r\nClich\u00e9? Or, a new type of romatic-school-comedy?  You be the judge on that. \\n\\n\r\nThe club encounters other students with powers similar to Yamada and Shiraishi and then the Supernatural club takes a turn and becomes a club to hunt down the other students with supernatural powers, formally known as, witches. As the school year and their hunt continues, new students and witches make brief appearances to join them in their quest.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION: The animation was brilliant. So far 2015 for anime\u2019s animation and sounds have been up to their best potential. I truly enjoyed watching it. Everything was well drawn, the scenery was tasteful and the music brought ease and rage into my mood when watching this. All in all, this was good for sore eyes and deaf ears. The ending song leaves you stuck with a catchy tune, that you\u2019ll even find yourself humming in the shower. Something you\u2019ll grow to love and wish there were more anime with a high caliber as this. In terms of animation and sound, of course\\n\\n\r\nCatchy music and sounds, with a nice crisp pen to paper to bring finesse and fluidity to an anime, what more can you ask for? Seriously? \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: This is where this anime starts taking its toll on me, while the cast extends much more than your average anime, 7+ main and supporting characters. Their roles were butchered and taken out of the oven way TOO fast. The witches\u2019 spotlight and backstories were bland and tasteless. Their character development lacked detail and consistency. Even Yamada\u2019s development through the story got generic to the point where you\u2019re asking yourself, \u201cwhy am I still watching this\u201d? I appreciate one thing, and that\u2019s, his lack of being shy and an oblivious mess. But, confidence and assertiveness only takes you so far. While the chemistry between Yamada and Shiraishi was more thank believably natural, I still can\u2019t get myself to enjoy their subliminal love for each other. \\n\\n\r\nCONS: There had to be more. Maybe it\u2019s the time restraint this anime had. 12 episodes, they\u2019re starting to become less efficient, either that or these publishers and authors are really looking forward to making a quick buck, so they forcefed this to us thinking we would indulge in such nonsense and laziness. So, yes, if you haven\u2019t caught on, the rushed events between Yamada and each witch was poor and discouraging, the rushed and forced relationship between yamada and the witches seemed like a last minute add on. Their backstories had no consistency. I know a lot of people that read the manga, I am not included in this statistic, but I have been told that the manga is one million times better.  So much was cut out, not just comedy but little bits of development that would make character relationships feel like they had a connection.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL/ENJOYMENT: With everything stated, it seems more of a rant than an actual review, but that\u2019s usually what happens in anime adaptions. Unfortunately, not all 12 episode anime will get the justice they deserve. I enjoyed this to a certain extent. Up to episode 5, until each new witch had their backstories ruined and the character developments and connections shot. I would recommend this anime to those that have nothing else to watch, more for casual days. I would also recommend reading the manga over this, which I will later begin myself. So much potential ruined by unorganized and rushed plans. \\n\\n\r\nVERDICT: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCHECK OUT THE YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR THE SAME REVIEW, BUT IN VIDEO FORM. \\n\\n\r\nyoutube.com/projektbaka\\n",

            "content": "I saw this harem anime get a 7. something and I couldn't stand it, this harem was by far one of the most enjoyable harems I have ever seen and I'm sick as hell right now so I'll keep it quick.\r\nSee the problem with most generic harems is that there ends up being this dude who ends up being liked by the usual anime girl troupes; tsundere kuudere yandere dere this dere that. No style no creativity, just, cut and paste. Not to mention some of those harems they even ended up liking him for NO reason. \r\nThe cool part about yamada-kun and the sevenwitches is that Yamada (the heroine) isn't a dunce, in fact he's the one who thinks \"is it possible shes doing it cus she likes me?\" It also has interesting characters, their \"witch powers\" come from their \"deep desires.\" So it gives you interesting plot and character development throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also doesn't get stale, as for 1. The characters are actually interesting and unique (they have a reason they act a certain way)\\n\r\n2. It's a fast paced show (this could be good or bad but most 99% of the time it's good especially in this case)\\n\r\n3. The plot itself is unique (given the witch powers makes for some hilarious scenes) but there are some plot holes\\n\r\n4. The show itself is hilarious\\n\r\n5. There is a sincerely interesting and sort of \"OH NO!!!\" Plot twist along the show, deviating it from the stale linear pattern that some shows have. \\n\\n\r\nSo there you go, there are the major differences between Yamada-kun and the seven witches, and most harems. Sure it won't leave you breath taken and thinking for days on end but it left you enjoyed cus it never gets stale, the humor is legitimately enjoyable, it's unique (both the plot/story and the characters), and it gives you enough complexity to let you enjoy it but still be the casual harem that it is.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an earnestly enjoyable show and sets itself on a higher pedestal than most other harems, this should be ranked highly in that regard and with my final review being 8.3 (they dont give you the point options on MAL). \\n\\n",

            "content": "I dislike harem anime. \r\nTo me they're just a genre that was made for fan-service and stuff. Harem anime likes to drag its own story to the point that it's super boring to watch. I don't watch anime for its fan-service and see cute girls doing cute things. I watch anime for its story.\r\nThat's why Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo surprised me. A friend of mine recommended this anime to me and when I look it up, I saw 'harem' as one of its genre. But my friend who is a lot like me when it comes to our standard of anime likes this, sowhy shouldn't I give it a try?\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nThe story is unusual--nothing like I've ever seen before. Magic powers that only activate through kissing? Wow. In the first episode, I found myself getting attached to this anime immediately. This anime tells its story with funny jokes that is not unnecessary nor it's annoying, that made me forgot that I was actually watching a harem anime. \\n\r\nLater, this anime proved to me that it's more than just kissing anime. In fact, it's smart enough to make viewers like me to just think the kissing as something normal in Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo's universe--rather than something that's just there so the MC can have the excuse to kiss girls as many as he likes.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nI love the bright colors in this anime and other than that, there's nothing 'wow'.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nBoth the opening and the ending are very catchy. I really love the opening--it shows both protagonists' relationship and such. About the ending, maybe I jut have a soft spot towards the girl protagonist so seeing an ending which shows how she goes from a loner to a girl who has friends is really heart-warming, at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nNow, this is what I want to share with you guys. I've stated that I dislike harem anime and because of the MC never knows his *pardon my language* shit. He just blushes and such whenever a girl who likes him flirts with him, saying nice stuff to girls that makes them fall to him. And so on, you know what I mean.\\n\r\nIn Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo, the MC, Yamada, knows his shit. He wants to help. He wants to clear up the mess in his school, he knows the girl he wants. He also not the perfect boy. He's lazy, he's perverted, he loves to sleep, he doesn't have that many friends, but he has his own pros that make us see him as someone not just an anime character.\\n\r\nShiraishi, the main romance interest in this anime, actually does something too. Usually whenever there's a girl who's quiet, shy, smart, the typical perfect girl, she does nothing. The purpose for her is just so that the MC can help her somehow. But that doesn't apply to Shiraishi. She doesn't sit around sulking. She knows she loves to study and that's what she's going to do no matter the circumstances. Also, she stood up for others to Yamada at some point. This girl has a reason why she's worthy to be kept in this anime.\\n\r\nDo you guys realize, that in harem anime, the MC has other guys friend to be his sidekick? This sidekick normally is not as good looking as the MC and the purpose for him is to be the comedic relief, and to make the MC look somehow perfect. Well, in Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo, there is no significant differences between Yamada and the other guys. Yamada doesn't look like Prince Ferdinand from Snow white and the other guys doesn't represent the seven dwarfs. The guys have their own storylines and we actually care about them.\\n\r\nLast but not least, the other girls. The girls don't swoon over Yamada for some clich\u00e9 reason (because Yamada is good, Yamada tells some wise words that is not possible for a high-schooler--trust me, I'm a high school student myself). The girls have their own reasons about why they have those powers and some even have a romantic storyline.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nAn anime with a unique storyline, with a good art and sound, and definitely remarkable characters. Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo is perfect for you guys who's looking for a high-school romcom with some twists in it.\\n\r\nGive it a go!\\n\r\nPs. Sorry for grammar mistakes.",

            "content": "this review is solely based on my own experience from watching this anime. i'll start from the OP song. The OP song is extremely sweet and matches well with the anime, especially the OP video. I binged watched this whole season so i skipped the OP many times but after i was done with the whole anime, i found the song on youtube and started listening to it on repeat, and still do :-) the anime starts off immediately with the plot and basically pulls you by the arm into its own world. do NOT be put off by the quality and art style ofYamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo. The art does not do the plot and storyline justice imho. Characters are VERY well developed and you get to understand most of the characters and their emotions well. As i have said earlier, i binged watched this whole season and i hardly binge watch unless its extremely entertaining so thats that. Overall i would say if you are searching for an anime with some comedy, romance, witchcraft/magical powers that make each character special, i would 10/10 recommend this anime. Mostly for the romance as you really see how much every character's relationships blossom by the end of the season. This is my first review as i could NOT stand the low ratings on such a good anime.",

            "content": "\"Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo\", or \"Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches\"\r\nTHIS REVIEW WILL BE KIND OF LONG BUT PLEASE READ THIS AND BEAR WITH ME!\r\n      At first glance I thought this anime was going to be your normal school romance, with some magic added for some plot convenience, but oh my was I terribly wrong.I have not limited myself and enjoy the moments and episodes since \"Familiar of Zero\" And \"Your Name\", and I must say this anime was beautifully executed, with thesuspense and drama added in it really breaks my heart to let this series end.So lets get to the basics\\n\\n\r\n (Story) 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story at first as I said is a generic plot made romance \"harem\" but as the story goes on there are a lot of drama and plot twist added that even I couldn't find out after my long experience with Romance anime.And even so it had a satisfactory ending to each of the problems and this time the MC actually goes out with the girl that everyone actually wants him to be with rather than one part of the fandom going against each other.\\n\\n\r\n  (Art) 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNormally I wouldn't expect much from animation and art style for this type of anime escpecially fo romance as I have seen most romcom anime just slack off for themselves and rely and story to tell which is a good thing, but when both art and story combine, it is a beautiful sight to behold,much like \"Your Name\" the art styles and animation are just as beautiful as all the other aspects of it.I was very surprised with the opening and the ending songs as I never really watch through them and skip them, especially for the romance section of anime,but this is the first time I have actually stayed to watch and enjoy both the OP and the Ending Songs for an anime.\\n\\n\r\n  (Sound) 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic is great, good actor choice, blends in with art.. Need I say more?\\n\\n\r\n  (Character) 10/10\\n\\n\r\nUnlike your normal harem, the guy is not as dense, and the antagonist actually has a proper reason to be an antagonist, and it is very easy to see the reasons to become a witch and the character development has also helped with this. Beautiful\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really loved this anime and very sad to let it go, but I hope this review helps it out a bit in your decision to watch it, if not then my ratings would go from 8-10, as my opinions dont really match up with some of you weebs (Yes I can see you) Sooo, enjoy the ride!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overall a light hearted anime that just wants you to have fun. You wont get any deep philosophical messages on how to live your life, nor will you get complex characters dealing with deep seated fears and emotions. And thats not a bad thing. \r\nA simple effective love story between the two main characters accompanied with quirky side characters make it an enjoyable watch. The humour is on point and every episode is fun and enjoyable. \r\nAll the witches look unique and most of them look awesome. The only slight drawback is that the MC is a delinquent and yet everyone around him is strongerthan him. The music is awesome. Its been a while since I have been wowed by the music. Mostly consisting of synthetic pieces with some falling under either trance/house, it gets the job done. Definite OST purchase for me. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n - The witches are awesome, each bringing their own personality quirk. \\n\r\n - A simple love story told efficiently over the course of 12 episodes without having to rely on crappy love triangles and needless drama. \\n\r\n - A good antagonist in the last few episodes. \\n\r\n - Great music overall. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nNone really. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall an 8/10. Not groundbreaking, definitely not an anime which people will talk about years from now. Does what it sets out to do, which is to tell an interesting story and make the viewers laugh. \\n",

            "content": "Its been awhile since i last watched a romance harem anime as i lost interest in them due to obvious reasons.But then i stumbled upon this anime.At first i was skeptic and went in with no expectations as i would usually be betrayed by them.Tho that changed after i watched the 1st ep.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nAs of now i dont determine an anime's worth solely on the bases of its storyline,tho obviously i wouldnt watch one with a horrible storyline,so i didnt focus much on how well the story was executed.If i had to evaluate it  i would say the supernatural elements were quite interesting aswe get a glimpse of something i have never seen before.But thats as far as it goes.Other elements were pretty generic for a harem anime as we had the mc eventually having all the girls around him falling in love with him(possibly even the boys).It was up to the mc to save them by kissing them and as such the story followed by, which anyone could have seen through.\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 10/10\\n\r\nThe character design and animation were perfectly executed in this anime.I cant standby watching an anime with 90s animation and having dull characters.In this anime, each character had their own unique hair colours and almost all of them didn't look out of place.'Almost all of them' not everyone.Their were some characters, such as that girl in class 1 who had light blue hairs, who looked pretty unusual for a highschool student and one would be wondering where they came from.Besides that, the animation was smooth and really good.\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe soundtracks weren't anything special and didn't appeal much to me tho at some points they fitted in perfectly with the atmosphere and enhanced the watching experience.\\n\r\nCharacters:8/10\\n\r\nInitially, i was on the thought that we would once again have another dense typical mc who failed at almost everything in life but this wasn't the case.Yamada, the mc, as a character was interesting and it was really enjoyable just watching him being a complete savage.He was a somewhat empathetic person who was also strong-willed in his actions.He was a straight to the point guy who also happened to be a delinquent.Some of his actions were really hilarious like that one time were he was in the body of shiraishi and was going to punch her bully but all of a sudden his real body(who was mentally shiraishi) appeared and usually the character would stop just at the last second but he went full on and literally sent his own body flying.Ofc there were other moments like these too which left me laughing.\\n\r\nShiraishi, on the other hand, was a complete opposite of yamada.She respected her teachers and was top in her studies.If i had to choose a fav character in the whole series it would probably be her.At first one might think she is a cold hearted serious character(i dont hate characters like those, hell one of my all time  fav female character is cold hearted and serious),this is true to some extent, but after she spent some time with yamada she happened to be a cute and caring person who was really kind.\\n\r\nOther then these two, miyamura,ito and odagiri were also likeable and funny character.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8/10\\n\r\nAt first i really enjoyed the anime as it surpassed my expectations for a harem anime but mid way it kinda got boring.Tho, in the end, it retained its title and the last arc was interesting.\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nTaking everything into consideration, this would be one of the few harem-romance anime which i enjoyed watching and didn't regret it afterward.But i wouldn't rec this to those who want to watch an anime with an amazing plot and want action scenes as this rarely had any fight scenes since that wasnt the main focus.",

            "content": "Story: 7\r\nArt: 7\r\nSound: 8\r\nCharacter: 8\r\nEnjoyment: 7 \r\nOverall: 7\r\nTo be honest, I came into this anime with pretty low expectations. Like you would only need to the synopsis to know that there there are other two anime/manga that shares similar concept. Two well known anime/manga, one finished publication in 2014 and the other finished in 2012.\r\nLet me just say this out right now. The series is riddled with cliches. There'll be times where you'll might be doubting yourself thinking ahead of the episode and say to yourself \"surely, that's not going to happen. Surely not\". Well, I'll tell you one thing, my friends. This anime hasa way on making doubters becomes believers. After a few episodes, I went from \"will it happen\" to \"it's going to happen\".\\n\\n\r\nTo extend upon the matter of cliches you're gonna have: a cliched MC, a cliched girl. A cliched encounter with cliched results. I mean, I could almost say that eventually at this \\n\\n\r\nBut does anything I'd said before make this a bad series? Actually no! \\n\\n\r\nI think it is because of these cliches, that drew so many people towards this anime. I mean, my film scoring studies teacher once told me that that a hook cannot exist without cliches. I know he said it in the context of film composition, but now that I think about it, this is true for anything related to artistic creativity. In fact, I will concede in saying that I wouldn't have been able to connect myself to the story if it weren't for the cliches.\\n\r\nI also enjoyed the artwork. It is the sort of style that you would expect from 2008 and onwards. Whether or not that's a bad thing, is up to you to decide. The OP is great too. I really enjoyed the song. In fact, being a music students trained in piano, I really have a soft spot for OPs that integrates the piano - and strings too. Hence why my rating for sound is disproportionately higher. Oh come on! It's a breath of fresh air; so much of the anime's OPs consists of: a couple of electric guitars, an electric bass, drums and the vocals. I mean, that's not an entirely bad thing because it's the  J-Rock standard (which became global Rock-pop standard from the 60s thanks to The Beetles, but that's neither here nor there). But it is just simply cool to use OTHER instruments? Why because they also exist.\\n\r\nHere's a fun drinking game: go through your anime list and for every series OP that uses the J-Rock standard, take a shot. \\n\\n\r\nThe series also does great in developing the characters. Over time, we see changes in the characters that progress alongside the story. These changes are of course onset by the progression of the series. I think it's great too. I also loved their personalities and how the story establishes the relationship between themselves and the MC. Also, it's not some cheesy harem too. This gets a tick in my book. Why do I think like this? That'd go under spoilers. All I can say is although relationships are established there is no line that's being crossed. Yes, for the more acute of you out there and those who reads synopsis before and anime or manga series, you will know that something more than just friendship develops between the two MCs. What sort of relationship? Well, you'll just have to find out. (to our benevolent MAL overlords: I'm not really spoiling the plot. It's not really spoilers when correlatively, you can find out that much by looking at the synopsis and knowing that it's a freaking Romance anime. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are times where the anime falls short on me giving the \"\u51c4\u3044\u201d seal of approval. These are leaning not too hard on criticism, just suggestions for changes.\\n\r\nThe first \"suggestion\" is that they explored concepts quite a few anime have failed to do and several other series chose to stay away from. All I could think was that in order to explore these concepts full and successfully, the amount of episodes for this series was not enough. Not only that, but they made the same mistake twice. \\n\r\nSecondly, this might be just subjective observation, but the story itself is not fully fleshed out enough. I mean, for those of you who've already watched this, there are quite a few character back-story. But hey, you only got twelve episodes.\\n\r\nThirdly. What's with that ending? I get that they want to maintain consistency with Yamada, but seriously, I really hadn't liked that the anime ended the way it had. I personally don't like it. After everything that the two MCs have gone through, are they really gonna end it like that? I think you're gonna have to accept it though, given the context:that everyone's in middle high. Romance in middle high can be an awkward thing. \\n\\n\r\nINTERJECTION: It has come to my attention that there is a manga for this. I didn't know! I watched the anime first way before i ever realized that I should've read the manga part first. Once I found out, I know that clearly the manga will have way more in terms of character development. That was my fault and I apologize for this.\\n\\n\r\nSo, would I recommend this anime for other people? Most definitely! Go watch this if you hadn't already and have nothing else. If you have another series that's like more than thirteen episodes long and goes really in-depth in its concepts, I think watch that first and then come and watch this anime. Unfortunately, they could only do with what they've got. Yet in spite of this, I still think it's a really good anime. After you watch the anime, I'll then encourage you to then read the manga which I'll be doing. Because it'll clear up any confusions that you may have. All because I posted this review up before reading the manga. That's why my overall rating is an \u826f\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d out of 10. It's an anime that is good, but could be better. Yet in terms of the plot, will have to resort to the manga to get everything explained to you. But still, a good anime to have in your \"Plan to watch\" list.",

The plot usually gets lost because of filler episodes but if you enjoy those type of slice of life highschool themed animes where the characters will eventually get back to the real plot, then this might be for you.\r\nAlso,I kinda recommend reading the manga.

            "content": "To be honest, i never wanted to watch this anime and i was a bit board of watching anime in general. Just thinking about watching anime at the time made my head hurt a bit. I only watched the first episode and i thought it was quite boring for an Anime with such a rare concept. To me first impressions mean a lot and i just found it to be not as funny or as romantic as i wanted it to be. After countless months of running away from this anime i finally decided to watch it and somehow i really really loved it. \r\nStory:8/10\\n\r\nI wanted to say that the story in this anime was perfect because that would have been my initial response but after watching the ending i could see little cracks and that didn't quite hold up this pillar. The good things about the story were that the concept was executed perfectly, the drama was done perfectly and that the surprise rift was a genius idea. I also liked a bunch of other things like how they did some cliche anime scenes like the visit at bathhouse, but they didn't make it seem like the average story you would get from the cliches ( They stuck with originality and still kept it in the boundary of tradition). I also like how the main plot began to develop from the beginning of the anime and that itself added 6 points to the story. The first and ONLY gripe i had with the story was the lack of romance between the Urara and Ryuu. I won't go as far as to say that i didn't enjoy those special moment they had but it was too little for me personally and it ruined the character of Urara. I don't know why but every time i see a dandere main in an anime, i tend to root for them but it never seems as though the writers are even trying to make a connection sometimes. In This anime they lack a lot romance scenes and some reviewers say that they make up for it with the memorable ones but that still doesn't hide the fact that their connection is a bit lacking. They could have easily taken advantage of the switching bodies concept and they did to an extent but not enough so that itself brought down my expectations and it took away two points from the rating. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is great, character designs were great, the colors were great, the scenes were great, EVERY SINGLE SECOND OF ART WERE A THRILL TO WATCH AND I THOSE REVIEWERS WHO GAVE IT A SEVEN CAN SUCK IT. IT IS DEFINITELY HIGHER THAN AVERAGE ART THESE DAYS.",

            "content": "When it comes to a particular anime, there is always something special you are looking for in the show that makes it stand out, the reason that you are watching this instead of something else. A setting never seen before, a story full of plot-twists, unique characters are just a few examples but I think there is something else people forget. In my opinion in order to have a great show you don\u2019t have to re-invent the wheel, instead you can break down your genre/characters to the core and focus on the good parts while avoiding most of the annoying cliches/stereotypes, thus creating a refreshingand enjoyable series.\\n\\n\r\nYamada-kun and the Seven Witches (referred to as YAT7W in the future) does exactly that and even more. If you are tired of dull characters, stories that go nowhere, distasteful fanservice, lack of kissing and/or any kind of physical interaction between characters in a romance then look no further. Should my overall score not give it away yet, let me tell you beforehand that I really love this show, but I think just because I like the series probably a bit too much doesn\u2019t make my opininon any less valid and my rating is heavily influenced by my enjoyment. However don\u2019t go into the show with very high expectations as that can ruin the entertainment completely and don\u2019t take everything I say for granted even if this may sound contradictory to my previous sentence. So if you came for the short answer then yes, you should watch YAT7W. If that wasn\u2019t convincing enough then behold the wall of text in which I explain what you can expect from one of my favourite entries of 2015.\\n\\n\r\nTo start things off, I am not going to talk about the story much, you can read the synopsis yourself, but I think the body-switching plot element deserves a special note. In the slice of life, romance, comedy genres the most important thing is the characters, their personalities, development, goals, interactions. With that said, characters being able to switch bodies adds a whole new layer of possibilities, interactions and perspectives that hasn\u2019t really been explored before and I am honestly surprised that so few shows tried this out, but hey, this makes YAT7W all the more interesting. I would also like to give credit to the voice actors, I think they did a fantastic job at capturing all the different personalities as a result of body-switching which made the immersion even more impressive.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what made me fell in love instantly with the series were the characters. They really felt like actual people and it was so refreshing and nice to see characters that don\u2019t act like frightened animals at the slighest contact with the opposite gender. On top of that every important character has depth and there is always something more to them than meets the eye even if they felt stereotypical at first glance. The female and male protagonist of the show, Shiraishi and Yamada were by far my favourite characters, they set perfect example of how to write good characters and I\u2019m sure most of us can easily relate to them throughout the series in one way or another. Their relationship outshines every other character interaction and the development of these two is what drives the story forward. But because of this, some of the side characters don\u2019t get as much screen time as they deserve and are quickly cast to the side after their initial episode, but being only a 12 episodes anime the creators had to move with the story if they wanted any kind of conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to my next point; the pacing. This show is incredibly fast, which I really liked in the beginning since I didn\u2019t have to sit through 10 minutes of internal monologues. There was always something going on and the characters weren\u2019t just fooling around. However this quickly became a problem in the later half of the series where a lot of episodes felt extremely rushed, important details weren\u2019t explained properly and a lot of things happened for the sake of plot convenience which makes me wish that this show had 24 episodes because I honestly think it deserved more than 12. This is also apparent by the length of the episodes (24-25min), which still wasn\u2019t always enough to make certain episodes perfectly understandable, there were just simply too much content (I haven\u2019t read the manga but I can clearly tell) to squeeze it into 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, it\u2019s nothing to write home about the characters designs are very well done, the backgrounds are nice as well and the movements always felt fluid.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack on the other hand definetely deserves a lot of praise. The songs during the episodes always set the perfect mood during each scene, few of them especially stood out for me and when started playing I knew things were about to go down. The ending is nice, but the real deal is the opening. Very simple visuals paired with a calm and beautiful song made for a surprisingly addictive intro which also fits the show perfectly. Hats off to the opening, pun intended.\\n\\n\r\nNot to say that the series always had pink atmosphere of course. For a mostly comedy focused show there were a lot of serious moments especially towards the end, and I was very happy to see that YAT7W managed to blend humour and drama together very well. Furthermore there were moments in the show when I thought I was watching something like Code Geass or Steins Gate with all the crazy shenanigans going on, even though this show is nowhere near as serious and not as mind-blowingly complicated as those.\\n\\n\r\nWhile a lot of people label this show as a harem, I disagree with this. It\u2019s true that Yamada is surrounded by female characters, but they aren\u2019t that close to him like in other harem shows, and instead of love, I think it\u2019s rather a healthy curiosity on the part of most of the girls, not to mention that Yamada has clearly set his mind on a specific girl, so the show feels a lot more like a romance instead of a harem.\\n\\n\r\nBefore arriving to the conclusion there are some minor points I would like to touch on: First of all the fanservice in the show is just perfect. There are always at least 2-3 scenes per episode and it\u2019s always noticable but very tame at the same time, it never gets in the way of the storytelling and isn\u2019t distracting at all. The humour is also very clever, granted there are plenty of pervy jokes here and there but come on, when thinking about switching bodies with the opposite gender what comes to your mind first? There are also a lot of funny stuff hidden in the details and if you pay attention you are in for a treat. What you won\u2019t find however is the awkward type of humour which shows like these are famous for and I was personally very grateful for this. What you will see however instead is chubby characters (!), and I think this deserves special mention since they are so rare. This also goes to show that the series is very realistic but still feels like an anime, and in my opinion this is something every show should try to achive no matter the setting. The ending of the show is also well done, the possibility of a second season is still there and I would very much like to see one, however it ended in a way that I\u2019m satisfied even if there will never be a sequel which is not something I can tell about most 12 episode long shows.\\n\\n\r\nSo as we approach the end of my review I would like to thank you for reading and for your patience, unless you just skipped here of course, then no cookies for you. I think this is as in-depth as a written review can be and I realize it\u2019s probably way too long but I feel any less wouldn\u2019t do the series justice and if I convinced you to watch the show then my job is done. Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches is a unique take on the slice of life romantic comedy genre in a way that it didn\u2019t revolutionize anything, but simply did almost everything right, while getting rid of the annoying and immersion-breaking traits that other anime can\u2019t seem to let go of. It\u2019s not perfect by any means but I enjoyed the heck out of it, and that\u2019s all that matters in the end.\\n",

Quit reading past the synopsis! that's all you need to enjoy this anime! \r\nThe story starts off at a relatively quick pace, and then gains more speed all the way to the conclusion. This twelve episode anime is perfectly packed in the most satisfying way in regard topace and closure. \\n\r\nThat means there's practically no chance for a season two, but that was such a good ending that nobody would want that anyway. ah, emotions.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was pretty meh, and I honestly don't remember what it sounded like, but the OP and ED were pretty catchy and swell. Oh yeah, both totally added to my playlist!\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation.

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\n[Mini Review]\r\nYamada is yet another school life comedy that tries to differentiate itself through a certain gimmick, in this case one of the supernatural kind that seeks to initiate amusing character interactions and forward the story, the plot only moving forward as more ideas keep churning in and shaking up the formula. Readers of the manga will tell you the narrative is extremely rushed, and I agree, characters often drop in and out of importance unritualistically, and there's not enough time to possibly develop them all as the show makes a point of introducing new characters and supernatural every episode tokeep the fun moving. But that's the nice thing about Yamada, it's 12 episodes of charming and entertaining randomness spliced with romance and hints of ecchi that is easy to digest and is gone before you know it, and that's all it needs to do, as you never need to think about it again.\\n\\n\r\nIt knows how to do its job and well, and though the job of a slice-of-life supernatural harem isn't one with many rewards in terms of deep characters or a plot that doesn't nearly completely rely on coincidences and contrivances, it still executes with contagious energy and a sense of self awareness. If you go into Yamada with the right expectations, you'll get exactly what you came for, and that's great; the show serving well as a breather in between more heavy and complex anime. It's not likely you won't find something to like: the characters have great chemistry even with the ever-growing roster, the animation is pretty and cute, and the opening song is actually quite amazing all things considered, at the very least, it's not something you'll want to skip often, even serving as a tool for emotional attachment in some cases.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's surprising is that the show actually finds its strength in the more dramatic moments as opposed to the zaniness of the everyday-life comedy. Character backstories are thought-out and effective, even if said characters usually drop out of the narrative picture once their one episode of focus is over, which nearly counter-balances what the show does well with the cast. Our two leads however: Yamada and Shiraishi, are surprisingly well developed and enduring, and if you're willing to give just a little emotional investment towards these two and the rest of the cast, the anime will pay you back in an emotionally charged finale that still remembers elation and hijinks are the real cores of this show, and never tries to stray too far from those roots and asks for the viewer to give unrealistic amounts of craps about what is happening. And don't too many craps either, because even if you're invested, don't ever forget what this show really is, because if you lose sight of that amidst the occasional drama, you're going to end up expecting what the anime can't give you: true depth and truly good writing. But despite that, Yamada is still one hell of a good time. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 5.5/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Yeah, she just wanted to kiss. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog!

            "content": "The title of spring 2015\u2019s Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches anime made me worry that this would be a harem anime. Thankfully, it is not. Instead, Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches sets about briskly extracting as much intelligence and wit out of its simple body-swapping premise as possible. \r\nProtagonist Yamada hides a good heart inside a delinquent streak bigger than his ego. Female lead Shiraishi is a quiet honor student whose good grades are a product of her shyness and isolation moreso than any kind of ambition. Student council member Miyamura is smart as a whip but cool as a cucumber, while Supernatural Club memberIto\u2019s obsession with the supernatural leads the rest of her class to shun her as a chronic liar (not to mention weirdo).\\n\\n\r\nNot only are the characters\u2019 personalities different, there\u2019s follow-through with that. Miyamura\u2019s student council connections are explored, with his motivations for enabling Yamada and Shiraishi\u2019s body swapping made an impetus for further plot movement. Ito is a weirdo who loves aliens and other New Age garbage, but Yamada uses his time in her body to help her, ultimately giving her a safe place to be her own weird self.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite moment that stems from exploring the characters\u2019 personalities happens when Shiraishi swaps bodies with Yamada to avoid a cold. After Shiraishi states that she is only a good student because she has nothing else in her life but her grades and tells Yamada leave, Yamada instead stays to give her some comfort and company. He encourages her to go to college by saying that he, in all his delinquency and outbursts, will try to go to college as well, if she will. It was really touching and gave us new insight to both of these charactrs and the slow and tender growth of their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nYamada can switch bodies with anyone, with a kiss. This premise could get played out in just one episode, but Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches has had four episodes so far and the premise remains interesting.\\n\\n\r\nFor one, the show doesn\u2019t always do the same thing with Yamada\u2019s switching. When Yamada switches with Ito, he ends up kicking the collective ass of a group of rude jerks who were bent on exploiting Ito\u2019s need for weird supernatural crap. But when Yamada switches with Shiraishi, it is just as often at her request as it is at his. She switches with him so that he can make friends for her, something the socially isolated and awkward girl doesn\u2019t know how to do. He switches with her so she can take his tests for him, not (just) so he can grope himself. (She checks out what Yamada\u2019s working with, too.)\\n\\n\r\nThe last few episodes see Yamada\u2019s body-switching power gone completely in favor of a berserk charm ability that overpowers the subject with a driving need to make Yamada theirs, an ability that appalls Yamada and leaves Ito and Miyamuri equally repulsed after he lifts it with a kiss.\\n\\n\r\nIn short: Should you watch Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches?\\n\r\nYes: It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s funny and the characters are entertaining and relatable. Yamada reminds me very fondly of Yuusuke from Yu Yu Hakusho, another loud guy with skill in a fight and a good heart. If you\u2019re in the mood for something light, this is perfect.",

I figured it was gonna be another typical Harem anime, but it quickly kills that notion as episodes go by. \r\nVoice acting 10/10\r\nThe voice acting for the anime is superb.

            "content": "~Story~ 7.5 \r\nI think the story itself is the only shortcoming to this anime really. I mean if you really take a second to think about it, seven witches in a high school, okay sounds cool no biggie, but wait they can only use their powers by kissing someone? Okay now hold the bus... There is a club called the supernatural studies club and it starts investigating these seven witches, and their mission is to find all of them. How did this start? because yamada got jealous and annoyed by the honors student shirashi. Now shirashi has the power of body swapping. not that bigof a deal in the long run but in the beginning? oh dear. even though Yamada seems to be mostly respectful of shirashi's body, she does not help matters by saying he can wash her body for her while they do a body swap like really. But anyways even though there is obvious perverted potential Yamada kun and the seven witches is probably one of the most entertaining short anime's I've seen so far. \\n\r\n~Art~ 8 \\n\r\nThe animation is fluent, I haven't found to many errors with it, and the characters themselves look beautiful and desirable. You can tell what each character is supposed to be feeling just by looking at their faces. \\n\r\n~Sound~ 7.5 \\n\r\nOpening song: 8 \\n\r\nThis song is extremely upbeat and catchy, plus it\u2019s a perfect fit for this anime. I could help but find myself singing along with my hands tapping out the beat \\n\r\nEnding song: 6 \\n\r\nIt\u2019s a cute song and its sounds wonderful but it does not fit well with the anime in my mind. It's not very catchy \\n\r\nVoice acting: 8 \\n\r\nThe voice acting was very well done. Everyone fit with their character and it was funny to listen to how they changed their voice compared to who was in their body and what the situation called for. \\n\r\n~Character~ 8 \\n\r\nCharacter development is something that tends to get left behind in most short anime's but this anime was different. Even though it was short there was most definitely development among all the characters. Yamada-kun who the story follows changes a lot through the twelve episodes mostly because of Shiraishi and the new friends he has made. But in all cases the seven witches and the mortals who are part of the supernatural studies club all have changes in their personality once they meet Yamada-kun. \\n\r\n~Enjoyment~ 9 \\n\r\nI want to say that I'm rating my enjoyment a little high but alas I can't. This anime was funny and sweet and even thought the way for the witches to use their powers was a little strange I enjoyed the different powers that were displayed and the effects they had on the characters. Even the relationships themselves were interesting and at times hilarious \\n\r\n~Overall~ 8.8 \\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime for its laughs, its magical difference and just because it's interesting to watch.",

            "content": "I never really expected any anime to be THIS good.\r\nAs a self-proclaimed otaku, I've had a lot of trouble rating all the anime I've seen (62 according to this site, though that includes sequels) and I'm sure I'm not alone when saying that I've had a lot of trouble rating all the anime I've seen. I mostly just rate them on \"good\" or \"decent\" or \"meh\". However, this one is now easily my favorite anime of all time. First off, the MC is a very good break from the classic, goody two-shoes gentlemen who all the women throw themselves at him from day 1. Infact, he's quite the opposite. He's a delinquent, who basically everyone stays away from. Good change of pace.\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated, not all the girls are throwing themselves at him. Sure, it is a harem anime, so a small amount of stuff with most of the girls is to be expected, but not like \"OMG I LUV U LETS HAV SEX XOXO\". It seems like most of the relationships stay pretty basic, as friend or upper class man.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very nice, from bigger scenes to smaller details (for instance a small line of saliva after a kiss). The music is on its own level entirely, I could write many sentences on the opening alone.\\n\\n\r\nSo I will. (Feel free to skip this part if you don't care much about the opening song)\\n\\n\r\nThe intro is soft from the piano and I think violin? However it gets more fast paced about half way through the intro, but not TOO fast like a rock song, but it can still work in the drums in for a beat very nicely. The voice singing sounds very calming, but not enough to put you to sleep, especially with the beat that isn't too slow, and isn't too fast. The animation that goes with it is very nice as well, with a slightly lighter tint, and showing basically just the main characters, with witch floppy hats (though the anime is notably missing any floppy witch hats).\\n\\n\r\nBack to the main review.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is very nice as well, and they all have a main characteristic with them, that kinda defines them. For example, there's the pervert, the bookworm, and the liar (or as I prefer to call her, the conspiracy theorist), to try and not give away to much about them. Other than those main ones, the others do have things about them, but that's a bit more spoiler like, and I'm writing this assuming that this is the first you are reading of this anime, so I won't go into that.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that isn't really a complaint, just something to note, is that while the anime is tagged with \"Ecchi\", the anime shouldn't really be categorized as such. The most that's really shown are a few bra and pantie shots and one spa scene, but that's about it. There is a lot of kissing, but, its just kissing. I've watched even a NON ECCHI that showed more (Mirai Nikki, very good anime if you haven't seen it), but as someone who isn't off fapping to anime in my bed to ecchi's, I'm completely fine with that.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a wonderful anime, and I highly recommend you check it out!",

That premise was that Yamada switched bodies with a girl Urara Shiraishi. This, in itself, could have been a very interesting and comedic narrative. Actually, scratch that, it would have been the best romantic comedy ever.\r\nUnfortunately the narrative gets bogged down by introducing 6 other \"witches\" and an almighty student council. So it just becomes a paranormal investigation to hunt down and find the other witches.\r\nI feel like there was a missed opportunity here. Cramming all of this into 12episodes was also a hatchet job. There were way too many characters for this to even work. At least for the first couple episodes it works.",

Lots of kissing, tits, boy love, yaada. Don't take this the wrong way -- this anime was really fun to watch.\r\nYamada-kun is a really bad kid who's been doing whatever he wants around school, until one day he falls down the stairs and crashes against his female classmate, accidentally kissing her and switching bodies. The two find out about their abilities, then students who suspect them join thegroup and together they start the Supernatural club. That's when they find out that there are a number of witches around school with different abilities, and... well, yeah. That's about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire anime is actually portrayed as one giant filler. Each episode jumps from one to another in a fast paced, leaving you wondering whether or not you may have skipped an episodes since the last one you saw -- and each episode, for the most part, deals with a certain witch and finding out about her powers. Yamada also admits to his own feelings, not hiding that he has fallen in love.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime really picks up at around the eighth episode, where Yamada's behavior actually have consequences on the people around him, and the witches' power come in and play a larger role. It even gets emotional, and actually becomes well thought-out further than I expected. The ending is satisfying and provides with great closure and resolution.\\n\\n\r\nGood anime, funny and makes for a nice watch. Gets good at episode 8 and overall leaves a really good impression and taste. Would recommend to anyone who's in for something relaxing to watch.",

The minute I saw those videos, I clicked away from the anime. I disliked watching ecchi, since, almost all ecchi anime have dumb protagonists, weird plot-holes and a bunch of stupid shit that makes no sense. And to me, after watching those videos, I felt entirely the same.\r\nCut to a few months later (according to the anime's release, an year later) Igot annoyed of people talking such good stuff about it, that I decided to watch it myself, despite knowing that it was (going to be) completely horrible. \\n\\n\r\nBut, instead of finding myself annoyed, I found an extremely pleasant surprise. What this anime does best, is give itself interesting characters, and a captivating story line. Yes, the anime has ecchi, but not stupid characters. In fact, I believe, I liked all the characters introduced. Even the supposing \\n\r\n'love rival'. But, I think a character everyone liked while watching watching this anime was shiraishi.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not one to give spoilers in anime, but unlike in other harems, the MC had a love interest, and this anime even tackled the problems faced in real-life relationships.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I think this was an excellent anime, give the manga a read and this a watch, you definitely won't be disappointed.",

Not only because of the good story , but also with the comedy it brings. It's opening is super catchy , (not to mention I always sing it when taking a potty break and while drawing...)back to the review. \r\nAlso the one I loved most is SHIRAISHI! The story would be dull without her and Yamada anyway. And also I love the voice acting , fits their characters greatly. Plus I loved Yamada's attitude , he always does his best for others. Notmany MCs in Animes do that. If not with the Witch Powers it would be most likely like Oregairu well... Both MCs have the same attitude and both female MCs have One Genius and a Energetic Girl. (Shiraishi - Ito) (Yukino - Yuigahama) But I only rated it 9/10 because they put up a  cliffhanger in the end. I wish they would put up a 2nd season so we could see the new witches.\\n\\n\r\nOkay so this is my 1st review I hope you liked it.",

            "content": "Most of us have probably at some point wished for certain powers, be it telepathy or body switching. This show has it all, tightly wrapped up in a neat little bow called a \"harem\".\r\nI don't know about you, but I for one rarely cut the harem genre any slack at all. Even though I can understand why people like it, I personally don't find any appeal in watching a show of that kind. With that said, \"Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo\", henceforth refered to as simply Yamada-kun, is from my experience a bit unique in that it actually uses the concept of a harem insuch a manner that it works for me.\\n\\n\r\nIn the following review I will attempt to convince you to not only give this anime a chance, even if you're a complete oppositionist of the genre as a whole, but also to see it in a different light than you did before.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, enough blabbering, onto the actual contents of the show:\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, Yamada-kun manages to present the harem elements in such a fashion that makes at least a tiny bit of sense. You get that the show would not work without them, and it doesn't try to implement them simply as a means to create silly moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of the show is that the main character, Yamada, obtains the powers of any witch that he kisses. One switches bodies with him, another gives him the power to converse telepathicly with anyone.\\n\\n\r\nWhat drives the story forward is the characters quest to find all the witches, which proves to be easier said than done. The first half of the show feels very much like a simple slice of life, which I prefered over the forced plot in the second half. When they reached the second half of the show the main plotline was slowly revealed over the following episodes, and the execution of that was quite well put together, but the plot that was shown did nothing to catch your interest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story was not that compelling, but it was presented in an impressive way, which made it a lot more entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nAlthough the art style was very simplistic, it looked pretty decent. It was not really amazing in any way, but it was enough and fit the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation on the other hand, was pretty impressive at some points. It never felt like they ran out of budget, and most of the scenes that were supposed to impress, actually did.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason that the art score is not higher is because a lot of time was used for just sitting around and talking. That's completely fine, but it limits the amount of realism in the scene when everyone else in the background is just sitting around and not moving for a couple of minutes.\\n\\n\r\nMost backgrounds were pretty bland, but some moments put more detail into the setting around the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe OST is decent, some tracks stood out more than others, but overall it's nothing special. They were well used, and fit the mood in every scene they were used, though.\\n\\n\r\nI usually don't notice any significant changes in the Japanese voice acting due to the fact that I don't speak the language (apart from the REALLY good or bad scenes in certain shows). In this show however there was a twist that made me appreciate the voice actors a lot more. The ability to switch bodies. Due to the existance of this particular ability, the voices of the characters always stayed the same, but due to someone else inhabiting their bodies at the time, they obtained others personalities, which was very well done. You could really feel that they had swapped places.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED was okay, it did it's job of telling you that the episode was over and that it's time to calm down, think about what you just saw, and just enjoy the music playing. Also worth mentioning is the fact that the animation during the ending theme was quite pretty and showed us more of the main female.\\n\\n\r\nThe main thing that made me watch the show was actually the OP, which is just so catchy. It really caught my attention in some \"Top Opening\" list, and I've listened to it way more times than I thought I would. The animation here is perfectly timed with the music as well, which makes it worth watching on top of listening to the good song.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThe fact that most of the characters in the show were either witches or, like Yamada himself, witch slayers, they all played at least a semi-important part in the story. This made me appreciate the appearance of every character a whole lot more.\\n\\n\r\nNo characters felt simply like plot devices, but they didn't really feel realistic either. Most of the witches were only archetypes with a singular or a few unique characteristics. It a show like this that isn't really a big deal, but it is worth pointing out, and it makes the characters feel less like actual people.\\n\\n\r\nYamada felt most like an actual person, but that'sv mostly because we see the show from his perspective, which gives us more room to find out about his personality. He felt pretty generic for a main character, but he was certainly more entertaining to watch than other harem protagonists I've seen. He even noticed that some of the girls liked him later on, which is rare for people in his position when it comes to anime.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI really did enjoy Yamada-kun a whole lot more than I thought I would, and I do recommend it to anyone who can tolerate some very \"typical anime\" elements, like the high school setting, etc.\\n\\n\r\nEven though it's a harem it really feels more like a typical slice of life show with some supernatural stuff. The romance also leads somewhere, which is rare for harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nIndividual scores for each category can be found by clicking on the \"Overall Score\" button in the top-right corner of the review.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the show a numerical score of 6. It was entertaining, but not ground-breaking in any way really. Most of my enjoyment came from me expecting more harem tropes and that not being the case, so take my recommendation with a grain of salt.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my review! If found it helpful, or not, please take your time to both rate it accordingly and tell me what you thought I did right/wrong so I can improve until my next review.",

            "content": "Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches\r\nThe art in this show is stellar. While it is pretty generic in a few character faces, each one feels unique and the story telling gives them each a great personality. Being able to have the bright and wonderful colors to differentiate between some of the characters, without it being over-the-top, really made it easy to keep the \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d straight in my mind. While I did notice a similar face here and there, they are each drawn with a uniqueness to them, that as the story progressed, one could know what was happening. I really enjoyed just looking at thisshow. While the characters are all pleasing and cute, the colors were never overly saturated or overly bright, but overall warm. While the fan-service is at a minimum, there is a bath scene or two and a main plot line of kissing, both man on man, woman on man, and woman on woman at times, but i\u2019ll talk more about that in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is something that, during the show, really helps to push the plot forward. There are scenes that the emotion is so rich and so important, and I truly feel that the music is what brings those scenes together. What is so important about the music is that it is part of the unexpected as well as the plot is. The music in the opening and closing however, while cute and catchy isn\u2019t something I found myself watching often. I could hum along but I would just be waiting for the kiss at the end. As for other sounds, they felt pretty generic, door slamming, or punches to the face, there wasn\u2019t much of a specific sound, but these things happen so quickly that one might not even notice if not looking out for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, and what a story it is. I have to say there were times when I got so worked up that I had to yell out because something happened and I couldn\u2019t hold my emotions in. This is a story about a delinquent student, Yamada, who after a turn of events falls into a girl who spends most of her time in solitude, Shiraishi, and I mean this literally because he slips and falls down some stairs and ends up kissing her. He wakes up in the nurses room, only to find out that he has switched bodies with Shiraishi! After figuring out what a little bit of what was going on, they are able to get switched back, but now Yamada has been thrust into a world he didn\u2019t even know existed.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this show brings about a special kind of emotion, mostly one of anger at times and one of happiness at other times. I was a little confused about how the plot went from 0-60 in the first three minutes, but it took 5 episodes to explain what exactly was going on and that made things a little confusing. Because of this I felt like it kind of pushed certain characters more than others, which kind of disappointing me because there was characters that I really wanted to see more of. Another amazing thing that I found from this show was the actual conclusion that it had. Rather than leave the story open to possibly a squeal or something like that, there was a real ending and it gave me an amazing sense of closure, not many shows do this. While it made me want to scream at times, Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches will go down on my list as one that made me feel, and took me to a world where anything is possible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 9.7/10 \\n",

            "content": "If I could summarize my viewing experience under one phrase, it would be this: what a pleasant surprise.\r\nMost wouldn't expect much -besides an abundance of eye rolling- from a gimcrack story about 7 witches and kissing galore, and I was no different to this opinion. But in a way, my cautiously low expectations gave way to an unexpected delight.\r\nYamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo is not a romance, it's a comedy. Well I mean, sure, there's romance involved but if that's what you're looking for, then the one you find here is sorely lacking in terms of depth and chemistry. I'd blame that more so onthe fact that our female MC, Shiraishi, is the definition of no personality. Unless you count her incessant obsession with academics and that one episode that addressed her social issues, she's got \"the emotional range of a teaspoon\" in Hermione Granger's words (yet another academically inclined character, but one with an actual personality). I don't know about you, but her rigid, expressionless exterior had nothing going for me.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's take a look at our other protagonist: Ryuu Yamada. While there isn't anything in particular to set him apart from other similar anime (no, not even his blazingly blue hair), he does a decent job of playing the likable MC. But the bigger reason why I enjoyed this one so much isn't our main leads, oh no; it's our side characters. People like Miyamura and Odagiri that dominated any scene they were in are what made this such a fun ride for me. Though I can't say the same for the entirety of the cast because a few of the witches were definitely more on the previously mentioned eye-roll inducing side\u2014 the playful humor, joyful atmosphere and light hearted comedy more than made up for it!\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of comedy, that element is precisely why this earned a solid 6.5 from me. When a show THIS predictable and THIS cheesy still manages to make me cackle at my screen, it's doing something right in my book.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if that isn't enough for you, then the attractive characters, the appealing art, and the unusually addictive opening should be reasons to give this one a shot in your free time.",

Each witch has a unique power that will vary between them (read minds, change body, erase memories ...). He receives the mission of the school representative to find all the witches (I will not tell you why not to spoil the surprise).\r\nOverall it's a very entertaining anime, it has a well-built romance and good drama, goodcharacters with motivations and who are quite charismatic. The animation is cool and has a reasonable soundtrack. The only defect is that there for half the anime gets a little coiled, but this does not last long (thank God).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also has a great plot twist that I honestly did not expect. Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo is a light anime that will probably make you laugh, get excited and have fun.",

            "content": "There are some vague spoilers in this.\r\nEver wonder what you get when you mix Kokoro Connect, Date a Live, and Haruhi? Well, probably not, but this show is the closest thing to it.\r\nYamada-kun and the Seven Witches follows Yamada and his friends in the Supernatural Studies Club as they try to find all seven \"witches\" who hold special powers in their high school. Sure, it's an original concept for a high school harem show, but originality doesn't save this ridiculous plot. Nothing is ever explained about the \"witches\" and the students always seem to figure out exactly what's going on even though the information theyhave about this phenomenon is little to none. The first four episodes gave me a different impression than what the show actually was. After the whole \u201cswitching bodies\u201d gimmick was established, I expected to see the hilariously wacky antics of a club who can switch bodies with each other. I don\u2019t know why I expected that; the title of the show obviously tells us that there are six more witches, so I guess that\u2019s my bad for thinking that. What ended up happening, though, was some overly dramatic version of The World God Only Knows. Yamada has to find all seven witches and kiss them. Why? They tried to make a weak explanation about how they needed to find all seven witches to stop the student council president from being bad, but we all know it was simply to build Yamada's harem. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the harem, that's something I can praise this show about. It's like a harem that's not a harem, because every girl doesn't ache in starvation for MC's dick. Even so, he still finds an excuse to kiss basically every character introduced.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, in the last few episodes, an unexpected crisis broke out and tried to make things seem dramatic and exciting, but I couldn't take the show seriously enough to worry about the characters at all. Oh, and the ending was weak and extremely predictable too. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the plot of this show is not good in the slightest. In fact, I'm more inclined to believe it's being satirical of the generic anime stereotypes: harems, magic witch girls, powers activate with a kiss, etc. In its defense, 12 episodes is not very much time to introduce the main characters, 7 other girls, and end the whole thing. Pacing issues (which there were plenty of) are almost inevitable. Another good thing they did was give a clear ending of the show, including both the story and the harem. All in all, I give the story a 3.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is high quality. I noticed this especially in the characters' eyes. Other than that, design-wise, there is nothing to complain about. All the girls look great and different. I give art a 7. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound isn't notable really. I do remember one background song that I liked, but that's it. As for voice acting, it was pretty average. Nothing was bad enough that it significantly worsened my viewing experience, but I didn't like Yamada's voice because he was always yelling and it got old quick. I give sound a 6.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the harem aspect, the characters are basically the main focus of the series. Yamada is a generic high school main character. At the beginning, he doesn't try in school, ends up befriending the most beautiful and smartest chick in the grade, and becomes overly protective of his two-week-old friends. Nothing new and nothing special about him. Shiraishi is the main female character. She's the \"quiet/smart girl\" and also not very special except for her top tier looks. Next we have Miyamura and Ito, the other initial members of the Supernatural Studies Club, who aren't very important to the story. The only reason they stick around is because they know about the witches' powers. Now we get to the harem. Every girl is made for a specific character type and aren't remarkable in any way except for being there for otaku nerds to pick and choose their favorite to fantasize about. Some of them appear for one episode then almost never again. There are some other characters introduced, like the evil student council president and some guy named Ushio who I still confuse with the other 2 supporting males. I give the characters a 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe show gets a 5 for enjoyment. In the beginning I was convinced it was the best show ever and would stand out as a beautiful diamond in the shitfield that is modern romance anime. As it went on, I soon realized it was no different than any other harem. The only reason I stuck it out for the last few episodes was because I heard beforehand that there was actual romantic development at the end so I guess there's that going for it. \\n\\n\r\nIn total I give the show a 5. It was all over the place and didn't ever decide on what genre it wanted to be. If you're watching it for a crappy harem, you'll probably enjoy the different take it provides. If you're watching for an actual romance/comedy, there is at least satisfying romance at the end except almost zero good comedy.",

But I couldn't help thinking that this was very similar to Kokoro connect, but instead of have some random alien mess with you, you have these witches that basically do the same thing. In addition, since there were so many characters and only 12 episodes, I felt like the story was rushed and I wasn't really able to get to know the characters --- I wasn't really able to get into it. The only thing I really ended up caring about in the end was the relationship betweenthe two main characters, but even that wasn't too well developed. Also, the flow was kind of confusing at times, especially with all the power stealing from the main character and the number of characters affected by these powers in one given episode. Art and music is good enough, not much to say as it didn't particularly stand out. I probably won't rewatch this anime again, but it's good for if you're looking for something cute and light hearted with a touch of magic.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying Harem style anime's aren't typically my favorite genre of anime, I have watched a few but it's very rare that I will willing pick up a Harem anime, I feel like if I wanted an anime simply for some fan service i'd much rather just watch a Yuri cause at least if the characters are dull and uninteresting I can still stand to \"look at them\"\r\nBut I feel like this anime was more of a \"Romance\" style anime than a Harem anime, in the end it had a huge aspect of Harem to it, a bunch of girls swooningover one main male but it really felt more like a love story between the 2 main characters Ryuu Yamada and Urara Shiraishi. Well the show tries to show the other witches as \"Attractive and Lovable\" in their own fashion i'd never say they tried to make it look like a relationship was forming between them and Ryuu Yamada (Besides a friendship) They definitely forced them into some humorous generic harem style situations but they kept the whole \"A bond forming between characters\" to Ryuu and Urara. This romance aspect was enough to keep me watching even with the dull story (more on that later.) Yes I know other characters do start to fall for Yamada after a while but it wasn't as nearly as bad as in a generic Harem anime, not every single character wanted to date him by the end and only wanted to be friends...\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, while the story was different and more interesting than other animes, it still felt dull and like nothing much really happened until the last few episodes, maybe it was the focus on the Harem aspect that made the entire flow of the show seem drawed out but it just felt like nothing was really happening, nothing impacted the story at all until the last few episodes and honestly I don't know if the build-up was worth it. I don't think the plot was bad it was somewhat unique and pretty interesting but for the first 8-9 episodes or so I just felt like I was watching some mind-numbing filler.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters we're probably the weakest part of the anime in my opinion, and surprisingly it wasn't the generic main male for once. I actually felt like the main male was the most interesting of the bunch and well he was a complete jerk he wasn't oblivious to everything and everyone around him. He slowly became more and more likable as the story progressed and honestly was probably the strongest character in the show, surprisingly the characters that were the least likable were all of the girls, they all just felt generic like some carbon fiber harem characters we've seen over and over. You have your stupid, shy but incredibly nice girl, the rude but after getting to know her she starts to be nicer however she still continues to tease the protagonist despite obviously liking him, and the quite and \"not interested in anything\" girl that has a lovable personality despite not saying much or doing anything. They were all extremely cute so that alone might be enough to suffer through them despite being extremely generic.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honestly this anime wasn't too great, if it wasn't for the ending it would definitely be below a 5 Stars on MAL but due to the plot picking up and the romance really building up towards the end it ended up being a decent anime, if you're willing to suffer through the starting episodes of just straight \"Borderline filler\" than i'd say go ahead and watch it but the only way you are going to be able to do that is if you find the characters to be extremely cute and attractive and luckily they mostly all are.",

It's a good time, and I enjoyed it.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story is pretty good, in my opinion. It's focused on its central goal of building the romance with the powers playing a role in moving this along. It is at its heart a romance story, not a supernatural one. There's also the added benefit of completely avoiding the harem trap. I feel like they have to rush the witches, though, given their twelve episode run.\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nThe art's nothing particularly stand-out, and is overall pretty generic. The character designs arefine, with each character standing out from one another pretty easily. Pantyshots inbound, though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe voice actors are great, the music's alright, but WOO the opening is awesome. Seriously, I love the opening, I listen to it on my own all the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters are all fine, and there's not TOO much troping (though the main character is an idiot, and the student council rules the school). We don't get too much development of the other witches, though, which is tied in to the rush that the episodes required.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI've become something of a sucker for romance anime, so I was pretty hype for the entire thing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

It does add a bit to the harem genre by actually adding someone who gets girls for at least some reason. Also it has okay mystery that does have its flaws but not a lot to make you hate the show. The story could have been a great parody that could have pulled a Date A Live (kind of, i have only seen 2 episodes of Date A Live) but it is pretty set on making the girls kiss this guy because PLOT. Also the story gets really confusing atthe end so i really didn't understand much. It takes talent to make up a story like this, not because its necessarily good but it does lead up to some good comedy. Comedy in this show is one thing this show does right but it does get a bit repetitive. The Romance is handled quite decently in this show as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is very good and the ending theme is quite nice as well. The soundtrack was pretty okay with a few forgettable moments but overall a decent listen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5.5/10\\n\\n\r\nA couple of characters have really good development but then the rest fall flat. This isn't a giant problem for some people but it can be annoying if you are critical. When they do decide to give the characters development it hits quite well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and character designs are quite nice in my opinion. It works for the show its on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\ni think this show doesn't need to be really plot heavy to be enjoyable. There are things that will stop you from enjoying to its highest but its still very enjoyable. Again, the comedy is pretty good, the characters are okay, and the romance is handled quite nicely.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show isn't bad at all, it is quite the opposite. It is an enjoyable watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat did you think of this show? Was it bad? Was it good?",

            "content": "\"Yamada-kun and the 7 Witches\" was a series that with the title, I assumed there would be a lot of harem scenes with considerable amounts of fanservice (as is with many harems). Surprisingly this wasn't the case. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe anime revolves around a group of students in the school who contain magical powers that are used through kissing someone. The main male character called Ryu Yamada is a delinquent who discovers this after accidentally falling on and kissing the school's ace, a girl named Urara Shiraishi, and realizing they switched bodies. They then join the Supernatural Studies Club thanks to one of the vice-presidents, Miyamura,and they go from there trying to find the other 6 witches and understand why they have these powers. The idea that witches are among the school is pretty interesting and the story had me pretty hooked and I liked the story overall. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art style was very pretty, I liked the character designs, especially for the girls in the series. Specifically, I did like the designs of Urara, Miyabi, Meiko and Noa. There was some scenes of fanservice but it wasn't so cringy as I expected it to be. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe OP was very catchy and nice and it really fit the series well. The ED was alright, but I felt it didn't fit the show, although it was nice. The songs throughout the show was also pretty nice. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime great are the characters and the interactions they have with each other. Each of the witches have their own issues that is shown in every episode, and it doesn't hold back to show their struggles in life. Not to mention, each of the characters have their own personality that sets them apart and it really makes them memorable- especially in moments where Yamada and Urara switch bodies. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThis show was very enjoyable, having scenes that were humorous or sad, and I really enjoyed the interactions between the characters, especially those of Yamada. One thing I didn't like was the Yaoi/Yuri scenes that occurred, especially with the kissing and in general, I cringed and felt uncomfrable. Either way, I was hooked with the plot, the comedy and the character interactions and I enjoyed it very much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nThis was an anime that I enjoyed very much and it was filled with characters I enjoyed very much. If you want something that involves romance, comedy, and supernatural aspects, I recommend this anime for you. This is a series I enjoyed and I liked it.",

            "content": "I went into this show with a strong recommendation and a lot of trepidation.  The concept of a body-swapping, kiss-fueled high-school comedy/drama seemed like just one big awkward moment, and I as a viewer have a fairly low tolerance for awkward moments to begin with.\r\nIt wasn't.  That isn't to say the characters didn't occasionally feel awkward -- in fact, they fairly frequently do but the audience is, I think by the quality of the voicework and writing, usually kept a step distant enough that it's easy even for someone like me to laugh instead of cringe.  That takes a good deal oftalent.\\n\\n\r\nI think the biggest point (or points) in the show's favor are the characters.  There are a lot of them that take to the limelight for at least an episode and all of them are at least decently entertaining to watch, being well-written, well-animated, and very well-voiced.  This is extra impressive because of the amount of body swapping and other magical character manipulation that's going on: the voices and movements are dead giveaways as to who is inhabiting what body right now and often if they're under any sort of altered status.  Sirashi, Yamada, and Odagiri are probably the best of the lot, as befits them getting a ton of screen time to show the depths of their character, but I find it hard to think of a character who wasn't at least a little rounded or who I never really felt any sympathy for.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, there are elements of the show, particularly the overarching story, that are only OK, but they're perfectly serviceable at worst, and the best stuff is very good.  This is a character driven piece more than it is a \"zany antics\" piece, and it can be very sweet, very heartfelt, occasionally dramatic, and usually at least a little humorous even if it's not going for laugh-out-loud comedy.",

But probably the aspect of casual kissing, even its purpose is power usage, it still annoyed me. Wasn't fond of it at all. This type of thing is fine in harem or ecchi shows because there usually all girls love 1 guy anyways and guy cares about them too. But this is more of a \"serious\" slice-of-life fantasy romance. Where only certain characters have romantic feelings for the main character. (or somethingalong the line, not expert at self-expression) Anyhow.. story might be unique, but wasn't as enjoyable for me. Plus  the aspect how casually after switching bodies were used/done/looked at or something along the line, wasn't fond as well.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\\n\r\nDid look great, subtle fanservice was also nice.
