            "content": "This is the first time I actually write a review, so please forgive me if I write it in a bad way. Also, this is purely based on my opinion.\r\nDespite reading the manga, I dropped this (for now, maybe I'll continue once it's finished airing) because so many things were wrong with this it wasn't funny anymore.\r\nStory:\r\nPretty much not existing at all. The characters lose sight of their goals and every 10th / 20th episode (This includes the \"old\" Fairy Tail as well) they suddenly remember it. \"Oh, right, we were looking for our dragon parents who vanished.\"\r\nThe \"story\" is made out of single arcswhich almost always don't have some kind of connection at all. One of the most serious problems Fairy Tail has, is seriousness. Of course, comedy is nice and all but sometimes the comedy is misplaced. \"Oh, we're trapped here and might die because we can't get any food - How about the girls strip and wear bikinis / sexy underwear so that the men will release us.\" I know Fairy Tail is infamous for its fanservice, and I am a fan of it as well, but Mashima should know when he should add fanservice and when not.\\n\\n\r\nBattles:\\n\r\nThe most important part of a Shonen anime and I almost always enjoy them.\\n\r\nBut not here. I am a tolerant watcher that can tolerate minor logic errors or slight friendship power-ups since nearly every Shonen has something like that. But Fairy Fail is overdoing it. Let me take one of the fights from this series as an example:\\n\r\nRufus:\\n\r\n\"I can use ancient magic, no one can beat me, I have all the magic in this LIBRARY and can even use ANCIENT / LOST magic nobody else can use. OH, I can also dissolve the magic of my opponent so that he can't use his magic anymore. I am SOOO gonna win this fight.\"\\n\\n\r\nGray:\\n\r\n\"I was being pwned by but thanks to my nakamas I can now counter the magic that screwed me up 2 seconds ago.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is just not okay. In the end it all comes down to opinions here but this fight was the pinnacle of stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are almost always stereotypical (Shounen) characters that can mostly be summed up with one or two words. They also don't get any major character development (If we exclude Gray and Erza, that is. (Then again, we only learned about their pasts. I doubt this can be called \"character development\", Mashima just seems to like these characters so he decided to give them some depth.)) which is very important in a Shonen anime. After 170 episodes Natsu is still the same idiot as in episode 1 that likes to show off. Nothing changed at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOutstanding / Awesome / Superb.\\n\r\nEasily the best part of the whole anime. The medieval soundtrack fits perfectly and is one of the best out there.\\n\\n\r\nArt / Animation style:\\n\r\nMany people complain about it but just as many people like it. The new animation style resembles the manga and is pretty damn good in my opinion. The character designs are now much better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI wouldn't have dropped the series if I enjoyed it, right?\\n\r\nDespite having enjoyed the first season, I can't bear to watch this one. I don't know what happened but it pains me to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nIt's probably a good Shonen anime if you didn't watch many animes yet, good thing for newcomers. If you just like me prefer animes with some depth this isn't a series for you.",

            "content": "Note: I wrote this review in the time of the filler arc.\r\n==Mild Spoilers==\r\nFairy Tail (2014) is the direct sequel of Fairy Tail which continued the Grand Magic Games Arc.\r\nNot only that many changes were made. Character designs are different but the biggest change happened is the change of studio which formerly was Satelight to Bridge (creators of Nobunagun and Devil Survivor 2)\r\nThe thing is the sequel did not solve any problems the Fairy Tail has. It only got worse. Its still has bad story, bad characters, and bad writing and this was added by the horrible animation. Bridge is very inconsistent in animating. The firstepisode has exemplary animation but this was the opposite on the next episode. This is still continuing up to now. Some episodes have great visuals but some were not. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters did not change too. They were still bland and badly written. Natsu is still the same stupid protagonist with the powa of friendship. Unlike Gray and Erza, his character did not have the chance to develop. Most Fairy Tail characters are like that. This is dragging the story down. Their personalities actually is the cause of the repeatedness of the storyline. The resolve to protect their friends is actually the cause why the same thing happens over and over.\\n\\n\r\nEvery arc didn\u2019t change at all. It was still still like this:\\n\\n\r\nVillain appears \u21d2 Hurts some Fairy Tail members \u21d2 Natsu got angry \u21d2 Fairy Tail fight the villain \u21d2 Fairy Tail won either by some Deus ex Machina or Powa of Friendship\\n\\n\r\nAlmost all the arcs was like that. It became worse at the end of the Eclipse arc. The end of the Eclipse arc in the manga angered many people leading them to drop Fairy Tail. That end was a actual Deus ex Machina. And now another tedious filler arc is still airing in Fairy Tail 2014\\n\\n\r\nAs always Fairy Tail\u2019s music is still amazing. Still has the same composer. Fairy Tail\u2019s iconic soundtrack change a bit but nevertheless still amazing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Fairy Tail (2014) failed to solve the problems its facing and only got worse. But nevertheless I will not drop this for the reason this is my gateway anime and I want to see it ending with my own eyes and see how they animate Tartarus arc\\n",

            "content": "This is a 100% spoiler free review of  Fairy Tail (2014) the sequel to Fairy Tail - An anime that  I thoroughly enjoyed watching for 175 episodes and consider as one of my favorite anime.\r\nI know what you are probably thinking,\"there's already dozens of low rated reviews for this anime, despite it having such a high MAL rating; how is this not just another troll review by a typical fairy tail hater.\" So I would like to clarify that this is a 100% serious review with no hate specifically towards Fairy Tail or the shounen genre.\r\nSo if you have not seen either FairyTail or Fairy tail(2014) then you are probably sitting down with a puzzled look on your face wondering why anyone would give a continuation of one of their favorite anime such a low rating.\\n\r\nThe answer is pretty simple; this is not the anime that I fell in love with, it is not the anime that i spent over 50 hours watching and it certainly isn't an anime I would recommend to my friends or to the members of MAL. It is just a poor sequel to a popular anime; with drastic quality reductions and sub-par animation to milk more money from it's targeted audience.\\n\\n\r\nStory + Fights : 4/10\\n\r\nSince this review is a continuation for Fairy Tail i presume you already know the basic plot and most likely consider the Grand Magic Games arc that ended halfway in the original was one of the best arcs in Fairy Tail, and are eagerly waiting to carry on.\\n\r\nThis is where I would like to state my opinion - Yes, the grand magic games arc started off amazing, but it honestly isn't worth carrying on. \\n\r\nIn Fairy Tail 2014, the pacing of the fights is honestly dreadful. \\n\\n\r\nWe all got into Fairy Tail for the fast paced,action packed fights didn't we?\\n\\n\r\nWell there is no more of that anymore, instead you are forced to wait 5 episodes in the hopes of watching decent fight, only to realize that it lasts for mere minutes being switched to a different fight which u clearly don't have any interest in, or some characters talking about some plot which is clearly not important  and  only exists so that the anime can drag a fight for 4 episodes longer than is should be.\\n\r\nHonestly Natsu vs Sting and Rogue in the original Fairy Tail is 100x better than fight there will ever be in the second season. Do yourselves a favor and savor this fight as your last Fairy Tail memory otherwise you will regret ruining your views on such an enjoyable series.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation + Art : 2/10\\n\r\nThis is very much my biggest problem with Fairy Tail 2014, remember the epic battles with amazing animation and colorful abilities. Well that isn't the case anymore in Fairy Tail 2014; instead you should expect clunky character movement and animation, incorrect and totally absurd body proportions - I am not even joking sometimes you will notice characters half the size of the rest of the cast, and other times you will see characters with the tiniest heads and smallest bodies. But the thing that completely dwindled my faith in the animation for the Fairy Tail 2014 is the fights; it seems as if  half the battle seems to be cut out of the picture, the abilities used are half animated and the screen often shifts to the characters so the studio doesn't have to animate the rest of the ability, instead we see stupid crap; such as a zoom in on Natsu as his enemies are sent flying into the air, without us even seeing him remotely use his abilities. The new modern style that the studio tried to use in this production is clearly not working and greatly takes away from what we all loved about Fairy Tail.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\r\nThe one part of Fairy Tail that will always be amazing; the OP, the ED and the OST are still amazing, everyone already knows that the soundtracks to Fairy Tail are some of the best you will ever see, and this season is no disappointment in that regard, rarely will you find poor music in Fairy Tail and even in such a poor season it is still exceptional\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 5/10\\n\r\nThis sequel is nothing like the prequel; every single aspect of the show from animation to battles has taken a drastic drop in quality, and has gotten to the point where you are better off looking elsewhere for the shounen action you desire. Yes, you may have developed an attachment to the amazing cast of characters in Fairy Tail or the concept of magic and the wide array of intricate powers out there in Earthland but trust me when I say that even the exceptional music and sound in Fairy Tail won't save you from being disappointed in the downwards progression of all the other aspects of Fairy Tail.\\n\\n\r\nHowever you can still find some enjoyment in this series, it isn't complete trash and is still watchable, some of you may enjoy it, so don't let this review stop you! Decide for yourselves if you think that it will be worth it. Yet, I still do not recommend it.\\n",

Then I watched the opening of the new Fairy Tail 2014. I had realised something, the WHOLE fucking plot was spoiled in the opening. The fact that you get to see which characters battle one another and the fact that there is a dark silhouette in the shape of a dragonhas completely destroyed the potential of story development due to the fact that the plot line has already been told in the op.\\n\\n\r\nI also wanted to mention the distinctive and disgraceful animation in the new season.\\n\\n\r\nIn 2 words it would probably described as: Picture Drama.\\n\\n\r\nYou know when there is a special or an OVA for a really awesome anime you are reluctant to watch due to the fact that the entire episode is photos frame by frame? Yes, that is what Fairy Tail 2014 has become.\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, if the amazing soundtrack combined with the funny sense of humour is something you would enjoy, then I would suggest you watch this for only the comedic moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this has been a massive let-down from the first season and as an avid Fairy Tail fan I would suggest to read the manga instead of wasting your time on the anime.",

            "content": "EDITED: THIS REVIEW ENCOMPASSES THE WHOLE 102 EPISODES OF FAIRY TAIL (2014)\r\n*NOTE: Due to the nature of this series some comparisons between the new series and the original run will arise but generally this review is spoiler free.\r\n Fairy Tail (2014) was a highly anticipated sequel to the original run  of Fairy Tail which lasted from 2009 to 2013. Now the original anime wasn't anything special or groundbreaking by any means however it was an anime that managed to avoid the majority of the pitfalls associated with long running anime like Naruto, Bleach etc. Sure it had the 'plot convenient' power ups andthe 'power of friendship' cliches but it still managed ti garner a pretty huge and devout fan following. The main reasons were the fact that it had extremely consistent animation, brilliant soundtracks and very likable characters along with interesting arcs that didn't drag on and fights that were short and sweet. I confess that i was among that devout fan following and loved FT like it was the greatest anime ever (this was about 3 years ago mind you) so how is it that a fan like me is giving this sequel such a low score? Lets begin...\\n\\n\r\nStory: . The pacing of the story  is horribly inconsistent and extremely slow paced. There are some episode that will try to fit in a lot of content in the space of just one episode and others where there will be nothing of consequence done over the course of many episodes, a problem that arises from dragging out episodes is the extremely corny dialogue that is quite often cringe worthy. Now a typical aspect of shounens is 'hyping up' every battle and every showdown for eg Shokugeki no Souma does this excellently. Fairy tail tries but fails miserably at this not because of its inability to hype up sequences but because of the inability to follow up on it which leads to extremely boring battles and plot conclusions. Also many of the most interesting characters including Erza, Zeref, Jellal etc suffer deeply from a lack of screen time. Plot holes run rampant in this anime and character motivations are seldom explored. An example i would like to mention here form the series is the FT zero arc which animated 13 chapters in the space of almost 10 episodes, this is by no means helpful to the pacing of the series and means that episodes drag on aimlessly because of the little content that they get to adapt.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: As i mentioned before Fairy tail mainly drew me in because of its consistent animation however that is not the case any more. FT tries to experiment with a new animation style that resembles the manga but in colour it doesn't look quite as good. The biggest letdown in terms of animation is,  unlike the first series, inconsistency. BG are well drawn but during battles many characters look nothing more than doodles (naruto anyone?). Another problem is the extremely bland colour template, for some reason the colours are towards the  dark side and this does not fit the previous series' cheery looking vibrant colours. \\n\\n\r\nSound: This is hands down the best aspect of the anime. All of the OPs and EDs are very well done and continue the legacy of the original's brilliant soundtracks. Some tracks that have stuck with me are 'Masayume Chasing', 'Believe in myself' and 'Ashita wa Orase' all of which are eargasmic. The osts on the other hand are overused but still are acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Due to the inconsistent and slow nature of the story the characters don't really have a chance to shine like they did in the original. Many interesting character's like laxus, erza, gajeel, jellal etc are thrown into the background and only appear rarely. Their development has remained stagnant over the course of these 102 episodes. Many important moments from the manga that are important in fleshing out the characters were animated without any of the emotional drama and this means that character emotions look forced and overdramatic. Natsu is much the same and Lucy is still quite useless as a MC. Zeref is sorely missed and only appears in about 4 episodes despite the fact that he is the main antagonist. The rest of the antagonists are not nearly as interesting and their motivations are petty to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Probably the only reason that i have stuck with this anime for so long is the feeling of nostalgia i got every week i sat down and watched another episode, but nostalgia can only take you so long and at some point watching it became nothing more than a chore, devoid of enjoyment and the love that i once had for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI am honestly shocked at how such an amazing  anime has been ruined, it is now nothing more than a shadow if its past glory and is a prime example of how greedy studios can turn an interesting show into a shitty cash grab. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for taking the time out to read this long review and any feedback is greatly appreciated since this is my first review.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fairy Tail 2014 is the sequel to the original Fairy Tail anime that aired from 2009-2013. It's actually an upgrade in many ways from the previous anime despite having a shaky beginning with their budget it seems (Early episodes have varying quality throughout). Let's just be clear, this is still the same Fairy Tail everyone knows and loves. \r\nStory: I think a lot of the problems people have with the 2014 series is that the beginning of it is the second half of the Grand Magic Games (Which for whatever reason is the most critically panned non filler arc of the series, so it beingthe first arc affects people's ratings) and then it goes straight into a filler arc afterwards. I agree, it's unfortunate the sequel anime to the original Fairy Tail got shackled by 2 arcs in a row that \"most\" people didn't like (I actually loved the Grand Magic Games, but understand I'm in the minority). \\n\\n\r\nRecently however, the anime has been on track to reclaiming its former greatness. Adapting the popular sidestory omake chapters and starting the Tartarus (or Tarataros) arc have seen the budget and artwork increase, and storywise the series has never been better. This arc is pretty much the epitome of greatness concerning Hiro Mashima's writing. Each of the main cast members get something awesome to do in this arc, and it features some of the best plot twists in the series.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Even if the earlier episodes were filled with inconsistent artwork, the DVD releases actually fix up a lot of noticeable problems, so for the sake of my review I'll use those redone episodes as the basis and the current quality of the Tartarus arc. While the first anime made things too colorful and purposely avoided blood, Fairy Tail 2014 takes that darker step and makes the color palette closer to the original manga, and even adds blood into scenes! (There could be more blood though, but that's just a nitpick at best. It's still better the original Fairy Tail in that regard).\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound track for the series continues to be superb. While some of the original tracks from the first Fairy Tail do make reappearances as remixed versions of themselves, most of the OST in this series is brand new. The Tartarus arc especially has some great new darker themes (With demon chanting) that definitely sets the mood, on top of having the soul pumping kickass main theme when main characters kick ass.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Oh boy, where Fairy Tail has always shined is its cast of characters and the 2014 series is no exception. You have your main 5 cast members from the previous series returning: Natsu, Erza, Gray, Lucy, and Wendy. Then you have all the various side characters from their guild and all the other guilds. Every character gets a chance to shine, and it's hard to not have a favorite in a show where so many characters get ample amounts of screentime. Certain characters, like Gray, especially have seen some major development and focus in the 2014 series due to certain story sequences, more so than he did in the original Fairy Tail anime. \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Definitely love watching Fairy Tail each week with my friends and family. We have come a long way from getting still frames, magic circles, and reused battle animation to where we are now. I would even go as far to say that now the animated action clearly outshines the manga.  \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: In conclusion, I have to say that Fairy Tail 2014 has surpassed the old series in nearly every category. It really annoyed me that so many people were rating this series 4s and 5s based off just watching the first few episodes but not waiting to see how this adaptation would turn out. I'm hoping many people find my review helpful and that it encourages them to watch to at least the Tartarus arc to see if they'll like the new series or not. Fairy Tail 2014 gets a 10/10 overall.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Picking up where the series last left off, A-1 pictures adapts Hiro Mashima's Fairy Tail at the Magical Games Arc. Now before I can actually review it, a lot of my gripes with series stems from the one before it and it's not like it's two separate series of continuity. \r\nI didn't hate watching Fairy Tail at first. But the deeper I got into it, the more I felt it squandered all the potential it had at the start. In the end, I couldn't help but see it as the most generic shonen ever - it was as if the author ticked all the boxes(stupid male characters with predictable quirks, average-smart females of the needs-saving variety, power of friendship, fanservice, magic power systems, climbing-ranks-and-being-the-best goals, etc.) that are supposed to make a shonen series good, but failing to actually give arcs substance as a whole to make the world believable.\\n\\n\r\nWhile ever long running show has weaknesses, the others take their setting making most of their unique world and dilemmas. Fairy Tail on the other hand doesn't seem to be getting plot or character developments done. Yes, a few things do happen that seem to affect more than just that arc, but in the end, there isn't even a depth and it remains as shallow as ever.\\n\\n\r\nNOW, why did I keep watching? The first Fairy Tail's glorious osts and it was actually mindless entertainment for the most part. But now that they changed it, while I'm open to change, the music just doesn't mesh well with it. The show also tries too hard to make itself funny and the animation seems to have taken a turn for the worst. I might pick it up some time but I've dropped it for now.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it's okay-ish if you're brand new to the anime but Fairy Tail never brings anything new to the table that you've probably seen in other shows. If if you're thinking about watching this show, you're better off with another of the Big Three (One Piece, Naruto, and Bleach), Dragon Ball Z, or Hunter X Hunter.",

It should have been in the best. Any way lets get to the point.\r\nThis season comprise of 4 arcs although the last arc (10 episodes) are not that interesting because they go to way before past where fairy tail wasnt even borne yet still the other 3 arcs are full of action and entertainment. Its a total blast of shounen. Although i too believethat this season was not funny like the previous one but that was because this time they took a rather serious way to deal things as the troubles this time were greater than ever.\\n\r\nThe dialogues the feelers and the chills of excitement are filled in this season and the one thing that has advanced is the fighting style. It is superb this time not to say that it was not superb the previous time but this time it was on a far whole level.\\n\r\nSo i believe one should watch this anime regardless of the size because after watching it you will find your true self, you will start to believe in yourself and also a sense of  goodwill will be born within you regarding your loved ones. this anime will boost your courage and fill you with enthusiasm.\\n\\n\r\nthe only problem this anime had like always with all other fairy tail animation is poor execution of the animation fluidity, its not smooth, this hamperssome of the fun but ...\\n\\n\r\nOne should really watch this anime with full interest and i am sure you will enjoy it so best of luck with it. I hope you liked my review even though it seemed a little unrealistic.",

            "content": "Fairy Tail 2014 is the sequel to Fairy Tail starting off right where the other one left off, in the grand magic games arc. (Not going to go into detail about the story since most of those reading this will have already watched the first one) So Lucy a main female character is captured and now the gang has to go and bust her out of prison guns (magic) blazing right? Well, no. They sneak in to save her (Which is totally the smart thing to do) but right after they do they fall into a trap and now they have to escape the placeor die. There lies the problem with these first few episodes, they spend a lot of tine dragging things out with fan service and constantly switching back and forth between the grand magic games. \\n\\n\nThe early fights, (seeing as there are only 9 episodes out right now) are boring and don't give an intense feel like the first one does, (which I really enjoyed) all the fights this time either, drag out too long or doesn't even last for a good length of the episode (although do the the constant switching between fights the battles usually last an episode or 2). \\n\\n\nThe cast of characters didn't change and if you like how they were in Fairy Tail, you'll like em just as much in this one. All the characters though are pretty much just classic stereotypical shounen characters that we've all seen. The cast doesn't get much development (except for Ezra, Lucy, a little on Wendy, and a little on Gray.) seeing as Natsu is still the same bumbling idiot that attracts all sorts of trouble (probably my favorite character though.) The thing that really saves and stands out about these characters are their interactions.\\n\\n\nThe music is good, but the first opening is (arguably) worse than the first one.\\n\\n\nAlthough it's very early to be saying this, I personally like the first one better and didn't get as much enjoyment out of this one as I did in the first one. There are many better anime this spring season (my opinion) than Fairy Tail right now such as No Game No Life and Haikyuu. I believe that Fairy Tail 2014 was just too hyped or \"fanboys\" just gave Fairy Tail 2014 the scores it has just because it's back or they are blinded to the flaws and think IT'S THE BEST ANIME IN THE WORLD! (there are those who do genuinely believe that it deserves a 10 who are or are not \"fanboys\".) \\n\\n\nIt may seem like I'm hating on Fairy Tail but... okay I am hating on it a bit because of the crazy amount of 10s it has for almost no reason and being higher ranked than shows I believe to be far superior (such as No Game No Life, Kuroko no Basket, and Chihayafuru) but I am a fan and will be following it.",

            "content": "Since the anime adaptation of Fairy Tail began in 2009, the franchise has established itself as a moneymaking machine. In fact, it appears that it is well on its way to establishing itself among the likes of Naruto and One Piece as one of those series that just doesn't seem to have any end in sight.\r\nI was actually a fan of Fairy Tail during its initial run. Quirky characters, attractive designs, a lot of humor, it was just good fun. The story arcs were also, for the most part, pretty decent. There was character development and each episode kept me engaged. Unfortunately, now that FairyTail's renewed run is well underway, it seems that almost all of the original appeal has been lost.\\n\\n\r\nDespite picking up right in the middle of a story arc, I can't help but feel like the pacing has been turned down to a minimum. There are far too many episodes in which virtually nothing happens to advance the plot and leaves me feeling like I just wasted 20 minutes. In the currently ongoing Grand Magic Games arc, the plot feels bogged down by too many elements and its progression is hindered by the series' continuous attempts to juggle numerous battles/situations in one episode. The result is that we get a quick glimpse of each separate, but simultaneously occurring situation, bouncing back and forth, and the show ultimately takes far too long to reach key plot points. From what I recall, the show's initial run did not have such atrocious pacing issues.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation there is nothing new or improved here. It's essentially the same as it was when it last left off and budget constraints are painfully evident in almost every episode. You'd think such a popular show would be able to allocate more resources to animation, but I guess not. (For those of who watching for the fanservice, there's still plenty of that.)\\n\\n\r\nFunnily enough, perhaps the thing that I find the most lacking is the absence of the original Fairy Tail theme. I'm a big fan of it and I felt more than a little disappointed upon noticing that it had been omitted in the renewed run. The soundtrack just feels dull without it. On the bright side, though, both OPs so far have been excellent (although you know there's a problem when the OP is more exciting than the actual episode).\\n\\n\r\nAlthough its redeeming factors are few and far between, as long as new episodes continue to be made, people will keep watching, and the producers will keep making money. Of course, being based on a manga, it's unfair to place all the blame on the producers. Most of Fairy Tail's fundamental flaws can be chalked up to bad source material. I may keep watching just out of some curiosity about what happens next, but in all likelihood I will probably be dropping Fairy Tail sooner rather than later.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Since 2014 is over I think it's appropriate to write a short review of how I felt about Fairy Tail in 2014. I watched all of the Previous episodes so of course I had some expectations going into this season. \r\nAlmost none of those expectations were met.\r\nThe fight scenes are terrible and leave so much to be desired. The humor isn't funny anymore. The dialogue is cringe-worthy at times. Natsu has become a pansy. I haven't felt any satisfaction from anything that has happened so far this season. \r\nOverall Fairy Tail feels like it has become exclusively an anime for children and young teens. Butthen there's the raunchy fan-service and Lucy getting naked for no good reason so that probably isn't the case. After some censoring it's one of those shows I'd expect to be on Disney XD on Saturday mornings. It's like a 4Kids dub and it hasn't even been dubbed yet.\\n\\n\r\nIt suffers from the biggest case of \"main character gets his ass kicked and somehow pulls through at the end with the power of friendship\" that I've ever seen. And if you've watched Fairy Tail since the beginning you know it's always been suffering from this. It really feels like they sacrificed Natsu's awesomeness for the sake of hilarity (Natsu gets beaten around by low-tier enemies and screams wildly while it happens) except it isn't funny. Remember how epic it was when Natsu finally got serious and had that look in his eyes like nothing better stand in his way? Yeh, none of that happens either.\\n\\n\r\nEverything that happens is completely predictable 5 minutes before it happens. This isn't an exaggeration. Fairy Tail is riddled with so many tropes it's like the writers went to TVtropes and said \"yeh this looks good, let's put this in the show.\" Everything follows the same tired formula over and over and over. \\n\\n\r\nOne good thing that remains is the music. Fairy Tail always had great music that was unlike any other show out there. Also, many people aren't too fond of the new art but I think it's a step up from the previous seasons. Maybe that's just me.\\n\\n\r\nSo maybe Fairy Tail is going through a slump and it'll make me eat my words this year. I really hope that's the case. But as far as 2014 goes, Fairy Tail was forgettable and almost laughable.",

            "content": "Fairy tails climatic peak at the end of first series left a sweet taste in the mouths in some people returning for the second season, and left others with the kind which isn't so nice. There have been many revamps from animation to soundtrack, but don't worry, it still keeps its story as shallow as a puddle in the Sahara (basically it's non existent).\r\nThe story directly connects season 1 to season 2, and continues from the current grand magic games, where Natsu and fairy tail come up against other guilds for the crown of the best in Fiore. Problems arise, and fairy tail are ina race against time for more reasons than one.\\n\\n\r\nDon't worry folks, it may have changed its image, but this shounen story sticks at what it does best, bad writing disguised as \"epic, brilliant, wowza!\". Fairy tails usual pacing is very rushed due to it's build up to arcs and fights described in simple terms with little or no thought of tactics or strategy. Furthermore, the atmosphere exudes a lack of seriousness, due to comedy being introduced at the wrong time. This eventually leads to emotional events and fights to not be taken seriously enough, because care and attention to detail is skipped for a quick thrill. It's also a \"the strongest fighter wins\" storyline and is concluded with short fights that have a rinsed and repeated story line, where random power ups occur and no real explanation is given as to how fairy tail truly win. This is where the dues ex machina comes in, as Fairy tail will be in a hopeless position to winning a fight in seconds. Unfortunately, this formula still exists. This eventually leads to Fairy tail frustratingly becoming more and more predictable in its fights and story line as time goes on. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of this, there's something about fairy which can easily let's you give into the childish, cheesy jokes once in a while. You can find yourself almost getting swept up in its hype sometimes, as it is shounen after all. Then again, bad writing eventually acts as the nail in the coffin for fairy tail.\\n\\n\r\nThe second major revamp clearly seen by Fairy tail 2 is the animation. Everyone's loving characters from Natsu to Laxus have all had a good wipe down, and are looking pretty neat. The designs are much more sharper, and this has had a direct impact on the fan service too, with every bussom being as big as before. Unfortunately further evidence of frame rate drops make another shameful comeback, which is surprising and ridiculous coming from a very recent anime.\\n\\n\r\nWith characters however, we still have the same, rememberable cast, with Natsu, Lucy, Erza and Gray still battling it out for the guild. The characters are very much the shounen stereotypes, Natsu the tough guy, Lucy the damsel who constantly tries to prove her worth all the time, Erza the overpowered typhoon ect. But only a few drops of character development reach some of these characters like Gray and Erza. This equates to each character never really changing after certain events. In the end, it's almost as if they have a limited set of phrases or ways to act because they are never changing. This is especially seen in Natsu, who hasn't changed from episode 1. To sum then up, the characters of fairy tail wholly offer very few rememberable moments, but will be rememberable for being a stereotypical cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe last overhaul comes from the music department, as a new series lead to a new soundtrack. The opening song unfortunately gave away spoilers, plus it wasn't very memorable. The OST however is top notch, it really does bring fights an extra essence of battle to them. The ending unfortunately catered to those whose life long dream it is to ship characters, not my thing.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Fairy Tail left me wanting to wash my mouth out. There are many flaws from the old season carried on into this season and nothing has been done to address them. In fact, it turns to glorify them instead. I would only recommend for those new to shounen anime, other than that, it's not worth your time.",

            "content": "As someone who has pretty much marathon-watched all the fairy tails in the past few months I was quite surprised to see the rather paltry scores the 2014 version achieved.\r\nThe major concern people seem to have is with the story and writing. In a shounen battle anime.\r\nThis seemed a bit odd to me.\r\nThat isn't to say that the story and writing aren't fairly poor, of course. They rely upon the same clich\u00e9s in each arc. The writing is predictable and, hell, the characters even have catch-phrases.\r\nBut does any of that really matter for a shounen battle anime?\r\nI would say no. What matters most in abattle anime - especially one as lighthearted as Fairy Tail, - are the battles and the slapstick. It's dumb entertainment, to put it bluntly. But who watches such a thing and expects to be challenged mentally? That's like watching a horror and expecting romance and drama that makes you cry and feel along with the actors.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it I did not notice a major drop in quality between this series and the previous. The animation can be outstanding on some episodes and lazy on others. Only half of the characters have actually had a major amount of development but that development is noticeable and included in the writing.\\n\r\nThe sound design is also outstanding. Everything from the music to the VAs used. And on the whole it's just a fun series. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enter it with the knowledge that, yes, a shounen battle anime has clich\u00e9s out the arse and yes, it won't challenge you mentally then you're pretty much good to go. Fairy Tail is dumb feel-good entertainment. And it's pretty good at being what it is. Because sometimes it's nice to have something that isn't very serious.",

Despite the popularity, it's probably more hated than Sword Art Online and Boku no Pico, and that's saying something.\r\nI'm writing this review as fairly as possible. \r\nSTORY:\r\n The new series carried on from the previous (Grand Magic Games arc). Since the end of the arc, there were about five arcs (Eclipse Celestial Spirit Arc + omake, Sun Village Arc, Tartaros Arc, Tenrou Jade Arc and the first two episodes of Avatar Arc).\r\nDuring the one-year time skip within the series, we also saw Mavis' back-story in the Tenrou Jade Arc or Fairy Tail Zero as it's known to somepeople.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the manga and the omake manga. There was only one true filler arc throughout.\\n\\n\r\n The main disappointment is ending the series two episodes into a new arc.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\n The art was noticeably different, and was still bright and vivid - until the Sun Village Arc. During this arc and the following arcs, the animation colours seemed to gain a purple filter - that's the only way I can describe it, but it was around that time that the story no longer immersed me, because I was agitated with the new colours.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\n The soundtracks, oh my.\\n\r\n Acnologia could have been voiced by someone who knows how to truly sound badass.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\n The characters were more fleshed out during the omake.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\n I have to give this a lower rating than its predecessor. This is mostly down to the artwork involved. It's the main area that let down the series for me, to the point where it is no longer in my top 5 series.",

            "content": "Fairy Tail is one of those long-running series many ridicule, and I understand that. I see the flaws just as much as any outsider does. I get pissed off the characters' being overpowered without any reason or proof of having acquired them most of the time. The whole \"Friendship is magic\" is literally everything in Fairy Tail and it gets too fucking old. But, it is also because of that, that I fell in love with it. I love the concept of family and unity and shit like that. I'm a sucker for those things and Fairy Tail is all about that. Also, all theover-the-top revelations for this series have been really fucking awesome. I love the character interactions and the way they genuinely bond.\\n\\n\r\n You can't make me memorize the names of hundreds of characters but you don't need to force me to do that for FT. I know the Fairy Tail members by heart, because they are able to make you feel like you are part of their journey. Yes, FT has so many short-comings when it comes to the action and story-telling, but there is charm in this one that many people fall in love with which is why it is still popular to so many.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that these sort of long-running shounen series are not for everybody, and it's certainly not something you watch if you want to get deep shit from it. When watching such shows, you have to take it in raw and as light-hearted as possible. You don't need to think. You just have to watch the shit. No analyzing shit or so on, because you're only going to be wasting your time.\\n\\n\r\nTo end, I have enjoyed this immensely as I have already been a fan since before. This direct sequel has more or less the same elements and aspects as the previous one. Just more \"boom\" and more questions answered for some of the characters' unknown pasts. Try it if you will, and don't if you're not up for it. It's as simple as that.\\n",

It's pretty easy to see.\r\n- SOUND - 10 - Fairy Tail has some of the best soundtracks and music I've heard in any anime. IT has amazing openings (*COUGH* the first one *COUGH*), and has really good endings as well. \r\n- CHARACTERS -10 - Thisis another many people say are weak. Many dislike the some of the main characters, I even dislike a few characters in this show, but they are still amazing! Almost every character has their own respective back story, (unfortunately they are almost all sad, if not all of them) but they are all very interesting in their own way, and they are all powerful in their own way. \\n\\n\r\n- ENJOYMENT - 10 - I enjoy this anime a lot, and enjoy all of it, from the epic fights to the sad back stories, it is amazing. I just have to warn you, it has very heavy fan service, but don't let that stop you! :)",

(but thats just my opinion) \\n\\n\r\nthere are some more minor things about this anime... but the point is... it's too predictable... and i think is so overrated. but let me just say this again.. this is all my opinion. i dont expect everyone to agree with me. i know a lot will disagree.. but it's just my opinion. and i think that if, like me, you are more into anime that is serious and goes pretty deep ( the plot) then you most likely will not like this anime. but if youre new to anime, or if u just want to watch some hyper anime( just for fun) with fan service, or if u dont like anime with a deep plot...  then yeah.. you'll probably like this anime... or you can probably give it a go and see. \\n\\n\r\ni dont know if what i said actually looks like a review..  but... yeah...  it is my first time... and it is just my opinion.... and im not saying that fairy tail is a terrible anime ( okay maybe i think it is) but still, i know that there are many people that enjoy it....",

So ummm I guess I should start at how the action scenes here aren't awesome as they use to be during the last seasons boring fights takes longer this and the awesome ones takes like a few minutes of the episode. I'm still not over how they don't actually add blood but just stain them in clothes or hands. I'm expecting more from this. We have several episodes to come so I'm hoping something can be more improved here .I'm digging the new style too but I also miss the old style.\r\nArt 8/10: Ilike it and the high quality it gives but I'm just so used to the old style and I feel like it's better but this one is like the one in the movie well a little bit .\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10: Seriously, the story is really unique about a huge gate linking the past and future and dragons. The strongest wizard being someone of darkness.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: Lucy became like a model for fan services in the past episodes. Where the heck are the other characters like Gildarts?! Man , where does that guy even go\\n\\n\r\nBut despite some flaws I enjoy really much and that I'm happy watching it or rewatching it or ok ok ok fine I'm done x'D",

            "content": "This is the first time I actually write a review, so please forgive me if I write it in a bad way. Also, this is purely based on my opinion.\r\nDespite reading the manga, I dropped this (for now, maybe I'll continue once it's finished airing) because so many things were wrong with this it wasn't funny anymore.\r\nStory:\r\nPretty much not existing at all. The characters lose sight of their goals and every 10th / 20th episode (This includes the \"old\" Fairy Tail as well) they suddenly remember it. \"Oh, right, we were looking for our dragon parents who vanished.\"\r\nThe \"story\" is made out of single arcswhich almost always don't have some kind of connection at all. One of the most serious problems Fairy Tail has, is seriousness. Of course, comedy is nice and all but sometimes the comedy is misplaced. \"Oh, we're trapped here and might die because we can't get any food - How about the girls strip and wear bikinis / sexy underwear so that the men will release us.\" I know Fairy Tail is infamous for its fanservice, and I am a fan of it as well, but Mashima should know when he should add fanservice and when not.\\n\\n\r\nBattles:\\n\r\nThe most important part of a Shonen anime and I almost always enjoy them.\\n\r\nBut not here. I am a tolerant watcher that can tolerate minor logic errors or slight friendship power-ups since nearly every Shonen has something like that. But Fairy Fail is overdoing it. Let me take one of the fights from this series as an example:\\n\r\nRufus:\\n\r\n\"I can use ancient magic, no one can beat me, I have all the magic in this LIBRARY and can even use ANCIENT / LOST magic nobody else can use. OH, I can also dissolve the magic of my opponent so that he can't use his magic anymore. I am SOOO gonna win this fight.\"\\n\\n\r\nGray:\\n\r\n\"I was being pwned by but thanks to my nakamas I can now counter the magic that screwed me up 2 seconds ago.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is just not okay. In the end it all comes down to opinions here but this fight was the pinnacle of stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are almost always stereotypical (Shounen) characters that can mostly be summed up with one or two words. They also don't get any major character development (If we exclude Gray and Erza, that is. (Then again, we only learned about their pasts. I doubt this can be called \"character development\", Mashima just seems to like these characters so he decided to give them some depth.)) which is very important in a Shonen anime. After 170 episodes Natsu is still the same idiot as in episode 1 that likes to show off. Nothing changed at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOutstanding / Awesome / Superb.\\n\r\nEasily the best part of the whole anime. The medieval soundtrack fits perfectly and is one of the best out there.\\n\\n\r\nArt / Animation style:\\n\r\nMany people complain about it but just as many people like it. The new animation style resembles the manga and is pretty damn good in my opinion. The character designs are now much better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI wouldn't have dropped the series if I enjoyed it, right?\\n\r\nDespite having enjoyed the first season, I can't bear to watch this one. I don't know what happened but it pains me to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nIt's probably a good Shonen anime if you didn't watch many animes yet, good thing for newcomers. If you just like me prefer animes with some depth this isn't a series for you.",

            "content": "Note: I wrote this review in the time of the filler arc.\r\n==Mild Spoilers==\r\nFairy Tail (2014) is the direct sequel of Fairy Tail which continued the Grand Magic Games Arc.\r\nNot only that many changes were made. Character designs are different but the biggest change happened is the change of studio which formerly was Satelight to Bridge (creators of Nobunagun and Devil Survivor 2)\r\nThe thing is the sequel did not solve any problems the Fairy Tail has. It only got worse. Its still has bad story, bad characters, and bad writing and this was added by the horrible animation. Bridge is very inconsistent in animating. The firstepisode has exemplary animation but this was the opposite on the next episode. This is still continuing up to now. Some episodes have great visuals but some were not. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters did not change too. They were still bland and badly written. Natsu is still the same stupid protagonist with the powa of friendship. Unlike Gray and Erza, his character did not have the chance to develop. Most Fairy Tail characters are like that. This is dragging the story down. Their personalities actually is the cause of the repeatedness of the storyline. The resolve to protect their friends is actually the cause why the same thing happens over and over.\\n\\n\r\nEvery arc didn\u2019t change at all. It was still still like this:\\n\\n\r\nVillain appears \u21d2 Hurts some Fairy Tail members \u21d2 Natsu got angry \u21d2 Fairy Tail fight the villain \u21d2 Fairy Tail won either by some Deus ex Machina or Powa of Friendship\\n\\n\r\nAlmost all the arcs was like that. It became worse at the end of the Eclipse arc. The end of the Eclipse arc in the manga angered many people leading them to drop Fairy Tail. That end was a actual Deus ex Machina. And now another tedious filler arc is still airing in Fairy Tail 2014\\n\\n\r\nAs always Fairy Tail\u2019s music is still amazing. Still has the same composer. Fairy Tail\u2019s iconic soundtrack change a bit but nevertheless still amazing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Fairy Tail (2014) failed to solve the problems its facing and only got worse. But nevertheless I will not drop this for the reason this is my gateway anime and I want to see it ending with my own eyes and see how they animate Tartarus arc\\n",

            "content": "This is a 100% spoiler free review of  Fairy Tail (2014) the sequel to Fairy Tail - An anime that  I thoroughly enjoyed watching for 175 episodes and consider as one of my favorite anime.\r\nI know what you are probably thinking,\"there's already dozens of low rated reviews for this anime, despite it having such a high MAL rating; how is this not just another troll review by a typical fairy tail hater.\" So I would like to clarify that this is a 100% serious review with no hate specifically towards Fairy Tail or the shounen genre.\r\nSo if you have not seen either FairyTail or Fairy tail(2014) then you are probably sitting down with a puzzled look on your face wondering why anyone would give a continuation of one of their favorite anime such a low rating.\\n\r\nThe answer is pretty simple; this is not the anime that I fell in love with, it is not the anime that i spent over 50 hours watching and it certainly isn't an anime I would recommend to my friends or to the members of MAL. It is just a poor sequel to a popular anime; with drastic quality reductions and sub-par animation to milk more money from it's targeted audience.\\n\\n\r\nStory + Fights : 4/10\\n\r\nSince this review is a continuation for Fairy Tail i presume you already know the basic plot and most likely consider the Grand Magic Games arc that ended halfway in the original was one of the best arcs in Fairy Tail, and are eagerly waiting to carry on.\\n\r\nThis is where I would like to state my opinion - Yes, the grand magic games arc started off amazing, but it honestly isn't worth carrying on. \\n\r\nIn Fairy Tail 2014, the pacing of the fights is honestly dreadful. \\n\\n\r\nWe all got into Fairy Tail for the fast paced,action packed fights didn't we?\\n\\n\r\nWell there is no more of that anymore, instead you are forced to wait 5 episodes in the hopes of watching decent fight, only to realize that it lasts for mere minutes being switched to a different fight which u clearly don't have any interest in, or some characters talking about some plot which is clearly not important  and  only exists so that the anime can drag a fight for 4 episodes longer than is should be.\\n\r\nHonestly Natsu vs Sting and Rogue in the original Fairy Tail is 100x better than fight there will ever be in the second season. Do yourselves a favor and savor this fight as your last Fairy Tail memory otherwise you will regret ruining your views on such an enjoyable series.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation + Art : 2/10\\n\r\nThis is very much my biggest problem with Fairy Tail 2014, remember the epic battles with amazing animation and colorful abilities. Well that isn't the case anymore in Fairy Tail 2014; instead you should expect clunky character movement and animation, incorrect and totally absurd body proportions - I am not even joking sometimes you will notice characters half the size of the rest of the cast, and other times you will see characters with the tiniest heads and smallest bodies. But the thing that completely dwindled my faith in the animation for the Fairy Tail 2014 is the fights; it seems as if  half the battle seems to be cut out of the picture, the abilities used are half animated and the screen often shifts to the characters so the studio doesn't have to animate the rest of the ability, instead we see stupid crap; such as a zoom in on Natsu as his enemies are sent flying into the air, without us even seeing him remotely use his abilities. The new modern style that the studio tried to use in this production is clearly not working and greatly takes away from what we all loved about Fairy Tail.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\r\nThe one part of Fairy Tail that will always be amazing; the OP, the ED and the OST are still amazing, everyone already knows that the soundtracks to Fairy Tail are some of the best you will ever see, and this season is no disappointment in that regard, rarely will you find poor music in Fairy Tail and even in such a poor season it is still exceptional\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 5/10\\n\r\nThis sequel is nothing like the prequel; every single aspect of the show from animation to battles has taken a drastic drop in quality, and has gotten to the point where you are better off looking elsewhere for the shounen action you desire. Yes, you may have developed an attachment to the amazing cast of characters in Fairy Tail or the concept of magic and the wide array of intricate powers out there in Earthland but trust me when I say that even the exceptional music and sound in Fairy Tail won't save you from being disappointed in the downwards progression of all the other aspects of Fairy Tail.\\n\\n\r\nHowever you can still find some enjoyment in this series, it isn't complete trash and is still watchable, some of you may enjoy it, so don't let this review stop you! Decide for yourselves if you think that it will be worth it. Yet, I still do not recommend it.\\n",

Then I watched the opening of the new Fairy Tail 2014. I had realised something, the WHOLE fucking plot was spoiled in the opening. The fact that you get to see which characters battle one another and the fact that there is a dark silhouette in the shape of a dragonhas completely destroyed the potential of story development due to the fact that the plot line has already been told in the op.\\n\\n\r\nI also wanted to mention the distinctive and disgraceful animation in the new season.\\n\\n\r\nIn 2 words it would probably described as: Picture Drama.\\n\\n\r\nYou know when there is a special or an OVA for a really awesome anime you are reluctant to watch due to the fact that the entire episode is photos frame by frame? Yes, that is what Fairy Tail 2014 has become.\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, if the amazing soundtrack combined with the funny sense of humour is something you would enjoy, then I would suggest you watch this for only the comedic moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this has been a massive let-down from the first season and as an avid Fairy Tail fan I would suggest to read the manga instead of wasting your time on the anime.",

            "content": "EDITED: THIS REVIEW ENCOMPASSES THE WHOLE 102 EPISODES OF FAIRY TAIL (2014)\r\n*NOTE: Due to the nature of this series some comparisons between the new series and the original run will arise but generally this review is spoiler free.\r\n Fairy Tail (2014) was a highly anticipated sequel to the original run  of Fairy Tail which lasted from 2009 to 2013. Now the original anime wasn't anything special or groundbreaking by any means however it was an anime that managed to avoid the majority of the pitfalls associated with long running anime like Naruto, Bleach etc. Sure it had the 'plot convenient' power ups andthe 'power of friendship' cliches but it still managed ti garner a pretty huge and devout fan following. The main reasons were the fact that it had extremely consistent animation, brilliant soundtracks and very likable characters along with interesting arcs that didn't drag on and fights that were short and sweet. I confess that i was among that devout fan following and loved FT like it was the greatest anime ever (this was about 3 years ago mind you) so how is it that a fan like me is giving this sequel such a low score? Lets begin...\\n\\n\r\nStory: . The pacing of the story  is horribly inconsistent and extremely slow paced. There are some episode that will try to fit in a lot of content in the space of just one episode and others where there will be nothing of consequence done over the course of many episodes, a problem that arises from dragging out episodes is the extremely corny dialogue that is quite often cringe worthy. Now a typical aspect of shounens is 'hyping up' every battle and every showdown for eg Shokugeki no Souma does this excellently. Fairy tail tries but fails miserably at this not because of its inability to hype up sequences but because of the inability to follow up on it which leads to extremely boring battles and plot conclusions. Also many of the most interesting characters including Erza, Zeref, Jellal etc suffer deeply from a lack of screen time. Plot holes run rampant in this anime and character motivations are seldom explored. An example i would like to mention here form the series is the FT zero arc which animated 13 chapters in the space of almost 10 episodes, this is by no means helpful to the pacing of the series and means that episodes drag on aimlessly because of the little content that they get to adapt.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: As i mentioned before Fairy tail mainly drew me in because of its consistent animation however that is not the case any more. FT tries to experiment with a new animation style that resembles the manga but in colour it doesn't look quite as good. The biggest letdown in terms of animation is,  unlike the first series, inconsistency. BG are well drawn but during battles many characters look nothing more than doodles (naruto anyone?). Another problem is the extremely bland colour template, for some reason the colours are towards the  dark side and this does not fit the previous series' cheery looking vibrant colours. \\n\\n\r\nSound: This is hands down the best aspect of the anime. All of the OPs and EDs are very well done and continue the legacy of the original's brilliant soundtracks. Some tracks that have stuck with me are 'Masayume Chasing', 'Believe in myself' and 'Ashita wa Orase' all of which are eargasmic. The osts on the other hand are overused but still are acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Due to the inconsistent and slow nature of the story the characters don't really have a chance to shine like they did in the original. Many interesting character's like laxus, erza, gajeel, jellal etc are thrown into the background and only appear rarely. Their development has remained stagnant over the course of these 102 episodes. Many important moments from the manga that are important in fleshing out the characters were animated without any of the emotional drama and this means that character emotions look forced and overdramatic. Natsu is much the same and Lucy is still quite useless as a MC. Zeref is sorely missed and only appears in about 4 episodes despite the fact that he is the main antagonist. The rest of the antagonists are not nearly as interesting and their motivations are petty to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Probably the only reason that i have stuck with this anime for so long is the feeling of nostalgia i got every week i sat down and watched another episode, but nostalgia can only take you so long and at some point watching it became nothing more than a chore, devoid of enjoyment and the love that i once had for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI am honestly shocked at how such an amazing  anime has been ruined, it is now nothing more than a shadow if its past glory and is a prime example of how greedy studios can turn an interesting show into a shitty cash grab. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for taking the time out to read this long review and any feedback is greatly appreciated since this is my first review.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fairy Tail 2014 is the sequel to the original Fairy Tail anime that aired from 2009-2013. It's actually an upgrade in many ways from the previous anime despite having a shaky beginning with their budget it seems (Early episodes have varying quality throughout). Let's just be clear, this is still the same Fairy Tail everyone knows and loves. \r\nStory: I think a lot of the problems people have with the 2014 series is that the beginning of it is the second half of the Grand Magic Games (Which for whatever reason is the most critically panned non filler arc of the series, so it beingthe first arc affects people's ratings) and then it goes straight into a filler arc afterwards. I agree, it's unfortunate the sequel anime to the original Fairy Tail got shackled by 2 arcs in a row that \"most\" people didn't like (I actually loved the Grand Magic Games, but understand I'm in the minority). \\n\\n\r\nRecently however, the anime has been on track to reclaiming its former greatness. Adapting the popular sidestory omake chapters and starting the Tartarus (or Tarataros) arc have seen the budget and artwork increase, and storywise the series has never been better. This arc is pretty much the epitome of greatness concerning Hiro Mashima's writing. Each of the main cast members get something awesome to do in this arc, and it features some of the best plot twists in the series.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Even if the earlier episodes were filled with inconsistent artwork, the DVD releases actually fix up a lot of noticeable problems, so for the sake of my review I'll use those redone episodes as the basis and the current quality of the Tartarus arc. While the first anime made things too colorful and purposely avoided blood, Fairy Tail 2014 takes that darker step and makes the color palette closer to the original manga, and even adds blood into scenes! (There could be more blood though, but that's just a nitpick at best. It's still better the original Fairy Tail in that regard).\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound track for the series continues to be superb. While some of the original tracks from the first Fairy Tail do make reappearances as remixed versions of themselves, most of the OST in this series is brand new. The Tartarus arc especially has some great new darker themes (With demon chanting) that definitely sets the mood, on top of having the soul pumping kickass main theme when main characters kick ass.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Oh boy, where Fairy Tail has always shined is its cast of characters and the 2014 series is no exception. You have your main 5 cast members from the previous series returning: Natsu, Erza, Gray, Lucy, and Wendy. Then you have all the various side characters from their guild and all the other guilds. Every character gets a chance to shine, and it's hard to not have a favorite in a show where so many characters get ample amounts of screentime. Certain characters, like Gray, especially have seen some major development and focus in the 2014 series due to certain story sequences, more so than he did in the original Fairy Tail anime. \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Definitely love watching Fairy Tail each week with my friends and family. We have come a long way from getting still frames, magic circles, and reused battle animation to where we are now. I would even go as far to say that now the animated action clearly outshines the manga.  \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: In conclusion, I have to say that Fairy Tail 2014 has surpassed the old series in nearly every category. It really annoyed me that so many people were rating this series 4s and 5s based off just watching the first few episodes but not waiting to see how this adaptation would turn out. I'm hoping many people find my review helpful and that it encourages them to watch to at least the Tartarus arc to see if they'll like the new series or not. Fairy Tail 2014 gets a 10/10 overall.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Picking up where the series last left off, A-1 pictures adapts Hiro Mashima's Fairy Tail at the Magical Games Arc. Now before I can actually review it, a lot of my gripes with series stems from the one before it and it's not like it's two separate series of continuity. \r\nI didn't hate watching Fairy Tail at first. But the deeper I got into it, the more I felt it squandered all the potential it had at the start. In the end, I couldn't help but see it as the most generic shonen ever - it was as if the author ticked all the boxes(stupid male characters with predictable quirks, average-smart females of the needs-saving variety, power of friendship, fanservice, magic power systems, climbing-ranks-and-being-the-best goals, etc.) that are supposed to make a shonen series good, but failing to actually give arcs substance as a whole to make the world believable.\\n\\n\r\nWhile ever long running show has weaknesses, the others take their setting making most of their unique world and dilemmas. Fairy Tail on the other hand doesn't seem to be getting plot or character developments done. Yes, a few things do happen that seem to affect more than just that arc, but in the end, there isn't even a depth and it remains as shallow as ever.\\n\\n\r\nNOW, why did I keep watching? The first Fairy Tail's glorious osts and it was actually mindless entertainment for the most part. But now that they changed it, while I'm open to change, the music just doesn't mesh well with it. The show also tries too hard to make itself funny and the animation seems to have taken a turn for the worst. I might pick it up some time but I've dropped it for now.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it's okay-ish if you're brand new to the anime but Fairy Tail never brings anything new to the table that you've probably seen in other shows. If if you're thinking about watching this show, you're better off with another of the Big Three (One Piece, Naruto, and Bleach), Dragon Ball Z, or Hunter X Hunter.",

It should have been in the best. Any way lets get to the point.\r\nThis season comprise of 4 arcs although the last arc (10 episodes) are not that interesting because they go to way before past where fairy tail wasnt even borne yet still the other 3 arcs are full of action and entertainment. Its a total blast of shounen. Although i too believethat this season was not funny like the previous one but that was because this time they took a rather serious way to deal things as the troubles this time were greater than ever.\\n\r\nThe dialogues the feelers and the chills of excitement are filled in this season and the one thing that has advanced is the fighting style. It is superb this time not to say that it was not superb the previous time but this time it was on a far whole level.\\n\r\nSo i believe one should watch this anime regardless of the size because after watching it you will find your true self, you will start to believe in yourself and also a sense of  goodwill will be born within you regarding your loved ones. this anime will boost your courage and fill you with enthusiasm.\\n\\n\r\nthe only problem this anime had like always with all other fairy tail animation is poor execution of the animation fluidity, its not smooth, this hamperssome of the fun but ...\\n\\n\r\nOne should really watch this anime with full interest and i am sure you will enjoy it so best of luck with it. I hope you liked my review even though it seemed a little unrealistic.",

            "content": "Fairy Tail 2014 is the sequel to Fairy Tail starting off right where the other one left off, in the grand magic games arc. (Not going to go into detail about the story since most of those reading this will have already watched the first one) So Lucy a main female character is captured and now the gang has to go and bust her out of prison guns (magic) blazing right? Well, no. They sneak in to save her (Which is totally the smart thing to do) but right after they do they fall into a trap and now they have to escape the placeor die. There lies the problem with these first few episodes, they spend a lot of tine dragging things out with fan service and constantly switching back and forth between the grand magic games. \\n\\n\nThe early fights, (seeing as there are only 9 episodes out right now) are boring and don't give an intense feel like the first one does, (which I really enjoyed) all the fights this time either, drag out too long or doesn't even last for a good length of the episode (although do the the constant switching between fights the battles usually last an episode or 2). \\n\\n\nThe cast of characters didn't change and if you like how they were in Fairy Tail, you'll like em just as much in this one. All the characters though are pretty much just classic stereotypical shounen characters that we've all seen. The cast doesn't get much development (except for Ezra, Lucy, a little on Wendy, and a little on Gray.) seeing as Natsu is still the same bumbling idiot that attracts all sorts of trouble (probably my favorite character though.) The thing that really saves and stands out about these characters are their interactions.\\n\\n\nThe music is good, but the first opening is (arguably) worse than the first one.\\n\\n\nAlthough it's very early to be saying this, I personally like the first one better and didn't get as much enjoyment out of this one as I did in the first one. There are many better anime this spring season (my opinion) than Fairy Tail right now such as No Game No Life and Haikyuu. I believe that Fairy Tail 2014 was just too hyped or \"fanboys\" just gave Fairy Tail 2014 the scores it has just because it's back or they are blinded to the flaws and think IT'S THE BEST ANIME IN THE WORLD! (there are those who do genuinely believe that it deserves a 10 who are or are not \"fanboys\".) \\n\\n\nIt may seem like I'm hating on Fairy Tail but... okay I am hating on it a bit because of the crazy amount of 10s it has for almost no reason and being higher ranked than shows I believe to be far superior (such as No Game No Life, Kuroko no Basket, and Chihayafuru) but I am a fan and will be following it.",

            "content": "Since the anime adaptation of Fairy Tail began in 2009, the franchise has established itself as a moneymaking machine. In fact, it appears that it is well on its way to establishing itself among the likes of Naruto and One Piece as one of those series that just doesn't seem to have any end in sight.\r\nI was actually a fan of Fairy Tail during its initial run. Quirky characters, attractive designs, a lot of humor, it was just good fun. The story arcs were also, for the most part, pretty decent. There was character development and each episode kept me engaged. Unfortunately, now that FairyTail's renewed run is well underway, it seems that almost all of the original appeal has been lost.\\n\\n\r\nDespite picking up right in the middle of a story arc, I can't help but feel like the pacing has been turned down to a minimum. There are far too many episodes in which virtually nothing happens to advance the plot and leaves me feeling like I just wasted 20 minutes. In the currently ongoing Grand Magic Games arc, the plot feels bogged down by too many elements and its progression is hindered by the series' continuous attempts to juggle numerous battles/situations in one episode. The result is that we get a quick glimpse of each separate, but simultaneously occurring situation, bouncing back and forth, and the show ultimately takes far too long to reach key plot points. From what I recall, the show's initial run did not have such atrocious pacing issues.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation there is nothing new or improved here. It's essentially the same as it was when it last left off and budget constraints are painfully evident in almost every episode. You'd think such a popular show would be able to allocate more resources to animation, but I guess not. (For those of who watching for the fanservice, there's still plenty of that.)\\n\\n\r\nFunnily enough, perhaps the thing that I find the most lacking is the absence of the original Fairy Tail theme. I'm a big fan of it and I felt more than a little disappointed upon noticing that it had been omitted in the renewed run. The soundtrack just feels dull without it. On the bright side, though, both OPs so far have been excellent (although you know there's a problem when the OP is more exciting than the actual episode).\\n\\n\r\nAlthough its redeeming factors are few and far between, as long as new episodes continue to be made, people will keep watching, and the producers will keep making money. Of course, being based on a manga, it's unfair to place all the blame on the producers. Most of Fairy Tail's fundamental flaws can be chalked up to bad source material. I may keep watching just out of some curiosity about what happens next, but in all likelihood I will probably be dropping Fairy Tail sooner rather than later.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Since 2014 is over I think it's appropriate to write a short review of how I felt about Fairy Tail in 2014. I watched all of the Previous episodes so of course I had some expectations going into this season. \r\nAlmost none of those expectations were met.\r\nThe fight scenes are terrible and leave so much to be desired. The humor isn't funny anymore. The dialogue is cringe-worthy at times. Natsu has become a pansy. I haven't felt any satisfaction from anything that has happened so far this season. \r\nOverall Fairy Tail feels like it has become exclusively an anime for children and young teens. Butthen there's the raunchy fan-service and Lucy getting naked for no good reason so that probably isn't the case. After some censoring it's one of those shows I'd expect to be on Disney XD on Saturday mornings. It's like a 4Kids dub and it hasn't even been dubbed yet.\\n\\n\r\nIt suffers from the biggest case of \"main character gets his ass kicked and somehow pulls through at the end with the power of friendship\" that I've ever seen. And if you've watched Fairy Tail since the beginning you know it's always been suffering from this. It really feels like they sacrificed Natsu's awesomeness for the sake of hilarity (Natsu gets beaten around by low-tier enemies and screams wildly while it happens) except it isn't funny. Remember how epic it was when Natsu finally got serious and had that look in his eyes like nothing better stand in his way? Yeh, none of that happens either.\\n\\n\r\nEverything that happens is completely predictable 5 minutes before it happens. This isn't an exaggeration. Fairy Tail is riddled with so many tropes it's like the writers went to TVtropes and said \"yeh this looks good, let's put this in the show.\" Everything follows the same tired formula over and over and over. \\n\\n\r\nOne good thing that remains is the music. Fairy Tail always had great music that was unlike any other show out there. Also, many people aren't too fond of the new art but I think it's a step up from the previous seasons. Maybe that's just me.\\n\\n\r\nSo maybe Fairy Tail is going through a slump and it'll make me eat my words this year. I really hope that's the case. But as far as 2014 goes, Fairy Tail was forgettable and almost laughable.",

            "content": "Fairy tails climatic peak at the end of first series left a sweet taste in the mouths in some people returning for the second season, and left others with the kind which isn't so nice. There have been many revamps from animation to soundtrack, but don't worry, it still keeps its story as shallow as a puddle in the Sahara (basically it's non existent).\r\nThe story directly connects season 1 to season 2, and continues from the current grand magic games, where Natsu and fairy tail come up against other guilds for the crown of the best in Fiore. Problems arise, and fairy tail are ina race against time for more reasons than one.\\n\\n\r\nDon't worry folks, it may have changed its image, but this shounen story sticks at what it does best, bad writing disguised as \"epic, brilliant, wowza!\". Fairy tails usual pacing is very rushed due to it's build up to arcs and fights described in simple terms with little or no thought of tactics or strategy. Furthermore, the atmosphere exudes a lack of seriousness, due to comedy being introduced at the wrong time. This eventually leads to emotional events and fights to not be taken seriously enough, because care and attention to detail is skipped for a quick thrill. It's also a \"the strongest fighter wins\" storyline and is concluded with short fights that have a rinsed and repeated story line, where random power ups occur and no real explanation is given as to how fairy tail truly win. This is where the dues ex machina comes in, as Fairy tail will be in a hopeless position to winning a fight in seconds. Unfortunately, this formula still exists. This eventually leads to Fairy tail frustratingly becoming more and more predictable in its fights and story line as time goes on. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of this, there's something about fairy which can easily let's you give into the childish, cheesy jokes once in a while. You can find yourself almost getting swept up in its hype sometimes, as it is shounen after all. Then again, bad writing eventually acts as the nail in the coffin for fairy tail.\\n\\n\r\nThe second major revamp clearly seen by Fairy tail 2 is the animation. Everyone's loving characters from Natsu to Laxus have all had a good wipe down, and are looking pretty neat. The designs are much more sharper, and this has had a direct impact on the fan service too, with every bussom being as big as before. Unfortunately further evidence of frame rate drops make another shameful comeback, which is surprising and ridiculous coming from a very recent anime.\\n\\n\r\nWith characters however, we still have the same, rememberable cast, with Natsu, Lucy, Erza and Gray still battling it out for the guild. The characters are very much the shounen stereotypes, Natsu the tough guy, Lucy the damsel who constantly tries to prove her worth all the time, Erza the overpowered typhoon ect. But only a few drops of character development reach some of these characters like Gray and Erza. This equates to each character never really changing after certain events. In the end, it's almost as if they have a limited set of phrases or ways to act because they are never changing. This is especially seen in Natsu, who hasn't changed from episode 1. To sum then up, the characters of fairy tail wholly offer very few rememberable moments, but will be rememberable for being a stereotypical cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe last overhaul comes from the music department, as a new series lead to a new soundtrack. The opening song unfortunately gave away spoilers, plus it wasn't very memorable. The OST however is top notch, it really does bring fights an extra essence of battle to them. The ending unfortunately catered to those whose life long dream it is to ship characters, not my thing.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Fairy Tail left me wanting to wash my mouth out. There are many flaws from the old season carried on into this season and nothing has been done to address them. In fact, it turns to glorify them instead. I would only recommend for those new to shounen anime, other than that, it's not worth your time.",

In a shounen battle anime.\r\nThis seemed a bit odd to me.\r\nThat isn't to say that the story and writing aren't fairly poor, of course. They rely upon the same clich\u00e9s in each arc. The writing is predictable and, hell, the characters even have catch-phrases.\r\nBut does any of that really matter for a shounen battle anime?\r\nI would say no. What matters most in abattle anime - especially one as lighthearted as Fairy Tail, - are the battles and the slapstick. It's dumb entertainment, to put it bluntly. But who watches such a thing and expects to be challenged mentally? That's like watching a horror and expecting romance and drama that makes you cry and feel along with the actors.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it I did not notice a major drop in quality between this series and the previous. The animation can be outstanding on some episodes and lazy on others. Only half of the characters have actually had a major amount of development but that development is noticeable and included in the writing.\\n\r\nThe sound design is also outstanding. Everything from the music to the VAs used. And on the whole it's just a fun series. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enter it with the knowledge that, yes, a shounen battle anime has clich\u00e9s out the arse and yes, it won't challenge you mentally then you're pretty much good to go. Fairy Tail is dumb feel-good entertainment. And it's pretty good at being what it is. Because sometimes it's nice to have something that isn't very serious.",

            "content": "A lot of people hate Fairy Tail. Despite the popularity, it's probably more hated than Sword Art Online and Boku no Pico, and that's saying something.\r\nI'm writing this review as fairly as possible. \r\nSTORY:\r\n The new series carried on from the previous (Grand Magic Games arc). Since the end of the arc, there were about five arcs (Eclipse Celestial Spirit Arc + omake, Sun Village Arc, Tartaros Arc, Tenrou Jade Arc and the first two episodes of Avatar Arc).\r\nDuring the one-year time skip within the series, we also saw Mavis' back-story in the Tenrou Jade Arc or Fairy Tail Zero as it's known to somepeople.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the manga and the omake manga. There was only one true filler arc throughout.\\n\\n\r\n The main disappointment is ending the series two episodes into a new arc.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\n The art was noticeably different, and was still bright and vivid - until the Sun Village Arc. During this arc and the following arcs, the animation colours seemed to gain a purple filter - that's the only way I can describe it, but it was around that time that the story no longer immersed me, because I was agitated with the new colours.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\n The soundtracks, oh my.\\n\r\n Acnologia could have been voiced by someone who knows how to truly sound badass.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\n The characters were more fleshed out during the omake.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\n I have to give this a lower rating than its predecessor. This is mostly down to the artwork involved. It's the main area that let down the series for me, to the point where it is no longer in my top 5 series.",

            "content": "Fairy Tail is one of those long-running series many ridicule, and I understand that. I see the flaws just as much as any outsider does. I get pissed off the characters' being overpowered without any reason or proof of having acquired them most of the time. The whole \"Friendship is magic\" is literally everything in Fairy Tail and it gets too fucking old. But, it is also because of that, that I fell in love with it. I love the concept of family and unity and shit like that. I'm a sucker for those things and Fairy Tail is all about that. Also, all theover-the-top revelations for this series have been really fucking awesome. I love the character interactions and the way they genuinely bond.\\n\\n\r\n You can't make me memorize the names of hundreds of characters but you don't need to force me to do that for FT. I know the Fairy Tail members by heart, because they are able to make you feel like you are part of their journey. Yes, FT has so many short-comings when it comes to the action and story-telling, but there is charm in this one that many people fall in love with which is why it is still popular to so many.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that these sort of long-running shounen series are not for everybody, and it's certainly not something you watch if you want to get deep shit from it. When watching such shows, you have to take it in raw and as light-hearted as possible. You don't need to think. You just have to watch the shit. No analyzing shit or so on, because you're only going to be wasting your time.\\n\\n\r\nTo end, I have enjoyed this immensely as I have already been a fan since before. This direct sequel has more or less the same elements and aspects as the previous one. Just more \"boom\" and more questions answered for some of the characters' unknown pasts. Try it if you will, and don't if you're not up for it. It's as simple as that.\\n",

It is very good and I wish more people would give it a try. \r\n-STORY- 10 - The story is very interesting, and while some people think it is very weak, I quite like it and think it is very unique.\r\n-ART- 10 - The art is quite outstanding, but I'm honestly not one to ask. It's pretty easy to see.\r\n- SOUND - 10 - Fairy Tail has some of the best soundtracks and music I've heard in any anime. IT has amazing openings (*COUGH* the first one *COUGH*), and has really good endings as well. \r\n- CHARACTERS -10 - Thisis another many people say are weak. Many dislike the some of the main characters, I even dislike a few characters in this show, but they are still amazing! Almost every character has their own respective back story, (unfortunately they are almost all sad, if not all of them) but they are all very interesting in their own way, and they are all powerful in their own way. \\n\\n\r\n- ENJOYMENT - 10 - I enjoy this anime a lot, and enjoy all of it, from the epic fights to the sad back stories, it is amazing. I just have to warn you, it has very heavy fan service, but don't let that stop you! :)",

(but thats just my opinion) \\n\\n\r\nthere are some more minor things about this anime... but the point is... it's too predictable... and i think is so overrated. but let me just say this again.. this is all my opinion. i dont expect everyone to agree with me. i know a lot will disagree.. but it's just my opinion. and i think that if, like me, you are more into anime that is serious and goes pretty deep ( the plot) then you most likely will not like this anime. but if youre new to anime, or if u just want to watch some hyper anime( just for fun) with fan service, or if u dont like anime with a deep plot...  then yeah.. you'll probably like this anime... or you can probably give it a go and see. \\n\\n\r\ni dont know if what i said actually looks like a review..  but... yeah...  it is my first time... and it is just my opinion.... and im not saying that fairy tail is a terrible anime ( okay maybe i think it is) but still, i know that there are many people that enjoy it....",

So ummm I guess I should start at how the action scenes here aren't awesome as they use to be during the last seasons boring fights takes longer this and the awesome ones takes like a few minutes of the episode. I'm still not over how they don't actually add blood but just stain them in clothes or hands. I'm expecting more from this. We have several episodes to come so I'm hoping something can be more improved here .I'm digging the new style too but I also miss the old style.\r\nArt 8/10: Ilike it and the high quality it gives but I'm just so used to the old style and I feel like it's better but this one is like the one in the movie well a little bit .\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10: Seriously, the story is really unique about a huge gate linking the past and future and dragons. The strongest wizard being someone of darkness.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: Lucy became like a model for fan services in the past episodes. Where the heck are the other characters like Gildarts?! Man , where does that guy even go\\n\\n\r\nBut despite some flaws I enjoy really much and that I'm happy watching it or rewatching it or ok ok ok fine I'm done x'D",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nTime to look at a steaming #2. Fairy Tail 2! Despite the fact that I had a LOT of problems with the first Fairy Tale series, I honestly thought that Fairy Tail still had some potential. Fairy Tail had an excellent animation budget, a large cast of characters of whom at least a couple were interesting, and a solid soundtrack. Under a capable director and with a few tweaks and changes, perhaps Fairy Tail could have become a top tier shonen anime. After all, the first Hunter X Hunter series was garbage, but a slightly better budget and a few tweaks and BAM! all thenew anime fans think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread!\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, not only is Fairy Tail 2 NOT a vast improvement over the first Fairy Tail, it is almost universally considered worse. Why? There are several reasons, which I will explain and break down.\\n\\n\r\n1. Plot: When a shonen series goes on for a few years and fans that got into the series as age 12-13 start to grow up, there are 3 things you can do. The first is to pull a Pokemon and keep rebooting the series so old fans leave and new fans keep coming. The second is to pull a Naruto/Dragonball and try make the series darker and more action oriented to fit the tastes of a maturing audience. The third is to not do anything different, but have the title \"One Piece\". Fairy Tail 2 tries to pull a One Piece and not do anything different and expect audiences to keep buying it. The difference is that Fairy Tail has never had the same level of quirky comedy that One Piece does and it isn't quite as creative. Instead, Fairy Tail took a highly formulaic plot that was already beaten to death and decided to simply beat it further to death! The whole series fills like filler at this point, even when it isn't. NOTHING happens to change the status quo or challenge the viewer with a new and truly engaging plot. \\n\\n\r\n2. Characters:\\n\r\nThe main characters: Natsu, Lucy, Grey, and Happy are still just as obnoxious and generic as ever. No effort has been put into developing their characters or making them even slightly more likeable. Erza has received at least a little character development from the beginning and is by FAR the most likeable character so...why isn't she the main character again? The greatest thing that could happen to Fairy Tail would be killing off the 3 main characters with horrible, painful deaths and replacing them with characters like Erza, Laxus, and Mirajane. The supposed reason for not doing this is that having a team of just badasses would wear thin and they would be less special if you saw them all the time. However, other anime like Yu Yu Hakusho managed to pull it off. Even if the series needed to be shorter, so be it! I would MUCH rather have a short series with awesome characters than a neverending series with shitty characters. Too bad Fairy Tail is all about running as long as possible to make as much money as possible, rather than actually giving a shit about quality!\\n\\n\r\n3. Art:\\n\\n\r\nThe art studio has changed between series and unfortunately not for the better. Anime should gradually look better each year just like Hollywood CGI gets slightly better every year. Fairy Tail 2014 looks shittier than the first Fairy Tail did in 2009! Maybe budget issues are to blame, but Fairy Tail is a highly successful series financially and that doesn't seem too likely. I honestly suspect that the studio just wanted to spend less on art and take in more cash. Unfortunately, Fairy Tail wouldn't be the first anime series guilty of simply not giving a FUCK about its own fanbase.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI currently have this series \"on hold\". If something drastic happens and there is ever a reason to watch it again, I might give it a shot. As long as the series is desperately trying to maintain the status quo and wallow in its own  mediocrity I will be staying far away from this underachieving waste of time.",

            "content": "Unlike most people here, I actually enjoy Fairy Tail quite a bit.\r\nSo the story starts off with Lucy trying to buy a key from an old man, and I wasn't expecting it to be the action-packed show my friend told me about. But I continued to watch it, and whenever it got to the port scene, I instantly fell in love with the anime.\r\nIf you read the manga, the drawing style is a little different than the beginning of the mamga, by the way.\r\nI believe that it has decent character development, although it does not seem to be a major aspect of the story. Throughoutthe story, Natsu doesn't change a but, and that really irks me.  The character development or change of any kind mainly happens with the antagonists.\\n\\n\r\nSo, 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style is pretty awesome! The fight scenes are well drawn/animated. Buuuuut them they had the break, and started back up last April. The animation changed quite a bit. The colors are duller, and it has that weird thing were you can see the shape of the eyes through the hair. The fight scenes are just as good, though.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fantastic! The openings and endings  are amazing, and so are the various themes played throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! Even though it conflicts with most other reviewers' reviews. \\n\\n\r\nJa Ne!",

            "content": "I decided to write this review as there are many negative reviews of this anime I do not think it's fair.\r\nFairy Tail is a Shounen manga, says it all: SHOUNEN, it's nothing complex (of course it is.), Is a protagonist who is very Over Power that does not lose to anyone.\r\nShounen manga which the protagonist loses? It's hard to see\r\nI was happy with the return of the same in 2014 even as the battle of the big games could not end at the apex that was. I began to read the manga so anxious to see the development of that arc, but only read tothe end of the arc of dragons, because I was hoping the return of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime came back and I watched with all the excitement that could, over thearc and started a gigantic arc filler I honestly did not watch even the first episode, I left the anime on hold, because I do not have much time to lose now day, after the end of filler arc and I waited to accumulate, had a 20 canonical episodes, I began to watch these last three or four days and ended.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'll follow every week because I look forward and know nothing of the story because I have not read manga and do not try spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nIf you watched Fairy Tail, you can watch the sequel which will not regret, I will not stop watching an anime because it has a fanservice here, one there ecchi, I like the characters, the story, I like Fairy Tail.",

            "content": "i will keep this review as simple as i possible can. because it does not deserve a complicated review. (Yet it ended up pretty long -.- XD)\r\nTo keep it short. Fairy tail (2014) Sucks.\r\nWhy does it suck?\r\nStory: i dont know what the F happened with the story in Fairy tail (2014). its not there anymore. well the story was not there too much in the original Fairy tail either but there was a little presence of it. however in Fairy tail (2014) its not there. \r\nFanservice:\r\nAnd dont get me started started on the fanservice. dont get me wrong but i like fanservice and i seeno wrong in using it. but Fairy tail just uses it on the battles that already are short enough to make you cry. some characters are even useless i will even call them dead weight. i will be blunt... Lucy is just there ONLY for the purpose of Fanservice even though she is the main female protagonist. she is a cry baby, super weak and is only used for Fanservice (pretty much a stripper xD). i would be happy actually if they just killed her off but ofc that wont happen.\\n\\n\r\nBattles: i really liked the battles of the original fairy tail. it was one of the things that made me keep watching fairy tail. However in Fairy tail 2014 i wish they never added the battles (that is if you can call them battles at all). what i mean is that The battle begins they fight for 5 secs talk for like 2.5 mins or more and suddenly they change scene to some other battle and this keeps going for all the battles. and im going like WTF LET ME WATCH THE BATTLES THAT DRAWES ME TO FAIRY TAIL! but no no no they dont do that anymore.\\n\\n\r\nCliche (Story + Battles):\\n\r\nThis anime is all about Cliches has always been about Cliches. they have over used the nakama power up thing. and they just wont stop using it. it is just annoying at this point no actually annoying is to generous of a word to explain the over used cliches in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNot much to say. been a lite change but you know meh.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development (Story)\\n\r\nPretty much none what so ever. all we have gotten so far from Natsu is that Natsu had a dragon as a parent. And the History/past of Erza and Gray (which was in the original Fairy tail not Fairy tail 2014). AND THAT IS IN 211 EPISODES (Fairy tail + Fairy tail 2014) im sitting here like -.- while rubbing my temples when i see the number of episodes and pretty much the none existent character Development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nBecuase of the downgrade in pretty much all the aspects of the anime i have so far had no Enjoyment of the anime what so ever. and i probably will never enjoy Fairy tail ever again. i want to give it a 0 but 1 (Pathetic) is the lowest rating i can give.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is very good i like the sound but. no matter what they do with the sound at this point the anime will probably not get any better (because of sound ofc.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nJust a big fat NO. if you have watched the original fairy tail. leave it at that DO NOT watch this anime not even if you are bored without any animes to watch. Just find something else to watch.",

            "content": "Gather around ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to tell you a story.\r\nBack when the first Fairy Tail series was still airing, I watched it every week. It was one of the shows I looked forward to most. It was my favorite shounen, it had good action, great arcs, fun characters, everything that I wanted in an ongoing anime. It had its flaws, yes, but it was still enjoyable to watch none the less. When I found out that the first series would be ending, I was upset. I'd have to wait a long time to watch another episode of what I thought was an awesomeanime. Luckily, unlike some other shows, the wait took less than a year before the second series started airing, and like the true fan I was, I began watching it every week.\\n\\n\r\nIt's been over 6 months now, and in that time, I slowly began watching it less and less, up to the point of me writing this review where I am about 5 weeks behind. It's not because I've been busy, or I've found other anime I've wanted to watch, no. The reason behind this is because of the fact that Fairy Tail has changed for the worse.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is one of the few qualities that Fairy Tail (2014) has going for it. The series begins right where the first series left off: during the Grand Magic Games. It's like it never actually went on hiatus, it just picked right back up like nothing happened. It continues down it's normal Arc to Filler to Arc path, just like the first Fairy Tail series, or any other shounen anime for that matter. However, in my personal opinion, the arcs that I've watched so far weren't as entertaining as I was hoping they'd be. People say that the arc that they'll be getting into will be long and amazing, but until then, Fairy Tail series 1 still holds first place in terms of story.\\n\\n\r\nNow we get into where the show took a turn. In the first series, Studio Satelight and A-1 Pictures were co-producting Fairy Tail together. The art style was smooth, detailed and had really good visuals. And then, A-1 Pictures took over. From there, the animation went from grade A to... that of a detailed flash animation. The magic I saw in the original art was gone, and was replaced with average, if not below average, animation. The characters look different, there doesn't seem to be as much movement between characters as they speak or run, it was a let down. At first I thought I wouldn't mind the change in animation, but after a while it really got to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire cast of Fairy Tail series 1 is back, meaning there aren't any characters that either hit puberty all of a sudden or got punched so hard their voice changed permanently. Tetsuya Kakihara nails his role as Natsu as he did before, along with others like Rie Kugimiya, Yuuichi Nakamura, Aya Hirano, Satomi Sato, and Sayaka Ohara. What I loved about the sounds and everything the most were the Openings and Closings. So far, I can say that I still like them. The music in all of them is catchy as hell.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the series are more or less the same. They all have the same personalities, same magic, the whole shebang. This is what I'm most glad to see stayed the same. Occasionally, in a second season/second series/new adaption/timeskip, there will be some major changes in this department. Sometimes it will be because the characters grew up, like Simon in Gurren Lagaan, but other times, the characters will have completely different views on everything around them for no reason. If Fairy Tail (2014) went down this road, I would have most likely stopped watching sooner rather than later. Thankfully this was not the case.\\n\\n\r\nDo I enjoy Fairy Tail (2014)? Yes and no, but for the most part I'm leaning towards no. Do I think it's better than Fairy Tail series 1? Definitely no. Do I think that it might pick up at some point? Yes. As I said before, some upcoming arcs in Fairy Tail might help it regain what enjoyment it got from me.\\n\\n\r\nMy conclusion: even though Fairy Tail (2014) is upsetting due to the fact that it isn't as good as series 1, I will continue to watch it. I've loved Fairy Tail for years, and I'd feel bad dropping out after getting this far. But who knows? Maybe it'll pick back up.",

            "content": "Did you ever have that show that you loved as kid but as you grew older you start to dislike most of the shows that you grew up with?  For me there were a couple of cases of this. One of the best examples was in Yugioh GX where I use to absolutely loved the show as a kid for its amazing duels, funny and likeable character and enjoyable arcs. Sadly as I got sadly older and I decided to re-watch the show when I was 15 years old I started to not like the show as much as I did thanks to itsmessy pacing, mediocre characters and subpar arcs that are mostly contrived. I don\u2019t hate Yugioh GX or anything but rather not re-watch it again because I would end up hating it. This can also have the opposite effect for example I use to dislike Cardcaptor Sakura when I was a kid but as I grew older I started to loved them due to the fact that not only I was watching the uncut version of the show but the story, characters, visuals and music were amazing to a point where it became one of my favourite animes.\\n\r\nSo how does his any of this relate to Fairy Tail. Well my first encounter of Fairy Tail was in 2009 at age 11 and this was the time where I slowly taking a break of watching anime because around that time I was more of a gamer than a anime fan however Fairy Tail was one of the few shows that I decided to watched around that time. When I was 11 years old I loved it because my 11 year old self that Fairy Tail was amazingly written filled with complex characters, and well animated fights. Obviously I would cringe at my 11 year old self today but the one thing that you should remember that we were all kids back then and we didn\u2019t know what anime was good or bad as we just enjoyed anything that was shown to us on TV or in the net. \\n\r\nHowever as I grew older and started to watch anime more often again over the course of 2011- present I started to know what show was good or bad. I eventually re-watched Fairy Tail back in 2017 and I was shocked of how much I didn\u2019t enjoyed it. In fact I really started to really dislike Fairy Tail as a whole thanks to its countless problems that I will mention throughout this review.\\n\r\nNow I have no problem with anyone who likes Fairly Tail because compare to the likes of The King\u2019s Game, Big Order, Future Dairy and Eromanga Sensei where I questioned people for liking it thanks to its horrendous portrayal  of disturbing content  I can understand the appeal and charm of Fairy Tail. Half of my friends liked the series there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. This review is just me explaining why I dislike this series as well all the flaws in it. \\n\r\nNow with all that said hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and I will be reviewing Fairy Tail 2009 and 2014 and with that further ado let's begin.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nFairy Tail is set in Earth-land Asu Rando. A fictional world populated by wizards that coalesce into guilds to apply their magical abilities for paid job requests. The story follows a young novice wizard girl named Lucy Heartfilia who runs away from her home to join Fairy Tail a guild famous for its member's overly destructive antics. She meets soon meets a dragon slayer named Natsu Dragneel who travels to the kingdom of Fiore. Natsu invites Lucy to the Fairy Tail guild and she meets up with other Fairy Tail members. Soon Lucy forms a team with Natsu, his cat-like companion, Happy as well two others who join the team later Gary and Erza.\\n\r\nTogether they embark on numerous guild missions including subjugating criminals, illegal dark guilds, and ancient etherious demons created by the immortal dark wizard Zeref.\\n\r\nThe story is awful. Seriously this one of the worst stories that have ever seen in my life and now am going to tell why the story of fairy Tail sucks starting with the story structure.\\n\r\nThe story structure/ formula for Fairy Tail is honestly no different from watching a Saturday morning cartoon on TV in terms how it\u2019s structured and written.  \\n\r\nThis is the story arc structure of Fairy Tail.\\n\r\n1.\tPresent the problem to the cast.\\n\r\n2.\tThey travel to set destination\\n\r\n3.\tMeets the villains and so they can get they ass kicked by them  \\n\r\n4.\tFind the way to save the world from set villain\\n\r\n5.\tThey go on quest\\n\r\n6.\tThey split up so they can fight they appropriate matchups against the side villains for set arc\\n\r\n7.\tHave Natsu have power up so he can defeat the boss villain of the arc \\n\r\n8.\tRepeat Step 1 to 7 again until you GO insane!!!\\n\r\nDo you guys see a problem here? If this only happened in the first two arcs I this wouldn\u2019t that much but the problem is that the same story arc structure over and over again through the course of 277 episodes of misery.\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t help the fact that these so-called arcs in this show get worst at times goes on to a point where even the fourth great ninja war arc was much better written than the likes of Grand Magic Games and Tartaros arcs where the show just becomes a fan fiction mess with constant ass pulls just to piss off the viewer. The writing in Fairy Tail is shit. Almost every single arc including the god awful fillers arc is plagued with plot contrivances that will drive anyone inducing shounen fans mad. It doesn\u2019t help that the directing for almost every single arc is just abysmal beyond repair. Add this up with the shows shitty pacing, horrendous world building, a lack of stakes due to death fakeouts, doggy directing and the show doesn\u2019t really progress than you got one hell of a shitty story in your hands.\\n\r\nThis is one of the worst told stories I have ever seen in my life and it makes SAO look like it was done by William Shakespeare.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe character in Fairy Tail aren't much better in fact in many cases they are actually worse than the story itself.\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start the elephant in the room aka the worst character in Fairy Tail Natsu.\\n\r\nFrom start to finish I absolutely hated Natsu because not only he\u2019s was such a cardboard cutout with no personality but he was just an overpowered Gary-Sue who preaches about friendships. It doesn\u2019t help the fact is by episode 277 he is still the same character that we know from episode 1. Also unlike Gon from Hunter X Hunter he doesn\u2019t even try to look for his long-lost father. He\u2019s just spends his time one-shotting villains as well messing around in the guild. Natsu is the epitome of everything that could go wrong in a shounen protagonist and I hope that shounen writers will never attempt to recreate a character like that ever again.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly hated Lucy as a character. While not as much as Natsu she still got on my nerves quickly. She\u2019s is mostly useless in combat, she whines a lot and she\u2019s overall a damsel in distress where she\u2019s almost has to be saved by other characters like Natsu, Gray and Erza. It doesn\u2019t help the fact that she doesn\u2019t get much stronger as the series goes on.\\n\r\nGray is easily one of the most pointless rival type characters I have ever seen in anime. All he does is being bland on screen who likes to strip a lot as well having a rivalry with Natsu. Nothing more to say about Gray but he such an annoying pointless rival character.\\n\r\nErza was a decent character at first as she was very strong at combat as well being a good role model of the Fairy Tail guild. I also like her personality and character interactions towards other characters. However after a certain point of the series everything about Erza takes a turn for the worst and by the time you get to X791 parts she devolves into a preachy, overpowered, unlikeable mary sue who ass-pulls a lot.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters in Fairy Tail minus Mirajane, Laxus and Gajeel who are decent are just moving bodies on screen who are very forgetful. \\n\r\nThe same thing can be said for villains because all of them minus Jellal are just horrendously written villains that have no motivations and they are just forgetful fools in screen.\\n\r\nOverall other than, Mirajane, Jellal, Laxus and Gajeel the charterer in Fairy Tail were all horrendous. They were very bland, poorly written and downright annoying. This is easily no contest one of the worst character cast I have ever seen in any anime.\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nI honestly have almost nothing positive to say about the show visuals overall.\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the art which is honestly below average at best.\\n\r\nThe background scenery is just bland and feels lifeless. \\n\r\nThe female characters designs are almost as bad as the character designs from a Hirai Hisashi show (Gundam Seed) where if you talk out the hair colour, clothing and eye colour you will start to see how very similar the female character in terms of character design.  As for the male characters designs the main cast ones are okay but the more minor characters ones are horrendous beyond belief.  Also did I forget that the show constantly goes off model resulting in art-failures it goes worse in the 2014 anime where stopped giving a damm about art consistently where there\u2019s always a character going off model every 2 to 5 minutes.\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me started with the fan service cringe in this show because god this show is filled with unnecessary fan-service that insults the viewers intelligence.\\n\r\nAs for the animation itself it\u2019s honestly pretty bad because almost every single fight in the show is a freaking slide show filled with stiff movement and shitty fight choreography that will make anyone cringe. Throughout this 277 episode journey there was not a single fight that that I can was well animated due to the fact this show was so lazily animated to a point where shows from the late 80s and 90s had better animation than Fairy Tail. \\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me started with the actual animation of Fairy Tail 2014 because the animation of that show is a dumpster fire of shit filled with fights the feel like PowerPoint Presentations. \\n\r\nOverall the visuals in Fairy Tail are a joke that features some of the worst animation and art I have ever seen in a shounen anime.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack.\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one good thing about Fairy Tail it would be the soundtrack. The soundtrack of Fairy Tail is mostly consists upbeat tracks that perfectly captures the tone and setting for Fairy Tail however it does have its powerful and emotional tracks. \\n\r\nHowever I cannot say the same thing about sound effects because as they are not only Fairly Tail stole sound effects from other anime but they made theses stolen sound effects cringe-worthy to listen. Everytime I hear that \u201cWOW\u201d sound effect from the show I just cringe endlessly due to how annoying it sounds.\\n\r\nAll the opening and ending themes in are pretty catch in they own ways and they were all enjoyable to listen.\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\r\nBoth sub are dub are decent overall as everyone did a solid job in the respective languages. I personally prefer the dub for this one thanks to great performance voice actors such as Colleen Clinkenbeard as Erza, Monica Rial as Mirajane, Patrick Seitz as Laxus\\n\r\nIn short the music and voice acting in Fairy Tail is great and it was easily the best thing about this series. \\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nFairy Tail is best example of how to not write, direct and animate a shounen. The story was awful that is filled with plot contrivances, poor pacing, repetitive story arcs and dreadful writing. The characters were mostly god awful that have barely any charterer development as they like to asspull a lot. The visuals especially the 2014 anime were horrendous that contained a lot of art failures, poor fight choreography, horrible fan-service and lazy character design. The only few things that keep  Fairy Tail from being in the same tier as Eromanga Sensei, Victory Gundam, Black Bullet and Akame Ga Kill were the music, opening/ending themes and a few decent characters like Laxus, Mirajane, Gajeel and Jellal. Everything else was shit and made me wonder what exactly went wrong here. If this show was done by much more talented director and author then Fairly Tail would have been a great series but no instead this show was done by talentless hacks who don\u2019t know how to tell a story.\\n\r\nThere are honestly better anime shounen out there both old and new that are much better than Fairy Tail.\\n\r\nIf you liked or enjoyed Fairy Tail than good for you but for me Fairy Tail will forever be the worst long running anime that I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 3.5/10",

            "content": "There are many reasons why I'm giving Fairy Tail a score of 10. I'm not gonna go into too much detail because I don't want to be typing this all day. I'm just going to go into detail for each category it was ranked. Mind you this is for the anime not the manga I haven't read that far yet.\r\nStory: I gave this a 9 out of 10. The story in this series has been one of its biggest sellers for me. It originally started with Natsu looking for Igneel and so far it hasn't happened but there have been small and vague hints forwhat happened. Not only the whole plot with dragons but each arc is incredible. Tower of Heaven, Grand Magic Games, Tenrou Island just to name a few. At some point we will find out what happened to the dragons but for right now this show is keeping a lot of people entertained. Not to mention this show is finally having its first filler season since the show started. That's pretty impressive to go almost 200 episodes without having to jump into filler episodes.\\n\r\nArt: I also gave this a 9 as well. There are somethings that throw me off with the way the art is done in certain episodes, but either way the rest of it makes up for it. Especially the art during the Eclipse Gate arc. That was incredible every character looked full and complete and you can tell there was a good amount of detail involved with each character. The one thing I will admit I miss though is the magic circles when they did spells. BRING BACK THE MAGIC CIRCLES!!!!\\n\r\nSound: Another 9 here. Even though most of the themes and songs you hear are the main theme with different tempo or a slight variation in the beat it is still very well done. Some of the music for the fights that happen in the series are fantastic for example the Fire Dragon vs Flame God theme is absolutely amazing and gets you into the fight just as much as the characters are! The OP and ED themes are just as good throughout the series. When this show came back in April the first song Masayume Chasing was incredible not just because it was a great song, but it marked the return of a series that millions of fans have been waiting for. Then the fabulous band Back-On had another incredible OP theme for this series, and now the newest theme Break Out by V6 is just as good. The only reason I gave this a 9 and not a 10 is because of the fact that it just re-uses themes with the slight variation in it(mentioned above)\\n\r\nCharacters: This definitely gets a 10 from me. Most anime with this many characters have several of them just become just background fillers you don't know who they are or where they came from. Fairy Tail does the complete opposite of this. You know about every single character in the guild. From the lazy Nab all the way to Macao. You learn every characters backstory whether or not it is a quick flashback or a whole episode you get to learn about every single person in the guild and outside of it. Natsu and Gray and Erza are my favorite characters in this series. When I learned of Erza's backstory, I immediately loved her. All the things that she has been through and still able to stand tall is one of the best things about her. Gray is just as good from learning about his past and Deliora, even learning the reasoning on why he is always taking his clothes off! Most shows these days wouldn't care twice to go into the reasoning behind something like this. Last but not least Natsu, this guy is incredibly well written sure he occasionally gets his friendship power ups but there are other times where that guy refuses to stay down no matter what happens. The way they showed how he had to learn the concept of fear and know when to back down was huge. Prior to that happening he never put out those flames of his, after that he now knows that fear is just as important as courage. He is incredibly funny especially with Happy and the random tangents they go on about nothing. As a kid growing up I watched a lot of DBZ and obviously Goku was one of the best characters there because he was always getting stronger. Now I'm not saying Natsu is stronger than he is but I am definitely say that he develops around the same pace as Goku does which is something that I haven't seen from other characters in other anime that I have watched. Wendy and Gajeel get honorary mentions as well.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This gets a flat out 10. There is Magic and so many different kinds of it. I love seeing magic and different ways shows portray it. The way Fairy Tail does it is incredible. Going from something like Script magic up to Devil Slayer magic is insane. Each arc has been able to keep my interest so far which is something I can say that has not happened when I have watched other so called \"better\" shows. Eventually Natsu and friends will meet their dragons and once that happens who knows where the show will go from there!\\n\r\nOverall: 10 as long as this show keeps the pace it is going it will not drop lower than this! I've even gotten 4 people to start watching this show and one of them is almost caught up to me and they watched all 175 episodes starting from 49 in about 2 weeks. The rest are still around the 3rd season. The only reason they are watching the show is because it is held in incredibly high regard not only from me but millions of other fans around the world. The Fairy Tail fanbase is gradually getting bigger each day and as fans it is our job to spread the word about how great this show really is! The show is heading towards a big arc coming up this Spring and according to Hiro Mashima the Sun Village arc which is coming up soon was only the halfway point in the manga. It shows we have a lot more of this to come and I will definitely be going along on the ride so I can see where this show ends up. It is already in my top 5 anime of all time lets see if it can be at the top by the time this show is all said and done! \\n",

At one point the animation just seems to darken for some reason as if the show is getting dark and gritty, but its not and just doesn't make sense to screw over the brightness that you've been using for 1 series and half the current one.\r\nSound\r\nOpenings and Endings have always been great for Fairy Tail andare one of the things that still keep into the series. Voice acting isnt that great though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS DONT DIE IN THIS SHOW, IF THEY DIE THEY COME BACK TO LIFE!. I hate the characters in this show, I loved the main cast when the show started out. Natsu had a sad backstory with Lisanna, but she just came back into the series and I just realized that all the character development means shit if theyre gonna pull this off. Oh and by the way, all the chicks have big as boobs, not everyone is a horny kid.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThe show started off great when it came back in 2014 but the end of the continued arc from the previous season was just plain terrible and just shows that the author is getting lazy.

            "content": "Actually, I'm the type that likes reading reviews rather than writing them but I can't help myself and write my thoughts about FT 2014. I've read a lot of comments about it and realized almost nobody was content with this sequel. Please note that I'm not writing this review because I'm a huge fan or a hater. I like FT, like many other animes and I'd prefer the prequel for many reasons too but I really don't think this anime is getting the points it deserves.\r\nAnd this review has no spoilers.\r\nStory:\r\nContrary to common complaints, i really don't think the story changed drastically. Maybe after along wait for this sequel, watchers started realizing a lot of points about story only now because let's admit it, when we start watching an anime with a great potential like FT, we are willing to overlook a lot of things. Art and Sound have some impact on us realizing the problems with the story too, to some extent. But I admit that fights aren't what they were used to be (and i still think it's because of the studio, not the story), and I miss the old FT.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt just isn't like the prequel. This is a real downer for me, I really liked FT's art. It really fitted the ambience of FT. The art now though, is nothing like it. I can't find anything to say about other than it being carelessly drawn. Most obvious examples are the movements that look weird and body parts that doesn't look like they belong to the rest of the body. I really don't like the new art.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis is one of my problems too. I know I fell in love with the prequel's OST. I still get goosebumps when I listen to FT's OST (Main Theme for example). I find it epic but they didn't use it in the sequel. Imagine my frustration. I really, really miss the old OST. It was a great choice for the FT and drew you into the story too. Yeah, the sequel's OST is good too but it can never reach to the level of the prequel's. I like the OPs and EDs as usual though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCharacters didn't change in my opinion though I think some of them are set aside like never before. This may be because the current arc focused on some characters rather than others so I'll remain neutral about this and wait for new episodes or finish the manga to reach a conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nFT always gets me excited to watch. Maybe it's because I like the characters or surroundings or simply due to the nature of this anime. It has a lot of elements and they don't look out of place to me. They blend in with each other easily. I like wondering and getting impatient about the next episode, I like their personalities, bonds and strength. I still enjoy watching them do things with their nakama and succeed at the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI still think it's watchable though I admit it's not as good as the prequel. I don't think it's a major let down. This anime changed studios, yes, and lost some things but i can still get excited over it like before. This is why I give it a 7. I'm neither a fan nor a hater. I just like the series and wanted to give my honest opinion after I've read all those negative comments. I'll keep watching the anime and reading the manga. I say, give it a shot. If you don't mind the Art and Sound so much, you will like it and keep watching it after a few episodes of trying.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.: English is not my native language so there may be some errors. Sorry for those and enjoy!",

I've read complaints about the art and the story line, but I just don't see it, I sort of like it simplicity, your eyes are more drawn to the characters then to weird backgrounds or over exaggerated expressions. It's really difficult tofind a show with just the right amount of action, comedy, and a little Ecchi mixed in. Fairy Tail hits that mark perfect.",

The fights are not good or well written if you know the main character will ALWAYS win. \r\nAnother major problem with the show is that Hiro Mashima the writer of FairyTail puts too much emphasis on fan service that it takes from the the tension of the show. Seriously there have been fights with Natsu and it randomly cuts to a boob shot of Lucy randomly. And Erza ability essentially puts her into skimpy armor half the time and shes the best character in the show!  \\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail is a simple poorly written shonen, but what makes other shonen such as Full Metal Alchemist, HunterxHunter, and One Piece better, is the fact that the writer seems to care and respect their audience. As stated earlier Hiro Hashima writes sloppy plots and slips in fan service because he knows people will read it. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I do not recommend watching fairy tail, I do recommend staying indoors to watch better anime.",

            "content": "I've never really liked the shonen genre. It takes too long to get things done, it's infested with badly written fillers, and the art is usually not very good. Then I was persuaded to watch Fairy Tail (the old one), and surprisingly, it was fun to watch. It wasn\u2019t the best thing ever, but I managed to finish season one rather positive about it. There were some flaws, like the fact it became more and more repetitive as the show moved on,  and the characters were not getting any development. \r\nAnd then came the news of season 2 (2014), and there was a littlehope that the show would get a fresh start and maybe learn from its mistakes. If only\u2026\\n\\n\r\nStory; 4\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re reading this then I\u2019ll presume you\u2019ve already watched season 1, and therefore I will only briefly mention the \u2018main\u2019 story. A girl named Lucy joins a guild named Fairy Tail and goes on several quests with Gray, Erza, Wendy and Natsu. Natsu is a dragonslayer because he was raised by a dragon (huh) but he lost his dragon-dad at a very young age. He is now determined to find him. Too bad this concept has yet to make a big impact in the story. \\n\r\nIn Fairy Tail (2014) not much has changed. All the arcs revolve around an evil person or group doing evil sh*t and it\u2019s up to Fairy Tail to stop them. This means some skirmishes against weaker opponents, then a boss battle where they get there asses kicked, and then realizing how important friendship is and all of the sudden beating the opponent like it\u2019s nothing. Friendship is an important theme in shonen, but that won\u2019t save the show from becoming boring after they have done it in so many arcs, and show no intention to stop. It\u2019s like the creator has some kind of checklist where he has all the generic items for a shonen arc, and follows them strictly without even thinking to try something new for a time. This might change one day, but looking back on the first season I don\u2019t have much hope it will.\\n\\n\r\nArt; 3\\n\r\nThis new season was going to introduce the new art style and animation for the show, which was something I was kinda hyped about. The real reason you want to watch this kind of show are the battles, and what better way of making a battle more enjoyable than by animating it better, I though by myself. And there it was, the new art style. It looked okay, nothing to complain about. But then when more and more episodes came out it almost seemed as if the animation was even worse than the first season. It\u2019s a shame, because the new art style was decent enough to give the show a little boost, if it wasn\u2019t for the terrible animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound; 7\\n\r\nWhat didn\u2019t change in this new season was the guy that composed all the music for the first season. Yasuharu Takanashi proves again that he can make some kick-ass songs that fit well with the show. The staff didn\u2019t reuse any of the songs of the old Fairy Tail, so Takanashi needed to make a whole new set of Guitar/Folk tracks that would still feel like the old songs, and for accomplishing this, sound is the only point where Fairy Tail gets some praise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter; 3\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve made clear before, the creator is kinda scared to try something new with the story. Same goes with the characters. They started as your typical shonen stereotypes, and even now the show has been given a fresh start, they haven\u2019t changed. No matter how depressing the events that our main MC\u2019s go through are, they always end it with a laugh, go back to the guild and the circle is complete, a new arc can start without the characters even being slightly changed. It also doesn\u2019t help that the show takes fanservice very serious, and I find it hard to take scenes that should make me depressed/feel for a female character seriously, when a few shots later they appear in fetish clothing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the thing that matters is if you enjoy a show. If you managed to watch the first show and completely disagree with the things I\u2019ve said so far, than you will probably enjoy this continuation and I\u2019d recommend it. As for anyone else, don\u2019t get fooled by the absurd high rating this show seems to have. It has too many flaws to spend your time on it.\\n",

(this scene was a masterpiece in manga and i even cried, but they make it shit in Anime. \"thou its in season 1\")\\n\r\nKagura nd Milliana vs. Lyon nd Yuka .\\n\r\nGray-sama vs. Rufus . They make Gray-sama looks weak and its so annoying, if you read manga ull know what i mean.\\n\r\nExcutioner vs. Team 2. was shit too. they make natsu looks weak and even mira. -_-\\n\\n\\n\r\nthis was MY OPINION.

The character always full of spirit never giving up and fighting for their friends. If you area fan of this series i recommend giving it a chance, because this series may have it lows or highs but it still a good series to watch an to enjoy.",

Pretty sure this new studio gave Wendy a growth spurt (since when was she this tall? Since when was her hair this long?). They  covered Erza's eye, not sure why, they should've kept it the same. One eye showing is the symbol for seriousness. Gray, not gonna lie, looks a bit ridiculous. It's just the hair and face, the hair is just, guh...\r\nAnyone else notice no one got real development except Wendy and Erza and maybe Gray. Natsu and Lucy have beenthe same through out the entire series.\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nIt was worse than the first series. Sometimes characters don't even look like them selves. It also irks me they keep replaying the same scenes for different moments. Can't they just change it a little?\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI liked the first and second opening, although there were MAJOR spoilers. Opening 17 was bad, like really bad. It was waaay to generic and unoriginal. It didn't suit the show at all.\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nSame old same old. Except random fanservice and the shortest fight I have ever seen (Laxus vs Jura). It was like: Okay we got this and the plot- OH WAIT! CAN'T FORGET TO SHOW OFF LUCY'S BOOBS AND ERZA'S CROUCH! \\n\r\nThe current filler arc has a sort of random plot, that doesn't make any sense so far.It's like it was fueled entirely by fans. At least the original had a story to 'em! \\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n I'd liked it more if Hiro kept the old company or at least this one got more funding to do more animation. And have good filler.\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nC+",

            "content": "Fairy Tail 2014 is the direct sequel to the first fairy tail. It was renewed under a different animation studio hence why you can see the slight difference in the most recent episodes. characters feel more stiff and the animation has gotten a little more dense, which is quite disappointing. I'll say that I'm a strong fan of Fairy Tail for being a Shounen anime I like it more than most BIG animes out there like One Piece, Hunter X Hunter, and Bleach. Although I enjoyed Bleach a hell of a lot more. This anime gives a different approach in terms of aesthetics.\r\nThe sequel ispretty much the same from the previous in every aspect. The story continues right off from the Grand Magic Games Arc, where Fairy Tail 1 ended. The longest arc yet, but arguably the best arc of the anime atm. The fights get more epic and it starts off with a bang, However it trails off in a different direction after the Grand Magic Games end, which is what I expected.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nFor a Shounen anime you shouldn't expect a nice story in the first place. You should expect obtuse writing, OP characters, and cliche fights and conclusions. The traditional fight this guy and get more powerful later, and fight him again and beat him is seen here sometimes. Although this anime tends to go through the ideal of protecting comrades as its trope and main reason for the characters winning the fights. Almost every arc is quite cliche it's nothing special at all, but the fights and unique character design keep you watching it. The arc after the Grand Magic Games arc is the Eclipse Celestial Spirits, which is the most ridiculous/longest arc that I've ever attempted to watch. Seriously just skip it. It's not in the anime and it's utter filler shit. The arcs after it are the Sun Village/Tartoros Arc, which is the big arcs that lead up to big events that you should pay attention at. I won't say much about it since the Tartoros arc is the current arc were on atm (At the time of this review). Overall story is nothing special, but you shouldn't of expected something amazing.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned before. The animation studio got changed resulting in the animation becoming a little bit more stiff like. I don't like it that much, but it's not biggy. The art style in this anime is nothing special, but it's not bad either. It never has bothered me and the fan service art is still there. It's okay and average at best. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nProbably the only reason why I watch this anime and the biggest unique factor it has. The OST to this anime is GOD TIER STATUS. Seriously if you listen to the OST and then watch the anime you feel cheated. I found out about this anime THROUGH the music it has. The anime pales in comparison to the OST. It's the same composer who did Naruto and a few other popular animes that I can't think of atm. Anyway the new OST sounds great, and is almost on par with Fairy Tail's 1 OST.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nThe new characters introduced in Fairy Tail 2 aren't that memorable I must say. The Grand Magic Game arc brings a dark version of Rogue, who I could care less about. The Tartoros Arc has introduced an entirely new guild, with an array of characters. There all pretty generic, but some look cool in terms of aesthetics. A few are quite fan service, but it's w/e. All in all none this is definitely not one of Fairy Tail's strong points. A lot of new characters introduced in this sequel aren't really that impactful.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason I enjoy this anime maybe because it blends the concept of wizards and guilds somewhat well. It's almost something new, but in the end it does feel the same compared to the other shounens out there. This anime had potential to be way better, but the suspense is non existent, which makes it quite stale. However I think some of the fight scenes are extremely well done combined with the GOD TIER music it has. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Solid 8\\n\\n\r\nFor a Shounen I'm not going to complain. I'd choose this over One Piece and Naruto any day. Call me crazy, but I can't stand the ninja/pirate shit. I'd rather go with wizards and guilds. The OST does carry this anime hard, but some characters are likeable like Mystogan, Erza, Laxus, and Jellal. \\n",

When it ends and a long-termed fillers start, my ideas changed and I find this anime boring now. Especially prologue of Tartaros  Arc ist terrible, even tough the chapters which published in manga were excellent. Most of nudity scenes were censored and it affected the anime negative. If the policies of censorship in anime continue like this, the adult fans will go down.\r\nOn the other hand, a lot fightings are extremly absurd and irratinonal. Unfortunately the mangaka of this series thinks little ofthe characters' balance of power. Some characters is shown too powerful and almost invicible, but one of the main characters could beat them easily when he or she gained a power-up. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this series still is perfect and watchable now. But the fictional nonsenses must be removed and censorship must reduce. Otherweise FT 2014 will lose its loyal adult fans like me as I said before.",

            "content": "First of all a Hello to all the Otaku and anime fans .\r\nWell I have been observing that lot's of people are complaining regarding the story that the anime is offering . Every single person has some complains. But for this anime , to complain about plots , character , etc. is not apt. These are all done by the mangaka .So if you wanna curse , then curse Mashima. \r\nNow coming to Fairy Tail anime . Well till the Tenrou Island Arc , we know almost all enjoyed it a lot. And that's what made many to continue the manga . The story's mainplot even began to come to view ( Natsu -Zeref - Dragon thing) . \\n\\n\r\nAbout the new season 7 , what we call Fairy Tail 2014 ,all I can say is that the specific 'anime' related thing has lots of changes - studio, crew, support ,art, etc. Strictly speaking the anime has overall improved or is degrading is not determined by the plot (if it follows a manga) . Rather how it is executed matters ;like fillers , fight scenes , expressions , sound themes, songs ,etc. \\n\\n\r\nThis season is more plot specific and the interests got heightened when we knew that we would be shown dragons and demons . The fights were well executed . Some elements were removed due to content airing restrictions. Lest it could have been more exact to the manga . Still it  was good. \\n\\n\r\nNow regarding the animation part - well when studio and crew change this changes too. At least we should we thankful that we didn't have to end up like Bleach . When after ep 175  FT crew announced that they won't be airing or producing anymore it was a shock for many . But here we are having this show.\\n\\n\r\nNow about current play . The anime team did a wonderful job of putting the Fairy Tail zero filler. As this is part of FT universe and not out of sync filler . It also has some story important to the plot. Especially about Mavis and Zeref .\\n\\n\r\nNow to the music part. well the scoundscape is wonderful and totally complements the setting.\\n\\n\r\nArt is lil' inconsistent , but here in anime world we have seen worse .\\n\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I am worried , is about unnecessary comic expressions . I mean dialogue is pretty near to manga . But some comic part is bit exaggerated than the manga counterpart.\\n\\n\r\nThose who are already updated ,the fun is just gonna increase as better arcs are coming. \\n\\n\r\nWell out team just want that the crew of the anime try to elongate and improve the future fighting. i.e, rather than elongating the episodes with comic part or fillers , try to show more fights, i mean the unseen ones.\\n\\n\r\nRest all is just great . As a magic world fan , you all are gonna love it. Overall a fun loving entertainment with touch of  nakama and compassion.\\n\\n\r\n-Enigma",

But now, all I see in Fairy Tail (2014), it has a lot of flaws and repetitive comedies. The comedies from the previous Fairy Tail may make me chuckled or smiled, but the comedies in Fairy Tail (2014) is nearly or is bland, the flaws are suppose to be corrected.\r\nStory - 7\r\nThe story is good so far, nothing is amazing, I must say.\r\nArt - 7\r\nThe artis good enough. Nothing more than that.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nThey still use the same background musics that I love and the characters' voices are clear for me to hear. Nothing changes and still great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\r\nYeah, they are pretty much like the old Fairy Tail, the characters will first get their ass kicked by the villains, power-up, learnt or obtained new skills, and they kicked back the villains' asses.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\r\nAs I said before, most of the comedies are almost bland. For the fighting scenes with their magics, it made me lock my eyes on the screen, however the static motions in it pretty much ruin it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nI'm still not quite satisfied for this anime, because there is a lot of flaws that they need to cover in order to improve this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'm still hoping for something great happen, at least once, and I will just keep watching it 'til the last episode. Maybe this anime will has a great glory and be on the top, or will it just left a bitter and shameful defeat in this field of entertainment, or will it be loved or hated by the people, or will it be remembered or forgotten in the future, that's what I doubt.",

            "content": "Fairy Tail made a sequel series. Taking place during the grand magic games with a total change in animation. (The style of the show has changed to.) I've read pretty much all the manga up to its current arc but I've only seen about 30 (probably more) random episodes of Fairy Tail 2014. Don't get me wrong? I've seen the 100-something episodes of original Fairy Tail so I know what I'm talking about.\r\nSTORY (1/10)\r\nHonestly, how does Fairy Tail's already cliche story get worse? Honestly, the grand magic games were a long mess and just a another shounen cliche (tournament arc) then were introduced to someweird Dragon Ball Z future Trunks and Cell garbage (with Future Lucy and Rogue) Fairy Tail is so unoriginal. I honestly was excited when I heard that for the first time, a main would permanently die, nope, just an extension of Lucy did, Mashima refuses to kill off a character. Seriously, your stories are uninteresting if I know the characters will never be in danger. now we're in some filler arc involving Lucy (the weakest, blandest member of the entire guild) and her celestial spirits who have now turned completely psycho and I'm not even sure whats going on but I know Natsu will win any fight \"WITH THE POWA OF FRIENDSHIP!\" or some other asspull. I also feel the need now to adress every Fairy Tail arc\\n\\n\r\nMacao and Daybreak arc: start of a terrible series\\n\r\nlullaby arc: i have no memory of this arc.\\n\r\nGaluna Island arc: A pretty good arc, very underrated\\n\r\nPhantom Lord arc:\\n\r\nLoke arc: Honestly, abusive spirit master, Lucy attempted rape that was played for laughs, WTF\\n\r\nTower of Heaven: Good arc, very epic\\n\r\nBattle of Fairy Tail arc: good arc \\n\r\nOracion seis arc: Incredibly long and sometimes boring, final fight was lame but the arc was alright.\\n\r\nDaphne arc: HAHAHAHA, this is why no one like fillers\\n\r\nEdolas arc: Worst arc ever. Such a waste of a good story, it look so promising then it turned into some deus ex machina plot with a weird environmental message.\\n\r\nTenrou island arc: Really made up for the crappy Edolas arc.\\n\r\nX791 arc: The idea of a time skip (seven freaking years, shorten it jeez) where none of the main cast ages is incredibly stupid. I also hate how everyone easily got over what happened.\\n\r\nKey of the Starry sky arc: I'm mixed about this arc\\n\r\nGrand Magic games: Worst arc ever, long and unoriginal\\n\r\nEclipse Celestial spirits arc: WTF\\n\\n\\n\r\nART (3/10)\\n\r\nI actually liked original Fairy Tail's art. Who the hell animated this mess? It looks so bland and generic. All female designs look exactly the same. all of there smiles are cut in two in some weird looking \"moe\" way and all the color has been washed away. If you pause at some points you can see how completely lazy the animators have gotten. No more shadows or good lighting. Oh and what did they do to Erza? What the heck is wrong with her eyes, why is animated like that. And her headhsape and hair. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND (9/10)\\n\r\nThe sound is still great. The soundtrack is awesome and you can completely jam out to eh Openings and Endings. The only problem hat I have are the Opening and Ending visuals (like end 17 and 18 are just random one-shots of Lucy's celestial spirits)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (3/10)\\n\r\nStill the worst part of the show. I didn't go into detail about all the characters but I will now.\\n\\n\r\nNatsu: The worst most bland of all shounen protagonist. He's the typical idiot who never trains yet wins ever fight through the power of nakama and it is so annoying and makes the story boring.\\n\\n\r\nLucy: She is as interesting as buying a can of mayonnaise and starring at it for fifteen hours. I have never seen such a weak uninteresting character ever. Like, she is pathetic and contributes to literally none of the battles, no magic power, no strong will, nothing. We know she will never improve because future Lucy is just as bland.\\n\\n\r\nGray and Erza: Oh yeah, whatever happened to them. They'd be much interesting protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nWendy: Still annoying\\n\\n\r\nLisanna: Why did you survive? And why did the mangaka just kill off Edo-Lisanna like nothing happened?\\n\\n\r\nnow some of the villians\\n\\n\r\nBora: How was he released from prison in the span of a few months and how did he completely reform from cold hearted sociopath to cheery, happy, fun, friendship loving. WTF\\n\\n\r\nI really hate every other character so I'm just going to stop there.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (5/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment is the only reason people like this show, with snazzy fights and boobs galore. I personally find the show enjoyable to, but there are so many things I dislike.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (4/10)\\n\r\nOverall the show is terrible and is the main reason why so many people look down on modern anime. The show is full of plothole after plothole (Laxus being a dragon slayer) mistakes (Ezra would be able cry with eyes, Makarov) and inconsistencies (why are you not looking for Igneel Natsu!!!) and asspulls (oh wait, igneel was inside you the entire time, or Lisanna wasn't dead, she was just chilling in Edolas with all the Exceed)\\n\\n\r\nWow, I hate this show.",

            "content": "The only thing keeping this show alive is its fans. \r\nstories terrible, the plot is reused often. The pacing is terrible it feels really slow. Also, the show is filled with cliche anime factors.\r\nCharacters have no depth, and no development whatsoever. Natsu starts off as a dumb ass and becomes even dumber. Erza just beats the enemy because of plot armor. Lucy just cries and gets saved by Natsu every arc. Gray just strips and is basically bootleg Sasuke. Wendy is just annoying and stays annoying. No characters are likable, all they do is say some shit like \"I'll never let my comrades die, that'smy wizard way\". The designs are just unbearable. Why does every girl have huge tits? Why is Natsu mostly naked but wear a scarf? (scarfs from his dad). \\n\\n\r\nArt is horrible and filled with unnecessary fanservice. The manga art is great, but the anime's art isn't. \\n\\n\r\n Fight scenes suck, Natsu always wins via bull shit Nakama powerup. So basically he gets his ass kicked, then he goes \" I was only using 50 percent of my power\" then he powers up and destroys his enemy. So original and creative omg. His friends don't even do shit, they just appear in his memories. Oh, yea and all the main characters wear a super strong armor that prevents them from getting killed, it's called plot armor.\\n\\n\r\nMedieval soundtracks fit really well. The OST is really great. The openings are also really well done. My favorite one is opening 1 by BoA. \\n\\n\r\nOverall terrible show with no rewatch value.",

            "content": "Not quite sure why Fairy Tail is getting such low review scores, but whatever. \r\nFairy Tail (2014), is the continuation of the anime after a one-year break. The anime took some time off, so that the manga could squeeze in a few more chapters of content. During this break, the anime's art-style changed into it's current \"darker\" tone (which seems to garner a lot of hate, for some reason. Personally, I think it fits the violent nature of the current arcs), and changed studios. It features new, or remixed music, and awesome graphical changes (Natsu's fire no longer looks like copy & paste flames). \r\n2014picks up where the old anime left off, during the Grand Magic Games arc, with Gajeel discovering the Dragon Graveyard. The story continues the usual basis of \"rinse and repeat,\" so to speak, but only for 1-2 arcs, and then the long awaited Tartaros arc began. This arc is where it kicks into high gear, with a ton of revelations, and fights, to keep you interested for a good while. And yes, the fan-service still exists, but it is censored compared to what the anime has to offer (Erza and Kyoka is an example of this. Dear Lord). Recently, though, more changes to the manga have been discovered. I won't spoil this, but you can find out for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is the best part about this new \"season\"/\"series,\" whatever. The art strongly reflects that of the manga now (Gray and Erza having the obvious changes--for the better), and the graphics got a major update. As stated before, Natsu's flames now have a realistic-look to them, instead of being copy & paste, like in the first series. Also, the action sequences are more fluid than the original, with them actually moving around instead of having freeze-frame-type-battles. It still happens sometimes, but it is limited.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is amazing. The OST actually gets you pumped during the battles, and offers a remix of old favorites (recently, on ep. 81, I heard a remixed version of Zeref's Melancholy). The opening themes are amazing as usual, with the only exception (in my opinion) being Op. 17. The ending themes are okay (I usually ignore the ending themes).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, are...well... I'm not sure how to put this. Basically, you have the dimwitted fool (Natsu), sexy fan-service bait(Lucy), loli (Wendy), the male easily annoyed by girls (Gray, to an extent), and the one everyone fears (Erza). The one good thing about the characters, though, is the antagonist--Zeref. While being the usual \"emo,\" he--at first--does not wish to destroy anyone. In fact, he even finishes off one of the main antagonists of a story arc, back in the original series, indirectly helping our heroes. However, after \"being rejected by humanity\" for so long, he soon resolves to destroy everything, in what he calls a \"one-sided annihilation.\" So, basically, you have the traditional shonen line-up, with a few twists. Pretty well done, in a  sense. Oh, and some of you will notice look-a-likes, like Gildarts, for example.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Since I'm technically reviewing FT up until it's current episode (old series, and new), I will have to say that despite it's flaws, it IS a good show. It is the ONLY long-running shonen that I was pretty far behind on, that I caught up to, while not considering it a chore (well, I don't know about that; the Nirvana arc started feeling that way, until Jellal made his appearance). I easily caught up, and started reading the manga from where the old anime left off, resuming the show when it began airing again. Since then, I have watched every episode besides the shitty filler arcs, and I'm still watching it now (just finished 81, earlier). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it has plenty of flaws; enough so, that if you are a picky anime watcher, you might consider passing it up. However, on the bright side, it has a strong story at some points, and somehow manages to draw you in more, and more, until you've stayed up watching 10+ episodes in a row. I would recommend it to any anime-watcher, who likes long-running shows.",

            "content": "This is the sequel series to the Fairy Tail, it picks up right where it leaves off. There really wasn't a need to separate this series from the first because it's all one storyline and separating them doesn't really make sense. Both of them all long anyway and you usually only see separate series when they are different seasons and between the first series and this one, there's 7 seasons plus Zero. This is really a bad thing, I just thought it was really strange.\r\nOnto the series itself, the arcs seem to be getting a lot longer as the series progresses. There are really only3 main arcs in this series (plus Zero) and 1 of them is just a continuation of the Grand Magic Games. The episodes are pretty drawn out but are filled with A LOT of action and strife. That being said I can't say I enjoyed this series better than the first but I can say I thought it was a lot better. The The beginning is great, the middle is pretty meh and the ending is absolutely fantastic. \\n\\n\r\nThe story and action has the same predictability factor to it. You know that Fairy Tail is going to win these fights. It's just watching how they win is what's fun. \"The power of friendship trumps all\" kind of fighting is applied here but not as much as it was in the first series. Towards the end of the first series, you see that the Fairy Tail wizards are actually a force to be reckon with and not just a guild that gets beaten to the brink of death and somehow, miraculously finds a way to win. That gets carried over into this series and as you watch each arc and each fight, you see that the Fairy Tail wizards are crazy powerful and can really take down any foe that comes their way.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all the same, no new characters really get introduced other than the villains but there are already a whole bunch of likable characters and that's one thing I do really love about Fairy Tail. There are A LOT of wizards in the show and all of them have their own different kind of magic that's really fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nA LOT of stuff goes down during the back half of the series so if you aren't enjoying the series as much during the first half (like me), there are some pretty damn good plot points to see in the second half. Things really get serious and no spoilers but if you're really interested in the series, you'll absolutely love it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of each spell, of each type of magic of each character is one of my favorite things about the series. The art is really beautiful and really cool to see. There are a lot of opening/ending themes that are pretty good. The music during the openings get you pumped for the episode and the endings cool you down after the epic fights. It's really entertaining to watch and a pretty good sequel series.\\n\\n\r\nLikes:\\n\\n\r\n-The magic of each wizard is really cool to see\\n\r\n-Zero, was really awesome to see\\n\r\n-Love seeing how powerful each member of Fairy Tail has become\\n\r\n-Tartaros arc, was my 2nd favorite arc behind The Grand Magic Games, things get really serious in this arc and the struggle is seriously real and incredibly exciting to watch.\\n\r\n-I really love watching Natsu fight, because the beginning when he isn't taking it serious, he's aloof and messes around and then when he gets serious is when the action really starts, its funny and entertaining to watch.\\n\r\n-Wendy, she's becomes a total badass, just watch, it's amazing.\\n\r\n-No spoilers but the very last episode really reminded me a lot of the first, I kind of got a sense of nostalgia and realized how far the series has come.\\n\\n\r\nDislikes:\\n\\n\r\n-I really dislike the ecchiness of the series, imo, if you want to tease boob, then just show them, High School DxD showed boob all the time and I didn't care about it, it didn't take away from the action. Fairy Tail just has boobs there with a tiny strip of clothing still covering them which really bothers me because all I think of is how you should still be able to see the nipple there.\\n\r\n-Lucy, she's just so annoying and I can't stand her\\n\r\n-There are a lot of really good plot points in the series but looking back at the first series that some of them tie into, it really leaves a lot of plot holes and unanswered questions. There's always a lot going on and I understand that not everything can be answered but I still can't help thinking about it. It still doesn't ruin it for me though.\\n\r\n-I dislike everything to do with the celestial spirits, the spirits themselves are fine, just The Key of the Starry Sky, Grand Magic Games (kind of), and the Eclipse Celestial Spirit arcs made 3 straight arcs where the celestial spirits and their wizards were incredibly important and it seriously bothered me. Not to mention the fact that Lucy is in the center of it all.",

            "content": "TLDR at the bottom...\r\nI rewrote this because i was bored one day and realized that a lot of the top reviews make a significant mistake when analyzing Fairy Tail. Just for the record, that does not make them bad reviews, its just that the points they bring forward are of an anime that Fairy Tail is in no way trying to be.\r\nTo elaborate, Many people treat Fairy Tail as a 'proper' fighting anime... One where people die, the plot is relevant, things are cohesive and you get an idea of what is happening every second of the characters' day. This is not what Fairy Tailis, you may be misled by the depth of certain situations and relationships however these moments of anger/sadness/fear are simply there in order to present a bigger picture which involves an incredibly happy/loving/familic relationship. If you don't think that kind of thing belongs in a fighting anime then that is fine but I find the teamwork presented in this anime is much more refreshing than your traditional 'line up one by one until we get our last minute trump card\" format.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say that the whole 'trump card' thing doesn't exist in this anime, but it is presented on a much more individual level and is always presented in a way that links back to the happy/love/familic relationship that is shared by all the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to point out is that people seem to think that this anime should be dark... That people need to die or whatever. No. That doesn't need to happen at all. In fact if you want that to happen then you must be some kind of sociopath. Fairy Tail tries to be a 'happy' anime, its all about the fun and says 'to hell' with continuity. \\n\\n\r\nIt is also fair to say that this show, which is all about the relationships, does a very good job of presenting that in their characters. While the characters may lack development over the course of the show i think its a nice way of maintaining an environment that prevents grudges or hatred and more comedic relief and enjoyment. Which is the focus of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOn to actual review sh*t:\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nIt lacks continuity and is relatively predictable however its never tried to be the most important aspect of the show. It seems that when it comes to bad guys we are counting up in twos. Element 4, Oracion Seis (6 in spanish), something something 8, Twatty ten... You get the point, they are not very distinguishable but some do get their places later on in the series and help evolve the show in some way. No body ever dies but, as mentioned before, that wouldn't be befitting of an optimistic anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nShaky at times but over all, it does its job pretty well. Also, lets be honest, i don't think anyone is gonna check every frame for errors so I would just get used to what issues you do find and try to let your imagination patch it together. The main focus goes into the fights rather than dialogue sections, which is why I tell you to use your imaginations. If the quality was consistently sewer water than I would be a bit more bothered about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nYou will probably find that any anime viewer who has seen Fairy Tail has one or two of its tracks on their YouTube playlist or equivalent. The sound track is probably the best I have come across and does its job perfectly. If you only watch Fairy Tail for one thing, let it be the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe main focus of the anime... While they don't develop all that much I think its fair to say that they are all quite unique and distinguishable. If you don't like them all that much then i wouldn't be surprised if you gave up a few episodes in. Even then, it would take a novel to describe what they add to the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis show is not going to outsmart you, nor is it going to tug at your heart strings (maybe) but so long as you don't go into it with your detective cap on (or your nit picking hat on) and just embrace its simplistic nature and its happy/love/familic focus, you will soon realize that the show is packed full of funny, interesting and bad ass moments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI originally rated this lower but after about a month i realized that it was still in my mind and despite being 265 episodes long, I actually wanted to watch it again (I don't often go for the lengthy ones). So I will probably wait half a year. After all, its not like a 12 episode anime that i can clear in a day or so (is that normal?... I'm scared to ask).\\n\\n\r\n(Sorry if I seemed a bit ranty but I have to point out a few things about the nature of the show and a few remarks that were made that didn't sit right with me. I would also like to point out that i do think this show has flaws, I just like it a lot and also happen to be quite sarcastic, even by British standards)",

As personagens consideradas principais s\u00e3o: Natsu, Gray, Erza, Lucy, Wendy, Happy e Charles.\r\nO que mais gostei no anime foi a qualidade da imagem e a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre as personagens e personagem/espectador e a trilha sonora.\r\nO quedetesto no anime \u00e9 o facto de demorar muito tempo para ser lan\u00e7ado um novo epis\u00f3dio(incrivelmente longo)\\n\\n\r\nApesar do tempo que demoram para publicar um novo epis\u00f3dio, recomendo este anime a quem gosta de com\u00e9dia, a\u00e7\u00e3o e aventura nos animes e de uma bela qualidade de imagem.\\n\\n\r\n1\u00aa Temporada: http://www.animeai.net/386046.html\\n\r\n2\u00aa Temporada: http://www.animeai.net/292993.html\\n\\n",

            "content": "3rd ever review and counting ;)\r\nWill keep the review short and sharp to the point. Will assume you have seen season 1\r\nStory:\r\nAs like S1 the are numerous arcs that occur starting from the second half of the Grand Magic Games. I felt like the arcs were semi-ok, I wasn't the biggest fan of the filler arcs but i mangaged. My personal favourite of course is Tartorus Arc, ah the feels the ninjas with their damn onions back at it again.\r\nArt:\r\nAlot of people are turned off from the animation in several reviews I've read and I do agree however i suggest having a break between seasonsand you'l eventually get used to it. Not much to say here. Has good animation for a 2014 anime adaption and I liked it. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nLike art but i loved every opening I even downloaded every opening and have it on my phone so it brings back the feels ;)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nStill a fair amount of fan service but besides that I only really saw a GREAT improvement in each character in the last arc Tartaros. From the useless whiny characters to the main characters I felt that is is such a big improvement from season 1.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs you can see from my score I throughly enjoyed watching all of fairy tail and fairy tail 2014, such a great series\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nTowards the ending of the series I learnt there will be a time period where the anime will continue again. So i recommend when the new season starts buckle up, shut up and get the tissues ready gonna be a bumpy ride\\n\\n\r\nP.S i read alot of reviews and i agree with somewhat of their points but trust me just give fairy tail a chance and you won't regret it\\n\\n\r\n-Have a nice day and hope this review helped, B_Raiden_",

            "content": "I really don't get why this show so low ratings. I mean sure, there are a hell of a lot more fillers than in the prequel, but these fillers are actually quite enjoyable and funny, unlike for example Bleach's filler episodes. \r\nThe story isn't very outstanding at all, like pretty much every Shounen anime that exists. Though it is probably the lack of story that makes me keep watching Fairy Tail. Whenever I start watching an episode of Fairy Tail, I always hope that all the questions will be answered and all the puzzels will be solved. But in most cases, I get a newadventure or a filler, but that's okay. Really. Because that is why I keep struggling with Fairy Tail. \\n\\n\r\nI'm really tired of people saying \"this is not Fairy Tail anymore\" or \"it doesn't follow the manga\". First of all it's boring if the series only follows the manga and why the hell wouldn't it be Fairy Tail? The biggest difference is the change of art style and I don't feel like the story has been changed, nor the characters. It's the freakin' same series but with a new name. That's all.",

            "content": "welcome ladies and gents to a review that is made based entirely of my own opinion, if you don't like hearing the opinions of others please do move along because this isn't the review for you... but now that i think about it, if that were the case then no reviews would be for you since all reviews has some kind of personal attachment from the person who wrote it. Now let us get started shall we?\r\nSo unlike many people here, i didn't watch fairy tail from the beginning, I hadn't even heard of it up until 11 days before the 2014 version was meantto air. Intrigued by the premise of the series as well as it's infamous reputation for excessive fan service, i decided to watch the original season and finished it just in time to watch season 02 (2014 version) which i have been watching weekly since then.\\n\\n\r\nnow on to the actual review shall we?\\n\\n\r\nthe story:\\n\\n\r\nso this is your basic shounen story that has a story but never really sticks to it however there is both good and bad to be found in that. the bad being that it can get tiresome fast if you've seen many shounen anime, it get's repetitive at some points and the often used \"nakama power-ups\" does kill some of the enjoyment, but in saying that, there is also an upside to this. if you're looking for something that has great comedy (at times), or you want to watch something that will make you want to break whatever viewing method you use to watch anime or even if you just want to be hit in the feels, then fairy tail has it all for you and in droves!! also not forgetting the often used \"the girls are hot so lets put them in fan service situations\" trope and you're pretty much good to go.\\n\\n\r\nnow for those who might say, \"well yeah so what? i hate fairy tail because the original story was natsu looking for his father\"... uh... yeah NO! fairy tail was meant to chronicle the life and times of lucy heartfelia and her time in fairy tail! I would like to say right now that i believe that at the true end of fairy tail, we're going to find out it was nothing more than lucy reading a penned down version of events that she did after she became an accomplished author, to her daughter (probably named lalya).\\n\\n\r\nbut then you might say \"well there are other shounen that stick to the plot\" well yeah, you can say that! but just as there are anime that stick to it's premise, there are those that don't. like seriously, at least everything that happens in fairy tail is about fairy tail, what about dragonball/z/super? named after the thing that is meant to be it's central plot and was aptly said plot during the first half of dragonball but then became nothing but a trope to raise the dead in later episodes/seasons.\\n\\n\r\nmoving on...\\n\\n\r\nso the arcs withing 2014 were a hit and miss with some people. for example, i liked most of the celestial spirits filler arc while many didn't. likewise other people felt the same about the other arcs. what the arcs do present though are a little backstory to some characters, a little fleshing out of some characters as well as an emotional hit through nostalgia\\n\\n\r\n[spoiler]testing testing, did this spoiler work?\\n\\n\r\ni hate doing reviews of series that are ongoing, you know why? because people complain about shit that didn't happen at the time that happened later on in said series. and if it's the reason they scored it low, even more so to avoid said reviews until it's updated after completion.  --> many complained about natsu losing his way about finding his father, well news flash and massive SPOILER, NATSU FINDS IGNEEL TOWARDS THE LATER PART OF FAIRY TAIL 2014[/spoiler]\\n\\n\r\nand now the characters:\\n\\n\r\ni will not explain a lot here, why? because 2014 is not a reboot, it's a continuation of where the 2009 version stopped before it went on hiatus during the grand magic games arc, which means if you're reading this review, you've already watched the first 175 episodes and are considering whether or not to follow up by watching the 2014 variant. With that being the case, you already know everything you need to know about the characters by now and if you don't, what were you paying attention too? there's no characters introduced in the 2014 version that are of any relevance and those that are were here prior to the 2014 airing.\\n\\n\r\nnow the art:\\n\\n\r\none thing people complained about a lot was the new art style, it lacked colours (it was visually dark) and the characters don't look as good as they did before, well i choose to disagree.\\n\\n\r\nfirstly while i do not hold anything against those who have an opinion of whether something was to their liking or not, i do have a problem with people who complain that this is how \"it should've been done\" really? like really? those who have the necessary qualifications for the animation industry aside, most people who complain actually know nothing about actual animation and their processes, yet they think that what was done was wrong? seriously? hey i can understand not liking it, but many who complained are those whose alternative is black and white static images with no sound so wouldn't any animation be better than no animation?\\n\\n\r\nthe character designs look more like their source material designs and the dark shadows used i feel are more than suited for the darker arcs seen in 2014, so yeah i won't say any more than that because i'm not qualified in the field of animation and i would be a hypocrite if i said things that aren't factual.\\n\\n\\n\r\nthe sound:\\n\\n\r\nbest part! the openings and endings were memorable, the OST never fails to hit the right note and induce emotions more readily in certain situations whether that be laughter or tears. it fits in well with what the series portrays and that's about all i'm saying on the matter.\\n\\n\\n\r\noverall:\\n\\n\r\nwatch it if you want to continue the story of fairy tail but don't want to take to reading the manga. it has the same vibe that fairy tail always had so whether that's your cup of tea is for you to decide.",

The story suffers no change after the year hiatus from season one and is even improved this time around\r\nArt:9/10 Now for the second season some of the characters got redesigns and some are very small like Wendy's hair color went from a type of deepocean blue color to a light purple blue color (Which is a very good  improvement) and some characters got HUGE design changes like Erza and Lucy but the art in general the art is very eye appealing and love it more then the art from the first season.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10/10 Oh god yes the sound is so much better then the first seasons the openings like the 15th and the 16th i still listen to them from when i first heard them and the soundtrack from the first season is reused at moments but most of the time there remixes \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10/10 the characters are still the same from the first season and get even more development in the second season \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10 did i like this show?.......AYE SIR!!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10/10 now if you liked the first season you will most likely enjoy the second now to clarify some misunderstandings about the ending of episode 102 some think that the anime and manga is over with due to the ending of episode 102 (don't worry no spoilers here fam) now the MANGA is not ending its still going and its going strong how ever the anime is a different story the anime is going on another hiatus (again like wtf) so yes there is a new anime being made but was put on hiatus due to the anime catching up to the manga so quick (oh and the new anime is going to continue off where episode 102 left off most likely from what i heard)\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!!~KOBO",

            "content": "Fairy Tail is one of the big anime who most people around the world, know about it. This show is hated by many people and loved by the most fans. Fairy Tail season 1, for me, was fine but, season 2, I think, it's better. I am writing this review based on my personal opinion.\r\nTHIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS!!!\r\nSTORY ( 7/10 )\r\nI think the story is better than the first season. The appearances of the dragons, stronger dark guilds and the story of first guild master Mavis were very good for the plot. I liked how they continue the Grand Magic Games and howthey end it with the win of Fairy Tail. They showed some of the backstory of Zeref which I find it, a very good idea for the plot. What I didn't like so much was the Sun Village arc and the power of friendship who make Fairy Tail win every fight.\\n\\n\r\n CHARACATER ( 7/10 )\\n\\n\r\nWell, the characters were good enough, I think. Natsu is the same as in first season with the exception that he is stronger. He remains an hyperactive person who wants to fight every enemy he meets and who cares for his friends, a lot!! Lucy is more stronger, getting all the celestial spirits and she is capable to fight with every opponent. I liked the character development of Gray. They made him very strong which made him cool. He doesn't stop to get undressed though. Erza remains the same as in the first season.\\n\r\nGenerally, they remain the same as in the first season with the only difference that they are stronger.\\n\\n\r\nART ( 8/10 )\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was a lot better than the first season. They have shown more blood, which I find it a good point. The shapes of the characters and the colors improved a lot. The fights were, also, good. The new moves and new magic of the characters were a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND ( 10/10 )\\n\\n\r\nI think that the music is the best in what Fairy Tail can offer. The openings songs are great such as the endings. The OSTs are very pleasantly. Some of their songs are my favorites. Every soundtrack was very suitable for its scene. The voice actors were, also, good.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT ( 8/10 )\\n\\n\r\nI think this season was better than the previous one in all the categories. I enjoyed a lot and was worth it to watch it and kill my time with it. The comedy and the drama were good. The adventure was great. So, I think is a good anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL ( 8/10 )",

You get that feeling of excitement and entertainment. Each character has their own back story and is very interesting to see each characters back story.\r\nCharacter: All the characters are easy to understand, they all have different personality. If your into comedy then you should watch Fairy Tail. They all will make you laugh and they also inspire you, possibly even change your personality. They all treat each other like family and itmakes you wish you were a part of Fairy Tail.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is very easy to understand.

            "content": "As you all know this is a direct sequel to the adventurous, exciting fairy tail series. I enjoyed it quite a lot. I watched it with my mother who is now 56.  I read the reviews written about this sequel and put it aside for  a long time. But as i did have no other long running anime series which are completed, i chose  this to show  my mom. \r\nHere is what i felt.\r\nStory:  It is good to know in the first few episodes about what the arc is. That is to prevent some evil dragon before it becomes dragon(Eclipse Project). So i wanted to see it. \\n\\n\r\nBut i dropped it and even writing this review for the following reasons :\\n\\n\r\n1. There are scenes where unnecessary comedy is used. In the prequel of the series, one gets so focused on the fighting scenes  and gets involved in it. But here, even the opponent  is shown to wait till their entire comedic act finishes.\\n\\n\r\n2. Over presentation of ecchi content. Conversation is too perverted. Profanity .\\n\\n\r\n3. Degradation of so many characters' main traits such as making serious characters so dull and tamed. Like the one who fights for fairytale leadership  ( i do not remember his name - but he is with thunder power).\\n\\n\r\n4.  Again Gray to won after getting beaten very badly by rufus who can use any kind of magic just with memorization.  There is no   emotion that is showcased in the anime scenes when Gary showcases his power which defeats Rufus.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally i dropped it for too much fan service and degradation of the character nature. Natsu never cared for girls but treated everyone in the same way. But from the OP song it seems that there will be some \\n\r\nunnecessary tie up between the main characters. Natsu is shown to implore lucy to wear swimsuits is so deviating from his original character as shown in the prequel.\\n\\n\r\nFor me Natsu was in line with Naruto and Luffy of one-piece who are decent and symbol of heroes of character. Watching this sequel made me very angry with the author and designer of the sequel. I am so judgmental about this that anime are supposed to be relaxing but it is becoming one of the bad addictions that people must avoid. So children must avoid all the anime that are coming these days, is what i am feeling now. \\n\\n\r\nI saw Ghibli movies and after searching for why Mr. Miyazaki stopped making anime, i empathize with his ideology and  hope Japanese anime would have more such people so that anime which are supposed to deliver good message would not become an alternative to adult content shows.",

            "content": "Spoiler Free: \r\nTo start this review off, I want to exclaim that Fairy Tail 2014 is not a good anime. This will cause many looking at this review to wonder why I gave it such a high review then. To address your question its high rating is solely based on the fact I view the show as more of a guilty pleasure, something that I can unwind and just enjoy the fights, great music/ops, and simple story. In many cases, I watched Fairy Tail when I had a long day and just wanted to have fun. The show has shown an adherent ability to makethe watchers feel emotions and it is just what you need to get you out of a slump. To this, I recommend the show as something you go into not expecting an extremely plot-driven story with thousands of loopholes that make you think for years.\\n\\n\r\nTo add if you have already watched the first series there are some issues that pop up in this sequel unlike its original. To credit the original Fairy Tail it had amazing art and animation, sadly this sequel is far from it. For this series, the production studio changed and it is very noticeable, the show looks darker and a lot of the scenes just look terribly drawn.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is as amazing as always and in my opinion, some of the intros are even better than in the original. My favorite op being the opening for the Zero/Mavis flashback arc. The osts in the episodes also amazing and fit many of the scenes pretty well but music can really be opinion based.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place right where the prequel left it, unlike the prequel is fails at pacing. The at many times felt like it was standing still in the same area for multiple episodes. This is best seen in the extremely long Tataros arc even though it was only 21 episodes long. It felt as if it could be cut down to 16 or so with ease but that all goes down to the production studio and those who want to milk the show for all they can.\\n\\n\r\nMy last note is the characters, I felt the charters at many points made great strides. Their personalities haven't changed but their mindset at times has become noticeably different. *Spoiler Territory* Natsu showed that he has come to term with moving on following Igneels death, making a resolution that he has to get stronger to protect everyone and destroy acnologia.  Gray experienced meeting his father again just to lose him in a very similar manner to Natsu, instead of blabbering he gained the resolution to take on his father's mission of defeating END even if it meant fighting with Natsu at the time. There were some other examples with Jellal and Erza but I think you get the point.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, I feel there isn't much to cover with this review that others haven't. Hopefully, this review is helpful to anyone planning on watching Fairy Tail 2014 or anyone looking to reaffirm their viewpoint. To anyone reading this have a nice day.",

            "content": "SOME SPOILERS !!!JUST TO BE AWARE !!\r\nThis is totally based on my personal opinion of the entire series as a whole. That includes Fairy Tail first season. Okay so first Fairy tail is one of my all time favorite anime's that is mainstream. I honestly never expected that season two would end, i honestly thought that Fairy Tail would be like another one piece you know NEVER ENDING!! well so far as anime, i know that the manga is still in the works. \r\nI even read some of the manga and i didnt expect Fairy Tail 2014 to end *SPOILER* where natsu and lucy goout and find the rest of the guild members* Im not gonna lie i was a bit upset that they decided to stop the anime right there. Like yes its a good spot to \"STOP\" but they totally could have kept the anime going with new adventures finding the members. \\n\\n\r\nNow i just hope and pray that maybe down the line they will make a season 3 once the manga is close to finishing but i dont see that happening anytime soon. \\n\\n\r\nI loved Fairy Tail 2014, even though it did get repetitive at times with the whole \"oh natsu is mad, someone targets the guild and hurts a member and then the whole guild bands together to destroy the enemy\" yes it was a repetitive cycle. However the character development and the new characters are what made this anime so interesting.We can all tell that Natsu was definitely getting stronger but not just him, you saw development in other characters like Gray, Erza, Lucy and even Gajeel, and Levi. You saw them grow and as the anime progressed you started to build a stronger connection with them. \\n\\n\r\nCompared to the first Fairy Tail, in Fairy Tail 2014 i loved the arcs. The grand magic games was my favorite one and then the Dragon one. I loved the different arcs that this season gave. You also get to see more in depth about the characters background story *SPOLIER* like gray with his father, or Lucy and her family. \\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment for this i give it a 9 because you get a little bit of everything. You can cry, laugh, get anger, etc its like a roller coaster of emotions this season. The battles are well point together, i feel like their more crisp than the first season. The characters (old and new) will make you love them even more when you follow their journey. Personally I enjoyed the entire anime, I'm really sad to see it end. But their always the manga. But Fairy tail will always have a close spot in my heart <3",

            "content": "Fairy 2014 is the second series of anime based off the popular manga Fairy Tail written by Hiro Mashima and continues where the original anime left off. But how well does this adaptation hold up compared to its predecessor...\r\nPretty damn well actually, with a new animation studio (the one that did the Fairy Tail Movie which was decent) and new material to create this version is pretty much equal to the original.\r\nStory: The one thing that I notice many have issue with this adaptation is where it starts off which is the second part of The Grand Magic Games Arc which wasn't well recieved inany of the versions produced. However, I found that the anime tried to make the arc enjoyable with its stellar animation quality and awesome character moments (+ fan-service if your into that sort of thing...). The whole future subplot is kinda annoying and unnecessary at times but as someone who enjoyed the arc in the manga I understand that liking it is a minority opinion. The second arc - Eclipse Celestial Spirits - is an anime only version which is rather bad and boring for the second arc of the anime but their are some funny moments that made me laugh but the writing was never really polished or the 'fights' were rather basic but I knew that they were saving all of their talent for the next part of the anime - Taratarous. This Arc was perhaps one of the most beautiful, well  acted and emotional parts of any Fairy Tail season produced. The Arc didn't shy away from some of the darker themes (such as torture) or even character deaths as not only villains but good guys died to (I won't spoil who). All characters were involved and had something to do with a few members from the other guilds making an appearance. Finally, the anime ended with Fairy Tail Zero which is 10 episodes of the origin of Fairy Tail and its first master Mavis Vermillion (who is so adorable) and the other two were the set up episodes for a new journey staring Natsu, Lucy and Happy. The arc was obvious filler for the show as they need to allow the manga to get ahead in order to start producing more episodes but it was nice to see it animated and the characters were awesome to watch but that damn cliff-hanger ending that hints at another season...in 2017 (FUCK!!!!!) - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Basically the same as the old anime with a bit more development and whilst I dislike some characters most of the cast is as fun loving as usual. The anime also hints at a few blossoming relationships that may be ignited *Ahem* GALE *AHEM* - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Whilst I thought that the three main arcs were animated beautifully (especially in the fight scenes) I found that the animation in the filler arc and filler episodes was kinda boring and lackluster which possibly showed cracks of a tighter budget - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Another beautiful soundtrack that pays homage to the original with some remixes of old tracks and some brand new ones that even show it up! The openings are still amazing with a mixture of slow, calm and serious vs rock, upbeat and fun ones. My personal favorites are opening 18, 21 & 22.\\n\r\n-DUB/SUB: I would have to say to watch the sub for now as the dub isn't completed yet. But both sides to a good job of voicing the characters in all of their glory but I would have to say that the Japanese voice actors do better in the more emotional parts of the serious but the dub (from what I've seen) does better in the comedic areas. - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: whilst it does have fan service in it and is kinda perverted at times (much like the manga) but it also is a fun-loving and competent adventure/action/drama/comedy narrative with a range of characters that will make you laugh, cry or scream :) - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Fairy Tail 2014 is a sequel done right and whilst it has a shaky start, the ending does not disappoint and I can't wait to see more of Natsu and the gang in the future. - 8/10\\n\r\n(Which is 2017 for the anime viewers...but I read the manga to!)\\n",

            "content": "Okay, so we all know Fairy Tail is a classic anime. By that I mean, that it is an oldie, but a goodie. Overall I give it a 7, just because one of the arcs were really really bad. That, and a couple of other things.\r\nLets start with its art style: 6-7ish\r\nFairy Tail's animation in its 2014 continuation has improved simply due to technological improvements, making the fighting scenes more fluent.  However, solely based on its art, I am still not the biggest fan of it. I mean, sometimes I really feel like the character and costume designs are almost lazy, as if halfwaythrough the brainstorming stage, Hiro Mashima was just like: 'yeah whatevs this bikini and pop of colour is good enough.'\\n\r\nNot only that, but I mean, just search up this one character: Chapati Lolaand, and tell me that this isn't uninspired: . \\n\r\nWho cares about side characters, amiright? Some people may disagree with me, but honestly, we all know there is better.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7-8\\n\r\nOkay, so I absolutely love it. I get many feels from this series, but just putting my focus on 2014, I really don't like one of the arcs (Eclipse Celestial Spirits). Also I get annoyed that there is a constant reminder that: 'Fairy Tail is our guild! A FAMILY I SAY. NEVER GIVE UP BECAUSE WE IS FAMILY.' It is okay to mention every now and again, but really? AGAIN? It's the same message that they have said nearly every single battle. That being said, weirdly enough... it does tend to work more often than not.\\n\r\nOnly of late, I really am enjoying it, and having read the manga ahead, I am happy to see that the anime follows it pretty well. It hits me in the feels.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nWell this is one of the reasons why I continue to watch this show. I am in love with all the characters and their determination and quirks. They have stayed the same which is great to see. Only there is one problem. I wish that they could grow even more than where they are now, (in which in the manga they do). Also my shipper heart just wishes that relationships can actually become canon in some cases. I understand this isn't a romance or shoujo anime, but I wouldn't mind seeing something blossom. In saying that, again, this keeps me 'nawwing' at particular scenes when something does happen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nFairy Tail has pretty much what you expect from it's original series as it follows the manga pretty on point. It still has those kind of scenes you would expect like 'never give up', and 'WE ARE Fairy Tail,' and has a lot of fillers that can be skipped (although some are really good). I'm certain that this anime will become better especially that they are in a pretty good place right now. So as much as I have bagged out this series, I wouldn't mind being a part of the Fairy Tail guild myself.",

            "content": "**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**\r\n(I mean it's shounen, so who gives a crap ...) \r\nHey! Remember that fun, light adventure anime with lots of humor, no bullshit recap, satisfying action, one liners and lots of badassery? Yeah, me too! So where the fuck did it disappear to? \r\nThis review is written solely for people who've watched original series (but then again ... if you didn't watch the original, why the hell would you be looking this one up? damn man, you're weird) and will reference, what I consider to be, two halves of one Fairy Tale. Pun indented. \r\nFairy Tail is somewhat of a guilty pleasureto me. It's an anime I'd oftentimes turn on just for laughs and chills and some Natsu badass moments. It's something you can always watch and relax. Sure, it had its \"dramatic\" moments, but they were extremely light. The anime knew what it was and never really tried being anything more. It was mindless fun and it was great as it was. So what in the flying flip of fucks happened? Where did the theme of light adventure go? Why are the fun characters replaced with brooding morons who spit out 'woe is me' lines more often than Bella from Twilight? Why the fuck do we have 8 minutes of recap each damn episode? Well, let's try and figure it out. Here's my theory on what happened: \\n\\n\r\nThe writer of the Fairy Tail decided he'd like his next manga to be darker and more mature, but first decided to experiment his bullshit ideas on Fairy Tail. Well, he obviously fucked it up, and what was supposed to be a fun anime you can just randomly turn on to relax, switched into something so annoyingly boring you might as well re-watch 175 episodes of the first season, 20 of the 2nd, and leave the 60 to rot in hell where they belong. \\n\\n\r\nVillains in Fairy Tail were always cartoony and over the top. They were annoying, would spit bullshit left and right, but you were able to tolerate them mostly because they either looked cool or had cool magic or whatever. People like Jellal (please, just kill off this character; he's literally a walking depression at this point), Hades, Zero, etc.. They were all over the top, but hell, it was enjoyable seeing Natsu whoop their ass with some fire. But \"villains\" in the aftermath of Magic Games Arc (hell, even during it if we're being honest) are just flat out annoying. They're not intimidating, you don't really want to see them dead, you just want to see them gone because they annoy the crap out of you. The arc that the anime is currently in brings forth set of 9(10) new \"villains\" out of which LITERALLY 0 have any intimidating presence or cool magic. They're running joke. Unless this \"END\" bullshit demon turns out to be the coolest shit in the world, I'll literally call last 30 episodes of this anime the worst in its history (didn't read the manga, stopped a while ago). \\n\\n\r\nI still actually haven't touched on what really happened to the show, so here it is, brutal truth: Fairy Tail has always been a pussy-out type of a show, meaning that nobody dies. After a while you just kind of accept it and roll with it. This also meant that it underlined all the potential heartbreaking moments, but you weren't watching Fairy Tail for that shit. In addition, the anime was always about Fairy Tail kicking someone's butt, about hyping the newfound, random powers that came out of nowhere, but you dealt with it because that shit was cool. Here's the anime past Magic Games Arc (and somewhat during it): pussy-outs are everywhere. Characters \"die\" every 2 episodes, and each time they're supposed to \"die\", they are given about 10 minutes of sobbing and crying. Even when it so happens that it looks like 1 of them will die (not even a main character), turns out she won't die, Lucy just won't be able to summon her again. Everything is now dark, everything is about gloom, about revenge, about this, that and stuff Fairy Tail was never about. Author tries to make his story more \"mature\" and \"epic\", but fails to realize that we know he can't. He doesn't have balls to kill anyone off. Hell, he doesn't have balls to make Fairy Tail lose. We're talking about a dude who literally made an entire arc that lasted nearly 40 episodes just to bring a single character back to life. Remember that. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on from the story which is just a plothole shitfest even a 5 year old mentally challenged kid can dissect into pieces, let's talk about the characters. They're 1 of 3 reasons I liked Fairy Tail. There are a lot of them, and each has its own merits: Lucy is a straight man, Happy and Natsu are just Happy and Natsu, Erza is Erza, etc. Each character was fun on his/her own, but was also fun when set up against the others. So what the fuck happened? Gray is literally a walking flashback now. Each time this dude appears in the show, we get a flashback about something that happened in 10th episode of the 1st season. I swear, in the past 30 episodes, he had more flashback than in the arc that was MADE ABOUT HIM. You might as well pit him up with Jellal and have a walking disaster as they would make depression a virus that spreads faster than piss with the wind. Natsu turned into a fucking wuss. Dude gets beaten up left and right (during Giants arc or whatever, he gets beaten up with a dude wielding a fucking mechanical hand), has 1 relatively badass moment in 40 episodes (which was against a random flying thing or whatever; let that sink in. Actually, that might as well be called the most badass moment in the past 50 episodes. Against some random animal that had no tie-in to the story. Let that sink in) and offers nothing else. There's this scene during the last arc whereas he finds headquarters of this dark guild and busts in. You expect something like what happened with Sabertooth, for him to go badass mode and do something, but nope, he gets captured in like 10 seconds. You might as well rename Laxus into deus-ex-machina, Erza into \"I'll beat you but first you need to whoop my ass for 20 minutes for no reason\", Lucy into ... well, let's face it, she's always been bouncing boobs really. But hell, screw that; Lucy had the most badass moment of all during the arc against 9 demons of hell. Please, just think of that for a second. Just for a second. Lucy. A character who was literally made to be a fanservice cow. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of fanservice, I want to give this anime some credit. In manga, there were a few scenes that were just brutally dumb, honest to Satan retarded, but anime managed to work them out somehow. Props to literally telling the mangaka \"dude, like, this ain't no hentai bro, chill down\". \\n\\n\r\nThe only even remotely interesting character at the moment is Wendy. I mean, the little girl has her own badass moments here and there. Who would have thought, right? \\n\\n\r\nHumor is scarce nowadays in Fairy Tail. You'll encounter it a few times in the episode, while the rest is about either flashbacks, atonement for some random shit, speeches about how humans are weak, shit and rely too much on emotions, speeches about how that's what makes humans strong not week, pointless \"I'll save everyone\" speeches that literally overshadow any action. I swear to the sweet holy Satan, there hasn't been a single interesting fight in this anime that was actually exciting and looked cool visually since Natsu vs Two Dragon dudes. The closest this season came to having that was Natsu against random flying cat-looking thing. No, not even Natsu vs Rogue. It was about 90% speeches and repeated animations and about 10% anything remotely interesting. Not even Celestial King vs Underworld King. That in itself should scream awesome fight but nope. Not even Gray vs his dad (o yeah, get a load of this \"amazing\" storytelling here man, it'll shake the foundations of literature), nothing, zero. Even animation has somehow dulled from the last season. To this day, I still think that Natsu vs Zero had by far the best animation, followed closely by Natsu vs Jellal (and that shit was literally years ago). I don't know. I'm really close to just throwing my hands up in the air and saying \"Fuck this shit\". \\n\\n\r\nMusic is still here though. It's good and you can easily listen it outside of anime and have good time, but that's about it. This anime literally turned into a random experiment because no one has a clue on what the fuck they're doing with this thing. Fairy Tail's world was never set out for serious storytelling, deep characters and exploration of humanity and humans. It was about fun, light adventure with decent one-liners and badass fights. What did it turn into? A walking mess of woe, characters acting like a five year old throwing a fit because you didn't buy her iPhone, and so many cop-outs, random power-ups and sudden \"revelations\" that it trumps over its previous season, Naruto and Bleach combined. Holy crap this is one hell of a mess. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, if you're thinking about watching this, I'd rather just watch, what I call, \"the Good half of Fairy Tail\". Things kind of went astray after the 7 years speed-forward, but it still somewhat held it charm during the games. Now everything is just ... sigh ... whatever. Fuck this thing.",

            "content": "Minor spoilers btw\r\nOk, so for a while I've seen people around claim that fairy tail 2014 has ruined the fairy tail series as an anime. Well that may be true to some extent, saying that it's \"ruined\" imo is a BIG overstatement. Now I will admit that the the 2014 version is definitely a down grade from the old one. I'm not that nice. But I can arguably agree that the current one is still watchable and enjoyable to see if you are a fan of fairy tail.\r\nStory (7): I'm not even going to mention the filler arc. We all know how atrocious that was.For continuing the canon story though, I say that fairy tail 2014 has done a decent job. The addition of the whole Lucy and Natsu witnessing the dragons terrorizing the town moments made the Grand Magic Games arc feel a little more darker than what it was made to seem in the manga. Plus, though its very minimal, there was blood. Even the current Tartaros arc that's airing now is being adapted pretty well. There is still a bit of moments in the plot where you can question whether it was are justifiable or not, but if your somebody like me you try not to make things like that such a big deal that it prevents you from watching a could be good show for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5): I think this is what most people are having a problem with fairy tail 2014, and tbh, compared to what it was in the original anime...it sucks. That's only when you make an comparison though. There are plenty of scenes you can look up where the animation is good to the point where you could talk about it all night...but at the same time there are plenty of scenes half assed to the point that you wonder if the animators are even giving a damn about the show anymore. I can still argue that out of all the long running shounen anime that has aired back then and is currently airing right now, fairy tail overall still beats the other series by a good amount in terms of animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7): It's still pretty good. Heck, I would download the whole soundtrack if I could. However comapared to the old ost which literally made people have eargasms 24/7, it probably will never beat it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7): I'm not the one to be so upset when someone hates on a character. It's only when the excuse to hate on the character becomes so clich\u00e9 where you can't help but cringe everytime you hear it. And I'm afraid that is what happened to almost the entire cast of fairy tail. Now, what is the clich\u00e9 excuse you ask? It's not the fact that Natsu is \"typical\", it's not the fact that Lucy and Gray are \"only used for fanservice\", and it's not because all of Erza's fights are \"complete bullshit\". I think some of you are realizing what I'm getting at...I'm talking about how they apparently \"don't have any character development\". I don't want to get too deep with this topic because I don't really want this review to be too long. , but it just irritates me when I ask somebody why they hate Natsu or why they hate Lucy, and all they reply is with \"oh, they don't have any character development\". First of all, if you still think these characters don't have a single drop of development even after 6 years worth of airing this show, I seriously suggest that you go watch from the begnning again or else your probably on something. Character development shouldn't be something that makes a character for you, it should be something that makes the character better. Personality-wise and as PEOPLE, Natsu, Lucy, Gray, Erza, you name it, ALMOST everybody in the show has something to love about them and hate about them. Could they use more depth? Of course. LOL, Did you think I was calling these characters masterpieces? I would love for everything in fairy tail to not go so well for them all the time. I even sometimes forget if anything ever really bad happened in their lives. Although, that shouldn't make them necessarily downright terrible.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6): Unfortunately with the disappointment in production quality, fairy tail has sometimes been a chore to watch rather than me being on my toes waiting for next week's release. I can finish an episode saying \"Wow! That was really good!\" or \"Meh, felt like I wasted my time on that one.\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6): Where as to I gave the previous series an 8, I give this one a 6. It might change after this current arc.\\n\\n\r\n So yeah, short review. I was more trying to express a positive opinion toward the show I guess. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So season 2 of fairy tail, wow. Fairy tail  has been though lots. 20 arcs in the anime series 1 & 2. ?(Counting the FT zero part)~ Most of the arcs were pretty enjoyable for any fairy tail fan, except the Celestial spirit arc was a pretty bad filler tbh. Especially since all the \"fights\" between the celestial spirits ended in the dumbest and most disappointing way to me. :( \u2800\u2800\u2800\r\n\u2800The animation was actually a disappointment to me, I'm sorry I prefer the original/old animation better. Sorry in my opinion the colors look better, but the newer animation was better with details and thecharacters appearance. (ESPECIALLY THE FIRE) But I'd rather actually have more saturation then that! The fight scenes were the worst in my opinion, everyone overhyped the Tartaros arc. And well it was really disappointing, maybe it's portrayed better in the manga. I can only hope. \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\\n\r\n\u2800Of course the characters stay the same its all about protecting your family no matter what. That's kinda the main theme since the beginning of fairy tail, if anything they've grown more mature. Well for the most part, you know in the shounen way of growth. The music is always great in FT it's the same for every other Shounen series out there. \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\\n\r\n\u2800\u2800I did enjoy series 2 for the most part, but I still like series 1 better. I recommend definitely watching season 2 if you loved season 1.",

I was so happy to find out this was untrue- heads up this is just my opinion.\r\nNO SPOILERS - \r\n9/10\r\nStory/Character:\r\nMy only complaint is that in the beginning of the show some arcs are slow. Yes, the arcs are individual and are centered towards specific characters however I was incredibly surprised at how much progression the anime has FINALLY made after finishing the series. I amcontent with the depth that is intertwined within the characters especially towards the end of the anime.  Characters like Gray and Erza grow a lot from their individual experiences. The bond between the characters remains strong through all the sacrifices they are forced to make yet the characters still have their comical moments. I especially loved the way that each episode ended on a compelling note-\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is great! I like how they always made the tones and shades match the atmosphere and situation. \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFairy Tail soundtrack is epic as it fits the cliffhanger that each episode leaves off on. This is no surprise all the fairy tail soundtracks have always been very good in comparison to other animes!\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nOverall, if you enjoy a show that has depth, comedy, and focuses on relationships through driven plot I suggest you watch the show. The makers have adhered to all the aspects that make a successful anime in plot, art, sound, and character development to captivate the viewer. I want more to watch. So excited for the final season!!\\n",

I loved that it is played out in kinda early days but still pretty modern so it's like a mix between an oldschool world and a modern world which you don't see very often in animes. \r\nAnd now for the badpart..\\n\r\nThis anime is very predictable and every episode is kinda the same (good guys are kicking the ass out of the bad guys > bad guys flip the table and good guys gets their ass kicked > good guys gets inspirational power and good guys win) And it's also too much happy go lucky for my taste because no one ever dies so the sad parts when it seems like someone is going to die and they do a flashback montage with sad music in the background you always know that the person in trouble is gonna survive so like i said it's very predictable.. But anyways, if you like animes with magic power and friendship this is the anime for you! \\n\\n\r\nThat's all i had to say, hope you liked my review and please tell me what i could do to improve my future reviews! :)",

It's such a good anime that it's a shame not to have continued, despite the fact that exists ovas that are coming out.

But Fairy Tail (and mainly the 2nd season) was really moving. As for the last episodes , I have to admit that I was really touched to the point of crying.\r\nWhere should I even begin from?\r\n-Sound? :  Both Openings&Endings and OSTs are outstanding.For me , Fairy Tail alongside with Naruto have the best collection of OSTsI have heard so far.\\n\\n\r\n-Art? :  Well , all the characters and landscapes are so well drawn , with such detail. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the story : Complicated but at the same time easy-to-understand plot. Very interesting and well-processed story with a lot of references to the past.\\n\\n\r\nBut what I love most about this anime is the characters  and the bonds the form with each other. Each one of them have their own strenghts and flows , their own drear pasts , but by overcoming hardships they move on. They  highlight the meaning of friendship and the meaning of \"comrades\" and \"guild\" , and they remind us that even if you have fallen into darkness , you can always find the strength and start again.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all , it is an anime I firmly recommend to any of you . \\n\\n\r\nUsually when I write a review I write some other animes that could be related to this , but in this case , I don't think that there is anything that could be compared to Fairy Tail.\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail is a masterpiece and Hiro Mashima a legend!

Fairy tail first got canceled and i was sad, but when they said it will come back after a year i was glad, but omg they ruined it.  tThe second season  animation is beyond awfull, its so bleak and looks like death note, when its not supposed to. before the paus the anime was so colorfull and has so much life, now its just a bland, grey boring mess. i mean there is so little animation in thefights scenes now its boring. its just boring. The characters are all the same but the fanservice is so bad now its ruining it, fairy tail always had some fan service but it was played for jokes, now its just there to appease the audience to come back. The story i have heard is rlly good now but the animation just puts me so off i cant even bother watching it. i reccomend to watch the first half of fairy tail and the never bother to watch the second season beyond the first arc of the season.",

Then, I turn around and see how suckish it has gotten. \r\nIt still has a great story. They can improve the soundtrack. The art was degraded. Really! Why is red now pink and blue is purple? The openings have their ups and downs. They started slacking on the endings. Not that I'm complaining about pinups. But come on...what happened to endings like 3, 4, 8, 10, and 11?\r\nThere's no spunk in it anymore. I'm up to date on the manga. I was gettingmore \"holy craps!\" out of black and white than in full motion picture. It feels like they care more about the story than the actual bringing the manga to life aspect. When I read manga, I'm thinking: \"Aww man! Can't wait til this gets animated!\" Now I don't even bother watching it unless it's a battle or something.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a total lost cause. But I'm very disappointed. I'm sure a lot of people enjoy it. But for me, the anime's kinda going downhill.",

            "content": "My goal since freshman year was the finish all the popular shonen's before I graduate. I've seen many anime's such as One Piece, Bleach, Naruto, Hunter x Hunter, Death Note, ect. I watched Fairy Tail solely because I had just finished Naruto and I thought it would be fitting. At first glance most would think that Fairy Tail is a kid show with a lot of Fanservice. My best friend is convinced that Fairy Tail is crap, mostly because of the things he's heard on the Internet. See for those of who have watched Fairy Tail and hated it because of it's story while thereis no coherent plot line, The beauty of Fairy Tail is all in the adventure. Yes it's very repetitive (But so was the early seasons of One Piece). The minute you stop comparing it to other anime's is when you can fully enjoy Fairy Tail. Fairy Tail is by no means a perfect anime. Hell out of the big 4 anime it's probably the worst one. But even if it's the worst it is still pretty darn good.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nDon't let anybody fool you. The main character is Natsu. While all the character's have specific goals, a problem always arises and it distracts them from their goals. The thing that separates this from most other shonen is that while their goal's are important to them. They put their family (the guild) first before themselves. The show is all about Friendship triumphs all, and if that bothers you then you shouldn't be watching shonen. The story is not perfect, not by a long shot but Fairy Tail still gives you a lot of fun watching battles, the character interactions, and even the romance. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: I am honestly not one to look at the art, it never really affected my love for a show. However the sound. I love the Fairy Tail soundtrack, it has some pretty good OP's *cough cough* Snow Fairy *Cough cough* \\n\\n\r\nCharacter's:\\n\r\nThe thing about this show that bother's me is that the entire show isn't trying to develop Natsu, they are developing Lucy. Lucy has gone from a weak celestial wizard to actually fighting her own battles and standing (Somewhat) of a chance. But even then we still don't know much about Lucy. We only know a little bit of the character's backstory. But I find most of the character's fun and lovable (I hate Lucy in the first 2 seasons but now I love her)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nThis show is by no means a One Piece, or a Naruto. No matter how hard it try it will just never be. I feel that Fairy Tail has a lot more potential to be a better anime. The story telling could be better. The best arc hands down so far has be the Tartarus arc, and that was just the current arc. For those of you who are considering watching it, it really depends on the type of person you are. If you are someone who compare's anime's you will not enjoy it as much as someone who watches it with an open mind. Fairy Tail is not for everyone. But if you enjoyed One Piece then you will enjoy Fairy Tail. I gave the series an 8/10. because I love the story, I love the character's however I feel theres a lot more potential in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading\\n\r\nSorry if there was any mistakes",

The jokes were Funny and the whole feel of the show was just brimming with wonder and energy which made me like the series. yh they weren't exactly that well written but it was quite a bit of fun Until Edolas arc reared its ugly head.\\n\r\nyh the arcs before that weren't that good but the show took a nosedive in Quality after that arc began.\\n\r\nbut in order to begin talking about what really infuriated me about that arc, I first have to talk about the Characters.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the fact that most of the Characters are Members of Fairy tail, The Characters are pretty basic to begin with,\\n\r\nyou have the typica shounen hothead Natsu who is also a Dragonslayer, Eats huge amounts of food, loves to fight and talks all about Friendship. Soundds like a typical shounen lead right? Right and Typical shounen leads also have a Rival so here comes\\n\r\nGray, who often gets into fights with Natsu just for Comedic Relief (Yh the series never took their Rivalry serious like Naruto did), He is an Ice Maker (and Ice Demon Slayer later on) who also seems to be a professional stripper (so good that a certain girls gets wet from it) and a Dancer who can kick Micheal Jackson's ass on the dance-floor somehow.\\n\r\nbut who can stop their Freindly rivalry? Erza Scarlet ofcourse with her Stern attitude, she makes the rest of the Fairy tail Guild her Bitch since she is the Woman in the house who will kick others ases if they don't behave and etc etc etc.\\n\r\nLucy however is probably the most Sane of the 7 main Characters (yh 7 main Characters) and the rest of the guild. She always points out the idiocrasy of the other Characters. However she also wears pretty Brave Clothing (if you know what I mean).\\n\r\nand then there is the innocent Child Named Wendy, who is the sweetheart of the Group because she is basically the Healer of the Group and we must always respect the Healer hey?\\n\r\nBut hey a group is not complete without Cats! introducing Happy, The annoying smartass blue Tomcat of natsu and Carla (YES I GO WITH THE DUB NAMES SCREW YOU DUB HATERS) Who is pretty much an strict and straight Ice queen.\\n\r\nThat is pretty much the Main group called team Natsu.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many other Characters but naming them all here would result into me being a Skeleton behind the keyboard so here are some of the short descriptions of the Characters and it is up to you to know who they are\\n\r\nThere is: the sexy alchoholic, a literally wet girl, a Demonic Model, The overly Manly man, the Gramps, Shikamaru, Shanks, Ichigo and many many more.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is the issue with the Characters then? well to put it simply with 3 main issues:\\n\r\n1, They hardly Develop but maybe if they are lucky they will get Development at one point only to be stale for the rest of the show. this causes the Characters to only become more annoying and boring as the series goes on.\\n\r\n2, The Villains are also veeery one note and anto climactic mostly because they lack any depth and get defeated by the power of friendship. they just go \"Mwahahaha I am evil so i do evil Things together with my lackies who are just there for characters to fight with before they fight me!\", even the 2 biggest main villains Xerath and agnologia suffer from this despite the Hype around them being huge.\\n\r\n3, The Characters abuse the power of Friendship and are Plot armored so much that can even cheat death.\\n\\n\r\nand that Cheating death is the biggest issue in the Edolas arc that also ended up forcing a retcon, Why? because the Character who was not dead was ectually dead at the beginning of the series so it had to be retconned into him/her being missing instead.\\n\\n\r\nthe whole Story of FT is also constantly repeating itself, an Evil Villain group does evil things and Fairy tail must fight them. that is basically what each arc is except for the Grand Magic games arc that was different only to return into the same thing all over again.\\n\r\nAnd that is by far the biggest problem with Fairy tail.\\n\r\nit never Changes/ adds spice to its plot, resulting in the show becoming Boring.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Sometimes an Omake comes out, and they are pretty much the most enjoyable\\n\r\npart of Fairy tail. they are pretty much not the same as thing as the other arcs and are really funny. in other words these kind of Chapters/episodes that are just straight up Comedy are the best parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nbut these kind of episodes are just far to few of sadly.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it all up, The series suffers so much from Repetition that the issues like Plot armor and etc only became worse and worse, making it harder for me to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to be honest, I watched it with joy at first but sadly, now I just don't like it anymore after a while.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nand that concludes my Review, if you want to say something about it like, criticise it (would be nice, makes me better at reviewing) or be Butthurt about it, Remember this:  You can comment to me and see if we will hug each other in agreement or have a Flame war Discussion that makes others want to grab popcorn.\\n\\n\r\nhave a nice day.",

            "content": "Boy, oh, boy. What a ride this show has given me. It's been 4 years since I began the journey of watching this incredible show---from the start of Lucy's initiation into the guild, Fairy Tail, to the end of the second season of this incredible show. Despite myself slowly moving away from anime shows; this one I had to complete. And so, I'm here, writing this review for everyone out there to read, and understand why this show is worth finishing till the very end. \r\nStory: 7/10: \r\nThe world of Fairy Tail is very intriguing. It makes it seem so alive, so rich, yet simplein a typical magical, medieval fantasy world. Sure, its story is above average at best (if you're solely judging the frequency/cliches/uniqueness), but its meaning and journey that YOU, the viewers, follow enriches the experience even more so. At times, it does fall in its attempt to fully attract the eyes of myself, hence why I delayed watching the end of this season for over a year. Despite this, however, I was quite pleasantly surprise on the lore of the universe and what it had to reveal. Especially this season, it's so chilling, yet very awesome to see! Although, the first season had better arcs, the Tartaros one is extremely well-worth to watch. Probably one of the best ones so far.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe studio does a superb job at remastering the drawings to look more refined and smooth. Although, the color palette did abruptly switch during the beginning of an arc to a more 'mature' like tone, but I was still impressed with how beautiful the world looked. Its animations, and design of certain characters (both refreshing and new) made me want to say, \"Wow! That person looks dope AF!!!\". \\n\\n\r\nThough, I do have to point out that the designs for the female characters (especially the ones with the big boobs) are really annoying. I dislike the constant boobies that the animators keep throwing in our faces. Just want to see cool looking armor, y'know? \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10: \\n\\n\r\nI cannot even count how many times I received goosebumps/chills all over my body when a song from the OP/ED or theme song began playing. Every time there was a fight, my skin began to tremble in excitement as the song progressed. For the other sounds/audio, the places of towns, nature, and crowds were extremely well-done. It made the immersion a lot more rich, and I was able to enjoy it 10x more. It felt amazing reminiscing the old opening songs from the first season, and I thoroughly was impressed in the improvement of the songs. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10: \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the character development in the beginning of the second season is somewhat confusing. At times, it feels like the characters just don't even grow or feel so bland. That is, until you reach half-way (around the 50 episode mark) is when the background and the growth of characters begins to kick in. That's when you truly feel like, \"Holy shit, he/she is so badass now.\". In terms of relatable, and interesting characters, I'd say there is only like 1-2 really. [lol] \\n\r\nYou've got OP Natsu, OP Erza, OP Gray, and OP everyone else, which really just makes it kinda question if you should just continue or not because of how ridiculous the protagonists are. \\n\\n\r\nThe villains in this show are mixed. Some are good, and some are just out-right terrible. You'll get really angry when you hear typical evil villains repeat, \"It's over, surrender now\", or \"Oh, my how did you get so strong???\" \\n\\n\r\nSame with the main characters sometimes. (I'm looking at you Lucy) \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nI loved the meaning of this show and what it stands for. \\n\r\n\"The Power of Friendship\"\\n\r\n\"Standing together makes you stronger than standing alone\"\\n\r\n\"Friendship can be like a family\"\\n\r\n\"Blood doesn't always mean family\"\\n\r\n\"etc\"\\n\r\nThe scenes of the show, the comedy that is inserted at awkward times, I really enjoyed. Sure, it takes away of the seriousness of the story and all, but at the same time, it makes sense for these characters. They always seem to be serious when needed, and at times, their personality shines at the darkest hour. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nWhat a damn good show. Sure, it has some really flaws that can be turn-offs at some points, but overall, if you just watch the show to make a connection with the characters, and truly (I mean this seriously) enjoy the story, you'll definitely find the journey to the end fulfilling. It makes you wonder about your life sometimes, and how adventure, hardships, and life itself challenges you in various ways. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: If you enjoy getting goosebumps, love to laugh at serious moments, want to invest your time into a decent story, love having a great time, and most importantly, likes to see great fights between the MCs and Villains (Also bewbs if you're into that), then you should watch this show. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n******* THERE IS A LOT OF DIALOGUE IN THE SHOWS. THERE IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH FIGHTING BETWEEN EPISODES 1-55(ish) BECAUSE THEY LAST LIKE 15-30 SECONDS. IT'S WORSE THAN GOKU'S SPIRIT BOMB .*******************\\n\\n",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\nSelf-note: Maybe revise some stuff later on for a bit extra clarity.\r\n\u2726Story\r\nWell, the main/serious story part of \"Fairy Tail 2014\" is quite good. A lot of great fights, new power elements and their method of surfacing. But main Issue with the story I have is main reason I probably put it on hold. And that would be how non-sensical and disappointing turnarounds happened. It's extremely light hearted good and evil battle shounen. But such straightforwardness  made it a bit disappointing considering how well this Anime managedto create really desperate and emotional situations. But nevertheless story managed to make me emotional quite often even at most silly moments. To sum it up story is an extremely powerful regarding friendships and bonds. Very powerful and beautiful friendships and it prevailing against all odds.\\n\\n\r\nAs well we have more humorous and service filled story act. Which in most part is quite enjoyable, but lack of progression makes them a bit dull. Especially when the main story character strength/growth rarely moves forward as well.  Another thing regarding that reminded me of how much frustration this Anime gave me before I put it on hold. Where a simple reason was that the fights were quite self repeating in not a good way. Whenever they gave you new power or moment of \"power scale has risen once again\". Somehow, next moment it's forgotten and thus being stuck in such a loop made it a tad bit annoying.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that. There is fair bit of tragedy in the story and twists.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end, main story is quite enjoyable and emotional. The world and thematics are pleasant and fun, whereas the whole thing is very light-hearted. It simply didn't amaze me as it used to.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nFirst of all. Music in this Anime is amazing as always. Also the tavern like music of Guilds is also very merry-go-round, powerful and fun.\\n\\n\r\nAs for art and animation. It's good as always. Very impressive magic fights, character designs, creatures and so on. \\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nA lot of stereotypes and a lot of lovable characters. Their growth is a bit odd, but I did get attached to them. Past is for the most part quite tragic.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Overall & Enjoyment\\n\r\nI pretty much said everything I wanted but can add few things.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing regarding Fairy Tail I love, is the fan-service. It feels extremely \"natural\" and pleasant, which is probably how the world itself reacts, presents and interacts with a lot of fan-serice moments in this Anime, which makes it fairly pleasant. There are different types of fan-service there for me. Those that are simply there, but are so irrelevant and non-interesting that you just forget it's existence. Those that force sexual service and ruins the experience. Those that have service and are sexually inviting, which can enhance the experience. And those that have fan-serice, but are so oddly \"natural\" that it's pleasant to see, but you don't really get \"seduced\" by it in dirtier manner. Fairy Tail belongs best to the last type. There are few itsy bitsy \"types\" more I could categorize, but I simply wanted to give an example.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I can mention that \"Fairy Tail Zero a.k.a last 10 episodes or so of this season\", was extremely nice touche. I do love Mavis. Which also gave few answers and another dose of tragedy with a taste of odd nostalgia.  On top that how main story got wrapped up pre-zero arc, especially the post-credit. Gave me basically the following clump of emotional reaction \"why?...noo please...f you\"\\n\\n\r\nI find it extremely difficult to review 2014 fairy tail. One reason would be that when I first watched Fairy Tail first season, I found it extremely enjoyable battle shounen for all sorts of reasons. Now that years passed and I picked up 2014 series, I got oddly tired and exhausted of it quite fast. Whenever I've \"outgrown\" it or simply have become more depressed I do not know. But moral of the story is that I enjoyed it overall a lot less than the first series, but it still remains good.\\n\\n\r\nWant happy-go-lucky emotional ride of powerful and beautiful friendships and bonds with spice of tragedy, straightforwardness and strawberry a the top being service, battle shounen Anime? Then it's definitely a good watch.\\n\\n\r\nNot that good, if you want a battle-shounen with more serious and powerful awakenings and breakthroughs.",

            "content": "So, I'm writing this review as a person who loves Fairy Tail.\r\nWhenever someone asks for a recommendation of a longer anime, I always say Fairy Tail first.\r\nSo for those of you who have heard of Fairy Tail, you have probably heard of some negative comments about this anime/manga. I have heard people complain about FT being too similar to other mainstreams, or the story is random... etc.\r\nAnd I agree to some degree. However, I see this as a positive thing rather than a complaint.\r\nMashima has already responded that part of this work was inspired by One Piece (also an amazing anime). There is nothing wrongwith that. There is no way an anime can be 100% original. \"Oh this anime has a character with orange hair, therefore it was copied from Bleach\" NO. You're being too picky.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it is a very original and unique storyline. For people who only start a bit of Fairy Tail will most likely be confused or say the plot is random, and it may seem so if you only saw parts of it. But this is one of the few over-200-episodes animes that have smaller arcs in the story as a whole, AND works out perfectly. I say this because no matter how many details are mentioned, it always turns out to be somewhat important in the end. \\n\\n\r\nAs a summary, all I'm saying is give it a chance. For people who are new to this series, you may find it a waste of time because it is long. But it is definitely worth it once you get further into it and realize all of the details mentioned earlier are very significant. And to those who have watched a good amount and are still unhappy with this, you can definitely have your opinion. But it's a long story because every bit of the plot is so detailed it can't be explained in one chapter. So I definitely recommend Fairy Tail.",

I went off to read the manga instead of waiting. \r\nNow I can say I am entirely disappointed. One is how the animations for the fights are nothing but lazy work from these animators. I don't know where they are putting the budget but it is not going into the animation. So the animators failed to adapt to the manga. I don't know how they went from the amazing finale battle of the DragonSlayers to some cheap fight.\\n\\n\r\nTwo. Is the RECAPS! The waste 3 minutes up to 7 minutes of recapping previous episodes. I don't know who Idea was this but it need stop. \\n\\n\r\nThey need to change the Key Animation Director. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the canon arc are enjoyable just as I remember them from the manga but the animation ruins it most of the time. \\n\r\nThe Art is sometimes at it's most of the time but sometime it just pure laziness. \\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment not so good ever since the filler started. \\n\\n\r\nOf course the characters is the best part about Fairy Tail!",

The comdey is still quite funny but not as funny as the first Fairy Tail. I got use to the animation and it is actually quite good.\r\nOnce you keep watching more episodes it gets more interesting.I cried two times in one of the episodes. The music is still awesome and I love it!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters still remain quite the same but they should give more background or more personailtily to some of them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOver all, I love it! But they need to work on the first few episodes which I found quite boring until I watched it more. So you should really go see it, it isn't as good as the first one but I suggest you go watch it.",

            "content": "GENERAL - Note: I will not cover anything from the previous Fairy Tail run this will only focus on the (2014) series.\r\nSo 2014 starts right where the first run left off. At this point in the arc it starts to become more and more interesting and picks up its pace. Right from episode 1 of the 2014 run we already start to get a very interesting start to the later half of the arc and is where Fairy Tail starts to pick up.\r\nFairy Tail 2014 puts  its focus on only a few arcs. This can be good although due to this it doesn't feelike as much has been done in the story with only several arcs int he run. One of which is filler.\\n\\n\r\n2014's filler arc is  not very good. The start of it is okay but then drags out and becomes a pain to watch at times. I would suggest skipping this filler arc.\\n\\n\r\nWe continue on with our next major arc which is the  turning point in the series and is where Fairy Tail becomes realllly interesting and good. We continue to learn more about Zeref and our other villains and  in so many of the episodes its just dropping information on us that we have wnated to know for ages and starts to pull the story together.\\n\\n\r\nWe get a back story arc for the guild which is one of the best written arcs in Fairy Tail and is very enjoyable to watch. While it does not directly connect to the currret story arc it is used to fill in the gap between arcs but does not coem off as filler material as it is part of the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - So  2014 is used mainly for character development. At this point our main cast is here and the rest of the 2014 series helps  by fleshing out these characters and giving them more depth.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - THe sound of Fairy Tail is in general just as great as ever. There aren't as many soundtracks and I do miss some of the old OST's but the music still fits the series very well.\\n\\n\r\nART / ANIMATION - So in 2014 the art style changes to be more like the manga. This isn't a bad thing but when this was being done it seemed like the animation itself  went down hill.  Quite often there will be just still images.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - While 2014 does nto complete the series still it continues to progress the story in a big way. And I feel its a very good thing that it took a break since we do nto want more filler like this past filler arc. Even though we do not receive as many arcs there are still plenty of key plot points to make u for this.\\n\\n\r\nSCORE -8.8\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT - 10\\n",

Cursed guild was hyped so hard by Hiro i was expecting hard battles pain and suffering and the first fight was closing in with Jackal vs Natsu, Natsu had some trouble in the beginning but he fucked up Jackal  in the end as expected nothing wrong with that but i was expecting Jackal to be stronger, it didnot bother me much i understand by now that Hiro is sometimes lazy to do longer fights like with Laxus vs Orga ( he builds up hype for fight and ends it in one punch leaving you with big disappointment).\\n\\n\r\nThan this cursed demon Jackal who killed whole Magic Council with most powerful magic users, with curse that can control explosions decided that he will use all his energy and turn himself to living bomb that will kill him and all around him, it will blow up whole city and there is no time to run from it, and Happy decided to sacrifice himself and to take Jackal and fly with him to the sky so that he can explode far from ground and Natsu, and then you see this massive explosion Natsu is crying it is fucking sad even if you know that Hiro was making false flags before you just can not imagine universe where Happy small weak flaying cat can survive this explosion..... AND THEN FUCKING HAPPY COMES DOWN WITH A AFRO HAIR, A FUCKING AFRO IS ALL HE GOT FROM FUCKING TSAR BOMB LIKE EXPLOSION, THIS SHOULD BE FUNNY? THE ONLY ONE LAUGHING IS PROBABLY HIRO THINKING \"I FUCKED HIM AGAIN\", and you are like \"what did i expect fucking Hiro did it again\".\\n\\n\r\nAt that moment i closed the browser and stopped watching it was just to much, now when i hear my friend talking about fairy tail i ask him to stop because i start to cringe uncontrollably,  i feel ashamed that i ever watched this, someone my age watching this anime for children, it is shame equivalent like my parents saw me fapping, and i feel so sad about this anime it had great potential and it ended like this, original universe ruined by \"power of friendship\" so sad i wish someone will in near future copy his concept and do something like Akamega kill with it, someone who will have the balls to kill character when he puts him in situation were character has 10 inch hole in his chest.\\n\r\n Fairy tail is not horrible but i dont think that you will be able to say that it was worth this meny episodes and time you will spend on it.\\n\r\n In the end when you sum everything up bad and good it is just \"meh\" not horrible, not good just \"meh\" but more bad than neutral at least for me.",

            "content": "I rate longer shows by arc, if possible.  Here are the numbers; more detailed explanation below, though I warn you I shy away from specifics.\r\nGrand Magic Games/Eclipse: 8\r\nEclipse Celestial Spirits: 5\r\nSun Village: 8\r\nTartaros: 8\r\nZero: 7\r\nAvatar: 5\r\nContinuing from the first season, which cuts off part-way through the Grand Magic Games arc, Fairy Tail takes an impressive step forward, breaking through its rehashed faults (for the most part) to create a thoroughly captivating arc- segue culminating in one of the most powerful moments in the entire series, contested only by the Tartaros arc.\r\nUnfortunately, the series quickly falls back to its old ways with the mediocre EclipseSpirits arc, but the interest quickly builds again with the highly underrated Sun Village arc, which very effectively paves the way for what the creators intended to be the climactic arc of the entire series: Tartaros.\\n\\n\r\nThe Tartaros arc does indeed deliver.  Our main characters each have a long-standing antagonistic issue settled in quite satisfying ways.  However, it ends with the watcher wanting more due to its heavily cliff-hanger-esque ending.  It's similar to the feeling in Pokemon after you beat the last Elite 4 member, only to discover that there's one more challenger in your way.  But then the game ends without even giving you a chance to fight him.  That's how Fairy Tail feels, but I will admit that it is done in a clever fashion: by swerving and backtracking to the beginning with the Zero arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe Zero arc has a lot it has to deliver; it would be a massive disappointment if it was filler.  It does deliver, and in a quite unexpected fashion, by linking forgotten ends together and allowing us to be content with the established antagonism created at the end of Tartaros evaporating.\\n\\n\r\nThe short Avatar arc which ends the series was inevitably a disappointment, since the developers wanted to end on a cliff.  Props to them for ending the show in the most unsatisfying way possible, but still in an acceptable manner.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the second season has greater highlights and less swampy arcs to trudge through to get to the good stuff.  It was a struggle at some points, and I took multiple long interims during the unimportant arcs, but it was worth watching all 272 episodes (even though I went through some arcs like Key and ECS at 2x the speed on Youtube)",

            "content": "I've already watched and reviewed the previous Fairy Tail series. So if you're interested in that, check out my review! I thought it was a great anime all in all.\r\nFairy Tail (2014) was pretty much the same as the original anime series except it got dark. I mentioned in my other review that I really enjoy light series; nothing too dark, too much to think about, but the Tartaros Chapter was really different. The characters were - of course - still the same, but the plot was something I needed to adjust to. Sometimes I felt like I just really wanted to skip watching andget to the end because it never ended! I felt like right when the plot was advancing one step forward, it ended up taking four steps back! But there were definitely points in the arc that really pulled on my heartstrings - especially with Lucy and the celestial spirits. There was also so much that you learned about Natsu - character developments - that (unfortunately) hasn't been revealed yet. But it really gives you the want to continue watching it till the end of the anime (2018!). Other than the darker sense of atmosphere, mostly every stayed the same, as I previously stated.\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail ZERO (arc?) was a pretty good one too. Most people suggested that it's a filter, but I definitely don't think so. It really begins a new story line - or rather - new life into the anime and where you think it will end up going. It's definitely worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nI still overall really love this anime - even this second series (which, btw, continued the story of the original series). It still gave me intense feelings as I watched fight scenes. It's actually rather surprising too that at some times, it felt like they would lose - or literally be on the urge of defeat - but don't! Which that of course is because it's a shonen - something that I feel like people are forgetting and because of it, disliking the fact that the good guys always win? Haha.\\n\\n\r\nThis is still a definitely recommended watch if you watched Fairy Tail in the past and want to continue and finish the series!",

I liked the 2014 version better than the first version because the animation got SO MUCH BETTER. The characters are all amazing with their unique differences. The sound is perfect and the voice actors are so talented. I 100% recommend this. Please please please go watch it if you haven't. You will not regret it. Actually, you will become addicted to Fairy Tail. \r\n(Side note: I am talking about the 2014 version of this anime. Just to clearthat out I would not rate the first half this good but the story got definitely better)\\n\r\nTHIS ANIME IS OUTSTANDINGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The impact later is tedious, but at this point it is amazing.\r\nSun Village arc is nothing of note, bar the foreshadowing and the reminder of better times.\r\nTartaros is probably the best arc of the entire series, as well as the darkest.\r\nCan't really comment on the final few episodes plot but can say they were great ending for the series.\r\nArt: 7\r\nThe art can be a little off at times. The bright colours of before slowly fades to become a bit darker and less vibrant, reflecting theedgier tone of Tartaros.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for the 2014 series is different to the original, but is just as good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the reason I've watched this so long. Each character has their defining attributes, contributing to why this series is so good to me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe feature that prevents a 10 in this category is the amount of fanservice included within the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "I think that the first round of fairy tail was alright--- the characters were fine, the plot was ok, but there was still excessive amounts of plot armor and fan service which clouded the significance of this anime. When I found out that they made more episodes, I was like \"ok, maybe they will make it better than the first season\" but boy was I wrong. I had to drop this anime after its embarrassing \"Tartaros Arc\" which is just an explosion of cliched anime and insignificant fillers. It physically hurt me to watch this part because they would literally take one fight scene andmanage to stretch it to five episodes, and they try to reel you in with extremely cliched plot progressions? I'm sorry but this anime is probably one of my biggest regrets and I invested too much time into this series when I could have been watching something better.\\n\r\nThe only thing that was genuinely enjoyable about the series was the art. However, the fight scenes were quite bland and repetitive and it got really boring really fast. The whole \"power of friendship\" concept just put on an extra layer of disappointment in many situations. I was really expecting more from this but then again I was also prepared for unsatisfactory results. I used to be an avid fairy tail fan, hell, i used to recommend it to my friends. I started getting increasingly upset though as they threw out weekly episodes of complete trash and I could have skipped the episode and still had the same amount of intel about the plot. It's very messy and downright cringe-worthy in many aspects. I think that fairy tail /could/ have been a great series and there was a lot of opportunity and possibilities to make it nice, but it was just butchered. I'm sorry to all of the fans of fairy tail (i used to be one), but there are so many more shows worth watching than this. If you are thinking about watching this, just be prepared for a lackluster experience if you are knowledgable in what makes an anime good.",

The art style changed, but to me, that's it. \r\nI've noticed that there hasn't been much character development, unfortunately. But still, please watch! Don't let these negative reviews put you down. Actually, well, saying that it's quite slow-paced -- but it has a good plot. You just have to be patient, and wait through it. The plot shalleventually come, and you'll get interested in it.\\n\r\n(Though if you want to go deeper into the plot, read the manga.)\\n\r\nAnyhow, the point is, I still enjoy this very much. I don't think it's \"trash\" or \"just for money.\" I mean, have you ever been a manga-artist? I'm sure that not all these manga-artists do this just for money.

Each episode is just one huge fight after another which became so predictable and boring. \r\nArt & Sound - both are decent.\r\nCharacter- There was zero character development. They would often do flashbacks to create clear understandings of a characters actions. However, they failed to build a characterup. Each character kind of stayed in \\n\r\ntime with no advancement. BORING\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I generally enjoyed this anime. I watched to pass the time however it was nothing gut wrenching. It quickly came and left.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - I really did enjoy watching this anime. Nonetheless when analyze it  lacks character progression. A plot that both motivates and create emotions within the viewer. I personally like to connect with an anime. However I found myself mindlessly watching it.\\n\\n\\n\\n",
