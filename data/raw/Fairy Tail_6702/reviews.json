            "content": "Fairy Tail ~ Another battle shounen anime to join the glorious world of anime. Adapted from the manga written by Hiro Mashima of the same name. \r\nNow before you continue reading I must warn you that if you haven't seen all the episodes or are a huge fan that can't take criticism please refrain from reading this review. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\r\nFor those yet reading this review please keep an open mind about what you are going to read.\r\nInitially I did enjoy fairy tail but in the end i started disliking the series. Here are a few reasons why\r\nFirst of all the arcs are short.Which means there's a lot of things they can't do, bigger story, adventure or exploring, showing more of the side characters, etc. Every arc ends up boring to me and not memorable. The arc size also makes it so predictable. They have to go there without knowing much, be beaten by the enemies easily, get back up and run after them, beat them, a little talk afterwards, then go home.\\n\\n\r\nThe fillers, Fairy Tail has horrible fillers. Like the Daphne arc and the Starry Key filler arc. Just unbelievably bad. ABove that the filler arc is the second longest arc in the whole series. For those who might argue that fair tail has \"less\" fillers let me point out that FT has 38 filler episodes out of a total of 175. That's 21% filler, which is quite a lot.\\n\\n\r\nLisanna~They took a nice little cute backstory that helped multiple characters and ruined it. Brought her back without a good explanation and then afterwards nothing has changed. She barely talks to Natsu, she isn't important in the story. It was better when she was gone. Her being back and doing nothing basically ruins the whole flashback which was supposed to show how much she thought of Natsu, he thought of her, how Elfman decided to get stronger after losing her, Mirajane changed to be nicer, etc.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no training neither any foreshadowing. None of them really change. They were only going to train once but then Mashima said screw you, they're going to instead get powered up in 5 minutes. Natsu had a chance to grow with his powers near the beginning. He learned that he could use his flame to hold things or whatever. He forgot right after, lost a good chance and it hasn't showed up again yet.\\n\\n\r\nNatsu's a horrible character. He's a main protagonist of the worst type, cocky yet can't prove it. Always runs ahead and gets beaten easily by the enemies, then he gets up and is able to beat the main boss of the arc. He needs a power up every fight or he loses, he sometimes has to get insulted until he's angry enough to beat him. Why the hell can't they give him a fire lacrima to use in a fight, he always has to get fire from some inconvenient ways. He even forgave Gajeel after he beat Lucy for like an hour, talked to him all nicely about dragons after their fight.\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't even care about any of the characters. They are contrived, one dimensional, stereotypical and lack even the little bit of depth that the story sometime requires.\\n\\n\r\nNatsu's power is supposed to be unique. Yet, every arc they run into a new dragon slayer. And then they run into god slayers that's powers are even stronger than their dragon slayer counterparts. It's like he's making it up as he goes.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is annoying. Natsu's vehicle sickness got boring when it screwed up his chance to fight, which was by like the 8th episode. After that it's just been used way too much and has messed with his fighting multiple times since. Gray has to strip every god damn episode, they haven't thought of giving him a jumpsuit or whatever. Everyone elses comedy is boring. The only person who ever says something funny is Happy.\\n\\n\r\nThe action sucked, all the fights weren't interesting and of course were full of random powerups and bad comedy. The animation of the fights were mediocre and most fight end in Natsu consuming fire in some convenient way for the plot or getting help from his \"nakama\" and magically beating the enemy who seemed overpoweringly strong till now.\\n\\n\r\nStory is nothing special. Nothing has really changed since the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nOh the time skip. I totally forgot about mentioning that. It was horrible, a 7 year skip. They didn't even let the mains train or whatever. They came back and were easily able to beat enemies that had almost beaten them 7 years ago and had been training the whole time they were gone.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Fairy tail happens to be one of the worst battle shounens i have ever seen and this is coming from a guy who has seen a fair amount of shounen.\\n\r\nWith this I end my rant.\\n\\n\r\nTo those rating this review as \"Helpful\" or \"Not Helpful\" your feedback is greatly appreciated.",

            "content": "Those that are done raging between anime/manga adaptions feel free to read. Those who still don't understand why books and movies will ever be the same feel free to go away. With that being said, Fairy Tail is easily the best Shounen anime to date! Take this from a non-hardcore shounen fan. Granted, i do enjoy shounen as a casual viewer (despite me seeing over 3000 shounen eps) but I stand by my statement 100%\r\nSounds a little bit shallow but please let me elaborate. There have been countless shounen anime throughout the decades. Some lasting a few dozen episodes, others spanning 100's of episodes. Eversince Astro Boy, children all over the world have been enjoying cartoons such as these, but they all had one thing in common, countless flaws. If you are watching any of the big three, you know what they are. Long fights, long story arcs, long recaps, long explanations, annoying characters... basically tricks to extend the length of an anime series. \\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail takes all those ideas and throws them in the trash. You want short, awesome fights that does not last for weeks? Check! You want story arcs that are full of action, comedy, and a little seriousness? You got it! Most importantly, aren't you tired of characters explaining/chanting their fighting moves every time they use it?!?! I'm looking at you Bleach and One Piece~! Fairy Tail takes all the things that makes watching shounen anime great and throws out all the junk that that makes shounen ...well, junk. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, it looks like it is an atypical shounen story of a boy/girl trying their best to improve their skills. Although it has that element, it is all about being part of a team. This team is the mages guild called Fairy Tail. A motley crew of mages with their own unique fighting styles, personalities and looks. There are so many characters in this show, one would find it hard not to like 3-5 characters out of the lot. Watching only 22 episodes, and you will be introduced to over 2 dozen members of fairy tail. Even the way they introduce all of their characters and their powers is awesome. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, such is the case here. It's a shoot first, ask questions later style, which how it SHOULD be. \\n\\n\r\nSince that is the case, less time is taken to explain things you already know and actually put toward story and character development. Another amazing feat done by this anime series... episode recaps last LESS THAN 30 seconds! Talk about innovative! I know purists complain that it \"doesn't follow the manga to the word!\" but really, what manga does? I may sound like a broken record but if you keep an open mind, you can see this series is a cut above the rest. All arcs are told in typical anime fashion, problem arises and the team must stop them. But I'll be damned if you cant get excited seeing all the action and/or comedy that is packed in to a half hour. It will even manage to surprise you in more ways than one! \"Kya!\" Comes to mind. \\n\\n\r\nWith the sheer number of characters, you would think there would not be enough time or story for all of them. But they all get more than enough airtime considering they're not the main four characters. Natsu, Grey, Lucy, and Happy will of course, be the ones being followed the most, but you will see how much everyone else will be in the shot. My personal favorites are Mirajane and Ezra. On the topic of favorites, you will notice there are a large number of A-list seiyuu participating in this anime series as well. You might notice the voices of Ranka Lee, Taiga Aisaka, Izumi Konata, or even Saya Otonashi, are in here. Main or support, the voice cast can not be ignored. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that can not be ignored is wide screen format and overall high production value of the animation. Usually quality drops after a few episodes, but for an anime style such as this, it lends itself on opportune times to use low quality animation over high quality and for the most part works amazingly well. It sure might look like One Piece at a glance but if you compare the two, the difference is like night and day. It is actually a little more comparable to Soul Eater if i had to put a comparison to it. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying this anime is perfect in any way. Theres a little flaws that nit pickers might see like the \"reuse\" of certain animated scenes namely the incantations. Or how the \"quality\" drops in a few scenes. But isn't that the case with ALL anime? Those problems I mentioned are so subtle and minuscule you will only notice them if you're looking for things to hate about watching this show. To be honest, from the first two dozen episodes, there is nothing overly bad from watching this shounen anime. I would normally say its bad simply because it is a shounen anime, but this has everything I wanted fixed in watching a shounen anime. I especially love how they can pull \"random\" (i.e. filler) episodes off of the guild message board and go with it. It almost resembles an RPG in that sense. Happenstance encounters or weird pauses in story arcs to start a different one are rare in this sense. The players are all in their place and we are there to watch everything flow nice and easy. Here's to hoping this will last a few hundred episodes.",

            "content": "Fairy Tail is definitely one of the most popular shounen anime and if you are thinking of watching it based on this fact alone, then I encourage you to read some reviews first. I have one small request, reader. Please try to keep your egos in tact and read the review before evaluating it. We all have our reasons to like or not a show.Thank you. Stay tuned.\r\nI am still amazed at myself that I managed to watch all of this series, but that only indicates that there are some positives to it and I somehow enjoyed it all. What can be said about thestory? Nothing really special, a girl named Lucy wants to become a wizard in a famous guild and after she meets Natsu, one of its members, she manages to join him and thus, they form a team and start on taking missions and embark on journeys. Natsu is trying to find his parent, a dragon who raised him and taught him rare magical skills and abilities based on fire. Although the concept of guilds, which is taken from online games is interesting, it is in no way original.\\n\\n\r\nThe story progresses in arcs with each arc being connected nicely with the next one and the transition between them feels smooth and logical. The atmosphere and the nature of each arc generally remain the same lighthearted and cheerful vibe following the vibe of the anime on its whole, except for some moments and scenes which need to be dark to show the contradiction between good and evil. Although, the story of each individual arc can be described as cliche, you could at least expect the execution to be masterful for a popular anime like this, right? No, they decided to shit all over the place with the word mediocrity, though there are some glimpses of good storytelling and directing in some arcs, but this is exactly what they are, glimpses. Individual elements of each arc are interesting  but the story itself is unoriginal, although how it's told and executed is what counts the most and this show had the potential to be great, but they vomited it all out to appeal to the general public and/or their target group If this was their purpose than they nailed it. Linear, repetitive and predictable storytelling and the use of generic guidelines as in any typical shounen of this type leave no room for the element of surprise for some rare plot twists that might exist.Also the amount of fan service, aka huge breasts for almost every female and semi nudity for males, is staggering at the least. Generally, the arcs are short and leave no room for good development and the pace of each arc is out of place. I felt that some arcs needed faster pace but others slower, go figure. Some episodes are uneventful with no action and on top of that no story or character development of any kind. Dialogues are mediocre and superficial for the most part but there are comedic moments where combined with sound and animation made me actually laugh hard. The blend of action, comedy and drama is mediocre and as I already mentioned \"Oh the potential!!!!\".\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is one of this anime strong parts. For a long running show, it is pretty consistent in quality and is very good. Colors are bright and cheerful which suit the anime very much and they adjust well to the atmosphere and the mood of the scene. Facial expressions are distinct and well portrayed. The designs of characters are unique and suit their personalities quite well which in consequence make them somehow memorable. The only complain I had is in the moment of fight scenes which could be depicted better and in more detail.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part ironically or not was the sound. My gosh it was incredible!!! I actually searched and downloaded some soundtracks of this anime and I usually don't do that. The sad music and ost's in the epic moments of the anime are just amazing. OP and ED songs are really great you will love them trust me.Incredible is the fact that the soundtracks match their arc themes and the moments of sadness,joy,tension,mystery and action too damn well. There were parts in the anime that wasn't that melodramatic but with the right ost it actually managed to invoke from me a sad emotion. Also, I don't remember any misuse of sound, it was just perfect. Voice actors are all good and for the most part, fit well to the characters.   \\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail's characters is another disappointing fact. We are introduced to a large cast of characters who are one dimensional and static. Main characters are flat and underdeveloped. I understand that combined with short arcs there isn't much room left to develop so many of them, but they could at least try. Every stereotype of this genre can be found in this series, from the typical hotheaded male protagonist to the evil villain who becomes good and changes sides and the fact that most of them remain the same throughout the series makes this show even more predictable. It's impossible to be caught by surprise when you expect for them to act based on their generic stereotype and they act exactly like that in any given situation. The villains of the show are equally as underdeveloped as the main characters. Of course, there are some exceptions and we can see  glimpses of good development here and there which are later ruined to the bones. So much good development is so brutally destroyed, that it is frustrating even to imagine the potential of this series. Nonetheless, there are likeable characters whom you will want to cheer for but that doesn't change the fact that most of them are flat and superficial.\\n\\n\r\nThe last disappointing fact I want to mention, is the fighting scenes. Battle system is your typical \"raw strength+power ups wins\" concept. Almost no amount of thought or originality can be traced anywhere. Some abilities are cool, but that's it. The battles are won by overpowering the enemy and no strategical thinking is involved. Superficial and annoyingly tiring dialogues and monologues which ruin the pace of the story take place in every fight scene and I mean literally in EVERY fight scene. I know that concepts like friendship and comradeship are important, don't misunderstand me, but not when they are in excess and feel like they try to nail it in my brain with a drill and on top of that, at the expense of the story. Power levels are confusing as one reviewer stated. There are no trainings but main characters manage to win enemies they shouldn't be able to win like ever. Oh yea, I forgot the power of friendship and nakamas!!! Silly me.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally this whole thing can be summed up in 6 steps.\\n\r\nStep 1: A strong enemy appears. MC's are beaten up by the enemy.\\n\r\nStep 2: MC's yell about friendship and the power of nakamas.\\n\r\nStep 3: They power up emotionally and physically by the power of friendship and random stuff.\\n\r\nStep 4: MC's overpower the villain.\\n\r\nStep 5: No training of any kind whatsoever.\\n\r\nStep 6: New arc. Go to step 1.\\n\r\nWhen an anime can be summed up like this than in my books this is not good at all.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Fairy Tail generally has a vibe of positivity and lightheartedness. If you like characters that seem cool, raw power, mc's that overpower their enemies who rely on their friends and protect each other, if you like good animation with awesome soundtracks mixed perfectly to every scene, if you liked something like D-Gray Man or Bleach than you should watch this show and I am sure you will enjoy it very much. I definitely recommend this to children, as well. But if you are an experienced anime viewer or if you like intelligence, good story, plot and character development, if you like insane plot twists and strategic battle scenes with complex fighting systems or if you want to watch something of this genre but don't have much time than don't waste it on this and watch something like Hunter x Hunter or Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10    \\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n*English is not my native language, excuse me for any mistakes. All feedback is appreciated.* \\n\r\n**EDIT** It has been pointed out to me that this review has an elitist tone, this was definitely not my intention and I don't consider myself to be superior or more intelligent than any of you.**",

            "content": "Fairy Tail isn't so much a bad anime, it's just over-welcomed it's stay. It was a one trick pony that was constantly played until you get annoyed and see the repetitive nature of the show and it's sad because this had a lot of potential to be really good .\r\nStory - (3/10)\r\nThis is one of the weaker aspects of Fairy Tail as it gets daunting and rather boring because there is no real progression, and it becomes incredibly predictable with how it will play out, at first it was pretty fun since the stories did serve a proper purpose and introduced us to some othercharacters but as it goes on, you feel that it's afraid to make changes to the characters so they just write what they know and that's where the repetitiveness comes from. The gags were funny for the first 20 episodes but then they get really old fast as well as the fanservice, it even gags at important moments, you could have a serious fight but instead have a comedy bit in the middle completely ruining the mood for the fight.\\n\\n\r\nArt - (6/10)\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good for a shounen anime as it can be fast paced and some of the magic does look pretty cool but at the same time, the designs of most characters seem really plain looking, minus maybe 2-3 characters everyone else looks really generic.\\n\\n\r\nSound - (9/10)\\n\r\nQuite possibly the best thing about Fairy is the sound as it mixes irish folk music with some modern day sounds blending really well and does match the battles that happen, this was something I am glad they kept as it was something very different from the norm. The OP's and ED's were also very nice to listen to and mainly composed of some very energetic pop music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - (2/10)\\n\r\nThis is by far the worst aspect for Fairy Tail, one dimensional, bland, incredibly cliche and just lacked development. I will start off with the main character Natsu who is to me one of the worst MC's in anime ever. He never develops, there is no challenge for him, he doesn't have any conflicts with how he does things its just 'I'll beat the crap out of you' no matter how evil that person is, even if they kill someone he will still treat it more like a sparring match rather than him losing control and losing himself in the process of it, if he's always going to be this guy who doesn't think and just swings away then its going to get really boring really fast.He doesn't so much get stronger but rather uses the power of friendship after making a speech and wins. Lucy is another character I just could not handle because she was just fanservice and a plot device, she didn't get stronger each time, she just gets caught in a messy situation, screams a bit, summons a spirit and that's it, her character seems to be a key for the arc to go through but apart from that she is utterly useless. Now despite all the bashing of the characters I will say that there are some decent characters like Erza, Wendy, Gajeel and Gray because most of them did get stronger and developed and were conflicted with how they did things but even they can fall victim to lousy progression.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - (4/10)\\n\r\nIt was fun at first but once the story and comedy repeated all the time, you get sick of it and switch to something else straight away, there is no proper pacing and some arcs went for too long that you don't feel as invested or interested any more to care\\n\\n\r\nOverall - (3/10)\\n\r\nFairy Tail lacked a lot of important elements and was clearly confused as to what it wanted to be, it was either over the top battle or a comedy, it was too messy to balance both because it couldn't have the comedy at the right time, I wouldn't recommend this anime because it's fallen to the many cliches and doesn't really bring anything solid to the table.",

            "content": "Story (3/10): Oh god. People praise this as one of- No. THE best shounen anime out there. HAHAHAHAHAHA, no way dude. I swear, the writers follow a step by step process on a poster hung up in their office when creating this. This is what the poster reads: 1. Fairy Tail is aware of some evil people. 2. The regular Natsu, Lucy, and Happy group, sometimes with Gray and Erza, set out for adventure and to beat the bad people. 3. They find the bad dudes, and these bad dudes are seriously bad dudes. 5. A guild member (usually Lucy) is put in danger 5.Natsu attempts to fight them but they are far too strong. 6. Cue flashback/motivational speech about friendship. 7. This will then summon this random \"will power\" within Natsu. 8. Natsu beats the seriously bad dudes that are way OP for him and shouldn't be able to beat. 9. Celebration and breathing. 10. Back to the guild for absolute shite humour consisting of Juvia loving Gray, Gray taking his clothes off, Erza hurting people, Natsu destroying crap or eating, Lucy is making stupid faces because of what the guild members are doing, and brown hair girl is drinking. 11. Return to step 1 for the beginning of a new arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10): My only complaint is the magic. I feel like is could be much better quality. Like, Natsu's flames looked like fire animations you'd pick up on Clipart or something. Apart from that, I suppose the art was pretty solid. Y'know, not outstanding, but just average.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10): Asides the less than average sound effects that is to be expected in all lengthy shounen, everything was pretty sweet. Fairy Tail had a nice OST, good OP's/ED's, and decent voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10): Of the 141 episodes I watched, every character did not change one bit. Even after that, however long timeskip it was, nobody changed. Except for their appearance I suppose. The villains, the villains, the villans... They are so awfully clich\u00e9, I want to vomit. Think of the most generic super villain you can think of. Done? Alright. Yeah, he/she's in this. People just trying to destroy the world, or cover it in darkness, etc etc etc. Pathetic. Now if we move onto Natsu, I have a complaint. Tell me how he could defeat all of these villains. They were over powered to the max... Like at that crystal joint (tower to heaven or something of the likes?), that guy was WAY out of his league, but no. All he had to do was have thoughts of Erza, and he's gold. I can't remember what he did, but I think he merged with the crystals? Either way, it's a last minute power up and that sort of crap ruins series. There are a lot more examples, but my memory is so bad (I'm editing this 5 months after I wrote the review, and even longer after I dropped it).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10): I enjoyed it for a long time while I was still in my newborn anime diapers. I'm pretty sure this was my 4th or 5th anime ever. So obviously, I had no real taste, and sort of just watched and liked whatever I watched. But now that I've been watching anime for a while now, I see that this series is just crap. One hundred and seventy something episodes of pure repetition, garbage humour, and clich\u00e9 villains.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10): Definitely not the best shounen anime. In fact. The worst (very close worst next to Bleach). I've watched every episode and read every chapter so far of One Piece, and Fairy Tail doesn't hold a match to One Piece. Of the 650+ episodes of One Piece I've seen, there has been, yes, MC's beating over powered characters, friendship flashbacks for random \"will power\" etc. But the level of repetitiveness is FAR less noticeable in One Piece. I'm not saying OP's a masterpiece, but it's definitely light years beyond Fairy Tail in terms of \"the best shounen to date\".\\n\\n\r\nAnd then I watched Hunter X Hunter.",

            "content": "Fairy Tail. You had so much potential.\r\nThe story starts in a similar fashion like most shounens, a girl named Lucy dreams of becoming a wizard to join a prestigious guild. As soon as she meets Natsu her life is changed dramatically. In the process she goes on magical adventures, facing enemies with her friends along the way. The first episode gave me a quick preview of Fairy Tail, and along the way I made quick assumptions. Natsu seems to be your generic hot-blooded, brawling-fanatic main character and Lucy felt like another damsel in distress slash sidekick. I know I was making shallow judgments based onthis exposure but it turns out I right. Unfortunately enough watching more episodes I was introduced to many typical character archetypes. One that stood out was Erza. Just by studying her actions and interactions with characters I could classify her with one word, \"Tsundere\". This is not a very good sign when you can summarize characters with one word or in one sentence. For other character archetypes you get the rival (Gray), the playboy (Loki), the all-powerful, perverted master (Makarov), manly man (Elfman), arrogant power boss (Laxus), the fangirl (Juvia), and MANY more. As soon as the \"Job Posting\" wall was introduced through out the plot I instantly knew that this was going to be arc based. You know the drill; the mangaka is going invent and make up the story as he goes along. The fighting is extremely predictable for the most part: Villain Team/Guild vs. Fairy Tail. Mini tournaments are emphasized because of the cluster of villains and heroes. It's usually someone from each team/guild fighting One-on-One and then leaving Natsu or Natsu and said teammates against the main boss of the arc. Side characters usually defeat the lesser villains and ultimately the one to essentially defeat the big \"arc boss\" is Natsu which is incredibly unfortunate. Power levels are quite confusing. For example, Natsu defeats a supposedly powerful enemy like Jellal in the previous arc but then he gets defeated in the following arc by a seemingly less powerful villain. The humor is quit entertaining but that does not account for the mediocre filler episodes. Major character development is yet to be discovered, pretty much everyone stays exactly the same. The plethora of side characters are not worth mentioning because they add so little with the plot except fight the villains in the \"mini-tournaments\" and add comic relief with the exception of Wendy, Laxus, Charlie, Gildartz, and Gajeel. Fighting is quite Dragon Ball Z like, this is most evident in the Natsu and Gajeel fight. Most of the time it boils down to Deux-Ex-Machina moments like constant random power ups directly (mainly towards Natsu, Lucy, Gray, and Erza),\"Nick of the time\" character save situations and \"My magical attack/technique is stronger than your magical attack/technique\" sayings. Did I mention Hiro is obsessed with friends and friendship speeches? With the power of your friends and your \"nakama\" behind you can conquer any challenge in this universe, in other words if you see a villain who is not so pro-friendship they are for sure going to be defeated and be unsuccessful in their plans.  I know friendship is amazing but don't over-saturate it to point where it's obviously forced down our throats.\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail is a great example of an average Shounen. Perfect for people who are new to the Shounen genre but those who are are experienced will be disappointed.  \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Everything a Shounen symbolizes\\n\r\n+Entertaining and Humorous to an Extent\\n\r\n+Some Memorable Characters (Happy, Gajeel, Laxus, Ultear, Mest...)\\n\r\n+Friendly Environment and Atmosphere\\n\r\n+Fan service for both Sexes\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-No Originality \\n\r\n-Plenty Shounen Tropes and Cliches\\n\r\n-Too many Static Characters (Natsu, Gray, Erza, Gajeel, Lucy, Master, Loki... etc.)\\n\r\n-Uneven Character Spotlights (i.e. Too much Natsu, Erza, Lucy and not enough screen time for other more interesting characters)\\n\r\n-Formulaic/Predictable Story Telling \\n\r\n-No Major Character Development \\n\r\n-Dues Ex Machina Moments\\n\\n",

Every episode tries to have some emotional bullsh*t and the fights are terrible, friendship power up > all\r\nStory:\r\nOk, so this is the story of natsu ( lucy ? i dont even know who is the main ) and his friends. They are all part of a guild and go out on jobs. Natsu wants to find his lost dragon but 75 episodes into he does nothing to find him.....NOTHING!!!\r\nThe story never gets darker or something, its just natsu and pals vs other guilds.\r\nArt:\r\nIts good, the backgrounds suck tho.\r\nSound:\r\nEasily the best thing about fairy tail.\r\nCharacters:\r\nHate the maincharacters. Natsu gets zero character development and wins all battles because well, friendship power up > all, right ?!\\n\r\nThe rest of the bunch is uninteresting, lucy is there only to show us her boobs and legs, gray is the same but for girls, always stripping, and finnaly erza which is not that bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe main theme of the anime is: friendship, at first it was cool but after 10 friendship speeches... oh god.\\n\\n\r\nSoooo if you want something that doesnt focus on story or character development ( if you like bad animes lol ) and tries too hard to teach you that friendship is important, this is for you.\\n",

            "content": "This is only my third review, and im am not a very skilled english-writer, but please bear with me.\r\nFairy Tail itself is one of my favorite series. I will try not to compare the anime too much with the manga, since this a a review for the ANIME, but i must note that the fairy tail MANGA is my favorite shounen manga, and i have been following that series for years, also before the anime show started.\r\nWhy people should watch Fairy Tail? well if you like the shoune genre, it would really be a waste if you don't! Fairy Tail have all the good shounenpoints, amazing characters, amazing fights, comedy, and best of all; no long explanations during every fight and every attack (I am reffering to the big top 3 here).\\n\\n\r\nStory: The Story in fairy tail is amusing, but there indeed is not very much plot going on here. Most of the things happening seems rather random. But the story is set up on a group of people in a mage guild named Fairy Tail, where the series main topic probably is friendship between them. With at story like this, not having any special plot actually works. Instead of plot, we have fun and interesting small arcs all the time, which never makes Fairy Tail boring! And we all have to remember that Fairy Tail is still on-going, and there is lot of unanswered questions yet to figure out, so it is possible for a deeper plot to pop up in the end!\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: Here i must compare a little to the Manga (Sorry). The manga have AMAZING art, however the animation in the manga is not near as good. This is also the main reason why i won't give this anime a overall score on 10. To be honest, when i watched the first episode of Fairy Tail in 2009, i have been looking forward for it to air the whole day, and i was a little disappointed when i watched it. worse was it, that from episode 2 and on to episode 15-20, the animation keept being bad, well, the little animation there where! Fairy Tail, both in openings/endings and in the episodes themself like to use A LOT of non-moving pictures, which is a shame, because fairy tail haves potentiale to have some really kick ass scenes.\\n\r\nThe fights lack a little too compared to the manga, or just other shounen series, because of the BLOOD censur (which annoys be greatly! We can not show blood in the anime, but naked girls is no problem!)\\n\\n\r\nhowever, the anime still manages to have some good fights, where the Erza arc was animated pretty good, and so some of the other big fights.\\n\\n\r\nalso, a lot of people have been talking about Fairy Tail being a rip off or copy from One Piece. that is deffintly not true! Yes, the art is somewhat similar and yes both series are a lot about their \"nakamas\" for really, its two very different stories. Try sit down and read shojo, i can find over 10 stories with different mangakas, but with similar art and story. Fairy Tail and One Piece are NOT the same, Fairy Tail is NOT a rip off, DON'T compare them, seriously ..\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail have without doubt the most EPIC soundtracks! It makes you go \"hell yeah, go fairy tail\" everytime the main theme for their fighting scenes plays, and it makes you cry, when the sad themes are played during sad scenes. \\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail also have an amazing Voice Acting cast (In japanese) with some of the very popular seiyuu's, like Happy's voice actor Kugimiya Rie (Alphonse, Taiga, Shana, Louise, etc) and Lucy's voice actor Hirano Aya (Suzumiya Haruhi, Izumi Konata, etc) and my own favorites, Natsu and Gray's voice actors Kakihara Tetsuya (Simon, Amaimon, etc) and Nakamura Yuuichi (Tomoya, Greed, Gai, Ikuto, etc) and there are a lot more amazing voice actors, but that would be too much to list here now. Go check out for yourself!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There are a lot of characters in Fairy Tail, it should be possible to at least find a few you would like. To me, all the characters are very likeable, i specially like our Main hero Natsu, because he seems bold, but he actually isn't stupid or slow or dense like other typical shounen heros are. Also with our characters, fairy tail manage to create some interesting relationships between our characters, both deep friendship, but also romantic ones, which usally is really rare in shounen. I'm sure that there haven't been lots of girls, watching series like Bleach, One Piece or Naruto and just wishing for some romantic relationships to happen. Well i will say that Fairy Tail manages to give you - maybe not fully canon - but surely lots of romantic possible relationship.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Unless you really have a problem with half naked girls and breasts, which you really cannot escape from in Fairy tail however much i wish for it, it should not be possible for anyone to not enjoy this anime! It is just hilarious and funny but still have its good and serious moments, and even some complicated relationships between some of our characters, and Fairy Tail manage to surprise me lots of times too!\\n\\n\r\nI will reccomend this anime to all people who like shounen, or like a fun anime with lots of comedy.\\n\r\nThere might be some girls, like myself, who doesn't find the fan service rather interesting (Yes - boobs, huge boobs and LOTS of them) but i myself just learned to look over it, since most of the times, this fanservice is invovled with something funny, which really just makes you laugh of it anyway. For guys who like this kind of fan service.. so much more reason for you to watch it!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all. Wanna watch a funny, interesting and good anime? Watch Fairy Tail.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you like fairy tail, i would really reccomend reading the Manga too. But that would mostly be because of the fact that the art is awesome, and manga contains blood, which makes the fighting scenes look a little more badass, and characters like Gray, is often drawn very hot and cool in the manga, where he get less epic moments in the Anime. Other than that, the Anime and Manga is pretty much the same, i'm surprised to have watched 119 episodes of Fairy Tail, and there haven't been any massive fillers yet. i will believe there have been all in all 10 episodes out of the 119 which have contained fillers, and that was not BAD fillers, and it wasn't 10 episodes in a row, so it made a annoying filler arc. Also the Fairy Tail anime likes to animate some of the many Fairy Tail Special/Extra/Omakes chapters and put them into the series or create some amazing hilarious OVA episodes out of them.",

            "content": "Action Shounen's are a genre im very familar with having watched more than i could possibly name so naturally i was drawn to Fairy Tail which seems to be the next big \"never ending story\" which as of this review has over 90 episodes. While the premise of the series is interesting being about magic and guilds, ultimatley the series fails to really break any new grounds and throughout the course of the 80 odd episodes i've seen has really left me with a reoccuring feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e1 vu.\nStory\nAs you are probably aware, the story begins with a teenage girl named Lucy Heartfilia who hasset out to become a mage of the world famous guild Fairy Tail. During her search she inadvertently meets a boy named Natsu Dragneel a dragon slayer who has a very fiery personality as well as a huge appetite and is searching for a dragon by the name of Igneel along with his flying blue cat companion named Happy. Natsu invites Lucy to be a mage in the Fairy Tail guild and the two form a partnership along with the ice mage Gray Fullbuster and s-class mage as well as team leader of their quartet Erza Scarlet and as a team embark on various quests and adventures. \\n\\n\nThe story is seperated into many arcs which is typical of action shounen, each arc is quite short, generally 10 episodes or less (although the last two have exceeded this number) with very few filler in between. This is where the feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e1 vu kicks in for me because over the course of the series each arc seems to follow the same basic structure. You have your main antagonist along with his or hers henchman threatening to obtain or destroy something that effects the balance of peace in the world of Fairy Tail to which of course the mage's of the Fairy Tail guild in particular Natsu, Lucy, Gray and Erza are there to oppose them. You may be thinking to yourself  \"hey doesn't the majority of action Shounen boil down to good vs evil?\" but in Fairy Tail while there are some good ones, most arcs are told in the same bland, repetitive, unimaginative and predictable way. To start the main bad guy and his henchman tend to put a beatdown on the Fairy Tail members. Natsu vows to win round 2 at all cost and take down the main antagonist because he is the only one who can and wether its through sheer will power, friendship or some other power up thats what happens and the threat is stopped. Throw in one of the Fairy Tail members (usually Erza) willing to sacrafice themselves before being stopped at the very last moment by Natsu who delivers them a very clich\u00e9 speech. Then add the main antagonists of this series following the same basic pattern of going from calculative to crazed during the heat of battle to finally either remorseful for their actions in defeat or plain forgotten about the very next arc and folks you have a Fairy Tail arc. The lack of significant consequences at the conclusion for most arcs or the feeling that the story is continously building in a well structured manner, doesn't help its cause either. \\n\\n\nThe tone of the anime is very light hearted, there's no blood and while death is explored the lives of the Fairy Tail characters or bad guys rarely feel like they are in any significant danger. Even when its insinuated, you know everything is going to turn out okay. The series is also very heavy with humor and wackiness most of which fall flat as the jokes tend to come off very forced. There is also quite a bit of fan service with girls with big boobs and skimpy clothing which really isn't a positive or negative for me.\\n\\n\nCharacters\\n\\n\nNatsu is your typical dense, stubborn main shounen hero with an affinity for food and Lucy is your weak, smart, sexy female character. Each of the characters in the Fairy Tail guild tend to have common traits or unsual quirks for instance Natsu's motion sickness which leaves him incapacitated, Gray's always unconsciously stripping his clothes off, Erza being a tsundere and guild master Makarov being an old pervert ect. Throughout the course of the series we get a decent back story on the four main characters + Happy aswell as some of the supporting cast. While the series does well to show some of the hardships the chracters went through there really is very little character development outside of this and for the most part there is even a lack of explanation for what motivated the characters to join the fairy tail guild or what their goals are while there.\\n\\n\nArt and Sound\\n\\n\nWhile it doesn't stand out in any big way, the art is clean and vibrant and the character designs are very similar to Hiro Mashima's other series Rave and is typical of what you would come to expect from a shounen series in this day and age. At the beginning of the series the animation was quite poor and there was an overuse of magic circles and still frames but as the series progresses this gets toned down dramatically and there is a notable improvement in the animation. The sound is another good aspect of the show it borrows heavily from old english folk music which really works well with themes of magic and festival that inspires Fairy Tail. A warning to those reading you may want to skip over the openings and endings of Fairy Tail they usually spoil alot of whats going on in a upcoming or current arc. \\n\\n\nFinal Words\\n\\n\nFairy Tail is a series with alot of potential that a lack of creativy, originality and at times pacing stop it from being anything more than another generic action shounen anime. Its a show i could reccomend to someone who is new to the genre, enjoys generally short arcs with little filler, a younger viewer or someone who is a big fan of the whole magic and guilds theme. To those who have already 'seen it all' in this genre, particularly an anime like One Piece, there's really is no good reason for you to be watching this series unless you have time to kill.\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes there will be shows that will make you laugh and cry. Sometimes the shows will raise realistic questions, and sometimes shows will leave a bitter scar in your heart. Shounen genre is the champion of genre when it comes to long running, and it is infamous for its action, and known for exploring an interesting specific topic, whether it is ninja, samurai, pirates or shinigami. Most shounen develope from the Japanese myths and culture, while some (recently even more) decides to tell the story of distant land. Fairy Tail is one of the rare shounens that tells the story of magic, set in moreof European style with guilds and magicians and mage and magic with theme of \"friendship\" and \"victory\". \\n\\n\r\nThe most reputable part of the series is its music. Sountracks are top-notch, opening and ending songs are high quality and voice acting is decent. For most and any shounen, this trait is same. Fancy opening to uplift the mood with calmer endings, accompanied by some better soundtracks, music definitely is a strong point of the show. But how many people watches the show for music? \\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, Fairy Tail is about a magic guild called \"Fairy Tail\". The story begins when Lucy Heartfilia joins this guild and finds how welcoming, fun, anti-evil, powerful, and loving it is and together, they take on missions, and fights other evil guilds. (does it remind you of a ninja village from some show?) \\n\\n\r\nOriginality is not present in this show. Everything is recycled, reused and replaced from every other shounen presented before. Lacking originality isn't bad, infact many great series weren't as original, but what Fairy Tail lacks is a genuine delivery and attention to details. Clich\u00e9s can form a decent story if used correctly, however, eveything was thrown out in the stage, \"we must protect\" \"we always win\" \"we are friends\", lengthy dialouges of why friendship is imortant all are thrown out there, and that is what grabs the attention of sleeping audience. There is no form of suspense, everything is predictable, dialouges are from the third-grade diary, protagonists are typical and not to mention the Dragon Ball complex, you know, fight enemy then make them friends, is present in this shounen too. \\n\\n\r\nProtagonists are loud, seen as patriots (as every other typical shounen), girls are for some unknown reasons portrayed as either absurdly strong and obnoxious or extremely helpless, and villains are agian, your recylced evil guys doing things with no ulterior purpose. There wasn't any development but more like a boost change in personality. One time they are bad and next episode, poof, they are good guy. The change is like skipping steps and can't be called development, more like sudden changes to characters. One time the character is weak and the next scene they somehow are the strongest character with power with unsatisfying explanation.\\n\\n\r\n The most significant things, which applies to most audience, is the character art. Gray stripping, nicely drawn out \"cool\" guys,  and EVERY SINGLE FEMALE has a voluptuous body with exaggerated top. However, you don't see audience complaining, because, there is fan service for both ends, sadly, we are in an era where normal figures are considered ugly and to promote story, shows draw out exaggerated body parts. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, beside that, is fantastic. Details are good, backgrounds are reputable, and the concept of mage and guilds are drawn fairly well. Borders are done well, and there colours are vibrant. Animation for any shounen, as always, is good too. \\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail had a little potential. Perhaps some fixing of plot, presenting some unique character could've enhanced the enjoyment. However, the show borrows so much from other shounen that you can't remember anything significant of it, beside the music. As someone who have seen One Piece, Naruto, Dragon Ball and some other major shounen, the similarity and lack of orginality is too obvious to enjoy. There are even major characters (Gildarts), stroy arcs that were completely taken from other series and inserted in this show, with minor changes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I respect Hiro Mashima's ability to draw fast and draw some good scenes, but when it comes to plot I pity these pathetic plots and characters. From my perspective, Fairy Tail is like those action anime with super fan-service, except there is no nudity, but exaggerated males and females with the given explanation for fighting ends with \"cuz we b frndz\" \\n\\n\r\nIf you're into beautiul females, typical shounen, and are half-wake when watching shows, this is definitely your anime, If you want something serious, deep, and a thrilling shounen, you may run away before wasting any time.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Fairy Tail left a bitter scar in my heart. I have wasted one summer, looking for change, unfortunately, it was pathetic.",

            "content": "I'm going to be continually updating this review as the show continues. Currently, I've seen 20 episodes of Fairy Tail and I'm extremely pleased to say that they've upped the artwork and animation. In the first few epi's, things felt a bit below par, animation was re-used in some fight sequences, and overall gave you the feeling of a resounding \"meh.\" Over the last few episodes, Fairy Tail's animation, it's soundtrack, and it's storyline have all truly begun. Character introductions are over, and the true Fairy Tail of the manga is showing through. All I can say is watch until episode 13 (a half seriesworth) and if you're still completely unsatisfied with Fairy Tail, then drop it. But keep in mind, this is a shounen anime, and sometimes the beginning is nothing like the show, or simply lacking.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail appears to follow Lucy, a Stellar Spirit Mage, and Natsu, A fire breathing/punching/kicking/eating mage who is on a search for his old master Igneel. As the story goes on however, the focus shifts and really embodies all the characters. If you were to compare Fairy Tail's story to any other anime it would be One Piece, as the general theme of adventure, nakama, comedy and climax is there, not to mention the definite similarities between Natsu and Luffy. Overall, Fairy Tail's story is a classic shounen type, but from what they've done in the manga, and how the anime is so far sizing up, Fairy Tail is sticking to it's story, without throwing in unnecessary filler (not just episodes, but the time spent in episodes). The problem with the story section, is that it can be somewhat hard to get into off the bat, but once Fairy Tail enters it's first true story arc, I can almost guarantee if you're a fan of shounen, you'll love it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe one big complaint that comes to mind as someone who has read the manga, is the magic. They've gone with this whole \"summoning circle\" approach, and though I suppose I'm getting used to it, I still know it would be better without. Now, most pilot episodes have sketchy animation. And Fairy Tail is no exception. But what I was extremely pleased to see (while watching the series) is that the animation budget seems to have kicked it into high gear upon the first story arc, and animation quality is not top notch. Don't let the first few epi's fool you, the animation in Fairy Tail is actually pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe background music does a nice job actually, it's upbeat and helps you get a feeling for the mood in general, cause when they drop the flutes, you know something's going down. This is something more recent, but for the first time in Fairy Tail I felt a real union of plot, character and background music to truly bring together a scene. It was powerful, it was invigorating, and very encouraging. Watching the show it feels like it's on a learning curve, starting from episode 1-13. 1-3 it's getting C's in school, 4-9 it's picked up to a B-, 10-12 It's rocketed up to A-, and by 14 I'm seeing real quality work come from Fairy Tail in all aspects. Honestly, if you've dropped this series, I need to say give it another chance and continue watching.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail's Character scene is diffiult to sum up. I'll start off by saying, they don't do a great job of introducing them. They just bring most of them in, and expect you to like them. And it doesn't really work.  Everyone just comes off as being uninteresting or stale at first. But as the show goes on, the characters were developed, and you can start to enjoy them. (This happens around ep. 11-14). After that, you can begin to really appreciate Fairy Tail as the manga has been built up to be. It's running on 160+ chapters, the story's got no problem going for it, you might just have to trust me that the characters start out shallow, but build into being lovable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nHere's where Fairy Tail gets it's points. Once the cast is introduced you get into the story and it's a captivating tail (see what I did there? ;D). I find myself laughing at Happy's antics, Lucy's misfortunes and Natsu and Gray's relationship/overall attitude. The fight scenes are interesting and eye catching, and the story is fun to follow. Fortunately 161 chapters in, and I've yet to see Fairy Tail's story turn for the worse, like many shounen manga/anime fall victim to. So here's looking forward to an anime that can go strong for years to come.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI give Fairy Tail a 9. The story is solid, and it's very enjoyable, and that's really all you can ask. If you want to complain about art, sound, and character, all I have to say is keep watching. My old review said \"you'll just have to trust me that things will get better\" and I'm glad to see that that premonition came to pass. In my opinion, an anime is all about how much you enjoy it, and Fairy Tail is one to enjoy.",

Bleach, Naruto, One Piece) from the very beginning, since those three aforementioned series have way too many episode for me to catch up on, anyway.\r\nI was sorely disappointed.\r\n==[Pros]==\r\n- Great idea.  The setting is very imaginative... but that's to be expected when you're dealing with a series like this.\r\n- Music.  The ED is very catchy, and the OP isn't bad.\r\n==[Cons]==\r\n- Characters.  They are static.  Very static.  To thepoint where I wouldn't be surprised if they could make an appearance in Zetsubou Sensei's class of stereotyped characters.  Gray is just \"rival of main character with running gag.\"  That's all we know about him after five episodes.\\n\\n\r\n- The pacing.  Introductory episodes are usually used to flesh out characters.  The four introductory episodes here are totally pointless.  The characters are just the same people we see in episode one.  I found myself asking \"why?\" to every episode.  There's no reason why these episodes should even exist.\\n\\n\r\n- The animation.  Look at the ground beneath Natsu's feet in the opening sequence.  Bad art and animation is sprinkled everywhere.\\n\\n\\n\r\n==[Conclusion]==\\n\r\nGood concept, but the static characters, mediocre animation, and nearly episodic way to storytelling make for a slow (five epiosdes) and useless introduction that makes me not want to watch any more.",

            "content": "It just sucks the way it ended\u2026\r\nNot that it ended badly, it just sucks that it ended at all. \r\nFairy Tail is, for lack of a better term, your generic shounen. You have a group of teenage wizards running around fighting bad guys and all the while they get stronger as Natsu Dragneel looks for his father\u2026 who is a dragon. Shounen clich\u00e9s come with the territory, and Fairy Tail is no exception. Think about it. If you make a shounen, no matter how you make it, it is going to have some generic components. What makes Fairy Tail so unique is that it isgood in spite of all the clich\u00e9s the plot may have. \\n\\n\r\nYou have to remember something that so many people easily forget. Not every part of a generic shounen is bad, and Fairy Tail actually does a really good job capitalizing on the things we love in a shounen. It has great humor, consistent arcs, short recaps, nice fight scenes, and most importantly nice character development. \\n\\n\r\nThe members of the Fairy Tail guild are an interesting bunch to say the least. Since they can all use magic their fighting styles are extremely diverse. After the first season you will feel like you know the members of the guild personally. There are dozens you are introduced to and you will most likely remember their names because the show does that good of a job at giving the characters a long lasting impression. When something happens to one of the members of the guild it will probably make you sad, maybe even bring on some tears. You won\u2019t even realize you have an emotional attachment to these characters until something happens. It is almost as if you are blind-sided a bit by the connection you have with the Fairy Tail guild members, and you will most definitely have a connection with the members as you will most likely see yourself in one of them. I guess it doesn\u2019t hurt that this anime had an all-star voice cast to help with making you like the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s right; you\u2019ll definitely recognize at least a few of the voices in this anime. The first one that I noticed was the voice of Toradora\u2019s Aisaka Taiga, but the show itself has many more notable voices than that including Alphonse Elric, Hanekawa Tsubasa, Miki Sayaka, and Amane Misa. A voice cast like Fairy Tail\u2019s does not come around often and is something that must be acknowledged when going into this anime. Not only does the show have an all-star voice cast but the score for the show is also pretty over the top. Normally it would be hard for a show to get the soundtrack just right but Fairy Tail managed to do it extremely well. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation should really go without saying. It is extremely well done, and fluid allowing for really awesome fights to be had. The style of the art is a little strange though, and not unlike One Piece it may put some people off at first, but after a few episodes you will find yourself really loving the art, just as you will find yourself loving the anime as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nI myself really love Fairy Tail. I love the jokes that I used to see, the characters that I got so attached to, the fight scenes, the soundtrack, the art, and you know what? I even love all the generic shounen aspects that came with it. If I had to describe the show in exactly five words I\u2019d tell you \u201cFairy Tail is really fun.\u201d Because it is, it is just plain fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m sad that it had to end. \\n\r\nI didn\u2019t want it to have to end.\\n\\n\r\n---BREAKDOWN\u2014\\n\r\nStory \u2013 5\\n\r\nArt \u2013 7\\n\r\nSound \u2013 10\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nOverall - 8",

During her travels she meets Natsu, a fellow wizard, and his mascot pet Happy. Together they travel the world and get into lots of fights, presumably, in her quest to join Fairy Tail. This is, after all, a shonen series, so that's to be expected.\r\nThe characters are standard fair for the genre: plucky, but slightly air-headed, girl, awesome fighter guy who's also an idiot, and a cute mascot pet that explains everything to the air-headed girl. Really nothing here to make them stand outfrom any of the other series from this genre.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the CG from Bantorra, this is probably the cheapest and blandest animation I've seen in the Fall '09. It's flat, has a low framerate, and minimal movements. Background characters are embarrassingly undetailed. Spell effects are mainly just some CG plastered on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't really help that everything Fairy Tail does has been done before and better by a lot of other shows like One Piece or Rave Master. \\n\\n\r\n The only real saving grace of the first episode is that it has a smattering of genuinely funny moments and some nice looking backgrounds in a few place.\\n\\n\r\n'Bland' is the word for this series. Art is bland, animation is bland, story is bland, characters are bland. Inoffensive, but tasteless.\\n\\n\r\nI guess if you really, really like these sorts of shows [shounen] then you might enjoy Fairy Tail, otherwise you can probably avoid it and not feel as though you're missing out on anything.",

            "content": "This is my first review!\r\nI\u2019ve heard of an anime called Fairy Tail becoming part of the legendary animes out there. I've watched it, and to my surprise it\u2019s not good as I expected it to be.\r\nArt:7\r\nWell to be honest, I really don\u2019t pay attention to the art when it comes to anime. I think anything goes well. However, compared to other animes out there, it has a good artistic look.  Very cartoony and joyful feeling.\r\nMusic:7\r\nIt actually has very good music. The soundtrack is epic, sounds like medieval time music, and its good. It also has a lot of classical music, like Can-Can, Pomp andCircumstance,  A on a G string, and a lot more.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:4\\n\r\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of Shounen animes, and well this is your typical characters you find in an anime. Natsu is your average energetic guy who loves eating, and always pumped up when going into battle.  Similar to Naruto and Luffy. Lucy is also your average wacky girl who is very clumsy and not very powerful.  Yet she has a very nice body, like the rest of the girls in Fairy Tail. Gray and Natsu are always competing about power and constantly fighting  with each other.  Finally, Erza is like the babysitter in the group; she is serious, strong, and intelligent.  In other words, the characters are not really that unique. \\n\\n\r\nStory:5\\n\r\nThis anime is about this teenage girl names Lucy Heartfilia whose goal is to become a great mage. On her way, she meets this boy about her age named Natsu Dragneel , and Natsu invites her to be a member of Fairy Tail. In there, they form a group along with Gray, Natsu\u2019s friend/enemy, Happy, Natsu\u2019s pet, and Erza. All 5 do jobs in Fairy Tail in order to earn money.  Its not a very unique or exciting storyline. When fighting, Natsu \u2018natually\u2019 gets to fight with the final boss, and wins epictly, like in a typical Shounen anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:6\\n\r\nI have to be honest, but the anime does have a lot of humorous scenes. The gang is always fooling around, Lucy always wants to get guys attention but fails,  Natsu and Gray are always fighting, Happy always thinks about fish and says the most hilarious stuff, and much other things.  Inside the guild is a joyous feeling. However, this is not the reason I don\u2019t like it. When it comes to fighting, the battles are always predictable.  Natsu always fights the boss, and wins naturally. Also the good guys always win no matter what.  If everyone is in peril, they somehow win by an ultimate attack, or something miraculously happens.  In other words, its dull. The battles are not epic or fun to watch.  Additionally, not a lot of deaths occur. Everyone always survives to be good and dandy.  Not much blood is spilled either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 5. It isn\u2019t exciting and so typical.  The storyline is typical, the characters are common, fights are dull and predictable. A lot of people seem to like it because of the humor and cause it has a joyous environment.  I like humor, but not all the time.\\n",

            "content": "I hate this anime so much yet I cannot stop watching it in the hope that over two hundred episodes down the line the story will actually develop. I now have to take monthly breaks in between of individual episodes so that I can convince myself that the next episode wont be as bad as the last.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nIf this section of the review is a mess it is because there is no way in words to describe how horrifically bad fairy tails story is and I have therefore just ranted for a while about how bad it is as well as I could.\r\nImagine if nobodyever died even the bad guys. Does that sound like an interesting story with high stakes? This is what Fairy tail is. Not only that but every villain seems to have a change of heart and become good or just comes back to be defeated again. Death is something acknowledged as happening in the past yet literally nobody seems capable of being killed from blows that should destroy entire cities.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no plot development, a horrific seven year skip, an overarching story that disappoints at every turn, so much bad filler, people recover strength from fucking friendship in every fight etc.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has got to the point where each horrifically short story arc is incredibly easy to predict. The story never changes it is just on a constant loop in which the heros lose then get motivated and come back to win.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art has its ups and downs (more downs) but is what you would expect from an anime of this size. I have never been disappointed with the art but it has never excited me either.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is made watchable only by its well voiced characters, good sound effects and great music. I still listen to some of this anime's music despite the horrific memories it gives me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe pros of the characters are that they are well designed and all have their own interesting distinct powers. If this anime had been good then I would have been very pleased with the cool way magic is portrayed in such variety.\\n\\n\r\nThe cons of the characters is that they NEVER FUCKING DIE. Literally every character is invincible there are no stakes. They also reintroduce characters that should be long dead and make previous story arcs even more pointless.   More characters are added at such a rate and bad guys convert to good so fast that there are now hundreds of main characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm being generous here when I say this",

            "content": "From what I understand this anime is loved by a lot of people (As it frequently shows up on recommendations and top ten lists) but I'll proudly say that I just don't get it. With that said, I understand the story and everything about the anime, but I personally don't see what people are calling so great.\r\nAs a professional critic, this is where I'd normally explain the show and characters but if you're reading this chances are you know those things already. So going right into, I'll just say that (once again, in my opinion) nothing really works with this anime. The characters aren't interestingor memorable at all (the protagonists can even be quite annoying), and the story is pretty generic. Lucy wants to Be the Very Best, That No One Ever Was(Or be Hokage, whichever reference you prefer) but I found myself not very much caring. She reminds me a lot of Lina Inverse (from Slayers for those of you new-school otaku), she's a young, strong minded female wizard/sorcerer who goes on a journey with newly-encountered friends. Unlike Lina, though, she's less outgoing and pretty much an amalgam of 65% of all other female anime characters. Mild temper? check! Generic backstory that includes a parent dying? check! I also recall that she seems to have an almost identical personality to Natsumi from Sgt. Frog, i.e. the most normal person in their crazy surroundings, tendency to yell a lot and get embarrassed easily, annoyed ny the shenanigans of her fellow protagonists...this all comes full circle when I remembered the two had the same English voice actor.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, Lucy's my favorite character, only because the rest are far worse. There's the hilariously incompetent pink-haired sidekick and the token animal/cute thing every show like this needs. So with characters who are nothing but archetypes and cliches slapped together in different combinations, and shallowly generic stories, it adds up to long-winded episodes stuffed to the brim with bright and bouncy overreactions and loudness, and mediocre action scenes, which I can't really enjoy because I don't care what happens to the characters or how the story ends.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, I'll compare Fairy Tail to two other Shonen-based anime. Dragon Ball Z and Yu Yu Hakusho (which happen to be my two favorite anime). Where YYH spent SEVEN EPISODES doing nothing but developing characters and making you fall in love with the protagonists before getting to the action, Fairy Tail just starts off with annoying characters meeting and a big fight right afterward. Now, I'm not saying every anime should be slow paced at the beginning, but they should at least give us something to latch onto before throwing us in the middle of fast-paced action (which, in this show's case, isn't very fast-paced or exciting at all). Which leads us to DBZ. It had characters and action balanced to a tee. When some new evil thing threatened to destroy the world, we couldn't wait to see our heroes try and stop them (Even if it took like 12 episodes a time) and when someone died, we were all hit in our soft spot (regardless of how many dozens of times they've died before). We just couldn't wait to see the said villains face caved in with an energy-blast. Meanwhile, in Fairy Tail, I could care less who dies, even less what ends up happening, and I\"m just thrown off by the unbalance of the story/action ratio. Unlike the two anime I just mentioned, Fairy Tail provides too many scenes of long-winded action and excitement to get into the story and characters, and is bogged down too much by needless exposition, annoying character-interactions and overall cliches to really care about the action either. If you like the series, good for you, everyone has their own opinion. However, if you're wondering why some people don't (And I realize I'm in a minority here) I hope I gave insight",

            "content": "When I first picked up Fairy Tail, I had heard much hype from friends -- that it would pose a challenge to the big four kings of shonen anime, e.g. Naruto/Bleach/One Piece/Fullmetal Alchemist. After watching the first few episodes, I could not decide whether I hated it or loved it. I gave it a 6 for many reasons, but I personally have started to follow it and hope it develops.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story is one of interesting concept, not over-done in anime right now: a world of magicians and wizards, where everyone has the ability to do some form of magic. At the start, I wasconfused whether Fairy Tail was a shonen or a shojo.  We start off with an adorable, innocent looking girl aspiring to become a great wizard. Each wizard belongs to a guild, sort of an organization that gathers people together as allies (think Squad in Bleach, Hidden Village in Naruto, or crew in One Piece, etc.). \\n\r\nThe story progresses as you are set up with your protagonists being very under developed but having an interesting(at first) plot. Lucy, the main character, is the aspiring girl who was thrust into the guild Fairy Tail. She is quickly taken under Natsu's wing, one of the strongest wizards in Fairy Tail. Of course, given this, Natsu is incredibly powerful and can wipe the floor with any normal opponent, reminiscent of Bleach's Ichigo and his godlike powers. Other equally-god-like characters are introduced to create what attempt to be fair battle sequences, but fail as it is obvious through some \"I-WIN\" method that Natsu and Lucy are always going to win. The one redeeming factor of the story is the little change found in Lucy as well as the occasional good moral or funny scene.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe art almost made my eyes bleed. It was so blatantly attempting to fanservice people it almost made me cringe. The art would go from intense battle sequences, with at least some effort put it, to some low quality form of joke with little to no imagination. The art seemed mediocre at best, being bested by many 90s anime(see: Rurouni Kenshin / DBZ). While older anime may not have been as \"clean\" as a new one like Fairy Tail, the art is clearly sloppy and the episodes made to be a cash cow.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6.5\\n\\n\r\nSound is a decent factor in this. None of the tracks are memorable (see: Lena Park's rendition of \"You Raise Me Up,\" found in Romeo X Juliet). It can be fitting at times, and the OP and ED are not too bad. It looks as though the creators of Fairy Tail actually tried to find some appropriate music and settings, though it cannot save the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nStatic. Static static static bland boring static. You are introduced to the main few characters within the first two or three episodes, and then from there, besides Lucy, there is no development. Each of the characters has some rivalry or funny quirk that attempts to make them seem less Mary Sue, but basically all of the characters short of Lucy are godly powerful and make others worship them. The one aforementioned, Natsu, was trained by a dragon and can utilize fire to deadly possibilities. The line is even said that he could reduce an entire city to rubble...which implies how incredibly unbalanced it seems. Likewise, the characters seem to jump in power from average to within seconds godlike, having a decent battle sequence followed by an overly-powered God-like maneuver performed by a protagonist. The only worthwhile watch here is that of Lucy, who seems to progress and gain some depth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6.5\\n\\n\r\nFor the first two episodes, I was IM'ing a friend saying \"This can't be a legit anime. It's like Fruits Basket and One Piece had a baby which was then hit over the head with a waffle iron.\" But the anime slowly grew on me, regardless of the low quality of animation, lack of character development, or general idea of plot. Being such a shonen sucker, I keep watching Fairy Tail hoping it can at least turn out to be something similar to One Piece, Bleach, or Naruto -- something at least watchable. For the new viewer of anime, it is a good easer into the more intense stuff, but overall I would give this anime a 6.5 / 10, solely for its lack of effort, when it was hyped to be a very good anime and manga.",

            "content": "Story: 5 (Mediocre)\r\nFairy Tail is a shounen anime that revolves around a Mage Guild called 'Fairy Tail'. Each arc in the anime revolves around 4 main characters; Natsu, Lucy, Erza and Gray.\r\nThe first few arcs in the show have varying plots that slowly unravel these characters' pasts. Later arcs have plots related more-so to the guild's history, but the show never fails to ruin a good plot with the addition of random bad guys used purely for battle-scenes, so characters can power up with the power of friendship. yay. \r\nAnother downfall to the story of Fairy Tail is that is had no direction it ismoving in. Okay, so Natsu has his ultimate goal to find his trainer and guardian Igneel -  the dragon that raised him and taught him Dragon Slayer magic - but the anime is over 150 episodes long and we haven't seen even the slightest trace of a dragon. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 (Fair)\\n\r\nThe art and animation are also very average, but they do increase in quality as the show progresses. The show is a very colourful and vibrant one, with settings that are always very visually appealing, and characters that have nice attire and yes, the good ol' anime hairstyles we've all come to kow and love.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I gave the Art category a 6 is because the animation of characters is hardly ever fluid, even in fight scenes, the frame rate skips, the punches aren't actually punching, they are just posing in front of diagonal lines... It's just, for an anime that has so much fighting, I expect good quality animation, and it's simply not there (don't get me wrong, there are some good fights, but they are scarce).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 (Great)\\n\r\nFinally, something Fairy Tail has that I find are lacking in other shounens; a good soundtrack!\\n\\n\r\nI believe there are three soundtracks released to date and they are what make the many prevalent fight scenes so damn epic. I would not have watched Fairy Tail past the first few arcs if there wasn't some awesome electric guitar riff going on while Natsu was punching his way to victory. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5 (Mediocre)\\n\r\nThe story and the characters are a crucial part of a shounen, and should come second to nothing. The main characters in Fairy Tale are given a whole lot of backstory, terrible pasts, shock twists etc etc.\\n\r\nMost character's pasts are cliche and overly dramatic, and these only apply to our main 4 protagonists, and a few side characters (The Elfman, Lisanna, Mirajane trio for example).\\n\\n\r\nAnother downfall for characters is that they remain very static throughout the show, and hardly ever budge from their niche. What I mean by this is that every character's past defines who they are in the show, and who they pretty much always will be. There are no moments in the show that change the characters behaviour hardly at all, and I find that very unfortunate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 (Good)\\n\r\nObviously there was something that made me gat over 100 episodes into this show. That my friends, was purely because I enjoyed myself.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in the show is a major highlight, with crazy characters, funny one-liners and silly situations all mixed into one another to make us laugh and smile. And that's what Fairy Tail is; it's fun! Sure it is serious when it needs to be, but you can always count on someone to brighten up the mood almost instantly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 (Fair)\\n\r\nOkay, so there's the final verdict; a solid 6. Fairy Tail is a shounen anime that shines in its comedy, its soundtrack and a few decent fights along the way, but it lacks in unique and original story and plot, character development, and animation at times. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are just starting off on anime, its a great gateway anime, but if you're a seasoned anime fan, there are better shounens out there, and there are better comedic shows out there, so its not really worth the length the show goes for (with no end in sight as of yet).",

            "content": "Fairy Tail ~ Another battle shounen anime to join the glorious world of anime. Adapted from the manga written by Hiro Mashima of the same name. \r\nNow before you continue reading I must warn you that if you haven't seen all the episodes or are a huge fan that can't take criticism please refrain from reading this review. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\r\nFor those yet reading this review please keep an open mind about what you are going to read.\r\nInitially I did enjoy fairy tail but in the end i started disliking the series. Here are a few reasons why\r\nFirst of all the arcs are short.Which means there's a lot of things they can't do, bigger story, adventure or exploring, showing more of the side characters, etc. Every arc ends up boring to me and not memorable. The arc size also makes it so predictable. They have to go there without knowing much, be beaten by the enemies easily, get back up and run after them, beat them, a little talk afterwards, then go home.\\n\\n\r\nThe fillers, Fairy Tail has horrible fillers. Like the Daphne arc and the Starry Key filler arc. Just unbelievably bad. ABove that the filler arc is the second longest arc in the whole series. For those who might argue that fair tail has \"less\" fillers let me point out that FT has 38 filler episodes out of a total of 175. That's 21% filler, which is quite a lot.\\n\\n\r\nLisanna~They took a nice little cute backstory that helped multiple characters and ruined it. Brought her back without a good explanation and then afterwards nothing has changed. She barely talks to Natsu, she isn't important in the story. It was better when she was gone. Her being back and doing nothing basically ruins the whole flashback which was supposed to show how much she thought of Natsu, he thought of her, how Elfman decided to get stronger after losing her, Mirajane changed to be nicer, etc.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no training neither any foreshadowing. None of them really change. They were only going to train once but then Mashima said screw you, they're going to instead get powered up in 5 minutes. Natsu had a chance to grow with his powers near the beginning. He learned that he could use his flame to hold things or whatever. He forgot right after, lost a good chance and it hasn't showed up again yet.\\n\\n\r\nNatsu's a horrible character. He's a main protagonist of the worst type, cocky yet can't prove it. Always runs ahead and gets beaten easily by the enemies, then he gets up and is able to beat the main boss of the arc. He needs a power up every fight or he loses, he sometimes has to get insulted until he's angry enough to beat him. Why the hell can't they give him a fire lacrima to use in a fight, he always has to get fire from some inconvenient ways. He even forgave Gajeel after he beat Lucy for like an hour, talked to him all nicely about dragons after their fight.\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't even care about any of the characters. They are contrived, one dimensional, stereotypical and lack even the little bit of depth that the story sometime requires.\\n\\n\r\nNatsu's power is supposed to be unique. Yet, every arc they run into a new dragon slayer. And then they run into god slayers that's powers are even stronger than their dragon slayer counterparts. It's like he's making it up as he goes.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is annoying. Natsu's vehicle sickness got boring when it screwed up his chance to fight, which was by like the 8th episode. After that it's just been used way too much and has messed with his fighting multiple times since. Gray has to strip every god damn episode, they haven't thought of giving him a jumpsuit or whatever. Everyone elses comedy is boring. The only person who ever says something funny is Happy.\\n\\n\r\nThe action sucked, all the fights weren't interesting and of course were full of random powerups and bad comedy. The animation of the fights were mediocre and most fight end in Natsu consuming fire in some convenient way for the plot or getting help from his \"nakama\" and magically beating the enemy who seemed overpoweringly strong till now.\\n\\n\r\nStory is nothing special. Nothing has really changed since the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nOh the time skip. I totally forgot about mentioning that. It was horrible, a 7 year skip. They didn't even let the mains train or whatever. They came back and were easily able to beat enemies that had almost beaten them 7 years ago and had been training the whole time they were gone.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Fairy tail happens to be one of the worst battle shounens i have ever seen and this is coming from a guy who has seen a fair amount of shounen.\\n\r\nWith this I end my rant.\\n\\n\r\nTo those rating this review as \"Helpful\" or \"Not Helpful\" your feedback is greatly appreciated.",

            "content": "Those that are done raging between anime/manga adaptions feel free to read. Those who still don't understand why books and movies will ever be the same feel free to go away. With that being said, Fairy Tail is easily the best Shounen anime to date! Take this from a non-hardcore shounen fan. Granted, i do enjoy shounen as a casual viewer (despite me seeing over 3000 shounen eps) but I stand by my statement 100%\r\nSounds a little bit shallow but please let me elaborate. There have been countless shounen anime throughout the decades. Some lasting a few dozen episodes, others spanning 100's of episodes. Eversince Astro Boy, children all over the world have been enjoying cartoons such as these, but they all had one thing in common, countless flaws. If you are watching any of the big three, you know what they are. Long fights, long story arcs, long recaps, long explanations, annoying characters... basically tricks to extend the length of an anime series. \\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail takes all those ideas and throws them in the trash. You want short, awesome fights that does not last for weeks? Check! You want story arcs that are full of action, comedy, and a little seriousness? You got it! Most importantly, aren't you tired of characters explaining/chanting their fighting moves every time they use it?!?! I'm looking at you Bleach and One Piece~! Fairy Tail takes all the things that makes watching shounen anime great and throws out all the junk that that makes shounen ...well, junk. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, it looks like it is an atypical shounen story of a boy/girl trying their best to improve their skills. Although it has that element, it is all about being part of a team. This team is the mages guild called Fairy Tail. A motley crew of mages with their own unique fighting styles, personalities and looks. There are so many characters in this show, one would find it hard not to like 3-5 characters out of the lot. Watching only 22 episodes, and you will be introduced to over 2 dozen members of fairy tail. Even the way they introduce all of their characters and their powers is awesome. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, such is the case here. It's a shoot first, ask questions later style, which how it SHOULD be. \\n\\n\r\nSince that is the case, less time is taken to explain things you already know and actually put toward story and character development. Another amazing feat done by this anime series... episode recaps last LESS THAN 30 seconds! Talk about innovative! I know purists complain that it \"doesn't follow the manga to the word!\" but really, what manga does? I may sound like a broken record but if you keep an open mind, you can see this series is a cut above the rest. All arcs are told in typical anime fashion, problem arises and the team must stop them. But I'll be damned if you cant get excited seeing all the action and/or comedy that is packed in to a half hour. It will even manage to surprise you in more ways than one! \"Kya!\" Comes to mind. \\n\\n\r\nWith the sheer number of characters, you would think there would not be enough time or story for all of them. But they all get more than enough airtime considering they're not the main four characters. Natsu, Grey, Lucy, and Happy will of course, be the ones being followed the most, but you will see how much everyone else will be in the shot. My personal favorites are Mirajane and Ezra. On the topic of favorites, you will notice there are a large number of A-list seiyuu participating in this anime series as well. You might notice the voices of Ranka Lee, Taiga Aisaka, Izumi Konata, or even Saya Otonashi, are in here. Main or support, the voice cast can not be ignored. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that can not be ignored is wide screen format and overall high production value of the animation. Usually quality drops after a few episodes, but for an anime style such as this, it lends itself on opportune times to use low quality animation over high quality and for the most part works amazingly well. It sure might look like One Piece at a glance but if you compare the two, the difference is like night and day. It is actually a little more comparable to Soul Eater if i had to put a comparison to it. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying this anime is perfect in any way. Theres a little flaws that nit pickers might see like the \"reuse\" of certain animated scenes namely the incantations. Or how the \"quality\" drops in a few scenes. But isn't that the case with ALL anime? Those problems I mentioned are so subtle and minuscule you will only notice them if you're looking for things to hate about watching this show. To be honest, from the first two dozen episodes, there is nothing overly bad from watching this shounen anime. I would normally say its bad simply because it is a shounen anime, but this has everything I wanted fixed in watching a shounen anime. I especially love how they can pull \"random\" (i.e. filler) episodes off of the guild message board and go with it. It almost resembles an RPG in that sense. Happenstance encounters or weird pauses in story arcs to start a different one are rare in this sense. The players are all in their place and we are there to watch everything flow nice and easy. Here's to hoping this will last a few hundred episodes.",

            "content": "Fairy Tail is definitely one of the most popular shounen anime and if you are thinking of watching it based on this fact alone, then I encourage you to read some reviews first. I have one small request, reader. Please try to keep your egos in tact and read the review before evaluating it. We all have our reasons to like or not a show.Thank you. Stay tuned.\r\nI am still amazed at myself that I managed to watch all of this series, but that only indicates that there are some positives to it and I somehow enjoyed it all. What can be said about thestory? Nothing really special, a girl named Lucy wants to become a wizard in a famous guild and after she meets Natsu, one of its members, she manages to join him and thus, they form a team and start on taking missions and embark on journeys. Natsu is trying to find his parent, a dragon who raised him and taught him rare magical skills and abilities based on fire. Although the concept of guilds, which is taken from online games is interesting, it is in no way original.\\n\\n\r\nThe story progresses in arcs with each arc being connected nicely with the next one and the transition between them feels smooth and logical. The atmosphere and the nature of each arc generally remain the same lighthearted and cheerful vibe following the vibe of the anime on its whole, except for some moments and scenes which need to be dark to show the contradiction between good and evil. Although, the story of each individual arc can be described as cliche, you could at least expect the execution to be masterful for a popular anime like this, right? No, they decided to shit all over the place with the word mediocrity, though there are some glimpses of good storytelling and directing in some arcs, but this is exactly what they are, glimpses. Individual elements of each arc are interesting  but the story itself is unoriginal, although how it's told and executed is what counts the most and this show had the potential to be great, but they vomited it all out to appeal to the general public and/or their target group If this was their purpose than they nailed it. Linear, repetitive and predictable storytelling and the use of generic guidelines as in any typical shounen of this type leave no room for the element of surprise for some rare plot twists that might exist.Also the amount of fan service, aka huge breasts for almost every female and semi nudity for males, is staggering at the least. Generally, the arcs are short and leave no room for good development and the pace of each arc is out of place. I felt that some arcs needed faster pace but others slower, go figure. Some episodes are uneventful with no action and on top of that no story or character development of any kind. Dialogues are mediocre and superficial for the most part but there are comedic moments where combined with sound and animation made me actually laugh hard. The blend of action, comedy and drama is mediocre and as I already mentioned \"Oh the potential!!!!\".\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is one of this anime strong parts. For a long running show, it is pretty consistent in quality and is very good. Colors are bright and cheerful which suit the anime very much and they adjust well to the atmosphere and the mood of the scene. Facial expressions are distinct and well portrayed. The designs of characters are unique and suit their personalities quite well which in consequence make them somehow memorable. The only complain I had is in the moment of fight scenes which could be depicted better and in more detail.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part ironically or not was the sound. My gosh it was incredible!!! I actually searched and downloaded some soundtracks of this anime and I usually don't do that. The sad music and ost's in the epic moments of the anime are just amazing. OP and ED songs are really great you will love them trust me.Incredible is the fact that the soundtracks match their arc themes and the moments of sadness,joy,tension,mystery and action too damn well. There were parts in the anime that wasn't that melodramatic but with the right ost it actually managed to invoke from me a sad emotion. Also, I don't remember any misuse of sound, it was just perfect. Voice actors are all good and for the most part, fit well to the characters.   \\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail's characters is another disappointing fact. We are introduced to a large cast of characters who are one dimensional and static. Main characters are flat and underdeveloped. I understand that combined with short arcs there isn't much room left to develop so many of them, but they could at least try. Every stereotype of this genre can be found in this series, from the typical hotheaded male protagonist to the evil villain who becomes good and changes sides and the fact that most of them remain the same throughout the series makes this show even more predictable. It's impossible to be caught by surprise when you expect for them to act based on their generic stereotype and they act exactly like that in any given situation. The villains of the show are equally as underdeveloped as the main characters. Of course, there are some exceptions and we can see  glimpses of good development here and there which are later ruined to the bones. So much good development is so brutally destroyed, that it is frustrating even to imagine the potential of this series. Nonetheless, there are likeable characters whom you will want to cheer for but that doesn't change the fact that most of them are flat and superficial.\\n\\n\r\nThe last disappointing fact I want to mention, is the fighting scenes. Battle system is your typical \"raw strength+power ups wins\" concept. Almost no amount of thought or originality can be traced anywhere. Some abilities are cool, but that's it. The battles are won by overpowering the enemy and no strategical thinking is involved. Superficial and annoyingly tiring dialogues and monologues which ruin the pace of the story take place in every fight scene and I mean literally in EVERY fight scene. I know that concepts like friendship and comradeship are important, don't misunderstand me, but not when they are in excess and feel like they try to nail it in my brain with a drill and on top of that, at the expense of the story. Power levels are confusing as one reviewer stated. There are no trainings but main characters manage to win enemies they shouldn't be able to win like ever. Oh yea, I forgot the power of friendship and nakamas!!! Silly me.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally this whole thing can be summed up in 6 steps.\\n\r\nStep 1: A strong enemy appears. MC's are beaten up by the enemy.\\n\r\nStep 2: MC's yell about friendship and the power of nakamas.\\n\r\nStep 3: They power up emotionally and physically by the power of friendship and random stuff.\\n\r\nStep 4: MC's overpower the villain.\\n\r\nStep 5: No training of any kind whatsoever.\\n\r\nStep 6: New arc. Go to step 1.\\n\r\nWhen an anime can be summed up like this than in my books this is not good at all.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Fairy Tail generally has a vibe of positivity and lightheartedness. If you like characters that seem cool, raw power, mc's that overpower their enemies who rely on their friends and protect each other, if you like good animation with awesome soundtracks mixed perfectly to every scene, if you liked something like D-Gray Man or Bleach than you should watch this show and I am sure you will enjoy it very much. I definitely recommend this to children, as well. But if you are an experienced anime viewer or if you like intelligence, good story, plot and character development, if you like insane plot twists and strategic battle scenes with complex fighting systems or if you want to watch something of this genre but don't have much time than don't waste it on this and watch something like Hunter x Hunter or Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10    \\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n*English is not my native language, excuse me for any mistakes. All feedback is appreciated.* \\n\r\n**EDIT** It has been pointed out to me that this review has an elitist tone, this was definitely not my intention and I don't consider myself to be superior or more intelligent than any of you.**",

            "content": "Fairy Tail isn't so much a bad anime, it's just over-welcomed it's stay. It was a one trick pony that was constantly played until you get annoyed and see the repetitive nature of the show and it's sad because this had a lot of potential to be really good .\r\nStory - (3/10)\r\nThis is one of the weaker aspects of Fairy Tail as it gets daunting and rather boring because there is no real progression, and it becomes incredibly predictable with how it will play out, at first it was pretty fun since the stories did serve a proper purpose and introduced us to some othercharacters but as it goes on, you feel that it's afraid to make changes to the characters so they just write what they know and that's where the repetitiveness comes from. The gags were funny for the first 20 episodes but then they get really old fast as well as the fanservice, it even gags at important moments, you could have a serious fight but instead have a comedy bit in the middle completely ruining the mood for the fight.\\n\\n\r\nArt - (6/10)\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good for a shounen anime as it can be fast paced and some of the magic does look pretty cool but at the same time, the designs of most characters seem really plain looking, minus maybe 2-3 characters everyone else looks really generic.\\n\\n\r\nSound - (9/10)\\n\r\nQuite possibly the best thing about Fairy is the sound as it mixes irish folk music with some modern day sounds blending really well and does match the battles that happen, this was something I am glad they kept as it was something very different from the norm. The OP's and ED's were also very nice to listen to and mainly composed of some very energetic pop music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - (2/10)\\n\r\nThis is by far the worst aspect for Fairy Tail, one dimensional, bland, incredibly cliche and just lacked development. I will start off with the main character Natsu who is to me one of the worst MC's in anime ever. He never develops, there is no challenge for him, he doesn't have any conflicts with how he does things its just 'I'll beat the crap out of you' no matter how evil that person is, even if they kill someone he will still treat it more like a sparring match rather than him losing control and losing himself in the process of it, if he's always going to be this guy who doesn't think and just swings away then its going to get really boring really fast.He doesn't so much get stronger but rather uses the power of friendship after making a speech and wins. Lucy is another character I just could not handle because she was just fanservice and a plot device, she didn't get stronger each time, she just gets caught in a messy situation, screams a bit, summons a spirit and that's it, her character seems to be a key for the arc to go through but apart from that she is utterly useless. Now despite all the bashing of the characters I will say that there are some decent characters like Erza, Wendy, Gajeel and Gray because most of them did get stronger and developed and were conflicted with how they did things but even they can fall victim to lousy progression.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - (4/10)\\n\r\nIt was fun at first but once the story and comedy repeated all the time, you get sick of it and switch to something else straight away, there is no proper pacing and some arcs went for too long that you don't feel as invested or interested any more to care\\n\\n\r\nOverall - (3/10)\\n\r\nFairy Tail lacked a lot of important elements and was clearly confused as to what it wanted to be, it was either over the top battle or a comedy, it was too messy to balance both because it couldn't have the comedy at the right time, I wouldn't recommend this anime because it's fallen to the many cliches and doesn't really bring anything solid to the table.",

            "content": "Story (3/10): Oh god. People praise this as one of- No. THE best shounen anime out there. HAHAHAHAHAHA, no way dude. I swear, the writers follow a step by step process on a poster hung up in their office when creating this. This is what the poster reads: 1. Fairy Tail is aware of some evil people. 2. The regular Natsu, Lucy, and Happy group, sometimes with Gray and Erza, set out for adventure and to beat the bad people. 3. They find the bad dudes, and these bad dudes are seriously bad dudes. 5. A guild member (usually Lucy) is put in danger 5.Natsu attempts to fight them but they are far too strong. 6. Cue flashback/motivational speech about friendship. 7. This will then summon this random \"will power\" within Natsu. 8. Natsu beats the seriously bad dudes that are way OP for him and shouldn't be able to beat. 9. Celebration and breathing. 10. Back to the guild for absolute shite humour consisting of Juvia loving Gray, Gray taking his clothes off, Erza hurting people, Natsu destroying crap or eating, Lucy is making stupid faces because of what the guild members are doing, and brown hair girl is drinking. 11. Return to step 1 for the beginning of a new arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10): My only complaint is the magic. I feel like is could be much better quality. Like, Natsu's flames looked like fire animations you'd pick up on Clipart or something. Apart from that, I suppose the art was pretty solid. Y'know, not outstanding, but just average.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10): Asides the less than average sound effects that is to be expected in all lengthy shounen, everything was pretty sweet. Fairy Tail had a nice OST, good OP's/ED's, and decent voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10): Of the 141 episodes I watched, every character did not change one bit. Even after that, however long timeskip it was, nobody changed. Except for their appearance I suppose. The villains, the villains, the villans... They are so awfully clich\u00e9, I want to vomit. Think of the most generic super villain you can think of. Done? Alright. Yeah, he/she's in this. People just trying to destroy the world, or cover it in darkness, etc etc etc. Pathetic. Now if we move onto Natsu, I have a complaint. Tell me how he could defeat all of these villains. They were over powered to the max... Like at that crystal joint (tower to heaven or something of the likes?), that guy was WAY out of his league, but no. All he had to do was have thoughts of Erza, and he's gold. I can't remember what he did, but I think he merged with the crystals? Either way, it's a last minute power up and that sort of crap ruins series. There are a lot more examples, but my memory is so bad (I'm editing this 5 months after I wrote the review, and even longer after I dropped it).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10): I enjoyed it for a long time while I was still in my newborn anime diapers. I'm pretty sure this was my 4th or 5th anime ever. So obviously, I had no real taste, and sort of just watched and liked whatever I watched. But now that I've been watching anime for a while now, I see that this series is just crap. One hundred and seventy something episodes of pure repetition, garbage humour, and clich\u00e9 villains.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10): Definitely not the best shounen anime. In fact. The worst (very close worst next to Bleach). I've watched every episode and read every chapter so far of One Piece, and Fairy Tail doesn't hold a match to One Piece. Of the 650+ episodes of One Piece I've seen, there has been, yes, MC's beating over powered characters, friendship flashbacks for random \"will power\" etc. But the level of repetitiveness is FAR less noticeable in One Piece. I'm not saying OP's a masterpiece, but it's definitely light years beyond Fairy Tail in terms of \"the best shounen to date\".\\n\\n\r\nAnd then I watched Hunter X Hunter.",

            "content": "Fairy Tail. You had so much potential.\r\nThe story starts in a similar fashion like most shounens, a girl named Lucy dreams of becoming a wizard to join a prestigious guild. As soon as she meets Natsu her life is changed dramatically. In the process she goes on magical adventures, facing enemies with her friends along the way. The first episode gave me a quick preview of Fairy Tail, and along the way I made quick assumptions. Natsu seems to be your generic hot-blooded, brawling-fanatic main character and Lucy felt like another damsel in distress slash sidekick. I know I was making shallow judgments based onthis exposure but it turns out I right. Unfortunately enough watching more episodes I was introduced to many typical character archetypes. One that stood out was Erza. Just by studying her actions and interactions with characters I could classify her with one word, \"Tsundere\". This is not a very good sign when you can summarize characters with one word or in one sentence. For other character archetypes you get the rival (Gray), the playboy (Loki), the all-powerful, perverted master (Makarov), manly man (Elfman), arrogant power boss (Laxus), the fangirl (Juvia), and MANY more. As soon as the \"Job Posting\" wall was introduced through out the plot I instantly knew that this was going to be arc based. You know the drill; the mangaka is going invent and make up the story as he goes along. The fighting is extremely predictable for the most part: Villain Team/Guild vs. Fairy Tail. Mini tournaments are emphasized because of the cluster of villains and heroes. It's usually someone from each team/guild fighting One-on-One and then leaving Natsu or Natsu and said teammates against the main boss of the arc. Side characters usually defeat the lesser villains and ultimately the one to essentially defeat the big \"arc boss\" is Natsu which is incredibly unfortunate. Power levels are quite confusing. For example, Natsu defeats a supposedly powerful enemy like Jellal in the previous arc but then he gets defeated in the following arc by a seemingly less powerful villain. The humor is quit entertaining but that does not account for the mediocre filler episodes. Major character development is yet to be discovered, pretty much everyone stays exactly the same. The plethora of side characters are not worth mentioning because they add so little with the plot except fight the villains in the \"mini-tournaments\" and add comic relief with the exception of Wendy, Laxus, Charlie, Gildartz, and Gajeel. Fighting is quite Dragon Ball Z like, this is most evident in the Natsu and Gajeel fight. Most of the time it boils down to Deux-Ex-Machina moments like constant random power ups directly (mainly towards Natsu, Lucy, Gray, and Erza),\"Nick of the time\" character save situations and \"My magical attack/technique is stronger than your magical attack/technique\" sayings. Did I mention Hiro is obsessed with friends and friendship speeches? With the power of your friends and your \"nakama\" behind you can conquer any challenge in this universe, in other words if you see a villain who is not so pro-friendship they are for sure going to be defeated and be unsuccessful in their plans.  I know friendship is amazing but don't over-saturate it to point where it's obviously forced down our throats.\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail is a great example of an average Shounen. Perfect for people who are new to the Shounen genre but those who are are experienced will be disappointed.  \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Everything a Shounen symbolizes\\n\r\n+Entertaining and Humorous to an Extent\\n\r\n+Some Memorable Characters (Happy, Gajeel, Laxus, Ultear, Mest...)\\n\r\n+Friendly Environment and Atmosphere\\n\r\n+Fan service for both Sexes\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-No Originality \\n\r\n-Plenty Shounen Tropes and Cliches\\n\r\n-Too many Static Characters (Natsu, Gray, Erza, Gajeel, Lucy, Master, Loki... etc.)\\n\r\n-Uneven Character Spotlights (i.e. Too much Natsu, Erza, Lucy and not enough screen time for other more interesting characters)\\n\r\n-Formulaic/Predictable Story Telling \\n\r\n-No Major Character Development \\n\r\n-Dues Ex Machina Moments\\n\\n",

Every episode tries to have some emotional bullsh*t and the fights are terrible, friendship power up > all\r\nStory:\r\nOk, so this is the story of natsu ( lucy ? i dont even know who is the main ) and his friends. They are all part of a guild and go out on jobs. Natsu wants to find his lost dragon but 75 episodes into he does nothing to find him.....NOTHING!!!\r\nThe story never gets darker or something, its just natsu and pals vs other guilds.\r\nArt:\r\nIts good, the backgrounds suck tho.\r\nSound:\r\nEasily the best thing about fairy tail.\r\nCharacters:\r\nHate the maincharacters. Natsu gets zero character development and wins all battles because well, friendship power up > all, right ?!\\n\r\nThe rest of the bunch is uninteresting, lucy is there only to show us her boobs and legs, gray is the same but for girls, always stripping, and finnaly erza which is not that bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe main theme of the anime is: friendship, at first it was cool but after 10 friendship speeches... oh god.\\n\\n\r\nSoooo if you want something that doesnt focus on story or character development ( if you like bad animes lol ) and tries too hard to teach you that friendship is important, this is for you.\\n",

            "content": "This is only my third review, and im am not a very skilled english-writer, but please bear with me.\r\nFairy Tail itself is one of my favorite series. I will try not to compare the anime too much with the manga, since this a a review for the ANIME, but i must note that the fairy tail MANGA is my favorite shounen manga, and i have been following that series for years, also before the anime show started.\r\nWhy people should watch Fairy Tail? well if you like the shoune genre, it would really be a waste if you don't! Fairy Tail have all the good shounenpoints, amazing characters, amazing fights, comedy, and best of all; no long explanations during every fight and every attack (I am reffering to the big top 3 here).\\n\\n\r\nStory: The Story in fairy tail is amusing, but there indeed is not very much plot going on here. Most of the things happening seems rather random. But the story is set up on a group of people in a mage guild named Fairy Tail, where the series main topic probably is friendship between them. With at story like this, not having any special plot actually works. Instead of plot, we have fun and interesting small arcs all the time, which never makes Fairy Tail boring! And we all have to remember that Fairy Tail is still on-going, and there is lot of unanswered questions yet to figure out, so it is possible for a deeper plot to pop up in the end!\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: Here i must compare a little to the Manga (Sorry). The manga have AMAZING art, however the animation in the manga is not near as good. This is also the main reason why i won't give this anime a overall score on 10. To be honest, when i watched the first episode of Fairy Tail in 2009, i have been looking forward for it to air the whole day, and i was a little disappointed when i watched it. worse was it, that from episode 2 and on to episode 15-20, the animation keept being bad, well, the little animation there where! Fairy Tail, both in openings/endings and in the episodes themself like to use A LOT of non-moving pictures, which is a shame, because fairy tail haves potentiale to have some really kick ass scenes.\\n\r\nThe fights lack a little too compared to the manga, or just other shounen series, because of the BLOOD censur (which annoys be greatly! We can not show blood in the anime, but naked girls is no problem!)\\n\\n\r\nhowever, the anime still manages to have some good fights, where the Erza arc was animated pretty good, and so some of the other big fights.\\n\\n\r\nalso, a lot of people have been talking about Fairy Tail being a rip off or copy from One Piece. that is deffintly not true! Yes, the art is somewhat similar and yes both series are a lot about their \"nakamas\" for really, its two very different stories. Try sit down and read shojo, i can find over 10 stories with different mangakas, but with similar art and story. Fairy Tail and One Piece are NOT the same, Fairy Tail is NOT a rip off, DON'T compare them, seriously ..\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail have without doubt the most EPIC soundtracks! It makes you go \"hell yeah, go fairy tail\" everytime the main theme for their fighting scenes plays, and it makes you cry, when the sad themes are played during sad scenes. \\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail also have an amazing Voice Acting cast (In japanese) with some of the very popular seiyuu's, like Happy's voice actor Kugimiya Rie (Alphonse, Taiga, Shana, Louise, etc) and Lucy's voice actor Hirano Aya (Suzumiya Haruhi, Izumi Konata, etc) and my own favorites, Natsu and Gray's voice actors Kakihara Tetsuya (Simon, Amaimon, etc) and Nakamura Yuuichi (Tomoya, Greed, Gai, Ikuto, etc) and there are a lot more amazing voice actors, but that would be too much to list here now. Go check out for yourself!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There are a lot of characters in Fairy Tail, it should be possible to at least find a few you would like. To me, all the characters are very likeable, i specially like our Main hero Natsu, because he seems bold, but he actually isn't stupid or slow or dense like other typical shounen heros are. Also with our characters, fairy tail manage to create some interesting relationships between our characters, both deep friendship, but also romantic ones, which usally is really rare in shounen. I'm sure that there haven't been lots of girls, watching series like Bleach, One Piece or Naruto and just wishing for some romantic relationships to happen. Well i will say that Fairy Tail manages to give you - maybe not fully canon - but surely lots of romantic possible relationship.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Unless you really have a problem with half naked girls and breasts, which you really cannot escape from in Fairy tail however much i wish for it, it should not be possible for anyone to not enjoy this anime! It is just hilarious and funny but still have its good and serious moments, and even some complicated relationships between some of our characters, and Fairy Tail manage to surprise me lots of times too!\\n\\n\r\nI will reccomend this anime to all people who like shounen, or like a fun anime with lots of comedy.\\n\r\nThere might be some girls, like myself, who doesn't find the fan service rather interesting (Yes - boobs, huge boobs and LOTS of them) but i myself just learned to look over it, since most of the times, this fanservice is invovled with something funny, which really just makes you laugh of it anyway. For guys who like this kind of fan service.. so much more reason for you to watch it!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all. Wanna watch a funny, interesting and good anime? Watch Fairy Tail.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you like fairy tail, i would really reccomend reading the Manga too. But that would mostly be because of the fact that the art is awesome, and manga contains blood, which makes the fighting scenes look a little more badass, and characters like Gray, is often drawn very hot and cool in the manga, where he get less epic moments in the Anime. Other than that, the Anime and Manga is pretty much the same, i'm surprised to have watched 119 episodes of Fairy Tail, and there haven't been any massive fillers yet. i will believe there have been all in all 10 episodes out of the 119 which have contained fillers, and that was not BAD fillers, and it wasn't 10 episodes in a row, so it made a annoying filler arc. Also the Fairy Tail anime likes to animate some of the many Fairy Tail Special/Extra/Omakes chapters and put them into the series or create some amazing hilarious OVA episodes out of them.",

            "content": "Action Shounen's are a genre im very familar with having watched more than i could possibly name so naturally i was drawn to Fairy Tail which seems to be the next big \"never ending story\" which as of this review has over 90 episodes. While the premise of the series is interesting being about magic and guilds, ultimatley the series fails to really break any new grounds and throughout the course of the 80 odd episodes i've seen has really left me with a reoccuring feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e1 vu.\nStory\nAs you are probably aware, the story begins with a teenage girl named Lucy Heartfilia who hasset out to become a mage of the world famous guild Fairy Tail. During her search she inadvertently meets a boy named Natsu Dragneel a dragon slayer who has a very fiery personality as well as a huge appetite and is searching for a dragon by the name of Igneel along with his flying blue cat companion named Happy. Natsu invites Lucy to be a mage in the Fairy Tail guild and the two form a partnership along with the ice mage Gray Fullbuster and s-class mage as well as team leader of their quartet Erza Scarlet and as a team embark on various quests and adventures. \\n\\n\nThe story is seperated into many arcs which is typical of action shounen, each arc is quite short, generally 10 episodes or less (although the last two have exceeded this number) with very few filler in between. This is where the feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e1 vu kicks in for me because over the course of the series each arc seems to follow the same basic structure. You have your main antagonist along with his or hers henchman threatening to obtain or destroy something that effects the balance of peace in the world of Fairy Tail to which of course the mage's of the Fairy Tail guild in particular Natsu, Lucy, Gray and Erza are there to oppose them. You may be thinking to yourself  \"hey doesn't the majority of action Shounen boil down to good vs evil?\" but in Fairy Tail while there are some good ones, most arcs are told in the same bland, repetitive, unimaginative and predictable way. To start the main bad guy and his henchman tend to put a beatdown on the Fairy Tail members. Natsu vows to win round 2 at all cost and take down the main antagonist because he is the only one who can and wether its through sheer will power, friendship or some other power up thats what happens and the threat is stopped. Throw in one of the Fairy Tail members (usually Erza) willing to sacrafice themselves before being stopped at the very last moment by Natsu who delivers them a very clich\u00e9 speech. Then add the main antagonists of this series following the same basic pattern of going from calculative to crazed during the heat of battle to finally either remorseful for their actions in defeat or plain forgotten about the very next arc and folks you have a Fairy Tail arc. The lack of significant consequences at the conclusion for most arcs or the feeling that the story is continously building in a well structured manner, doesn't help its cause either. \\n\\n\nThe tone of the anime is very light hearted, there's no blood and while death is explored the lives of the Fairy Tail characters or bad guys rarely feel like they are in any significant danger. Even when its insinuated, you know everything is going to turn out okay. The series is also very heavy with humor and wackiness most of which fall flat as the jokes tend to come off very forced. There is also quite a bit of fan service with girls with big boobs and skimpy clothing which really isn't a positive or negative for me.\\n\\n\nCharacters\\n\\n\nNatsu is your typical dense, stubborn main shounen hero with an affinity for food and Lucy is your weak, smart, sexy female character. Each of the characters in the Fairy Tail guild tend to have common traits or unsual quirks for instance Natsu's motion sickness which leaves him incapacitated, Gray's always unconsciously stripping his clothes off, Erza being a tsundere and guild master Makarov being an old pervert ect. Throughout the course of the series we get a decent back story on the four main characters + Happy aswell as some of the supporting cast. While the series does well to show some of the hardships the chracters went through there really is very little character development outside of this and for the most part there is even a lack of explanation for what motivated the characters to join the fairy tail guild or what their goals are while there.\\n\\n\nArt and Sound\\n\\n\nWhile it doesn't stand out in any big way, the art is clean and vibrant and the character designs are very similar to Hiro Mashima's other series Rave and is typical of what you would come to expect from a shounen series in this day and age. At the beginning of the series the animation was quite poor and there was an overuse of magic circles and still frames but as the series progresses this gets toned down dramatically and there is a notable improvement in the animation. The sound is another good aspect of the show it borrows heavily from old english folk music which really works well with themes of magic and festival that inspires Fairy Tail. A warning to those reading you may want to skip over the openings and endings of Fairy Tail they usually spoil alot of whats going on in a upcoming or current arc. \\n\\n\nFinal Words\\n\\n\nFairy Tail is a series with alot of potential that a lack of creativy, originality and at times pacing stop it from being anything more than another generic action shounen anime. Its a show i could reccomend to someone who is new to the genre, enjoys generally short arcs with little filler, a younger viewer or someone who is a big fan of the whole magic and guilds theme. To those who have already 'seen it all' in this genre, particularly an anime like One Piece, there's really is no good reason for you to be watching this series unless you have time to kill.\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes there will be shows that will make you laugh and cry. Sometimes the shows will raise realistic questions, and sometimes shows will leave a bitter scar in your heart. Shounen genre is the champion of genre when it comes to long running, and it is infamous for its action, and known for exploring an interesting specific topic, whether it is ninja, samurai, pirates or shinigami. Most shounen develope from the Japanese myths and culture, while some (recently even more) decides to tell the story of distant land. Fairy Tail is one of the rare shounens that tells the story of magic, set in moreof European style with guilds and magicians and mage and magic with theme of \"friendship\" and \"victory\". \\n\\n\r\nThe most reputable part of the series is its music. Sountracks are top-notch, opening and ending songs are high quality and voice acting is decent. For most and any shounen, this trait is same. Fancy opening to uplift the mood with calmer endings, accompanied by some better soundtracks, music definitely is a strong point of the show. But how many people watches the show for music? \\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, Fairy Tail is about a magic guild called \"Fairy Tail\". The story begins when Lucy Heartfilia joins this guild and finds how welcoming, fun, anti-evil, powerful, and loving it is and together, they take on missions, and fights other evil guilds. (does it remind you of a ninja village from some show?) \\n\\n\r\nOriginality is not present in this show. Everything is recycled, reused and replaced from every other shounen presented before. Lacking originality isn't bad, infact many great series weren't as original, but what Fairy Tail lacks is a genuine delivery and attention to details. Clich\u00e9s can form a decent story if used correctly, however, eveything was thrown out in the stage, \"we must protect\" \"we always win\" \"we are friends\", lengthy dialouges of why friendship is imortant all are thrown out there, and that is what grabs the attention of sleeping audience. There is no form of suspense, everything is predictable, dialouges are from the third-grade diary, protagonists are typical and not to mention the Dragon Ball complex, you know, fight enemy then make them friends, is present in this shounen too. \\n\\n\r\nProtagonists are loud, seen as patriots (as every other typical shounen), girls are for some unknown reasons portrayed as either absurdly strong and obnoxious or extremely helpless, and villains are agian, your recylced evil guys doing things with no ulterior purpose. There wasn't any development but more like a boost change in personality. One time they are bad and next episode, poof, they are good guy. The change is like skipping steps and can't be called development, more like sudden changes to characters. One time the character is weak and the next scene they somehow are the strongest character with power with unsatisfying explanation.\\n\\n\r\n The most significant things, which applies to most audience, is the character art. Gray stripping, nicely drawn out \"cool\" guys,  and EVERY SINGLE FEMALE has a voluptuous body with exaggerated top. However, you don't see audience complaining, because, there is fan service for both ends, sadly, we are in an era where normal figures are considered ugly and to promote story, shows draw out exaggerated body parts. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, beside that, is fantastic. Details are good, backgrounds are reputable, and the concept of mage and guilds are drawn fairly well. Borders are done well, and there colours are vibrant. Animation for any shounen, as always, is good too. \\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail had a little potential. Perhaps some fixing of plot, presenting some unique character could've enhanced the enjoyment. However, the show borrows so much from other shounen that you can't remember anything significant of it, beside the music. As someone who have seen One Piece, Naruto, Dragon Ball and some other major shounen, the similarity and lack of orginality is too obvious to enjoy. There are even major characters (Gildarts), stroy arcs that were completely taken from other series and inserted in this show, with minor changes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I respect Hiro Mashima's ability to draw fast and draw some good scenes, but when it comes to plot I pity these pathetic plots and characters. From my perspective, Fairy Tail is like those action anime with super fan-service, except there is no nudity, but exaggerated males and females with the given explanation for fighting ends with \"cuz we b frndz\" \\n\\n\r\nIf you're into beautiul females, typical shounen, and are half-wake when watching shows, this is definitely your anime, If you want something serious, deep, and a thrilling shounen, you may run away before wasting any time.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Fairy Tail left a bitter scar in my heart. I have wasted one summer, looking for change, unfortunately, it was pathetic.",

            "content": "I'm going to be continually updating this review as the show continues. Currently, I've seen 20 episodes of Fairy Tail and I'm extremely pleased to say that they've upped the artwork and animation. In the first few epi's, things felt a bit below par, animation was re-used in some fight sequences, and overall gave you the feeling of a resounding \"meh.\" Over the last few episodes, Fairy Tail's animation, it's soundtrack, and it's storyline have all truly begun. Character introductions are over, and the true Fairy Tail of the manga is showing through. All I can say is watch until episode 13 (a half seriesworth) and if you're still completely unsatisfied with Fairy Tail, then drop it. But keep in mind, this is a shounen anime, and sometimes the beginning is nothing like the show, or simply lacking.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail appears to follow Lucy, a Stellar Spirit Mage, and Natsu, A fire breathing/punching/kicking/eating mage who is on a search for his old master Igneel. As the story goes on however, the focus shifts and really embodies all the characters. If you were to compare Fairy Tail's story to any other anime it would be One Piece, as the general theme of adventure, nakama, comedy and climax is there, not to mention the definite similarities between Natsu and Luffy. Overall, Fairy Tail's story is a classic shounen type, but from what they've done in the manga, and how the anime is so far sizing up, Fairy Tail is sticking to it's story, without throwing in unnecessary filler (not just episodes, but the time spent in episodes). The problem with the story section, is that it can be somewhat hard to get into off the bat, but once Fairy Tail enters it's first true story arc, I can almost guarantee if you're a fan of shounen, you'll love it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe one big complaint that comes to mind as someone who has read the manga, is the magic. They've gone with this whole \"summoning circle\" approach, and though I suppose I'm getting used to it, I still know it would be better without. Now, most pilot episodes have sketchy animation. And Fairy Tail is no exception. But what I was extremely pleased to see (while watching the series) is that the animation budget seems to have kicked it into high gear upon the first story arc, and animation quality is not top notch. Don't let the first few epi's fool you, the animation in Fairy Tail is actually pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe background music does a nice job actually, it's upbeat and helps you get a feeling for the mood in general, cause when they drop the flutes, you know something's going down. This is something more recent, but for the first time in Fairy Tail I felt a real union of plot, character and background music to truly bring together a scene. It was powerful, it was invigorating, and very encouraging. Watching the show it feels like it's on a learning curve, starting from episode 1-13. 1-3 it's getting C's in school, 4-9 it's picked up to a B-, 10-12 It's rocketed up to A-, and by 14 I'm seeing real quality work come from Fairy Tail in all aspects. Honestly, if you've dropped this series, I need to say give it another chance and continue watching.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail's Character scene is diffiult to sum up. I'll start off by saying, they don't do a great job of introducing them. They just bring most of them in, and expect you to like them. And it doesn't really work.  Everyone just comes off as being uninteresting or stale at first. But as the show goes on, the characters were developed, and you can start to enjoy them. (This happens around ep. 11-14). After that, you can begin to really appreciate Fairy Tail as the manga has been built up to be. It's running on 160+ chapters, the story's got no problem going for it, you might just have to trust me that the characters start out shallow, but build into being lovable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nHere's where Fairy Tail gets it's points. Once the cast is introduced you get into the story and it's a captivating tail (see what I did there? ;D). I find myself laughing at Happy's antics, Lucy's misfortunes and Natsu and Gray's relationship/overall attitude. The fight scenes are interesting and eye catching, and the story is fun to follow. Fortunately 161 chapters in, and I've yet to see Fairy Tail's story turn for the worse, like many shounen manga/anime fall victim to. So here's looking forward to an anime that can go strong for years to come.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI give Fairy Tail a 9. The story is solid, and it's very enjoyable, and that's really all you can ask. If you want to complain about art, sound, and character, all I have to say is keep watching. My old review said \"you'll just have to trust me that things will get better\" and I'm glad to see that that premonition came to pass. In my opinion, an anime is all about how much you enjoy it, and Fairy Tail is one to enjoy.",

            "content": "I had heard of a legendary manga called Fairy Tail, and when an anime version of it was announced, I was really happy.  I wanted to watch a mainstream shounen (as in.. Bleach, Naruto, One Piece) from the very beginning, since those three aforementioned series have way too many episode for me to catch up on, anyway.\r\nI was sorely disappointed.\r\n==[Pros]==\r\n- Great idea.  The setting is very imaginative... but that's to be expected when you're dealing with a series like this.\r\n- Music.  The ED is very catchy, and the OP isn't bad.\r\n==[Cons]==\r\n- Characters.  They are static.  Very static.  To thepoint where I wouldn't be surprised if they could make an appearance in Zetsubou Sensei's class of stereotyped characters.  Gray is just \"rival of main character with running gag.\"  That's all we know about him after five episodes.\\n\\n\r\n- The pacing.  Introductory episodes are usually used to flesh out characters.  The four introductory episodes here are totally pointless.  The characters are just the same people we see in episode one.  I found myself asking \"why?\" to every episode.  There's no reason why these episodes should even exist.\\n\\n\r\n- The animation.  Look at the ground beneath Natsu's feet in the opening sequence.  Bad art and animation is sprinkled everywhere.\\n\\n\\n\r\n==[Conclusion]==\\n\r\nGood concept, but the static characters, mediocre animation, and nearly episodic way to storytelling make for a slow (five epiosdes) and useless introduction that makes me not want to watch any more.",

            "content": "It just sucks the way it ended\u2026\r\nNot that it ended badly, it just sucks that it ended at all. \r\nFairy Tail is, for lack of a better term, your generic shounen. You have a group of teenage wizards running around fighting bad guys and all the while they get stronger as Natsu Dragneel looks for his father\u2026 who is a dragon. Shounen clich\u00e9s come with the territory, and Fairy Tail is no exception. Think about it. If you make a shounen, no matter how you make it, it is going to have some generic components. What makes Fairy Tail so unique is that it isgood in spite of all the clich\u00e9s the plot may have. \\n\\n\r\nYou have to remember something that so many people easily forget. Not every part of a generic shounen is bad, and Fairy Tail actually does a really good job capitalizing on the things we love in a shounen. It has great humor, consistent arcs, short recaps, nice fight scenes, and most importantly nice character development. \\n\\n\r\nThe members of the Fairy Tail guild are an interesting bunch to say the least. Since they can all use magic their fighting styles are extremely diverse. After the first season you will feel like you know the members of the guild personally. There are dozens you are introduced to and you will most likely remember their names because the show does that good of a job at giving the characters a long lasting impression. When something happens to one of the members of the guild it will probably make you sad, maybe even bring on some tears. You won\u2019t even realize you have an emotional attachment to these characters until something happens. It is almost as if you are blind-sided a bit by the connection you have with the Fairy Tail guild members, and you will most definitely have a connection with the members as you will most likely see yourself in one of them. I guess it doesn\u2019t hurt that this anime had an all-star voice cast to help with making you like the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s right; you\u2019ll definitely recognize at least a few of the voices in this anime. The first one that I noticed was the voice of Toradora\u2019s Aisaka Taiga, but the show itself has many more notable voices than that including Alphonse Elric, Hanekawa Tsubasa, Miki Sayaka, and Amane Misa. A voice cast like Fairy Tail\u2019s does not come around often and is something that must be acknowledged when going into this anime. Not only does the show have an all-star voice cast but the score for the show is also pretty over the top. Normally it would be hard for a show to get the soundtrack just right but Fairy Tail managed to do it extremely well. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation should really go without saying. It is extremely well done, and fluid allowing for really awesome fights to be had. The style of the art is a little strange though, and not unlike One Piece it may put some people off at first, but after a few episodes you will find yourself really loving the art, just as you will find yourself loving the anime as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nI myself really love Fairy Tail. I love the jokes that I used to see, the characters that I got so attached to, the fight scenes, the soundtrack, the art, and you know what? I even love all the generic shounen aspects that came with it. If I had to describe the show in exactly five words I\u2019d tell you \u201cFairy Tail is really fun.\u201d Because it is, it is just plain fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m sad that it had to end. \\n\r\nI didn\u2019t want it to have to end.\\n\\n\r\n---BREAKDOWN\u2014\\n\r\nStory \u2013 5\\n\r\nArt \u2013 7\\n\r\nSound \u2013 10\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nOverall - 8",

During her travels she meets Natsu, a fellow wizard, and his mascot pet Happy. Together they travel the world and get into lots of fights, presumably, in her quest to join Fairy Tail. This is, after all, a shonen series, so that's to be expected.\r\nThe characters are standard fair for the genre: plucky, but slightly air-headed, girl, awesome fighter guy who's also an idiot, and a cute mascot pet that explains everything to the air-headed girl. Really nothing here to make them stand outfrom any of the other series from this genre.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the CG from Bantorra, this is probably the cheapest and blandest animation I've seen in the Fall '09. It's flat, has a low framerate, and minimal movements. Background characters are embarrassingly undetailed. Spell effects are mainly just some CG plastered on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't really help that everything Fairy Tail does has been done before and better by a lot of other shows like One Piece or Rave Master. \\n\\n\r\n The only real saving grace of the first episode is that it has a smattering of genuinely funny moments and some nice looking backgrounds in a few place.\\n\\n\r\n'Bland' is the word for this series. Art is bland, animation is bland, story is bland, characters are bland. Inoffensive, but tasteless.\\n\\n\r\nI guess if you really, really like these sorts of shows [shounen] then you might enjoy Fairy Tail, otherwise you can probably avoid it and not feel as though you're missing out on anything.",

            "content": "This is my first review!\r\nI\u2019ve heard of an anime called Fairy Tail becoming part of the legendary animes out there. I've watched it, and to my surprise it\u2019s not good as I expected it to be.\r\nArt:7\r\nWell to be honest, I really don\u2019t pay attention to the art when it comes to anime. I think anything goes well. However, compared to other animes out there, it has a good artistic look.  Very cartoony and joyful feeling.\r\nMusic:7\r\nIt actually has very good music. The soundtrack is epic, sounds like medieval time music, and its good. It also has a lot of classical music, like Can-Can, Pomp andCircumstance,  A on a G string, and a lot more.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:4\\n\r\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of Shounen animes, and well this is your typical characters you find in an anime. Natsu is your average energetic guy who loves eating, and always pumped up when going into battle.  Similar to Naruto and Luffy. Lucy is also your average wacky girl who is very clumsy and not very powerful.  Yet she has a very nice body, like the rest of the girls in Fairy Tail. Gray and Natsu are always competing about power and constantly fighting  with each other.  Finally, Erza is like the babysitter in the group; she is serious, strong, and intelligent.  In other words, the characters are not really that unique. \\n\\n\r\nStory:5\\n\r\nThis anime is about this teenage girl names Lucy Heartfilia whose goal is to become a great mage. On her way, she meets this boy about her age named Natsu Dragneel , and Natsu invites her to be a member of Fairy Tail. In there, they form a group along with Gray, Natsu\u2019s friend/enemy, Happy, Natsu\u2019s pet, and Erza. All 5 do jobs in Fairy Tail in order to earn money.  Its not a very unique or exciting storyline. When fighting, Natsu \u2018natually\u2019 gets to fight with the final boss, and wins epictly, like in a typical Shounen anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:6\\n\r\nI have to be honest, but the anime does have a lot of humorous scenes. The gang is always fooling around, Lucy always wants to get guys attention but fails,  Natsu and Gray are always fighting, Happy always thinks about fish and says the most hilarious stuff, and much other things.  Inside the guild is a joyous feeling. However, this is not the reason I don\u2019t like it. When it comes to fighting, the battles are always predictable.  Natsu always fights the boss, and wins naturally. Also the good guys always win no matter what.  If everyone is in peril, they somehow win by an ultimate attack, or something miraculously happens.  In other words, its dull. The battles are not epic or fun to watch.  Additionally, not a lot of deaths occur. Everyone always survives to be good and dandy.  Not much blood is spilled either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 5. It isn\u2019t exciting and so typical.  The storyline is typical, the characters are common, fights are dull and predictable. A lot of people seem to like it because of the humor and cause it has a joyous environment.  I like humor, but not all the time.\\n",

I now have to take monthly breaks in between of individual episodes so that I can convince myself that the next episode wont be as bad as the last.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nIf this section of the review is a mess it is because there is no way in words to describe how horrifically bad fairy tails story is and I have therefore just ranted for a while about how bad it is as well as I could.\r\nImagine if nobodyever died even the bad guys. Does that sound like an interesting story with high stakes? This is what Fairy tail is. Not only that but every villain seems to have a change of heart and become good or just comes back to be defeated again. Death is something acknowledged as happening in the past yet literally nobody seems capable of being killed from blows that should destroy entire cities.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no plot development, a horrific seven year skip, an overarching story that disappoints at every turn, so much bad filler, people recover strength from fucking friendship in every fight etc.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has got to the point where each horrifically short story arc is incredibly easy to predict. The story never changes it is just on a constant loop in which the heros lose then get motivated and come back to win.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art has its ups and downs (more downs) but is what you would expect from an anime of this size. I have never been disappointed with the art but it has never excited me either.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is made watchable only by its well voiced characters, good sound effects and great music. I still listen to some of this anime's music despite the horrific memories it gives me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe pros of the characters are that they are well designed and all have their own interesting distinct powers. If this anime had been good then I would have been very pleased with the cool way magic is portrayed in such variety.\\n\\n\r\nThe cons of the characters is that they NEVER FUCKING DIE. Literally every character is invincible there are no stakes. They also reintroduce characters that should be long dead and make previous story arcs even more pointless.   More characters are added at such a rate and bad guys convert to good so fast that there are now hundreds of main characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm being generous here when I say this",

            "content": "From what I understand this anime is loved by a lot of people (As it frequently shows up on recommendations and top ten lists) but I'll proudly say that I just don't get it. With that said, I understand the story and everything about the anime, but I personally don't see what people are calling so great.\r\nAs a professional critic, this is where I'd normally explain the show and characters but if you're reading this chances are you know those things already. So going right into, I'll just say that (once again, in my opinion) nothing really works with this anime. The characters aren't interestingor memorable at all (the protagonists can even be quite annoying), and the story is pretty generic. Lucy wants to Be the Very Best, That No One Ever Was(Or be Hokage, whichever reference you prefer) but I found myself not very much caring. She reminds me a lot of Lina Inverse (from Slayers for those of you new-school otaku), she's a young, strong minded female wizard/sorcerer who goes on a journey with newly-encountered friends. Unlike Lina, though, she's less outgoing and pretty much an amalgam of 65% of all other female anime characters. Mild temper? check! Generic backstory that includes a parent dying? check! I also recall that she seems to have an almost identical personality to Natsumi from Sgt. Frog, i.e. the most normal person in their crazy surroundings, tendency to yell a lot and get embarrassed easily, annoyed ny the shenanigans of her fellow protagonists...this all comes full circle when I remembered the two had the same English voice actor.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, Lucy's my favorite character, only because the rest are far worse. There's the hilariously incompetent pink-haired sidekick and the token animal/cute thing every show like this needs. So with characters who are nothing but archetypes and cliches slapped together in different combinations, and shallowly generic stories, it adds up to long-winded episodes stuffed to the brim with bright and bouncy overreactions and loudness, and mediocre action scenes, which I can't really enjoy because I don't care what happens to the characters or how the story ends.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, I'll compare Fairy Tail to two other Shonen-based anime. Dragon Ball Z and Yu Yu Hakusho (which happen to be my two favorite anime). Where YYH spent SEVEN EPISODES doing nothing but developing characters and making you fall in love with the protagonists before getting to the action, Fairy Tail just starts off with annoying characters meeting and a big fight right afterward. Now, I'm not saying every anime should be slow paced at the beginning, but they should at least give us something to latch onto before throwing us in the middle of fast-paced action (which, in this show's case, isn't very fast-paced or exciting at all). Which leads us to DBZ. It had characters and action balanced to a tee. When some new evil thing threatened to destroy the world, we couldn't wait to see our heroes try and stop them (Even if it took like 12 episodes a time) and when someone died, we were all hit in our soft spot (regardless of how many dozens of times they've died before). We just couldn't wait to see the said villains face caved in with an energy-blast. Meanwhile, in Fairy Tail, I could care less who dies, even less what ends up happening, and I\"m just thrown off by the unbalance of the story/action ratio. Unlike the two anime I just mentioned, Fairy Tail provides too many scenes of long-winded action and excitement to get into the story and characters, and is bogged down too much by needless exposition, annoying character-interactions and overall cliches to really care about the action either. If you like the series, good for you, everyone has their own opinion. However, if you're wondering why some people don't (And I realize I'm in a minority here) I hope I gave insight",

            "content": "When I first picked up Fairy Tail, I had heard much hype from friends -- that it would pose a challenge to the big four kings of shonen anime, e.g. Naruto/Bleach/One Piece/Fullmetal Alchemist. After watching the first few episodes, I could not decide whether I hated it or loved it. I gave it a 6 for many reasons, but I personally have started to follow it and hope it develops.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story is one of interesting concept, not over-done in anime right now: a world of magicians and wizards, where everyone has the ability to do some form of magic. At the start, I wasconfused whether Fairy Tail was a shonen or a shojo.  We start off with an adorable, innocent looking girl aspiring to become a great wizard. Each wizard belongs to a guild, sort of an organization that gathers people together as allies (think Squad in Bleach, Hidden Village in Naruto, or crew in One Piece, etc.). \\n\r\nThe story progresses as you are set up with your protagonists being very under developed but having an interesting(at first) plot. Lucy, the main character, is the aspiring girl who was thrust into the guild Fairy Tail. She is quickly taken under Natsu's wing, one of the strongest wizards in Fairy Tail. Of course, given this, Natsu is incredibly powerful and can wipe the floor with any normal opponent, reminiscent of Bleach's Ichigo and his godlike powers. Other equally-god-like characters are introduced to create what attempt to be fair battle sequences, but fail as it is obvious through some \"I-WIN\" method that Natsu and Lucy are always going to win. The one redeeming factor of the story is the little change found in Lucy as well as the occasional good moral or funny scene.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe art almost made my eyes bleed. It was so blatantly attempting to fanservice people it almost made me cringe. The art would go from intense battle sequences, with at least some effort put it, to some low quality form of joke with little to no imagination. The art seemed mediocre at best, being bested by many 90s anime(see: Rurouni Kenshin / DBZ). While older anime may not have been as \"clean\" as a new one like Fairy Tail, the art is clearly sloppy and the episodes made to be a cash cow.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6.5\\n\\n\r\nSound is a decent factor in this. None of the tracks are memorable (see: Lena Park's rendition of \"You Raise Me Up,\" found in Romeo X Juliet). It can be fitting at times, and the OP and ED are not too bad. It looks as though the creators of Fairy Tail actually tried to find some appropriate music and settings, though it cannot save the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nStatic. Static static static bland boring static. You are introduced to the main few characters within the first two or three episodes, and then from there, besides Lucy, there is no development. Each of the characters has some rivalry or funny quirk that attempts to make them seem less Mary Sue, but basically all of the characters short of Lucy are godly powerful and make others worship them. The one aforementioned, Natsu, was trained by a dragon and can utilize fire to deadly possibilities. The line is even said that he could reduce an entire city to rubble...which implies how incredibly unbalanced it seems. Likewise, the characters seem to jump in power from average to within seconds godlike, having a decent battle sequence followed by an overly-powered God-like maneuver performed by a protagonist. The only worthwhile watch here is that of Lucy, who seems to progress and gain some depth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6.5\\n\\n\r\nFor the first two episodes, I was IM'ing a friend saying \"This can't be a legit anime. It's like Fruits Basket and One Piece had a baby which was then hit over the head with a waffle iron.\" But the anime slowly grew on me, regardless of the low quality of animation, lack of character development, or general idea of plot. Being such a shonen sucker, I keep watching Fairy Tail hoping it can at least turn out to be something similar to One Piece, Bleach, or Naruto -- something at least watchable. For the new viewer of anime, it is a good easer into the more intense stuff, but overall I would give this anime a 6.5 / 10, solely for its lack of effort, when it was hyped to be a very good anime and manga.",

            "content": "Story: 5 (Mediocre)\r\nFairy Tail is a shounen anime that revolves around a Mage Guild called 'Fairy Tail'. Each arc in the anime revolves around 4 main characters; Natsu, Lucy, Erza and Gray.\r\nThe first few arcs in the show have varying plots that slowly unravel these characters' pasts. Later arcs have plots related more-so to the guild's history, but the show never fails to ruin a good plot with the addition of random bad guys used purely for battle-scenes, so characters can power up with the power of friendship. yay. \r\nAnother downfall to the story of Fairy Tail is that is had no direction it ismoving in. Okay, so Natsu has his ultimate goal to find his trainer and guardian Igneel -  the dragon that raised him and taught him Dragon Slayer magic - but the anime is over 150 episodes long and we haven't seen even the slightest trace of a dragon. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 (Fair)\\n\r\nThe art and animation are also very average, but they do increase in quality as the show progresses. The show is a very colourful and vibrant one, with settings that are always very visually appealing, and characters that have nice attire and yes, the good ol' anime hairstyles we've all come to kow and love.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I gave the Art category a 6 is because the animation of characters is hardly ever fluid, even in fight scenes, the frame rate skips, the punches aren't actually punching, they are just posing in front of diagonal lines... It's just, for an anime that has so much fighting, I expect good quality animation, and it's simply not there (don't get me wrong, there are some good fights, but they are scarce).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 (Great)\\n\r\nFinally, something Fairy Tail has that I find are lacking in other shounens; a good soundtrack!\\n\\n\r\nI believe there are three soundtracks released to date and they are what make the many prevalent fight scenes so damn epic. I would not have watched Fairy Tail past the first few arcs if there wasn't some awesome electric guitar riff going on while Natsu was punching his way to victory. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5 (Mediocre)\\n\r\nThe story and the characters are a crucial part of a shounen, and should come second to nothing. The main characters in Fairy Tale are given a whole lot of backstory, terrible pasts, shock twists etc etc.\\n\r\nMost character's pasts are cliche and overly dramatic, and these only apply to our main 4 protagonists, and a few side characters (The Elfman, Lisanna, Mirajane trio for example).\\n\\n\r\nAnother downfall for characters is that they remain very static throughout the show, and hardly ever budge from their niche. What I mean by this is that every character's past defines who they are in the show, and who they pretty much always will be. There are no moments in the show that change the characters behaviour hardly at all, and I find that very unfortunate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 (Good)\\n\r\nObviously there was something that made me gat over 100 episodes into this show. That my friends, was purely because I enjoyed myself.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in the show is a major highlight, with crazy characters, funny one-liners and silly situations all mixed into one another to make us laugh and smile. And that's what Fairy Tail is; it's fun! Sure it is serious when it needs to be, but you can always count on someone to brighten up the mood almost instantly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 (Fair)\\n\r\nOkay, so there's the final verdict; a solid 6. Fairy Tail is a shounen anime that shines in its comedy, its soundtrack and a few decent fights along the way, but it lacks in unique and original story and plot, character development, and animation at times. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are just starting off on anime, its a great gateway anime, but if you're a seasoned anime fan, there are better shounens out there, and there are better comedic shows out there, so its not really worth the length the show goes for (with no end in sight as of yet).",

            "content": "Well, first of all, I would like to start by saying that this is my very first review so forgive me if I fail to do a proper one. I'll try my best though.\r\nAnyway, let me say that I started watching Fairy Tail by mere curiosity. I had never heard of if at the time, but the Freeze fansubs, group that was doing Dragon Ball Kai (as I big fan of the DB series of course I watched it)  had it among its projects and it caught my eye. There were only about 30 episodes or so released and I thought that if thegroup thought of if to be a good series to work on, that I should give it a try. At first I was skeptical because I never really liked fantasy animes that had magic involved, and from the little research I made around the web, Fairy Tail was just a clone of One Piece (a series that I have yet to watch - too much to catch up with). Yet, after a handful of episodes it had me grabbed. It was a very nice surprise. I had finally found a typical shounen series that really satisfied me. Obviously, after catching up with the anime I started on the manga and kept following both ever since.  But long story aside, let's go to the actual review of the anime, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\\n\r\nI won't lie, there is nothing of really new and innovating about Fairy Tail story wise. It's your typical shounen anime and all the clich\u00e8s that the genre entails. It portraits the adventures of your typical carefree  shounen hero and his group of friends. The main theme of Fairy Tail is of course, friendship, and therefore good always triumph over evil, not because the good guys are stronger, but because the good guys have friends who support them and that protect each other. As I said, nothing new here. If there is something that may, or may not be kind of new, is that we are not exactly sure who the main character is. At first glance you say, Natsu. He's the strong, cheerful guy with cool powers - the obvious choice. But soon you notice that it's the heroine, Lucy, who's in charge of introducing the story to us, and she's often the center of the story. I find that very refreshing. \\n\r\nThe story arcs follow the manga faithfully, and throughout them we are presented with a bit of everything: drama, humor, bits of romance  and of course lots of fighting and cool powers, everything in the right doses and well timed. The often dreaded fillers are rare, and when present don't really disappoint, keeping the same spirit of the series and not interfering with the flow of the main story. \\n\r\nOne could say that the story is one of the weakest points of Fairy Tail. Yet it is far from being bad. It's the opposite actually. It's simple, straightforward but interesting enough to keep you hooked and far from being bored. You don't need to pay extra attention to be able to follow the plot. Most events are predictable in all good shounen style, but at the same time you won't be able to figure out the story's biggest mysteries until the due time comes.\\n\\n\r\nSo while it is true that there is nothing of really outstanding about the story of Fairy Tail, there is nothing of wrong about it either.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail's art is in my opinion the weakest point of the show. There is nothing   about it that stands out, neither good or bad. Everything is as expected in a long ongoing series such as this. The animation can vary from fairy decent to something more blend and flat at times. But at least in key scenes of the story the anime staff seems to put extra effort in the art and its animation.  \\n\r\nAll in all, even if the art in Fairy Tail is not anything worth of jaw-dropping awe, it is good enough not to make you cringe. It's on the same quality level of any other long series anime show currently airing. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nI'm giving 9/10 mostly because of the OST (background music). I may not understand much about music, if it's well composed or not, if it's rich or not, but I just know I like what I hear. The music always suits very well the moment which is playing, being varied enough to suit whatever moment is playing. The music has a particular significance during emotional scenes. It helps conveying the feelings of the characters. \\n\r\nThe sound effects are neither bad or good. Most of the times you don't really notice them. But that's a good thing. It means they are well timed and serve their purpose. But there is one sound in particular that I particularly like. I call it the \"ecchi\" sound. It that little \"ahhhh\" you hear in every scene where there is any sexual reference. It's hilarious really. It's not unique to Fairy Tail, but it's in this anime that I've seen it being used better. \\n\r\nThe voice actors also seem to know what they are doing pretty well. All characters sound  good and befitting of their personalities. i would say the cast was perfectly chosen and they make such a good job that you tend to forget that what you are seeing and watching are animated characters.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are nice too. I personally prefer the ending songs mostly because they are usually more on the slow side. But the openings songs always have that hype that really say \"look, this anime is cool and very fun to watch\" .\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\\n\r\nHere is one of the points that I think Fairy Tail has of best. There is good number of characters, suitable for all kinds of tastes, all of them interesting and likable, both main characters and supporting characters. Every single character is unique in their own way. It's normal to have one character or two that you like best, but in Fairy Tail you will find yourself having trouble electing one. They are all so cool and/or funny. Throughout the series most of them have a good share of development an focus. Even minor characters are important. Even if they don't do much by themselves, they are an important part of the whole.   \\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, it's not easy to define who the protagonist of the show is. I guess we can talk about a main group instead of a particular character. Which, in my modest opinion, is a good thing. I get tired of anime of this same genre that talk about how important is to work as a team but that in the end everything is put in the hands of one main character while the others stay in the sidelines, being useless or getting in the way.\\n\r\nThere is another thing that I really like about Fairy Tail characters - the female characters are not there just for fan service. Most of them are strong and can put the male characters to shame. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nI'm giving such a high note to 'Enjoyment\" because in all sincerity, Fairy Tail is, above all, fun to watch. There have been several occasions where I was brought to tears, both from laughing or from getting emotional. And Fairy Tail does a good job at balancing all those good and happy emotions with the sad and bittersweet ones. It's curious how you will find yourself laughing even when the characters are at a particularly difficult situation. It wouldn't go as far as calling it comic relief though. Comic relief usually is only present in between \"heavier\" scenes or when a particular character is present. But in Fairy Tail it looks like every moment is a moment of comic relief. \\n\r\nIt's not just the comedy that is enjoyable though. As any good shounen, Fairy Tail provides laughs and tears. And although most of the fights are resolved quickly [that's right, in FT fights aren't dragged on forever] you will feel \"pumped up\" even after they are finished. \\n\r\nAll in all, Fairy Tail has a happy vibe about it that will put a smile on your face every time you watch it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9 \\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail is not the perfect anime masterpiece, not at all. It has its flaws and its qualities like any other anime.  But if you let yourself go with the flow you will find yourself really enjoying it, independently if this is your kind of show or not. I highly recommend you try it. I'm convinced you will not be disappointed.",

            "content": "Every once in a while you make a damning mistake. A mistake so profound you feel nothing but deep regret for yourself. After reading perhaps a thousand reviews on MAL, I knew I had to avoid this sizzling pile of mess like the plague, however I decided to see what made this nausea inducing anime so popular and I learnt what I already knew.\r\nPopularity doesn't make something good.\r\nObvious isn't it? But curiosity got the better of me and I decided to see it. What followed was torture so gruesome I bet even a guy from the middle ages couldn't fathom such excruciating stuff. Maybe Iwas paying for the sins I paid. Heck even all the sins committed by my ancestors wouldn't compare anything to what I went through. If there is one thing I absolutely  hate, its boredom. Fairy tail didn't bore me. It left me a gibberish wreck. There is a certain limit to how much you can recycle stuff. If we had been recycling like this in real life the Earth would be restored to its real glory. But can someone restore the time I wasted watching this harrowing anime on Animax?\\n\\n\r\nNo\\n\\n\r\nTime is precious. There are million things you can do in your life. Don't waste it on watching fairy tail. Let me tell you why you shouldn't even touch this anime with a 10 feet long stick\\n\\n\r\n1) No plot. Every anime cannot be Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, however that doesn't mean it has to be totally brain dead with nothing resembling a story. If someone ever tells you that Fairy Tail has a good story, pull out a bazooka and shoot him dead on the spot. He was sent by hell itself to mislead you. \\n\\n\r\n2) Fan service. I watch anime to listen to a good story. See characters which amaze me. Listen to music which gets me peppy. Not large chested females who somehow live with body proportions only a magazine publisher could digest. I am amazed how shameless this anime gets every time I see it.\\n\\n\r\n3) Characters - We had Dragon ball Z before. It had glorious men who fought for the Earth for peace. They were men you wanted to be. Full of courage bravado and daring. What do we have here? An annoying hero who tries to act too cool despite himself. A female lead who apparently puts silicon in her chest every episode. A red haired female called Erza who doesn't have something even resembling a personality. And a guy called Gray who you would probably discard without even looking at him. Just his sound annoys me.\\n\\n\r\n4) Friendship- Its 4v4 between the good guys and the bad guys. Only one good guy remains standing. Now its 1v4. Our hero is outmatched.Can anything save him? Lets see. A boost up in energy perhaps? Some rage induced power? Clever tactics? No mon ami, you are mistaken. The power of friendship will descent from heaven, bringing *sparkly* light and help our hero do things he couldn't do  if you had given him a cocktail of redbull, Chilean coffee, strawberry milkshake and cocaine. This anime is bullshit that's my point.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you want to feel a universal shattering kick on your nuts or brain hemorrhage  watch some fairy tail.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNo seriously don't.",

            "content": "Fairy Tail was the first anime I had ever seen and when I look back to it, I have to say it was a great gateway to the world of anime. But that is about it. The main building blocks of any anime, plot & character could have been executed a lot \u2013 when I say a lot I really mean a lot, better. \r\nThe plot is quickly summarised as generic. The main team of characters, Natsu, Lucy, Gray and Erza come across some evil activity that has to be stopped. They are later joined by Gajeel and Wendy. When they find out who isbehind this evil activity they have to stop them, by beating them. The first round they get beaten, but then the group will summon the bonds of nakama\u2019s or the willpower of Natsu will be found and he beats the people who do this certain evil activity. End of story, repeat.\\n\r\nI fear that I have summed up and summarised every arc, including the fillers. The repetitious plot is also accompanied by jokes that get old very fast, like Natsu\u2019s and any other Dragon slayers vehicle sickness. \\n\\n\r\nOutside that the characters are flat, to the extremes. They are clich\u00e9 stereotypes. It is defanatly not a good sign if you can summarize the characters in one word. You have the rival Gray, the over manly man Elfman, the pervert Makarov, the fangirl Juvia, the OP main character Natsu, the Damsel-in-distress Lucy, just to name a few. It also has inconsistencies, where Natsu at first is shown to the viewer as an user of an extremely rare kind of magic. Later you find out that there are three generations of Dragon slayers. So it is not that special after all. \\n\r\nThe thing I dislike most about this show is that the story revolves around Lucy, but she rarely gets any screen time compared to Natsu. I sometimes wonder; \u201cWhy do these things always happen to Lucy?\u2019 to then be reminded again, \u2018Oh yeah!, she is the main character\u2019. This is easily forgotten because of the immense emphasis put on Natsu.\\n\\n\r\nThe art however is not bad at all. The animations of magic are well executed and the characters look appealing to the eye. The art is solid, just like the sound. The voice acing was alright and Fairy Tail did have quite a few good OST\u2019s.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say that Fairy Tail is a great gateway to the wonderful world of anime, but other than that, it is not worthy of being watched. If you had quite the history of anime that you have watched, I would suggest that you skip this show. The art and sound are the only real upsides of this anime.\\n",

            "content": "After watching 175 episodes (minus the potentially suicidal filler arcs) of Fairy Tail, I have come to the conclusion that a total of 3,500 minutes ( roughly translated to 58 HOURS and 20 MINUTES) has been completely and utterly wasted on this horrible excuse of an anime. And in case you're wondering, I am going easy on this since it's a shonen, hell those 3 points are me being MERCIFUL.\r\n This will be a full in-depth analysis to try to understand what exactly makes this show so bad. I will try not to mention \"nakama power boosts\" and \"unkillable characters\" as most people think that'swhats wrong with the show. However, there are many more glaring problems that must be recognized before stuff like \"nakama power boosts\". Strap on your googles, Pick up  your shovels and join me as we shovel to the heart (rectum) of Fairy Tail to decide which shit is better than that shit. Understand? No? Welcome to Fairy Tail. Let's Begin.\\n\\n\r\nTHE GOOD\\n\r\nThe number of things that are good in Fairy Tail are limited but I will mention the few that are so I don't sound biased.\\n\r\nThe first thing that comes to mind is it's great soundtrack. Fairy Tail's soundtrack is both incredibly beautiful and emotional at times, dramatic and even badass at times. I really love it's Celtic styled theme song as it suits the show perfectly. All of it's openings are all great. A few of the abilities in the show like Erza's Requip are unique and fun to watch. Hmmm...that's kind of all really, I mean...Happy's funny, I guess?\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD\\n\r\n1. LACK OF ORIGINALITY\\n\r\nA show needs to offer something that's unique and creative. Something they won't find in any other show. In One Piece there's a daring pirate world, In Bleach there's a haunting afterlife world and In Naruto there's a ninja world. Each of these are different in their own right and that's what makes them so successful. Now, take a look at Fairy Tail. Nothing stands out in fact everything just feels like a rehash of stuff that's already been done in OP, Bleach and Naruto. In fact, look at all the similarities between One Piece and Fairy Tail. The show blatantly copies it's art style and themes. Just take a look at how much Natsu is similar to Luffy.\\n\\n\r\n It's world feels empty and soulless outside of it's guild, which shows how poor it's landscape and world building are. If there was one thing that the show attempts to do differently, it's romance. By romance, I mean \"shipping\". Don't know what that means? It translates to \"a never ending romance that never truly begins but is based purely on MAYBE\". Unfortunately, this has also been done time and time again. It's a neat trick that the writer came up with to keep you from escaping this nightmare. TIP TRICK: Listen up, guys. My gone off broccoli is more likely to get with Lucy than that stupid ass pink haired retard. If they ever do get together, I can guarantee it will be only at the VERY END to keep all you fan girls watching.\\n\\n\r\n2.LACK OF OVERALL OBJECTIVE/GOAL\\n\r\nI simply cannot fathom how the show could f*ck THIS up. But surprise, surprise, they did it again. Establishing an overall goal is critical for any anime ESPECIALLY a shonen anime due to their overall length. This is done to prevent people from becoming bored and wondering \"what the f*ck is going on?\" You'd think that the goal would be to find Natsu's dad, which although it's a cliche in itself at least its a clear goal, but nope. Natsu only mentions his \"all important lost father who he hasn't seen in like 10 YEARS\" when he feels like it which is every 50 episodes or when he's not eating something. Because of this each arc feels extremely sloppy and random, and we begin to ask ourselves,\"what the f*ck is going on?\". Oh, almost forgot if you thought the story is awful wait till you watch the filler arcs which will break even the strongest will power to their submission. PRO TIP: NEVER EVER even look in the direction of a filler arc. Luffy wants to be the Pirate King= STRAIGHT FORWARD GOAL, Naruto wants to be the greatest Hokage= STRAIGHT FORWARD GOAL.\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, it's like taking away the handle bars on a bike. It doesn't have a clear path but it's definitely going somewhere alright. Probably to the soul crushing and tortuous guild know as Fairy Tail.\\n\\n\r\n3. UNRELATABLE/AWFUL CHARACTERS\\n\r\nI suppose you expect me to now go on a rant on how Natsu's character has as much believability as a magical unicorn. I suprisingly don't have many issues with his character. Maybe it's because I had anticipated this type of character or maybe it's because it's been so overdone, Goku/Luffy, that it doesn't bother me anymore. Natsu is a representation of a symbol more than a character. That however, does not excuse the other main characters in the show. Each and every single character is incredibly beautiful and powerful. I think the writer's intention was for Lucy to feel relatable to the viewer? I find this difficult when her first noble act is seduction in order to get a cheaper price. She then eventually becomes OP as f*ck just like everyone else. The only weak character left is Happy. This would be fine if he wasn't a BLUE CAT. Are the writers implying that we mere humans are as useless as blue cats? No, scratch that, we wouldn't survive a blast radius of 200 metres. Only a f*ckin' blue cat could achieve that.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of 'character development' there appears to be some at the start of the series. It starts off with Gray, whose past turns out to be exceptionally boring. Bare in mind this is within the first 20 episodes of the show. Although, development is seen in the arc after it the development just up and vanishes. Character's simply revert to the way they used to be. Character development means it alters there decisions in the FUTURE. They will do things they would never do before. It feels like the writer wants to get their 'development' out of the way. Some characters are given ACTUAL development but they're usually supporting characters like Laxus and Cana. After their time to shine, they simply fade into the background and return to their roles as insanely beautiful and powerful non important characters. Others characters will feel bland and unmemorable. There's also Erza who can win any fight. WHY? Because shes's ERZ-f*ck off.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Fairy Tail simply look cool but lack in any depth. They all come as stereotypical and unmemorable. When you turn all your characters into unstoppable gods, they will end up feeling unrelatable to the viewer therefore we will not give two sh*ts about them.\\n\\n\r\n4.ANIMATION/FIGHT SCENES\\n\r\nAside from it's not particularly original art, the main problem with it's animation is it's god awful fight scenes. It's fights are only bad because of two massive reasons. \\n\r\n 1. NO BLOOD. I'm not asking for gore fests like Hellsing just A LITTLE MOLECULE OF BLOOD so  I can feel like the character is in danger. Like it's just blood? BLOOD? It's a perfectly normal aspect of life and by not introducing it in the show it becomes a 6 year old cartoon.\\n\r\n2.NAKAMA POWER UP\\n\r\nI said I would keep it short so all I'll say is this. When a character has lost 99.999% of the fight , you CANNOT find that 00.001% and add in \"friendship power\" in every single fight. I know other animes do this, but go damnit if Fairy Tail doesn't do it the most.",

            "content": "Fairy Tail falls under the same category as many of the most popular anime in existence, namely One Piece, Bleach and Naruto, and because the shounen genre is never exactly rich in story or character depth, ive decided to be fair and rate this anime for what it is rather than comparing it to the likes of Cowboy Bebop and Steins;Gate, so please enjoy!\r\nIn a world where magic is part of everybody's daily life, we follow the story of Lucy Heartfilia; an aspiring wizard who-after meeting Natsu Dragneel- becomes a member of the wizard guild known as Fairy Tail.\r\nSeems pretty basic right? Well the storydoesn't get much more complex than thet until later on, which gives the viewer time to get attached to the characters and for the story itself to put all of the pieces in place ready for the last 20 or so episodes.\\n\r\nThe show is divided up into around 13 arcs, with the last episode of each arc having some form of impact on the Fairy Tail Guild that will be used as a plot point much later on.\\n\r\nThe art is really well done, but repetitive, the most noticeable of which are Erza's transformation, Lucy's gate calling and Natsu's Fire Dragon Powers, but   eventually you become used to them and they dont become painful to watch.\\n\r\nthe battles are also amazing to watch, which comes as no suprise considering this genre of anime iare the masters at long, drawn out yet visually impressive battles, and last but not least, most of the character designs are also very creative and well drawn, with the female characters being adorable and the male characters looking like the typical strong hero.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the sound, and most importantly , the sub and dub of the show, i really have no complaints; Todd Haberkorn (well known for playing Death the Kid in Soul Eater) does a brilliant job at nailing Natsu's fiesty but caring personality to a T and other heavy hitters such as Monica Rial playing the gorgeous Mirajane also do a fine job at nailing Mira's cutesy but serious personality, the japanese script was written to appeal to a slightly older audience than the american dub, with swearing and a much more aggressive tone added to Natsu and Erza, yet they seem to be missing or rewritten in the english dub to appeal to a much younger audience. I cant leave behind this part of the review without talking about Aya Hirano, who often worries me because when i hear her voice i think of so many other characters over the character she's trying to play, but for some reason i was able to look past that this time and can confidently say that she too does a really good job of turning Lucy into a damsel in distress character thats fully equipped with a fiery personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe character is where things start to get more complicated though, as, individually MOST of the characters have been given their own backstory and are well fleshed out, but when it comes to character relationships, things begin to slowly roll down hill.\\n\r\nThe show makes it blatantly obvious that characters are romantically interested with others, yet throughout all 175 episodes, nothing is done about it until the very last few episodes of the entire series; and even then nothing is resolved, only hinted at.\\n\r\nBack onto the subject of the story arcs, some are incredibly fun to watch but some become incredibly tedious after a while, thats because every arc follows the same formula;\\n\r\n-MC gets beat up by villain  \\n\r\n-Villain does something to MCs friends\\n\r\n-MC uses the power of friendship to overthrow the villain\\n\r\n-Villain get their ass whooped back to the stone age\\n\\n\r\nThis runs the risk of a person's enjoyment of the series to become very stale and thus people begin to drop the series, made worse by the fact that the best arcs are much later on (Edolas Arc starts on episode 76, Tenrou Island Arc starts on episode 96 and the grand Magic Games arc starts episode 150)\\n\r\nthis is a real problem if a show takes 75 episodes to really get going, aend thus enjoyment of the show will vary from person to person, but dont worry, its not like the series BEFORE episode 76 isnt good, its just doesnt really progress the plot.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, i really enjoyed watching this show, despite a pretty shaky start and a couple arcs that get kind of boring after a certain point, what you have here is 175 episodes of pure mindless fun and because it knows what it is, everything works brilliantly, my only problem comes with the cliffhanger ending, yes after 175 episodes the story STILL hasnt finished, luckily its re-airing in April, but it upset me that they didnt even finish the story arc.",

If you're the type of guy who loves action and fan-service, this anime/manga is obviously for you! \r\n--- Sorry, jokes aside. \r\nI'm not kidding when it's a great gateway for beginners, but even then you're going to have to grow up. Fairy Tail aims for little kids, but shows all the unnecessary content a kid doesn't need to see. Although I do enjoy its fan-service, the characters and the storyline is an overall bust. \r\nYou are introduced to a girl named Lucy Heartfilia, who claims that she wants to join a guild. Coincidentally, your main character Natsucomes in and this and that happens. The story now revolves around Natsu trying to find his father, Igneel. As it goes on, the main goal starts to disappear and Igneel is barely even heard of again.\\n\\n\r\nI'm currently reading the manga for the heck of it, and all I see is plot armor. There is no real threat posed in Fairy Tail. There is no point in asking, \"who's gonna win this fight?\". There's no point in even thinking while watching it. \\n\\n\r\nIf this review didn't influenced you, then I suggest you watch the show without thinking. It'll save your brain cells!",

            "content": "Fairy Tail revolves around a mage called Lucy Heartfilia and her guild Fairy Tail, embarking on adventures with themes revolving around friendship and family, to summarise it quickly.\r\nOkay Fairy Tail by any means is not fantastic and quite similarly too many mainstream shonen mangas (naruto, bleach and one piece) had many flaws, ass pull, bad character development and anti-climatic boss battles with the most clich\u00e9d main character ever. Let me just say though, I enjoyed the anime immensely whilst watching it but looking back at it, it just got worse and worse.\r\nStory 4/10\r\nThe setting was fantastic and a world I would have loved to livein, other than the fact of using magic and fighting, the guild is the essence of how a family should be like. Friends, camaraderie and all the good things about life, the universe and concept was fantastic to say the least.\\n\r\nAlthough what ruined it was the poorly written or annoying characters and the unnecessary fanservice in it and eventually the lack of care given to the characters. To focus on the plot first is that it repetitive. How? An arc follows this pattern; Job-mini-boss squad- gets owned- then all of a sudden after some motivational speech on friends etc- Natsu beats up the ultimate big bad whilst the rest finish off the mini-squad. It was that simple. Although in its defence, it shares the spotlight around slightly better than other shonen mangas, some other characters also get some pretty big crowning moments of awesome. \\n\r\nThe humour in the anime is also not fantastic, at first it might seem quite amusing but in hindsight now, the latter of the anime relies on fanservice waaaaaay too much for comedic sakes and thus made it slightly unbearable to watch.\\n\r\nAlso the ass pull in the anime, with the hope spot after the main character suddenly powers up with some really unbelievable method and an inspirational speech about friends, BAM! Villain gone good guys win with no serious repercussions. For example, one does not simply eat some nuclear rock and then suddenly power-up to defeat a villain who was kicking your ass previously. The motivational speeches were truly quite inspirational towards the start but it was overused so much it became somewhat annoying. Couldn\u2019t they find another way to win a battle? Although it is the main theme of the anime so I guess so slack could be given.\\n\r\nThe anime also has a habit of censoring all the blood and making the anime overly fluffy and happy. I understand that it\u2019s supposed to be happy and aimed at children but seriously you cannot go through a fight with a major fight and only come out with minor cuts and bruises, this enforces the unrealistic nature of the anime. Also how the anime just seems to refuse to kill off any characters, instead of giving them an epic death, the author just lets them sit in the background and rot away which I believe no character deserves.\\n\r\nCharacters- 6/10\\n\r\nThen the characters in the anime, most of them are poorly developed or overly annoying. First of all being the main lead Lucy, one of the most commonly bashed characters but not to show my bias, I have to agree as well due to the fact that she is useless. Her sole purpose seems to be for fanservice and appealing to male fans, I mean come on; she can\u2019t get through a single fight with her clothing intact. Also the situations she are put in to make her appear stronger and in retrospect to the other lead Erza, her primary purpose is for fanservice and shipping sakes. Perhaps if she was a minor character, I wouldn\u2019t have disliked her that much but the due fact that the arcs revolve around her and she doesn\u2019t do anything annoys me.\\n\r\nThen we have Natsu, your typical hero who has a food obsession, is impulsive and stupid, unbelievably powered and the guy who gives all the motivational speeches. Yeah, really annoying just by the simple fact that he isn\u2019t an original character with virtually no character development throughout the series.\\n\r\nThese are the main two character issues but I also have a major issue with the villains. A villain just can\u2019t seem to stay dead or stay gone, they always come back, remember Erigor in one of the first arcs? He appears at least two times later and then you have the members of Oracion Seis who just had to return for a filler arc and don\u2019t get me started on Jellal.\\n\r\nMy opinion is that it has too many characters and these characters aren\u2019t fleshed out to a good standard due to the focus on the four main characters, I mean what\u2019s the point of bringing them back if they don\u2019t change at all, other than becoming more powerful with no logical explanation?\\n\r\nBut then I did love certain characters in the anime and thoroughly enjoyed to see them in action so I couldn\u2019t rate it too badly.\\n\r\nArt- 7/10\\n\r\nNot the best art I\u2019ve seen but it was decent and considering the detail gone into those magic circles, some of the fight scenes looked pretty awesome although I wouldn\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t an highlight. Also sometimes it was slightly inconsistent, one second a character looks good, the next they are warped that they go from decently looking to pretty horrendous and in the latest the arc, the animation has dropped in terms of standards by quite a lot but that could be due to the lack of funding.\\n\r\nSoundtrack- 9/10\\n\r\nDefinitely an up for the anime. The soundtrack by Yasuharu Takanashi is plain awesome. With a variety of upbeat battle music to the slower emotional ones, it captures every scene perfectly and fits the anime. I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtrack and despite having a heckload of songs in each, it was worth my time converting all the songs onto my ipod.\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 7/10\\n\r\nYeah, I know I rated the anime pretty low but I did finish every episode within the period of a month and enjoyed it immensely. Maybe as this quote says \u201cWhether fairies have tails or not, or whether they even exist, nobody knows for sure. So it's like an eternal mystery, an eternal adventure.\u201d An eternal adventure that doesn\u2019t end, there was always more jobs, always tough situations and it just doesn\u2019t end with a happy ending for most things. In a contrast to reality I think this was the reason why I enjoyed it, an eternal adventure, an escape.\\n\r\nFinal Score- 7/10\\n\r\nFor a long-running manga, it has its highlights and its detractors but based on everything I did get some form of enjoyment out of it despite the poor story line so I couldn\u2019t rate it too badly. It was decent for a shonen and not appallingly bad like some others.\\n\r\nYeah, I know I said quite a few negatives things about the anime but I judged it like any other anime and like any mainstream animes, it has the same flaws so I tried my best to ignore those tropes. 'Tried being the operative word'",

            "content": "Story: 5/10 The story is okay. I prefer more interesting & original story-lines, thrillers, anime with a strong plot and anime with a strong message behind it. Fairy Tail has neither nor any of those qualities. Instead, it has a very weak and repetitive plot. The story is also really clich\u00e9 and you can predict everything that will happen.\r\nArt: 6/10 The art is fair. It's not the best art I've seen and it's not the worst either. I think the art is very colourful and vibrant with visually appealing backgrounds and settings. I personally think that the character art have dropped the overall mark. \r\nSound:10/10 This is one of the anime with the best sound, sound effects and background music I've seen. The background music totally harmonizes with the contemporary theme and the sound effects clicks in at the correct time. The character's voices are clear and the voice actors have clearly done an excellent job. The openings and endings aren't really my thing but other than that, I don't have any complaints. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10 I liked how the characters have their own personality. However, I find their personalities to be too static and have very plain and simple personalities. I personally think that Fairy Tail characters will need more character development. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  10/10 It's not one of the anime I've enjoyed most but I quite liked watching Fairy Tail. I especially liked the humour in it... not to forget about the sound. I personally think Fairy Tail is a very s***ty anime but I really enjoyed watching it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 Overall, I've rated Fairy Tail a 8 out of 10. The sound is outstanding and it's a great comedy, magic and adventure anime.",

            "content": "Fairy Tail is probably the worst shounen of the big three, but its not the worst anime ever. This is an honest review and I am not hating. I will look at the good and the bad of the show.\r\nStory - (2/10)\r\nWhat story? Fairy tail is a string with cliches plots and fight scenes attached to it. It's as if Hiro Mashima wanted to add every shounen cliche ever, into his show, time skip, tournament arc, alternate universe. The entire story is predictable and so are all the fights, Natsu and his friends always win with the power of friendship which is horrible. Hiro Masimarefuses to kill off any of his characters (besides extensions ie. edo-Lisanna or future Lucy or ghost-like Mavis) You know the heroes will win in the end through overused tropes and cliches, so unoriginal.\\n\\n\r\nArt - (7/10)\\n\r\nThe animation is fine. It's very good during fight scenes, it's nothing too spectacular though.\\n\\n\r\nSound - (9/10)\\n\r\nI can't even lie. The soundtrack is amazing. The old European Irish style and flutes are nice. The Openings are so energetic and the endings are so calm and sad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - (3/10)\\n\r\nFairy Tail probably has the worst cast ever. I have never seen such one dimensional characters in an anime. Natsu and friends ALWAYS win. No mater what, no matter how unrealistic, through the power of friendship. Natsu is honestly the worst anime protagonist ever, he never trains or does anything and everything always works out fine for him. Villains are even worse, they have such one dimensional goals (take over the world muhahahaha!) and the worst part is how after losing in a fight against Natsu they automatically \"turn good.\" Like seriously, sociopathic murderers are totally kind-hearted and nice after losing in a fight.? really? Other than a butt kicking from Natsu, they also receive no punishment for their actions. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - (5/10)\\n\r\nI think this is only reason why Fairy tail is popular is because its enjoyable. The fight scenes are fun and show is sometimes funny. People (not me) also enjoy the fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - (4/10)\\n\r\nOverall, Fairy Tail is a gigantic messed that looks like bad fanfiction. I recommend it to those who have no real taste in anything.",

            "content": "For the longest time, I was very reluctant to watch any Fairy Tail. The reviews I read were incredibly polarized, either praising it to high heavens or dooming it to the thrash heap. But no one can deny the huge popularity of the show, so after I was done with binge-watching many serious seinen/josei series, I needed some dumb fun, so after all these years I gave Fairy Tail a chance. After 130 episodes, I'm still not sure I made the right choice. Let me explain...\r\nRight after the first episode it was obvious Fairy Tail was designed by a committee to be TNBT (The NextBig Thing) in sh\u014dnen anime. Taking up the mantle from Dragon Ball, Pokemon, Bleach, One Piece and especially Naruto, Fairy Tail is the same \"fun for the whole family\" type anime. It uses the same exact recipe, one main protagonist, many typecast side-characters, all part of the same group, and they go on adventures, defeat evil in spectacular eye-candy fights, for justice and camaraderie, etc. We all know how it goes. \\n\\n\r\nBut Fairy Tail brings a few twists into the mix. First of all, it tries a new format. Instead of incredibly long, drawn out arcs and fight scenes to draw out the run time, it operates with a machine gun for content. The story arcs are short but there are an incredible number of them. This eliminates boredom, but does get a little old after while, when it seems Natsu and gang saves the world from some new apocalypse five times a week. Same goes for fights, which are \"short and sweet\", never get boring or outstay their welcome. They do repeat things a lot, but at least we don't have to watch the protagonist \"gather power\" for twenty episodes for that one special attack, grinning through the exertion like he is about to soil himself. When Natsu says \"you're gonna get it now!\", he really means NOW, not four months later, which is kind of refreshing. It seems the creators really did their best to come up with new stories, enemies, arcs and fight sequences for every episode, without reusing much of them, which is very commendable, but I wonder how long they can keep this up...\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that helps this process is the incredibly lax laws of Fairy Tail's concept. This is an anime where literally everything goes, from easy going adventure, happy fun times, heated and serious battle, unimaginable evil, crying, death, pain and suffering, oh, and also dragons, flying cats, flamboyant wizards, fan-service boob parades and The Butt Jiggle Gang. There is practically no limit on the imagination here. This makes the series less boring than any sh\u014dnen adventure series I watched so far, but also a little inconsistent and sometimes hard to follow.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing is the series tone. In short, it's all over the place. Fairy Tail is incredibly self-aware when it comes to humor. Sometimes it's smart and witty, but largely it's goofy, slapstick and low-brow as far as kids anime gets,  uses lots of pop-culture references, tons of fan service and it breaks the fourth-wall so frequently it might as well not be there. This makes the series largely really fun, and makes for some great \"laugh out loud\" moments. The only problem is, the creators don't seem to know the biggest secret of humor is TIMING. They frequently ruin serious or emotional moments with jarring slapstick bits, bad puns or just pathetic scripting. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not just the humor, though, but the way the series never really takes itself seriously. Yes, it's not a bloody, gory, cursy seinen series, but sometimes Fairy Tail takes \"family friendly\" a little too far. All the characters are wearing \"plot armor\", even the antagonists, so no one dies in fights, or gets hurt worse than a few boo-boos. This makes for some very anti-climactic fights, when you know just how low the stakes are. When the enemy gets \"defeated\" it only means they get knocked out for a while, after which they usually come to and grumble about being defeated. That said, the biggest hurdle for me is when the enemy turns out to be a good guy in disguise, which happens with alarming frequency. Many times during big, epic fights, the antagonist gets something hidden revealed about their past or the situation at hand, and they instantly turn into good little puppies, stopping everything in it's tracks, which is the cause of some the most jarring anti-climactic endings I've ever seen. \"Me trying to murder you all and take over the world, it was all just a misunderstanding, I'm not evil, I'm actually a good guy, honest!\". Worse yet, many of them turn out to be flat out heroes. And the protagonists just go along with it EVERY TIME, without question. \"Oh, no biggie, you didn't manage to murder EVERYONE or destroy EVERYTHING, so I guess we forgive you. Hey, now that you are not evil, how about joining us?\". And that happens more times than I can count. This releases the carefully built tension with a wimpy fart-noise instead of a BANG and makes many of the story arcs really lackluster and unsatisfying in the end.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters serve their purpose. That's about the best thing I can tell about them. The protagonist, Natsu Dragneel, is a Naruto wannabe, with a lot less personality and a lot more annoyance. The typical absolutely clueless, but incredibly powerful adolescent manchild, who is incredibly high-strung, always rushes into battle without any amount of thinking, gets his ass kicked, then gets up heroically and defeats the enemy with one last spectacular attack with the power of friendship/love/family/courage/cookies/refrigerator/whatever. Rinse, repeat. BORING! Same goes for the rest of the pathetic cast, which are all typecast trope-factory rejects, fan service bimbos, prissy tsundere, cutesy moe and talking chibi animals. The clich\u00e9-meter is so off the charts, it's insane.\\n\\n\r\nBUT!\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is a big but, because with all that said, surprisingly enough, Fairy Tail is...FUN! A huge amount of fun, in fact. I can't really put my finger on it, because if I look at the individual parts, the story, the characters, the world, etc, it SHOULD be a huge trainwreck, a bad flop. Fairy Tail should have crashed and burned before if even started. And yet, somehow it works! The incredibly cheesy and pretentious story, the goofy, slapstick, fourth-wall-breaking humor, the huge amount of low-brow fan-service and the characters, kings and queens of Clich\u00e9 Mountain, it all somehow comes together to form something really fun and entertaining. The fast paced, varied, no-nonsense story and action is very captivating, and the weird humor somehow does work, despite ruining many of the serious and emotional moments. As I said before, Fairy Tail is very self-aware and seems to wear it's faults and shortcomings like a badge of honor, with a knowing wink to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nMost of all, what makes this series for me is THE MUSIC. It's simply incredible! And I'm not talking about the OP or the ending, but the backing tracks! I always liked metal music, but Fairy Tail's background music is simply awesome! The celtic-style flace-flaying heavy metal suits this series incredibly well and elevates what could've been a mediocre schlock to a really enjoyable experience, at least for me. Fairy Tail's OST now dominates my favorite anime music top list, and with good reason. Most anime series have one or at most a few good songs, but this time THE ENTIRE OST is pure awesome, which is very surprising for me. The thunderous, shredding metal makes every fight scene at least twice as epic! Huge thanks for the musicians who made these!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Fairy Tail is a weird mix of utter nonsense, that somehow comes together to form a very enjoyable experience and it's so immensely popular with good reason. On paper, it shouldn't be. It's pretentious, pedantic, goofy and a huge amount of dumb fun that never seems to end. If you are ever tired of high-brow, intense and meaningful seinen/josei series, give Fairy Tail a spin to clear your palate or just take it as something to watch on a boring afternoon.",

            "content": "Okay, so I wanted to write a review about Fairy Tail for a while, and here it is.\r\nHonestly I nearly dropped the show after a few weeks. The story is just your average shounen, nothing really outstanding yet. The art is only slightly above average, the magic circles look kind of weird and the fights aren't as intense and well animated as they could be. So normally this would have been dropped by me, as many other average to slightly good shounens.\r\nHowever there were three things that kept me hooked, and these are the main things I want to talk about here.\r\nFirst, and this isonly for the fanboy in me, this show does not only have Hirano Aya, but also Kugimiya Rie. That alone was enough for me to keep me interested for a while, and if your a sucker for their voices like me, then you'll probably really like the interaction between Lucy and Happy. As for the other voices, they are generally quite good too.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing I really enjoyed about Fairy Tail are the characters. Most of the mages in Fairy Tail and especially the main characters are either awesome, funny or both. They are not to deep characters, but Erza, Lucy, Natsu, Grey and Happy as the main bunch are really enjoyable, so are the others like Juvia or Makarov.\\n\\n\r\nBut what really kept me watching the show is the music. This anime has one of the best background music I've ever heard. Nearly every piece of music is memorable and extremely well down. From Irish Folk like pieces over Pop/Rock themes to pieces with influence from Symphonic or Power Metal the soundtrack is simply perfect. They could probably show a few stick figures doing their laundry and I would still watch it just because the music is so great. They could even air a discussion of your local parliament and with this music it would seem like an awesome battle. Almost everytime a new piece of music starts I can feel shivers running down my back. The music in this anime is just outstandingly good.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you are interested in shounen I would suggest at least trying Fairy Tail. It is a fine show, with a few flaws and an unbelievable awesome Sound.",

            "content": "Ok, I watch Fairy Tail because everybody say it's similar to One Piece or FT is ripping off One Piece. Here are my thoughts from a One Piece fan point of view.\r\nStory: 6\r\nWhen I just start Fairy Tail, I was REALLY excited. A world of magic where everybody (mostly) have unique magics (just like One Piece Devil Fruit ability). Then they are in a guild with lots of colorful characters and a request board where they can do quests and earn money. I thought, wow, that's a really good base for some creative and unique story. But unfortunately, their adventures are kinda lacklusture compared toOne Piece's. One Piece really had some amazing adventures (Sky island, desert kingdom, haunted island, fishman island under the sea etc). But I understand Fairy Tail is a lot more condensed. Each arc normally last only about 20+ episodes. One Piece is focused on Luffy's ambition to become the Pirate King. Fairty Tail's main objective is.. Natsu's search for Dragneel?? (I'm really not sure). \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is Fairy Tail is pretty conservative and stick to those typical modern anime. It'll appeal to wide range of audience. I know a lot of people are turned off by One Piece's unique art. One thing that really bugs me is the amount of fan service in the later part of the story. Lucy just happen to get her shirt torn off in every battle. I'm ok with fan service, but when it happens in a battle, it's hard to take it seriously. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThis is not my forte. I don't really research much on voice actor/actresses. My impression of the music is good, the celtic style music suits the whole magic theme. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThere are lots of colorful characters in this anime. And their interactions are funny. Most if not all of the major characters have their background story. And Mashima had a lot of planning put into this, when you will find out how he/she got her name, or why he/she act that. But maybe Mashima put too much effort into this when one of my reaction when knowing how Erza got her name I was like.. \"Come one..\". However, the characters are not that wacky or as distinct as in Once Piece. And Erza's background is similar to Nico Robin, but Nico Robin seems so much stronger becuase Erza dwell too much about her past. It's sad because she should be the tough one.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThe fighting in Fairy Tail is not really intense. Since most of them will be done within an episode. My favorite battle is when Mirajane is fighting =). It really eclipse even Natsu's battles. The jokes in FT is pretty funny, and the huge number of characters are fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nOverall, I had high hopes when starting this anime, my enthusiasm slightly wane during the middle. It's a good anime, don't get me wrong, I even read the manga after I caught up to the anime since I want to know what happen next. Just don't predict this anime, because there are too many \"ohh.. ok..\" moments, like the author making up his own rules along the way. But that's to be expected in \"magic\" world right??",

Or at least borderline shit I should say?\r\nWhat first attracted me to Fairy Tail was it's lightheartedness, humor, cool action,  decent plot, and cool adventures. Watching it was very entertaining. \r\nBut after awhile, everything became predictable. The humor is still there, but the plot and fighting scenes turned childish. Without those two elements, the whole series practically fell apart and it felt as if everything in this series had NO REAL MEANING to it. Every battle is won with the \"power of friendship.\" No one dies.Everything always works out fine and no one is harmed. Same characters always win. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. That is Fairy Tail. There are a bunch of rage-inducing moments that I have watched in this series. \\n\\n\r\nBut in all honestly, had the series ended before the Oracion Seis Arc, I would have given it a 10.",

            "content": "Fairy tail might just be the worst battle shounen out there, it starts out looking like it has some potential but drags on for so long without doing anything with it's premise.\r\nStory:\r\nNatsu a fire dragon slayer mage gets Lucy to join Fairy tail. Fairy tail is a magic guild, but it's not any ordinary magic guild. Fairy tail is the only place on earth where friendship exist and it allows Fairy tail members to magically beat anyone without any logical reason even if their enemy is supposed to be much stronger than them. Thus whenever any Fairy tail member reminds themselves of their friends theyinexplicably gain a power boost that allows them to one-shot anything. Throughout the anime they keep facing random groups of generic villains and beat them in the most contrived manner. Natsu, the main character, is supposed to be searching for his dragon father but instead he does nothing to advance his plot for the entire show. The arc structure barely makes sense, character motivations don't make sense, and the story keeps digging plot holes as it goes along.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAlmost all characters in Fairy tail, even the main character, are one note characters. Everyone has a single quirk that defines them and is constantly played as a joke like Gray undressing, Juvia loving Gray, Cana drinking, Levi is flat, Natsu and Gray like to fight, Erza is unstoppable, etc... and that joke is repeated over and over as if it's going to be funny at some point. Character development isn't present which is to say that Natsu and Lucy at the start of the series are the exact same as the ones at the end. The only character that seems to have character development is Erza and it's more like a degradation than development. All villains are designed to be generic unlikable characters and the writer gives them no respect, making them fall like garbage whenever he decides it's time for the main characters to win the fight.\\n\\n\r\nFights:\\n\r\nFairy tail fights are abysmal. Most of them follow a specific formula: Villain too strong > Main character gets beat up and things look hopeless > Main character remember friends/promise/past and suddenly gets more powerful > Main character one-shots villain. When it comes to fights no one can beat Fairy tail no matter what. The animation of the fights aren't any good either. Abilities are meaningless in Fairy tail, that is to say no matter what your ability is it gives you no tactical advantage as there are no tactics in Fairy tail and battles are resolved through which character has more brute strength. It doesn't matter which magical element you have as long as it's stronger. Power ups are random and contrived.\\n\\n\r\nComedy and Fanservice:\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before Fairy tail repeats the same unfunny jokes every time. Fanservice jokes are also overused. There isn't a girl character in Fairy tail that isn't oversexualized and under-dressed at some point.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, while mediocre Fairy tail doesn't seem that bad initially, it only starts to be the worst when it keeps repeating the same fights/jokes/friendship speeches/unnecessary fanservice/generic characters over and over again that it became its own shitty formula.",

The story becomes repetitive and the characters do not develop! You don't see them training hard enough, even with the 2 year time-skip. The comedy is getting less and the fan service more. \r\nYou can obviously see the anime pushing between pairings. To me, that's not something I like. \r\nUnlike most top anime's, the endings are always predictable. Natsu mentions Nakama and suddently gains plot armor, wins and that's that. He is shown to beable to defeat anyone, even when it doesn't make sense how he could defeat him.  After the battle, he doesn't develop nor does anyone give him recognition for what he has done. One of the worst parts for me is that he has no goal. Luffy want's to be the Pirate King, Naruto the Hokage. What is you're goal Natsu? Nothing. With no goal or actual aim for the show, it might remain longer, but with no development. \\n\\n\r\nP.S He only mentiones finding Igneel, which bothers me a lot, since he doesn't even care about his REAL parents.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 6/10\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\r\nSound : 9/10 (Music is nice BTW)\\n\r\nCharacter : 4/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOver all : 6/10",

It's another run-of-the-mill, \"good guy overcomes the odds without really explaining why or how he got there\", \"friendship conquers all\" anime. Are the characters very deep or develop well? Not really. Does the story progress? Yes. Does it feel like any progress is being made? Nope.\r\nHowever, if there is one thing that Fairy Tail is, it's enjoyable. As cliche and underdeveloped as the characterscan really be, they're fun and lovable. As simple and underwhelming as the story can be, it's easy to follow and doesn't take much if any effort to follow or get in to.\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail is what I'd love to call my \"chill\" anime.

Bored at home and want something to do? Watching Fairy Tail.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, just watch it. If you're super into story or character development, it won't be your cup of tea.

(rune magic for example) there are many spells that feel that they are just there because the author wanted to create this type of scenario rather than being consistent.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nNo complains here but still not my favorite. The animation is well done and the art has a good style to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nOne of the best soundtracks i have heard in a while. they are many memorable songs and they really give an awesome mood to the show. definitely one of the reasons that made me stick to the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\ncharacters are fine. they is little development in the 175 episodes that i have watched as i said before. however this is not a big deal. my biggest complain about character is that they are over ridiculed. by this i mean they tend to exaggerate certain ridicule characteristics like Natsu's inability to ride vehicles or gray stripping (and everybody overreacting to it). i mean they are fun and all it just that sometimes it is too extreme.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nmy main problem is that often a very serious and epic mood is broken by a bad placed joke (the scene cut animation also help in this). don't get me wrong i really enjoy comedy i just think that placing comedy in the middle of the climax is really mood breaking. other than that the series was pretty enjoyable. i have to admit that i watched some of it fast forwarding some parts because of redundancy but that was ok.\\n\\n\r\noverall: 7/10\\n\r\nA series that you can enjoy but not a masterpiece at all or something i will put in my favorite list.",

            "content": "To begin with, I don't usually watch action-packed and long animes because it's just too time consuming and I'm not a great fan of fights but when i watched Fairy Tail, i began to question myself about my tastes.\r\nOkay to begin with, I find the story plot of fairy tail, very unique and original. Unlike Harry Potter and other fanatsy based animes, they don't use wands for once! Like you just get so sick and tired of wands after a while. Anyways, the plot is excellent because it has comedy, action, fantasy, a tad of romance which is a very good combo. So 10/10 forthat.\\n\\n\r\nSecond of all the characters are all different and have a wide range of personalities. I would say, even the antagonists of the story are very well portrayed. It's easy to make you hate the villan but in Fairy Tail, you will come to sympathise or even begin to like (like me) the villans. All of the characters in the story have some kind of tragic past which just peaks your interest. So i would say the characters are described much in depth. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nAnother wonderful thing about Fairy Tail is the character design. They all look stunning because most of the guys are hot (including the villans) but the down side is that the girls look pretty average. However, their outfits are quite nice and it usually changes every season or so (at least for one character). The most spectacular thing about the art are the backgrounds. They just look beautiful. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOkay, the best thing i think which makes Fairy Tail stand out is their OST. Their background music always fits the scene and is very catchy. Everytime i listen to their battle theme music, it just makes my blood boil and it just feels so epic and cool. Fairy Tail has one of the best and most unforgettable OSTs out their. Though the downfall is that the opening and ending themesongs aren't that great.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, Fairy Tail is by far the best anime I've watched. It doesn't lose to Bleach, Naruto or KHR who all have heaps of filler eps. FAIRY TAIL DOESN'T HAVE FILLER EPS! So a great anime, with great music and great plot. My final word: A must watch. \\n",

            "content": "Story: The story was decent but irritated me at times. For example, the many missions Natsu & Friends did that didn't develop any character or change the story, the many filler episodes, the weak characters of the, apparently, 'Strongest Guild', and mostly, the Timeskip. I really don't know what Fairy Tail was really aiming to do, their goals and whatnot but I do know that Natsu was aiming to find Igneel, the Dragon, everyone else, I don't know. The reason why my rating is 3/10 is mostly because of the many cliches in the anime. Ex: Fanservie characters (Virgo), abusive parents (Lucy), Parentless childhood (Natsu,Dragneel, Wendy, Erza), and mainly PLOT ARMOR. It's not even a coincidence the characters survive death so many times because there is a tree on an island that makes it so that anyone with the Fairy Tail Mark CANNOT die, ever. Another reason (my main reason) for my low score is the Time Skip. When I was watching the episode after the Time Skip when Fairy Tail returns, I was so excited to see all the characters 7 years older and how much stronger they've become but then, Fairy Tail spits in my face to tell me that the members of Fairy Tail didn't improve at all and has actually gotten weaker than before, with the remaining member of the guild just sitting around getting fat and not training at all for 7 years.\\n\\n\r\nArt: the art wasn't \"Oh my god, this is the most beautiful thing i've ever seen\" but it wasn't the worst art i've seen. I guess you can say it's on par with the art of Naruto (Original) 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: I loved the soundtrack to Fairy Tail, everytime I watched an episode and heard the openings, it left me wanting to watch more episodes (Up until the Timeskip, of course.) The Voice Actors were well-picked and the battle music wasn't bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: At the beginning of Fairy tail, (Ep 0-20) Natsu and Lucy fought Virgo. When they fought her, they struggled and had a hard time beating her. Lucy now has Virgo under her command. Currently, Virgo is a piece of crap who Lucy never uses and is not strong against enemies. From that time to the timeskip, Natsu, Lucy, Erza, Gray, none of them trained at all but you're telling me, they can fight on Par with a guild leader, let alone, Gildarts?\\n\r\nI don't like how none of the characters train but get stronger randomly without any sort of Shounen-type train (500 Pushups don't count)? I give the Characters, without getting specific, a 5/10 for the stated reason.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed Fairy Tail, it was a pastime for me. I enjoyed it at a 7/10 right up until the Timeskip. When the timeskip happened, I felt like stealing the last 100 episodes back and using the time it took me to watch it on actual schoolwork that I skipped. Let me put it this way, beofore the timeskip, Fairy Tail wasn't even the strongest guild. Why the hell would they get to be frozen for 7 years while everyone else gets overwhelmingly older/stronger than all of Fairy Tail? Think of it like this, in just 2 years, characters from One Piece 5 times stronger than they were previously so in 7 years, the characters from One Piece would be blowing up continents at that point. So from 7/10, my score lowers to 4/10 just because of the Timeskip.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Fairy Tail is a 6/10, I am NOT going to finish watching/reading due the senseless timeskip.",

            "content": "I think one thing people need to keep in mind when watching Fairy Tail is that it is an adventure shounen. There will not be much character development. Nobody will die. This is literally made strictly for people who like watching action fights, interesting arcs, and the occasional emotional outburst that may or may not make your heart melt, depending on the type of person you are.\r\nThat being said, Fairy Tail is one of my favorite animes. Many people like to compare it to One Piece, because they are similar. In my opinion, I like Fairy Tail better, but only because I just recently startedcatching up on One Piece, whereas many people have been watching it for years. I understand that can make one attached to an anime, so understand where I'm coming from when I say I like FT better, because I've been watching it for a much longer time. \\n\\n\r\nNow, for the actual review. The animation is alright to be honest. I've seen animes with much better animation, and I've also seen some with much worse. This is in-between, and it's not a deal breaker. I still love the show despite it's flaws. \\n\r\nThe characters are probably my favorite ever. They all share deep bonds and would naturally die for each other. Over the years I've grown emotionally attached to them, because they're over all just good people. Their unity is in friendship, which can solve all problems in this show. If you're someone who does not go for that kind of stuff, don't watch this. You'll hate it. \\n\r\nThe sound is pretty good. I have grown to love Fairy Tail's OSTs, so I am very biased when writing this. I've enjoyed this anime a lot. I've gotten a lot of feels from both reading the manga and watching the episodes. I'll admit that one of the arcs (Starry Heaven) was a bit dull for my taste, and the fact that it went on for so long makes it worse. Other that that, this anime gets a 9/10 for me. \\n",

            "content": "Overview: \r\nIf you liked Naruto, Bleach, and other generic shonen titles, you could do worse than Fairy Tail!\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story takes place in an alternate world where magic is common and wizards have formed a number of powerful guilds. The strongest of these guilds is Fairy Tail, to which our main cast of characters belong. Fairy Tail is told in 10-20 episode story arcs where usually Natsu and company must complete a new mission and fight a new adversary. That or its a tournament arc. Gotta have a tournament arc in every shonen since Dragonball. The story isn't bad, but it gets repetitive and Ihave a very good feeling that it won't end for at least another decade of the same thing over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail has a large collection of characters. It is unfortunate that the least interesting characters get the majority of the screen time. Natsu is a very bland and generic shonen hero. Lucy and Gray are annoying as hell and I can't stand either of them! Of course the worst character is Happy, who makes me want to bash my face repeatedly against a concrete wall. Remember Puar from DBZ? Make him 10x more annoying and stick him front in center in EVERY FUCKING EPISODE! That is Happy! Some characters like Erza, Mirijane, and Makarov are actually quite fun, and makes me wish I could see more of them instead of Lucy's whining, Gray's fan service, and Happy's... just everything he says and does.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't really say the soundtrack left a huge impression on me. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorably great either. I suppose it performs adequately.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Fairy Tail is pretty good for a 200+ episode shonen series. It isn't the greatest in the history of anime or anything, but it certainly is above average. Especially for a slightly older viewer like me that lived through the god awful art and animation of most 90s and 80s anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI realize that shonen is aimed at a 12-17 demographic and as a 26 year old I am not the prime target. That is why I am gonna go easy on Fairy Tale here. It has a few enjoyable moments, but they are few and far between for older viewers, not to sound like a jaded old man. I think if I were 12 or so years younger, I would probably like Fairy Tail a lot more, and be far more forgiving of its flaws. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail is a very average series. I watched the first 40 or so episodes and don't really have the desire to watch any more. I don't dislike it by any means, but I didn't personally find it very stimulating or interesting. Maybe if it had Erza as the main character and was cut down to 26-52 episodes it would be a more memorable shonen action series. I think I would at least give it a 7/10 if it had gone that route. Alas, that is never to be.",

            "content": "I want to say that I don't find this anywhere near \"amazing\" or even \"good\", because it isn't.\r\nThe start of the episode is good, and understanding the Fairy Tail Guild maybe a bit... difficult, but they're lovable. I find the beginning of Fairy Tail a lot enjoyable up until the Phantom Lord Arc (Reason is that it introduces... other similar traits like the main character, I should say). After that, it was just bring moments after another. It has character knowledge, and I'm perfectly good with that (for example: The reasoning behind Gray stripping). The arcs are not enjoyable after the Phantom Lord Arc, andI cannot put myself to think there are any decent ones.\\n\r\nOverall, there are some arcs that I happened to enjoy (even fillers).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters on the other hand... not so much. Natsu (main character) is such a poorly designed character. Lucy is shown to be an interesting character in the beginning of Fairy Tail, but eventually gets turned into a product of Fanservice.\\n\r\nTo prevent myself from going on and on, I will have to say the only characters that interests me are: Gray, Master Makarov, and Gajeel.\\n\\n\r\nAllow me to just put up my pros and cons for Fairy Tail:\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Amazing soundtracks. I just love it, especially most of them are pleasant to the ears.\\n\r\n-Setting of the story is great. I cannot deny that one.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Plot is horrible. It's just a cliche'd format just like the previous ones, one after another (Natsu/Fairy Tail gets beaten'd by villains, villains lose round 2 by Natsu/Fairy Tail by Nakama Power)\\n\r\n-Poorly designed characters. I don't mind Natsu being an idiot, but man he's way too overpowered. Then Erza, who can use a magic that changes her armor/weapon, has a special armor in her gallery called \"Plot Armor\".\\n\r\n-The \"S**t just got real\" moments ruined by stupidity. This alone ruined the potential Fairy Tail had (For example: Natsu faces an opponent, his \"friend\" does something that triggered him and both of them are fighting each other while Natsu's opponent is literally staring at him).\\n\r\n-Fanservice... this is another reason why Fairy Tail's potential is ruined.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Fairy Tail needs to have its plot worked on, drop the fanservice and stupid moments (It's one thing if these moments happen in appropriate places, such as the Fairy Tail Hall). Once Mashima can do that, then I can reconsider my opinion. Otherwise, I would highly recommend people to watch/read Nanatsu no Taizai (I guess you could say it's the series that Fairy Tail should have been).",

            "content": "I do NOT recommend watching Fairy Tail to anyone looking to begin it or want to start anime for the first time. Fairy Tail's only magical ability is to bore you snotless before conveying your broken body back to watching Netflix Originals.\r\nThis was my first ever long anime series, and how ashamed of that I am. I'd much rather it had been One Piece, Bleach or Naruto; at least those have plot consistency and do not rely on fan service anywhere near as much as Fairy Tail does. \r\nLet me start off by saying...\r\nFairy Tail is the most clich\u00e9 and formulaic anime to ever exist.The most. You looking for repetition to the nth degree, so much so that an entire arc feels like an 1000 episode brainbuster from the top rope?\\n\r\nPssh. At least writing a Fairy Tail review will satisfy my pessimism. And before Fairy Tail's dull memories finally fade from my mind.\\n\\n\r\nStory (1/10):\\n\\n\r\nTerrible. From start to finish, this is the worst story I have ever bothered caring about. You thought Sword Art Online had some inconsistencies, but at least it does not recycle the same arc formula over and over and over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nIn case you don't quite get it:\\n\r\n> Hang around in the guild for a bit, feels like a filler but it's not\\n\r\n> Someone goes missing / accept a bounty\\n\r\n> Spend way too long getting there\\n\r\n> Maybe some fodder, if not it's probably a flashback scene\\n\r\n> Bad guys destroy good guys for a bit\\n\r\n> Good guys use 'friendship' to get advantage\\n\r\n> Main bad guy comes out\\n\r\n> Natsu's friendship ftw\\n\r\n> Bad guy turns good\\n\r\nRinse, repeat\\n\\n\r\nEvery arc is like this, just at different lengths. As much as I wish I was exaggerating, this is probably an understatement. If there was at the least some diversity, or if some of the wizards did independent missions without there being groups of generic evil wizards, the story would be much more flavoursome. \\n\r\nI'm supposed to respect the Fairy Tail mangaka as an all-time great, despite producing this horse manure?\\n\\n\r\nAny of the sad or fatal moments in Fairy Tail make no sense with the plot; there is always a better way to deal with everything that they somehow cannot come up with. The only thing consistent about Fairy Tail's story is how terrible it is.\\n\\n\r\nYou want an anime with a good story? Go look at the top rated anime instead of the most popular.\\n\\n\r\nArt (4/10):\\n\\n\r\nHas boobs, which gives it 3 points instead of 1. Just kidding; really liked some of the effects produced by magic and some of the character's outfits. Mirajane by far as one of the coolest outfits (you know which ones I mean).\\n\\n\r\nSound (3/10):\\n\\n\r\nJust your average shonen soundboard stuff. Does anybody really care about this? I mean, come it's Fairy Tail.\\n\r\nThere's maybe about... 3 good OPs, all the rest just sound the same. God help you if you bothered sitting through the endings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nThey couldn't have pushed the idea that Natsu is the protagonist further down our throats, despite also wanting us to respect the rest of the Fairy Tail guild as equal protagonists, when it is always Natsu who defeats the main antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the point in building up such a strong, diverse and promising range of characters for them to just be hindered by a generic protagonist who has a generic power? Such a shame. I love Fairy Tail's roster of characters a lot, some have interesting backgrounds, magic and stuff.\\n\r\nFanservice also ruined a lot of the characters as well. Erza's a prime example of this; poorly done tsunderes does not make your anime better.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Kagura from Fairy Tail is just a blatant rip-off from Gintama's Nobume. Running out of ideas are we, Hiro-san?\\n\r\nMaybe you should have picked up comprehensive writing skills from Gintama too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10):\\n\\n\r\nI don't detest, hate or wish death upon Fairy Tail. But I certainly don't forgive it for giving me my lowest standard for anime. Thank god it's ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10):\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail didn't have my bawling in tears or anything, although it did make me crack a smile at times. Smiling to mask the pain of knowing I wasted time on this anime.\\n\r\nThank you for showing me what's on the opposite end of the spectrum from Gintama, Steins Gate and the like.\\n\r\nMaybe I'll finish the final series just to see if it finally breaks its shackles. Can only imagine it's gotten worse.",

'Cause they have the Powa of Friendship!\r\n*Fairy Tail wins.\r\n*End of arc\r\n*repeats the cycle\r\n Is that all they could do?  Meh. The story is poorly written so I'll just give it a 3/10.\r\nCHARACTERS:\r\nThis is irritating. Especially with Lisanna's part! Dude, she just came back and they be like nothing happened! On the other hand, Natsu's the same old Natsu. Thickheaded dragon slayer who obviously wins a fight every arc with his friendship power up of raging emotions. And Lucy andher celestial spirits. It annoys me how she summons them and the enemy's gonna beat them into a pulp. Aren't celestial spirits strong? (And to think that I was really expecting something from Lucy and Loke's relationship. Oh well.) Gray and Erza, they just gets dumber every episode. ESPECIALLY THE FIGHTS. At first, Fairy Tail's gonna give you an emotional fight mostly pertaining about to \"never give up\" / \"We are a family\" and suddenly... THE COMEDIC STUPIDITY RISES LIKE WTH ARE YOU SERIOUS?! Give me a break. I give 2/10. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe SOUND is good. The ART is okay. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I'm still watching this anime because it has something. A potential perhaps? Fairy Tail can be unique in many ways! So I can't just drop this one since I definitely love its manga.\\n\\n\r\nI think all of us, who watched Fairy Tail, could agree that it is funny. Its humor is one of its potential, yet it is also its downside when it comes to the seriousness part of every arc. But, I find the enjoyment good. I find some parts of this anime interesting so I'll give it a 6/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nExcluding its plot and character development. Fairy Tail is not that bad of an anime. Some may find it enjoyable, and some may not. And I'm still halfway through so maybe I'll edit this review if I see another significance in this anime. If you haven't watched Fairy Tail yet, please do. It is not that bad as most of the viewers think. And as for me, I'll still push through until its next sequel; Fairy Tail (2014).\\n\\n\\n",

Fairy tail is really funny it has comedy in every episode and i accually dont mind that the romance is very light if existant at all. The anime i would say is more comedy than anything else but the show accually has amazing fighting scenes and amazing characters because each different character has a different power,attitude and fan base. I really enjoyed this anime's fighting scenes so far plus the adventureis a nice touch to all the comedy and action. At first when your watching this anime youll think Oh its just another comedy anime with no real story line but you are so wrong. Each character is fighting for somthing and each character has their own problems and own past that is unique plus the anime has many suprises as far as the characters pasts go because each persons past is somthing you will never guess. I cryed afew times in the anime because as you get further into the anime you start seeing alot of emotional pasts that make you think of how mabey you would have reacted so its got alot going for it. Thank you and i hope you enjoy Fairy Tail",

            "content": "Fairy Tail succeeds as a shounen anime where others fall short.\r\nThe fight scenes are not 30 episodes long, but are fast paced and have the viewer constantly on the edge of their seat. Similarly, the story arcs are not so extensively drawn out that you start to wonder what it was that attracted you to the show in the first place. The story keeps moving and the audience stays interested.\r\nThe music is fantastic. During humorous or relaxing points in episodes, fiddle-Irish-folk type music adds a fun atmosphere to the show. The same type of music is executed in a more intense rocker way with electricguitar and the works. If Fairy Tail had nothing else going for it, the music could still carry the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are lovable and quirky. Rarely ever will you find yourself disliking a certain character.\\n\\n\r\nThe powers are awesome and diverse. You aren't just exposed to crazy planet destroying energy blasts here, and you probably won't miss anything of the sort.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're the type of person who doesn't like shounen, give Fairy Tail a try. It's definitely a breath of fresh air.",

            "content": "Oh look, it's an unpopular opinion! It seems like everyone just likes to rag on Fairy Tail because it's the cool thing to do. I'm not gonna lie, I'm guilty of talking shit about it just as much as everyone else but at the same time... there's no changing the fact that I genuinely did enjoy watching it quite a bit. Is Fairy Tail the worst battle shounen series out there? No. It really isn't. You mean to tell me that in the ENTIRE history of battle shounen anime, Fairy Tail has to be the worst one of them all? Come on... try harder, people!I'm sure some of the older otakus on this website who've watched hundreds of thousands of animes can think of several other programmes that are objectively worse than Fairy Tail. \\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong though, I understand WHY people like to rag on Fairy Tail. It does have some major problems and for what it's worth, even people in the fandom agree with that sentiment. At the same time, I think way too many people just focus on perpetuating the circle-jerk surrounding this series by parroting basically everything negative which has already been said about this series ad nauseum. Talk about irony. Meanwhile, I love how people talk shit about Fairy Tail and yet don't apply the same criticisms they levy to the programmes that they truly enjoy. Watching a Narutard talk shit about Fairy Tail is just as entertaining is like watching a DC/Marvel fan talking shit about manga.\\n\\n\r\n***THE CONCEPT AND SETTING***\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail takes place in a farcical world dominated by magic and follows the travels of a troupe of mages as they travel the globe on various missions and whatnot. Well, that's the condensed version anyway. One of the biggest problems that Fairy Tail has is the fact its arcs are very short, which is paradoxically its biggest strength to me (more on that in the next section). You see, Fairy Tail is one of those battle shounen animes where I'd really like to see more of the universe that this story takes place in explored but sadly it doesn't because one of its calling cards doesn't allow for it.\\n\\n\r\nI see people often comparing Fairy Tail to One Piece, but I feel like that's often made by people who've only taken a cursory look at both programmes and then come to the conclusion that they're virtually identical because they look similar, the leading males are both gluttonous idiots, and friendship is a shared theme. However, One Piece's claim to fame is an infinitely expanding universe which has a remarkable degree of complexity and thought put into the writing. This is obviously the case because the arcs are just as long as they need to be in order to allow each island the Straw Hats visit make their mark on the story. Fairy Tail's short arc length doesn't allow for any of that shit to happen whatsoever which is ultimately its biggest failing.\\n\\n\r\nI can forgive some of the more annoying running gags and the fan service to a large degree had there been a vast universe to explore, but from Episode 1 all the way to 175, that just wasn't the case. I'm not saying that the world that Fairy Tail remains completely stagnant from beginning to end, because there were *some* things that changed along the way, but nowhere near as much world-building as I had hoped for there to be. Really now, how could Hiro Mashima drop the ball on this one? I could easily think of several places along the way where the writing could've been improved to bring in some more insight on the world that this story takes place in but alack... another story of what could've been.\\n\\n\r\n***THE STORY***\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to that short arc length, the reason why I think that it's Fairy Tail's biggest strength in addition to being its most crippling flaw is because this makes the programme very easy to watch. Given the fact that I'm working full-time and have filial obligations, I lack the time and quite frankly the will to keep up with continuously overarching stories like I used to. Do you think that I'm up-to-date with One Piece? Oh HELL to the fucking no. I'm still like 100 chapters behind and even further behind with the anime. It's the fact that Fairy Tail's arcs are short and yet still packed with plenty of action and comedy to spare whilst also being able to take itself seriously if only for a brief moment when the time comes for it to do so which kept me around for so long.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, there are several glaring problems that Fairy Tail has when it comes down to the story writing. For one thing, a large portion of the writing feels recycled from other battle shounen anime. Rave Master, Dragon Ball, D.Gray-man, Soul Eater, Hunter x Hunter, Yu Yu Hakusho, InuYasha, Naruto, Bleach, Busou Renkin, Fullmetal Alchemist, One Piece, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, etc., these are all battle shounen anime/manga which have done pretty everything that Fairy Tail does but managed to do so better whilst also bringing something new to the table or at least managed to put their own spin on it so that the story doesn't feel like the same tired-out battle shounen formula. What really irritates me is that there are individual parts of the story which genuinely did have me interested but these individual elements were discarded in favour of marketability (short arcs full of action, comedy, and fan service is what this show is all about, right?).\\n\\n\r\nThe second biggest problem that Fairy Tail has with its story, the comedy. Yeah... comedy on the whole is a very subjective thing and despite being 25 years old, I'm no better than an overgrown man-child. I still find Beavis and Butt-head laugh-out-loud hilarious and sexual/vulgar humour still packs the same punch for me that it did back in middle school and high school. You'd think that I'd get a LOT of mileage out of Fairy Tail given that I'm an immature person, right? Well... not exactly. Natsu's extreme motion-sickness gets on my nerves more than Luffy's stupidity. It wasn't funny the first time, and yet Hiro Mashima and A-1 Pictures by extension still chose to keep that stupid gag throughout the entirety of its run. It's really the overuse of running gags which were never funny in the first place which dampens the comedy which is quite a shame because whenever Fairy Tail manages to get a laugh out of me, I burst out into uncontrollably loud and annoying cackling.\\n\\n\r\nThe third biggest problem that Fairy Tail has? Fan service. I really don't know what it is about battle shounen anime and having girls with huge racks and bizarre proportioning. I just don't find that shit attractive (Book 3, Chapter 5 of Avatar: The Last Airbender is my idea of fan service done right, but I digress). Also, this is just a personal gripe I have but why does Gray always have to be shirtless at least once per episode? For the girls to fawn over? Come on... at least make them wait for that shit. It loses its impact if it happens almost every single episode. Now if you're into girls with huge racks sporting plenty of cleavage and shirtless guys that are \"ripped,\" as the young people like to say it nowadays, I'm sure this won't be a problem for you but it is for me so too bad!\\n\\n\r\nI could go on to say that the battles rely far too heavily on power-ups, but I really don't give a shit about that since they're pretty damn entertaining to watch (especially given that battles are animated rather well) Besides, if you're going to rag on Fairy Tail for using power-ups and not levy the same criticism to programmes like Gurren Lagann, you're a waste of thought. People, this is a SHOUNEN series. By the end of it all, Fairy Tail is essentially the Japanese equivalent of Xiaolin Showdown: it's nothing more than mindless entertainment for sugar-high kids on Saturday mornings. Do you really think that there would be complex and intricate battles with all kinds of strategy out of something meant to be shallow entertainment?\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, it's time for something I like about Fairy Tail! When it comes down to its overall style, Fairy Tail knows exactly what it wants to be and it doesn't really set itself up to be anything greater than it actually is. If phrases could manifest themselves in anime form, Fairy Tail would be the embodiment of \"What you see is what you get. Don't like it? Well fuck off, we don't need you here.\" As far as shallow entertainment goes, there's plenty of it here. If you're the kind of person who wants something along the lines of Ulysses, Paradise Lost, or In Search of Lost Time, why the fuck are you expecting it out of Fairy Tail when its claim to fame is short arcs chock full of action, comedy, and fan service? That's just like expecting a culinary masterpiece out of McDonald's.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there is one thing that I have a bit of a gripe with and that's the fact that Fairy Tail basically ended on a rather nasty cliffhanger and that was basically your lot until A-1 Pictures came out with the second series which has received... let's just say \"mixed reception.\" Now granted, the second series DID come out almost a year ago and it's still rather early in the show's run. Let's just hope that A-1 Pictures gets their shit together before more circle-jerk reviews come into the picture. I could also rag on the filler, but let's face it: filler in battle shounen anime is prone to being terrible and there's no point in bitching about shitty filler in Fairy Tail when the filler in Naruto and One Piece is just as bad if not worse (well... more like padding in One Piece's case). \\n\\n\r\n***THE CHARACTERS***\\n\\n\r\nI just want to get this out of the way first: I don't like Natsu, I've never liked him, and he's REALLY annoying. The only battle shonen protagonist with an insatiable appetite who's also an idiot that I have the patience for is Luffy. Everyone else can go die for all I care. Throughout 175 episodes (and ~50 more in the new series), he has not changed a bit whatsoever. He's still all talk and no walk and the only time he can actually win a battle is with a power-up. I hate battle shonen protagonists like Natsu nowadays. The English dub makes him a good deal more tolerable since Todd Haberkorn is a great voice actor, but great voice acting can't help a shit-tier character. I'm sorry, Natsu fans. Gray 5evaaaaa.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Fairy Tail barring Natsu are all likeable to me, but the biggest problem I have with them is the fact that throughout the entire run of the series, they remain static as individuals. I like to see people grow and change over time in my programmes and mangas (although that little desire of mine can be overridden if the programme I'm watching is cool enough). From episode 1 all the way to 175, there is no significant changes that occur in the entire cast we hang around. Lucy, Gray, Natsu, et al are still the same as they were when they first started out. I mean, it's not all bad because at least they HAVE a sense of characterisation about them, but at the same time... I still think it's unforgivable that despite all the time that was put into this series, NOBODY has changed for the better.\\n\\n\r\n***THE ART/ANIMATION***\\n\\n\r\nArt-wise, I see a lot of people saying that it resembles One Piece's art style and well... as much as I'd like to disagree on that one, it's kind of hard NOT to notice Akira Toriyama's influence over the look of both of those series. I don't really mind the art style, and hell... I actually kind of like it but again: fan service just gets under my skin. Animation-wise, Fairy Tail was done by none other than A-1 Pictures, which I was rather surprised to see attached to a long-running battle shounen series like this one. When it comes down to visual quality, A-1 Pictures is no slouch whatsoever and they have programmes under their belt which are nothing short of eye-candy galore such as Blue Exorcist, Sword Art Online, and and both seasons of Magi.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a common occurrence in battle shounen anime for the animation quality to fluctuate quite a bit. Anything that isn't a battle may very well be animated with the same level of complexity as a flash game you'd find in the backwaters of Newgrounds. It's for that reason alone that I was caught off-guard when I saw that A-1 Pictures did a REALLY good job of keeping the overall animation quality across 175 episodes rather consistent. Yes, there are points where the animation takes a bit of a downward turn, but the rest of the series still looks remarkable from a technical standpoint. Battles are also animated exceedingly well which makes them nothing short of entertaining to watch, and you all know how much I love a well-animated battle!\\n\\n\r\nIt should also be mentioned that Satelight co-produced the animation alongside Fairy Tail. These are the guys who brought us Log Horizon's first season and the first four episodes of Hellsing Ultimate among other such viewing delectations. The fact that the animation quality remained more or less consistent across 175 episodes might have to do with the fact that there was more than one studio working on it. A-1 Pictures can't shoulder ALL of the burden, now can they?\\n\\n\r\n***THE SOUNDTRACK***\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes down to music, it's hard to find another battle shounen anime which comes anywhere close to Fairy Tail. This is something that EVERYONE can agree on. Like you can talk shit all you want about the story, the characters, and the art style but when it comes down to music... hot damn! The only other battle shounen anime I can think of that comes close to Fairy Tail would be Blue Exorcist, and even then I find myself leaning toward Fairy Tail's OST. I'm not even joking when I say that I actually had the 3rd OP saved as my phone's ringtone WAY back when I was just starting to get into Fairy Tail. Oh how I miss being a NEET living in Chandigarh. :(\\n\\n\r\n***THE DUB***\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes down to the sub vs. dub debate, don't buy into the dub hate that you might see here on the MAL forums. Funimation did an excellent job with the Fairy Tail dub. My favourite performances definitely come from Newton Pittman as Gray and Colleen Clinkenbeard as Erza. We also get some wonderful performances from the likes of Christopher Sabat, Brina Palencia, J. Michael Tatum, and other such Funimation regulars as supporting characters as well. I understand that there are a LOT of top-tier seiyuus involved with Fairy Tail but come on! The dub itself is some pretty damn good stuff too. Seriously, why so much dub hate?\\n\\n\r\n***ANIME VS. MANGA***\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough, I've never read the manga for Fairy Tail at all. I still say that if you're a manga purist, you're probably going to want to go manga rather than anime. Manga lacks filler, after all.\\n\\n\r\n***FINAL THOUGHTS***\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail is one of those anime series that receives WAY more crap than it deserves which is quite a shame. Look, I understand that it's popular and that popular series more often than not are overrated. That still doesn't give people the excuse to constantly make shitty reviews of the programme in question which basically parrot shit that's been said before ad nauseum. If you're in the mood for some shallow entertainment and nothing more that you can enjoy with your friends, Fairy Tail can definitely deliver on that front and keep you entertained for a good while. It's one of those programmes that I feel is best in small doses. If you know exactly what you're getting into, you should be fine. Hopefully, this review actually managed to sway some peoples' opinions on the programme but whatever. Chances are that it'll be downvoted into oblivion by diehard fanboys and haters alike. God, I need to pick a target audience and stick with it.\\n\\n\r\n***ALTERNATE ANIME RECOMMENDATIONS***\\n\\n\r\n1) InuYasha and its sequel series, InuYasha: The Final Act\\n\r\n- One of the most popular anime series of the early 2000s (especially here in the West), InuYasha is another anime series which consists of many small, easy-to-watch arcs. However, the biggest difference between InuYasha and Fairy Tail is the fact that InuYasha's small arcs all add up to an overarching goal whereas the arcs in Fairy Tail feel inconsequential for the most part. InuYasha is also a partially romantic story as well so there's also that. It also helps to mention that Fairy Tail is still an ongoing manga with a TV sequel which is still currently airing. InuYasha ended in 2004 and The Final Act ended in 2009. The manga also completed its run in 2008 with 553 chapters total.\\n\\n\r\n2) Gurren Lagann\\n\r\n- The bonds shared between Team Dai-Gurren is vaguely reminsicent of the friendship between Natsu, Gray, Lucy, etc. and power-ups are a huge part of each programme's battles (can you look at me with a straight face and NOT tell me that the Spiral Power ISN'T an excuse for constant deus ex machina?). However, Gurren Lagann opts for an extremely absurdist approach where logic and reasoning get thrown to the wayside in favour of being cool (as evidenced by Kamina's infinitely extending sword and his ability to pull his signature orange glasses out of thin air) whereas Fairy Tail doesn't really go that far with its fantasy elements. Also, the fan service in both series is similar... I mean, Yoko and Lucy pretty much serve the same purpose, don't they? Dem melons...",

            "content": "\u201cAlone, you feel nothing but insecurity; that\u2019s why we form guilds, that\u2019s why we have friends. We walk together in order to live a strong life.\u201d Makarov Dreyar, 3rd Master \r\nFairy Tail centres on the unity of souls, so to speak, and it emphasises how the bonds between friends can be worth more than blood ties. \r\nThe masters of the guild, Fairy Tail, all share the same belief that everyone has both light and dark in them, they need to be shown the right path. Stringing from this, many of the mages of darkness are affected by insecurities and their past. The producers actively contrastthem with mages of light (such as those in Fairy Tail) with similar insecurities. In turn emphasising the importance of trust and friendship. Another reason as to why some of the \u201cbad guys\u201d just cannot be hated, in fact some of them have slid their way into my many favourites. The contrast made me rethink my outlook on life and the judgment of others.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that many like about Fairy Tail, including me, is the manner in which these depths of life are hidden and entwined with scenes full of emotions- sadness, hatred, love and not to forget indignation. The last of the four is the most prominent theme of this anime, and is revisited with every arc. However, the producers have done an excellent job with lightening the mood every-so-often, with the characters and their personality, mainly featuring those of Fairy Tail.\\n\\n\r\nThe character most in focus is Lucy Heartfilia, who at first seems an add-on but as the story progresses you really get to understand her as a person and how strong her character really is, despite the \u2018blond moments\u2019. She is one character who shows the least anger and resent out of most characters and its surprising how she manages to do so (but I shall expand no more, otherwise I\u2019ll be bordering spoiler-zone and we don\u2019t want that do we, now? :p). \\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself starts off with our dear Lucy getting trapped in the most absurd situations and a Fairy Tail mage saving her\u2026you can find out who yourself when you watch it. They seem like her knight-in-shining armour and ironically she is a Princess herself! :p yup! You\u2019re in for a ball, my friend! Having said that, although this character is always there, Lucy doesn\u2019t always act as the helpless person, you would expect. This leads me on to character development\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is by far the best bit of Fairy Tail and each and every character is fully explored, the main ones more so, but that is to be expected. The director has certainly done his part with making Fairy Tail a success with this aspect. However, I\u2019ll have you know, that this anime is 175 episodes long so you are, no doubt, in for repetition. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t find this a problem until quite a decent number of episodes in i.e. if you\u2019ve been told that Fairy Tail is just a mush of different arcs with the same storyline, or thereabouts that\u2019s not entirely true. But of course, it\u2019s not a cup of tea for everyone! \\n\\n\r\nThe more detailed overall story is pretty obvious but there are times where the fillers take the spotlight and you might be lost as to what\u2019s happening. Personally speaking, this was one of the greatest flaws of Fairy Tail alongside the fan service that frequents as you near the end. But you get used to it! Personally I felt, that once you get into the anime and start admiring and understanding the characters, then you seem to enjoy the fillers more and more.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is something that is given divided opinion, since it is very bold and the details are present, although are not emphasised. This compliments and shines a spotlight on Fairy Tail as a guild, because they are notorious as a troublemaker guild, however they are the most welcoming and possibly the most forgiving. The fighting style is also influenced greatly by the art style and the underlying motives of the anime. Talking about creativity, the OPs and EDs are plentiful and are well suited to their arcs and some have even entered my list of favourites! They begin and end each episode making it complete and finishing the ideas that were started off, kind of like tying up loose ends. \\n\\n\r\nSo with all that blubber, my review about fairy tail comes to a close. Its such a huge series that being able to cover each and every aspect has been difficult, but hopefully I have wrapped it all off in my very first review! Beware of the over the top fighting scenes, though they really do get me going and some of them leave me laughing, the characters have a knack of doing that! The very last, incomplete arc leading to the second season will give you a very good idea of that! ;) ENJOY!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 8.5\\n\\n\r\nthecookiemonster\\n",

            "content": "First off, there is nothing original about Fairy Tail. The author just takes concepts and ideas from other battle shounen manga and rehashes them in Fairy Tail in a dumber way. Of course, to hide this thing, he also adds a lot of fanservice. So, whenever there isn't a fight going on, Fairy Tail will look pretty much like your average softcore porn cartoon. The story of Fairy Tail is fairly simple: the main protagonists go somewhere, encounter a villain who initially beats them up, then Natsu gains a power-up and wins. Repeat this formula endlessly and there you go, you have created a successfulway of milking the cash cow. Of course, other battle shounen anime use the same formula too, but at least they make the story flow better.\\n\\n\r\nAnother flaw of Fairy Tail is the lack of characterization. Simply put, the characters are not interesting enough. Most of them lack depth or personality, especially the females, whose personality flaws are compensated with giant breasts.\\n\\n\r\nThe good parts of this anime are its art and soundtrack. I have nothing against them. The fight scenes themselves are good, so is the color palette and the music.\\n\\n\r\nSo, overall, Fairy Tail is a very generic battle shounen that doesn't try to break the mold: it present the usual tropes found in other anime & manga of the same genre while adding some excessive fanservice.",

            "content": "Fairy Tail is the show that got me back into watching anime. It felt very nostalgic like I watching Toonami when I was a kid.\r\nFairy Tail follows the adventures of mainly Natsu Dragneel, Happy, Lucy Heartfilia, Gray Fullbuster, and Erza Scarlet. The young wizards are part of a guild called Fairy Tail located in the city of Magnolia. They take job request and most of the time they are trying to help Lucy make her rent. Along the way they get into conflicts with other guilds. The show has okay to good comedy and the fan service in this show can be a little toomuch but I digress. This show has intense action scenes and a story that will leave you entertained.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Fairy Tail is very good. However, like many other shows there are some scenes where the animation is outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Fairy Tail is very good most notably Colleen Clinkenbeard as Erza Scarlet and Todd Haberkorn as Natsu Dragneel in the Funimation dub. The music I thought was also good.\\n\\n\r\nThere are SO many great characters in Fairy Tail with unique personalities and magical abilities. Natsu Dragneel is a Fire Dragon slayer who is very gung-ho on going on dangerous jobs and picking fights with his guild members. He was also raised by Igneel and was abandoned by him in the year x777 on July 7th. Happy is a flying blue cat that is Natsu's buddy. Lucy Heartfilia is a celestial spirit mage who is very kind hearted but can be cold and rude at times especially with the guild members antics. She ran away from home and was heir to the Heartfilia family fortune. Gray Fullbuster is an Ice mage who has an unusual habit of stripping his clothes. Finally there is Erza Scarlet who can requip into different armor. She was a slave forced to build a tower and later joined Fairy Tail after she lead a revolt on the people who forced them into labor. Also there are some secondary characters that deserve mentioning like Juvia, Gajeel, Mirajane, Elfman, Wendy, and Master Makarov.\\n\\n\r\nI had a blast watching Fairy Tail. It has funny moments that will get a chuckle out of you and the story is just so intriguing that you just want to keep watching. Now there are a few problems I have with the show and that is they use the power of friendship WAY too much in this show and in doing so they get a power up and defeat the villain. Another is that some of the episodes have a little too much fan service and I don't mind fan service, but there has to be a point where it's just to much for an episode. Overall Fairy Tail is a great anime that is full of adventure, comedy, and action. It's also why I consider it one of my favorite anime's of all time.",

            "content": "First, I would like to say that I rated Fairy Tail for what it REALLY is : an entertaining shounen without any originality. Don't get it wrong, FT totally accepts that. That's why I can't compare it with my others favorites animes (HxH, FMA, ...). \r\nWhen I watched the first episode of FT, I exactly knew what kind of anime it was going to be. Not a refined anime with a captivating story, no. I just wanted to watch an diverting/childish anime and FT suited perfectly for me.\r\nStory : 4/10\r\nThe true good point of the story is that it takes place very quickly. You don'thave to wait 40 episodes for it to begin. Even if it can be considerated as disregarded, most of people dont have the time/patience to wait that much and it makes them leave the show. The background is basic (magic, guilds, mages, ...) but still cool. The first episodes were really good since they described the guild and its crazy atmosphere very well. The plot really depends on the arc you are watching... Yes, there is a lot of \"clich\u00e9s\" in FT but, in my opinion, it's not important since it's a shounen... \\n\r\nI also appreciated the fact to not see them practice over and over again... It trends to be boring and not interesting sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 6/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite its poor story, Fairy Tail has nice characters. Even if they are all similar because that is Fairy Tail, they all love each other, blablabla... They still have their own personality/role in the anime. I'll just define the main group characters as members of a body.\\n\r\nLucy \"the brain\" : Maybe I defined this way because she is the only one to use her brain in the anime but she always magages to find a solution which is not \"smash smash smash\". I know a lot of people will be like : \" WAIT WAT LUCY HAS A BRAIN AND NOT ONLY BOOBS?LOL\" but no, she figured out a lot of problems despite the fact that yes, she gets undressed a lot (most of the time because of the group is asking her to...).\\n\r\nNatsu \"the arms/fists\" : just because of his \"burning\" personality. He is rushing the fight everytime. And God, that's funny to see him get wrecked by a villain. Yes, he mostly wins his battles by getting powered up but... Is it not the case in 95% for this kind of animes ?\\n\r\nErza \"the body\" : her power (she is feared by almost all the others) and appearance (strong charismatic woman) will always bring the group together to face their problem. She is also the \"shield\" for the group/guild.\\n\r\nGrey \"the legs\" : my regret in this show... Grey is nothing but an alternative Natsu / a support in the group. First time I saw him, I was like \"oh god it's a Vegeta-like\" but no, they didnt managed to develop him correctly to make him badass as hell (but Luxus is here to catch this up I guess).\\n\r\nWendy \"the heart\" : a sweet little girl who always cares for the others / wants to help them the best she can with her healing magic. She is also the only character that trully evolves in the anime (growing up, getting stronger, getting her own battles, etc...).\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters have a decent story even if we all regret that some of them don't get more attention from the author. The perfect example is Lisanna. She came back from the dead (or sort of) and she still remains unexploited ! She had a \"something\" with Natsu but it seems it is over... There is no more interactions between those two... That's too bad ! \\n\r\nThere is almost no characters dying in FT and it's fine for me ! I would still be so sad if a secondary character like Mira or Reby died :/ and it's just the case in FT I don't know why...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe animations in the different battles are very good ! It's the same all along the anime but I don't get bored. The chara design is good too. Some people blame the show for his fanservice or more precisly, the fact that all the female characters have a big breast, you have to consider that it's completly normal in FT world... (judging by Levy, Wendy and Mavis reactions when they are talking about that lol). \\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nWow ! In my opinion, FT has the BEST OST among the anime world ! I never feeled like that with a soundtrack before. Battles OST are intense, sad moments OST are touching. I can't tell more. But it depends on you I guess... For my part, when I'm watching an anime, I am completly immersed into the anime's world and, because of this, the OST is very important to \"live\" these moments.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy to watch Fairy Tail because it's very entertaining. It does not have a fantastic plot as others animes but it does have sweet characters and a proper atmosphere and I don't expect more from FT when I'm watching it. Fanservice gags make me laugh more than they disturb me (some people feel uncomfortable with it) and I don't consider them as annoying because it's a part of the FT's charm. Also, FT is one of the only animes which can make me laugh during a critical moment, forcing me to release all the pressure I accumulated (as I previously said, I really live through the anime when I'm watching it haha).\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nPros :\\n\\n\r\n- Very entertaining.\\n\r\n- BEST OST EVER.\\n\r\n- Cool battles / animations / powers.\\n\r\n- Characters are sweet and you learn to like them but...\\n\r\n- Story/plot/arcs are cool but...\\n\\n\r\nCons :\\n\\n\r\n- ... not pushed hard enough. It could have been much more interesting.\\n\r\n- Villains are not that bad ass / captivating (except for Zeref).\\n\r\n- 90% of fillers are really bad.\\n\r\n- [troll mode : on] Don't look the Eclipse Celestial Spirits arc ! [/troll mode : off] :P",

            "content": "Fairy Tail... Where do I begin? First, I just want to tell you not to be thrown off by the scores. After all, I did decide to watch this anime even though one of the reviews gave it a 5...! \r\nThe thing I liked most about this anime was the Music. The beginning OST, and ending OST's  were beautiful, and they were by far some of the best! With that said... The second thing I liked about this anime was that the fighting scenes weren't very long. Most lasted about 2 episodes maybe 3, and the very Important ones were maybe 4. If you'rethinking that's a lot... Go watch One Piece, those battles are SUPER long, although I was okay with it because it was interesting. It's all a matter of preference, but I felt that the short battles worked for Fairy Tail. That's the other thing I like about this anime. It doesn't really drag things around. It just cuts right to the chase, which again works out wonderfully for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs every anime has pros, every anime must also have cons... The thing I disliked THE most is originality... The writers/producers had no originality in the battle system whatsoever. By this I mean, that every fighting scene could be summed up easily. The \"hero\" lays the smack down on the boss, the boss \"powers\" up, and then beats up the hero. The \"hero\" talks about not letting his friends down, and then somehow gathers enough power to defeat the boss...! Almost every battle scene is like this. After a while it gets annoying, but it's something you can bear... At least for now. Another thing I didn't really like is character progression. I saw none of that, and it really upsetted me! For 175 episodes the characters BARELY progress! By progress I mean emotionally, skillfully, etc. Their's NO character progression at all, but as the Manga is not complete yet,  maybe we'll see some character progression later on...\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a solid 6. While Music, and simplicity were great about this anime, what really hurt it was tthe fact that It was a little TOO simple, which led to little originality and that led to no character progression. I do urge you to try it, as it does have its good moments! Thank  you, and I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.",

            "content": "Before I start, I will state that I have a biased opinion towards Fairy Tail because I absolutely enjoy the manga. \r\nStory: The anime is really following the manga's storyline so that is a good, but also a bad thing. Due to it following the manga, the anime may get kind of dull at times like Lucy's part and some episodes, but overall the anime is pretty fast paced (which I like). The beginning starts off well, then it fills 4 episodes worth of character introduction so don't be turned off by them. Since Fairy Tail is a guild of course there are many charactersso they want you to know each (that are important). In episode 5, the story starts picking up again and I'm hoping for some action like in the manga. Like I stated earlier, I read the manga thus I have a brief idea what's going to happen next and I anticipate for it as opposed to others who don't.\\n\\n\r\nThe art: Looks like One Piece. Nothing else I can say well besides for the wizardry fire parts Natsu performs with his fists and the dragon flying out that was kind of corny, but w/e I LOVE NATSU so I forgive.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I am absolutely disappointed by Natsu's and Grey's voice actors. I expected something more energetic from them, but instead I got some dull voices. The opening is a typical shounen opening nothing very memorable about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I have high hopes for this anime, but was horridly disappointed, but it's okay I have yet to lose hope because the juicy parts of the start has yet to start so guys just pull through! If you can watch Naruto's training arcs you can definitely watch Fairy Tail! :] \\n\\n",

            "content": "Okay so Fairy Tail recently ended so I thought I might as well write a review about this shounen anime... Like any shounen anime, there is always one who is meant to be the strongest of them all... Like Bleach being Kurosaki and Naruto being \"Naruto\" and Fairy Tail being Natsu... And there are other supporting characters that grow strong with these strong protagonists such as Lucy, Erza, Gray and the other characters... Fairy Tail is at times hilarious and the art is, in my eyes, good, being a very popular anime, the art is heavily focused. However, there are many pin points in FairyTail which are not being focused on when they are supposed to be...\\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nStory: The story is very generic and simplistic like any other shounen anime. It is overrated in a sense that many people exaggerate too much about this anime... From my perspective, the story is very mediocre, the story arcs are very short and does not develop much tension and feels to the stories. I am not trying to say the arcs should be about 100 episodes long but Fairy Tail goes in this sequence:\"Heres an enemy, defeats him, the team gets stronger, we win\" A heavily repetitive sequence in Fairy Tail...\\n\\n\r\nArt: Nothing to comment of... The scenes shown in Fairy Tail has been adapted from the manga very well...\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtracks of Fairy Tail is okay but does not make the audience feel as much tension as it is needed...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The major flaw in Fairy Tail is the character and their development... Like shounen animes, for example Katekyo Hitman Reborn, it is shown clearly that the protagonist and the supporting characters are getting \"stronger\" in a way that their attacks and skills looks improved and have much more impact... However, in Fairy Tail, this is not applied... Fairy Tail has shown Natsu look too strong with its first appearance that all its fights look boring and simple with all his attacks being small fire breaths and fire punches and kicks... And according to Erza, Natsu is getting stronger but all they apply to him is more scales or darker face appearance...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Comedy, one of the very important aspect of Shounen anime, as most of its audiences are young children... To appeal to these children, comedy is a must which obviously Fairy Tail has, but its comedy is no different to that of other shounen animes... It's good but it's a very generic comedy which most anime also has... \\n\\n\r\n*NOTE: This is a review of my own... Views may differ as not all people have the same opinions*",

            "content": "(updated 9/19/18 for format and slight content revision)\r\nHi! Welcome to another Robert's Too Late Review! First of all, I am reviewing the 'dubbed' version of the show, and this is of course preliminary because I have not seen all 227 bajillion episodes of the show. There's a lot to address in this show, but if you come at it with open eyes, that it is very much similar to American 'popcorn blockbuster' movies, then you might well be fairly entertained. If you come looking for depth and complexity, not so much. Mindset and expectations play a great deal into whether this is silly or sillyand fun for a viewer. Of course we will also answer the burning question of whether or not Erza and crew made the RTLR wall of insanity!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7 *SPOILERS somewhat present in this section*\\n\r\nThe story seems to be a very recycled version of: find bad guy, fight bad guy, lose, get incredibly angry and gain new powers, beat the tar out of bad guy, profit? This is rehashed several times throughout the series in different arcs. The writers try to keep it somewhat fresh with new powers, and kind of exotic characters (there's what appears to be a member of KISS in one arc, seriously) but it still is repetitive. Sometimes we gain glances into character's pasts, such as Lucy actually being rich, Erza being a former child slave, but those take a backseat to meet bad guy, beat up bad guy. Not always a bad thing, just don't expect Citizen Kane here. The story is just there to facilitate showing new bad guys, and showing ever increasing levels of powers from the heroes. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nI love the animation and detail in the visuals. The magic crests are impressive, and the effects are often cool in and of themselves. I am a Lucy fan, but Erza's many magical armors and weapons are all really pretty darn cool. The characters all have traits that make them recognizable, which is not bad work when there's so many different characters, such as the drunk gal who never wears anything but a bikini top, or the old dude whose hair looks like a throwing star. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe effects are cool, explosions sound pretty like they look. One problem to note, and this is likely related to where and how I view the anime, but there are in my version, some inconsistencies in volume. Natsu's opening 'don't sit too close to the tv' speech is quite muted, dialog is at a normal level, but the theme songs and episode titles are harshly loud. Like I said, probably related to my particular method of viewing. Otherwise the dubbed voices are spot on. Happy can be annoying, but I adore Lucy and Erza's voices, Natsu sounds appropriately empty headed, and Grey sounds like a tough guy. The English dub also features *both* of my favorite voice talents, Jamie Marchi as (admittedly support character) Cana, and Brittney Karbowsky as Wendy Marvell. Works for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7 \\n\r\nI rate the characters lower because they are fairly static, and seem to develop extra powers that only pertain to that particular battle/episode/arc. This isn't necessarily an indictment as I said, going in knowing it's a 'popcorn' anime, I knew we weren't getting hours and hours devoted to developing characters. They develop them just enough to lead to the next set piece or the next huge fight. Secrets are revealed for motivation to fight and basically just forgotten. Lucy is the cute blonde who summons weird spirit creatures who of course runs into situations where she can't summon. Erza is a magic knight that learns here and there to forgo her armor. Grey is the resident ice mage and is jealous of Natsu, the fire dragonslayer and Natsu himself is like so many other heroes, an ultra super powered idiot. They all just serve to bring the noise, which is acceptable if nearly mindless 'cool battles bro' is what you're going for, which as I say, isn't always a bad thing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI watch this show with my 15 year old niece, and we love cheering our favorites on. She can't wait to see Grey bust out his ice powers, and I'm rooting for Lucy or Erza to kick some bad guy tail. Our enjoyment comes from the fact we don't have to keep up with the storyline so much. The bad guys are basically clearly marked, as are the good guys, so we just want to see some great action sequences. And in that capacity, Fairy Tail does NOT let us down. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, come into this anime to just watch without thinking. Laugh as Natsu and Grey stop fighting the bad guy to battle each other. Or when Erza bonks them both on the head and gets them back on track. Groan every time Lucy's summons does/says their catchprhase. As for the wall, Erza and Lucy both make the cut, representing the Fairy Tail crew.  Watch for cool fights, stupidly over the top plots to set up those fights, and live happy the rest of your life!",

            "content": "So one day a mangaka that has never been seen without sunglasses decided to take his previous creation, Rave, and hardcore it up a notch, while correcting most of his previous mistakes, and also adding plenty of our western mythology instead of the crappy asian one. So in the end we get an anime set in the typical fantasy/medieval world, where magic rules everything, evil warlocks are on the rise and wizards (with practically zero actual physical strength) form guilds and fight for loot and glory. One of those guilds, Fairy Tail, is famous for its specialty, which is destruction and is the guild youngLucy Heartfilia wants to join. Welcome to a world of  action, romance, comedy, wizards, demons, undead, dragons and all sorts of monsters in a medieval fantasy (kinda) setting!\\n\\n\r\nWhere Fairy Tail truly shines is getting you to sympathise with its characters. Do keep in mind that Fairy Tail's PROTAGONIST is Lucy, the female lead, and not Natsu, the male lead. From start to finish it is Lucy's thoughts we hear as the narration and not Natsu's. We also see things from Lucy's perspective. In other words despite Natsu being a powerhouse, the view of the world we get is from a 17 year old very vulnerable girl, for whom we naturally feel more sorry  when she gets her a$$ kicked (aka every episode). Do keep in mind that no Shounen has ever had a female protagonist before (even if all the main beating is still handled by the male lead). Naturally other characters attract our attention equally (ok not equally, more like 50% of the feels we get for Lucy), who all must make sacrifices, have tough decisions to think over etc etc. \\n\\n\r\nSay Sakura was in danger. Are we afraid? No, because she's a woman, we already know she's not going to get hurt. Chichi? The same. Nami? Well duh... Rukia? ... Ok she might actually get hurt but she's no female, she's just a male who happens to be more focused on agility than raw strength, Kubo needs to work on that a bit. But when it is Lucy that's about to be hurt (and believe me, that's the rule rather than the exception) we're all hanging from the edge of our sits (specifically I'm hanging from the edge of my 380 dollar leather revolving armchair while you're hanging from your IKEA furniture that your mom bought for your birthday). And since the women in Fairy Tail are in fact subjects to their mortality we actually are worried and feel for them. \\n\\n\r\nAnd here's another shining moment of Fairy Tail: Constant danger. When Mashima got our awesome mythology he got the whole package, including warlocks, necromancers, dragons, demons and all sorts of other monstrosities. Ignoring how plain AWESOME having these things animated properly is, the villains also usually display the cruelty and ruthlessness you would expect of them, and despite almost everyone having a final goal, you will soon notice that most are in it for the kicks, or are just plain sadists. This is especially true when it comes to women, who usually display the most cruelty (specifically when beating the crap out of Lucy) and to be honest, I'm perfectly ok with that. With the whole plot revolving around wizards known as \"Dragonslayers\" and the creations of the ancient necromancer/warlock Zeref, you can expect some epic fantasy situations to start hitting the fan almost from the start. Oh and before I forget:\\n\\n\r\n-Dear Asia, I want you to describe what dragons are like.\\n\\n\r\n-They are wise ancient serpents with no wings that symbolise the power of nature, the inner peace of water and the harmonic balance of the universe while their mustaches just add to their natural wisdom.\\n\\n\r\n-Good Asia, now I want you to tell me what you see Fairy Tail doing.\\n\\n\r\n-W-W-Wild r-r-rampaging...\\n\\n\r\n-WILD RAMPAGING BEASTS THAT WANT TO STOMP, BURN AND EAT US ALL, BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE MOTHERF$%^ING DRAGONS! And f$%\" your g@! a$$ mustaches! \\n\\n\r\n\"Cough\" Lets just leave it at \"ep 192 was freaking awesome.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd since soundtrack is the Alpha and the Omega in my book, naturally I can't help but say Fairy Tail gets 10/10. With a wide variety that starts from tear-jerking dramatic tracks (usually when something horrible scars Lucy for life) to the techno-beats that play during battles, Fairy Tail knows has an awesome soundtrack that it uses almost perfectly (ok not Bleach levels, but still...). Listening to \"Black Wizard's Wicked Heart\" and others is one of my favourite ways to get hyped when playing dota or making games (that and drinking Monster Absolute Zero). The voice acting follows right away with the voice actors not-about-to-die \"cough, One Piece, cough\", and for the most part fitting perfectly. The openings are almost all amazing, with many of the endings deserving applause (especially ending 18: \"Don't let me down\" and the one right after that, \"Chasing\" were both 10/10). The visuals naturally follow through, with the style slightly reminding of One Piece only better.\\n\\n\r\nWell, not much to say about it, by far one of the best settings in shounens, amazing soundtrack that gets you hooked up, plenty of things you've against in MMOs in all their deadly glory and touches of romance every now and then to spice things up. Definitely worth its time.",

            "content": "Now let me preference this by saying that I have only seen 8 episodes of Fairy Tail so far, so for all I know the show could get much better. Just look at this as first impressions for the show. Maybe in about a couple of months I might give Fairy Tail another try. Now with that said Fairy Tail is one of the most generic shonen anime I have ever watched.\r\nDuring the time of this review there is the BIG 3 in anime. They are shonen jump titles that have a large following not only in Japan but also in America; they are Bleach,One Piece and Naruto. As Bleach comes to its end and Naruto begins to slow on the breaks many shonen shows will try to take their place in the BIG 3. There is Hunter X Hunter (which I have never seen), Blue Exorcist (still, never seen), and Hajime no Ippo (you might notice a pattern now...) but the one show that has pretty much taken the spot of Bleach is Fairy Tail.\\n\\n\r\nSo about a year ago I got into anime. I had always liked anime shows but never truly knew that they were anime. The shows I loved were Dragonball Z, One Piece and even Naruto. I still somewhat enjoy these shows today (okay maybe only One Piece) but because of this I figured walking into Fairy Tail would be a nice fun piece of cake. So one day I searched Fairy Tail on YouTube and Funimation had about 40 episodes up so I decided to watch 10 episodes to give the show a try. I then began to watch the first episode\u2026..\\n\\n\r\nNow I remember asking myself multiple questions after the first episode. Like, were the main characters introduced at all interesting? I mean Lucy is a walking piece of cardboard pretty much with Natsu there to give the best Monkey D. Luffy impression he can do (seriously, no else notices how much he acts, talks and eats like Luffy?). Lucy has nothing going for her except tits but besides that all the female characters have this problem. In the big world of shonen anime males rule so Fairy Tail tries it's best to make Natsu and Grey look as cool as possible. There is also Erza but she is fan service that just happens to be strong. Also even though all the characters can use magic how come they only use one type of magic? I mean if you could use breath fire and summon other worldly beings you would be well off but learning other magic would not hurt right?\\n\\n\r\nThe story seems to so far have the problem that Bleach had and that most bad shonen have and that is that there is no real long-term goal to achieve. With One Piece it is for Luffy to become King of the Pirates and for Naruto it is for Naruto to become head of the village. So far in Fairy Tail it is threat comes up and the group solves it. How can an over 130+ anime episode show have an overall plot this paper thin? It also has a major problem that I had with Naruto. In the first episode of Naruto, the title character becomes a ninja. The problem with this was that there was no internal struggle to become a ninja. Same with Lucy in Fairy Tail, she wants to become part of Fairy Tail and boom, first episode alone she joins. In doing this we don\u2019t see how much the characters truly want to follow their dreams because they are practically handed them in the first episode alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe show looked nice but nothing really caught my eyes, with characters looking good with nice looking scenery. The fights looked cool I guess but overall One Piece came out years earlier and looked much better than Fairy Tail. The opening for the first season was okay with no great animation with a generic as hell song to boot, but I enjoyed the ending only because I am a sucker for a catchy electronic tune. The overall music for the show I did not pay very much attention to, since it was just the same melody every time a fight began.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the eight episodes I frankly had no interest in watching anymore of the anime. I just started watching Baccano! And never went back. I know that the show has a large following and I don\u2019t want to offend any of its fans but come on guys! This is popular enough to be part of the BIG 3? A five year-old could have written the show! Recently though many fans of the show have been complaining of the repetitive nature of Fairy Tail so change could happen I doubt it. I would not tell anyone that considers themselves mature anime watchers to consider Fairy Tail, but for younger viewers getting into anime I guess it's an okay starting point.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL RATING: Mediocre- Fairy Tail brings nothing new to the table, but fans of shonen might like the bland but like-able characters.\\n",

            "content": "Do you want to see an anime with the worst fillers since Naruto? Do you love characters with so much plot armor that they survive everything? Is an anime with overpowered fire breathing mages, driven by nakamapower your thing? Are you a fan of a heroine whose most significant characteristic is... her boobs (literally, she's useless). This overpraised battle-shounen has been made for you.\r\n~Story~ 3/10\r\nThis anime has nothing that's original, nothing. It seems to be a combination of One Piece (nakamapower), Naruto (stupid fillers), Highschool DxD (boobs) and a little bit of Mars of Destruction (the awesome and original characters). Our story starts with LucyHeartfilia, who's some weird kind of Pokemon master (with big boobs like we already mentioned). She's not strong. Or smart. Or anything at all. But what she can do, is pretending to be pretty while being saved by her friends. She then meets Natsu, our favorite fire breathing plot-armored motion-sickened retard (seriously, does this guy even have a brain?). He's an annoying combination of Luffy and Naruto. He has one new aspect: motion sickness. He gets a lot of random power-ups because of... well, plot convenience. Natsu is a member of Fairy Tail, a magic guild which only causes trouble, but which hasn't been suspended by the council yet, for some reason (the council is totally useless in this anime anyway). He takes Lucy to Fairy Tail, and she joins their guild. They then embark on a journey to find... Natsu's father. Who's a dragon. (Yes we know, this anime doesn't know logic and it clearly doesn't know the story of the birds and bees either, deal with it) They get into trouble several times, and in each of these a sad past of a Fairy Tail member is revealed. Because if you don't have a sad backstory, you can't join Fairy Tail. Watch our characters take on a much stronger opponent every arc, but still defeating them after a nakama speech. Also, watch some really interesting villains turn good after a battle (seriously, we could give you a ton of examples of this in this anime). And then comes our main villain... Zeref. And watch him... whine? Why is he even here? He doesn't serve any purpose, right? I thought they were looking for dragons? Do they find the dragons? Will Zeref ever stop whining? Watch this anime to find out. Oh wait. You won't find out. Maybe in the sequel, bitch. For real though, the premise of this seems promising. The first arcs were actually okay and the world building was fine, but they decided to use the same formula over and over and OVER again. The pacing was pretty bad at some points too. If the magic had been more interesting and was explained more, it could have been a lot more enjoyable. But after some time, the story just wasn't interesting anymore. It was repetitive, and the characters made no progression in achieving their main goal at all.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe story was weak, and full of nakama power. Just what we needed. It was also repetitive after the fifth arc or so. This anime is so popular, and the fanbase is so large, but why? There are way better shone anime out there, this anime is average at best. The premise was interesting, but everything turned into a mess with our heroes defeating the \"extremely powerful\" villains over and over and over again... very entertaining, especially after the tenth time.\\n\\n\r\n~Art~ 7/10\\n\r\nThe art of this show is pretty good. It looks like a magical shounen anime's animation. Exactly what it is. The animation changed over the years, the animation of the first episodes is really different from the animation of the last episodes. Especially the character designs of the women, their boobs grew every 10 episodes or so. Great job creators, is this show aimed at horny teens or something? The animation is colorful, and let's be honest, the battles look pretty awesome now and then. The animation isn't very special, it's quite generic, but not ugly.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe animation is plain but it serves its purpose.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~ 7/10\\n\r\nFairy, where are you going... Yeah. Most of the openings in this anime were pretty decent (and catchy too). They were a bit too happy to our liking though. But you shouldn't rely on our opinion too much, taste in music is very subjective after all. The OST's in this anime were actually good.  They matched the scenes and they were easily recognizable as Fairy Tail OST's. The endings were okay too, though nothing special.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe music in this show was pretty decent. The best aspect of this show in our opinion.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~ 2/10\\n\r\nThis cast is so original. Nope. We have an overpowered, nakama motivated, plot-armored hero and he has a cute animal as a sidekick. The main heroine is weaker than the main hero (again: so original), she also has big boobs (this is like the 847394th time we're saying this) and she is constantly saved by everyone. She also gets a lot of random power-ups, because this is a generic magic battle shounen. We also have Gray, Natsu's rival... VERY original. Oh, and before we forget: he likes stripping, because man service is exactly what this show lacked. Yes, this cast sucks. But then there's our savior Erza. Oh wait, no. She's a tsundere who always fights with the main characters. But then she also has a sweet side and has a weird obsession for cake. And last but not least, a cute loli, who is totally useless: Wendy. She has one of the most annoying sidekicks ever: Charles. There are a few interesting characters (hence the 2/10), e.g.: Mirajane, Gajeel and Laxus. But they didn't get a lot of screen time, and the rest of the characters were just generic and boring.\\n\r\nAnd may I have your attention for... the worst cast of villains ever created! Our first serious villain turns out to be Gray's adopted brother and... turns good. Our second villain didn't turn good, but his henchmen did. Welcome to Fairy Tail, Gajeel and Juvia. Our third villain actually kills someone... and turns good after that. And the guy we're talking about REFUSES to die, because he just keeps appearing. Another villain, Laxus... also turned good. It's not even funny anymore. Oh, yeah, we almost forgot about the main villain: Zeref. Who's a whiny retard that does absolutely nothing in these 175 episodes. Worst villains ever.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nHahaha. This cast is so bland and boring. We didn't care at all about these generic characters. And the villains are on a whole new level of stupidity; everyone turns good (or in a love interest). This cast is really bad, the only characters that were well-developed were Mirajane and Elfman (the problems with getting over a certain traumatic experience), but this show is called Fairy Tail, so the makers decided to bring a certain person back. Good job!\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~ 5/10\\n\r\nEspecially during the first arcs, this show was quite enjoyable. The story was neither deep nor really interesting, but the jokes were funny, and over-all it just was something light to watch. But when the story progressed, it got so repetitive. A simple repetitive story + horrible characterization = Fairy Fail. (Sorry, I couldn't contain myself) However, we do disagree with those who scored this show a 1/10, because that's not fair. This show definitely isn't good, but it's not a 1/10 when it's below average. It has some promising concepts and the animation and music were decent. It's just that it could have been so much more. However, we disagree with both the diehard fans and the diehard haters.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThis could have been good, if it didn't get so repetitive. But it is what it is: an under-average boring magical battle shounen. If you love this genre, or dislike good anime, then you might like this show, but if you prefer something with decent characters and a good story, then watch something else (some personal recommendations: Fullmetal Alchemist, HunterxHunter, Gintama). So please know that you'll be wasting your time if your expectations of this show are high. It's your own time, so we can't tell you what to do, but we recommend you to not watch this anime filled with boobs, nakama motives and blue flying cats. Peace.",

            "content": "I know Fairy Tail isn't over, and that it is coming back on April of this year but I really wanted more than a review, to share my taughts about this show.\r\nFairy Tail is about Lucy, a 17 year old mage, who wants to join a famous mages guild called ''Fairy Tail'' While visiting a town, she meets a pink-haired boy named Natsu and his cat, called Happy. It turns out that this boy is member of this guild, and he helps Lucy join.\r\nCharacters: For me this is one of the strong points in Fairy Tail. There is big variety of unique characters, some loveable,and some not so much, and a great character development of moslty the main characters (Lucy, Natsu, Gray, Erza and Wendy) and some others throught the series. There are various cases in which characters that were enemies of Fairy Tail, became allies, which happened lots of times, and it has become quite repetitive. Regardless, there is a big amount of characters, which makes the anime interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack of this anime is  impressive and unique. Most of them, such as the main theme, are of celtic style which is original and outstanding. I think the Fairy Tail Sountracks fit really good with the anime, which makes it more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nStory: The center of this anime is magic. It is used in a different way that we are used to in movies such as Harry Potter, in which they used wands but in this anime they use a sistem called  ''Magic Circles''. I really liked seeing all the different styles of magic that exist in that world, and how they used it, it was very cool and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n This story has 175 episodes, in which you experience various arcs. We have some arcs for the main characters, which I think that is very positive to get to known them better, and other ones which moslty contain all the guild fighting against an enemy. Regardless the action in the arcs, and the enemies, I think it was fine. I really dislike the ''Nakama Power-Up'' This anime has. What i mean with this, is that in ALL the fights, the character gain forces by thinking about their friends. I think that is better if they gained force by anger, or other more realistic feeling. In this anime one of the most important messages is the family. I think it is good, but it's bad to use that power in all the arcs. It becomes boring and repetitve.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights in this anime are good, they have as backround music an awsome fight soundtrack, and some epic scenes. BUT they never lose. They win all the fights which i find very disturbing. Some times is good to see them lose, so they can develop better, and become stronger using that motivation, but as i said that motivation is the family and friends. (They lose at the last arc, but some fights only). Anyways, the enemies of this show are awsome, and most of them have a back story, which helps us to understand them more, and to get to know them better (Which is excellent for me)\\n\\n\r\nArt: I really like the art of this anime, but there are two things that disturb me a LOT. One: The lack of blood in the fights. This anime doesn't contain blood. Which makes the fights more unrealistic. Two: Fanservice. Lately, on the OVA5 and in the last arc, there is a LOT of fanservice. Which is sad because it takes a little bit of the enjoyment of the show. There has always been a little bit of it, but it has become annyoing, specially in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nTaking aside or the bad things about this anime, it is really good. It makes you laugh, you fall in love with a lot of this characters, you may feel bad for some of them, or happy, etc. Im looking foward to see when it comes back, and maybe the bad things about it are corrected. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: 8\\n",

            "content": "I can\u2019t believe i watched the whole thing since is incredible boring and predictable, I only think of \u201cOverrated\u201d to described this anime in a short way. I only watched it  since wouldn\u00b4t be fair to  said that was terrible by episode 80. \r\nFairy tail has this formula:\r\n- Appears bad guys which are \u201c\u201dinvincible\u201d\u201d (yeah sure) \r\n- Bad guys beat all fairy tail members super-fast \r\n- they remember something from the past or someone kidnap/ torture lucy and then natsu power up ,  MC becomes now invincible ( because friendship) and  beats the seriously bad dudes that are way OP forthem and shouldn't be able to beat. \\n\r\n- Celebration and going home\\n\r\n-Repeat.\\n\\n\r\nFight scenes are really static, always show someone talking or being surprise of how amazing is the fight instead of showing a fluid scene. \\n\\n\r\nAt the begging was a good anime with a lot of potential but nothing really happens, story is the same just that with different evil people.  Main characters never develops, they are so plain and predictable, all clich\u00e9 .  Natsu is so annoying, I mean the guy never thinks of anything just go and try to punch OP bad guys without any plan at all, and he doesn\u00b4t talk, he yells.  \\n\r\nLucy who was my favorite character instead of becoming a great magician she became the Boobs of the show, they reduce her into the main source of ecchi and also the \u201ckidnapped princess\u201d who is so useless that every single person of the show has more power that her, ever the celestial beings were stronger when they had different owners but once lucy have  them they never work, they leave the fights cuz they have to go to dates or simple because she \u201cgive them the day off\u201d, is always an excuse to make her look like a hopeless princess who needs help. I wont forgt the unnecessary over dramatic torture in the \u201cmagic games\u201d I mean loki doesn\u2019t show up always he sense lucy is on danger? Nooo, they have to torture her so natsu can be upset and be the hero.\\n\\n\r\nthe worst part is the only time they were about t training they went to a party instead, but don\u2019t worry here is a magical fast solution as always on this serie, ultear appears and give the possibility of more magic capability, and at the same time she explain that even that they ran out of magic they will absorbed it from the air , omg !  ther are so many incongruences in the plot that is so DIFFICULT to ignore, the arcs are so short that basically they always win because they find out a super fast magical way in the last minute. This show is basically for kids but with a huge amount of Ecchi that is hard to believe that the demographic  audience are kids in fact.\\n\\n\r\nI think of fairy tail an insult of adventure shonen. The fighting scenes are so tedious, they don\u2019t plan anything, they only power up. I recommend this to kids. if you are looking for a good story, character development, plot twist this is not your anime.  If you are looking for hot dudes or woman half naked who have powers with a really simple story you will like it. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10 \\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nEnglish is not my native language, sorry for bad grammar. \\n",

            "content": "Fairy Tail is an anime with nothing special or groundbreaking. If a character is in a dangerous situation, power-ups come to their rescue. If they want to give a motivational speech and get even stronger, they talk about the power of friendship and save the world. Their plot armor is so thick no god can kill them. This is a sin shared by many anime, but Fairy Tail overdid it.\r\nThe anime successfully creates its own world, introduces characters with different abilities. One Piece has pirates and devil fruits, Bleach has Soul Society and bankai, Naruto has ninja villages, and Fairy Tail offers a guild system.Guild members work shoulder to shoulder trying to save humanity once again. Where the anime fails is the execution. \\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail\u2019s biggest sin is power creep. Characters continuously power up, beat their foes, save the day, hot girls with boobs of the size of the moon fall for them. Any difference between characters in terms of power is sacrificed for plot convenience. In HunterxHunter, for example, we at least know the limits of characters. We know that even main characters cannot mess with certain enemies. But in Fairy Tail nothing is impossible for the main character. The reason? One of the characters says about Natsu, the protagonist: \u201cNatsu-san gets more powerful when facing strong foes.\u201d This means that there\u2019s no point of enemies and other characters. Natsu just needs to face the enemy in order to defeat them. There is no point to the story.\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail tries to compensate for its shortcomings with endless fan service. Big silicon-filled boobs embellish every scene. This is the most fan service filled shounen out there. Unlike One Piece where female characters miraculously grow fatty glands in later episodes, in Fairy Tail they are there from the very start. We are showered with lots of skin. Lots of buttock shots, lots of sexy women. The anime treats its fans like testosterone factories. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with the anime is that it has a lot of pretty-face characters that don\u2019t contribute to the story. After watching all 175 episodes, I still don\u2019t get why most of the guild members are there. Go and kill half of them, the story will lose nothing. Go kill the remaining half and the anime will improve. \\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail does everything in the book, throws every gimmick in the book at your face. It fails at most of them. It ends up as a caricature of itself, with lots of wasted opportunities. Plus, it has 35 filler episodes. In other words, one episode in every five doesn\u2019t contribute to the story in any meaningful way. \\n",

But the light heartness of this show, the interesting plot points that we discover and the great fights. Fairy tail is a fun show, it's fun to watch it, it's fun to talk about it. People take this show very seriously and I think this is the problem.\r\nWhile the main character, nasu, is you mightsay the \"averge shounen hero\" doesn't mean that he is a bad character. He hold high values of his friends and he cares a lot about people close to him. He is a great guy that you can't really dislike. He has his own moments that make him different for other shounen MC. We also have charaters like erza, who will show the people that \"girls aren't only fit for kitchen\". As a guy who saw a lot of anime where the girls treated as weak and fragile, this is a refreshing female character!\\n\\n\r\nThe fights are simply amazing. There is lots and lots of powers who will keep your head glued to the screen. Even if the outcome is most of the time predictable, you still can enjoy the fights very much.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the animation is not very good, the art is amazing. The character design of hiro mashima is absoulute beautiful, and let's not forgot the amazing soundtruck, I believe everyone can agree that the music in fairy tail is very good.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that people should just relax, sit back and enjoy this anime. Because once you really start to just enjoy and stop looking at the bad side-you will discover a great anime.",

            "content": "Ive been reading the manga around since chapter 8, and i must say, fairy tail is the 2nd anime that i watched since my 2 and half year break from anime. (besides watching gundam 00 s2 and code geass r2 when it airs)\r\nso far, till ep 11.\r\nMy list of criticism: \r\nSound:\r\n- i must say, it is a disappointment to me that natsu's seiyuu is one of those who seems to have a serious tone as from my experience of reading the manga, natsu is more of a character like one piece's luffy and should therefore have a seiyuu with a lack of serious tone majorityof the time like luffy's. \\n\\n\r\n- in the first ep, when hearing happy's voice, i was totally disappointed. the aye sounds so lame here..... its too high piched however, after 5 eps or so you get used to it.... so i guess its okay\\n\\n\r\n- lucy's voice is okay but not the best\\n\\n\r\n- erza and gray voice = good choices\\n\\n\r\n- The background music is, i must say, rather unfitting many times. it seems like they just put in some chorus out from nowhere when there's a battle scene, not to mention that the chorus didn't do a good job -- it didn't fit\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n- The art, i must say, is rather disappointing too. I have absolutely no idea why the heck they create those magic circles everytime the characters casts magic. And on top of that, the action scenes is a big disappointment -- Fairy Tail is obvious a action themed story, however, there is too much talking and too less action when there's suppose to be action and when there is action, it feels like im watching barely moving CG's.\\n\\n\r\n- Why the hell theres a dragon that appear whenever natsu use any move?!\\n\\n\r\n- As a major fan of Erza, i am disappointed by how her character design changed so much in the anime. When one compares her design from the anime with the manga, one can cleary see that her hairstyle and eyes design changed a lot! It seems like shes a totally different person -- it is too lively, shes more of a serious type. And her adult like beauty is lost... Also, her hair color is too bright crimson. It is suppose to be dark crimson....\\n\\n\r\n- I am disappointed with Gerard's hair color. It is too bright! his hair color is obviously dark blue with some tones of sky blue. However, instead it became totally sky blue. \\n\\n\r\n- The fairy tail guild tattoo being completely colorful is annoying me. In the manga, it is mostly shown as fully black in the color pages, and i must say, that's better than being so colorful.\\n\\n\r\n- i was disappointed with the scene where natsu and happy thanked lucy for the food. It seems to that the scene in the manga is actually more funny...\\n\\n\r\n- seems to me that they tried to add in the facial effects from the manga --- those totally wtf faces (with big black eyes and etc...) however, this is not a manga and they pretty much failed with it. I mean heck, they just put that in for 2 seconds and thats it.... not funny... unlike the manga... they did a bad job on that...\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n- This is another typical shounen type good vs. bad story. It is not as good as one piece, but the story is faster paced than one piece, which is slow as hell. However, Fairy Tail is obviously better than Bleach and Naruto. Also, it is a disappointment that Hiro Mashima's previous manga made anime Rave Master sucked. I hope fairy tail don't end up like that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nspoiler:\\n\\n\r\ni have no fckin idea where in the manga did erza became known as \"the knight\".... it sounds so lame, i mean, her nickname erza the titania sounds way better",

            "content": "This show is old so what can I really say about Fairy Tail that other people have not? Probably nothing much, so I will instead briefly discuss why I dropped it.\r\nI enjoyed this show quite a bit but please do not think that this is a \"good\" show. Eating a lot of junk food is enjoyable but it is not good for you. Now you could make an argument from a possible philosophical viewpoint that the occasional overindulgence with junk food is a form of catharsis, but at this point you become pedantic because everyone understands what is meant by \"too much junk food isnot good\". \\n\\n\r\nIn this way I want to compare Fairy Tail to junk food. It is fun but not memorable. It fills you but does not satisfy you. \\n\\n\r\nI admit that the sound and art is good, but the characters are not that interesting and if you don't like shipping characters then it's difficult to care about them. Lucy is a babe, and Gray is really cool (sigh) and my god, when main characters start fighting does it become fun to watch. And yet this can't save it from falling short of other shounen which I believe would be more interesting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI think a big part of why I enjoyed this show so much at the start was that it was really simple and fun. The characters were straightforward and the world was interesting. The fights were also too straightforward. I read a lot of high fantasy so I understand the rules of making magic interesting to read and watch. A lot of shounen series like One Piece and Hunter x Hunter do it brilliantly without really knowing Sanderson's Three Rules, and even DBZ understood this to a degree. But Fairy Tail in my opinion relies on too many ass-pulls to show main characters winning. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless I will happily recommend this show to anyone who has a lot of free time, and nothing else to watch. Or if you have other things to watch but feel like watching something very straightforward. Because this is how I watched it and I really enjoyed it a lot at first. I think the best way to enjoy this show is to not think too much and let it transport you to another world.\\n\\n\r\nSnow Fairy is one of the most amazing openings you will ever hear.",

            "content": "Absolutely terrible. \r\nThe story is quite horrible because it lacks depth and feels like the writer is just making it up as he goes long. Asspulls after asspulls, plenty of friendship power-ups and sudden pointless spikes in the story when nothing is going on. There are just so many parts which completely contradict other parts. The only slightly good part of the story is a tournament arc, which even then is ruined by asspulls and other spoiler stuff. Sometimes, its EXTREMELY predictable. \r\nThe art is ok, nothing special.\r\nThe sound is good though, except for the fact that some of the music used is just avariant of one song.  The voice acting is OK, Natsu's voice hurts my ears but happy's voice is cute. \\n\r\nThe characters: without a doubt, the worst characters in anything ever, there are 1 or 2 characters who are somewhat cool and interesting but we never see any character development. The main character is just annoying in every way, and they try too hard to make him cool, giving him power spikes that make no sense at times. Supporting characters like Erza, Grey and Happy are just super bland. \\n\r\nDidn't enjoy it at all, the plot is not progressive at all and the bland characters and asspulls don't help at all. I only watched the whole anime because i was told by a friend that the final arc is the best arc in any anime ever, it was the best arc in the anime itself nothing more. \\n\r\n3/10 Cannot recommend it at all. \\n\r\nIf you're looking for a good shonen anime, try HxH 2011. \\n",

Basically every arc they would go to a random place, they will meet a very strong villain and this villain would wreck them and spare their lives but little did that villain know that \"Friendship is power\". While being caught off guard, Natsu would proceed to one-shot that \"very strong\" villain and the end. How boring. You could've watched Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood(A masterpiece by the way) twice or even thrice or Hunter x Hunter 2011 which have well written stories. A waste of time if you're a person who has standards. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 2/10\\n\r\nThey're all generic. Some of them have their own flashbacks but they still remain as bland characters. Natsu is your typical MC who wants to save his friends in times of danger and at the same time wants to be the strongest. Lucy is the best (or worst) example for a typical girl in anime who is used for fanservice but in the actual story.....USELESS. Happy is a shitty, annoying character. Gray is \"cool\" but can get annoying sometimes. The side characters are also very forgettable. I just can't get attached to them. The villains in this anime are just horribly handled (check the \"story\" section again, Every villain is handled like that). One of the worst cast of characters I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nStory and characters are the only two things I critic in any show. If they both suck, even if the animation and music are top-notch, then the show as a whole sucks. \\n\\n\r\n(My first review)",

            "content": "You know, it takes a certain kind of skill and finesse to create a genuinely interesting universe along with intriguing characters and an adventurous setting, then screw that up entirely as the story progresses.\r\nAh Fairy Tail, you and Hiro Mashima have done what I had thought to be impossible. \r\nStory: Where do I begin? The show starts off very interestingly, I'm forced to admit. The magic is interesting, I can't lie. Dragon Slayer magic, Elemental Magic, Requipping, and the Zodiac gates are all well done in the beginning, enough to pique my curiousity. And then of course, as I said before, it slowly progresses intoutter nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nSo we start off with Lucy Heartfilia being inducted into Fairy Tail by Natsu Dragneel, and we get intros of the main group -Erza Scarlet, Gray Filibuster, and Happy- which is the focus of the story.\\n\\n\r\nWere I to give you a brief summary of all the arcs in the story, you would think, 'Well, that sounds interesting'. There are three arcs that introduce recurring characters, whilst simultaneously attempting to flesh out the protagonists. There's a sort of civil war-esque arc for the control of the guild, the introduction of Dark Guilds and world threatening schemes and hyped up villains.\\n\\n\r\nSo why does Fairy Tail 'suck'? Because the resolution to almost all those fights is by the 'power of friendship'. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this increases throughout the series, to the point where it forced me to drop the series at the finale. I kept hoping, praying even, that the story would improve, that sometime soon, they would meet a true challenge.\\n\\n\r\nBut no. Every antagonist they meet is hyped up to the point where there literally was a 'God Slayer'. But wait. There was also a leader that was touted to be leagues above this, and would you care to guess how he was defeated? \\n\\n\r\nHe was beaten by a character that was literally said to be weaker than another fighter, but got a power up out of nowhere. Literally nowhere. No training. No previous indication. How, you ask? Because Hiro Mashima, I answer.\\n\\n\r\nIt kept deteriorating even after that, impossible as it may seem. My personal favorite was when for the sake of humor, they sacrificed the time they needed for training, and then got a massive power boost from previous antagonists. It makes you wonder, if that was the case, then why didn't everybody from Fairy Tail just get some? Heck, why didn't the powerhouses get some, at least?\\n\\n\r\nBut wait, it gets even worse. The season climax, also the point where I dropped the series, was when SPOILERS     the protagonist beat two antagonists who were touted to be the strongest fighters of a rival guild. By himself. At the same time. Just... Just no.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10 (The one is for the potential) \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is quite good, I'll admit. The animation however, is pathetic, to say the least. 175 episodes and they couldn't even bother to spend some money to pretty up at least the main fights. Honestly, the fights in Fairy Tail are like watching animated slideshows from visual novels. Actually, that would be better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10 (Because the Magic circles are nicely done.)\\n\\n\r\nSound: Surprisingly, the sound is very nice. Some openings are very well done, much like the endings. Background music is also nice, along with the combat music. The effects could be worked on, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Pathetic. That one word is enough to describe all the characters in Fairy Tail. I'll give a few basic descriptions.\\n\r\nNatsu: Interesting start. Devolves into pathetic nakama loving lucky moron.\\n\r\nLucy: Interesting ability. But is eventually made a fanservice character for the most part. This also applies to the Zodiacs she summons.\\n\r\nGray: Rival to Natsu. But sadly, not given nakama powerups.\\n\r\nErza: Strong, independent, and also fanservice. Think Quiet from Metal Gear Solid.\\n\r\nHappy: Why does this abomination exist? Why? What purpose does this thing serve? Why? Why, Mashima, Why?\\n\\n\r\nProps to Mashima for making the most badass character, Mystogan, also the most pathetic one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: No. Just No. It's just sad to watch this world go into ruin.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: For the love of NAKAMA!! Don't watch this show, please.",

In my opinion, it's probably the best anime for beginners out there(granted my love for anime only started this summer and I've only seen about 30 different anime). \r\nStroy-9\r\nThe arcs are rather short which isn't something I personally mind. The stories are unique and fun, always offering a great deal of friendship. It's not going to be anything like a story as amazing as FMA Brotherhood or something, but it's sure to be entertaining. Every episode offers great battles, touching back stories, cool characters, and tons of humor.\r\nArt-10\r\nNotmuch to say here, the arts some of the better stuff I've seen. It's probably my favorite art style of everything I've seen.\\n\r\nSound-10\\n\r\nI've watched the dub and the sub. I have to say, a few voices in the dub are a little annoying or don't exactly match the character as well as the sub does, but overall it's a pretty good dub, I'd rather watch it this way actually. I also have really enjoyed all the openings, music, and ends. The songs are always really fitting.\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\r\nBecause it has so many episodes, the characters have time to be really developed. Each character has had their back story shown in depth, creating a good feel of how and why they are how they are. I really do love all the characters of this show. They're all really different but have the same morals when it comes to friendship and their 'Fairy Tail family'.\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nLike I said, it's a series meant to be purely fun. It's the most enjoyable anime I've seen. You'll always be smiling or laughing while watching this.\\n\r\nOverall-10\\n\r\nBefore you chastise me for such a high score, hear me out. It's a series that isn't meant to have a deep, thought provoking plot full of dark secrets and twists. It's main focus is to be fun, which it does an outstanding job of. I would 100% recommend Fairy Tail to anyone who's look for a series that'll make them laugh while giving an action dose.",

            "content": "Fairy Tail is an above average shonoun anime series. It's based on a great manga series, but it does fall a little short of the Manga's quality. However, it is fun to watch, and the characters really do make it what it is. If you like shonoun, then this is a must see. \r\nMy score of 8 is disregarding the \"filler\" that is in the series, though the filler isn't that bad for the most part. There is a noticeable difference in quality when filler takes over. If you are a fan of the Manga and haven't tried the anime then you might be alittle disappointed. If not, then you should find this to be a fun series that has its own little charm.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is Fairy Tail? Yes the \"Tail\" is how they spell it, and the usage of the word is addressed at one point during the story. In a nutshell, this is a story about mages in guilds that battle each other. There are different kinds of magic, and most mages specialize in one type. It is more or less medieval themed, and the main male lead character is trying to find a dragon (his \"parent\"). The story holds strong themes of comradery and friendship. It's about finding strength by being a part of a guild, and Fairy Tail is more of a rowdy family than an organized guild. They are always destroying towns by mistake and just getting into lots of trouble while saving people. It has a lot of good messages embedded into it, and it's also filled with lots and lots of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime holds to the overall feel of the Manga for the most part, but falls short on the quality of the artwork. It tends to be a little \"cartoony\" which takes away from it a bit. There are a lot of inconsistencies throughout the series in the animation and artwork, but it's easy to ignore with all of the zany and comedic scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty catchy and works well, and the voice acting is a little above average. There are plenty of cheesy moments, but it all seems to be on purpose. It is overly cheesy at times, but then they come back around and hit home when they mimic the Manga a little more closely. I can't use the word \"inconsistent\" enough when talking about this anime series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is great, and it's the story that smoothes the inconsistencies out. I love the story in the Manga series, and they don't butcher it too much in the anime. I have definitely seen far worse adaptations. They have interesting but predictable plots throughout the duration of the show, but it really is fun to watch despite that fact. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Fairy Tail are the characters. Natsu is one of my favorite anime characters, hands down. He is the motivational character of the series that drives the others to do their best. Again, he's not as cool as he is in the Manga (by a long shot), but they hold true enough to his character in this series. Every character has their comedic moments, but the anime really does push that trait a little further than its source does.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does end before it should, the manga is still ongoing but the gap was closing between the two fairly quickly. They do end it with a \"to be continued\" so there must be plans for some form of continuation because most series just end with a black hole. \\n\\n\r\nI know I keep saying Manga this, and manga that.... but if you like this series and you haven't read the Manga then you must read the Manga. It's a fun read, and it is a much higher quality. Even with that said, I will repeat what I said before about this being an above average shonoun series, so I do recommend it.",

            "content": "Hello it's me again and this time I wanna write a review about Fairy Tail without spoiling the ppl that didn't seen the anime to much.\r\nStory:\r\nIt starts with a young girl named Lucy Heartfilia, Lucy is a cellar mage looking to join a guild, preferable the guild \"Fairy Tail\", the anime starts as she is in a town where someone claiming to be \"Salamander\" is using forbidden magic on all girls to make them fall in love with him, so Lucy as well, at the same moment Natsu and Happy searching also for \"Salamander\" (a different one) come rushing in and break the spell, inexchange she pays them food and the seperate. Afterwards the bad mage comes back and claims he's part of Fairy Tail and invites her and other woman on his ship, but there it seems he's part of a Dark Guild and she gets captured, when Natsu hears there's a guy pretending to be a Fairy Tail mage he rushes in to her aid and in the battle it gets revealed Natsu is the real \"Salamander\" (again another lol to many in) and a Fairy Tail mage, after the battle is done he takes her to there guild, and this is where the adventure begins.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFairy Tail's Opening and Ending's theme song changes every 13 episodes, so you understand there has been quite some music alrdy, most of these songs are very catchy and absolutely great to listen to, also the background music is very good it changes at the mood and at what character is in screen, if I'm right there are so far 3-4 ost's out alrdy so you can imagine the various sounds that is being heard.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI always loved this animes art but there are a few minor things wrong in it, at the start the battle parts barely got truly animated and where more picture flashes, second you notice when it's a filler or a less important part in the anime, the quality of the art just goes down...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI gotta say any character in this anime can be taken to you're like there's quite some different types of characters that's why I say this, and more and more keep coming. Let's say for an example Natsu is a hotheated but very kind and always fights for his friend type, while Lucy is more shy and very determined char, then Erza... oh god Erza, the woman the man! actually a woman, leader, hotheated... err everything in 1, sorry just trolling around.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAnyone who likes allot of action pared with hardcore comedy will enjoy this anime, also ppl that look for supernatural anime will take a liking into this. I hardly ever been annoyed in this anime at all and that's just because the characters itself make me smile rlly well every single time again :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nMust watch anime, if you didn't seen it yet... yet at all I'd say don't wait any longer because you'll regret it, it's absolutely something you don't wanna miss ^^",

            "content": "Fairy Tail is very overrated and underrated at the same time. It isn't a perfect 10, nor does it deserve anything below a 5. Fairy Tail isn't the best shounen anime ever, it's far from it. However it probably is the best MAINSTREAM shounen anime. Don't get me wrong, I love Fairy Tail, it gets a perfect 10 in my heart, but writing a review based on purely my opinion without any facts wouldn't make it very helpful. \r\nStory: Fairy Tail has an amazing story, the only thing keeping it from a 10 in my book is that it takes far too long to pickup. The story is about Natsu and Lucy searching for Igneel, but the first series mainly focuses on Fairy Tail fighting against Dark Guilds. Natsu doesn't even come close to finding Igneel or anything related to him until after episode 100. The plot of Fairy Tail is so good, but all of the arcs are dragged out for far too long. To watch Fairy Tail without getting bored of it, check the wiki so you can see which episodes are filler and skip them. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for the settings is outstanding, all of the buildings, oceans, islands, towns, etc. are beautiful. The art for the characters is mediocre. The animation was great for 2009, but it didn't get better until the second series. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Fairy Tail OSTs get a 10/10. Enough said.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters' personalities are cliche, but they very very slowly develop. A lot of characters have interesting types of magic too, i.e. Gildarts.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even with all of its flaws, Fairy Tail is still fun to watch if you skip the filler. I got bored and put the series on hold twice before I decided to skip the filler. sometimes I catch myself humming to the music and sitting on the edge of my seat during the fights.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Fairy Tail is a good/okay anime. I can't wait for series 2 to end so I can sit in my cave of a bedroom and binge it in a week.",

Basically, it's just a rehash of dbz-type plots.  Over and over, the difference is that there isn't any real Kurosaki-kun type evolutions and not much in the character development department.  It's a good guys always win show that goes to short lengths to make it painfully obvious.  So it kills what little suspense a show like naruto has in the buildup.  \r\nThe story is paper thin and seemingly has no direction except whenthe bad people show up and the fight scenes take up their dominant role as the unmoved mover.  The last 3 arcs are virtually identical in plot lines and yet, there hasn't been much change to the characters, and in some cases, no change.  I didn't vote for Obama but c'mon, I'm not chopped liver either.\\n\\n\r\nArt could be better, Sound, is there music?  Guess it isn't memorable either way.  Characters are semi interesting, after 100 episodes their former merit runs a little dry.  The enjoyment is above average, because I'm a sucker for this type of show, even if I complain.  And it's really just filler for the next installment of One Piece.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you like the big 3, bleach, naruto, one piece, then you'll definitely like this.  It's a different flavor that goes it's own way, which is exactly why it isn't the big 4.",

            "content": "Ever since it started airing, I've felt that Fairy tail has been among the most mainstream and generic of popular anime, and specifically the shounen genre. If that type of anime appeals to you, then you could probably enjoy this, and I myself liked this anime for a long time when I first saw it. \r\nHowever, as I progressed into the series, I began to question what motivated me to even watch the series, and this feeling continued with me as I proceeded to watch the 2014 continuation of the series.\r\nEventually, I was able to understand a lot of the major criticisms of the showand realized that I was forcing myself to enjoy watching it. This realization continued to sink in until the time came when I no longer found enjoyment in the series. Looking back at this, I have concluded that this anime is in fact, the most overrated long-running shounen of all time.\\n\\n\r\nSo what made it so bad? Here are some examples evident throughout this anime:\\n\\n\r\n-Fanservice being forced into every episode way too much\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail seems to go out of its way to shove boobs onto the screen and expect viewers to find it \"funny\" or \"attractive\" or something else on those lines. If you want to fully understand this, you'll have to go through an episode and count how many times fanservice is used. This would include parts of the episode in which a character's private parts (including the buttocks) is displayed for seemingly no reason and for that reason, is completely unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nJust to make things clear, I do enjoy some anime out there that still use fanservice, but that is often because it isn't forced and thrown at me every few minutes in every episode. I used to have few problems with fanservice when I started the series, but after watching multiple anime that use no fanservice at all, I noticed that it was because they didn't have to rely on it to attract more viewers.\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail seems to not understand what genre it is because it seems to be mixed up between a battle shounen and an ecchi. Personally, I'd say it might as well be an ecchi if it needs to desperately rely on fanservice so much.\\n\\n\r\n-Friendship being used as plot armor so the heroes always win in the end\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely something that Fairy Tail has used far too many times. A lack of variation in the series is quite easy to spot since the end of every arc boils down to the Fairy Tail guild winning because of friendship. I have to be honest, that's quite unrealistic and doesn't give a very good lesson to the audience. I get it, Fairy Tail doesn't need to have morals in the end, but it does anyways, and the morals within the show are delivered poorly and are very impractical.\\n\\n\r\nI could easily compare Fairy Tail to that of My Little Pony since both shows are about the \"magic of friendship,\" but here's the problem: Fairy Tail is a series made for teens, and My Little Pony is a series made for younger girls. Why exactly is this a problem? That's because friendship is a value meant to be taught to children. Furthermore, teens shouldn't be expected to repeatedly learn about friendship through a show for teens when all they need is just one arc that could embrace the value of friendship, rather than having multiple arcs that use friendship as plot armor.\\n\\n\r\n-Using filler instead of just putting the anime on hiatus\\n\\n\r\nI've never enjoyed filler episodes in anime, and Fairy Tail seems to line a bunch of filler up by the end of every arc. As a result, I end up liking the series less and disliking the series more whenever I watch a filler episode. While I can skip the filler episodes, I still find them to be highly unnecessary since they have no impact on the story and will be forgotten entirely by most of the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's even worse is that, according to my findings, Fairy Tail has a full, non-canon arc in which every episode could basically combine to make one big filler episode. This non-canon arc (Key of the Starry Heavens) was boring and stupid as heck, and I can't remember a single time I even enjoyed it. Afterwards, I don't remember any time later on in the series in which any event in that arc was even mentioned.\\n\\n\r\n-Unlikable, underdeveloped characters\\n\\n\r\nInstead of making an explanation on the characters in general, I'll just go through some characters who I'd like to talk about.\\n\\n\r\n-Natsu is and has always been a jerk, and not a likable one. He makes stupid decisions that end up hurting other people and doesn't really do much to make up for it. After all, it's not like anyone's gonna even remember. The only seemingly positive trait about Natsu is that he's persistent, but that's about it. All of his other aspects are either forgettable or just another reason to dislike him. Among every shounen protagonist, Natsu could probably end up in the bottom tier since he's mostly just the result of bad, overused anime tropes combined to create his \"personality.\"\\n\\n\r\n-Lucy is one of my least favorite characters in popular anime, and it should be pretty obvious why, but I'll still explain. To put it in simple terms, Lucy serves mostly as a damsel in distress and a sexualized object. That's really her only two purposes. Later in the series, she becomes a bit more useful, but we're talking about a centimeter-long difference, and a lot of that development (even though it isn't really development) happens in the 2014 continuation of the series, not this one (the original series that ended at episode 175)\\n\\n\r\n-Gray is probably my favorite character, but he gets little to no development in the 175 episodes of the series, and it's quite hard to tell apart the Gray from the later episodes to Gray from the earlier episodes.\\n\\n\r\n-Happy is mostly just for comic relief, and he stops being funny by the first few episodes, but that's only if you even found him funny in the first place (I didn't). The primary objective of including Happy is to act like a little kid and to be Natsu's flying machine. Otherwise, there's barely anything to say.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nIn my honest, unbiased opinion, Fairy Tail isn't terrible, and it's even good on some parts (e.g. nice animation, enjoyable soundtrack, etc.). However, on the grand scale, Fairy Tail is pretty mediocre of an anime, and it's extremely overrated. I could recommend this series to people who are new to anime, because they're more likely to enjoy it than people who have developed a taste over a duration of time. Fairy Tail has its upsides and downsides, but I think you, the person reading my review could have their time better spent watching Gintama, Hunter x Hunter, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, and other long-running anime out there that I'd say are great. Anime such as One Piece, Naruto, or Bleach haven't really appealed to me, but I can tell you that they're all better than Fairy Tail.\\n\\n\r\nSo now that you've read my review, I'd like to thank you for putting time aside to read something written by me. I should probably be doing homework right now, but I felt motivated enough to write this review for whatever reason. Anyways, I hope you can put this review into consideration for other anime that you plan to watch.",

I like the backgrounds.\r\nSound (9/10):  The opening and ending songs are great!  I love it!\r\nCharacter (2/10):  Warning...This might turn into a rant.  Ugh...I'm sick of Natsu and Lucy.  I can't handle watching another episode with them in it.  Let's talk about Natsu.  Shall we?  He's obviously the guy who charges into fights instead of using his head.  Natsu somehow KO'd every single boss even though the bosses can obviously beat him up.  Whenall seem lost and our hero is losing...FRIENDSHIP BEATS EVERY SINGLE THING. *sparkle sparkle* Even if our hero was stabbed to death (for example), the power of friendship would somehow heal his wounds and make him powerful enough to beat Mewtwo.  (Yeah bro, friendship is Uber/OP now.)  It would be nice if they let Natsu lose a battle for once and learn from it to show that we all have to lose at some point.  We can't just win constantly.  Now we're gonna talk about our little dear Lucy...She is weak without her \"spirits\" and keys.  If she lost her keys, well guess what?  She'll just stay at the sidelines and do nothing when her friends are in need.  Not even a punch!  She also takes credit for what others did.  Sure Lucy, you were there when your friends saved everybody, but that doesn't mean you also deserve the praise when you actually did nothing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3/10):  Transportation jokes aren't funny.  Especially if they use it in almost every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a 3 for me.  In the end, I dropped it.  If I didn't like it, doesn't mean you wouldn't.

            "content": "Sorry its so long! But I still didn't cover a fourth of everything that happened in this anime.\r\nWhen I first saw this anime, i wondered whether not I should watch it. With a name like Fairy Tail it sounds pretty lame, right? Wrong. Fairy Tail is absolutely great, and almost everyone who has seen this anime or read the manga will agree with me. \r\nSo, what's it about besides a guy with pink hair named Summer(Natsu) running around breathing fire, and a talking cat named Happy? Its about a blonde hottie named Lucy Heartfilia who is a Stellar Spirit Mage (summons spirits based on constellations).Her dream is to join a mages guild called Fairy Tail. Obviously, she get's in pretty quick, its what happens afterward that matters. She meets people like Gray Fullbuster, a ice mage with a habit of stripping naked, and Erza Scarlett, a freaking powerful warrior mage who does some pretty weird things. A cute girl named Wendy Marvell (introduced further into the anime) who gets easily flustered. Fairy Tail contains a plethora of unique characters and personalities, each one just as refreshing as the last. \\n\\n\r\nSo what's the main plot? Well one of the main questions throughout the anime is what happened to the Dragons? Each dragon had a certain element, and raised only one child. Natsu got fire, Wendy got air, Gajeel got Iron, and each one has the ability to eat their element to gain magic power. However, the Dragons all disappeared July 7th, 777. The question of what happened to them is brought constantly, and is the reason why Natsu and Lucy meet, but it is not the main quest. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime doesn't really have a main quest. Instead, it has story arcs, each of which are events that happen to the guild, or are adventures that the characters go out on as requests.As a guild, Fairy Tail receives requests that the guild members go out and complete and get paid for. It is through these requests, and random events that give Fairy Tail its story and the characters their backstory. Nothing similar ever happens twice. There is always a sense of suspense during every arc right up till the end.\\n\\n\r\nI love watching this anime and its characters. Right now, Fairy Tail is on Hiatus as the voice actor for Lucy has personal reasons. I am re-watching it to refresh my memory of the story, but now is also a great time for other people to start it if you want to get caught up. I hope you enjoy this anime as much as i do!",

            "content": "This anime, when I first heard of this, made me feel giddy inside since I love MMORPGS. Guilds and magic and fantasy setting. I felt for once hat I would enjoy watching an action packed anime again. I'm starting to think now... why did I even bother watching this anime?\r\nI feel ashamed for watching this anime and getting into it. It was appealing at first then left a flavour in my mouth that was left by several other animes. I won't name anyone specific, but when you watch the show for yourself, I think you'll understand.\r\nSTORY\r\nRoughly the story is about a girl who desires tobe part of a guild. Could basically just substitute guild for clique. Any ways it follows the adventures of this young girl fitting in to a guild, seeking guild jobs to pay for her rent and bills and such. She meets another guild member and decides to tell him her dream of joining a guild named Fairy Tail.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the introduction of several characters, you begin to understand all the mechanics of how the guild works. A few arcs later you begin to feel  as if some of these 'arcs' are recycled from other stories. I felt like i was being ringed through multiple different series before an arc was finished. What is sad is the whole guild concept would work well if their was a little more...um... originality?\\n\\n\r\nThere is some arcs that revolve around a lot of the characters and start out well, but the shows target age is very evident.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nThe art didn't stand out for me. It felt similar to other animes. Nothing innovative or spectacular. Just what you would expect from a typical shonen. I felt the art style could have been better. Something a long the lines of Naruto. Naruto felt more fluid. Fairy Tail just felt like an outdated anime. Some scenes felt like the 90's. There is nothing here really to talk about.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThis has been my ONLY fascination of the whole series. The music and the one sound effect they always play when a prank is being pulled on someone. This kept me watching it, even though it felt somewhat immature or childish. The emotional music made up for this a little bit. The main theme song is something that will stick in your head, but you won't feel angry or upset it is playing over and over again.\\n\r\nThe other sound effects are OK. The dubbed voices could be better. A lot better. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nI love the characters personalities. I find them each so unique and I love them for it. But everything else I hate. Some characters even feel like a copy and pasted character from another series that already existed before this series time. Even the clothing in some episodes is beyond uncanny. \\n\\n\r\nEven though I like some personalities in the series itself, I also found an equal amount of characters I hate. Usually, with series I predominantly like, the favourable characters out number the disliked. This is a young persons series through and through. It reflects a lot among the characters personalities and their back stories.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters abilities in the series are somewhat disappointing. Even at times there is a sense of overpowered-ness, which I dislike A LOT.\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis is an age specific anime series designated for those shonen teenagers. If you are not, then it could appeal to those MMORPG gamers in a less serious way. I found this series to be more over hyped then then 3 other anime series that end to be near the top for Shonen lists.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime doesn't have that appeal of sucking you in. It lacks self confidence. I felt like it was half done at times. it felt empty although at times it was too colourful and loud. \\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to enjoy this series. And I did have a moment or two where I was excited. But that lasted for 2-3 episodes out of 100 or so. The rest felt liked watered down scripted material of a kiddy western cartoon. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very stereotypical and didn't offer much to the supper plate. it could have but it didn't. Physical character designs and stereotypical personalities just doesn't cut it for me. There seemed to be very little originality that went into them which sucks since the concept of a series based on a guild looked flawless on paper.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the series is below average for me, the only thing that was well done exceptionally was the music. It was all catchy and fun to listen too.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: IF you fit the target audience and/or like MMORPG guilds, this MAY entertain you for a while or in small table spoons. Otherwise, find some other fantasy based series. This one lacks... pardon the primitive language, but... balls.\\n\r\n4/10",

When I REALLY became interested was I think when the story started to focus on Gray and his past with Ur. The whole time I though FT was some stupid \"comedy\"-adventure show I had plenty of experience with but no, this show is SO much more. I completely underestimated it. I can't count how many times I have cried from watching it. Fairy Tail is indeed an amazing show with a beautiful story. The characters teachesthe viewers the value of friendship and family (and to accept those, even if they have fallen to the dark side.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I put a 7 on \"Art\" because almost all of the women in FT had humongous boobs and that kinda irked me. For the \"Sound\" I was really confused at. Whether it meant the voice actors or all the fighting SFX but I put an 8 to be on the safe side.",

            "content": "I will keep this very brief, no point wasting your time reading a really long review.\r\nFairy Tail had a lot of potential. Tons of it. The story is amazing, and the characters are very well done. What screws it all up is the progression of the story. Things ALWAYS turn out for the best, which gets very annoying at a certain point, because it makes the anime less exciting and more predictable. The most annoying part of it is the amount of times the heroes save the day at the last second. I honestly can't even count the times all the heroes have already usedup all of their magic, they are all beaten down, but somehow, someone, usually Natsu, manages to summon amazing strength to defeat a seemingly unbeatable opponent. It makes for a very predictable story line.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very decent, although almost every female character has gigantic breasts in it, which you may think is typical for an anime, but here it is way way more common, and they don't even make the effort to conceal it.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy watching it for the most part, however all the deus ex machina moments in the anime made me feel very frustrated. It could have been done much better, and as I have not read the manga yet, I don't know if the writer or the producers are to blame.\\n\\n\r\nI give this an 8/10, because it is a very easy anime to enjoy.",

            "content": "Alright, I should be studying, so I'll make this quick.  Here goes my first anime review!\r\nFairy Tail is overall a good anime in the sense that it has a great combination of action, comedy relief, and romance (but not too much), which is really why I've continued to watch it for so long.\r\nHowever, as time progresses, the quality of the show begins to decline.  The plot is introduced early in the story, but progresses VERY slowly.  Unfortunately, this causes the show to feel very repetitive and pointless.  There were times when I forgot there was a plot, and the series remindedme of some American cartoons where each episode is totally unrelated to the next (except FT is in arcs).\\n\r\n172 episodes later, I'm still asking the same questions I did when the plot was first introduced.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, the animation is pretty good.  The artwork is pretty modern and doesn't feel old or outdated.  I'm very picky about how the characters of an anime look, and this series is very pleasing to my eyes.  However, there are a lot of still frames... and the fighting scenes could do with a lot of improvement.  Battle scenes in Fairy Tail are nothing close to the wow factor of Bleach (or maybe even Naruto).\\n\\n\r\nOne thing the producers of this show are really good at is ending an episode.  Each ending always leaves me unable to wait for the next (except for a small amount of exceptions).  I always find myself going, \"OMG, what's going to happen?!  Why do I have to wait a week?! *facepalmpullhaircrycry*\"\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things about this series I can say nothing bad about is the music.  I absolutely love it!  The main theme sends me chills, and I often find myself rooting for Fairy Tail as it plays.  Sometimes I feel like I, myself, am a Fairy Tail wizard.  What got me hooked was the way the directors ended each episode... something would happen, the picture would freeze, and then an AMAZING ending song would begin to play with that picture before the credits appeared.  I don't know why, but I find it beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe summary:\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n1. Good balance between action, comedy, romance\\n\r\n2. Good artwork\\n\r\n3. Good episode transitioning\\n\r\n4. Amazing music\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n1. Weak/Slow Plot\\n\r\n2. Unexciting battles\\n\r\n3. Repetitive theme\\n\r\n4. Long, unexciting fillers\\n\\n\r\nDespite the cons, Fairy Tail is currently my favorite anime and the ONLY anime I'm watching.\\n",

            "content": "I must admit something. I am so utterly conflicted as to whether I can give Fairy Tail much more than a 6. I REALLY REALLY want to. And if I had any shame whatsoever I wouldn't openly admit to writing at least 2 separate reviews and, at one point, giving a solid 10/10 score. Yeah...\r\nSo... the reason you're seeing this review now and not the overly dramatic pile of fanboy dog-shite that I had originally rolled with is simply because I cannot find any good reason as to why this anime is good. Which sounds extremely weird when put into writing. How does one evenknow if they like something if they can't directly point to what it is they're liking so much? Well. I have a theory that involves something I like to call \"cool-guy hypnosis\". It's far from an original idea but put simply, when a character does something in a show that makes other characters go \"wow\", and when that action is placed behind a very iconic and well-made piece of backing track, the experience is immediately considered (by the audience) to be immeasurably better than it actually is. For example, Fairy Tail is relatively average (I'll get into that). But the one thing that elevates it so far above the line of mediocrity is the music. Oh dear lord... the music.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've ever looked up \"badass OST\" on google you've definitely heard of the iconic blend of \"old-English pub fantasy\" (violin, flute, guitar) and heavy electronic rock - I believe it's called 'Celtic metal'. You don't know how well it works until you see it in action, and that's coming from the perspective of someone who isn't all that into metal music. \"Celtic metal\" has to be the perfect style to represent the personality of this show. Its rowdy, its irrational; it prioritizes fun and being badass and I could gush over it forever. But, I'll spare you that and talk about the application. Which is just as important. Put shortly, there is no need to worry yourself. There isn't really any poor judgment when it comes to when and where particular tracks are dotted across an episode. Of course, all the characters have their appropriate themes as well. While Natsu holds onto the more Celtic brawler-type music that I mentioned earlier, Erza, who is a more calculated and precise character, has a very crystalized and orchestral backing track.\\n\r\nI have never seen an OST be so accurate in its interpretation of a world. Every theme represents the character perfectly; every intro sets the climate for the arc excellently and every other song there is to list has that gripping excitement that makes everything seem SO much more badass. It is what every other sound-track should aspire to achieve.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that is, ultimately, where the first short-coming arises. It doesn't matter how well executed your music is, if everything else fails to click then I'm just going to be left feeling a little bit left out. I can name a few times where it felt like everybody else got the joke, but I didn't. This happened a few times and it wasn't the fault of the sound design, but rather a lack of explanation towards key elements of the arc's plot as well as a ridiculous tendency to be very predictable. You won't be able to count the number of times that some character comes in to \"save the day\" while the badass theme is playing in the background. It gets to the point where you can pretty much tell how every arc is going to go. The only real benefit to some COMPLETELY detached stories is that they SOMETIMES bring a minor character in, and SOMETIMES those minor characters are fun to have around. By the end of this 175-odd episode stretch, the only things I didn't see coming was the setup for the next season and the ridiculously elusive plot devices that will probably only be used in the very last arc.\\n\\n\r\nHere's another thing I found to be a bit off. Friendship takes an awful amount of precedent in this show. It's almost suffocating. I almost find that I can't stand to see it be used yet again as an excuse for some random power boost. Erza is the major culprit for this, but It gets much worse in the following seasons (It's kind of cheating to bring that into this seasons review but I think the issue tallies up over time so can be addressed as an issue for both seasons). I don't mind the whole \"power of friendship\" gimmick but every now and then you should have some faith in the characters that you've developed and allowed them to use their own strengths to just sort shit out on their own. It's nice that they all love each other and their guild but do you reckon that its at all possible that the characters work independently of each other every now and then? So that we might highlight some of their individual merits? They may be physically separated but the show dances around that as sort of a non-issue. Like they've all got some sort of psionic link similar to the Protoss.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs a separate and final point, I think it's worth noting that I had a lot more fun while watching this show than I did thinking back about it over the past few days. I hesitate to say that you should actively avoid it, just... Don't go buying any t-shirts until about a month or two have passed because, as I eluded to at the start of the review, I sort of feel dirty for enjoying Fairy Tail as much as I did. I genuinely think that this is the ultimate \"guilty pleasure\" program. We all pretend that it's mediocre, we give it 6/10 on our MAL reviews and say that the characters and story are bad... but... we fucking love it really (interpret that how you will).\\n\\n\r\nAlso,LucyIsAUselessTartAndDoesn'tNeedToExist\\n\r\nThankyouuu...\\n",

            "content": "I will keep my answer as brief as possible while showcasing my absolute hatred for the anime.\r\nLike it or not fairy tail is heavily inspired by one piece and to some extent by naruto. It has nothing new to offer whatsoever.\r\nThe story is that there is no story it just is natsu completing the guild\u2019s mission aimlessly without any questions whatsoever. The main objective is to find the dragon that raised him, which he says every other episode but doesn't actually search for the dragon.\r\nNext is the characters. Every character has a tragic backstory that never I mean never made me feel bad for thecharacter. When I looked at backstory of naruto, sasuke or gaara, I actually felt something, possibly a bit closer to the character. But nothing of that sort here.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are simply joyful with no responsibilities or dreams or whatever. They just exist. They do not have any depth. Even after 150 odd episodes I felt Natsu was the same as the guy from first episode. The personalities of characters was just convenient. The main character is dumb (check). The main character eats shit tonnes of food but is perfectly toned (check). The main character gets strong only when someone insults his friends (check). And an incredibly boring superpower(check). Pink haired Natsu\u2019s rival was blue haired Gray. All the girls were busty cause just because. The dumb blonde heroin. The red haired woman who compared to devil who turned out to be a woman who was strong only when fighting Natsu. Same personality just different colours. Every character had an obsessive lover from opposite gender because everyone else does it. By 100th episode the characters had become tedious and annoying.\\n\\n\r\nAnd dont even get me started on fight scenes. The only word I can describe it is Flat. There were no fight scenes. Just overpowered characters doing wierd ass shit. Which was accompanied by an even shittier humour. Every battle scenes in fairy tail follows this routine:\\n\\n\r\nHeroes meet enemy.\\n\r\nEnemy kicks ass of heroes without breaking a sweat.\\n\r\nEnemy then insults hero\u2019s friend.\\n\r\nHero gets angry and says some cool but cliched stuff.\\n\r\nHero shouts.\\n\r\nHero gets 100x overpowered and kicks villain\u2019s ass.\\n\r\nThis is followed by either of 2 outcomes depending on the enemy:\\n\\n\r\nHe becomes their friend and gets insanely weak(unless he decides to betray them again which never happens cause now they best friends.)\\n\r\nHe is forgotten and is never mentioned again.\\n\r\nThe has no challenges and no motivations or aspirations. He is hero because he is the dumbest character that existed in the universe.\\n\\n\r\nThe next up is vilains. The villains in fairy tail were bunch of crap who were just same people in disguise and were just evil. They were all just hell bent on doing the same thing without any explanations whatsoever. None of the villains were noteworthy or someone whom I would remember long after I finished the anime. There were no Itachi, or Aizen, or Blackbeard, or Hisoka or anything for that matter. They were just a bunch ambitionless creatures who just existed as a target practice for hero.\\n\\n\r\nAnd time after time they repeated the same mistake of insulting natsu\u2019s friends. If they never do it then natsu doesn\u2019t get insanely strong and would have never been able to beat a villain.\\n\\n\r\nThis ends my rant.\\n\\n\r\nThough there were few good things like the animation and music and happy. I liked Happy.",

Nakama power is very prevalent, the fights bar a few standouts are unremarkable and the quality of the story is very inconsistent post the Tenrou Island Arc(till then its really good),but on the other hand, the world is fun, the characters are great and colourful and i always liked the ensemble approach as opposed to a single MC. OST is fantastic and this is one of the few shows where i found the dub to be superior. Also has someof the best art imo\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the criticism it gets, its a very entertaining show and i think would be a good gateway anime as well",

            "content": "I watched Fairy Tail without having read any manga nor having any knowledge of it's theme or plot prior to starting the series. What got me interested in it was very simple and had nothing to do with what the series is about - I watched it because I found out one of my favorite avex trax artists, BoA sang an opening song for the 2014 sequel of the series. I started before the song was release, it was only just announced.\r\nI have to say that I'm glad I decided to watch the show. I didn't know what to have expected but it was surelyinteresting. I'll say this. The ideas for the plots for the different arcs in this anime are surely interesting. As for the execution, that's a bit iffy. Why? Because I have to admit that it can get really cheesy at times. But it's the method that makes the characters grow on you, so when something devastating happens you feel it. You have to embrace this anime for what it is. It goes through the typical rise and fall, where the bad guy beats up good guy, then good guy comes back stronger and beat up bad guy with the power of friendship and perseverance, etc. I bet many would find that too cliche and redundant, but like I said, to enjoy this you have to embrace this for what it is. And that is what I did. I never read manga or knew anything about it prior, so it wasn't very difficult for me to do so. I didn't have any expectations whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nOnce you do this, however, you will see the excellent stories and how they come together. At first I felt the show was a bit childish for me then I realized it became way more interesting and intense and had me thinking and crying and laughing. One thing about this show that stands out to me is that EACH character (and this is no exception) has a particular behavioral trait that is unique to them and I found this very interesting. There are SO many characters this anime it's ridiculous, but it's good to have and maintain a sense of variety.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you get into this anime you wont be able to help but root for the protagonists. Their sense of individuality is also what kept me continuously watching. LOL Also, it took me to the end of the show to realize that Lucy was the main character hahahaha.",

            "content": "Magic, power, friends, guilds, and fights - Fairy Tail.\r\nThe anime revolves around a guild named Fairy Tail. The guild has a close bond, strong members, and a handful of enemies. Magic such as wind magic, fire magic, summoning magic, all sorts of magic can be found in this anime. It's the typical shounen anime similar to One Piece, Bleach, and Naruto.\r\nBefore automatically stating that this anime must be a \"copy\" of One Piece hear me out. In theory, you could say every shounen anime is like One Piece; Fairy Tail is not an exception. However Fairy Tail is just as similar to One Piece, asBleach or Naruto is similar to One Piece. The difference is Fairy Tail focuses more on plainly fighting, emotional moments, and \"friendship\". \\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10: The story of Fairy Tail is pretty basic, there are different arcs for different scenarios. It's what goes on in the story/plot that makes the anime awesome.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: The art is not that high quality, probably due to the large amount of episodes and of course budget/time. The characters are all attractive/appealing to look at which is a bonus.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: I really like the OPS/EDs, and two of the characters in the anime are very good singers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: The characters are really great they make the anime. Their emotions and personalities are what makes the anime shine. The characters voices, attitudes, and abilities are always interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: This anime is a joy to watch, I could easily watch all 175 episodes in less than a month. The anime is quite humorous, exciting, and sometimes emotional.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: Personally, I find this shounen anime much better than some other older shounen anime's because of the character's personalities. They aren't robots, or in a strict society where they must act a certain way with demanded respect etc. They're themselves and I'd much rather have watch an anime with relatable characters than an anime with dull senseless characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The creator Hiro Mashima wanted this and stated this.He wanted a more light hearted story.\r\nThe 1st couple of episodes are relaxing, to get you into the feel of how the guild and the characters are.  The story gets more serious and deep with each arc. Each arc is different from eachother and have a variety of unique Characters.The arcs are short, but every arc is longer than the one before.\r\nSome members of the guild: Natsu,Lucy,Erza,Gray,Happy,Carla, Wendy,Canaetc. Have interesting backstories to them and get featured in the Arcs. Some Characters get developed from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nWhats different about FT is they let background characters have their time to shine and feature them in some arcs.\\n\r\nThe magic possibilities are endless with each character.The character designs are unqiue and appeal to the eye.

            "content": "After finishing the last episode of Fairy Tail, and then reading a couple of reviews to see what other people thought of the show, I was shocked to see how much negative feedback there was recently. So, that being said I figured I would write a review of my own. \r\n*skip the next paragraph if you don\u2019t want a summary of the show\r\nFirst off, the summary of the show, or at least on MAL, makes it sound like it follows the life of Lucy Heartfilia. This is not completely wrong, but I wouldn't say that it is the best way to describe how the showis portrayed. Instead it focuses much more on her friend Natsu who has a rare form of magic know as dragon slayer magic. They both are a part of one of the largest magic guilds known as Fairy Tail, which is how the show gets its name and where all the characters get quests that they complete to make a living off of. The show is divided into many arcs ranging anywhere from about 5-20 episodes each with about 2-3 episodes of filler in-between each arc. While the story does have the ongoing theme of Natsu trying to find his father, it is the quests that Natsu and his friends go on together that make up the vast majority of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe weakest part of this show would have to be its story. As I mentioned earlier, there is the ongoing plot of Natsu and the other dragon slayers looking for their parents, but in reality that is overshadowed by each of the quests that the group goes on, and the looking for the parents things is just kind of there to keep in the back of your mind while they do other things. That being said each of arcs in the show still have a good story individually, that help build the backstories for all of the characters in the guild. \\n\\n\r\nNext up is the art. While this shows animation is nothing unbelievably unique that will be stuck in your mind forever, it is still done very well and matches the overall mood of the show nicely. The animators also did a nice job at making the battle scenes look really nice. \\n\r\nThe sound in this show is just fantastic, there is no other way to put it. No matter how many times I hear the music from Fairy Tail I will never get tired of it. Most of it consists of modern renditions of Irish folk instrumentals which have different tempos and melodies to match the mood. The voices for the actors, and sound effects were done well too.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the best part of this show is the characters. There are probably about 1000 of them and every one of them is unique. Obviously they can\u2019t give you a fully develop every single one of them, but they give you a great backstories for all the main characters and even the secondary characters throughout the story. While I did complain about the story a little bit earlier, this was the one thing they got right. Instead of force feeding a ton of information about every character you meet immediately, they let you learn about them for yourself through speech and actions and then after you have a feel for them they will usually discover something about that character from the past while trying so solve a different problem. This sounds a bit complicated on paper, but when it all comes together you end the story knowing everything you would ever want to know about everyone, and it was just seamlessly woven into the story. I really can\u2019t say enough good things about how well they developed the characters.\\n\\n\r\nLastly was my overall enjoyment. When I first started watching this show I really wanted to hate it. To be honest the first arc is kind of bad, and initially I couldn't stand Happy (Natsu\u2019s pet cat) at all. But as I moved on with the show I was able to get past that. The largest complaint I had of the show was in the beginning, whenever someone used magic it would basically stop everything so that you could see the cool animation as they announced their next spell. But thankfully they slowly stopped doing this until they reached the point where the spells and attacks were much more fluid and didn't seem to interrupt the show early in the series before it became a problem. Perhaps after reading all of those complaints I have the show you would wonder why I would still rate it so high. In reality all of the problems I have presented in this review were very small parts of the show (maybe 5 episodes out of the 175 or so) After giving the show a chance I fell in love with the characters and had a great time binge watching the entire thing with a couple of other friends. With that in mind, I would be able to understand why some people do not like this show. It is worth mentioning that while I personally was able to enjoy this show because I thought it had a good balance of tension and humor, if you are looking for some show that has a really deep message, or takes its self really serious, this show is not for you. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Fairy Tail is a fantastic show. It has a couple problems that may take a little away from some parts, but in the end if you accept the show for what it is, you will not be disappointed. I would highly recommend this show to anyone who was looking for a good fantasy adventure, or anyone who simply enjoys the components that make up a good shonen. \\n",

I will treat it as a stand alone anime.\r\nStory (5): \r\nThe story is the weakest part of the anime. From the first episode you know that Natsu, one of the main protagonist, wants to find his friend/guardian Igneel. But after the first episode, it seems as if he doesn't care anymore. He doesn't go out looking for him or anything. Also, after every story arc, there's another. And it each of the arcs are predictable and very similar to each other. Also, the story makesit confusing to see who's the real protagonist, Lucy or Natsu.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10):\\n\r\nThe art is amazing and visually stunning. It's a great anime to look at. It has the classic anime/ cartoony look to it. Each character has a lot of details to their clothing and their abs. The art gets even better when the characters use their magic. But even though the characters are drawn well and have a lot of details, it seems they were lazy on SOME of the backgrounds and city. And most of the female character's body parts are very exaggerated. But the art is phenomenal overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10):\\n\r\nThe sound effects are great. Every time there is an explosion or anything, the sounds make it seem legit. There's not a lot of things you can say, but it is outstanding overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7): You have a large cast here, but some of the characters seem so bland. Natsu doesn't have much character development. He seems so overpowered, but he gets travel sickness. And a lot of the other characters are one dimensional. But Erza is a strong female lead. she's one of the most interesting characters of the series. She is very driven and strong. Lucy also has a lot of personality. Even though many characters have flaws, they are still fun and great to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9): I will admit, even though this anime has its flaws, it is still such a fun anime to watch. It is very funny and the art is enticing. It is also great to marathon when you are bored. You can get hooked on it easily.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9): I can see why it is one of the most popular anime today. Although I think it is over hyped at times, it still is a great anime and is worth checking out.",

I personally don't recommend watching fairy tail as your first Anime . let's do a list of the things I don't like about the series ( these are just my opinions so no hate no hate )\r\n . Too much comedy , I don't hate all the comedy but they just use it too much so I can't take it seriously . As well as the fanservice , how can you take a fantasy shounen Anime seriously when there is just fanservice everywhere. Now the plot armor where do I even start. if there wasn't the plot armor then almost every one in the fairy tail guild should be dead . Like only 5 people died in the series . I mean how are they still alive , oh yeah the plot needs these characters so where just gonna make no one die . Let's just say that Fairy Tail is not the most original Anime... \\n\r\nI'm just gonna a quick list of the things it copied of of other shounen \\n\r\nCharacters - like the design of the charters , backstorys the over use of friendship\\n\r\nPlot - they plot copied off of some things not perfectly but it still sucky ( my sister put sucky ) the arcs are too short they also make no sense .\\n\r\nExamples of how they copied - Natsu is your typical stupid cocky protagonist looking or wanting to be something, in his case he is looking for his dragon father, Igneel who later (very later) in the series dies. where'd your plot go now fairy tail\\n\r\nAnd to sum this up for the people who say naruto copied fairy tail look at dates they where realised\\n\\n\r\n( the orginal  thing )Naruto : 1999   Fairy tail : 2006 yeahhhh\\n\r\nThat's a seven year difference between the two series . \\n\r\nDon't hate me because of my ( and my sisters ) opinion.",

            "content": "Fairy tail is in my opinion, the best shounen anime so far. Yes, your eyes are not tricking you. I said it. Fairy Tail takes all your knowledge about how a shounen anime should be and throws it out of the window of a 50 floor building. It's nothing like Naruto, One Piece or Bleach. The story is about Lucy Heartfilia, a 17 year old Celestial Wizard that wants to join Fairy Tail, a wizard guild famous for its free spirit. Along the way, she meets Natsu Dragneel, a Fire Dragon Slayer nicknamed \"The Salamander\", and his partner, Happy, a blue flying cat. Being membersof Fairy Tail, Natsu and Happy introduce Lucy to the guild, where she becomes an official member. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is the main reason Fairy Tail has a certain number of haters. All shounens have an axis for the story to progress right? Fairy Tail hasn't got one. Being a wizard guild, Fairy Tail members take jobs assigned by people in order to have an income. Therefore, every arc has little to no relation with its previous one. Of course there are references, but they are only minor and have little to do with each arc's plot. Also, all of you that are used to shounen anime, you know how a battle must last for several episodes right? Well, that's not the case in Fairy Tail. You know how characters take hours to explain their fighting moves? Forget about that. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the animation's quality, you might find it a bit low in episodes that are less important and exist only for \"filling\". In arcs however, the art is beautiful, detailed and magnificient. Compared to its nemesis, One Piece, the difference is easily noticeable. Soul Eater fans might find a small resemblance in the styles of these two. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to music, I believe it's the best compared to all shounen. The background music is impossible to remain unnoticed and helps a lot to put you in the mood. It's a mixture of Irish and Japanese tunes with rock elements. It sounds weird and possibly a failure, but believe me when I say it's incredible. Given that the anime is somewhat medieval-based, the soundtrack fits perfectly. The main theme is incredible and you will find yourselves watching the openings for the scenes and mostly, their music.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is enormous with a variety of secondary characters. If you thought that there would not be enough screen time for them all, you are terribly wrong. As expected, Natsu, Lucy, Happy, Gray and Erza, the main cast, are the ones focused the most. However, everyone else will be on the shot many times while their backgrounds and relationships will be explored as well. The voice actors are also amazing and possibly, the youngest compared to the other shounen. \\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail has everything. Moments where you will have enormous feels, where you might shed a tear watching the pain the characters are in. Moments where the comedy will make you burst laughing. However, there are times where things will get serious and mature. When it comes to action, there's a ton of it. The battles are unique and most times reach an epic climax where buildings collapse and the landscape gets torn apart from explosions. However, Fairy Tail is famous for the huge amount of fanservice it provides. But I will not say more, you have to see for yourselves.\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail is not perfect. Like all shounen, it has flaws, but there are some really good elements too. I consider it the best shounen because it's nothing like you have ever watched, it breaks the rules about how a shounen must be and shines where many anime fail. After a two year gap, the anime will continue in April. You've got plenty of time to watch it and read the manga if you'd like. I strongly reccomend it. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n",

            "content": "I have just finished this series after a long series of doubts. It's the first time I see an anime that exceeds more than 63 episodes (and yes I am referring to FMAB).\r\nNow I consider myself a fan of this anime.\r\nStory: 6/10 because it tends to be repetitive. You find an enemy which wants to hurt humanity in some way, or conquer the world. In the end it is defeated by Natsu & co. and in 60% of the cases they turn out to be Fairy Tail's allies in the future. \r\nEnemies appear for no reason, when an arc is over (enemy boss is defeated)you get about 3 or 4 filler episodes and then, an enemy pops up. Somehow it gets related to Fairy Tail and then you know the story.\\n\r\nHowever it's rated at 6 because arcs are good, even fillers are good. My favourite arcs are: Tower of Heaven (Jellal), S-Class Exam (Tenrou Island) and Grand Magic Games. I dropped some tears at some point, but not because I was sad. It's the emotion you get from the fights and the history behind them. \\n\r\nKeeps the protagonist's objective though. Igneel's search tends to be mixed in every arc as you get reference from someone talking about dragons or mentioning them.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10, animation was good. Pretty well done, colors dance in the screen as you watch a fight between a fire mage and an ice mage (red and blue), and what I most liked about it was the perfect contrast and combination that was notorious in the characters clothing/hair. Natsu being pink-haired and having a black and orange suit with a white scarf, and Lucy with her golden hair and white/blue clothing. Wasn't the best animation you are going to see, but its definetely worth enjoying. It gets better as you watch the anime, you can notice that at Ep 16, fx and animation aren't the same than Ep. 155.\\n\r\nWhat really got me about art was Natsu's fire mixed with the animation, it was really well done, I mean, it looked like real fire. Gray's ice was beautiful definetely.\\n\r\nI almost forgot detailing how beautiful Magnolia is. \\n\r\nA really well done job. Not the best, but nicely done. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. Strong point. This is one of the main reasons I started watching Fairy Tail. Music is absolutely gorgeous. Sound effects are great too, not to mention the seiyuus' work on this anime. Every voice fits every character perfectly. It's not the case that you see a giant ogre with a tiny voice. \\n\r\nIf I were to talk about music, I wouldn't end, so I will be brief. If you don't get excited with the song \"L'Luvia\" (the theme of the character Juvia Locksar), or \"Sannin no Duragonsureiya\" (The three Dragon Slayers), you aren't human. My favourite piece of music is \"Gray no theme\" (the theme of the character Gray Fullbuster), it makes you really want to fight. \"Happy no theme\" (the theme of Happy, the blue cat) gets you ready to see something really funny. \"S Kyuu Madoushi Shoukaku Shiken\" (the theme of the S-Class Mage exam) fills you of pride. My opinion about this is that the OST is perfect.\\n\r\nMoving to the OPs and EDs, they are wonderful. Almost as good as the OST. \\n\r\nI will proceed to tell you my favourites.\\n\r\nOpenings:\\n\r\nNumber 2: S.O.W. Sense of Wonder, by Idoling!!\\n\r\nNumber 8: The Rock City Boy, by JAMIL.\\n\r\nNumber 7: Evidence, by Daisy x Daisy.\\n\r\nNumber 5: Egao no Mauhou, by Magic Party.\\n\r\nEndings:\\n\r\nNumber 1 Kangepiku no ne, by Watarirouka Hashiri Tai.\\n\r\nNumber 6 Be as one, by w-inds.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10. Another strong point. You learn who is who, quickly. I was never in the situation of \"Oh, who was this guy?\". Everyone at Fairy Tail guild is important, of course you have the protagonists and later on, main characters. The \"Fantastic Four\" as I call them, the ones you see in the picture of Fairy Tail here in MAL, are the protagonists. There is other important people at the guild however, strong mages, funny people (which leads to bizarre situations), and of course the master. You are going to love them and hate them, you will embark on a trip of emotions with this characters. Even the villains have their own background that may make you feel that, they just were not evil at all. \\n\r\nOne little point against is that there is a lot of characters. As I said before, I never forgot anyone of them, but there is just too many. A lot of Fairy Tail guild members, there are another guilds, and then a lot of villains (keep in mind that there are 15 arcs, and each one of them presents approximately 6 or 7 new persons, if they are not re-used.)\\n\r\nThe anime is seen from the point of view of Lucy Heartfilia, one of the main protagonists, although sometimes it is seen from Levy McGarden, a mage of Fairy Tail and a friend of Lucy.\\n\r\nI never get tired of watching them, specially during the filler plots, where you see their non-fighting personality.\\n\r\nI liked most of them, to the point of rising my favourite character number to 10.\\n\r\nHad to split them in Men and Women.\\n\r\nAnd so, my favourites are:\\n\r\n-Men\\n\r\nGray Fullbuster\\n\r\nGajeel Redfox\\n\r\nGildartz Clive\\n\r\nNatsu Dragneel\\n\r\nJellal Fernandes\\n\\n\r\n-Women\\n\r\nElsa Scarlet (Elsa is the correct spelling of the name, in japanese. In english we are used to see her name as Erza).\\n\r\nMirajane Strauss\\n\r\nJuvia Loxar\\n\r\nAquarius\\n\r\nKana Alberona\\n\\n\r\nYou will find more about this characters when you watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10.\\n\r\nI don't rate it at 10 because of what I said when talking about story, it its repetitive. I am ok with filler plots, but when there is one arc filled of reused villains that again get easily defeated, you tend to get bored. However, when in between arcs you get those 3 or 4 filler episodes, then you can call yourself happy, it is really great to rest from a lot of fights and explore the Fairy Tail universe a little more. I got bored only when an episode was really silly and had nothing to do with any arc.\\n\r\nNow that I have finished the anime I can't wait to start reading the manga and watch Fairy Tail 2014! It's re-watching worth is medium. I only re-watched episodes that had good battles or character development, or precious music usage.\\n\r\nI consider it one of the animes that I liked the most, but not one of my favourites. However, it is an unforgettable one, the fond you grow with the characters as you watch the episodes is great, making it harder to forget this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMinna-san, I hope you enjoyed reading my review.",

            "content": "I cannot be bothered putting a huge amount of time into this review so here goes. This anime has great potential, however the execution of the series and the cliche \"friendship\" act gets kinda annoying. It reminded me each time of how annoying I thought Bleach was because of this \"friendship\" bond and out of nowhere they overwhelm the enemy. It becomes especially apparent when they're being beaten numerous times to only come up on top just by screaming louder(DBZ). \r\nWorst part of all is the fanservice. I used to read the manga, but it has just plummeted to the point where half the manga/animeis now just fanservice of the heroins. Hiro Mashima just leads people on by the romantic component of the anime which again isn't very entertaining. It is the whole \"I will protect everyone\" bullshit that causes Lucy to love Natsu deeper and cock blocks Gray. Nothing special\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the music in this anime is astonishing. The timing is well executed with great background music to signify the important of a scene of cut to the ending song. Personally, I believe the music the one component of the anime that truly shines. Most anime doesn't have a large array of soundtracks that are used in such a way that actually can invoke your emotions in different ways depending on what they're trying to achieve. I have downloaded many of the soundtracks which I still listen to and enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nFor those who want a generic anime with some funny scenes that even made me laugh until I dropped give this a shot. If you are more like me and prefer intellectual anime this anime isn't going to be your forte. Simple as that.",

            "content": "Fairy Tail is a truly horendous series. A series where despite all of the bad I can legitimately say I liked 2 things about the series. The Sound and the World Building. I find that the world that Fairy Tail is set in is genuinely interesting and if it weren't for all of the other things, to which I will talk about shortly, I would actually enjoy the series.\r\nThat being said this series is the most Horrendous piece of media that I have seen reach the top 10 in a long time. With Characters as bland and unoriginal as they come, The character Designs being\"Based\" off of Mashima's previous work, Rave Master, the story you swear that a writer in High School came up with it while in the middle of an improv class and the fights boil down to I won because friendship. This being said I can see somewhat of what people enjoy within this series and I can appreciate it. But these are issues that I find are huge with a manga such as this.\\n\\n\r\nWe can even go as far as to say that when you're characters are carbon copies of other Shoune Jump Characters such as Naruto, Luffy or Even Ichigo without any of the understanding that comes with each of these characters it becomes an issue. Let's take a look at Gon and Natsu as I find these two have very similar goals, \"I want to find my dad\". Gon wants to find his dad and goes as far as to become a Hunter at not only a very young age but also become a Hunter as a Rookie which very few people have done before. He wants all of the resources available at his disposal so that he may one day find him. Natsu wants to find his foster father Igneel so he joins a Guild named Fairy Tail because reasons. He then actually slows down the plot and ruins any pacing the series had going for it. Effectively ruining what could've been a decent arc.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that but the Fights always seem to boil down to I won this fight because of Friendship, with the Deus Ex Machina ability never being shown ever again. Especially since the fights are what make this series so entertaining to watch it is disappointing that all the fights boil down to the exact same thing. Main Character is being beaten by villain, villain starts laughing, Friendship and then they beat the living crap out of the villain.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the Story, I have to say the story is pretty bad as each arc is like ok we found a flute, ok the flute of death turned into a giant and is threatening to destroy the world. It is written like Hiro Mashima is trying to write the perfect improv that he can think of. But in the end the story is not absolutely horrendous due to this.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention that certain sad moments within Fairy Tail feel cheesy and stupid as they basically circumsize themselves of their full potential by taking away death as a motivator. The best scene that shows this is Erza's Funeral a seen so close to actually being a really good scene that falls flat from its own limits. Here Erza watches her own Funeral as Natsu reaches in and pulls her back to life. Had they left that as it was then it would've been perfect, but they managed to mess up even the Heroic sacrifice.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle of Hiro Mashima takes Heavy \"Inspiration\" from One Piece and his own series Rave Master. While Rave Master may not be as horrible as the other the issue lies with how unoriginal his art style is. He has drawn almost all of the women to look exactly like Ellie from Rave Master, Natsu and Haru are basically Identical twins with different Hair Colors and Jellal and Sieg Hart are legit the exact same character down to their personality. Not to mention with multiple scenes within Fairy Tail basically going down to the point where you just change a few facial features from One Piece and bam we have a hit new Character. While some people may find this not a horrible thing to say, Let me ask you this, if a man won an art show through his own talent, a guy then traces over the exact same thing then changes a few things so it isn't the exact same thing, and then wins the competition, did he really deserve the win? That being said certain scenes within the manga can be seen as inspiration from other manga scenes which I will agree with, but I'm talking about similarities that begin to push borderline copyright.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said I will never recommend this anime to anyone due to all of these issues within the series. However if you are still watching the series and still enjoy it, don't let this review stop you, you are more then welcome to enjoy it, hell more power to you, I'm just stating out what I found was horrendous about this series.",

            "content": "Getting straight to the point, I really loved this show at first; it had an interesting setting, a large cast of unique characters, and what is arguably the most inspiring soundtrack to ever exist in anime. That being said, things went downhill and they went downhill fast. Yes, fanservice is an unfortunate part of a lot of anime. Yes, many of us have likely ignored traces of fanservice in favor of a show which deserved a second chance. But I have to draw the line somewhere, and Fairy Tail made that all too easy; it is almost despicable how often the women characters are strippedof their clothes in combat or put into embarrassing sexual situations for the cheap thrills that draw in audience members. On that note, the body image expectations this anime puts forth are outright absurd; you might as well go watch hentai. \\n\\n\r\nThe true shame is that this show had tons of potential, but there is such a thing as too high of a price to pay. I don't have much else to say other than this: when a show that objectifies its characters as much as Fairy Tail does is rated so highly, I am ashamed to be a part of the anime community.\\n",

It doesn't has a difficult plot or any complicated stuff while the story is amusing caust it is still a good story and you do not really need to think, what makes it very easy to watch. The background music is insane, they have 4 ost cd with lots of songs. you can say that lots of these songs sound alike but i think that is just the fairy tail style. the way they adjust their songs for every scene and how good the songs are on it's own gives this anime an extra dimension. The characters are ok butnothing special. I like the drawing style and think the proportions are good (the boy's have muscles but not to much except maybe for elfman and the girls have some nice boobs). The only thing i really hate about it is that they never bleed. Personally i started drawing because of fairy tail learned some songs of them on the piano and every time i listen to their main theme i feel all fired up. :) and btw if you haven't already watched this trailer, it is realy amazing  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtlsjFlcRZ0\\n",

            "content": "I usually just rate animes on my own list, but since I haven't watched a long anime series in years and this is one of the most popular animes, I'd thought I'd do my first review.\r\nOne of the most amazing things about this anime is the guild that the title comes from, Fairy Tail. Fairy Tail is a guild of magic users that go out on jobs to put there magic to good use. However, they find themselves having to save the world many times. \r\nThe guild members have such a strong bond that they are like family and they are willing to do anythingto protect each other and the guild's name. A really admirable trait about Fairy Tail is that their conviction is so strong that they make some of their enemies become their comrades.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great aspect of this anime is its four main characters: Natsu, Lucy, Gray, and Erza. All four of these characters are members of Fairy Tail. \\n\\n\r\nNatsu has the power of a Dragon Slayer, a fire Dragon Slayer to be exact. Seeing it in action is very cool, especially as Natsu's power gets stronger. He is impulsive and a little full of himself sometimes, but he is also very caring toward his friends.  He doesn't have much character development as a person, but he becomes a good influence on some people as the series progresses. \\n\\n\r\nLucy is a Celestial Spirit Wizard who uses quirky spirits based on the Zodiac. She is beautiful and smart, but she is a little weak as a magic user at the start of the series. However, her kindness towards her spirits gradually help her get stronger as a magic user. As a person, she also gets stronger as she confronts personal issues with her family.\\n\\n\r\nGray has ice magic that can form different things as an offensive force, like a hammer or an animal. Throughout the series, he grows as a magic user and a person as he confronts and his past and learns new moves.  He becomes a good influence on some people and honors his magic teacher. His backstory is poignant and sad, but also engaging to watch.\\n\\n\r\nErza wears armor and a sword that can requip itself to different types. She is cool because she is physically strong and beautiful. She gets personal growth as she confronts her past, learns new moves, and meets new people.  As the series progresses, she shows a vulnerable side, a feminine side, a quirky side, and a maternal side. Like Gray, her backstory is sad, poignant, and engaging.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the main characters, the secondary characters are very good. They are very numerous, with different abilities that are either interesting or really cool. My favorites included Mirajane, Gajeel, Master Makarov, Loki, and Happy. Some characters get some development, but there are too many for anyone to be fully developed.\\n\\n\r\nAlongside the main and secondary characters that made up the good guys, the bad guys are an interesting bunch. All of them have cool abilities to watch. Furthermore, I ended up pitying some when they showed humanity, loving some when they became Fairy Tail's comrades, and hating some when they were just cruel and evil.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to Fairy Tail the guild and the characters, the soundtrack is fantastic. Combining Celtic-folk and rock, the composer Yatsuharu Takanashi created great battle themes, character themes, and themes for various places and emotions. I have several tracks on my ipod to listen to for pleasure and for exercising. I will always treasure the slow version of the anime's main theme.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to its flaws, the only ones lie in its animation and its plot. Sometimes, the animation could be beautiful, especially when it comes to certain places and scenery. However, there are times when the animation looked too CGI for my taste. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot, it is really formulaic. It has Fairy Tail discovering bad guys, fighting and defeating bad guys with a friendship speech and power up, and then doing it over again. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the time, it didn't bother me it because I was emotionally invested in the characters and the guild Fairy Tail. It was fun watching them meet new villains, comrades, and places. It felt like playing a fantasy role playing video game without controlling the characters. However, during season 4, I started to wish the show could explore something else even though some of the battles were great and fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its flaws, I really enjoyed watching this series. As the series progressed, I felt like I became a member of Fairy Tail myself. If you want a fun anime with magic, action, and adventure, then I recommend this. \\n",

            "content": "I'm not a regular anime critic but I decided to share my point of view on Fairy Tail after reading all the negative reviews. I agree with most of them in a way, except I think they can be exaggerated at times.\r\nI started watching this anime about a year back and finished it two weeks ago. I had to constantly take breaks from it due to the story getting repetitive and also took a particular long break from it on a really boring filler arc (since I never skip fillers).\r\nStory: It's a really good concept that wasn't executed to it's full potential. It's not terrible,it's not depressing, it's not sickening, it's... just OK, I guess. There's a lot of \"power of friendship\" boosts and I have to agree they're quite silly, but they manage to make you get goosebumps even after all that repetitive nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Compared to most of the long anime I've seen, Fairy Tail definitively has one of the best animation and art styles I've seen. Usually, on short anime quality is better than on long ones (and I guess there's a reason to it) but this one manages to keep a really good quality compared to other long anime and the characters rarely look like they have deformed shapes like in Naruto.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I really, really like this anime's sound. The intros, the background music, the volumes set for FX sounds, voice volume, voice acting... They're all really good. I am yet to find something to complain about in this point. Note that I watched the subbed version, maybe the dub is crappy or something, I got no clue.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character development could do better. The main characters eventually start getting a lot of development but you gotta watch a lot of the anime to get there. As for the rest of the characters... I think I haven't even heard the last name of like 80% of them if not more. I do love something from this anime when it comes to character creation: Every character has a signature thing they do. Natsu gets motion sick on transportation, Gray suddenly takes off his clothes for no reason, Cana is always drinking, Elfman keeps saying the word \"man\"... I could go on for ever but I'll leave it like that. I enjoy most, if not all of the characters. Even though there's not much development, they are quite enjoyable at all times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite it being too mainstream and having a lot of \"power of friendship\" nonsense, I enjoy it greatly. Silly characters like Natsu and Happy are successful at making me laugh at many given times. The last episode even has a joke that I can still laugh about after two weeks of watching it but I won't be able to say anything about it because every single bit of it is a spoiler. Apart from the funny moments, they do this whole \"power of friendship\" thing in a really good way. I hate this common clich\u00e9, yet when they do it in this anime, I can't help but to get excited and feel just like they do.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm rating it 8/10. I find it a bit higher than it should be but the word \"good\" that number 7 gives it is a little bit too weak. If I could, I'd give it a 7,5 or so. That would be a more accurate score in my opinion.",

            "content": "There is a specific mindset required to watch long-running shounen anime, if u have that mindset and perseverance to watch an 100+ episode long-running show with Magic, Fight scenes, great characters, humor and epic moments then my recommendation is Hunter x Hunter 2011 because its the best of its kind only comparable to Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.\r\nIf you haven't watched those showa, get to them, if you did and you aren't willing to invest in 700+ episodes of One Piece then FAIRY TAIL is a must watch and you're sure to like it if u had any pleasure watching, say, Naruto or Bleach as it's likelybetter although everything depends on personal taste.\\n\r\nIt takes place in a magical world like any other with the FIRED-UP (natsu) protagonist the COOL-EMO rival (grey) and the ANNOYING protag/narrator (lucy), seems dumb? well, the highpoint of the series is the camaraderie in the wizard guild Fairy Tail with its 20ish main members and their challenges and individual growths.\\n\r\nThe character development is great but the guild's development is awesome and makes you feel like you want to be a part of it and join their battles.\\n\r\nIt's also surprisingly very funny, and every character has his/her own shine that add to the series' completion. Even the villains and rival guilds don't go to waste, with every character quirk milked for all it's worth.\\n\r\nUnfortunately the fight scenes are weaker then the average long running shounen and the clear-cut story arcs sometimes stand out as being a \"WTF just happened\" moments, and the arcs are sometimes quite repetitive. I actually made a YouTube video FAIRY TAIL ABRIDGED IN A NUT-SHELL it's a minute and a half long and basically sums up most of the story arcs.\\n\r\nAnd as a final note: There are epic, heart wrenching and badass scenes backed up with some of the greatest anime music of all time that will make you laugh, cry and scream with conviction.\\n\r\nIf you've watched the classics and you know your taste FAIRY TAIL is definitely a solid recommendation for you (I'd catch it before it becomes One Piece length and you lose your chance XD).\\n",

It is not a bad one but it really depends on the audience and how they interpret it. If your a person who has watched many anime and wants a detailed story with an unexpected plot twist Fairy Tail is not for you. But if your a person who wants an anime with a laid back storyline and heart filling arcs about friendship and always wants to cry this is the animefor you.\\n\\n\r\nStory - (5/10)\\n\r\nFairy Tail doesn't really have a story and that can be really boring. Each arc is literally just about losing something or someone important and the importance of friendship. But that can be bad or good depending on your taste. But with each arc they reveal parts of a characters back-story and that is one of the good aspects of Fairy Tail as it can be very moving.\\n\\n\r\nArt - (7/10)\\n\r\nThe art is actually pretty good and is nothing to complain about. The magic and scenery look really cool if you try and compare it to other anime. The character art is also pretty good and serves both ecchi and yaoi depending on the audience. (Girls with nice bodies with big boobies and tall boys with rippling muscles.)  *Note* Fairy Tail is not Yaoi its all on the fanservice  \\n\r\n(\u30ce\u309cA\u309c)\u30ce \ufe35 \\n\\n\r\nSound - (9/10)\\n\r\nThe sounds and music is probably one of the best aspects about Fairy Tail. It has a wide variety of openings and endings and some can be very memorable and sometimes addicting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - (7/10)\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters with unique personalities but some are just boring and too predictable.Some characters are developed and some just never get stronger or are just too strong. But overall there are some really well developed characters with quirky personalities and some just bland. It's 50/50 or half/half\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - (9/10)\\n\r\nPersonally i enjoyed Fairy Tail with the heart warming arcs and their random comedy skits.The action and thrilling fights are also very entertaining and some part just want to make you cry. One thing that is unique about Fairy Tail are the B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L quotes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - (7/10)\\n\r\nBecause this is a review i gotta be strict and i had to give it a 7 out of 10 but i really enjoyed it and it was also one of my first shounen anime. If your new to  anime and you thought this review was appealing, I RECOMMEND THIS ANIME TO YOUUU!!   >:D",

It is an anime that I will ALWAY come back to. If anything I would have to say that when they went to Galuna Island is the only part of this anime I can't stand lol. I always skip thatarc.

It is based on a manga i started reading and had to put it on hold at chapter 78 because i only had 120 chapters. I enjoyed the manga so much i didnt want to read one manga every week. I wanted it in bulk. \r\nThe anime,for me anyway,is a diff story.\r\nStory: It sticks with manga quite well so this i actually an up side for me. And i hope it gets better anddoesn't wind up like SOUL EATER.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I personally preffer the art in the manga. the funny moments seemed a lot,well, funnier in the manga. Another thing is the attack \"sequences\" for the \"special attacks\"...they are cool the 1st time you see them,then they end up becoming obsolete as the show progresses.\\n\\n\r\nSound: That is cool. some voices sound a little not-right. An example is Natsu: i expected him to sound more \"immature\" like luffy (ONE PIECE) or black star (SOUL EATER).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Lovable,cool,funny,....all in all they are well engineered.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: For me,there were too many downsides for me to really enjoy this anime due to the fact that i spent almost the whole time comparing it to the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you  read and enjoy the manga, this piece of work might not live up to your expectations. If not,i'm sure you will enjoy it.",

            "content": "The following review includes aspects from all the anime seasons released thus far. \r\nBefore I start my review, I would like to inform you that I'm writing this review after 3 years of complete loyalty to both the Manga and Anime of Fairy Tail. I used to love Fairy Tail...while I was still naive. I had this rated 9/10 but now, after re-analyzing/re-watching the anime I have realized how poorly written it's plot is and how unnatural the characters seem, it's a 4/10.\r\nFirst I'll start with the good points: The art (8/10) and sound (9/10).\r\nThe art style is very good. I love most of thecharacter designs, the buildings/backgrounds look excellent, etc. and the soundtrack is just gorgeous. But the animation is average and even worse in the 2014 version. The main theme is very catchy and has a unique and epic feel to it. But as far as the pros go...this is it....no wait...excellent, unnecessary fan service (10/10)!!!\\n\\n\r\nYou may have heard several Fairy Tail fans say \"If you love One Piece and Naruto, you will LOVE Fairy Tail!\" Don't fall for this. Naruto and One Piece are miles better in terms of plot, action, world building, etc. If you've watched Hunter x Hunter, Naruto, One Piece, I suggest you do NOT waste your time on Fairy Tail. I regret ever getting into this series. I'm being completely honest, I watched/read Fairy Tail more than a year before I even thought about starting One Piece, I promise you that my opinion on Fairy Tail is NOT biased in any possible way. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Fairy Tail (3/10) is riddled with inconsistencies in almost every aspect. The setting seems good, vast, exciting at first but it's almost never used. Fairy Tail is the perfect example of wasted potential. The magical kingdom of Fiore, with several strong guilds like Fairy Tail, Blue Pegasus, Mermaid Heel, Lamia Scale, Sabertooth, etc. is ruled by a wimpy, childish, weak king. Why? No one knows. And it looks like we never will (no mentions anywhere in the manga despite it seemingly reaching it's climax) He's also never shown doing anything except hosting the Grand Magic Games. He holds no strength and has a fairly weak military. Literally ANYONE could've been the king.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot lacks structure, subtlety,  and complexity. It almost too simple. There is an unnatural contrast between the good and the bad in Fairy Tail. Zeref is the only sensible antagonist to have ever been introduced in Fairy Tail. There is absolutely no foreshadowing or prior information to almost all the major enemies and plot points which I've almost never seen with an anime as popular as this. It's like a new enemy just randomly appears out of nowhere and the plot points where thought of just minutes before Hiro Mashima drew it out onto a sheet of paper. Without spoiling much I can tell you this, only Zeref and Mavis have a proper place in the actual overlying plot. Most characters are not well written and I would have to type in a loooong essay just about that...\\n\\n\r\nQuite a few unexplained plot points. We never got an explanation as to why a Flame Dragon Slayer gets stronger when fused with lightning. (Natsu eats Laxus' lightning and gets a huuuuge power up) Do we just have to blindly accept whatever is stated? Plus why didn't Natsu eat lightning when facing off against Laxus? Seems more like it was made up on the spot than an actual fact, doesn't it?\\n\\n\r\nFace was an extremely strong weapon that was never even remotely mentioned before it's appearance.\\n\\n\r\nMore often than not, the protagonists/good guys will find themselves against an extremely powerful enemy, lose to them at first then minutes/hours later tadah..the enemy is down flat like a carpet with absolutely no explanation to the rapid increase in strength. Example? Natsu vs. Zero/Brain, Natsu vs. Jiemma, Erza vs. Azuma, Sting and Rouge vs. Demon Jiemma, Natsu vs. Zancrow etc. \\n\\n\r\nPower levels are extremely random. If the fights mentioned above weren't enough to prove it, here's more, Gajeel, Gray, and Natsu are supposed to be equal. Supposed to be. But Natsu is always portrayed as being much stronger than these two. He's supposed to be weaker than Erza and Laxus by both hype and rank, yet we've never once come across a situation that proves this right. Natsu has countless times defeated enemies that Gajeel and Gray struggled against...again no explanation..Natsu just becomes stronger and we have to accept that...all hail the unbeatable protagonist! He's only ever tasted defeat against Gray (as a kid) and his mentor, Shanks...I mean Gildarts.\\n\\n\r\nGildarts is a straight up copy of Shanks from One Piece, barely any differences what so ever...so no point in talking about his absence. He's just roaming around the world even when his guild members are in severe danger. Oh wait....Natsu can handle them, he can be as strong as Gildarts if Hiro wants him to. Explanation is for pussies...\\n\\n\r\nPointless/random fan service. At first I thought this was an action, adventure, shonen manga...but as the story progresses it becomes more ecchi-centric. You get naked chicks all over the place. The anime actually tries to reduce it as much as possible. In the 2014 version, we see Kyoka torture Erza in a very suggestive way but at least Erza had her clothes on....well she didn't in the manga. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development seldom lasts long. We all felt Natsu's loss when Lisanna died...I mean disappeared. When she came back, it was still a happy moment, nothing too unexplained and bad but it get a lot worse. Do you remember when Lucy cried a lot and we all witnessed the drama when she broke Aquarius' key? Well guess what, *SPOILER ALERT* she's back and all is good...and Natsu is even more reckless after the year time skip..it's absolutely pathetic. It's like he faces no consequences for being stupid and unwary of his environment. \\n\\n\r\nI would have a lot more examples if I included things going on in the manga right now (as of writing this obviously) but I choose to not spoil the 'fun' for you. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are someone who is thinking of starting Fairy Tail, I suggest you don't but it's only my opinion. You are the only one who can judge it for yourself. If a sensible plot isn't what you need, go ahead, enjoy Fairy Tail. It's got good comedy and flashy fights that look amazing (but seldom make sense) so you could still like it. \\n\\n\r\n(Plus you get a bonus every other episode, more tits!!!)\\n\\n\r\nIf you actually went through all of that, thank you, you are very patient. But there's still a lot more I could've said against this series that I used to love.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "At first, I wish to state that I'm not big shounen anime/manga fan. However, I watched Naruto series, entire DB/DBZ series and I think I'm a bit qualified to write this review. \r\nFairy Tail is a classic shounen with some great additions to already known formula. Like any watcher of shounen anime, we're all quite annoyed with sudden stop in action and some five minutes long talk that we don't want. That's the first thing I liked about Fairy Tail; when there's an action, it's only action. When it stops, then it's talk and then even more action. The second thing I liked is thecomedy aspect; it takes light tone and makes it overall funny. Now, onto the main review.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nSince I'm one of those guys that really want a good story in anime, I was displeased with Fairy Tail. I don't mind not having main plot and that all the arcs are driven to it, but most of the arcs are just random and pop out of nowhere. Of course, there are quite some shocking moments you just couldn't see coming, but out of that, the story is not very good. Despite being typical shounen, I think the story had amazing potential and it simply failed to deliver.\\n\r\nGrade: 6\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nI've seen my share of anime with AMAZING art and Fairy Tail is simply not one of them. I'm not talking about the quality of picture but about enjoyment while watching it. It tends to get repetitive, a bit boring and usually, when there's no fight (even in fights) characters are just standing there with their mouth opening and closing in the same aspect without any other animation. However, Fairy Tail has one of the greatest animated fights I've seen so far and that's the only reason I've given it the grade I had. Also, I like the flourishes of the characters and that they are quite different. However, the thing I don't like is the lack of blood; yes, I'm a bit nutty-driven-blood-fan but that doesn't really matter here. Guys and girls are getting beaten to the point where their bones should be going \"FU**\" but there's 0% blood. If it had that, I'd given it an even greater grade.\\n\r\nGrade: 7\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: \\n\\n\r\nI rarely pay attention to the sound score but Fairy Tail made me do it. From the voice acting to the amazing background music, you are simply forced to like it. Every time main fight theme is played, I instantly get chills down my spine because it's really that great. Voices are believable and they apply to the characteristics of one character. Opening and ending songs are quite satisfying (well ... most of them at least) and I especially liked those \"sad moment songs\". \\n\r\nGrade: 9\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nWith the variety of characters, you probably think you'll get lost - trust me, that's not the case here. I couldn't help but admit to myself that Fairy Tail has the best characters (overall, to be clear) out there at the moment. I don't really like the villains but they're there for just a short period of time so I overlooked that fact. However, aside from that, each character in Fairy Tail is absolutely different than the others; each has its own motives, its own charisma and things that distinguish them from the others. Natsu is probably my favorite shounen main character ever there to be simply because he's ... just likeable. You can't help but to like him; his transportation sickness and then suddenly change to this badass Dragon Slayer and then back to his lame phase ... it's just funny and enjoyable. Another thing I like in the Fairy Tail is that female characters actually AREN'T completely useless. You can even say that they're superior to the male cast most of the times. However, when it comes to dealing with a main villanvillan, chance is given (obviously) to the main character but that is given. Even Lucy, young, overly-big-boobed girl with the lack of anything can still put up a good fight and isn't \"OH, MAIN CHARACTER, SAVE ME, I DON'T DARE TO LOOK AT THAT UGLY FACE\". \\n\r\nGrade:10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nEven without being shounen fan, you'll enjoy this anime. It has comedy, a bunch of amazing action, loveable characters and so on. The only reason I didn't give 10 to enjoyment is because of the lack of a good story to follow everything else. Who knows though; maybe, in the future, it'll get far better but we'll see. What I like about this anime is that it doesn't take itself too seriously (Soul Eater is the example of an anime that went from great to the garbage) even though having few serious moments (Tower of Haven is my favorite arc simply because it has the greatest story of all other arcs and because it has amazing balance of comedy and seriousness...ness?). You will be surprised. \\n\r\nGrade:8\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail is above decent anime; however, it isn't great. It lacks story, the animation is not that great and it lacks blood (jk). I will probably watch the series until the end (unless it drags out like most of the shounen manga/anime) because it's funny, it's loveable and it isn't your typical shounen. The fights are actually fights that are not interupted with meaningless talk, characters don't explain bullcrap about their uber-mega attacks, females aren't there just for looks (but you'll see a lot of looks ... Which I don't like really; those outfits ... I don't even know how can they stay put on the girls with boobs as big as theirs) and the anime is actually fairly decent for a shounen  anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall grade: 7\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Shounen fan or not, I recommend this anime. My grade probably doesn't say that, but I followed my formula of what anime should had and it turned out to be like this. If you don't particulary care for a mind-blowing story, you'll 100% love this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCheers.",

When I first started fairy tail I fucking loved it. However as I kept watching it I started to notice a trend. Every fucking story arc ending exactly the same. I mean what can you expect from a anime with the main power being friendship. This anime uses fanservice to distract viewers from the shitty characters and non existent plot. (I don't have a problem with fan service.) \r\nSpeaking of characters not one is memorable except forHappy of what ever the hell its name is, the blue cat. The forced drama is annoying as hell and the dialogue is cringey as hell. Not a zip of fucking character development is present in this show. I'm 97 episodes in and nothing has changed at all.The sad thing is the fact that all the characters had numerous chances to undergo development. I don't care about any of these characters because they're all boring, uninteresting, and shallow. I'd rather go to church than watch this trash. Make the characters more believable make me feel afraid for there safety hell kill off some characters!!!!! This anime is a waste of time it's repetitive asf and a waste of time.

            "content": "\"Follow the path you truly believe in! That is what it means to be a Fairy Tail wizard!\"\r\nThere are three big animes that anime fans find a niche to: One Piece (^_^), Bleach, and Naruto. However, in 2009, a new shounen anime came into the fray: Fairy Tail. To this day, I consider it the fourth shounen and with Funimation licensing and dubbing the show in America, I thought why not check it out. Does Fairy Tail stack up to the other three...well, it's better than two of them.\r\nFairy Tail is based in a mystical land where magic is key to prove your strength. Inthis land, magicians either stand alone or they belong to a guild. Thus, the one we follow is the probably most popular of them all: The Fairy Tail Guild. Led by their owner Makarov, the Fairy Tail Guild is a family that works and celebrates together no matter how dire the situation is, and the team we follow consist of The Summoner Lucy, Armor Wizard Erza, Ice Wizard Gray, Fire-Dragon Natsu, and their loyal companion Happy. Together, they fulfill duties to society and take on whatever challenge is on their way.\\n\\n\r\nOk, now, right off the back you are probably going to notice something about Fairy Tail that seems quite too familiar...this show has a striking resemblance to One Piece. Art Style, themes, and character archetypes are going to seem very similar when you watch the show. Although, that's not really a bad thing, so then how does Fairy Tail compare to One Piece?\\n\\n\r\nBoth definitely have a sense of camaraderie and yes, Natsu and Luffy are practically the same character. Being that both are not too bright, don't take shit from anyone, and have insatiable appetites. However, there is a big difference between One Piece and Fairy Tail that really have a problem with. You see One Piece has goals: To well...find the One Piece and to become the greatest there ever was. Fairy Tail does not have that type of story yet. The way Fairy Tail starts is that we are introduced to Lucy, who want to join Fairy Tail, stumbles across a Fairy Tail member, and suddenly she's in. Then, stuff happens. However, it's not random stuff that happens. In fact, it is stuff that pertains to our main characters telling us more about their history, where they came from, and how they became who they are now. It's not only interesting backstory, but within the first 48 episodes I have seen, there has already been character development with the all main characters. However, then again, I would believe there would be more time these to see characters develop as I imagine this show is going to be on the air for awhile. Once again, if these characters are now developed then what becomes the goal for them that we want to see in the end? Until that goal is established, I can't really say the story is great, but it's still good nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork in Fairy Tail is quite good. Characters are very defined and very distinctive. Backgrounds are colorful and breathe light into every seen. Although, it does suffer from SOME lazy characters designs. Most of the time characters look like each other just with different hair colors and clothing. Not only that, and this is a bit of a nitpick, but it also bothers me that these characters have typical anime designs with the spiky hair and body types that don't match their age. However, that's only a nitpick, not a real flaw.\\n\\n\r\nSound in Fairy Tail is also quite good. I love the medieval soundtrack as matches the setting of the show. However, OPs and EDs that I have watched so far...are a mix bag. The first OP and ED for the show are great. Then, the second OP came, and I didn't like it at all, but I did like the ED more. Then, the third time, the OP was better than the ED. It's not that they were bad songs, it's just it didn't match with the show. I have watched the Funimation dub of this show, but I did check the Japanese Track for comparison. Both tracks are great, but I have to be honest, I kind of do like the English Track better. I find Cherami Leigh compared to Aya Hirano to be much better as Lucy. Cherami provides that teen girl tone of Lucy but also manages give me goosebumps in those really intense moments of the show. Aya Hirano does a fine job as well, but I feel like she's toned down, which is a shame considering she is known for playing hyper characters such as Haruhi Suzumiya and Misa Amane. Todd Haberkorn, I also find slightly better than Tetsuya Kakihara, because, vocally, Haberkorn fits Natsu better for me than Kakihara. Although, I think personal preference is perfectly fine for this show.\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail is a very fun show to watch. The fights are exciting, the humor is pretty good, and yes there are moments where I do get goosebumps. I love not only our main characters, I also love the side characters, and just like One Piece, I don't forget them even if they are only around for a short time. Like I said, though, my problem with this show is that it doesn't go anywhere. It's just story arc after story arc and that's it. Sure, I enjoy watching this show but how can I continue when I don't know what climax I am expecting. It's this that I'm afraid of one day dropping Fairy Tail and it would be a total shame when it happens.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Fairy Tail has so much potential going for it. It has characters I enjoy and actions that I want to watch. It's a really fun show. However, I can't call it great if it's only fun to watch, it needs a purpose, a reason to go on (the reason why One Piece is so appealing to me). I say if you are a fan of the shounen genre and want an very good action anime, then I definitely recommend Fairy Tail. However, if you don't want to follow another shounen, I would still recommend the show to you, but chances are you're not going to stay with it considering that it doesn't really go nowhere. I like Fairy Tail a lot, and I think it's because it reminds me so much of One Piece, that I do so. I would say what's the point of watching, but I really can't since it's still airing. Until then, I will enjoy with what I have of Fairy Tail.\\n\\n\r\nNote: There is clarification to why Fairy Tail looks like One Piece, turns out creator Hiro Mashima, and Eiichiro Oda (One Piece), went to the same art school, along with Akira Toryama (Creator of Dragon Ball).",

It's also a good series to go back and re-watch as the story unwraps more and more. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is also one of the bests dubs I've seen to date.

            "content": "Fairy Tail is quite simply one of the most engrossing shows I have seen in a while. It\u2019s a show that falls under the action, magic and comedy genres and certainly has a healthy dose of each. It aired from late 2009 to early 2013 so covered a good couple of years and so there was a lot of time to develop so many things and build up some pretty hefty storylines. If you are going to invest the time to watch this, just know that it lasts a whole 175 episodes (and even after that there will be a season 2!) So let\u2019s getonto the review then\u2026\\n\r\nFor such a long show a little bit of background is in order, Fairy Tail is set in the imaginary world of Earthland. In this world there are people who possess magic and those who do not. The people who possess magic are known as mages and wizards (du\u2019h: P) There are also loads of guilds around, which serve as clubs for the wizards and is where wizards may find their jobs, usually being bounty missions and other odd jobs. Wizards may only be part of one guild at any one time and usually these guilds tend to be like your \u201cfamily\u201d. Fairy Tail is the name of the guild that the whole anime is based around and when the show starts, is considered to be one of the most legendary guilds at the time producing some rather stellar wizards. \\n\r\nThe story starts off with 17 year old Lucy Heartfillia, who is looking to join Fairy Tail in the hope of becoming a great wizard herself. Out of coincidence, she happens to chance by Natsu Dragoneel, who is a mage from Fairy Tail and from here he offers to take to the guild. Once at the guild we meet various other characters, notably Gray Fullbuster and Erza Scarlett, whom with Natsu form one Fairy Tails stronger groups. From here on we follow the story as these fellow members go around on missions and jobs and start to gel together right from the outset. However, it isn\u2019t only them that the show revolves around, there are just so many other characters in the guild that will be around all the time as well as members from other guilds and obviously the bad guy who always wants to do some horribly twisted things. So far, pretty standard. \\n\r\nNatsu Dragoneel, a fire wizard, is an extremely powerful character who is always the ones to get the laughs going and while he is a blockhead sometimes, he is the much loved boy of the guild. Gray, is the opposite of Natsu in that his specialty is ice magic however pretty much everything else about them is the same. They both have a sort of \u201clove-hate\u201d relationship with the \u201chate\u201d part being the only side you see, leading to some rather comedic moments when the two lock horns and quarrel. Erza Scarlett is naturally the strongest of the group and her name is well known throughout the land, she is known to her unlucky opponents as \u201cTitania\u201d. While she is the mature one, there is a very playful and funny side to her as well, not to mention she is a bit of an odd-ball sometimes, which really adds to the atmosphere-but watch out, she\u2019s a bit of a badass. Lucy herself is a celestial spirit mage, meaning she uses keys to summon spirits from the spirit world to fight for her. What all Fairy Tail wizards have in common, is their friendship and love for one another which is the defining trait of the guild. There just so many other characters who are omnipresent, each with their own distinctive personalities, but you can find out what they\u2019re like for yourself ;) \\n\r\nThe whole theme which surrounds the show is the idea of friendship and love as mentioned before. The show really highlights how people can get over adversaries through the support they receive from their friends and the theme is present throughout the entire show. There is also the idea that people who often perhaps choose the wrong path initially can reform themselves and also the idea of perseverance and never giving up. In this sense the show can be very fun to watch and has a light feeling to it as well as taking a rather serious stance on things from time to time.\\n\r\nNow, if you\u2019re looking for over the top action with magic and fists being thrown everywhere, then this is show will not disappoint. I don\u2019t recall there being an episode that has been devoid of some sort of action, whether it\u2019s Natsu shooting his flames at everyone or watching Erza masterfully cut down her opponents it\u2019s all there. The show really goes to town with the whole action idea and produces some really wacky scenarios which sometimes leave you thinking, wow, talk about going over the top!\\n\r\nThe comedy is pretty good too, the show is interspersed with various jokes and gags. Some of these are downright terrible but most of them tend to give you quite a few chuckles. Sometimes the throwing in of a joke can make a really intense scene suddenly seems a lot more light hearted and the show relies partly on humour to carry through on some scenes. \\n\r\nNow, as for the storylines themselves, they tend to be quite long, usually spanning about 20 episodes each however here in lies the show\u2019s potential greater flaws. After the first story arc you feel really good, the execution is nice and you really want to keep going. After the second, you feel you\u2019ve seen it before, but it\u2019s still really interested. After the third, fourth and the next few arcs, you get a sort of predictable feeling about what\u2019s about to happen and eventually I can see why some people feel they don\u2019t want to carry on. However personally while I got this feeling after roughly 100 episodes, it still felt like a great watch given how fun the storylines were and while yes, they were predictable, it was still seriously fun. There is also the part where Natsu just becomes seriously OP and just seems to wallop whoever he meets to matter how much stronger than him they are. But are all, this is a fun anime, not a serious one, you\u2019re watching it for the thrill and the raw adrenaline. \\n\r\nThe animation was pretty standard, although some of the actions scenes were really well done. The OST for me was amazing, for such a long show, it had loads of OPs and EDs and most of them very actually pretty amazing, with a few making into my top 20. The soundtrack was what really made it enjoyable to watch, it whenever Fairy Tail started getting into their groove, the music would quite literally make the adrenaline rush through you, and it\u2019s been a while since during action scenes I\u2019ve felt so into a show.\\n\r\nSo overall, this was more a quick skim over the show, it\u2019s so large and so there are loads of things to say, however given that I hope to steer clear of spoilers, I shall hope I have convinced you to give this show a shot! Just keep in mind, this is a show you watch to enjoy and just really have a few good laughs along the way, its best watched casually. \\n",

            "content": "Fairy Tail...where do I even begin to describe this anime? It can be incredibly serious and hysterical within a fraction of a second. It is my all time favorite show for a reason, and that my friends...is because of the character development and mood changers.\r\nThe plot has one overall goal, and that is to entertain us with mindless fun. The show has many different arcs that take you up and down a roller coaster, whether it is a filler arc or one that fits with the actual story, you will find yourself laughing your ass off. The characters face near death almost every arc, andwhile the script writers are at it, they somehow make it to when you wait for the next funny comic relief moment. However, some of the comedy does actually get in the way of rather important moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is actually nothing special, I have seen much better and much worse. Although it doesn't get in the way of your enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks are some of the best I have ever heard. I have almost all of Fairy Tail's music on my iPod. The main song is so upbeat you can't help but feel an intense happiness, even when you are feeling down. Fairy Tail has its own sound, one that is separate from any other anime, very unique. The sound and plot mix absolutely perfectly with the characters situations, serious or funny. They also have such a wide variety, you may find yourself deciding which song is better.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what makes the entire show. I watched Fairy Tail purely for the characters. The plot is not what grabbed me at first, to be honest, the plot in the beginning is quite boring. I even dropped Fairy Tail for a while because the show just bored me, they didn't get into the first arc very quickly. I wanted to see more of the characters skills in the beginning, and that's not what I got. However, after about the 12th episode, I was addicted. This show dove into various different arcs that leave you with tears and a wide smile on your face. Natsu, Gray, Lucy, Wendy, Erza, and Juvia just make this whole show. The whole guild never gives up and fights for what they believe in, their friends. The back stories the characters are given really shape who they are and why they fight, even how they wear their clothes! The only character I had a real problem with in the beginning was Lucy, but as time went by, she turned out way less annoying. The characters improved episode by episode and it is definitely worth waiting for.\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail has ended, for now. It is coming back in 2014, with about three months of filler arcs. So, ladies and gentlemen, don't think the legend is over, it's just beginning. \"You don't die for your friends, you live for them!\"",

The sounds are awesome too.It has good openings and endings (as songs and animation), but in some of them the spoilers are a little bit more... \r\nIt'svery well animated and the quality is very good. The colours are bright and well combined with the background and the activity. The details are good but it will be better with some more.\\n\r\nAbout the fights... there's  not a lot of differnce with other animes-the good characters win at the end, but it's full of emotions and impatience all the way!\\n\r\n P.S First review pls don't hate :D ^-^",

I've always loved magic and powers they put in anime, its just amazing.\r\nAnother reason is the story line. It has a great story line for a lot of people and it is a great starter for long anime series. There is also a lot of different magic that is used in the anime and a lot of brilliant names. \r\nI'm sure if you likemagic and adventure in anime, this series is for you. If your watching dub though, its only released til episode 153, but sub is done. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know about you, but I'm excited for the next season of Fairy Tail.",

And feels for all!\r\nOverall when everything comes together it works really well.

I hate that they brought Lissanna back to life, doesn't even seem she is doing anything, so what's the point in bringing her back?\\n\r\nAlso the explanation to why she didn't die was just dumb.\\n\r\nThis basically makes all the lissanna flashbacks pointless.\\n\r\nOh well, edolas was still an amazing arc.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "*This is the first review I've ever written, so you know. Don't hate, obliviate. \r\nTL;DR?\r\nSolid 8.\r\nThis is a very well paced and easy to watch shounen anime. The chemistry between the characters is created mostly by comedy that jabs in a blunt kind of fashion. It's very easy to get caught up in this series, especially if you have not read the manga. If you have, the suspense gets taken out of it and it's not nearly as fun. The music was good, the art kind of pissed me off personally, and the story is simple and sweet. The quality may not be as goodas some other shows, but it is very very enjoyable. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI think that this series in particular is spectacular at cliff-hangers. If I hadn't caught up with the manga I'm sure I would have rated this series much higher. Knowing everything that happens takes the fun out of these kinds of shows. Now that I got that out of the way:\\n\\n\r\n...Enjoyment... - 9\\n\r\nI want to talk about this first because I think many of you will be put off by the other things I say. I know that I gave Fairy Tail an overall rating of 8, but that doesn't mean to say I didn't completely fall in love with the show. The actual quality of the show may not be as fantastic as some others I've seen, but the show really sucks you in and comforts you. It's such a pleasant story to escape into. I love the chemistry between the characters, which I'll talk more about later, and the overall satisfaction you feel when you watch this show. The comedy is always dead on and is balanced well enough to make you not take the show too seriously. Some parts get pretty heavy and hard to believe in after you see some of the endlessly reoccurring motifs, but it's not so bad that it's unbearable. I was lucky in that I started watching this show from the very beginning. In my opinion, it's much easier to keep up with shounen series when you don't have to watch it all at once. It goes down so much better when you pace yourself. I think that's the best advice I can give to someone who wants to watch this series. If you do decide to watch Fairy Tail, do so over a long period of time. Cliff-hangers can only keep you interested for so long.\\n\\n\r\n...Story... - 7\\n\r\nThe story is like that of any shounen series. There are lots of short adventures with short term goals and good conquers evil. But what's so good about it is that the adventures are paced quite well ( unless you've read the manga then it's like OH MY GOD I KNOW JUST MOVE ON ALREADY ) and are always mixed with the right amount of comedy and a sense of purpose. I don't think it'll be a spoiler when I tell you that the underlying message is almost always stick with your friends, because you know, they're your friends. Now the reason that I gave the story a 7 is because compared to say, Full Metal Alchemist, it would feel wrong to give them a score any higher. The storyline is short and sweet but not nearly as rich as some of the other animes I've seen. There are still quite a few plot twists and many of them are completely unpredictable, but most of the time you'll get a sense of \"dang that makes sense I guess\". Going along with the good pacing thing, the story does a good job of ending adventures but still leaving questions floating around in the air, waiting to be answered next time, on Fairy tail! \\n\\n\r\n...Art... - 7\\n\r\nIn certain scenes the artwork does get a bit sloppy, but most of the time it is alright. This particular art style just really isn't my cup of tea though. I like the kind of artwork in Samurai Champloo ( but I think that that show is quite different, at least superficially from Fairy Tail). \\n\r\nThe colors are quite good and I always love the comedic use of art, but it really peeves me when I see just how unrealistic the drawings are. I understand that this is anime and that it's not supposed to look necessarily realistic, but seriously be just a little bit more conservative in the distribution of boobs and muscles. And because everyone has muscles and boobs, I have trouble accepting Gray because to be honest he doesn't stick out as much as the other main characters to me. I get that not wearing clothes is his thing but when the only thing he has to show for himself is his naked upper torso and overused hairstyle he just doesn't quite fit the bill for me (sorry, mini-rant). Anywho I like that the characters occasionally switch outfits. I think it adds to the idea of a new adventure and helps the story progress. Again I'd like to add that the artwork really isn't that bad I just happen to have a problem with this particular kind of artwork. That's completely on me.\\n\\n\r\n...Sound... \\n\r\nI will say that I really enjoyed most of the music. I love the Irish (?) themed fight music that plays in a lot of the fight scenes. The OPs and EDs were also quite good. Some of them I really enjoyed and others I didn't mind but wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to listen to. \\n\\n\r\n...Character... - 8\\n\r\nThe characters of Fairy Tail aren't necessarily deep and to be honest some of them are almost like stock characters, but the chemistry created between them adds so much dimension to all of them. The story did an excellent job of using comedy as a way to bond the characters together. I did appreciate the valiant effort to give each character such a vivid and detailed background story. There's a general cohesiveness that all of the characters at Fairy Tail seem to share, and that I think also contributes to the characterization. Everyone is so endlessly faithful to their guild and their friends that it creates an enormous sense of community that I think even viewers can appreciate.\\n\\n\r\n...Overall... - 8\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I give Fairy Tail a solid eight. It is a completely enjoyable series but the rewatch value at least for me isn't nearly as high as say Ouran High School Host Club (I've rewatched that like 8 freaking times already. And that's just counting the times I've watched the entire season. I don't even know how many times I've rewatched individual episodes, like episode 8.... alsdkf). I think that Fairy Tail is easier to pick up than Naruto or One Piece or any other shounen series partially because of how well it was paced. There aren't that many grand adventures that take place, and the ones that do are easy to follow and relatively short. This is the kind of show that, if you really like it, you get completely and utterly swept up in it. You'll find yourself squealing out of joy and falling out of your chair laughing in almost every episode. In short, I personally enjoyed it quite a bit and it's pretty rare for me to actually commit to a shounen anime.    Actually this is the first... Go watch it!",

I watched all 175 episodes in a week and after that i became obsessed and waited for the 2nd season for a year. This anime is suited for people who enjoy humour, sometimes black. The main theme is friendship, and how far you are willing to go to save others. You can feel sympathy for all characters in the anime, and some just exist to make you laugh. Fairy Tail brings back old minor characters, and that adds a nicespice to the series. Everything they do has a purpose, they all have goals. Hiro Mashima is a genius and the music is outstanding! The opening themes gives away a bit too much but it's just interesting finding out what they're showing. \\n\\n\r\nThis is by far the best anime ive ever seen and i really reccomend it to everyone. If your unsure about what you think and why you should want to watch this anime, check out this amv\\n\\n\r\nFighting for our guild by The Alexmolly on youtube.",

I't's one thing to believe   in something / someone, but it's a different thing when you cry it out to eyour enemies.   The line betweenfaith and  stupidity is very thin, don't risk your lives just because you believe in someone.\\n\r\nThird, I dislike Anime/manga in which  the enemies are  what i call benevolent enemies.  The enemies are too cocky to finish off the heroes, that's why they got beaten in the end.\\n\\n\r\nStory 5\\n\r\n+To me is not  a big deal  that   Natsu has forgotten that the real  he joined fairy tail is to look for  his dragon father. Because our heroes always  go on exciting missions to unique area with its own unique enemies.\\n\\n\r\n-unfortunately  its contains points no 1 that i mentioned above.   No matter how gravely injured they are, our  heroes suddenly  got a power up  from the power of friendship.  What's the point  of  battles and those powerful moves  then .\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7\\n\r\n+ characters  has unique    personalities that makes this anime really fun to watch.  I really like Erza because she is a strong  female protagonist,. She doesn't  break down like a delicate doll and   need a shoulder to cry on.\\n\\n\r\n  She does  what  she does for herself and   she has strong personality and doesn't mellow out. she's the real  deal Unlike Natsume Maya from Tenjou Tenge and  Lightning from FF 13.\\n\r\nShe  also becomes virtually everything that  you want,  a warrior,  a samurai or  maid.\\n\\n\r\n- point no2, our heroes  shout out their believe in friendship, lucky for them the enemies are weak minded . The enemies suddenly change  their mind and  say to themselves \" oh this fairy tail guild is better than us blecause they believe in friendship that's why we can't beat them\" .\\n\r\n-Point no 3. at one   time the guid master was poised by  his rival and  still alive because  his rival is too cocky to finish him off.\\n\r\n-Point no 2.in the past one of the  guild member( i won't tell you whom because it's a spoiler) died because she was far too trusting of someone.\\n\\n\r\nWith so many negative aspect,  i still could give a score of 7 because along with one piece is one of those rare manga who provides us with a true strong female protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7\\n\r\nit's beautiful and looks precisely like the manga and the art is consistent.  Oh if you watch  Fairy Tail  for ERza and  and lucy's fan service,  the manga has more and uncensored. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI like the girls and the panoramic backgrounds but i hate  the emotional outburst.",

            "content": "Note: This is my second review.\r\nFairy Tail is one of my favourite animes that's currently running. The story drifts away from the usual guy/girl wanting to improve his skill and combines battles with explaining not only the main character, but the rest of the teams past. One of my favourite aspects of the plot is that the arcs are usually based mainly off of one character (Tower of Heaven Arc-Erza, Delioria-Gray, etc.) but everyone's included.\r\nThe characters aren't anything special; there's the strong and confident idiot, the guy that has a rivalry but is still really close with that idiot, the weak(ish) newcomer, and tough girlpeople are afraid of at first. But each character has a story behind them that affects the plot and the other character. \\n\\n\r\nI never get bored when I'm watching Fairy Tail, since the arcs are usually really different yet connected in some way. I just feel that since Fairy Tail is often compared to One Piece and Bleach, people just assume it'll be a typical shounen anime even though it's a lot more than that. It involves friendship, trust, your past, mistakes, as well as battles and pretty original abilities. Give Fairy Tail a chance before you give it up.",

            "content": "The plot is hardly new. It follows a girl named Lucy and a boy named Natsu who are both powerful wizards with a magical organisation as they undertake various mission.\r\nWell, Fairy Tail has a great time and I must admit, and epic moments, but after a certain point to realize the \"power of friendship\" is a stop I just can not endure, or the character is already fuck fuck or you have to show that it is evolving for something and not take power or strength NOTHING ... the fairy tail part nor be a manga / anime about wizards and I understand that, untilthen why is a shounen for what it is for meIt is a good thing, but not particularly for me and look what I see, since the cap 20 around... Well, I just saw through chapter 36 (later dropped)...\\n\\n\r\nI will not even complain of problems developed on top of the main character, but the very development that the mangaka waste created in the plot. As a shounen can be? There are some that will say, shounen is like that, but there Pear fellow super-power of shounen has to do with training and dedication and striking impacts phrases. But besides being a clich\u00e9 combo and misinterpretation of the English guy creates a main character that is not the main character, Naruto appears, which is a waste. Nothing comparable to One piece (which makes Hiro Mashima please copy the shape of the drawing). Well, not to expect much from someone who created Rave Master.\\n\\n\r\nI have no problem that the character lose, but lose to one's foot slipper that are created randomly throughout the series when it is to master a dragon? The guy was supposed to be the fight of genius, he exaggerates out the use of the same blows to which the same used since the super-weak enemies of the start of the series.\\n\\n\r\nGood, has some authors who deserve death. I'm tired of seeing a good story to be destroyed, and stories more-or-less remain weak in the knees, but with a quality developed between the much larger characters.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes I think of \"heroes\" as this would make one hell of a blowjob in the bad guys, seriously, at least the integrity of the story would not get lost.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there is no saying, \"do not look\". I consistently look / read animation / manga no matter how they were trash, because I like this kind of art, but is already getting tired of the way and the talent that these guys have to destroy something created, and the amazing thing is how these weeds can last.\\n\\n\r\nThe idiot novel is also a point to qualify, it is not why is shounen romance that does not need to pay, po boys - men - also love. Heroin is a vin\u00fatil if from nowhere can one powers. Ah, so. To create the Erza?\\n\\n\r\n- Beasts too fights.\\n\r\n- Lack of strategy.\\n\r\n- Comedy exaggerated, sometimes fills the bag, is not balanced.\\n\r\n- Lack of blood, the guys seem made of iron, just missing out sparks like the Power Rangers.\\n\r\n- Excess role in Natsu, like ... say that it will overcome the Erza, most from child to Erza is badass, can it not evolve too?\\n\r\n-Every Holy time they say that they are fighting for Fairy Tail, damn it! I already know that, for stating the obvious!\\n\r\n- And of course, Lucy, the unbearable character!\\n\\n\r\nThere was constructive criticism, but now I only have words to shoot fire from his mouth, the style of the story.",

            "content": "I put off watching Fairy Tail for years as I thought a show with a talking blue cat and ridiculous sounding characters was going to be awful - it sure wasn't perfect but having watched the series 4 times, I can say, I sure didn't find it awful!\r\nStory: 7\r\nFairy Tail has a fairly solid story, however, it relies heavily on a repetitive system - new bad guy threatens the family (the guild), they work together, Natsu beats the bad guy, bada bing bada boom. However, the story itself isn't bad and it has some real shining moments. The Tower of Heaven Arc is especially brilliant- it was both very gritty and emotional and very well written and it wasn't as \"standard\" as many of the other arcs. The Fairy Tail Battle Arc was also brilliant and you got to see the anime which relied heavily on friendship have inner fighting and conflict, which was refreshing.  Fairy Tail does employ some cliches and it relies very strongly on it's theme of family and friendship - which is constantly repeated throughout the series and as mentioned before most of it's arcs have a similar system to how they are made and developed. It gets a bit corny at times but I think people judge this series far to harshly - it did bring some wisdom to the table, it DID have something to say and said it well and though the quality of the plots and arcs range (as it does in many large shows, save for, IMO, One Piece) it is an entertaining and highly relateable series. \\n\\n\r\nWhat does set it apart from other shounen's is it's fast pacing - choking down tons and tons of filler and slow, dragged out pacing in several other of the \"big shows\" gets so old and I appreciate both Fairy Tail's lack of filler and the fast pacing that doesn't drag on like so many others do.  The setting is well developed as well and I do love the world in which Fairy Tail is set.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8. Fairy Tail has an appealing art style - nice but fairly basic characters designs, good use of detail (though not at the level of Guilty Crown or the Fate Series) and a nice use of colour that really made the style \"pop\". It was very well suited to the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10. The OST is brilliant - the WIDE range of pieces are not only brilliant but were used brilliantly in the series to add layers of enjoyment and depth to the scenes and convey the emotions the scenes were delivering. Though a few pieces were used a lot, the OST is actually huge in scope and it's pieces were very versatile. Fairy Tail also boosts one of the best collection of Opening and Ending themes which perfectly suited the series - and the arcs they were geared towards and were the type of OP/ED themes you race to get copies of. Great music and more importantly, Fairy Tail USES it's music brilliantly. The voice cast for both the subbed and dubbed versions (I've seen all of both, more than once) is very talented and did a fantastic job with the series - some fan favorites are in here so you'll probably here more than a few voices you know well amongst the cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7. Fairy Tail uses very basic, been-there-done-that types but I admit, it does use them well. Where it needs help is in DEVELOPING these characters a bit more and even more importantly, not dropping the ball after you have started to develop them beautifully - ie, Erza. This isn't a problem with all of the characters - but with some, there is limited development and it really does take away from the characters quality. Characters like Lucy, Laxus and Gray were really beautifully developed - as was Mirajane and Wendy, while others, like Natsu and Erza, where either painfully underdeveloped or the development that was started was never followed through. I personally really enjoyed Lucy as a character - she is sometimes used too much for fanservice but this is NOT a weak or underdeveloped character. I found her brilliant, her growth wonderful to watch and as I struggled with many things she did throughout the series, she was incredibly relateable. Fairy Tail's characters may be from a rather basic foundation of character types, but it is a really enjoyable cast of characters whose interactions and relationships are not only entertaining but do drag you into feeling that concept of family and friendship the series spends so much time focusing on. These characters also made me laugh on my darkest days and for that, I am grateful. It's a great bunch of characters  but more development across the board is needed to really bring the cast full circle - having caught up on the manga, I can say this problem is addressed for quite a few in the future.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10. Fairy Tail HAS issues - it employs a lot of cliches, the fights are very enjoyable visually but often really on last minute power ups a little too much and characters need to be more development across the board but Fairy Tail ENTERTAINS. It is the show I turn on and binge watch when I'm down or just stressed and it peels away all that, entertains me and makes me laugh. It's characters are entertaining, it's storylines are entertaining, it's music is enchanting and I am never bored when I turn it on. Despite it's faults, I enjoy it - every minute of it and having watched the series  4 times (to the current episodes) I can say that hasn't faded with time. Sometimes I want to be blown away by deep stories, perfectly developed characters, etc and sometimes, I just want to turn on a television, be entertained and enjoy every second of what I'm watching and faults and all, Fairy Tail never fails to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7. Fairy Tail is an enjoyable series that needs to dig a little deeper with it's storylines (like they did with the Tower of Heaven), not rely so heavily on the \"pull it out of a hat\" style of battles and develop ALL of it's characters, not just some. It's brilliant ost, appealing art, relateable and entertaining cast and brilliant use of magic is however very entertaining and the series - faults and all - is very enjoyable. If you're wanting deep, thorough-provoking and mind-blowing originality - this isn't the series for you, if you want magic, battles, fun, life lessons and an entertaining bunch of nuckleheads to make you laugh - then turn on your TV and let Fairy Tail do just that. Fairy Tail is just one of those series that does have problems, I acknowledge all of them but I love it anyway and I won't make any apologies for it.\\n\\n\r\nA tip, don't judge it by it's first ten episodes, like many shows of this length, the first few episodes weren't it's best and it took a few for it to figure out it's pacing.",

Plotwise it never delivers anything too unexpected or original. It's pretty much the same linear arc development with a new buffed up threat. While that makes it sound generic and repetitive, Fairy Tail manages to always be enjoyable. I didn't get bored once, during the entire series. The characters are so lovable, you just want to ''follow'' them to any adventures. You just want to be part of the guild in a sense. Don'texpect the character development to blow your mind in any way. It just does enough to keep you interested. Fights and arcs in general are short and to the point (for a Shounen at least). Which is one of the main reasons why Fairy Tail doesn't feel like dragging on as most Shounen do. Art is great, while the sound part is outstanding.\\n\r\nOverall, Fairy Tail will provide you with great fights, great powers, fun adventures and many humorous scenes (sometimes a bit too many). If you're looking for a series that will keep you entertained and not some grand plot, you'll have a great time with Fairy Tail.",

Lucy, the oh my god celestial spirit wizard, tries to seduce everyone with her big boobs and does nothing all day except whiny and crying Natsu everywhere she goes.\r\nOkay, sure, Natsu and Gray are very OP but the anime is not even realistic! The fairytail guild wins every single freakin' battle! Damn, that just ruined my mood. And lucy doesn't even get better, such a weak and pathetic girl. And too much fan service. Every single freaking little episodecontains lucy screaming for natsu, or yelling for natsu, or crying for natsu. It is getting really really really really annoying...\\n\\n\r\nBut anyways, since it is my first starting anime, I will give it a 7. If you are new to anime, you should probably start by watching this.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "I was not expecting much when I decided to watch this anime. Tbh I was bored so I was trying to waste time but what I realized was I was learning something while I was wasting time. I learned that friendship matters. I watched my little pony before I grew up but tbh this has the same lesson as mlp and that is friendship. As boring as that sounds friendship does matter and I just love thta moto. Its legit the best. Anyways you need to have good characters to make a good series and Lucy Heartfelia and Natsu Dragneel is what made this oneof my favorite animes. I loved how this whole series did not seem like I was watching an anime in anyway. To all those people who dont like to be seen watching anime just watch this and say it is Adventure time or something. I feel like the fan service in every episode almost every minute made me wanna watch the 300 episodes of both fairytail 1 and fairytail 2. You can have the best plot ever with the best characters but it is not good without any fanservice. You see Naruto and the best plot ever but few fanservice while this plot was above decent but had fan service so I put it on the same level. Since these both series have 300+ I spent more than a week straight on both these anime just watching it so I basically know the ins and outs of these characters which is crazy cause I get sucked into the show and I feel like I am in it. \\n\\n\r\nOn to the story their were not as much filler episodes of Naruto which sucks because I actually enjoyed the fairytail fillers because they actually make sense unlike Narutos. Naruto had fillers which made me feel high because it switches up from a dark interesting show to just a random plot about a festival or something random like that. What I hate about the fairytail story is it not completed yet and I want to see what happens to Natsu. Will he become a dragon im so confused and worst of all where the ship. Im looking for the ship to sail like at least in the anime not the manga cause Ive seen the manga okay and it was k. By K i mean the best ever. Chapter 545 is legit the best omg gotta read like legit <3. The storys are great okay mixed with the intro it lit like Bruh I wanna watch it again.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is unique and lit legit one of the best anime art ever I wish I could give it more than a 10 but that is all I can give it which it sucks. The art with the fan service legit gives me nose bleeds everytime. I am legit wasting so much tissue on nose bleeds the lorax is coming at me cause Im wasting these trees. Hiro Mashima will be using the same art on his new manga edens Zero which is what I am excited for even though it is a new series. \\n\\n\r\nThe openings 3, 16, 21, and 22 gives fairytail the 10. It is so catchy I still listen to them even though I finished the show I even want to edit them sometimes and make my own custom intro because fairytail is just that great. Please tell me your favorite intros from fairytail cause these intros are Naruto level or even better.\\n\\n\r\nI talked about the two main characters, Natsu and Lucy Heartfelia I may talk  about them later in this paragraph but I want to leave some room for the other characters in the guild. Lets start off with Gray and Erza. I think it is legit to have a ice wizard with a fire dragon slayer on the same team that are rivals. Gray reminds me of sasuke. To be honest I cannot decide which I like better but tbh Gray and Sasuke cannot compare to Naruto and Natsu. So  Grays past and stuff about revenge is neat how he always wants to kill himself and strips. BTW that aint a spoiler he always strips and tries to kill himself from like the first season. Its cool how him and Leon has a whole history with their master and stripping. Erza is meh. What u gonna be like erza is lit why you hate. SHUT UP. Look Erza's past is sad and she a fan favorite and that big ship with Jellal you know what I think it meh. You see I know she is thic but look her character and the way she wheres armor looses the apeal tbh like I dont want no bb with armor like what. Jellal is lit though he should tap that. On to the supporting characters. So this is about Gajeel. Yo Gajeel is my third favorite character. He reminds me of tekashi 69 and like every emo person but like not emo its confusing but hes legit the littest person out their. He get mad girls to like Levi. He legit stopped all those losers from hitting on Levi with his big BLACK Iron sword. When he was first introduced around episode 60 I thought he was gonna be just another bad guy Fairytail has to defeat but no he joined fairytail. At first I thought it was so neat how he joined fairytail because he legit broke down their old guild hall. His beef with Laxus was intense in the beginning. Wow this was like a month ago when I was watching this and I feel likes it has been years ago. I love how in the beginning he kidnapped and almost killed Levi and know they biggest ship ever now its crazy. Him and Natsu fighting Laxus two was crazy as well and I just hope his ship with Levil continues in the future in the anime cause you know what happens in chapter 545 in the manga aye. On to Laxus I thought he was gone from the series once he disrespected fairytail but him coming back in a flash is crazy. Without him fairytail would be dead. Its crazy how fairytail turns bad guys into good guys left and right. This guy legit was good than turned bad than turned good like wtf. So onto Juvia I mean that ship is lit and I think she just an entertaining character not much to say bout her except hopefully the ship with her and gray will sailer deeper under the covers aye. So another character I like is Romeo that lil kid because in the beginning he started off as a kid in the beginning of the series and grew into a baddy waddy like natsu. He had hope that they would come back and they did. He also old enough to hit up Wendy. Wendy has been rushed I think I mean she became a main charater in the series like 100 episodes in but I guess it brought in a ship with that cat happy with carla so that lit. Some characters im meh on is those two old men it is like those charcters need to be there to make it so the cool characters look cooler but they hella trash tho. Also the fat character and the fast character that I am not gonna bother to look up who likes Levi. Well not anymore huh huh huh. Tbh they need to give that bih to Gajeel tbh. So about the other dragon slayers that came in later I think they just good characters for dragon slayers and stuff nothing much. Sting the poison dragon slayer is cool even though he kept losing to Natsu and could not even fight a dragon he was my favorite bad guy character who is kind of still bad today but I dont think it matters his ship with his snake is cool because it involves beastiality with a snake woohoo. That was all for the characters that I like. I could talk about all characters like that perfume guy but that dude does not have good perfume I bet his perfume smells like farts lol.\\n\\n\r\nIt was enjoying because I was able to settle this as an anime to watch for 2 months instead of constantly having to find new animes and I would recommend the same thing if your looking a anime to settle on for while.\\n\\n\r\nOveral this anime is a 10 again like my last review. Tbh I only like reviewing the animes I like even though I watch alot of anime most of them are bad. Whatever this anime a 10 and you should watch it does not matter who you are. If you disagree with anything just tell me and if you like it to be friends with me and add me and we could talk about how thic these character is.",

            "content": "I will try very hard not to write with my personal feelings about the show. Fairy tail was the first anime I ever show, and foe that it will always have a special place in my heart.\r\nFairy tail is a show about the adventures of a team of young mages who are part of the magic guild named fairy tail. That's really the entire synopsis of Fairy Tail. Please understand that when I say \"Fairy Tail\" I only refer to fairy tail and not Fairy tail 2014. I enjoyed fairy tail, even though there is not a specific reason for that. So, let's break theshow apart! THE PLOT. Fairy Tail has a slight flaw: IT DOESN'T HAVE A PLOT! I mean, sure, there are several Arks and you could consider them plots, but there is not a main goal that the fairy tail team is trying to accomplish. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but I think that the show would have been much better if there was a long term goal. Most of the Arks, however, are very interesting. Next we have the characters. Many people say that Fairy tail characters are not special; that they don't stand out. I strongly disagree, but I understand their point of view. A Guy who loves food, a Blonde with keys and a book obsession, a \"cool\" guy, and a terrifying redhead with tons of weapons. Yeah, they don't sound like much. But they are really unique when it comes to their backstories. I will not say anything that will spoil the series, but remember that. Moving on to the soundtracks. 99% of my music app consists of Fairy tail soundtracks. Yeah! They are that good! Lastly, the Art. Fairy tail has a nice quality and design. Considering that both improve on the second part of the series, I think that there is not much to say here. Overall, I think that fairy tail is a good show, but it could be better. I strongly recommend it though.",

            "content": "I've started watching anime because of Naruto, so it shouldn't be surprising that this series would be one of the first animes which made me love mangas and Japanese animations. I absolutely loved it: from the story, characters and their developments, music, art, comedy, almost everything I must say. I watched ft four years ago and you know what? It is just only now when I'm writing this review that I've come to realize how terrible it was for me to rate Fairy Tail with a 10 four years ago. \r\nThe word which can sum everything up is either Typical or Clich\u00e8. \r\nThe storyis about a boy named Natsu who's searching for his dragon 'dad' who  then meets, Lucy, the main girl, and now both of 'em with other group of friends have to go on some adventures. Typical shounen, I have nothing more to say.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have to discuss art much as it isn't horrible but not that great either. Though the backgrounds were bad.\\n\\n\r\nYasuharu Takanashi, as expected, did an excellent job composing the theme songs. It usually fits the scenes, and most of them give me goosebumps. I personally like many  op and ed songs but only a few are my favorites. Though I have to say, I've always skipped the songs near the end of the series because it feels like those were made for the sole purpose of having an opening song.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are , for the third time, typical. A straightforward lead, a cool lady who acts cold, a guy similar to mc because he couldn't be the main's perfect rival if he isn't, and the main weak girl who always need to be saved. Every member of the guild has 1 thing in common that is, of course being it the main theme of anime, they value the most their friendship (maybe that's why they can power up using that ._. )\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail uses an execution method which is very similar to a daily routine: it's the same, no matter what arc. Bad guys come-Fairy Tail members will be beaten up-Some flashback which always happen to be sad-Desperate friendship talk of Natsu-From the talk, he will gain power-Boom! Enemy obliterated-Let's go party because the bad guys lost, occasionally the enemy will become \u2018good\u2018 and won't be a bad guy anymore, yey!- repeat. With a very very few plot-twist.The jokes and comedy are repetitive: a guy who always strip, erza who will get mad either for her cake or for no apparent reason, Natsu who will start a fight within the guild, Lucy who will complain about the mess Natsu started just to be cute or some shit, happy who won't say anything good but fish (and seriously, I'm sure I'm not the only one getting annoyed about him. And people say he's cute. No captain!) and all the girls doing the fanservice, big or small boobs didn't matter.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned that I absolutely loved it yet I only gave it a 4. My enjoyment then was really different from how I judge and rate Ft now. I was one of those kids who hopes for the bad side to lose. I have mixed feelings for the anime, I like the story, plot of the different arcs, some of the characters and, most of all, the music but it is cliche, corny and repetitive that you can always guess the outcome of an arc. At some point it became boring for me that I even dropped the second season. But for some reason, I still continue to read the manga. I ain't gonna lie I even cried at some scenes although it was VERY predictable (I was a noob back then xD) I recommend this to people who want to see an easy-going, predictable, fantasy anime. Don't be surprised though, if it became monotonous and dull.",

            "content": "I picked up the Fairy Tail anime before the manga and reading some of the reviews complaining about the differences didn't therefore bother me as I wasn't aware of what they were talking about. Having both read the manga and the anime, I feel that the anime is fantastically done and the manga although a little different is equally great in its own right. Now, on to the review.\r\nUnlike the majority of anime that I have seen so far, I loved Fairy Tail from the first episode. The pace of the anime, although slowing down somewhat later on, for me seemed to be a perfectcontrast to the majority of anime I currently watch. The slow trickle of information on a week-by-week basis on other shows (I'm looking at you Bleach) leads to fatigue if trying to catch up and may seem to drag on for those watching weekly. Fairy Tail throws all of that out the window and has the perfect pace. \\n\\n\r\nThere are quite a few characters in the anime, and going on the manga the author has spent time delving into at least a few of the characters pasts thus far. This character designs are well drawn and animated, and the voices are great. The actual story arcs are enjoyable and again going back to the pacing, not tremendously long. \\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between the characters is another aspect that is very enjoyable, there is a lot of comedy but also some tragic pasts and emotional moments which lead to great understanding between guild members who consider each other as family.   \\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are only 48 episodes out at the time of writing, I can safely say that I will continue watching this anime for a long time to come, and long may it remain. As for who I'd recommend it to, to me a major draw of this anime is its universal appeal and I'd definitely recommend it to anybody looking for a new anime to watch, especially those seeking a break from the arduous wait endured with other manga/anime.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is a series that I am 100% infatuated with. It's the first anime I got into and still my favourite. I started reading manga because I became so passionate about it.\r\nStory: While there have been a few plot holes throughout the series, the overall consistency is pretty good. The humour, recurring themes, and consistent unexpected plot twists keep the viewer interested throughout. While the anime does go through some drier patches (as most 200+ episodes do), the universe and its development are very satisfying. I read some reviews that mention that Fairy Tail doesn't use foreshadowing - this is blatantly untrue. The series islittered with foreshadowing, but it is often so subtle that it would take a rewatch to understand its significance. Every battle has at the very least something to draw the viewer in, whether it's humour, romance, extreme circumstances, awesome magics, or just plain cheesy smack talk. \\n\\n\r\nArt: There are definitely better drawn animes out there, but the animation for this is more than satisfactory. I like the fun style of the first 175 episode, much more than the animation of Fairy Tail 2014. It's bright, fits the characters, and works well with the overall tone.\\n\\n\r\nSound: THE GREATEST SOUNDTRACK OF ALL TIME (in my opinion). A mix of celtic and rockin' guitar. I can literally go months without listening to any other kind of music this OST is so good. So many amazing guitar solos and perfect vocals when they're incorporated. If you're a fan of intense battle music, emotional sad songs, or buoyant celebratory tunes, definitely check out this OST. I'd even recommend listening to it even if you don't watch the series - it is that good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are all very well done - especially the main four; Natsu, Lucy, Erza and Gray. Each member of the guild (as well as most members from other guilds) have their individual personalities outlined and develop in a consistent manner. Yes, Natsu does embody certain shonen protagonist characteristics, but he also disregards many of them as well. I've heard a lot of flak against Erza for winning every battle, though each is consistent with her character - if she had the same kind of character progression as the others, I feel it would only dull the diversity of the character arcs (as well, I doubt as many people would be sceptical of her if her character were male - then she'd just be the badass who trumps every time). Each character has their endearing quirks that make them loveable, and form relationships that feel genuine. Much of the series focuses on nakama power, and manages to make it enjoyable and believable within their situations. The gravitating factor for most of the characters simmers down to solidarity for the guild and why each character develops such an intense sense of it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I love the series - as I said before, I am thoroughly infatuated with it. The humour, fanservice, music, characters, and their stories all work in tandem to produce a series that manages to have you laughing one moment then crying the next. The fillers aren't as bad as most animes', and even the cringiest episodes have a few redeeming moments. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Watch this series if you enjoy nakama-based inspiration, exciting battles, awesome power ups, and jaw-droppingly awesome music. The series sometimes makes fun of itself, and it is very satisfying when that happens. Give the series a try. If it's not your cup of tea after the Phantom Lord arc, then you should drop it - but giving it up before then may very well mean you're missing out on something great.",

            "content": "Rating ( As an Individual ) 9\r\nRating ( As an Expert ) 7\r\nOverall Rating 8\r\nFairy Tail is one of the few successful shounen modern day anime.\r\nStory\r\nDespite being a decent anime it lacks a depth in its plot. Set in a fantasy Magical realm Shows starting is decent where it introduces various characters like Natsu Lucy Grey and others through several episodes but soon looses its plot ( Natsu's search for dragon named Igneel)....story advances but never focuses on this aspect. New enemies arrive and the Main characters have to deal with it. They are on the verge of defeat and suddenly get powerful because ofthe power of nakama...( Which feels dull ) but as a magical action anime it has done a commendable job\\n\\n\r\nMore often than not Plot revolves around the past of main characters\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting concept of the series are its dragon slayers and the mystery behind them and there dragons.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nArt is okey.......the backgrounds are static that takes the sheen from its fantasy outlook. It has more of a cartoonish look than a regular anime look. Animation quality is decent. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nVoice actors are good....those of Natsu Lucy jelal and mystogan have done good job...Ost are descent so are the background music played during fights.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nWhat has kept this series on the top with several other shounen are the no of characters. Character designs are good and are easily recognisable. Characters are unique. Characters from previous arcs are present in new arcs with different roles....But the negative point is that the potential of other Characters isn't fully brought out by the writer.....\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Before watching \"Fairy Tail\", I've read and watched Rave Master, which was made by the same person, Hiro Mashima.\r\nSo, watching Fairy Tail is just like watching Rave Master, but this time, I am NOT disappointed with this one :)\r\nSTORY: 9/10. All the story arcs (from \"Daybreak\", up to \"Edolas\", which is on air right now) were portrayed really good and is faithful to the manga. There are some filler arcs (like the Dragonoid one) and episodes (episode 50!) though, but you wouldn't notice it since you're really enjoying every episode. The story arcs are not that long, but long enough for you to get thewhole picture. For me, Jellal's story arc is the best one yet.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10. All the characters where drawn good, although you'll really see the similarities between Rave and FT. Natsu = Haru; Gray = Musica; Lucy = Ellie; Sieg  Hart = Jellal/Siegfried/Mystogan (I know. @-)); and some more to come. See, even Plue's with Natsu and the gang in this one. Animation's done well too :)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10. The OPs and EDs are really good and catchy, even the OVA has its own OP and ED. All of the seiyuu who contributed to the OST (especially Kakihara Tetsuya!) were awesome. The BGMs (especially the Kan Kan and the Pomp and Circumstance) were also really appropriate with the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10/10. There is no main character here; everyone in Fairy Tail, even the \"evil ones\", have/had/will have their shining moments here. Still, my favorite will be Team Natsu, especially Gray. So yeah, I got this huge crush on the guy who strips a lot (LOL). All the guys and girls' personalities are portrayed perfectly (i.e, Gray's stripping habit, Natsu's motion sickness, Erza's sweet cravings, and many more...) as if you know them personally.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10. I've watched (and dropped some) shounen anime before, but Fairy Tail is one of those that I won't be bored of for at least hundred more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10/10. All anime has their own flaws and strengths, and it's up to the watchers to stay with it or leave it. For me, I guess Hiro Mashima did another good job in making me addicted to his works... again. Though not the best anime in the world, I must say that since I'm looking forward for another episode per week, I'm hooked.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, Happy and Aisaka Taiga's (from Toradora!) seiyuu are the same. FYI though. :D\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy watching!",

This si better.First of all, all the characters get roles. I hate animes where you have one good guy fighting to save the world, and the rest are sidekicks.In Fairy Tail, you get a variety of people:different characters, pasts, abilities, secrets.... These of course make the arcs enjoyable, and there are times when I teared up, times when I laughed. Oh, and one more thing. I love the openings. \r\nSo, to summarize, you totally gotta check FairyTail out. You will be in love like me.",

Honestly, a shonen if there ever was one.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\n Every episode there has to be some kind of ridiculously massive fight scene in which there's just no way the characters could possibly pull through... then something happens and low and behold he won. Or at least it appears so, but there are several battles the main character actually loses, badly. The constant fight scenes make the story impossible to tell, butdue to the epicosity of the arcs and massiveness of budget the story is quite clear. It's a little cheesy and often overdone but it doesn't get old because there's just so much going on all the time, one just seems to become attached to the characters. Honestly for plot just consider this a remake of Dragon Ball Z, those of you old enough might remember a similar complex between yourselves and watching DBZ on Toonami... did you know Mexico got it before us? WTF!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe visual candy in this show is stunning and character designs are quite charming. I'm not sure who they were trying to attract with the massive bosoms though, they seem out of place...I guess it's for the horny teens? The effects are amazing as well. The character designs are all generic but what can you expect from a shonen of this caliber. Though I do appreciate the differences in the faces of both male and female characters. The color is vivid and pleasant to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe voices are wonderful and fit the characters beautifully in Japanese. The dubbed version is alright but some voices leave something to be desired like Levy instead of sounding sweet (jap) sounds like a surfer (eng). The sound track is all it's own, I was rather impressed by it's originality. The opening themes are fun to watch and illustrate the show well. I actually enjoyed watching some of the ending themes as well, also good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nBe aware, the character designers were geniuses, you'll find yourself growing more and more attached to the characters as the show goes on, to the point where you'll be holding back tears when something devastating happens, or even something extremely heartwarming. Truly the characters are a thing of wonder.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nReally a fun show to watch. Be sure you're not holding anything sharp while you watch it, I'm serious, you'll be totally brain dead by the end of the episode... in kind of a good way. It's an anime that you really don't have to think about.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a sappy version of DBZ, that's all there is to it. Viewer discretion advised.",

According to the manga, the anime will start picking up really fast, which is one of the reasons im watching an on-going anime in the first place.\r\nThe story seems flexible atthis point, the art is much like one piece.

Analyzing the anime objectively everything but the story stands out well. \r\nThis maybe because of 2 reasons\r\n1. The manga has not reached a point where the story must get serious and bring in a solid plot line or\r\n2. Mashima had never thought much about where the anime/manga had to go, since he planned to end it way back. \r\nOne thing I absolutely love about fairy tail is the background music. Its so amazing that it makes even the most uselessscenes look awesome, and the art deserves a 9/10 as well since this is definitely one of the best animated long running series till date. The character development is good but could be better. And certain arcs are there just for the fun of it rather than affecting the main plot in any way. The series though in all aspects is very enjoyable and does not have many fillers in comparison. Overall I give it an 8/10\\n",

Same old same old, and of course what pissing me off most if that somehow, with almost no reason they get superstrong they almost never train especially the main characters natsu, gray, lucy and erza are ridiculous how strong they never get beat up, and if they did they always find a way to beat that guy somehow.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion this anime is the masterpiece of SJ have everything that they want is simple, hundred os possibility to make more history, possible to make games and all those things that's toys dolls and everything that make it profitable, but i don't like it and if you do have more time you should watch any other anime is more worth that this one",

It's basically like watching someone else play an extremely drawn out and unfunny RPG. \r\nThe characters are bad. If you've seen Fullmetal Alchemist they're all basically Ed when he gets comically angry. All of the characters are like that. 95% of the time. But every now and then there's this sliver where a character gets serious, and they say something like, \"'I don't give a shit'\u2014death stare\u2014'I'll do what I think is right.\" You get excited andthink this is where the character development begins but then, not three seconds later, Lucy or Happy ruin the moment by screaming something like, \"OMGTHEYREREALLYSCARYWTFAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!\" and the show returns to trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator.\\n\\n\r\nI'm amazed that, at the time of writing this, the show is in the top 200. Maybe the manga has a different feel since you can imagine the characters the way you want and fans of that are driving the numbers up but the anime is just awful. People love to say Naruto is shit but at least Naruto gets to the point. I still don't know what the point of this show aside from \"Let's do magic!\" It lacks plot, lacks any interesting characters and is overall mind-numbing.",

In terms of characters they're all unique but their personalitys basically ruin the anime for you. There is hardly any character development for anybody.

            "content": "This is one of the story that doesn't strict to their main storyline. Unlike Naruto or One Piece, Fairy tail is more of freeroam anime (if you want to put it that way). The main character Natsu dosen't have an objective in life, it just that every conflict comes up the Fairy Tail members will always fight it out. And there is a lot of freetime in the anime too, so is really fun to see what conflict comes next and how they sort it out, the freetime usually happen after the conflict which really logical.\r\nTake Example from Naruto, his objectives in live is tobecome a Hokage and also (In Shipudden version) bring back Sasuke to the village, which is very nobel things to do, and the way to get there is not easy, but when Naruto finally become a Hokage and Sasuke return home than what happen next? Nothing.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is why the story in the newest sequal of the manga version which is Boruto more focus on the next generation ninja. The main character Boruto (Naruto Son) it self doesn't have an objective in life, at least not yet.\\n\\n\r\nNot trying to compare here but Fairy Tail is not like that, the storyline always go forward from the last one and it been like that ever since. Characters in the anime it self really have a style into it, really love those tattoos in each of the guild members.\\n\\n\r\nRecommend watch the anime from the first episode, yes in that episode the graphic quality still bad but in Fairy Tail 2014 the animation got better. Can't wait 'till the second movies comes up.",

            "content": "[STORY: 6/10]\r\nThe story for this show is structured by multiple arcs that deal with its set of villains and threats to the members of the guild of Fairy Tail. This is a battle shounen that comes a bit above the rest. While the story isn't something game-changing, it provides us with interesting changes to the world this show is set in and the people living in it. I've made this comparison more than once, but I can tell Fairy Tail is inspired by One Piece. It isn't inherently bad to have some inspiration, but Fairy Tail just feels like a lackluster One Piece, and Ihave no other way to describe it. It has great character design and interesting lands that they visit throughout the story, but that extra emotional depth and character development intertwined within One Piece's story feels missing here, and that is really important to see. If the story has not much impact on you besides you growing in physical power, it isn't relatable to your audience.  I'm not saying Fairy Tail completely lacks this, but it isn't exactly brimming with it either.\\n\\n\r\n[ART: 7/10]\\n\r\nWhile the art (especially for the first part) of Fairy Tail isn't that amazing, the character designs are really what give the characters a sense of personality. They have pretty unique designs and stand out to me, which is always good when you have a show filled to the brim with different characters we need to follow and remember. The art is improved for the \"sequel\", which is much appreciated.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND: 7/10]\\n\r\nFairy Tail has quality voice acting, though some of its themes can get old after hearing them so many times, but overall the sound department is handled well enough.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER: 6/10]\\n\r\nThere characters are either great or clich\u00e9, nothing really in between. While I gave praise to the character designs, that doesn't mean they are as well designed on the inside. Alot of characters are given motivations and traits, but only a select few feel truly special and stand out in that regard.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 6/10]\\n\r\nWhile Fairy Tail has its ups and downs, it is still a slightly enjoyable battle shounen that's worth a shot if you enjoy those types of shows. Its filler may not be great, but the real material isn't as bad. Don't be afraid to give it a chance, but don't expect anything like a classic out of this series.",

I think everything about it is amazing, the plot is great because unlike other shounen anime (Naruto and Bleach) there isn't that much filler. It was the first anime I ever watched and still the best.\r\nStory:10\r\nThe reason the plot is so great is because there is a bond that fairy tail wizards have with each other that cannot be broken and no matter how cheesy it sounds I love it. Together they face dilemmas and together they pull through. The battles don't drag on forever but they aren't too short either.The battles are great to watch and the arcs get better and better.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nThe art is great there is a lot of colour and the characters are drawn well, there is nothing wrong with the art and Hiro Mashima made everything perfect in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe themes are all great and really get you to love the anime even more and the openings just get you ready to enjoy it from the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThe characters are the best thing about Fairy Tail because they all have unique traits about them and powers too. Natsu is my personal favourite, he is just so motivating, funny and he is the most bad ass character by far. But Lucy, Gray, Erza and Happy are great too. There is no one in this anime that I hate or find annoying. I know that people might think Lucy is weak but she really isn't. She is easily the most powerful Celestial Wizard there is. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nYou could probably guess that my enjoyment would be 10 but yeah, it really is the best anime I have ever watched. Obviously not everyone will love it like me but if you are reading this then you know that it is pretty good. 8.25 is a pretty good score but I think it deserves better.",

Don't let my opinion decide whether you'd like to watch this show or not, watch and form your own opinion. I'm simply writing this review to vent, essentially. I'd like to ask that you don't take any of this too seriously.\r\nPros:\r\nI'm not the type of guy to criticize Art, I'm relatively indifferent to this aspect as it rarely impedes my enjoyment. I'll tell you this though, if you're looking for a nostalgic One Piece feel, this should fit your criteria (art-wise anyways). Due to my personal bias,this definitely bumped the show up a few notches.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is quite memorable. It does it's job. The battle music is very \"action-y\", for a lack of a better term, and gets manages to get you hyped without fail.\\n\\n\r\nThe story as well as the lore of the of the anime were quite refreshing. It may have been that I was just craving another anime revolving around guilds and mages, but I found it quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nThe characters are obnoxious. Dear God do they annoy me so. Why you ask? Well let's start with the main character. \\n\r\nThe main character is stupid. Yes, stupid. Like all shounen anime main characters, the main character has to be obligatorily mentally slow. His remarks were entertaining for only a brief moment. Then it started to hurt. I may just have a short temper, but I found it hard to not yell at my screen whenever he opened his goddamn mouth and spouted his incoherent garbage (it's not that bad, I'm exaggerating). Only when he goes into battle does his speech come off as acceptable, but even then, he's an overconfident prick. Now his gag of a weakness. His sickness on any form of transportation. This annoyed me to a horribly large degree. Why? Just why? Why the fuck would you make something like this his weakness? It's just fucking stupid like the rest of the character.\\n\r\nNot enough for you? Well how about the rest of the characters?\\n\r\nAll the females give off the I'll-lay-you-for-a-dollar-and-then-leave-with-your-wallet vibe. The males are blatantly the huh-you-wanna-fight-huh-punkass-faggot-huh-fight-me-let's-go-bro-fight-me muscle-headed men.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Other than the few brief moments within the first 3 minutes, I felt nothing but pain. It's overly clich\u00e9. Allow me to take a portion of the dialogue from every intense fight scene.\\n\\n\r\nBad Guy: \"Huh? How the hell are you still standing?\"\\n\r\nGood Guy: \"Heh... you really are strong... But do you want to know the difference between me and you?\"\\n\r\nBad Guy: \"...?\"\\n\r\nGood Guy: \"I HAVE FRIENDS\"\\n\r\nBad Guy: \"DEAR GOD NO\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10 - Those 3 minutes along with the art and music really saved it there. Cons aside, this would be a great anime for first-time viewers. I highly recommend it. If you happen to be an \"anime connoisseur\" and you want to pick this up, I say to you: don't. Jokes aside, you really shouldn't decide if you want to watch or not based on my opinion. Disregard all I've and go watch it yourself you priss. I can't do all the work. It's only like 22-24 minutes per episode.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fairy tail is one of those shows that has had a lot of attention on it for along time - both with lots of praise and lots of bashing. Many has some kind of opinion of it,  so what the show really manages to do is provoking emotions - good or bad. I personally has watched all existing episodes (minus some filler arcs, but I come to that later), and are up to date with the manga so I have had time to given it some thought. I gonna be honest, the first time I tried to watch it, I dropped it after 2episodes with the thought to maybe check it out later - it felt pretty childish. When I again picked it up and started giving it a serious shot, Fairy tail  soon started to grow a lot on me until I had given most of my holiday on it. I\u00b4m may be slightly biased in this case, but I are absolutely not blind to the shows flaws - the show is by no means perfect in many ways. But I truly love the show, flaws and all. Yes, it\u00b4s many time childish and over expresses emotions. Yes, many times we get random mood breaking comedy and cliche battle speeches. Yes, most of the power-ups is because of \"I do this for my friends\" kinda of motivations. And you know what? It doesn\u00b4t bother me at all, which is strange because that kind of stuff can easily irritate me. But in Fairy tails case I grow to love the show for it just that instead. It\u00b4s hard to not compare Fairy tail against the other big shounen names out there (Bleach, Naruto, One Piece, DBZ, Hunter x Hunter etc.), but it also should be able to be judged on its own premises. In my review of Fairy tail I have done bit of both - compared it to the big ones and how it stand alone. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nI should first mention that I give the score based on Fairy tail as o whole (anime + manga) and minus the filler arcs. Why? Because i don\u00b4t think the filler arc has the same feeling as the manga based material at all ( I recommend that you skip those), and that all story\u00b4s should be judged when you have most of the whole picture. So, down to business. I actually for the most part really enjoyed the story with it\u00b4s crazy random little inputs, bonding moments and major battles. If you really pay attention to the plot, you will see that the show many times are very well thought throw and detailed. It can be information in what you think was just a random comment/conversation and so on. But all the time you get clues to the major plot and upcoming events. Hiro Mashima has really managed to create a detailed and awesome fantasy world. Even when you think important plot progressions, like the background and function of the dragon slayers, are lost in the sea of events somewhere - don\u00b4t get your hopes down. The story slowly builds up to those moments (yes, sometimes waaay to slow, but hey? Arn\u00b4t we used to that by know?). Yes, sometimes the story seems to go at totally random direction (and can many times do so), but the major plot, battles and mysteries are put out there from the start and links together more and more as the series progresses. The manga is still ongoing and Hiro (the creator of the manga Fairy tail) will be directly involved in the upcoming seasons. What I have seen is many complains about is the many times overused fan-service. It\u00b4s absolutely true - it used a lot. Shore, some serious battles and moments are ruined by it (Hiro you pervert), but it dosent take away the feeling that Fairy tails story and characters are all about (at least not for me). The complexity and details of the Fiore and it\u00b4s history, the guilds and political structures, the use of magic and the different types (you got fire magic, air, water, metal and so on), character relationships, time travelling, magical experiments, dragons and demons, makes Fairy tail to one of the biggest and best adventure story\u00b4s in anime out to date. It has a heavy focus on friendships, believes, loyalty, determination and love. All the things that brings together a strong family and team. If that kind of stuff annoys you, don\u00b4t watch this - Fairy tail is all about that. Sometimes you can have a bit of hard time to feel the characters pain in battles, due to that we see very little blood and deaths in this show. Dirt and bruises yes, but nothing like Ichigo almost bleeding out against Kenpachi. What we do got a lot of instead, is lot of different magic attacks, fist fights and explosions. Some of the magic attacks are really crazy (in a good way), so you can\u00b4t relay on that the strongest fighter will win - some times  it\u00b4s the fighter with most secret attacks and dirty tricks that will come out victorious. Do Fairy tail has an original story? As a base no (strong wizards fighting against all odds, and wins over and over again, friendships trumps over all and that kind of stuff). In it\u00b4s execution? Yes. The world and details of it (magic, history, guilds, inventions and so on) are very original and unique to Fairy tail. Of course some arcs are a bit weaker and sometimes a bit exaggerated border to childish. But then we have some real strong ones (as for example\"Tower of Heaven arc\" and \"Tenrou Island arc\"). As the story progresses the mood of the show and it\u00b4s enemies gets more serious, so it will not stay in it\u00b4s initially childish mode (for most parts any way).   \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art isn\u00b4t that great compared to many other shows. But have in mind that this is a long running show, which has a tighter budget to every episode.  It is how ever produced by to major studios ( A-1 picture and Satelight), which are shown with some really nice settings when money are put in to them, and much of the magic gets time to really shine (for example Natsus fire magic). What they have manage to do, and should get credit for, is that they have stayed true to the manga\u00b4s art. All character has their unique designs and some are just so weird - but it\u00b4s Fairy tails crazy world so I think they fit in perfectly. Some fight scenes are a bit hard to fallow do to some so called \"cut-and-past\" feeling to them, so don\u00b4t expect top class fights as in for example the Fate series. But it also has equally as many detailed and crazy nice fight scenes. Facial expression is very strong and clear, and many times the body movements to. All over I think the art and animation suites it purpose and the show it self.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nHere i\u00b4m getting a bit excited. I absolutely freaking love the soundtrack! The soundtrack is dominated by Irish/Celtic folk influenced rock. It\u00b4s makes a fantastic job of bring out that feeling only Fairy tail can bring out in me. It\u00b4s well composed, well coordinated and right up epic (for example \"Dragon force\" or \"Fairy tails main theme\"). I\u00b4m glad that they decided to stay with it all through all the anime, and just add some new song here so it wouldn\u00b4t get boring. The OP\u00b4s are all very energetic and catchy. They suites the show great and often follows the mood of the arc it used for. All OP\u00b4s  also showcases a lot of clues of what gonna happen in the following episodes, which I thought was brilliant. It peaked my curiosity of what\u00b4s gonna happen next. ED\u00b4s are a bit goofy at the beginning but if you watch them to the end, the showcases a lot of emotional stuff for selected characters. Many random sounds highlighting the comical aspects of the show. For VA, I watched the dubbed, and I actually liked them all. They played their part very well. They manage in most cases to catch the core of the character. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nAlso here I think it\u00b4s one of Fairy tails strongest parts. Like for example Bleach, it has a broad cast of characters, many with unique features and personalities. As for character developments it varies, but what ever you love or hate the character - the character will force some emotions from you. I\u00b4m still a bit awed in the sense of Hiro\u00b4s imagination of creating all of these strong and colorful characters. Our main crew is Natsu, Lucy, Erza and Grey. Of them I think Erza and Gray have the greatest development (both personal wise and in fighting skills). But the charm in Fairy tails characters lays not in a major character development - is\u00b4s in their characteristic personalities. You know there you have them. Natsu gonna get motion sick and run head first in a fight without any strategy, Lucy is gonna end up in small cloths and win by some random luck chance, Erza will hold speeches about the light in ones heart and go berserk in one of her armors, and Grey will say typical cool boy stuff and freeze people up. It\u00b4s what I like about them. The most enjoyable thing with Fairy tails characters is the dynamic between them, and how much team Fairy tail regards each other and innocent life. Some characters are plain weirdos and some are archetypes, but in their own unique design and little role to fill. Most character are being reused in a good manor, to fill other important roles in the story. To follow the Fairy tail crews journeys was nothing but awesome for me. Some canon and still up for discussions relationships are also very heart warming and well matched. You gonna get some strong moments with your favorites, that\u00b4s for shore. Many of the main and supporting cast is also  given well deserved detailed backgrounds and in real time attention.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI had a absolute blast watching this show, and giving the show a 10 despite some obvious flaws in the plot, character developments and in the animation. In it\u00b4s imperfection Fairy tail has so much to it, which brings a unique feeling to it. I call it \"The Fairy tail feeling\". I benched watched all that was out in no time at all, sometimes I even forgot to eat! Total Fairy tail deep dive. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nJust looked on briefly Fairy tail may appear very childish, repetitive and some times even stupid. But if you look down under the surface you soon see a much deeper show, with characters that will be hardly tested and a plot that actually has a direction. You just has to give it the time it takes to evolve. Overall very enjoyably to me. I started to read the manga as soon as the last episode was watched. And of that I can state that the upcoming season is gonna be totally badass - for shore the best so far. It\u00b4s where we gonna get some answers to long asked questions and see what everything else has build up to. \\n\\n\r\n\"The biggest mistake you ever made, was to mess with Fairy tail\" - The Fairy tail Guild members\\n\\n\\n\\n",

All the arc feels really slow and dragged out. The thing that really annoyed me about these arcs were that there is a flashback every single time natsu gets beat up or someone in the fairy tail guild get beat up. And the say Natsu beats the bad guy is really repetitive and boring time to time.\r\nArt(7): I'm tremendously badat art so Im not going to put any description for this part.\\n\\n\r\nSound(10): Fairy Tail's OST and OPs are amazing. It was Phenomenal. Even though the Arc was somewhat boring, the OST helped it bring some hype to it\\n\r\nIf it wasn't for the OST, Fairy tail might have been very boring and repetitive \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(3): The character wasn't great. All the characters seem to be same the whole anime. Erza would be the strong one that beats up Natsu and Gray all the time. Natsu would always be the one to beat the bad guy by giving a speech about friends. Gray would always take his shirt off and fight the bad guys or sometimes be with Juvia and fight. Lucy would be useless sometimes and always becomes the hostage. I could go on forever.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(6): As I said in the beginning, this was my first ever anime so I really enjoyed it. And i rewatched it few times to remember how it felt like. Even thought the charaters and the story wasn't great, for me its part of my childhood and its is enjoyable \\n\\n\r\nSo overall I give it a 7\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my first ever review",

And there's something else the shipping it gets pretty intense within the fandom and some episodes troll the heck out of some ships and others sink them entirely I'm still waiting for the day mine comes true ya know? hehe well I hope this helps you decide to watch this series too I know its given me many laughs and tears. Good luck.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally: \\n\r\nThis anime has been subbed in english.\\n\r\nIt has also been dubbed in english *thumbs up* hope it helps.\\n\r\n(sorry about the others i have no idea I only speak english)",

            "content": "Fairy Tail. It's one of the most popular, long-running battle shounen series out there. Now, you're probably wondering whether or not you should check out this anime... I mean, why else would you be here, reading this? This review will go over all the main points of the series and analyse both its weak and strong points alike, and hopefully help you out in your decision.\r\nThe first thing you should know about Fairy Tail is that the first season is part of a bigger story that continues on in the second season, which ups the total episode count by another 110 -  but there'sno need to worry about any of that. Once you finish that 175th episode, you should be able to judge for yourself whether or not you'll want to continue watching the series.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nI'll be skipping over the synopsis, since it's already at the top of the page. Fairy Tail's story isn't exactly very deep, and it takes some time to get going anywhere. Much like other long-running series, it is split up in multiple shorter story arcs that are all connected together. Each of these story arcs either moves the plot forward or reveals new information about the characters, or both in some cases. One potential problem Fairy Tail has is the issue with repetition, as in each new story arc introducing a new big bad that must be defeated, appearing incredibly powerful at first, but in the end gets defeated, thanks to the good guys all working together and the strong bonds they share. However, if this is what you want from your battle shounen series, then Fairy Tail delivers it in spades.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nI can safely say the characters are one of Fairy Tail's strongest points, and easily make up for the lack of a deep storyline. The large cast of main and side protagonists are all very likeable, each with their own unique quirks, strengths and weaknesses, and the way they all interact with each other is very enjoyable to watch. There is plenty of character development, though some of it moves at a slow pace, and may not be immediately obvious until you look back at older episodes again.\\n\r\nMost of the villains, admittedly, are a little less interesting and are often just bad guys because they are, though some do get their own backstories and a few even turn to the good side later on in the story.\\n\r\nThere are also hints of romance and many cute moments between many of the characters, but none of it really goes anywhere. If you're looking for strong romance, you won't find it here.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art in Fairy Tail is frankly nothing super impressive at a technical level, but it still looks nice and colourful and is overall just easy on the eyes. While the quality of the animation isn't amazing either (which is to be expected from a long-running series like this), it does manage to stay pretty consistent throughout the entirety of its 175 episodes. All in all, it isn't a masterpiece to look at, but at least it doesn't cut corners wherever it can or suffers from huge quality discrepancy between episodes or scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe amazing soundtrack is what got me interested in Fairy Tail in the first place. It's simply perfect and I couldn't wish for anything better. The Irish/Celtic inspired sound in a lot of the tracks really helps set the series apart from the others. The battle music can only be labelled as \"god-tier\", and really gets your adrenaline pumping during the climaxes. Even in the less interesting scenes of the anime, the music helps make it more tolerable to watch.\\n\r\nOther than the soundtrack, all the character's voices are pleasant to listen to as well and sound like you'd expect the characters to sound like. The voices are full of emotion and passion, strengthening the scenes with intense action or sadness even further. While I didn't think the English dub was as good as the Japanese version, it manages to range between tolerable to good, making it a viable choice if you prefer watching it in English.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nIf you've already seen the overall score I gave this anime, it's needless to say I really enjoyed Fairy Tail. Compared to other long-running battle shounens, Fairy Tail is a breath of fresh air, mainly thanks to its strong pacing. Even though the first season is 175 episodes long, there is so much stuff happening, and all of it happens at a reasonable pace. Battles generally don't take more than a single episode to end, with the exception of some of the boss fights, and individual story arcs are usually concluded within 12-26 episodes. The battles, while lacking the depth some other battle shounens may have, are just much more enjoyable to watch because the characters are actually doing something, instead of having to explain every little thing they're doing. Some of the more special techniques will get an explanation, but it's always kept short and to the point.\\n\r\nI also love how light-hearted the series is, thanks to its many comedic moments, but still has plenty serious and emotional scenes as well, and it manages to find a solid balance between all of these elements.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, it's certainly not without its flaws. It does move slow at certain points, and there's one fairly lengthy filler arc that, honestly, wasn't very interesting to watch for the most part. As mentioned before, the animation isn't always the greatest, and sometimes make you wish it just was a little better during some of the big battles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nFairy Tail is a blast to watch and I could easily recommend it to anyone looking for something that involves plenty of light-hearted comedy and explosive combat scenes, accompanied by an amazing soundtrack.",

But suddenly it became painfully repetitive, and instead of giving an answers to allthe questions that were presented in the beginning, they kept adding more and more. More villains, more characters, more unanswered questions. Suddenly they were dealing with alternative realities and time travel, and so many things that were far away from the original plot... and sadly i had to stop watching it all together as i wasn't having fun anymore. \\n\r\nIn my opinion, this constant necessity of adding and adding is what killed this poor anime. It could have been SO much better if they decided to concentrate in only one thing at the time, instead of scattering storylines everywhere. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, the first few arcs of the story are worth watching. I like the four lead characters a bunch, they are very diverse and have likable personalities. \\n\r\nBut if you decided to start watching, keep in mind that it will start getting old somewhere in the way. \\n",

            "content": "After watching the last episode, I decided that I had to review Fairy Tail. I just cannot wait for the sequel.\r\nStory: 6\r\nNow the story for ft isn't anything amazing. There is no one overarching plot throughout the show. Instead we have many story arcs of different lengths. Some can last as little as 5 episodes and others can go on for 20+ episodes. Some of the initial few arcs can be dull, however as the show goes on the arcs become a lot more interesting. \r\nArt: 9\r\nThe art for fairy tail was fantastic. One gets to see all kinds of characters with such vibrant colours.For example we have Erza with her red hair, Lucy with her Blonde hair and Wendy with her Blue hair. It is a joy to see the animation of the characters, and I just loved the artwork. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThis is probably Fairy Tail's strongest point. The soundtrack is amazing. There is an amazing soundtrack for almost every moment in the show. From the action scenes to some of the more sad moments in the show. A majority of the opening and endings are quite fun to listen to. I particularly remember Opening 9 and Ending 6 as being two of my favourites. Almost ever character has their own theme and almost all are quite amazing, my favourite being Mystogan's theme. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nI loved so many of the characters from fairy tail. One gets such a diverse set of characters. We have some mysterious characters, such as Mystogan. Then we have the more brash and arrogant characters such as Laxus. Then we have the more comedic characters such as Natsu. However one of the common traits in all of these characters is their loyalty to one another. This is one of the most important traits in the show. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nFairy Tail was quite enjoyable. There is a perfect mix of comedy with action. The action sequences are quite enjoyable to watch, especially some of the battle scenes in Tenrou and Grand Magic Games.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching Fairy Tail. Some very interesting story arcs along with impressive artwork, amazing soundtracks and some great characters truly make fairy tail a joy to watch.",

            "content": "MUST WATCH ANIME!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET!!\r\nMost shounen anime often have that overly spirited hero protagonist, like Uzumaki Naruto and Monkey D Luffy, and in Fairy Tail its Natsu Dragneel. I must admit though, Fairy Tail had yet to compete with One Piece or Naruto, especially the fillers arc ( some are goods actually :/ ) but the storyline is evolving in each episodes and the characters are epic. Although the ending is rather 'meh' but dont worry because the manga is still on-going so im pretty sure there is season 2 ^^V . well anyway, im not a good writer myself, but this ismy honest opinion on what i think about fairy tail.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 8/10\\n\r\n- Although i'm not pretty sure what's the main purpose of the series since there are a LOT of hints about the series, for example, at the beginning of the episodes, the story mainly focus on Lucy as spotlight character, but then, as the episodes keep on going, the main focus of the story eventually switched from one character to the other, and most of the plot line focus on the four main character : Lucy,Natsu,Gray and Erza. although i admit most of it focus on Lucy and Natsu. Then, there is the story about the guild itself, thus the anime title, Fairy Tail. It's pretty much like any typical shounen anime, Friendship and bond between the members of the guild. THIS BOND IS BASICALLY ONE OF THE MAIN REASON WHY I LOVE FAIRY TAIL. the stories are genuine although some arcs are quite boring, like starry sky ( my least favorite) but there are also some great arcs like daimatou enbu arc, tenroujima island arc and oracion seis arc. I love fighting scenes and Fairy Tail didn't dissappoint me on that. So it's a worth anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9/10\\n\r\n- I love the arts ! Although it's not that kawaii-look kinda art, i dont mind much though. since i care more about the storyline, i didn't really care about the Arts. but i am satisfied anyway.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\r\n-  HANDS DOWN FAIRY TAIL GOT THE MOST AWESOME-EPIC OST OF ALL TIME. FROM THE BATTLE THEME, TO THEIR CHARACTER THEME, OP AND ED AND THE OVERALL SOUNDTRACK IS MIND BLOWING. I LOVE THE RIFFS!! EVERYTIME WHEN THE THEME ARE PLAYED, I AM ALL PUMPED UP AS IF I AM THE MEMBER OF FAIRY TAIL ITSELF!! AND IT FEELS LIKE I WAS THERE INSIDE THE ANIME!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 9/10\\n\r\n- The characters are great!! I personally like Erza Scarlet, she is one of my favorite anime character of all time. I love her personality, and independent nature. Not too mention, most of the characters of Fairy Tail (especially the one in the guild) is well potrayed , and each of them got unique personalities and identities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\r\n- hands down, im fully satisfied. im a big BIG BIG FAN of FT itself.  I read both Manga and watched all the anime episodes and im GUARANTEE that it will NOT dissapoint YOU. It have some flaws, but hey, not anime are perfect. Fairy Tail for sure will get that spirits inside you wanna fight for the guild itself :p\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10/10\\n\r\n- to be honest, I love Fairy Tail more than Naruto ( both 1 and shiipudden) , Bleach and One Piece. I personally like The Soundtrack. ;) and the anime is great too!!\\n\\n\r\n- I hope my review is helpful. I love this series and I hope everyone will do too!!\\n\\n",

            "content": "The year is 2016, and nearly every major Shonen anime/manga is coming to an end. Bleach is done and dusted, Naruto packed up late 2015 and we are not too sure how much life 'the king of Shonen' One Piece has left in it. But at 265 episodes and counting (I am presuming another season has been announced...), Fairy Tail shows no signs of stopping (at least not in the manga!)!\r\nThe show centers around how magic can be used for everybody's personal life, and how select groups make guilds of magicians to take up quests people are too afraid of doing themselves. Ones such guildis Fairy Tail, the strongest of them all. As the show progresses, we are introduced to the wild and wacky characters Fairy Tail has in it's ranks.\\n\\n\r\nThe 'main four' we focus on are Natsu Dragneel, Lucy Heartfillia, Grey Fullbuster and Erza Scarlett. Natsu is the lead man, and a 'dragon slayer magic' user, taught to him by his adopted father Igneal, who is also a dragon. Igneal left Natsu when he was young, and only left him a scarf, which he wears ALL the time! Natsu is inseperable from his pet talking cat, Happy and hates any type of moving transport. His rivalry with Grey is considered one of the all time best anime bromances.\\n\\n\r\nLucy Heartfillia is a new member to Fairy Tail, and a 'celestial' wizard who uses keys to call upon spirits that are embodiments of the 12 gemini star systems. She is a lovely girl, but her try hard, do hard, work hard ethic has put her in the middle of many battles. We are still not too sure whether she has a crush on Natsu or not, but it is heavily implied that the two are quite fond of each other.\\n\\n\r\nGrey Fullbuster AKA that naked man, is an 'ice-make' magic wizard, who can make anything out of ice as long as there is a decent amount of water nearby. Cocky, arrogant, and ready to do what he wants in a heartbeat, Grey also has a soft side for his friends. Juvia Lockster definitely has the hots for him, and is seen gawking at him whenever he takes off his clothes subconsciously (yes, this happens....a lot!).\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, Erza Grey. The fierce knight wizard who can change her armour and swords at a blink of an eye. If your lucking for video game look alikes, both personality wise and look wise, she reminds me of Lightning (Claire Farron) from Final Fantasy XIII. Her atitude gives her a natural leader impression, although most of the guild fear her so much.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many more characters in the show; Juvia Lockster is Grey's creepy water magic stalker, Happy is Natsu's pet talking cat, Elfman, Lissana and Mirajane are magicians that can let spirits take over there body, and then we have Makarov who is a friendly old man...unless he spanks you...\\n\\n\r\nThe first few arcs made me fall asleep though. The fight scenes were good, but the story around them was just so bad. It was like watching Gintama. Not saying that IS bad, but this anime showed more comedy then story in those episodes. In fact, it was not until the Tower of Heaven arc I really got interested in. The later arcs like the Battle for Fairy Tail and the Tenrou Island arcs are even better, and after the time skip we have the best arcs of them all.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-It brings a unique blend of comedy and story, rivalling that of Gintama (a little too close to Gintama...)\\n\r\n-Magic being used in anime is completely unheard of unless it is a magic girl anime. This changed that stereotype.\\n\r\n-One of the 'big four' Shonen anime that are known worldwide to non-anime fans.\\n\r\n-Arcs are very different. You don't know what you are expecting next!\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-The show relies too much on humour as a redundancy plan. They have too much comedy over action, which makes it a Gintama knock-off\\n\r\n-Some of the characters are really bland. I can't stand Gajeel or Loke!\\n\r\n-It is currently unknown when the next season will air...if it will air\\n\\n\r\nStamp of Approval:\\n\r\n -I give each anime I review a stamp of approval. A rated-BAD stamp means I would skip it, rated-Meh means I would watch it only if you have watched my reccomendations below, rated-Shining! means you should stream it to see if you will like it, rated-Golden! means you should buy this no matter what, and if it gets a certified ++ rating, it is one of the best anime I have ever laid my eyes on.\\n\\n\r\nFor Fairy Tail, I am going to give it a Rated-Shining! It is a great anime for Shonen fans, but for those who want a short series your in the wrong place. FT is a great anime, but I would leave it if your not ready for a commitment.\\n\\n\r\nReccomendations:\\n\\n\r\nOne Piece - 'King of Shonen' One Piece! Luffy the pirate takes on the world for his quest to become the Pirate King!\\n\\n\r\nYu-Gi-Oh! - In a time when card games are the next big hobby, a young boy is taken over by the spirit of an ancient Pharaoh to save the life of his Grandfather...and the world!",

This is an all around great anime. The music is epic and it really pushes the emotion of the story. The arcs are what impress me the most. The length of each arc is just right in my opinion. They don't drag it out, plain and simple. Not only that they are well thought out. The characters are stereotypical but the dimensional characters do not drag down the story. Also there back stories are really interestingwhich makes them more interesting. The most important part is the action, though I would not say it is as cool as DBZ's the action does get me pumped up which is what I personally look for in this type of series. So this is a great series and I would recommend marithoning it by arc because waiting every week takes away from the story and emotion.",

            "content": "I understand that some people say this anime is really bad because of the fighting or the continuous useless fights but I enjoyed this anime very much. This anime shows real friendship and hardworking people that I had never had in my life. Fairy Tail practically changed my life of thinking. I agree that sometimes that the fighting parts can get really annoying and you can actually sense what's gonna happen because of the repeating fights. \r\nStory 8- The story was very good since it had all the things I was looking for ex. fights, a bit of love, magic, dragons, fuuny etc. Fairy Tailcan make you laugh a lot. Not only the show and their way of thinking but even the characters can make you laugh out loud. The only thing that wasn't really good was the fact that you can guess what's gonna happen and the fights are really repetitive. Fights repeat the whole time so it gets a bit boring sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9- First few episodes, the art wasn't very good. It wasn't really detailed and it seemed a little bit off but after a few seasons the art has improved over time and became wonderful. I gave it a 9 because of the art in the first few episodes\\n\\n\r\nSound 9- The sound is really good. They have the best battle musics I've ever heard in all the other anime's I had watched. The music encourages you to watch more and it makes much more suspision out of it.( that's all I can say about it)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8- I liked most of the characters but some of the characters are really annoying and I didn't like them. All of them have really special personalities that I personally like but some.... not so much. It's not like it is because of how they look or whatever, it is because their personalities are annoying, selfish, powerless, talkative etc.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8- I personally enjoyed the show very much becuase of the characters, music, arts etc. All episodes gives you curiosity and makes it really enjoyable. Even though people think it's really bad I recommend you to watch this;)\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review may contain Spoilers!\r\nShall we start with the easy stuff; Art & Sound.\r\nWithout saying the best what the Anime has gotten. The themes are quite good and remain in your mind even long after you finished wathing FT. The art is nice - a huge variety of colours are given.\r\nCharacters...\r\nWell, it's neither very good nor very bad at all. There's a plenty of characters I like, such as Jellal, Lyon, Erza or Gray. But on the other hand there's a remarkably amount of People I don't like at all! I'm going to run through both sides and let you know why I like themor not.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the main character, namely: Natsu, Happy, Lucy, Erza and Gray. I'm very particular with this order and soon you will know, why?!\\n\\n\r\nNatsu is one of the worst main protagonists I've ever seen. He's dumb as hell, gets ZERO character development and wins all battles, all the time! Having said that, it seems that he's absolutely the only one, who could fight against the main \"bad\" guy. That's why the entire stories of each arc are so predictable... it's not even funny anymore!\\n\\n\r\nHappy - funny and annoying at the same time - is Natsus little fellow. He keeps pushing Natsu into troubles, helps him out,... yaya, we know what he's actually doing.\\n\\n\r\nLucy, smart and sexy... she has some ups and downs during the anime and I've got the feeling she slightly enjoys getting herself into troubles - Natsu will save her either way. Because of that and the fact she seems not being able to keep herselt out of it, I did ask myself repetitively: Why? Why always Lucy? The \"bad\" guys are, most of the time, looking for her...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, we've got Erza. In my point of view, her past (the time in the Tower & Jellal) is probably one of the better ones in the series even tough we didn't get see how she became so stro ng as she actually is. But she shows personality - the first of the main characters who seriously does. But - let's go down to Business - and she turns into a sword-fighting monster. Still, I like her.\\n\\n\r\nGray was in the first episodes definitely one of the main characters, but as the stories goes on, he seems more and more like a supporting character than anything else. I do enjoy Gray because of how he uses and forms the ice which is he's given element. But it seems the producer \"gave\" him a certain limit and he is not allowed to go further than this limit - that's why he's sort of useless. And as the Serie goes an he turns more and more into a copy of Natsu... sad, but true.\\n\\n\r\nFairy Tail's \"bad\" guys are another disappointing fact - they're bad, because they're bad. Most of the time no reason is given. And most of them haven't gotten any background story anyway. \\n\\n\r\nWell then... the last thing to talk about is the story. It actually had potential - countless times something started very interestingly and turned out to be just \"another arc with another bad guy who wants to rule the world or destroy fairy tail\".\\n\r\nTo close this paragraph I must say I like the fact that after the timeskip they haven't changed at all. Some of them even not their appearance. Yet seven years have passed... *forever young*\\n\r\nThe most ridiculous thing I found was the fact no one, except one supporting character, died - Simon. But they had to deal with enormously dangerous guys (at least they seemed so) and none of them died.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime would have some gread, and even memorable, moments; however, since every arc is so predicable and ends in almost the same way as the previous one did, you can already imagine the upcoming arc although you haven't gotten the slightest idea about what it might be.\\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting thing is that Jellal made it to become one of my favourite characters of all Animes I've watched so far. As I mentioned earlier, I like Erza, Lyon and Gray as well and I do hope they'll get more screen-time and background story.",

            "content": "First off, I disagree with all the people who simply rated this show 1-3 based on the fact that there was not character development after watching 175 episodes... The fact of the matter is that the show got them to watch those episodes, did it not? In that way it succeeded. People don't watch \"okay\" tv shows that go on forever because of their fantastic and visionary story... They watch it because it's enjoyable (which is what this anime is all about).\r\nFairy Tail is a frustratingly inconsistent show. The show sometimes develops fantastic stories, and sometimes the plots are extremely shallow or even nonexistent. Sometimesthere are beautiful character backgrounds or relationship developments, but then sometimes they get thrown away and replaced with very repetitive character interaction. Almost always the pacing of the anime is really good, but I distinctly recall a part around ep. 40 or so when all of a sudden the direction of the anime must have changed or something, because all the dialogue and action felt really slow and disjointed.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, the consistent part of this show is its ability to drag you back and continue watching. Usually the story arcs are very interesting (with a couple key exceptions), and the anime has several key threads running always that develop slowly yet steadily, making you hungry for more information. Even though the theme - of the main characters just being pushed to the limit and getting stronger every time - just occurs over and over again, watching Natsu beat up more and more people doesn't really cease to be enjoyable (at least in my opinion).\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes it all the better is when the story gets good, it really gets good. I particularly remember some really OMG moments as everything that I thought about the show was blown away when it took a turn in a direction I could have never expected.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, I enjoyed how this anime was fine with having fun with itself. Characters sometimes broke the fourth wall, referred to past events with irony, provided plenty of fanservice (at least plenty of female, some male as well), and joked in a very amusing way. It was a very good action-comedy in this sense.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, don't go in looking for perfection. This isn't one of those superbly well thought out animes - if you're looking for that, I'd recommend Steins;gate or Code Geass or FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood, or something along those lines. But Fairy Tail will provide you with hours (and hours and hours) of entertainment, so give it a try!",

And  to be truthful I only kept watching to see of natsu and lucy ever have a relationship but in the end I decided to drop the anime and forget all about it.",

I highly recoment it for anyone ( no matter how old you are )  to wacth it. ( there is a lot of fanservice too ).\\n",

            "content": "Fairy Tail. What to say about it? I for one was pleasantly surprised by this anime. I went into this expecting another stupid harem anime with countless of panty shots, which would have been dreadful. I only sat down to watch this because people kept telling me this was an outstanding anime, where others said it was horrible, so I was really torn whether to give it a chance. And boy am I glad I did.\r\nAt the time I started watching this anime, only 52 episodes (or so) had been released, and I am not lying when I say I marathoned them all in twodays. I was hooked at about episode 4. \\n\\n\r\nEnough chit-chat though. Review time! (Keep in mind this is my first review ever, so bear with me)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nThe story starts out introducing us to the world of Fiore, a peaceful country ruled by magic of all sorts. Within this country, guilds for mages are stationed about, each having their own way of living life along the people without magical powers, by doing jobs to help various people, using their magic. By this point I was thinking this was gonna be a decent anime, no matter which way they turned it. We're introduced to the main characters and their guild, Fairy Tail, and soon they have problems (of different kinds) on their hands. Following their progress through all these problems was an enjoyment I looked forward to every Saturday and I still miss the thrill of seeing some of my favorite characters kick the villain's face in.\\n\\n\r\nWell having me ramble on about every arc's ups and downs, will take forever, so I'll just say; I thoroughly enjoyed the story as it were, and see no reason to complain.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art was a disappointment on my part. There weren't, at any point, a moment where I  thought; \"Wow that is really great animation\", like I've caught myself do in other anime. I gotta say though, I've seen worse then Fairy Tail and I would also say that it's pretty decent in the last couple of episodes. The huge amount of fan-service bothered me a bit, but they had to appeal to the male audience somehow. Plus if you've seen High School of The Dead, it doesn't bother you at all..\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nIf one thing drew me in about Fairy Tail, it would be the soundtrack. The different kinds of music each scene brought had me ripped along with the mood, whether it was an action or an emotional scene. The soundtracks were mostly brought to life by the performance of harmonica, violin and at times piano and electric guitar. The voice actors did a fantastic job portraying the characters. However, I do not recommend watching the dub, as it is one of the worst dubs I have ever seen. (Along the line with One Piece dub) \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThe characters were enjoyable in themselves. different kinds of personalities mixed together to make one big ball of comedy and interactions. Our first main heroine Lucy is what you'd call the \"reasonist\", as she is the most \"sane\" in the group of main characters, and usually keeps them from being too stupid (same kind of role given to Shinpachi from Gintama). Her role in the series is basically the \"damsel in distress\", though she can be tough when she wants to be. I liked her either way.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have our first main male character, Natsu. Natsu is the short tempered, adventurous hero, who we all know and love. Having been a member since childhood, Natsu's the one who introduces both Lucy and the viewers to Fairy Tail and all it's members. In my eyes, Natsu was simply one of the coolest characters on the show, which was his job. He did a good job.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Gray, the polar opposite to Natsu, literally. No really, despite Natsu and Gray's fighting all the time, they are quite similar, though none of them is willing to admit that fact. Same as with Lucy, Gray have a certain role of \"sanity\" in the group, which portrays him as cool and collected (at most times), He is separated from Lucy in that aspect because of his constant fighting and competing with Natsu, and his need to walk around half naked most of the time. So all in all I love this guy XD\\n\\n\r\nErza, our second main female can be summed up in one word; scary. Don't get me wrong, I don't find her particularly scary, but everybody in the anime sure as hell does. Basically one look from her would have Natsu, who's usually not afraid of anything (A trait he shares with Luffy from One Piece), shaking at his knees and obey everything she has to say. None of the other characters are any different in that area. Through her arc though we learn she has a soft side, which made me like her a whole lot better.\\n\\n\r\nThe sub-characters were all enjoyable people, who I also got attached to through the series. I all in all love these characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching Fairy Tail to the fullest, but forgot it rather quickly after it ended. I do still miss a new episode every Saturday, but I cope with watching other animes at the moment. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave Fairy Tail an 8 for it's amazing soundtrack and it's super characters. If there was anything I would have liked there to be, it would have been romance, or at least I think so. I'm really torn on that. On one side, I know I would love there to be some slight romance going on between the characters, but on the other I also know it would steer the anime away from what it really is, which is in fact a Shounen anime. So I settle for it's other amazing qualities.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend you to watch this anime right now and make your own opinion on it. The more people watch it, the more of a chance we have of getting more, since it was never announced that the story of Fairy Tail is over.",
