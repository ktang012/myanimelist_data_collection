            "content": "Vampires have been enjoying quite a renaissance in Western media lately, mainly because of the advent of Twilight. In anime however, tales of bloodsuckers have been pretty constant over the years, but like the West there has been an increase in the number of stories involving the children of the night. The only problem is, they all seem to romanticise vampires by giving them kind, gentle personalities, good looks, a reluctance to drink human blood, or some other hook to make the viewer believe that creatures who look on humans as food can be considered friendly.\r\nAnd then Shiki comes along and blows that whole ideaout of the water.\\n\\n\r\nOriginally a two part horror novel published in 1998 by Ono Fuyumi (which was later reprinted in five parts), Shiki was adapted for manga in 2007 by Fujisaki Ryu. Set during a summertime in the mid 1990s, several people in the small town of Sotoba in rural Japan are afflicted with a strange and incurable wasting disease, and the local doctor fears an epidemic may be starting.\\n\\n\r\nAround the same time a new family moves into the newly built Kanemasa mansion .\\n\\n\r\nShiki may not look the part at first glance, especially because of the colour scheme, but don't be fooled as there is actually quite a deep plot to this series, and while there is a degree of predictability about the storyline, this is balanced some good scripting and a more reasoned narrative approach. One of the things that separates this anime from more recent offerings is that it harks back to older vampire tales, so unlike Fortune Arterial, Rosario + Vampire, and other titles of that ilk, the undead in Shiki are unable to venture out into sunlight, nor are they able to enter a home unless invited, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to this there's an intelligence about the story that materialises in some interesting ways, from the doctor's logical approach to the town's crisis, to the strangely normal reactions of the local women at the beginning of the penultimate episode. Shiki could readily be compared to Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni as it explores certain aspects of human psychosis over the course of the series, and it's pleasing to watch an anime that doesn't assume that the audience are blithering idiots.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that may put people off though, is how everything looks. The town and rural scenery are nicely detailed and varied, but viewers may initially wonder at the incongruity of the bright colours, or even the European styled mansion sitting on a hill overlooking the town. Rather than a whimsical approach to the design, this is a purposeful nod at the stereotypical hilltop \"castle\" that is prominent in a number of  European horror stories.\\n\\n\r\nThis slightly methodical approach to design also manifests itself with the characters as it seems as though there has been an attempt to include just about every body shape into the series. Now while this adds a nice touch of diversity, there are some rather ludicrous additions which seem a bit out of place in a rural setting (one example is Ookawa Tomio, the owner of the liquor store, who looks like he was built in a shipyard). That said, the one glaring issue is that the vampires are easily recognisable because of their eyes, which is a bit of a shame as there are several scenes where the effect would have been heightened if there was less of a difference between the undead and humans.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, the production company Daume isn't really well known in the West, but the work they've put into Shiki bodes well for the future of the studio. The characters generally move well, and while there are some slightly ridiculous body positions and actions at times, there's also a bit more realism about the series since none of the undead can leap over buildings or fly through the air. The action sequences also benefit from this more realistic approach, but there are still a small number of scenes that \"bend\" the laws of physics at the very least.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that does bear mentioning is the quality and impact of the visual effects, especially the colour scheme, partly because of the variety, but mainly because they provide a number of scenes with some much needed emphasis.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, Shiki features some pretty decent acting, and a number of seiyuu really do put effort into their roles, even if they only have a minor speaking part. Now one could argue that this is to be expected from professionals, but sadly this isn't always the case as there are many anime out there that simply haven't understood that a poorly executed supporting role can spoil the performance of the leads.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside is that there are times towards the end of the series where the actors and actresses seem ... a bit too enthusiastic. Fortunately the seiyuu playing the main roles are there to steady things, and their performances are very good indeed.\\n\\n\r\nShiki is well served by a variety of incidental music, ranging from quiet yet slightly ominous music box pieces to haunting choral anthems, all with some slow techno beats thrown into the mix to round everything out. The series has two opening and ending sequences that, in all honesty, are a bit of a mixed bag. The first OP, Kuchizuke by Buck-Tick, is a pretty angry piece that actually fits well with the theme of the show, but sadly the second OP, Calendula Requiem by Kanon x Kanon, doesn't really work as it's a bit too J-pop for its own good. As for the EDs, the first one, Walk no Yakusoku by Nangi, is a slightly bittersweet track that echoes of triumph, and in all honesty it's difficult to judge how fitting the song is with this anime. On the other hand the second ED, Gekka Reijin by Buck-Tick (again), really does work well with Shiki, and the track is reminiscent of the music produced by some of the \"darker\" European rock/pop bands of the 1990s.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the effects, they're suitably gory when the occasion demands, but even poor effects would be raised by the quality of the choreography throughout this series. Everything from the music, including the OPs and EDs, to the pitch and cadence of the speaking roles, is timed very well, and it's clear a great deal of effort has gone into making this anime an aural experience as well as a visual one.\\n\\n\r\nNow one of the things that is clear from the opening sequence is that Shiki has quite a large number of characters. Normally this would mean that much of the developmental aspect of the storyline would focus on the leads, with the supporting characters reinforcing this growth, but Shiki takes a different line, and it's one that will hopefully be seen a lot more in the future. The main strength of this series is characterisation, and from the bit parts on up, every single role is clearly defined. The advantage to this method is that it's not always necessary to develop a well defined character, and Shiki follows this path almost religiously. While some growth does occur over the course of the series, what's most interesting is how each character adjusts and adapts to the events in the town. Probably the best example of this ethos in action is in the latter half of episode 14, and the methodical approach taken by the local doctor Ozaki Toshio is reflective of the fact that there is a degree of logic and intelligence in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty Shiki managed to surprise me. After the recent run of poor horror anime it's pretty obvious that I ventured into the series half expecting more of the same, so when I encountered actual intelligence in the plot, it came as something of a shock. That doesn't mean this anime is perfect though, as aside from the more obvious audio and visual flaws (like not washing off blood), there are several elements in the story that could have been resolved. That said, it's nice to watch a show that sets out to tell a story without assuming that the viewer is afflicted with the moe bug.\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason I like Shiki though, is because it doesn't fall foul of the drivel produced by authors of \"dark romance\", but instead postulates some moral and ethical dilemmas for the viewer to ponder. In addition to this it also highlights the human capacity for adaptation, something which is often overlooked in anime. If you're looking for an intelligent horror, then this series is right up there with the likes of Ghost Hound, Ghost Hunt, and other equally worthy shows.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that this is effectively a throwback to the type of horror that epitomises Bram Stoker's Dracula (without certain supernatural shenanigans), Shiki is something of an oddity in anime as the general trend leans heavily into romanticism and moe, and in all honesty I haven't seen a vampire tale this good since Kurozuka, which says a lot more about the anime industry than I can put into words.",

            "content": "I've seen my fair share of vampire anime; and I have to say, it was under vast number of genres, as well as themes.  Shiki however, pulls you back in to what the traditional myth of vampires; added to it that it's a thriller, it will move anyone who's a vampire fan.\r\nStory: 10\r\nCompared to many other vampire themed animes, such as Blood+, Rosario + Vampire, Vampire Knight, and Trinity blood; this anime comes back to the roots of vampires and their myths.  In this anime a town is plagued with death with no reasonable explanation; though thought of a possible epidemic, Doctor Ozaki,the head doctor of his clinic cannot find any actual symptoms related to any known disease, besides Aplastic Anemia, which is the loss of red and white blood cells. As the body count rises, he becomes desperate to find an answer until he comes up to a conclusion, albeit a far fetched one, that it might be a work of Okiagari, or vampires. His next problem then is to convince the village; of course such a mythical conclusion would \"never\" exist in the rational world.  As he tried desperately to prove the existence of okiagari, death sweeps through the town faster and faster, until soon, more than half of the population has been wiped.  Still they did not believe him. That is until he killed a vampire, named Chizuru, in front of everyone. Then the vampire hunt begins.  There are mini plots within the whole series that I will not divulge, go watch it to see.   At first, the anime's plot progression  might come up as slow to most people.  Even I had a hard time dealing with the first 3 episodes. But it get's really good.  The fact that the anime went back to the original vampire myths alone made me smile, such as that they can not enter a home until they are invited in, or that they die if stabbed with a stake at the heart, and the fact that they are UNDEAD; just including those classic myths already got me hooked.  This anime has definitely gave back the respect of vampires that Twilight has taken away.  And contrast to the other animes I've mentioned, very little gore is shown, at least until the way later episodes, even then, it was there as part of the ambiance, and not for its own sake. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe lines were sharp, and the colors were almost fluorescent. The art of the animation just didn't look like it fits with a subtle setting and plot like that. Not to mention the crazy hairstyles that almost every relevant character had.  It was like watching bakemonogatari but with better details. The animation would be more fit for shounen anime in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe1st season OP got me the first time I heard it.  It was almost celtic, and goes perfectly with the whole theme.  The BGM, it was not intrusive, but yet it'll make you want to jump at times; some even sound like something out of the catholic church, which is awesome due to the ties of religion to vampires;the good thing about it is that they also barely use BGM.  The 2nd season OP for some reason reminded me of one of the OP's of Rozen Maiden, i don't know why, but I didn't like it as much.  The 1st season ED is that like something off a romance anime though, but once you get to the later episodes, you will figure out why.  The 2nd season ED I liked because it was indie/soft rock for me, and it was calm yet eerie, which what the anime was about. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThere were really only 4 main characters in the anime; Sunako, Ozaki, Seishin, and Yuuki.  However, you will definitely be able to tell that EVERYONE is important, even the ones who died, or risen. This is because of the sub-plots, as I mentioned earlier, and they are awesome. However as much as that's a good thing, the downside is that no one really has any room to grow.  The viewer really can't see if there is any character progression. However, that really isn't necessary due to the big-picture nature of the plot. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nLike I said in the Story section, it is at first slow, but as the people die, and the vamipres close in to the main characters, it becomes a classic thriller.  At one point I actually jumped off my seat.  This take on the classic vampire is really something that needed to be done. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nBasically, if you hate twilight, you would love this.  It puts back the vampire's reputation of being mysterious, scary, and are considered \"monsters\".  It went back to the classics of vampire myths, and made it work quite well.  I really do hope that this anime becomes a classic; in case everyone needs to refresh that vampire actually DIE under the sun, and not sparkle like a disco ball. \\n\\n\\n",

I didn't feel any sympathy for either side. So I didn't end up contemplating life. Also I already knew humans are terrible. I guess a reminder didn't hurt? (Concept was good enough for bonus points in story rating. But, mainly, the endless blood showers \u2665)\r\nArt: 3/10\r\nI still remember when my brain just said, \"Deal with it, it's episode 17 already.\" The drawing style is unique but I didn't find it beautiful, it was bizarre. I guess it suits how messed up the animeis but it doesn't change things for me; didn't like it. Bonus points: Managed to live with it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nI actually liked the music and anything sound related, it was the one thing I couldn't complain about. It wasn't painfully out of place or too weird.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nOh wow. In one word, UNLIKEABLE. Most of them were painfully annoying or despicable. Even the kind ones were annoying to me, like that best friend guy that kept crying. I can't explain without spoilers but ask yourself, \"Is it worth ruining my day for?\" Not really. \"Why do that?!\" or \"Just do it!!\" moments are too many a person should ever experience in a single series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10?\\n\r\nI managed to sit through 24 episodes overall so it's compelling in its own way. Who's gonna die next?? Is everyone a piece of *** or will they actually grow as characters?? Tbh, it actually took me a few episodes to understand what was going on so there's some major potential this could have been shorter than it was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\n100% would not rewatch. 6 is actually generous but I base my ratings on concept potential usually. Don't get me wrong, it was compelling enough to keep me interested, BUT, it was compelling in a bad way. I kept watching to see if anyone of those fudgers actually pulls through for me. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: If you like messed up stuff, this could be for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEveryone's review seems to be raving about how good Shiki is and so I'm just wondering maybe there is something wrong with me. (Well, there must be if I managed to get through this bloody anime without losing my appetite but that's another issue.) Why did I bother to write this you may ask?? I think it might be nice for other people to have some closure that they're not abnormal for not raving about it and that it's not for everyone, I'm like Batman of the anime world.

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nHumans have two sides, the animal side which keeps us alive and human side which builds societies, laws, art. This side makes us what we are. Shiki tries to touch this subject. However, Shiki fails to achieve that on so many levels.\r\nShiki has one of most boring starts I have ever seen in anime, first episodes are sluggish and uninteresting. While viewer knows what the hell going on from as early as episode 3, characters in anime simply can't figure it out even with such huge evidence. Every character is god damn idiot. Even these Shiki's are idiotic they don't even tryto hide their presence.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in Shiki are annoying at worst and uninteresting at best. Given the Shiki's premise, it should be a very character driven show. However, characters are the worst part of the show. It seems people working on this had the competition of How can you make each character as unrealistic as possible while making them as annoying as possible? This is unacceptable. It is not like that Shiki didn't have enough episodes, rather than showing how each character is a douchebag, they could have shown the relationship between various characters making climax more heartbreaking. If characters had enough development for me to care about them, then this would have been very good anime, sadly that is not the case. The only likable character for me was Tomio Ookawa, the person who was killing Shiki's left and right and killed his dead son, probably the smartest character too.\\n\\n\r\nShiki liked by many because it shows moral ambiguity, let me debunk that myth. Now imagine that this entire village either died or people turned into Shiki's. These Shiki's still need to feed on other people and when they do, that person either dies or become Shiki. Now this will spread like an epidemic, how long do you think human population will last as more and more people will turn into Shiki's and others die. Shiki population will grow with increasing rate and human population will decrease with increasing rate. Soon there will not be enough humans to feed all Shiki's and hence Shiki's will die out. The conclusion is simple that Shiki's are unnatural as they dig their own grave, either way, they are doom for extinction. There not a single carnivorous in the world which would naturally do that kind of thing. Hence by definition humans have more right to live than Shiki's. Because of slow reproduction of humans, Shiki's will eventually run out of food. This premise is very well handled in Parasyte the maxim. There is no moral ambiguity here.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, Shiki is a mess of stupid characters playing kingdom kingdom.",

            "content": "Shiki had such an awesome premise, however, from my perspective  it fails to do that premise any justice. I will try my best to give a feel for the story, spoiler free of course. The story and artwork just weren't my cup of tea, but I understand some might enjoy this type of story / cast so I will attempt to avoid outright trolling.\r\nSTORY\r\nI was very disappointed in the story for a lot of reasons. It progresses painfully slow, and the character development eventually drops just about everyone in the 'gray area' between good and bad. So basically by the time the climax comesaround you have nobody to root for. You don't care if any of the main characters survive, shiki or human. \\n\\n\r\nART / SOUND\\n\r\nThis is what ruined it for me. I probably would have enjoyed the story more if the art wasn't so ridiculous. The hair on some of the characters...the hair. It's like Super Saiyans on crack. Gravity defiant, logic defying hair that makes the living humans look undead even though they're still alive. The elderly and even some of the young characters (Masao in particular) look hideous right from the start. It's not scary, in my opinion it's just unpleasant to look at. There's not much to say about the Sound. It didn't really leave an impression. The sound effects weren't always used the best way (I.E. Excessive cracking noises coming from a Shiki that is barely moving it's neck)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \\n\r\nA lot of the characters are so incessantly obnoxious to the point where you want them to die. Then they die. Then you realize crap this is Shiki, I have to wait for them to die a second time before I'm through with their BS. Even the characters you like in the beginning betray those good qualities by the middle / end. One more thing, chain smoking doctors aren't cool. You're supposed to be a doctor dammit, save those cigarettes for us non-doctors.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nShiki failed to live up to my expectations. I feel like Shiki never intended to give you a likeable cast. The point of the story is to submerge you in moral ambiguity with a bunch of mediocre characters and slow moving plot. Most likely the goal was to have the viewer ask him or herself in the aftermath of the climax \"What was (morally) good? What was bad? Was anybody really in the right?\". It's left up to the viewer to decide without the anime deciding which side was 'right' for you. Unfortunately, at least in my case, by the time I got to that point I didn't really care enough about the story, the characters, or the ending to think too hard about it.   \\n",

But what first starts as an epidemic, turns out to be much more. The first episodes might be boring.I didn't really enjoy watching them but later the show really getsgood.There is nothing such as an epidemic the reason of the deaths are Okiagari ( Some people might call them vampires ). Dead ones who come back to life. I'm really glad this anime is here. Because I'm sick of the shows who show only romace between humans and vampires. This anime is different. If you miss old school vampire animes,this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art is very abstract and I think the style is unique. Please don't be one of this people who hates Shiki because they say the art is weird. What? They are having interesting hairstyles.Really I never saw so much crazy hairstyles but this is not bad.The art could be better but I like it like it is.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI love the openings! The first opening really fits the anime. To be honest I didn't like it at the beginning but later I just started to love it ! The endings are ok to,but they look like endings of some romance animes. Shiki is just amazing. It has everything !\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThey aren't much main characters but that doesn't mean other are not important. You don't like Shiki because much people die? Well this is a part of this anime and if you give Shiki a chance you will see that everybody is important. The dead ones to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nLike I said the story is amazing. It's just to good to be ignored. If you still didn't choiced to start watching Shiki you're going to miss something. Clannad or Death Note didn't get popular in one day and look at them now ;)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nWhat is the next thing you have to do? :O\\n\r\nRight go and watch Shiki you will make me and every Shiki fan very happy. If you don't like the anime I'm sorry that I wasted your time. But I think it's worth watching.Do you love Twilight and hate vampires who kill and are \"scary\" you won't like this.But if you miss old vampire storys without a vampire and werewolf who are fighting for a girl,vampires who can go outside days and they sparkle -__- and stupid \" I love you \" that is every second sentence in Twilight. Sorry to all Twilight fans but I just want to tell you there is no romance in this anime. Well not that much,but sure there is,so Twilight fans there is something for you to ? ~ :)",

            "content": "Something strange has been going on in the quaint village of Sotoba...  Ever since those wealthy outsiders built their lavish mansion at the top of Kanemasa Hill, there has been a succession of mysterious deaths...  People of all ages will become lethargic and anti-social, refuse to go to the doctor, and then die after only a few days...  Could it be an epidemic?  Some new disease?  And are the rumors true that the dead are still walking around?  \r\nThose newcomers are certainly strange, and Sotoba does have ancient legends about Okomiyagi, or the dead coming back to life...But those are just stories, right?\\n\\n\r\nBased on a series of novels from 1998, Shiki tells the story of an entire rural Japanese community as it deals with one mysterious death after another, slowly whittling their population down as their efforts to explain it...  And hopefully put a stop to it...  yield no results, no answers, and an ever diminishing sense of hope.  It isn\u2019t until a few open-minded individuals start to consider the supernatural that they finally begin to make some real progress...  Unfortunately for them, it\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg.\\n\\n\r\nWith a cast of hundreds like this show has, it\u2019s essential that you set aside a special handful of characters for the audience to follow, so we can explore the story from several different perspectives.  Shiki has this requirement covered, as it gives us three very different pairs of eyes to look through.  First, we have Natsuno, a disgruntled teenaged boy who\u2019s been forced to move into this village with his new wave, idealistic parents.  He despises the village, and refuses to make any long term connections, believing that doing so will make it difficult when they finally move back out.  Of course, despite his best efforts, a close circle of friends do form around him.  In fact, Megumi...  One of the very first people to be killed by the mysterious epidemic...  Had an obsessive one sided crush on him...  and it seems that even death can\u2019t take her away.\\n\\n\r\nOur second leading role is Toshio Ozaki, the director of the primary hospital in Sotoba.  Having taken over the clinic from his deceased father, he\u2019s a driven and tenacious doctor who\u2019s initially baffled by the amount of people inexplicably dying around him, and having come up against a challenge like this, he will stop at nothing to overcome it...  And I mean nothing, as his quest for a solution leads to him experiencing and performing some of the cruelest acts imaginable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd our final lead is Ozaki\u2019s childhood friend, Seishin Muroi, a local priest and a moderately successful author.  His novels tend to be on the poignant side, dealing with subjects like loss, betrayal, and abandonment by God.  This attracts the attention of Sunako, the little daughter of the newcomers, who\u2019s apparently a huge fan of his work.  He forms a connection with her over time, as his pacifist religious beliefs gradually lead him to develop a sense of sympathy for the beings that his best friend Toshio has sworn to destroy.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is made up of smaller roles, the basic types of people you\u2019d expect to see in a tightly-knit little community...  You have business owners, rebellious teenagers, concerned parents, comfortable elders, nurses, teachers, happy go lucky children...  All of whom deal with the growing problem in their own unique ways.  And for such a large cast, the dub is surprisingly on point.  It\u201ds a Funimation effort, but it\u2019s a really odd Funimation effort, where the lead characters are all portrayed by actors that you normally wouldn\u2019t see attached to such high profile roles.  Toshio is played by David Wald, a long time actor who\u2019s somehow stayed completely off of my radar until just now.  I\u2019m going to have to keep an eye out for him in the future, because he rasps and grumbles his way into the jaded, chain smoking doctor as though he was born to play the part.\\n\\n\r\nSeishin Muroi is played by John Burgmeier, a man who rarely ever steps out from the technical side fo a dub for anything other than a bit part...  He directs, he writes, but when he acts, his subdued performances are normally outstanding.  He plays down-trod, broken men as though it were a second language, and his role in Shiki is probably one of his best voice performances since Gunslinger Girl.  Jerry Jewell also does a commendable job on Natsuno Yuuki, and you\u2019ll find pretty much every Funimation voice under the sun sprinkled here and there...  Hell, even Anastasia Munoz gets an appearance...  but the star of this dub has to be Cherami Leigh, who plays the ominous Sunako, who looks very much like she was taken directly from a Katy Towell cartoon.  I wish I could tell you why her performance in this role is so perfect, but to go into detail would mean giving away some serious spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s at least one bad egg in the dub, however, and surprise surprise, it\u2019s Tia Ballard.  Tia plays the role of Megumi Shimizu, a sixteen year old girl who dreams of getting out of her quaint, suffocating home town and going to a college in the big city.  And she will not shut up about it.  I know that in anime, non conformists are often portrayed as loud, disruptive nuisances, and they did a very thorough job of it with this character, but when you combine that archetype with tia\u2019s shrill, screechy voice, she single-handedly renders the first episode almost completely unbearable.  Thankfully, she only really has a strong presence in this episode.  Spoiler...  She dies in it.\\n\\n\r\nNow, when I tell you that this story is about a small group of protagonists struggling to put a stop to the mysterious deaths happening all around them, with ticking clock being their worst enemy, you may think that concept sounds suspiciously familiar.  Well, that\u2019s because you\u2019ve seen this same plot before, as Another and Hell Girl: Two Mirrors have both tried...  And failed miserably...  at making you care about it.  But where those two regrettable shows failed, Shiki succeeds with flying colors.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike Another, Shiki doesn\u2019t make over-the-top, ridiculous spectacles of it\u2019s death scenes, choosing instead to focus on word of mouth and the sad faces of relatives, so that it can liberally float between tragedy and statistic depending on the tone that any given death calls for.  And unlike Hell Girl Two Mirrors, Shiki paces itself, putting just enough time between each death so that it can drain the hope of the viewer, little by little, as it spirals down towards one hell of a catastrophic ending.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that manipulation of hope, Shiki is one of the most well executed horror anime titles that I have seen in a long time.  There\u2019s almost no filler in it\u2019s entire 24 episode run, as every single event that occurs has a distinct purpose, and is placed exactly where it needs to be in the narrative.  The first ten or so episodes are admittedly slow, building up the tension in the village to an almost OCD-like degree.  Very few answers are found here, as tragic death after tragic death drives the residents to either blind paranoia or complacent acceptance of fate.  By the second half, the nature of this menace has been all but revealed to the audience, even as our three main characters slowly come to terms with a truth they know they shouldn\u2019t accept, and with a terrifying threat that comes to face them almost immediately after they come to face it.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a brilliant, gripping story that will have you skipping through the otherwise beautiful openings and closings just so you can catch the next development as quickly as you possibly can.  While you may find yourself hard-pressed to experience any emotional reactions through the majority of the story, as death will inevitably become commonplace in this kind of story, there\u2019s enough disturbing, unsettling material in the final act that will not only horrify you, but will also completely subvert your expectations of a horror story.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I would love to continue to praise this series, and call it one of the most excellent horror titles i\u2019ve ever seen, I can\u2019t.  It\u2019s time to talk about the artwork and animation, and I can already feel my hand reaching out to grab hold of my bottle of Haterade.  Why?  Because this is one butt ugly show.\\n\\n\r\nOkay,. maybe that\u2019s not fair of me...  It\u2019s not the artwork itself that\u2019s bad, as it doesn\u2019t look sloppy or anything.  If anything, the backgrounds and environments are easily on the high end of the scale.  No, what I really have problems with is the art design.  The characters look ridiculous, with angular faces and giant, cartoony eyes, and so many bizarre, gravity defying hairstyles that even a Pokemon animator would say \u201cHey, dial it back a bit!\u201d  No, you know what?  Forget Pokemon.  Looking at Shiki\u2019s character designs is like watching someone from Clamp come up with their own Yugioh Spin-off.  It would be okay if this were some wacky comedy, but it\u2019s not...  Shiki is a mature, poignant show that asks you several profound questions and dares you to come up with your own satisfactory answers.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd if you really want to see this show go from ridiculous to horrifying in the blink of an eye, just wait until one of the characters starts to cry.  These characters don\u2019t cry the way normal anime characters cry...  They cry thick, opaque marbles of liquid that could make a serious claim at being one of the scariest elements of the show.  If you were to take a frame of it out of context, you\u2019d think you were looking at an image from some ill advised Eiken sequel...  And no, I am not even remotely joking about that.  The art design of this show is distracting as hell, and took me out of the story more times than I can count.  And the animation quality  is no prize either...  It\u2019s one of the cheapest looking shows that Bones has ever produced, and if you know Bones, you know how big a claim that is.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of this, Shiki is a very strong anime title that has a lot to offer you...  It\u2019s bold, thought provoking, and without a single hint of pretense.  It succeeds at exploring ideas and concepts that cause other shows to flop face down onto the floor, and if you\u2019re looking for a very broad hint at what these ideas are, one of those floppers is my old arch-nemesis Blood C.  Unfortunately, with an irritating first episode and a constant assault of distracting and sometimes even inappropriate eyesores, you have to put up with a lot of abuse to appreciate this show, so I really can\u2019t see it reaching the level of quality that it deserves to.  It\u2019s still a great show, and I strongly recommend checking it out, but I can\u2019t give it any higher than a 7/10.",

            "content": "Shiki, or Corpse Demon, is effectively the story of a village in the middle of nowhere being subjected to a mysterious string of unexplainable deaths. If you want to watch this anime and go into it 100% spoiler-free, even though this is not much of a spoiler at all, look away now.\r\nThe deaths are, of course, being caused by vampires. While they take their sweet time coming out and saying it, it's pretty obvious from a really early stage. But don't tell any of the characters that, because they don't half take their sweet time working it out. Over half the story is dedicated towatching the cast struggle to grasp something you worked out by the second episode, which is effectively this show's most crippling weakness.\\n\\n\r\nNow stop. Do not hit the \"Not Helpful\" button just yet. Before you have a knee-jerk reaction to this, let me clarify my point quite firmly: No, I do not, by any stretch of the imagination, think that assuming the existence of vampires to be true is a logical conclusion. Not by a long shot. However, there are several very simple logical steps they should have gone through that would have lead them to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe most glaring of these is shown through Shiki's focus on the medical aspects of the show. One of the few things that sets the story apart from every other vampire story is that we see the doctors dealing with all the deaths trying to work out and explain what is going on. This would be a lot more compelling if they didn't miss an obvious sign. They promptly go through every aspect of the deaths, but leave one thing out: every victim shares a pair of bitemarks on their neck. Aside from the symptoms themselves, this is the only thing that every single victim has in common. But the medical staff don't even try to explain it. On top of that, every patient died of severe anaemia, but had no rational way of losing so much blood. Except the bitemarks, the only possible explanation and a plain and simple way of putting the only two loose ends together.\\n\\n\r\nNow, once again, let me clear this up: I do not think that the bitemarks shoudl have instantly made them realise vampires were behind this. But so much about it makes it clear that vampires would have crossed their minds. Even if they initially brushed it off as implausible, they would have thought of it. Instead, this thought takes a long time to occur to anyone, and when it finally does, they are bizarrely accepting of it.\\n\\n\r\nBut even once they do realise it, they have to spend a long, long time convincing everyone else. In troper terms, this effectively leads to the villagers Dying Like Animals from sheer stupidity. Which leads to a highly drawn-out stretch of episodes consisting of Dr. Ozaki trying to stop the villagers from essentially jumping headfirst into their own graves.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, the characters of Shiki are, to put it generously, less than likeable. There is only one personality in the entire series that is simultaneously interesting and does not make you want to punch them in the face, and that is Dr. Ozaki. The remaining cast are either boring, or sociopathic for no apparent reason. There are also a small handful inbetween who are mildly interesting but very stupid. Effectively, this is both the best and worst thing about Shiki. On the one hand, the cast is utterly insufferable. On the other, they die. A lot. And it manages to be gloriously, gloriously cathartic.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also what makes Ozaki such an empathetic character. Ozaki is the only sane man in the entire village. And he is just as frustrated as you are at their complete lack of survival instinct. Also, despite some earlier absences of common sense, Ozaki really manages to pull out some incredibly impressive tactics. And I mean REALLY impressive.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of all the show's failings, in the final act it really gets it together and does a complete 180. This leads to an incredibly impressing finale, that is nothing short of a war. It leads to the point that anyone can (and probably will) die. Sadly this is only for the last 6 episodes, and at this point it is too little, too late. While these episodes were absolutely stellar, they don't quite justify watching the previous 16 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a technical aspect, Shiki ranks to the latter on the scale of good vs OH MY GOD WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!. The art style is about as awful as they come. The hair on the characters is the most stupid I've ever seen. Anime, as a medium, is known for its love of stupid hair, but even among them Shiki manages to be unbelievably appalling. The sound is quite a bit better, being a user of eerie ambient music. The first OP is also quite an excellent song, excellently merged with the animation. The remaining OP/ED themes are fine, but unremarkable.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned earlier that there were three ways that Shiki attempts to stick out from the vampire crowd, the first being the medical aspects. While none of these were very well-executed, they are still interesting: The other two being that the humans vs. vampires war is portrayed as simply being two opposing forces simply trying to survive, rather than good humans vs. evil monsters... and the third, being that they focus on the angst of those forcibly turned into vampires, having to kill people they once knew to survive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shiki has a lot of good ideas but in the end doesn't really execute them every well. It's a mixed bag, with enough upsides to keep it watchable earlier on, and with an excellent finale. Still, it really isn't worth watching in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 5/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: No seriously, what?/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni, Dance in the Vampire Bund.",

            "content": "I was directed to Shiki by a fellow anime fan who, like me, enjoyed more horror based anime. He insisted that Shiki was superior to shows like Another or Higurashi, since it created \"characters you cared about\".\r\nHaving now watched it, I am wondering what he was smoking.\r\nI'll go through each aspect individually. Tharrrrr be spoilers (at least in the plot section), so read at your own risk.\r\nArt = 5\r\nI'm torn on this one. On the one hand, the backgrounds are great. It looks like a small village. They are beautiful, though a bit colourful at times for an anime which is supposed to be \"dark\".Points also go to this one for mixing up the character designs and not having all the characters as beautiful supermodels. Though not excessively gory, the blood and gore aren't skimped on either, another important point.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other, there are big problems with the character designs. Some of the characters look utterly ridiculous. Seriously, what is with their hair? It detracts from the \"horror experience\". The best horror anime have characters who look vaguely like real people, not people who have had their hair styled by Ronald McDonald. Okay, enough about the hair. \\n\\n\r\nAnother nitpick I had about the art was how obvious it was when a character was turned, so to speak. Red eyes, glowing white skin, just unnatural looking. It might have been more interesting if it was hard to tell the two groups apart.\\n\\n\r\nI am pretty forgiving when it comes to art so I can ignore a lot of ugly if the story is decent.\\n\\n\r\nSound = 7\\n\r\nCredit where credit is due here. The majority of the voice acting worked for me. Everyone had a distinct voice and most of them were fitting. I couldn't tell you what any of the minor characters voices sounded like (or if they were \"off\") but that doesn't bother me in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is ... interesting. The openings are fine, for the most part. Ending songs aren't quite as good but still passable. Some of the in-show music works very well, in a creepy subtle way. By that token, there is also some that are too subtle and fail to evoke any mood. And then there's the weird pop-techno blend song that comes in once in a while. Each time I heard it, I spent the entire time trying to figure out what popular song it sounded like.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty good. It works. No real problems here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter = 3\\n\r\nWe start off by sticking close to a pink haired girl named Megumi. She is a stuck-up bitch who hates the town she lives in (and many of the people, including some who go out of their way to be nice) and has an unhealthy obsession with a boy named Yuuki. Think she's the protagonist? Nope.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about Yuuki? He's the outsider who's just moved to a new town and is slowly making friends. Again, not really the main character. We spend a good portion of time with him until about a third of the way in.\\n\\n\r\nThe people we spend most of the time with are the Doctor (Ozai) and the Junior Monk (Seishein). This is a mixed blessing, since Ozai is perhaps the most interesting and likeable character in Shiki. Megumi is, for the most part, annoying as all hell, though she gets better as the series goes on (and her role is downplayed). Yuuki is tolerable but never really breaks out as a character. He's the stoic (semi-)badass who says he doesn't want friends but has a good heart. Seishein is ... horrible. I know I'm supposed to agree with or sympathize with him since we spend a decent chunk of time with him, but he's a drag in every scene he's in. Ozai is perhaps the most logical and realistic of the characters. He realizes something is wrong and he ATTEMPTS TO FIX IT!\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the characters is development. There is a large cast of characters, the majority of which aren't important anyway, which means we don't spend enough time with any character to get too attached to them. And very few of these characters change in any meaningful way. Most of the characters are the exact same whether alive or dead, though the dead do angst a bit. \\n\\n\r\nThe character I had the most sympathy for was the girl in the track suit. She's young, unprepared for this, forced to choose between doing unthinkable things and dealing with friends and family who have risen. Her increasing instability is one of the few interesting changes within the series. Too bad she's downplayed in the second half.\\n\\n\r\nPlot = 3\\n\r\nThere are spoilers now. You have been warned.\\n\\n\r\nShiki is about vampires. If you didn't know that going in, you would have figured it out by the second episode at the latest. \\n\\n\r\nIt takes the rest of the characters at least another three or four episodes to catch up. The plot is sloooooow. Most of the mystery, if there was any to begin with, is dispelled right away. Every once in a while, something interesting would happen and I felt like I wanted to see what was next. Then the plot would drag its feet a few episodes with no substantial progress being made.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up the first 2/3rds of the plot, the vampires are killing people. A lot of people die. Only Doctor Ozai, Seishein and a few kids realize what's going on. Then the kids drop off the face of the earth for a while and barely factor in again (with one exception). Most episodes in this bit focus on Ozai  trying to do something, the townsfolk doing nothing and Seishein being tormented. Should he do something? (YES!!!!)\\n\\n\r\nTo repeat, the vampires kill a good portion of the population and no one is all that disturbed about it. \\n\\n\r\nIn the last 1/3rd, the show does a 180 and tries to make us sympathize with the vampires. This might have worked if they hadn't been mercilessly slaughtering townsfolk for half of the series. There are some moments where you genuinely think the vampires have been dealt a shitty hand (not choosing to become one but being forced by whoever bit them), but they are few and far between. Suddenly, the humans are the bad guys for protecting themselves and their families against the immortal people who have been murdering them.\\n\\n\r\nWhile many of the humans who are cleansing the vampires are obviously enjoying the experience waaaay too much, it's hard to argue that they're wrong in doing it. Should the vampires survive, the humans will just be mined for blood until there are none left. You can complain that the vampires want to live too and they've retained their memories, but the bottom line is that their existence is just to kill former neighbours and friends.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's just moments of incredible stupidity.\\n\r\n-At one point, it's suggested that the Shiki want to convert all the humans they can so the village is entirely Shiki. This would make sense, if you forgot that they NEED the humans for sustenance. Without them, the vampires starve. \\n\r\n-A third to half the town is wiped out and everyone is content to believe it's an epidemic, yet make no effort to do anything about it. \\n\r\n-No one questions why there are now large populations of people who work only at night, why many families have just disappeared and where the death records have went.\\n\r\n-Ozai makes a tape of him dissecting his wife, proving the existence of Shiki .. then shows it to no one. \\n\r\n-If you can figure out Seishein, you deserve a cookie, his entire character and motivations make no sense. \\n\r\n-The technology problem prevalent in horror. Why does no one phone about this? \\n\\n\r\nThe final few episodes make an attempt to tie everything together but it only partly satisfies. Many of the characters motivations are still stupid and there are jumps that we're never shown.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't to say that there isn't ANY depth in Shiki. There is. It just happens to be muddied by other aspects. In the second half of Shiki, we start being presented with questions about the value of life, whether it is ethical to kill (if your life is on the line), the propensity to deny rather than act. The questions are interesting. It's the way they're executed that doesn't do them justice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 4\\n\r\nI wanted to like this series. I really did. And there were some positives. I liked that they used some old-school vampire tropes (not being able to enter buildings without being invited ect). I liked the tracksuit girl. I liked Doctor Ozai, who has a couple of badass moments (though not enough!). \\n\\n\r\nIt's the pacing and the plotting that really let this series down. For every thought-provoking idea (\"is it right to kill someone else so I can live?\") or genuinely nice/interesting moment, there is much more padding. And stupidity. No one (besides a few characters) seem to ever catch onto what's happening before they kick the bucket. Everyone is so complacent that you wonder whether they're all too stupid to live. I was ready to scream at these characters sometimes. DO SOMETHING! \\n\\n\r\nOverall = 5\\n\r\nSee above, really.\\n\\n\r\nShiki has potential, but squanders it by dragging everything out and failing to make any compelling characters.\\n\\n\r\nLook ma, no Twilight references!",

            "content": "Death is terrible for anyone. Young or old, good or evil, it\u2019s all the same. Death is impartial. There is no especially terrible death. That\u2019s why death is so fearsome. Your deeds, your age, your personality, your wealth, your beauty: they are all meaningless in the face of death. \r\n   Shiki is a very hard series to talk about without spoilers. It\u2019s a show that you really need to see for yourself. Still, I consider this to be the best show to have debuted during the past half year, so I\u2019ll at least try to vaguely explain why I consider itsuch an awesome and unique series.\\n\r\nShiki is another one of those series set in a tiny Japanese village that\u2019s set in the middle of nowhere. One thing that immediately stands out is how well it manages to colour that village: even the simplest of residents are given an identity. The entire town has about 1200 residents, and this show manages to make them so life-like that you actually feel like part of the village as the series goes on. It creates a truly excellent backdrop for the series to take place in.\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, Shiki is a horror series. It\u2019s got a really thick atmosphere and most of the time it\u2019s just building up and dragging the viewer within this atmosphere. It\u2019s got plenty of disturbing scenes though, and that\u2019s really where it\u2019s at its best at. Now, there are times at which this show feels like this series is moving a tad slow and that it\u2019s building up a bit too much. But trust me: it all pays off in the end with a fantastic conclusion. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say about it.\\n\r\nThe character designs in this series are\u2026 unique. I admit that they take their time to get used to, but that\u2019s not really a problem considering the charms of the different characters. It\u2019s perhaps not the series with the best characterizations, but they are written really well: when they\u2019re developed, it\u2019s done very boldly. The characters are also incredibly diverse, ranging from teenagers to adults well in their thirties, forties and fifties and that overall makes it into a great and huge cast to watch.\\n\r\nMost of the best episodes of Shiki are located at the end so it takes some perseverance to really get to great parts of the series, but the weak moments are very few and far in between. It\u2019s got a haunting soundtrack and a stunning atmosphere. It\u2019s not something you should watch when you can\u2019t stand gore, but it\u2019s a must-watch for anyone even remotely interested in horror.",

            "content": "If you want vampires done right then this is the show for you.\r\nThe story of Shiki takes place in a rural Japanese village called Sotoba that the only thing the residents do is gossip. New residents called the Kirishiki's moved into town and from then on mysterious deaths occur throughout the town and there are reports of the dead coming back to life. The one that suffers the most because of this is Toshio Ozaki, the doctor of Sotoba, because he wants to know why these mysterious murders have been happening. He later believes that the cause of the deaths are something more supernatural anddecides to investigate. Until he reaches a conclusion that the vampires are the cause of the murder and from there on it's just mass genocide of the vampires where the town decides to eliminate the epidemic and reclaim their town.\\n\\n\r\nThe major problem with this show is the first half. Not gonna lie I almost fell asleep during the first half of the show, but after episode13 then the show gets really good.\\n\\n\r\nShiki has a really disturbing tone. The one soundtrack that plays throughout the show is a little girl sing \"Lalalaaaaa, lalalaaaaa\" while a piano note plays in the background. That just gave me the creeps.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters that I am going to give mention to is Toshio Ozaki because he arguably the best character in this show. Another character is the local priest Seishin Muri who develops a relationship with Sunako Kirishiki and the bond they share is believable. The other character is Natsuno who is one of the few characters who believed early in the series that there were vampires and eventually becomes a jinrou, a vampire that possesses human traits like walking in the sun and eating regular food.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one character that is voiced by Todd Haberkorn that is just so FUCKING annoying. Now he is one of my favorite voice actors, but god dammit is his voice annoying in this show.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said this is a show that does vampires right. It also adds a few layers to modern day vampires like different types of vampires and the process of turning into a vampire. The series starts out slow, but picks up towards the second half. Shiki also towards the end makes you feel really sympathetic towards the vampires because they are suffering not being human. In addition this show has very graphic scenes that I can remember just how grotesque the art and animation was for this show. However, the second half of this show is best part. That's why I'm giving it a 8/10 and give it a recommendation.",

            "content": "\u201cDeath is impartial to everyone, be it the young or old, rich or poor.  Thus death is not particularly tragic.\u201d\r\nShiki is by far the most riveting, suspenseful and thought-provoking series I have seen all year.   Truly a category of its own, it not only contains elements of horror and mystery but also makes you question what truly is considered good or evil?\r\nStory\r\nThe story is set in a small village where a string of unexplainable deaths start to occur.  What is suspected to be an epidemic proves to be something the villagers would never suspect. The main plot and characters are introducedin the first few episodes, while pacing is slow, it provides an important backdrop to the rest of the episodes.  As the story progress, we start to see what is really going on.  What I like most about this series is it\u2019s nack for detail and realism.  Even as some of the characters gradually figure what is going on, there is a vehement disbelief from the villagers in general.  The anime pays tribute to vampires well, but even better it addresses our society\u2019s inability to accept those who are different (be it humans or the supernatural).  In addition, what I think is the highlight of the series has been the last few episodes where the line between good and evil, humans and vampires have been crossed. What defines a \u2018human\u2019, can someone who still feels emotions be considered a \u2018monster\u2019?  Shiki makes us questions that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nWith Shiki\u2019s large cast, it seems likely that characters who don\u2019t get as much screen time to be very shallow and two-dimensional.  However, I didn\u2019t get that feeling in this anime.  Most of the characters have enough background story told to \u2018flesh\u2019 them out.  And they aren\u2019t ridiculous or unbelievable background stories, you could say we all knew these kinds of people at some point in our lives.   I would say the two most intriguing characters are Muroi and Ozaki.  Both carry the great burden of knowing the truth behind the deaths but make completely different decisions in the end.  And many other characters surprise me by fighting against expectations.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork\\n\\n\r\nRich colours, dark lines and detailed shading.  Some of the horror scenes are reminiscent of Higurashi with its emphasis on the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nGothic opening song and melancholic ending. Background music is very appropriate and adds to intensify the scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI literally marathoned 18 episodes non-stop.  It always kept me guessing as to what would happen next.  Shiki is also one of the few animes that has underlying meanings to them, it really made me think about the actions of some characters and what some characters have said (particularly Sunako).  I\u2019m looking forward to watching the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime to anyone who has a fondness for thought-provoking shows.   It\u2019s definitely not comedic, if that is what you\u2019re looking for.  But if you appreciate mysteries, dark themes and some psychological reasoning, then do give Shiki a try.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Now that I've finished the series, I'm dropping the score from a 10 to a 9, simply because the ending wasn't as great as the middle.  Perhaps my expectation were too high for the ending, I just found it wasn't what I expected.  It is also is pretty up in the air, which might suggest a second season.\\n",

            "content": "Alright, this is my first time with a review so bear with me!\r\nStory: 8\r\nShiki did pretty well in this category. It was refreshing to watch a vampire story that didn't make you want to become one. They went back to the old school myths, where vampires can't be killed unless you put a stake through their heart, and they fear things like relics and crosses. They were actually the bad guys. There are already a lot of great romanticized vampire stories out there, so it's really nice to find the opposite.\r\nThe episodes were well paced, and the anime as a whole did a great jobat keeping you on your toes and making you want to watch the next one. It did start out a little slow. The first few episodes were mostly just to give you a perspective on what the villagers were like and how future events would effect them, but at the same time you couldn't really skip them because there were bits and pieces you would need to see in order to understand anything that happened later. Once that was past though, the anime picked up really fast, so much so that I had a hard time waiting to see what was going to happen next. Watching an anime that's like a book you can't put down is a huge plus.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself was a little holey. As someone who likes a little science behind their fiction, I was disappointed that they didn't delve into the facts about why the vampires hated sunlight or what made them rise. But that's a minor mishap. My real problem was that there was no real back story to the Kirishikis at all. The main antagonists in the story were completely left without any context. While they hint at things here and there, you never really know anything about them. Especially Seishirou, and that really bugs me!\\n\\n\r\nI have to applaud them for not being afraid to kill of characters, though. Far too many horror anime are hesitant to actually kill anyone, and sort of beat around the bush, instead. Especially when it comes to prominent characters, or younger ones. That probably sounds harsh, but it's really frustrating when characters just barely make it out alive, by miraculous events, over and over.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThis is where the anime really falls apart. To be fair, the art wasn't truly bad. It was clean and well drawn, and the backgrounds were definitely on a higher scale. The real problem was the style. This especially in the character designs. Almost every character in the show, whether main or just a filler, had the most ridiculous, gravity defying hairstyles. It was annoying to say the least, and incredibly out of place in a horror anime. Even in a comedy, these hairstyles would be considered over the top. The eyes were just as bad. Not only were they too big for most of the character's faces, they were so awkwardly colored. Especially Muroi's, I will never understand why his were so different from everyone else's. The eyes also took away an element of surprise that the show really could have benefited from. If only they hadn't made the vampire's eyes such a dead give away.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was on the crappier side, as well. It seemed to be quickly, and cheaply, thrown together. Many shortcuts were taken. In many scenes the people don't even walk, they just sort of fade in and out across the screen. And there was a lot of still pictures that just slowly zoomed out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the art was way too distracting, and I almost dropped the anime because of it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nI don't normally pay as much attention to this category as the rest. The music sounded okay to me. Nothing I'll be putting in my iTunes, but it worked with the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really brings this category's score down was the dialogue. Now I only watched the dubbed version, so I can't speak for the original Japanese! But Christ, this was terrible. So many of the lines were awkwardly placed, or seemed to be missing a lot of context. And a lot of the characters would say things that completely clashed with their personalities. Again, this could just be because of poor translation, but as an official dub I really think they should have done better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nI was so disappointed with the main characters in this anime. All three of the most important ones had almost the same personality. Distant, a little cold, and angry (at either themselves or just everyone in general). There was no diversity! I know it's a more serious anime, but they should have branched out a little, at least between characters. The amount of generic personalities nearly killed me. Other individuals seemed a little displaced, especially Megumi. I know she was supposed to have an outsider kind of feel to her, but they went a little too far with it, and she seemed like she didn't even belong in the story at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part out of all of it is they never gave you a character you truly got attached to. There was no emotional connection, none of the characters were really likable. Megumi was obnoxious, Natsuno was too reserved for you to even really get to know who he was at all, Dr Ozaki was way too cold, ect ect ect. There was at least one reason to hate every character. I really could care less who died and who survived, and that really took a toll on my experience with this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6?\\n\r\nThat being said, I did still enjoy the series as a whole. Yes, they could have done better in a lot of areas, but I still kept watching regardless of it all. It's got it's own way of making you want to watch it. If not for any reason other than who's gonna die next, will that person rise up, and is everyone kind of evil or will there actually be some character development? I will definitely never re-watch it.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure I'd recommend this anime, though, especially if you're new to it! Don't ruin your first experience with something that's so-so. If you're really looking for an intriguing, gory horror story, go watch something like Mirai Nikki instead.",

            "content": "As with all of my other reviews I decided to write a review about the anime Shiki because I found it to be really enjoyable (so far) and wanted to spread some of the love by hopefully persuading people to try it out for themselves! In my review I will talk about what I find to be good about the show and which aspects could do with some improvement.\r\nStory: 10\r\nI\u2019ve watched a total of 16 out of 22 episodes of the show and have so far loved every single episode of it! Vampires singling out a small remote town and picking off each of the(mostly) unsuspecting residents one by one, the story may seem clich\u00e9d when presented to those who haven\u2019t watched the show, after all vampires are no new occurrence are they? But the vampires featured in this show (referred to as Shiki or moving corpses) are a breath of fresh air to those sick and tired off the angsty, misunderstood veggies vampires rife in today\u2019s media. These vampires return to their original Stoker-esque roots, not being able to go out in sunlight, fearing crosses and not being able to enter a home unless invited making the show far scarier overall than if it were just another cheap imitation of the Twilight saga.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no single main character in this series, every character no matter how minor plays some kind of role in adding to the rich tapestry of the overall story. However the story mostly revolves around the Shiki and those with direct experience with them. The three main protagonists, Natsuno, Akira and Kaori are you three average teenagers until the Shiki strike. Yet they\u2019re forced to grow up pretty sharpish as they start to work out what\u2019s really been going on behind the facade of a supposed epidemic and go about trying to save the blissfully clueless town. That\u2019s about it for character development which is a shame but necessary as if the show were to focus on each and every character it\u2019d never end! \\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to note that everyone in the show\u2019s expendable, even the main characters. This I love as it helps to increase the tension felt by the viewers as their favourite characters are caught in rather sticky situations.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nFrankly, I\u2019m not a fan of the kooky art style. It kinda ruins the overall look of the show to plop crazy looking characters (sometimes with hair bigger than them!) into such beautiful backdrops. But if you\u2019re into art a little bit unique and out of the ordinary you may find you like it! The show has a good range of ugly and beautiful people, making it far more realistic than the average anime which could be considered a positive I suppose! The animation of the show however is superb. It\u2019s hard to describe but it was great to see scenes in which the animators would try to do something a little different to keep things visually exciting!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nAll four of the opening and ending themes are so beautiful it\u2019s almost impossible to say a bad word about them. The second opening is in my opinion the best as it adds puts a beautifully eerie spin on the show capturing it rather nicely. The insert themes are pretty creepy too. They\u2019re not noticeable to the point of annoyance yet you hear enough of them to know when shit\u2019s gonna hit the fan! \\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI\u2019ve immensely enjoyed this show so far. After recovering from an arguably slow start the show keeps getting better and better and the character\u2019s situation becomes increasingly dire. Each episode ends with an edge-of-the-seat cliff-hanger leaving me desperate for yet another episode each and every week. I\u2019d definitely recommend this show to any fan of the horror genre of anime, lovers of the traditional vampire, and haters of Twilight alike. I hope this has helped you a little on your decision of whether or not to watch this show! Bye~!\\n",

            "content": "Based off the light novel written by Fuyumi Ono in 1998. Shiki is not your typical vampire themes, it is a rare breed of an anime. If we discuss vampire in anime, many words that come out. The phrases that often comes out are romance (Rosario to Vampire etc), and action (Hellsing and Trinity Blood) Many vampire anime got mixed up by those set-up while Shiki did a different thing than the others. Shiki throws tons of mystery to the plot, the story itself is more focused to the plot and fewer fillers. The story set-up in Sotoba. A village with large numbers of mysteriousdeaths that never happen before. The villagers didn't know what threat that will come to haunt them. \\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting from this story are they take a different viewpoint of the storyline. It's just so rare to found an anime that does that in the right place.The story has 3 leading roles, with a different point of view. While the pacing is different, The story goes with medium-slow pace, while  the individual elements of mystery discovered one by one. Shiki has a little dull feeling in the early episode , but as the story evolves with mysteries & excitement in the air. My eyes just ask more, and more. The enjoyment shines in the finale. In just the end of 10 seconds of this anime, I saw a cyclone right in front of my eye. \\n\\n\r\nI know that many viewers dislike the art of this anime. It's similar with 90's anime. \\n\r\n But, if you looked deeply, the art really represents the feeling of the story itself. The animation is done well, it represents fear and darkness in the night, and bring bright feeling when the morning in the story comes. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound settings are one of the most brilliant ideas. I'm not talking about quality, I'm talking about how much darkness feeling that spit out from the opening theme. While the ending was decent. The seiyuu did well in bringing such characters to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nWith millions of peoples within Shiki, it's really dangerous for the balance of the story. While other people think Shiki need do more development in their character, and they do have.. But, if we think logically, \"How can we make a deep character in just 22 episodes, while the cast is crowded?'', even the best writer will be confused with this kind of question. But Shiki answers that ''We just need the major development in the essential characters, and throw a proper role to the rest...\". The characters  had their own proper roles, it's not perfect but it's enough to balance the story up.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's all about Shiki, a rare breed vampire theme. The anime do more to the plot although have some lack of points in the characterization, but it's worth to watch. If you seek a deep character, you won't get a bonus. But, if you interested to see a serious plot with a real vampire in the anime form, then the anime is for you.",

            "content": "As the Sun sets below the mountain peaks, the rural village is masked completely in an inescapable darkness. Silent. Untouched. Tranquil.  Unknown to them, the horrors that lurk outside, the villagers sleep on in blissful ignorance, as the creatures of the night gather in the confines of the woods. Darkness is broken; tranquilly smashed, to the sudden crimson red glow of eyes, illuminating the area with the red allure of blood. The Shiki have arrived for their next meal...\r\nHorror and anime are rarely synonymous with one another, and, despite the medium barely producing anything horror related to begin with, the few horror titles thatare out there don't exactly evoke fear in me. They either become unintentional comedies, such as in the case of Another, a show that took itself way too seriously, featuring the plot of a B-movie, while I laughed my ass off at every single stupid plot revelation and death (as I type these words, I feel more like a sociopath since I keep repeating the scene of the girl falling down a flight of stairs unto an umbrella, with it piercing her throat, as I chuckle to myself in amusement), or the character designs for the show are too distracting for me to take seriously and end up ruining the horror elements, such as in the Higurashi series. The only anime that has ever actually lulled me into a state of fear is Shiki, a show way back from 2010, and is one of the few vampire-esque anime I can think of that doesn't use their vampires for yaoi fanservice (although to be fair, Shiki does feature some hella pretty boys!) However, while excelling in the audio-visual department to create a genuinely creepy atmosphere, Shiki's narrative is less than stellar unfortunately, reducing it more so from a show with themes about morality in regards to the idea of survival and human instinct, to instead that of a campy B-movie, with a finale that is an absolute bloodbath, reminiscent of the level of gore found in 90s OVAs! Anyway, I've talked for too long now. Let's grab our stakes, our torches, and slaughter some Shiki! \\n\\n\r\nDuring a particularly hot summer in a rural, isolated village in Japan, a young, 15-year-old girl dreams of a glamorous life in the city, free from the hardships that come from living in the countryside, until she mysteriously dies, causing a stir in the once quiet community. This subsequently triggers a series of mysterious deaths within the village, which just so happens to coincide with the arrival of a new family by the name of the Kirishikis (no surprise, that, from their name, this family are indeed the \"Shiki\", the family of vampires who have been indulging in the blood of the villagers). As this unknown epidemic begins to take more and more lives, the town's doctor slowly loses his own humanity in order to solve this mystery, and to discover the true intent behind the new family's arrival! \\n\\n\r\nOne can divide Shiki's narrative into three main arcs. The first arc in which the villagers attempt to learn what this epidemic actually is, and what is causing all of this death, mainly serving to slowly build tension and atmosphere, the second arc in which we see the Shiki transforming other people into vampires (or killing them, as the viewer learns that when bitten, some turn into Shiki themselves, or just simply die), and the battle between the humans and Shiki for survival right at the very end. While this concept does sound good paper, it's execution leaves a lot to be desired. \\n\\n\r\nFor starters, Shiki's pacing, especially at the beginning, is rather slow and tiresome, although the slow pacing can perhaps be argued as a positive element as it helps to build narrative tension, resulting in a rather fun payoff, and helps to create more mystery surrounding the Shiki themselves. Not only that, but the setting of the narrative complements this idea. Since it is set in a rural village, deep into the mountains, it creates a feeling of paranoia and isolation, which only grows more and more as the episodes go along, so the pacing is important in establishing atmosphere. However, the slower nature of the show always came across as more aggravating to me, than anything else, since many of the characters are stupid beyond belief! While the villagers originally believed that the cause of these deaths was that of Mosquito bites, it takes them a rather long time to figure out that Mostiquto bites do not come in pairs, nor are their bites always at the same distance from one another. Of course, I'm not expecting them to jump to the conclusion immediately that vampires are indeed behind this, since that seems rather far-fetched and silly to assume in reality, but the amount of time they spend on the Mosquito bite theory is truly annoying, since, we, as an audience, already know what is happening and just want the plot to actually go somewhere. The narrative attempts to try and hide the fact that the Shiki are vampires and slowly stretches out the answer, which, not only ruins any chance people may have of possibly re-watching the series since the revelation is so obvious, but it can also be rather tedious to watch. Hell, Stevie Wonder could have figured it out before these guys could!\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem the narrative faces is the sheer amount of characters introduced, and the lack of much time to flesh out anybody, making it hard to remember who is who. That's not to say that there aren't some decent characters, however. Take, for example, the doctor who I mentioned before, Ozaki, who is the only character actively trying to discover the secrets plaguing his village! Ozaki's transition of losing his humanity for the survival of the villagers is easily one of the most interesting parts of the show. We see him slowly transform from man to monster and this is handled well enough to never feel forced; the transition feels natural and well-paced taking its time throughout the duration of the early parts of the series as we see this man become more and more obsessed with finding the truth. As such, it makes for an interesting character study of a man's internal turmoils regarding ethics and survival. Another somewhat interesting character is the leader, so to speak, of the Shiki, a young girl (only in appearance mind you!) called Sunako, whose back-story was actually pretty interesting and was enough to somewhat justify why she acts the way she does, which helped me greatly in being able to sympathise with her and her struggles. Her character allows the viewer to understand the Shiki and their way of life, as well as the inherent hardships that come along with it. She brings attention the idea that the Shiki have no choice but to kill the humans for their survival otherwise risk being killed themselves, bringing forth interesting ideas about how ethics and morality change dependent on the context in which one views it from. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast, however, were just really unlikable, and I honestly didn't care if most of the cast survived or died. The worst example is a girl called Megumi, who I mentioned at the very start of the review, and was the first person to \"die\". I put die in inverted commas, because, even though she did technically die, she came back as a Shiki. While the other characters who do come back as such are played out in a tragic way, represented more so as victims of circumstance, and while Megumi falls under this to a certain extent, she takes active pleasure and delight in killing the humans with very little justification as to why she would do this, aside from, perhaps, because she had a crush on a guy who paid her no attention, as we are told in the fourth episode of the show. By the time she inevitably kicks the bucket, the show tries to convey it as a tragedy and expects us to feel sorry for this twat, which doesn't work since she had been such a horrible person the entire time. It's this sudden juxtaposition in victimisation that rubs me the wrong way and is present a lot in the show. Every time a character in Shiki does die, they expect me to be sad, through the use of victimising them, instead of actually building up a character I can care for; it feels more cheap and lazy if anything else. \\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to care about the tragedy in the narrative since most characters acted like idiots, and got what they deserved, with the humans killing their reborn loved ones, without any remorse or sympathy. The show tries to convey the idea of who the real monsters in the show actually are: the humans or the Shiki themselves, but since each bunch of characters are so unlikable, I didn't give a damn really. In order for this tragic story to work, we needed to have characters in which the audience could care about as actual people, instead of the cheap victimisation the show utilises to try and manipulate us into feeling something for these cardboard cut-outs.  That's not to say that the show is completely devoid of emotion, however, since it is effective in one or two places. One such example is in the first episode of the Shiki OVA, but the scene was mostly enhanced by the music and voice acting than the actual writing itself. It's not as bad as some of the other moments in the show, like Megumi's final scene which uses cheap writing, since, in the OVA scene, Nao's character, a human turned Shiki, is given time for one to learn about her ordeals and regrets at being a Shiki, while being tormented by those in which she has killed out her hunger, which actually results in a very emotional moment. If the show had more scenes like this, it would have improved the overall.\\n\\n\r\nAs a spectacle, however, Shiki is entertaining as hell! The bloodbath at the end of the series is extremely entertaining to watch unfold and is pure blood-shed, fan-service in its purest form! Not only that, but the music and the atmosphere this show evokes is fantastic! Each track is eerily creepy or heart-wrenchingly sad, enhancing each scene wonderfully. My favourite tracks being \"Day and Night\", \"SHI-KI\" and \"Requiem\". The two openings end endings are also of a pretty high quality, with both openings representing their respective story arcs very well. As a fan of horror, Shiki was a treat to watch, and there were many scenes in the early parts of the series that were handled with a lot of care and made me feel genuinely frightened. The best example of such is the ending scene of episode four, where we see Megumi, now a Shiki, stalk her crush, one of the other main characters by the name of Yuuki,  who is staying over at his friend's house. The scene builds tension perfectly, and, after both we and Yuuki let our guard down as we believe we are safe from Megumi, she appears from underneath the bed, sliding and twisting her body; the sounds of bones and joints clicking into place, her cold crimson red eyes staring directly at both us, and Yuki. Everything about the scene is intensely disturbing and creepy and has stayed as a vivid image in my subconscious for years to come, and there are many other scenes like this too! Visually, Shiki is consistent but also pretty bizarre in terms of its character designs, with each character having insanely strange hairdos; it feels pretty gothic-like, which is something I can always dig; it's like a romanticised version of Bram Stocker's classic novel. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it, Shiki is a fun show to watch due to the sheer amount of blood and death, while genuinely creating a horrific atmosphere all the while featuring an amazing original soundtrack. However, the script falters in many areas, unfortunately, and aside from maybe two or three characters, I didn't care for the rest of the cast at all. It's one of those shows you watch for the spectacle of it alone, rather than a well-written narrative or developed characters, and I certainly believe Shiki achieves its goal on that end. While its use of victimisation to make the audience feel for a character that hasn't been built up is not as bad as other shows I have talked about before, such as Elfen Lied, it does feel somewhat lazy and cheap to do so, but, despite all that, I still had fun watching the show, and I believe that's important. Shiki, to me at least, was fun! It's shlocky, sure, but watching Shiki, especially for the final third, is an incredibly enjoyable time, and for that, I'd recommend giving the show a shot!",

            "content": "*This review contains spoilers*\r\n'Shiki (Corpse Demons)' tells the story of vampire invasion (who call themselves Shiki) in a remote rural village, and the struggles of select residents in their resistance in the advent of the mysterious new threat.\r\nThe story is told through perspectives of quite a few main characters in this show. We follow the unfolding of events mostly through Yuuki Natsuno, Ozaki Toshio, and Muroi Seishin, but none of them particularly stood out as the protagonist, and all probably had screen times of less than 10%. It's a shame, really, since the story involves abundance of mystery, and leaves so much to our imaginationwithout having an individual to empathize with, we're not put in any character's shoes and think with the given information. The number of supporting cast is massive. It's understandable that numerous victims are needed to tell this story, but do we really need to know about their lives in so much detail in 22-episode series? It gets extremely confusing when you try to remember all their names, occupations, character relations etc as they are introduced via built-in subtitles one after another. Similarly, there was no need to show the actual dates, especially the rokuyou (six-day week for superstitious fortune) when there seemed to be no correlation between day of week and the murders (or anything else). The information overload makes it impossible to keep track of the dates anyway.\\n\\n\r\nConfusing and flawed as it was, the first half of the story was extremely gripping with excellent pacing and suspenseful, haunting images of innocent villagers being ravaged by evil Shiki. There was an abrupt change in direction when enough villagers were converted into Shiki. They were shown with a sympathetic tone because they retain the human memory and need to drink human blood to survive... what? Yeah, that makes no sense. So here we are, after about five hours of cold-blooded, merciless murders and planning for a countermeasure against them, we're suddenly supposed to feel sorry for them? Presentation aside, the logic is flawed since that would mean human beings also have the right to survive by stopping other species that pose as threats. 'Shiki' was filled with plot holes throughout the series from odd character motivations and behaviors:\\n\\n\r\n- Shiki's plan of taking over the village makes no sense to begin with. What would they eat if the entire population turned into Shiki? The logical approach to handling okiagari should be immediate elimination rather than assistance to maintain sustainable food supply and reduce the risk of discovery.\\n\r\n- Why does none of the underling Shiki just hop on a bus and skip town rather than being a slave to their pointless cause against their will? They talk about how Shiki need a safe place to stay during daytime so they can't leave village, but all they need to do is find a random house and bite everyone inside for mind control.\\n\r\n- Yuuki Natsuno's father took down all the crosses and charms because he didn't believe in superstition, Natsuno just gives up? His life was very much at stake, he wouldn't even plead for reason or at least try putting them up again and hope his father wouldn't find out?\\n\r\n- Ozaki Toshio, the village doctor who was willing to violate all the medical codes of ethics to record the video of experiments on his wife, who turned into Shiki. That was the end game, a conclusive evidence that can prove Shiki, not a pandemic that caused the deaths. He could've sent the copies to the SDF, the police, TV stations, weekly magazine publishers, medical research centers, and pharmaceutical companies, and at least one of them would've taken the bait and investigate. To keep the plot going, he did absolutely nothing with it, he even had the chance to show it to the guys at the bar, but just gives up after he finds out they're unwilling to believe... I'm sure a video footage of a woman instantly healing from incision, and being injected with pesticide would've changed their minds. Isn't that why he recorded the whole thing in the first place?\\n\r\n- Then we have Seishin Muroi. This guy is such a joke. He refuses to help the doctor hunt down Shiki because tired of seeing people getting hurt, yet goes to assist the mutant specie born for murder? He preaches how no one death is more tragic than another... how does that justify the death of his family and the thousands Sunako will directly or indirectly kill in the future when he prevents villagers from killing her? What a hypocrite, he even kills the liquor store guy with his own hands. ??? Please get out of the way or kill yourself if you're tired of seeing deaths, don't become a menace to mankind. He must have been mentally ill.\\n\\n\r\nPeople do make momentary poor judgements in real life, and that's shown well in the series where a guy says hi to Megumi, and then realizes she should've been dead already and gets bitten, or when Natsuno's father lets a school girl (what was her deal anyway? She pretty much disappeared after that) in, and instantly felt like he's made a grave mistake. It shows how dangerous Shiki were, and a moment of carelessness can lead to deadly consequences. Unfortunately, there are all these people acting against their motivation for a prolonged period of time. These people are usually either retarded or suffering from mental illnesses in real life. When a story contains many sane characters behaving this way, it's poor storywriting.\\n\\n\r\nThe last quarter of the series is where the producers give up and spit in our faces. From the direction of the story, it was apparent that the Shiki would eventually become the hunted, and sure enough, as soon as their existence became known, all hell breaks loose, and the slaughter of Shiki begins. It gets so violent, it's comical... bloody rice ball break after smashing vampire hearts, anyone? Now all the Shiki need to die in the most horrible ways possible, by people who were closest to them before. Never mind the fact that Megumi was on foot, she needs to cross the highway in the most heavily guarded section into an ambush. Masao couldn't find a safe place to hide, about to pass out in the river bank, and talks about how Megumi would've survived if she was with him (??? she would've been dying with him?). Apparently turning into Shiki retains their memory, but reduces their IQ to a single digit. How do we kill the werewolves? Natsuno pulls out a dynamite (lol?) and takes down another with him. We can't let Sunako die. Let's expect the audience to feel sorry for a vampire who already lived over 200 years without aging and killed thousands... This alone ruined the Shiki's enigma and monstrosity built up in the first half.\\n\\n\r\n'Shiki' does question us with many philosophical and ethical dilemmas, such the value of one life over another, survival by sacrificing other lives, various morality issues, denial of the inconceivable, leaving problems for others to solve, and human being being more inhumane than monsters in times of panic. Unfortunately, all these arguments are very common in anime and other forms of storytelling, and the lazy storywriting made it impossible to take it seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this series is horrible beyond comprehension. The easiest yet the most crucial aspect of the visuals is to conform with the story. This is clearly a mystery/horror/gore series, yet the guys seem like they're princes taken out of a shoujo romance, and girls taken out of ecchi slapstick harem. They don't even match the premise of a small rural town. Sure, Yuuki Natsuno, Shimizu Megumi, and the vampires should seem out of place due to their backgrounds and personality, but you're doing it wrong when nobody seems to belong to the village. Then you have ridiculous hair designs like girl's hair bending in impossible directions and guy's looking like Medusa, Tatsumi's nekomimi, Masao looking like a transvestite, and Atsushi looking like Kinnikuman. Just what were they trying to do? I admit the level of background detail, direction, and camera movement/angle, surreality of Shiki in early episodes were done extremely well, but you can't just pack the visuals with fancy technicals, then completely botch the fundamentals. The art in this series is by far the worst I've seen this season. It's weird, but not outrageous enough to seem like an original style, the character proportions are off, in addition being poor fit with the story, premise, and even the background art. Everything just seemed off.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds were the only positive thing about this series. Yuuki Aoi was incredible as Kirishiki Sunako with the soft-spoken creepiness, but at the same time emotional when needed. Tomatsu Haruka performed very well as Shimizu Megumi as well. The unique voice of Gackt was wasted on a character who barely appeared. Everyone else mostly sounded like they should.\\n\r\nBGM really builds up the suspense, and flows pretty well with the story.\\n\r\nOP1 had extremely high audio-visual synchronization with the animation flowing perfectly with the sound. OP2 was a really catchy song that had extremely high lyric-visual/story relevance, with animation or an aspect of the story matching every single verse sang. ED1 did not really fit the series, and ED2 was an average rock song.\\n\\n\r\n'Shiki' is the first series I've seen since 'Higurashi no Naku Koro ni' that really sends chills down my spine with the creepy, surreal images and violence that didn't hold anything back. Shiki as orthodox vampires with all the classical characteristics were also a nice change. I really wanted to enjoy this series, but the second half was so poorly written and rushed, that I could no longer keep my minds off the obvious plot holes. The story development leaves a lot to our imagination, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it gets annoying when they start using it to justify lazy storywriting.",

            "content": "A little girl stumbles through the woods, her path lit by encroaching flames, her merciless pursuers intending to serve as both judge and executioner. She is fully aware of her own guilt but she runs just the same. The temple offers no divine intervention to atone for her sins, nor sanctuary from impending judgment. The very walls themselves are not safe from the inferno.\r\nShiki is the story of the inhabitants of a small town struggling to withstand ruin, both of body and soul. It does not portray an idyllic village only shattered by the arrival of the shiki (more commonly known as vampires), but anormal town with as many members already possessed of such human qualities as jealousy, snobbery, resentment, rejection, and the tendency to gossip as those of kindness and decency. The extraordinary circumstances simply draw out what these people are already made of.\\n\\n\r\nThe metamorphosis of this town begs the question, What would have happened had all this horror never come to pass? Would the members of this village have led peaceful, fulfilling lives despite their ordinary faults? Probably very few of them would have known that their neighbor, their husband, their daughter, or even they themselves might be capable of such horrors. They would have gone on loving, hating, hurting, and forgiving each other trivial matters throughout their day-to-day lives without ever knowing what monsters might lurk beneath their skin. The slow infiltration of the Shiki within their society puts each one to the test in its own way, though the paths of some, as is the case with fickle reality, are easier than others.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a difficult task in any story to cause the audience to sympathize with the antagonistic side of the conflict. Any attempt to do so can easily come across as a shallow, saccharine effort to defend horrendous acts on account of special circumstances or tragedy, usually on the part of writers who have doubtless never experienced such horrors. However, Shiki manages to tell its story impartially by refusing to choose a specific lead to serve as a moral compass for the series, instead portraying each character\u2019s motivation, choice, and action from its owner\u2019s perspective, with all their convolution and next to none purely innocent. Shiki does not tell you how to feel, and there is no hero from whose reactions the audience can take its cue. It demonstrates any moral questions it might pose rather than asking them in some cryptic dialogue, and no attempt is made to fully answer.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, for all its impartiality, Shiki is anything but dispassionate. Never forgetting or neglecting any character\u2019s pity or horror inducing moments, each one is given weight suitable to its level of grotesque and tragedy. This is aided by the soulful orchestral themes of the series. Although there are really only one or two of these that play throughout the soundtrack, each version is varied in its tone and level of passion. There are moments in which the main theme is played in such a way that it emulates a music box, speaking of lost innocence and childhood. \\n\\n\r\nBeing a horror story, Shiki has its share of graphic images and creepy moments, often accompanied by a chilling, wordless vocal solo, but it moves slowly enough to allow you to grasp what you are seeing, perhaps too fully, causing dismay more effectively and subtly than jump scares. However, it is the circumstances of such horrors that bring about more distress than the actual images or creepiness itself. Family members and friends pitted against each other and the seemingly most kindhearted of people driven to heinous acts lend far more power to the bared fangs, voided eyes, and bloody stakes than these things innately possess. Furthermore, Shiki refrains from excessive or gaudy displays of gore, with hardly any to speak of until the final episodes of the series, by which time it has earned its right to the ensuing bloodbath.\\n\\n\r\nNot only this, but Shiki has a bit of fun with its horror elements. Although the show takes itself seriously, it does dabble in the impish, especially in certain pieces of the soundtrack, which have a devilish pleasure and beat. Not all evil acts are committed in sobriety or shame, and certain characters often crack a smile or take a caper when circumstances allow. Although one such character is portrayed with almost cartoony selfishness, this tone is generally used in moderation and is effective in dispelling a bit of the series\u2019 heavy tone at proper moments.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the series sports creative and somewhat goofy character designs. Their hair stands up stiffly in completely unnatural shapes, retaining its rigid form for the most part even as it blows in the wind. The humans\u2019 eyes give a weird and sinister impression with a ring of lighter color between the pupil and an outer circle of darkness, emulating those of the Shiki, which are black but for a thin red line surrounding the center. This coupled with their crazy hairdos and overly angular faces adds to the overall otherworldliness and creepiness of the series.\\n\\n\r\nShiki is incredibly slow-moving, with the advance of calamity gradual. During the first seven episodes, the characters are oblivious to what is obvious to the audience. As frustrating as this might seem, it is realistic in that no ordinary person would accept the possibility of the existence of vampires without plenty of plausible proof. And even once some have accepted this reality, it would take a great deal to convince others, and so many things must be done and tried before any counterattack can be made.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, throughout all this realistic delay, the series never loses focus. While many anime tend to lose their way toward the ending, often with the introduction of some new element that causes the conclusion to feel disconnected from the start, this is not the case with Shiki. Each slow and detailed episode that came before provides support for the finale, which more than delivers as every character, forced to face the choices they have made, grapples with their fate.",

            "content": "Until maybe a decade ago vampire stories were at their prime. I, as well, used to be a big fan of such stories. In my eyes, those tales were thrilling, grasping me the whole way through and leaving me mostly utterly terrified. After hundreds of movies, books and tv series based on the vampire myth,though, vampires started to lose their original shine. They were just so overused that one could easily stop caring anymore. If anyone of you came asking me what I believed a vampire was I\u2019m not quite sure of what my answer would be. Can they die from sunlight or do theyglitter like the sun? Are they really fearsome or do they look like they just came out of a beauty pageant? Questions like these, that many of you might have, at one point, thought, made me stop watching about vampires whatsoever. And then came Shiki, taking the vampire story onto a whole new level, returning them back to their former days of glory.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nI think the true success of Shiki\u2019s story is the fact that this time such a tale was told through the eyes of Japanese creators, making it effective in two particular ways. First, it was a fresh approach of a legend that belonged to different cultures than theirs, so that automatically helped the creators move off the beaten track. And then comes the slight mix with their own traditional myths of the \u201cOkiagari\u201d, which literally means the Risen. \\n\r\nVampires in this show are just as they should be, afraid of light, can\u2019t come out in the day without burning themselves, they don\u2019t like holly water, charms and crosses, they drink the blood of their victims after completely hypnotizing them and they don\u2019t fall in love with them..*ahem*\\n\r\nThey also can\u2019t enter a house uninvited. Then again, they have everything that a traditional vampire would be proud of, in addition to the so well know wooden stick killing method, that in contrary they so much loathe.\\n\\n\r\nThe myth of the undead, blood thirsty killers, this time, unfolds in a quiet, isolated village and at first look, common village, were sudden disappearances start to occur after a strange family moves in to the big mansion on the mountain. A few people are becoming aware of something out of the usual going on and that is how it all starts moving.\\n\r\nAt first the story runs slow, just as the unaware victims continue to carry on their daily lives. So the pacing of the first part of the series might throw some of the viewers off, especially those who are fans of full time action. Well, how I saw things, this choice of pacing was indeed a clever one, not throwing the viewer into the middle of an already unfolded story, but slowly and steadily shroud him into its mystery. As it rolls, you will find yourself entangled in it, with questions that you just need to find the answers for, doubts about the actions and choices of some of the characters and some very clever twists here and there to spice up your viewing experience.\\n\r\nWhat I love about this show\u2019s story is that it isn\u2019t focused on the events around only one or a small group of characters, but it rather expands itself to cover the events on the whole village and its people and view the story from both sides, both the humans and the Okiagari. So, that will help you get a feel of the broader plan of what is going on. Yes, it\u2019s quite common to expect the endless battle of humans versus vampires, but this time you get to see both sides. In fact, you might be even puzzled about actually labeling what is wrong and right, bad and good, from some point on. It\u2019s a fight for survival, after all, and each side naturally decides in favor of their own kind.\\n\\n\r\n~~ \u53cb\u5f15 \u2013 Tomobiki  Good luck, except at noon~~\\n\r\nA thing that\u2019s fascinating about the story, which shows the effort of the creators, is this small detail of the dates shown at the start of each episode, that is crucial though for one to complete the puzzle. Until the 19th century Japan used a lunar calendar of six days, each having a special meaning of bringing luck or misfortune. Shiki uses this in each episode to determine what the nature of this day is, usually foreshadowing the events to follow.\\n\\n\r\nShiki always loves cliff hangers in the ending of each episode, so you will find yourselves trapped in a roller coaster viewing ride, which will be getting more and more intense until it reaches its peak. But when starting watching, you\u2019re nowhere around guessing what would come out of all this in the very end. \\n\r\nI will admit that some of its final conclusions weren\u2019t so satisfactory to me, a few things felt abruptly wrapped up, so only there, is where I deduct a point, because the ending is very crucial to me. But, of course, it always depends on what everyone expects to find as a final resolution. So all in all it was one of the most intense anime rides I\u2019ve ever been on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I loved about this show was its characters. Oh, they were plenty of them, and all so versatile. One can never get bored watching this, since you will find all type of characters, and you can easily pick one or two with whom you maybe will relate and follow throughout the story. A lot of people are accusing Shiki of shallow characters. My answer to them is that not every story created should be character driven, and this isn\u2019t a story about teenage angst or a forbidden romance. You know were you got yourself into beforehand, am I wrong? So if you prefer stories focused on one character only, don't watch this.\\n\\n\r\nTo the rest, you've made a good choise, since you\u2019ll find yourselves in front of many familiar types of characters, not in terms of anime norms, but relating to real life-types of people. And you won\u2019t be the least disappointed about the depths of their personalities, despite the big number of characters existing in the show.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhat a wonderful day! No one in the village doing anything.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nNow, I don\u2019t know if some of you might have an experience of living or even staying for a while in a small village. If you do, as I have in my vacations, then you would recognize some types of people in Shiki. \\n\r\nThere are the small minded people that can\u2019t compromise with thinking outside their little shells, focusing their lives entirely on their daily village routines, forgetting about the rest of the world. There are the gossipers, who of course want to know every single news of the village, since the news isn\u2019t many anyway. There are the usual working people, who just do their jobs quietly each day. And there are also those who sit around in a chair doing nothing but watch the passers by and chit chat about mindless things. You can also find kids that want to escape this narrowed life experience and make their way to the big city and also a priest and a doctor who both try to find their own way to balance the life in the village.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the events of bizarre deaths start to unfold, everyone will act differently according to their character and beliefs, and that is what\u2019s the most fascinating about them. You\u2019ll see bravery, stupidity, cunningness, understanding, fighters and whiners, some even getting advantage of the whole thing. Generally you\u2019ll find many approaches and that is what makes the characters so enriched. Concerning most of them, you will never really learn any solid background information, and yet they feel so fleshed out and real. For a story driven show this is definitely a success.\\n\r\nAlso, don\u2019t forget that you\u2019ll get to know, many of the opposing threat side of characters, the Shikis, as they all have their own unique personality to show. Being the supposedly \u201cbad guys\u201d who everyone fears, doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be diverse.\\n\r\nAll in all I\u2019m more than satisfied from this show\u2019s variety of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe only point I deducted from this section is because of the use of some of them by the creators. I felt that characters like Natsuno, Megumi, Masao and a few others, could have been involved a little more in certain points of the story. They still are there and active, but they didn\u2019t intertwine with each other as much as I hoped to.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, Animation: 10\\n\\n\r\nNow this is, mostly, the section were haters of the show focus their flaming on. I won\u2019t try to persuade anyone that what I see is more right than what they see. But then noone can try to change my way of experiencing things, respectively. That needed to be said, before I say that I found the art and animation both to be brilliant!\\n\\n\r\nThe art is indeed unique. I am not trying to play it cool saying that.\\n\r\nUnique and different doesn\u2019t always mean it\u2019s good. If those same looking characters were dragged and dropped into any other type of show I would at least thought the people making it tasteless. But not in this case! \\n\r\nThe people who designed the characters knew exactly what they were doing. The faces have rough angles and the shape of their characteristics is unproportional. The hair is also so crazy that stands out from miles away. They all are like a weird cubistic imitation of some of Picasso\u2019s craziest paintings. But were other people find this unattractive, here is exactly how this fact elevates the story. This specific oddity makes Shiki stand out, looking like an old creepy fairytail that comes out of a dusty old book or from one of those bedtime stories that a grandma used to tell her grandchildren around the fireplace. They remind me of Tim Burton\u2019s seductive dark style and where could it fit better than in a story about vampires? \\n\\n\r\nVampires are anything but usual, they are extravagant, they are lavish but they are also fearsome and killers. So, the roughnesses of the sketches as well as the crazy colors depict the wildness of the story itself. Also the eyes of the Okiagari that don\u2019t have pupils make it feel like you are looking inside an empty shell, as referring to them not having a human soul anymore. The backgrounds are drawn very nicely making this look really to be this enclosed village that the story describes, one that is far from civilization. \\n\r\nA small detail I found very beautiful is the part where the eyes of the Shiki were glowing red in the night and then their shadow slowly appeared, making it very creepy to watch.\\n\r\nThe animation is equally good. Some movements may seem abrupt, but I think it adds more to the roughness of the story better than having gentle moves that create a smooth flow. So I really don\u2019t find anything wrong with the animation being more rough than usual.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic and Sound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe music section is many times the most neglected in a series. As a big music lover, I hate it when, otherwise good shows, have some lame BG music and sound to support them. Sometimes I do find one or good Opening and Ending themes that stand alone though, because usually the background music of those series keeps me indifferent. \\n\r\nIn Shiki though, the music is so brilliant that I don\u2019t know where to start the praise from. The melodies aren\u2019t just pretty or simply fit well, they are one with the show, the same entity. They blend so perfectly in each frame and time of the show that I\u2019m positive Shiki wouldn\u2019t be the same without its music score. \\n\r\nThe first OP is mysterious, seductive, special. The second OP is eerie, magical, like a dark lament. The endings are equally seductive, particularly the second one that reminds me of music of past decades, having a passionate and also sorrowful sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is equally awe-striking, it\u2019s sometimes playful, sometimes harsh, others soft or sending chills down your spine. The various tracks use from natural sounds to human voices. Some voices sound like a jukebox, others chanting or making creepy but melodic sounds. Each and every single piece used, elevates the show.\\n\r\nAs far as the voice acting is concerned, I saw a few new actors involved in this, which I find good for a change. They all did their work marvelously well, projecting each of the character\u2019s unique personality. And then they went through many phases, having to show pain, anger, fear, scream or whisper. They all had a hard job, but pulled it off perfectly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nMany times during a show I find myself indifferent about what is going on with the story and the characters. Some stories manage to grab my attention back again, but usually I always experience one or two times of boredom that I just have to be patient until the good parts come in. Not with Shiki. Every time I started watching this I felt like I was glued to my screen, completely forgetting what was going on in my surroundings or how did I end up watching this at those late hours, hearing and watching nothing else but the show itself. I found myself so concerned about everyone\u2019s fate, the art and music working like a magnet on me, that I just wanted this to go on and on as much as it was possible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 - 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who love intense experiences and look for a little more thought provoking shows Shiki will come as a real treat. It will keep you excited, at the edge of your seat, and at the same time it will make you the player of a big puzzle were you have to be very careful on what you see to finally create the whole image. What is equally cool about the whole viewing experience is that there are so many point of views from which you can observe this show that I\u2019m sure that watching it a second time you\u2019ll come up with different notes about it. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you love vampires or just love to watch a little deeper emotionally shows with a complete lack of pantie shots and silly fanservice, then this is exactly the show you\u2019re looking for. A traditional, creepy, mystical, magical, dark, haunting and twisted fairytale. So just grab a mug of hot milk and join us near the fireplace.\\n\r\nHave a nice and creepy ride! :)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks to everyone for reading this relatively long review. Please feel free to leave a comment on my channel with your thoughts about it or about the show.\\n",

            "content": "Vampires have been enjoying quite a renaissance in Western media lately, mainly because of the advent of Twilight. In anime however, tales of bloodsuckers have been pretty constant over the years, but like the West there has been an increase in the number of stories involving the children of the night. The only problem is, they all seem to romanticise vampires by giving them kind, gentle personalities, good looks, a reluctance to drink human blood, or some other hook to make the viewer believe that creatures who look on humans as food can be considered friendly.\r\nAnd then Shiki comes along and blows that whole ideaout of the water.\\n\\n\r\nOriginally a two part horror novel published in 1998 by Ono Fuyumi (which was later reprinted in five parts), Shiki was adapted for manga in 2007 by Fujisaki Ryu. Set during a summertime in the mid 1990s, several people in the small town of Sotoba in rural Japan are afflicted with a strange and incurable wasting disease, and the local doctor fears an epidemic may be starting.\\n\\n\r\nAround the same time a new family moves into the newly built Kanemasa mansion .\\n\\n\r\nShiki may not look the part at first glance, especially because of the colour scheme, but don't be fooled as there is actually quite a deep plot to this series, and while there is a degree of predictability about the storyline, this is balanced some good scripting and a more reasoned narrative approach. One of the things that separates this anime from more recent offerings is that it harks back to older vampire tales, so unlike Fortune Arterial, Rosario + Vampire, and other titles of that ilk, the undead in Shiki are unable to venture out into sunlight, nor are they able to enter a home unless invited, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to this there's an intelligence about the story that materialises in some interesting ways, from the doctor's logical approach to the town's crisis, to the strangely normal reactions of the local women at the beginning of the penultimate episode. Shiki could readily be compared to Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni as it explores certain aspects of human psychosis over the course of the series, and it's pleasing to watch an anime that doesn't assume that the audience are blithering idiots.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that may put people off though, is how everything looks. The town and rural scenery are nicely detailed and varied, but viewers may initially wonder at the incongruity of the bright colours, or even the European styled mansion sitting on a hill overlooking the town. Rather than a whimsical approach to the design, this is a purposeful nod at the stereotypical hilltop \"castle\" that is prominent in a number of  European horror stories.\\n\\n\r\nThis slightly methodical approach to design also manifests itself with the characters as it seems as though there has been an attempt to include just about every body shape into the series. Now while this adds a nice touch of diversity, there are some rather ludicrous additions which seem a bit out of place in a rural setting (one example is Ookawa Tomio, the owner of the liquor store, who looks like he was built in a shipyard). That said, the one glaring issue is that the vampires are easily recognisable because of their eyes, which is a bit of a shame as there are several scenes where the effect would have been heightened if there was less of a difference between the undead and humans.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, the production company Daume isn't really well known in the West, but the work they've put into Shiki bodes well for the future of the studio. The characters generally move well, and while there are some slightly ridiculous body positions and actions at times, there's also a bit more realism about the series since none of the undead can leap over buildings or fly through the air. The action sequences also benefit from this more realistic approach, but there are still a small number of scenes that \"bend\" the laws of physics at the very least.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that does bear mentioning is the quality and impact of the visual effects, especially the colour scheme, partly because of the variety, but mainly because they provide a number of scenes with some much needed emphasis.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, Shiki features some pretty decent acting, and a number of seiyuu really do put effort into their roles, even if they only have a minor speaking part. Now one could argue that this is to be expected from professionals, but sadly this isn't always the case as there are many anime out there that simply haven't understood that a poorly executed supporting role can spoil the performance of the leads.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside is that there are times towards the end of the series where the actors and actresses seem ... a bit too enthusiastic. Fortunately the seiyuu playing the main roles are there to steady things, and their performances are very good indeed.\\n\\n\r\nShiki is well served by a variety of incidental music, ranging from quiet yet slightly ominous music box pieces to haunting choral anthems, all with some slow techno beats thrown into the mix to round everything out. The series has two opening and ending sequences that, in all honesty, are a bit of a mixed bag. The first OP, Kuchizuke by Buck-Tick, is a pretty angry piece that actually fits well with the theme of the show, but sadly the second OP, Calendula Requiem by Kanon x Kanon, doesn't really work as it's a bit too J-pop for its own good. As for the EDs, the first one, Walk no Yakusoku by Nangi, is a slightly bittersweet track that echoes of triumph, and in all honesty it's difficult to judge how fitting the song is with this anime. On the other hand the second ED, Gekka Reijin by Buck-Tick (again), really does work well with Shiki, and the track is reminiscent of the music produced by some of the \"darker\" European rock/pop bands of the 1990s.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the effects, they're suitably gory when the occasion demands, but even poor effects would be raised by the quality of the choreography throughout this series. Everything from the music, including the OPs and EDs, to the pitch and cadence of the speaking roles, is timed very well, and it's clear a great deal of effort has gone into making this anime an aural experience as well as a visual one.\\n\\n\r\nNow one of the things that is clear from the opening sequence is that Shiki has quite a large number of characters. Normally this would mean that much of the developmental aspect of the storyline would focus on the leads, with the supporting characters reinforcing this growth, but Shiki takes a different line, and it's one that will hopefully be seen a lot more in the future. The main strength of this series is characterisation, and from the bit parts on up, every single role is clearly defined. The advantage to this method is that it's not always necessary to develop a well defined character, and Shiki follows this path almost religiously. While some growth does occur over the course of the series, what's most interesting is how each character adjusts and adapts to the events in the town. Probably the best example of this ethos in action is in the latter half of episode 14, and the methodical approach taken by the local doctor Ozaki Toshio is reflective of the fact that there is a degree of logic and intelligence in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty Shiki managed to surprise me. After the recent run of poor horror anime it's pretty obvious that I ventured into the series half expecting more of the same, so when I encountered actual intelligence in the plot, it came as something of a shock. That doesn't mean this anime is perfect though, as aside from the more obvious audio and visual flaws (like not washing off blood), there are several elements in the story that could have been resolved. That said, it's nice to watch a show that sets out to tell a story without assuming that the viewer is afflicted with the moe bug.\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason I like Shiki though, is because it doesn't fall foul of the drivel produced by authors of \"dark romance\", but instead postulates some moral and ethical dilemmas for the viewer to ponder. In addition to this it also highlights the human capacity for adaptation, something which is often overlooked in anime. If you're looking for an intelligent horror, then this series is right up there with the likes of Ghost Hound, Ghost Hunt, and other equally worthy shows.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that this is effectively a throwback to the type of horror that epitomises Bram Stoker's Dracula (without certain supernatural shenanigans), Shiki is something of an oddity in anime as the general trend leans heavily into romanticism and moe, and in all honesty I haven't seen a vampire tale this good since Kurozuka, which says a lot more about the anime industry than I can put into words.",

            "content": "I've seen my fair share of vampire anime; and I have to say, it was under vast number of genres, as well as themes.  Shiki however, pulls you back in to what the traditional myth of vampires; added to it that it's a thriller, it will move anyone who's a vampire fan.\r\nStory: 10\r\nCompared to many other vampire themed animes, such as Blood+, Rosario + Vampire, Vampire Knight, and Trinity blood; this anime comes back to the roots of vampires and their myths.  In this anime a town is plagued with death with no reasonable explanation; though thought of a possible epidemic, Doctor Ozaki,the head doctor of his clinic cannot find any actual symptoms related to any known disease, besides Aplastic Anemia, which is the loss of red and white blood cells. As the body count rises, he becomes desperate to find an answer until he comes up to a conclusion, albeit a far fetched one, that it might be a work of Okiagari, or vampires. His next problem then is to convince the village; of course such a mythical conclusion would \"never\" exist in the rational world.  As he tried desperately to prove the existence of okiagari, death sweeps through the town faster and faster, until soon, more than half of the population has been wiped.  Still they did not believe him. That is until he killed a vampire, named Chizuru, in front of everyone. Then the vampire hunt begins.  There are mini plots within the whole series that I will not divulge, go watch it to see.   At first, the anime's plot progression  might come up as slow to most people.  Even I had a hard time dealing with the first 3 episodes. But it get's really good.  The fact that the anime went back to the original vampire myths alone made me smile, such as that they can not enter a home until they are invited in, or that they die if stabbed with a stake at the heart, and the fact that they are UNDEAD; just including those classic myths already got me hooked.  This anime has definitely gave back the respect of vampires that Twilight has taken away.  And contrast to the other animes I've mentioned, very little gore is shown, at least until the way later episodes, even then, it was there as part of the ambiance, and not for its own sake. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe lines were sharp, and the colors were almost fluorescent. The art of the animation just didn't look like it fits with a subtle setting and plot like that. Not to mention the crazy hairstyles that almost every relevant character had.  It was like watching bakemonogatari but with better details. The animation would be more fit for shounen anime in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe1st season OP got me the first time I heard it.  It was almost celtic, and goes perfectly with the whole theme.  The BGM, it was not intrusive, but yet it'll make you want to jump at times; some even sound like something out of the catholic church, which is awesome due to the ties of religion to vampires;the good thing about it is that they also barely use BGM.  The 2nd season OP for some reason reminded me of one of the OP's of Rozen Maiden, i don't know why, but I didn't like it as much.  The 1st season ED is that like something off a romance anime though, but once you get to the later episodes, you will figure out why.  The 2nd season ED I liked because it was indie/soft rock for me, and it was calm yet eerie, which what the anime was about. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThere were really only 4 main characters in the anime; Sunako, Ozaki, Seishin, and Yuuki.  However, you will definitely be able to tell that EVERYONE is important, even the ones who died, or risen. This is because of the sub-plots, as I mentioned earlier, and they are awesome. However as much as that's a good thing, the downside is that no one really has any room to grow.  The viewer really can't see if there is any character progression. However, that really isn't necessary due to the big-picture nature of the plot. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nLike I said in the Story section, it is at first slow, but as the people die, and the vamipres close in to the main characters, it becomes a classic thriller.  At one point I actually jumped off my seat.  This take on the classic vampire is really something that needed to be done. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nBasically, if you hate twilight, you would love this.  It puts back the vampire's reputation of being mysterious, scary, and are considered \"monsters\".  It went back to the classics of vampire myths, and made it work quite well.  I really do hope that this anime becomes a classic; in case everyone needs to refresh that vampire actually DIE under the sun, and not sparkle like a disco ball. \\n\\n\\n",

I didn't feel any sympathy for either side. So I didn't end up contemplating life. Also I already knew humans are terrible. I guess a reminder didn't hurt? (Concept was good enough for bonus points in story rating. But, mainly, the endless blood showers \u2665)\r\nArt: 3/10\r\nI still remember when my brain just said, \"Deal with it, it's episode 17 already.\" The drawing style is unique but I didn't find it beautiful, it was bizarre. I guess it suits how messed up the animeis but it doesn't change things for me; didn't like it. Bonus points: Managed to live with it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nI actually liked the music and anything sound related, it was the one thing I couldn't complain about. It wasn't painfully out of place or too weird.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nOh wow. In one word, UNLIKEABLE. Most of them were painfully annoying or despicable. Even the kind ones were annoying to me, like that best friend guy that kept crying. I can't explain without spoilers but ask yourself, \"Is it worth ruining my day for?\" Not really. \"Why do that?!\" or \"Just do it!!\" moments are too many a person should ever experience in a single series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10?\\n\r\nI managed to sit through 24 episodes overall so it's compelling in its own way. Who's gonna die next?? Is everyone a piece of *** or will they actually grow as characters?? Tbh, it actually took me a few episodes to understand what was going on so there's some major potential this could have been shorter than it was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\n100% would not rewatch. 6 is actually generous but I base my ratings on concept potential usually. Don't get me wrong, it was compelling enough to keep me interested, BUT, it was compelling in a bad way. I kept watching to see if anyone of those fudgers actually pulls through for me. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: If you like messed up stuff, this could be for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEveryone's review seems to be raving about how good Shiki is and so I'm just wondering maybe there is something wrong with me. (Well, there must be if I managed to get through this bloody anime without losing my appetite but that's another issue.) Why did I bother to write this you may ask?? I think it might be nice for other people to have some closure that they're not abnormal for not raving about it and that it's not for everyone, I'm like Batman of the anime world.

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nHumans have two sides, the animal side which keeps us alive and human side which builds societies, laws, art. This side makes us what we are. Shiki tries to touch this subject. However, Shiki fails to achieve that on so many levels.\r\nShiki has one of most boring starts I have ever seen in anime, first episodes are sluggish and uninteresting. While viewer knows what the hell going on from as early as episode 3, characters in anime simply can't figure it out even with such huge evidence. Every character is god damn idiot. Even these Shiki's are idiotic they don't even tryto hide their presence.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in Shiki are annoying at worst and uninteresting at best. Given the Shiki's premise, it should be a very character driven show. However, characters are the worst part of the show. It seems people working on this had the competition of How can you make each character as unrealistic as possible while making them as annoying as possible? This is unacceptable. It is not like that Shiki didn't have enough episodes, rather than showing how each character is a douchebag, they could have shown the relationship between various characters making climax more heartbreaking. If characters had enough development for me to care about them, then this would have been very good anime, sadly that is not the case. The only likable character for me was Tomio Ookawa, the person who was killing Shiki's left and right and killed his dead son, probably the smartest character too.\\n\\n\r\nShiki liked by many because it shows moral ambiguity, let me debunk that myth. Now imagine that this entire village either died or people turned into Shiki's. These Shiki's still need to feed on other people and when they do, that person either dies or become Shiki. Now this will spread like an epidemic, how long do you think human population will last as more and more people will turn into Shiki's and others die. Shiki population will grow with increasing rate and human population will decrease with increasing rate. Soon there will not be enough humans to feed all Shiki's and hence Shiki's will die out. The conclusion is simple that Shiki's are unnatural as they dig their own grave, either way, they are doom for extinction. There not a single carnivorous in the world which would naturally do that kind of thing. Hence by definition humans have more right to live than Shiki's. Because of slow reproduction of humans, Shiki's will eventually run out of food. This premise is very well handled in Parasyte the maxim. There is no moral ambiguity here.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, Shiki is a mess of stupid characters playing kingdom kingdom.",

            "content": "Shiki had such an awesome premise, however, from my perspective  it fails to do that premise any justice. I will try my best to give a feel for the story, spoiler free of course. The story and artwork just weren't my cup of tea, but I understand some might enjoy this type of story / cast so I will attempt to avoid outright trolling.\r\nSTORY\r\nI was very disappointed in the story for a lot of reasons. It progresses painfully slow, and the character development eventually drops just about everyone in the 'gray area' between good and bad. So basically by the time the climax comesaround you have nobody to root for. You don't care if any of the main characters survive, shiki or human. \\n\\n\r\nART / SOUND\\n\r\nThis is what ruined it for me. I probably would have enjoyed the story more if the art wasn't so ridiculous. The hair on some of the characters...the hair. It's like Super Saiyans on crack. Gravity defiant, logic defying hair that makes the living humans look undead even though they're still alive. The elderly and even some of the young characters (Masao in particular) look hideous right from the start. It's not scary, in my opinion it's just unpleasant to look at. There's not much to say about the Sound. It didn't really leave an impression. The sound effects weren't always used the best way (I.E. Excessive cracking noises coming from a Shiki that is barely moving it's neck)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \\n\r\nA lot of the characters are so incessantly obnoxious to the point where you want them to die. Then they die. Then you realize crap this is Shiki, I have to wait for them to die a second time before I'm through with their BS. Even the characters you like in the beginning betray those good qualities by the middle / end. One more thing, chain smoking doctors aren't cool. You're supposed to be a doctor dammit, save those cigarettes for us non-doctors.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nShiki failed to live up to my expectations. I feel like Shiki never intended to give you a likeable cast. The point of the story is to submerge you in moral ambiguity with a bunch of mediocre characters and slow moving plot. Most likely the goal was to have the viewer ask him or herself in the aftermath of the climax \"What was (morally) good? What was bad? Was anybody really in the right?\". It's left up to the viewer to decide without the anime deciding which side was 'right' for you. Unfortunately, at least in my case, by the time I got to that point I didn't really care enough about the story, the characters, or the ending to think too hard about it.   \\n",

But what first starts as an epidemic, turns out to be much more. The first episodes might be boring.I didn't really enjoy watching them but later the show really getsgood.There is nothing such as an epidemic the reason of the deaths are Okiagari ( Some people might call them vampires ). Dead ones who come back to life. I'm really glad this anime is here. Because I'm sick of the shows who show only romace between humans and vampires. This anime is different. If you miss old school vampire animes,this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art is very abstract and I think the style is unique. Please don't be one of this people who hates Shiki because they say the art is weird. What? They are having interesting hairstyles.Really I never saw so much crazy hairstyles but this is not bad.The art could be better but I like it like it is.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI love the openings! The first opening really fits the anime. To be honest I didn't like it at the beginning but later I just started to love it ! The endings are ok to,but they look like endings of some romance animes. Shiki is just amazing. It has everything !\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThey aren't much main characters but that doesn't mean other are not important. You don't like Shiki because much people die? Well this is a part of this anime and if you give Shiki a chance you will see that everybody is important. The dead ones to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nLike I said the story is amazing. It's just to good to be ignored. If you still didn't choiced to start watching Shiki you're going to miss something. Clannad or Death Note didn't get popular in one day and look at them now ;)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nWhat is the next thing you have to do? :O\\n\r\nRight go and watch Shiki you will make me and every Shiki fan very happy. If you don't like the anime I'm sorry that I wasted your time. But I think it's worth watching.Do you love Twilight and hate vampires who kill and are \"scary\" you won't like this.But if you miss old vampire storys without a vampire and werewolf who are fighting for a girl,vampires who can go outside days and they sparkle -__- and stupid \" I love you \" that is every second sentence in Twilight. Sorry to all Twilight fans but I just want to tell you there is no romance in this anime. Well not that much,but sure there is,so Twilight fans there is something for you to ? ~ :)",

Unfortunately for them, it\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg.\\n\\n\r\nWith a cast of hundreds like this show has, it\u2019s essential that you set aside a special handful of characters for the audience to follow, so we can explore the story from several different perspectives.  Shiki has this requirement covered, as it gives us three very different pairs of eyes to look through.  First, we have Natsuno, a disgruntled teenaged boy who\u2019s been forced to move into this village with his new wave, idealistic parents.  He despises the village, and refuses to make any long term connections, believing that doing so will make it difficult when they finally move back out.  Of course, despite his best efforts, a close circle of friends do form around him.  In fact, Megumi...  One of the very first people to be killed by the mysterious epidemic...  Had an obsessive one sided crush on him...  and it seems that even death can\u2019t take her away.\\n\\n\r\nOur second leading role is Toshio Ozaki, the director of the primary hospital in Sotoba.  Having taken over the clinic from his deceased father, he\u2019s a driven and tenacious doctor who\u2019s initially baffled by the amount of people inexplicably dying around him, and having come up against a challenge like this, he will stop at nothing to overcome it...  And I mean nothing, as his quest for a solution leads to him experiencing and performing some of the cruelest acts imaginable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd our final lead is Ozaki\u2019s childhood friend, Seishin Muroi, a local priest and a moderately successful author.  His novels tend to be on the poignant side, dealing with subjects like loss, betrayal, and abandonment by God.  This attracts the attention of Sunako, the little daughter of the newcomers, who\u2019s apparently a huge fan of his work.  He forms a connection with her over time, as his pacifist religious beliefs gradually lead him to develop a sense of sympathy for the beings that his best friend Toshio has sworn to destroy.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is made up of smaller roles, the basic types of people you\u2019d expect to see in a tightly-knit little community...  You have business owners, rebellious teenagers, concerned parents, comfortable elders, nurses, teachers, happy go lucky children...  All of whom deal with the growing problem in their own unique ways.  And for such a large cast, the dub is surprisingly on point.  It\u201ds a Funimation effort, but it\u2019s a really odd Funimation effort, where the lead characters are all portrayed by actors that you normally wouldn\u2019t see attached to such high profile roles.  Toshio is played by David Wald, a long time actor who\u2019s somehow stayed completely off of my radar until just now.  I\u2019m going to have to keep an eye out for him in the future, because he rasps and grumbles his way into the jaded, chain smoking doctor as though he was born to play the part.\\n\\n\r\nSeishin Muroi is played by John Burgmeier, a man who rarely ever steps out from the technical side fo a dub for anything other than a bit part...  He directs, he writes, but when he acts, his subdued performances are normally outstanding.  He plays down-trod, broken men as though it were a second language, and his role in Shiki is probably one of his best voice performances since Gunslinger Girl.  Jerry Jewell also does a commendable job on Natsuno Yuuki, and you\u2019ll find pretty much every Funimation voice under the sun sprinkled here and there...  Hell, even Anastasia Munoz gets an appearance...  but the star of this dub has to be Cherami Leigh, who plays the ominous Sunako, who looks very much like she was taken directly from a Katy Towell cartoon.  I wish I could tell you why her performance in this role is so perfect, but to go into detail would mean giving away some serious spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s at least one bad egg in the dub, however, and surprise surprise, it\u2019s Tia Ballard.  Tia plays the role of Megumi Shimizu, a sixteen year old girl who dreams of getting out of her quaint, suffocating home town and going to a college in the big city.  And she will not shut up about it.  I know that in anime, non conformists are often portrayed as loud, disruptive nuisances, and they did a very thorough job of it with this character, but when you combine that archetype with tia\u2019s shrill, screechy voice, she single-handedly renders the first episode almost completely unbearable.  Thankfully, she only really has a strong presence in this episode.  Spoiler...  She dies in it.\\n\\n\r\nNow, when I tell you that this story is about a small group of protagonists struggling to put a stop to the mysterious deaths happening all around them, with ticking clock being their worst enemy, you may think that concept sounds suspiciously familiar.  Well, that\u2019s because you\u2019ve seen this same plot before, as Another and Hell Girl: Two Mirrors have both tried...  And failed miserably...  at making you care about it.  But where those two regrettable shows failed, Shiki succeeds with flying colors.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike Another, Shiki doesn\u2019t make over-the-top, ridiculous spectacles of it\u2019s death scenes, choosing instead to focus on word of mouth and the sad faces of relatives, so that it can liberally float between tragedy and statistic depending on the tone that any given death calls for.  And unlike Hell Girl Two Mirrors, Shiki paces itself, putting just enough time between each death so that it can drain the hope of the viewer, little by little, as it spirals down towards one hell of a catastrophic ending.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that manipulation of hope, Shiki is one of the most well executed horror anime titles that I have seen in a long time.  There\u2019s almost no filler in it\u2019s entire 24 episode run, as every single event that occurs has a distinct purpose, and is placed exactly where it needs to be in the narrative.  The first ten or so episodes are admittedly slow, building up the tension in the village to an almost OCD-like degree.  Very few answers are found here, as tragic death after tragic death drives the residents to either blind paranoia or complacent acceptance of fate.  By the second half, the nature of this menace has been all but revealed to the audience, even as our three main characters slowly come to terms with a truth they know they shouldn\u2019t accept, and with a terrifying threat that comes to face them almost immediately after they come to face it.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a brilliant, gripping story that will have you skipping through the otherwise beautiful openings and closings just so you can catch the next development as quickly as you possibly can.  While you may find yourself hard-pressed to experience any emotional reactions through the majority of the story, as death will inevitably become commonplace in this kind of story, there\u2019s enough disturbing, unsettling material in the final act that will not only horrify you, but will also completely subvert your expectations of a horror story.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I would love to continue to praise this series, and call it one of the most excellent horror titles i\u2019ve ever seen, I can\u2019t.  It\u2019s time to talk about the artwork and animation, and I can already feel my hand reaching out to grab hold of my bottle of Haterade.  Why?  Because this is one butt ugly show.\\n\\n\r\nOkay,. maybe that\u2019s not fair of me...  It\u2019s not the artwork itself that\u2019s bad, as it doesn\u2019t look sloppy or anything.  If anything, the backgrounds and environments are easily on the high end of the scale.  No, what I really have problems with is the art design.  The characters look ridiculous, with angular faces and giant, cartoony eyes, and so many bizarre, gravity defying hairstyles that even a Pokemon animator would say \u201cHey, dial it back a bit!\u201d  No, you know what?  Forget Pokemon.  Looking at Shiki\u2019s character designs is like watching someone from Clamp come up with their own Yugioh Spin-off.  It would be okay if this were some wacky comedy, but it\u2019s not...  Shiki is a mature, poignant show that asks you several profound questions and dares you to come up with your own satisfactory answers.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd if you really want to see this show go from ridiculous to horrifying in the blink of an eye, just wait until one of the characters starts to cry.  These characters don\u2019t cry the way normal anime characters cry...  They cry thick, opaque marbles of liquid that could make a serious claim at being one of the scariest elements of the show.  If you were to take a frame of it out of context, you\u2019d think you were looking at an image from some ill advised Eiken sequel...  And no, I am not even remotely joking about that.  The art design of this show is distracting as hell, and took me out of the story more times than I can count.  And the animation quality  is no prize either...  It\u2019s one of the cheapest looking shows that Bones has ever produced, and if you know Bones, you know how big a claim that is.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of this, Shiki is a very strong anime title that has a lot to offer you...  It\u2019s bold, thought provoking, and without a single hint of pretense.  It succeeds at exploring ideas and concepts that cause other shows to flop face down onto the floor, and if you\u2019re looking for a very broad hint at what these ideas are, one of those floppers is my old arch-nemesis Blood C.  Unfortunately, with an irritating first episode and a constant assault of distracting and sometimes even inappropriate eyesores, you have to put up with a lot of abuse to appreciate this show, so I really can\u2019t see it reaching the level of quality that it deserves to.  It\u2019s still a great show, and I strongly recommend checking it out, but I can\u2019t give it any higher than a 7/10.",

            "content": "Shiki, or Corpse Demon, is effectively the story of a village in the middle of nowhere being subjected to a mysterious string of unexplainable deaths. If you want to watch this anime and go into it 100% spoiler-free, even though this is not much of a spoiler at all, look away now.\r\nThe deaths are, of course, being caused by vampires. While they take their sweet time coming out and saying it, it's pretty obvious from a really early stage. But don't tell any of the characters that, because they don't half take their sweet time working it out. Over half the story is dedicated towatching the cast struggle to grasp something you worked out by the second episode, which is effectively this show's most crippling weakness.\\n\\n\r\nNow stop. Do not hit the \"Not Helpful\" button just yet. Before you have a knee-jerk reaction to this, let me clarify my point quite firmly: No, I do not, by any stretch of the imagination, think that assuming the existence of vampires to be true is a logical conclusion. Not by a long shot. However, there are several very simple logical steps they should have gone through that would have lead them to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe most glaring of these is shown through Shiki's focus on the medical aspects of the show. One of the few things that sets the story apart from every other vampire story is that we see the doctors dealing with all the deaths trying to work out and explain what is going on. This would be a lot more compelling if they didn't miss an obvious sign. They promptly go through every aspect of the deaths, but leave one thing out: every victim shares a pair of bitemarks on their neck. Aside from the symptoms themselves, this is the only thing that every single victim has in common. But the medical staff don't even try to explain it. On top of that, every patient died of severe anaemia, but had no rational way of losing so much blood. Except the bitemarks, the only possible explanation and a plain and simple way of putting the only two loose ends together.\\n\\n\r\nNow, once again, let me clear this up: I do not think that the bitemarks shoudl have instantly made them realise vampires were behind this. But so much about it makes it clear that vampires would have crossed their minds. Even if they initially brushed it off as implausible, they would have thought of it. Instead, this thought takes a long time to occur to anyone, and when it finally does, they are bizarrely accepting of it.\\n\\n\r\nBut even once they do realise it, they have to spend a long, long time convincing everyone else. In troper terms, this effectively leads to the villagers Dying Like Animals from sheer stupidity. Which leads to a highly drawn-out stretch of episodes consisting of Dr. Ozaki trying to stop the villagers from essentially jumping headfirst into their own graves.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, the characters of Shiki are, to put it generously, less than likeable. There is only one personality in the entire series that is simultaneously interesting and does not make you want to punch them in the face, and that is Dr. Ozaki. The remaining cast are either boring, or sociopathic for no apparent reason. There are also a small handful inbetween who are mildly interesting but very stupid. Effectively, this is both the best and worst thing about Shiki. On the one hand, the cast is utterly insufferable. On the other, they die. A lot. And it manages to be gloriously, gloriously cathartic.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also what makes Ozaki such an empathetic character. Ozaki is the only sane man in the entire village. And he is just as frustrated as you are at their complete lack of survival instinct. Also, despite some earlier absences of common sense, Ozaki really manages to pull out some incredibly impressive tactics. And I mean REALLY impressive.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of all the show's failings, in the final act it really gets it together and does a complete 180. This leads to an incredibly impressing finale, that is nothing short of a war. It leads to the point that anyone can (and probably will) die. Sadly this is only for the last 6 episodes, and at this point it is too little, too late. While these episodes were absolutely stellar, they don't quite justify watching the previous 16 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a technical aspect, Shiki ranks to the latter on the scale of good vs OH MY GOD WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!. The art style is about as awful as they come. The hair on the characters is the most stupid I've ever seen. Anime, as a medium, is known for its love of stupid hair, but even among them Shiki manages to be unbelievably appalling. The sound is quite a bit better, being a user of eerie ambient music. The first OP is also quite an excellent song, excellently merged with the animation. The remaining OP/ED themes are fine, but unremarkable.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned earlier that there were three ways that Shiki attempts to stick out from the vampire crowd, the first being the medical aspects. While none of these were very well-executed, they are still interesting: The other two being that the humans vs. vampires war is portrayed as simply being two opposing forces simply trying to survive, rather than good humans vs. evil monsters... and the third, being that they focus on the angst of those forcibly turned into vampires, having to kill people they once knew to survive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shiki has a lot of good ideas but in the end doesn't really execute them every well. It's a mixed bag, with enough upsides to keep it watchable earlier on, and with an excellent finale. Still, it really isn't worth watching in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 5/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: No seriously, what?/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni, Dance in the Vampire Bund.",

            "content": "I was directed to Shiki by a fellow anime fan who, like me, enjoyed more horror based anime. He insisted that Shiki was superior to shows like Another or Higurashi, since it created \"characters you cared about\".\r\nHaving now watched it, I am wondering what he was smoking.\r\nI'll go through each aspect individually. Tharrrrr be spoilers (at least in the plot section), so read at your own risk.\r\nArt = 5\r\nI'm torn on this one. On the one hand, the backgrounds are great. It looks like a small village. They are beautiful, though a bit colourful at times for an anime which is supposed to be \"dark\".Points also go to this one for mixing up the character designs and not having all the characters as beautiful supermodels. Though not excessively gory, the blood and gore aren't skimped on either, another important point.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other, there are big problems with the character designs. Some of the characters look utterly ridiculous. Seriously, what is with their hair? It detracts from the \"horror experience\". The best horror anime have characters who look vaguely like real people, not people who have had their hair styled by Ronald McDonald. Okay, enough about the hair. \\n\\n\r\nAnother nitpick I had about the art was how obvious it was when a character was turned, so to speak. Red eyes, glowing white skin, just unnatural looking. It might have been more interesting if it was hard to tell the two groups apart.\\n\\n\r\nI am pretty forgiving when it comes to art so I can ignore a lot of ugly if the story is decent.\\n\\n\r\nSound = 7\\n\r\nCredit where credit is due here. The majority of the voice acting worked for me. Everyone had a distinct voice and most of them were fitting. I couldn't tell you what any of the minor characters voices sounded like (or if they were \"off\") but that doesn't bother me in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is ... interesting. The openings are fine, for the most part. Ending songs aren't quite as good but still passable. Some of the in-show music works very well, in a creepy subtle way. By that token, there is also some that are too subtle and fail to evoke any mood. And then there's the weird pop-techno blend song that comes in once in a while. Each time I heard it, I spent the entire time trying to figure out what popular song it sounded like.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty good. It works. No real problems here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter = 3\\n\r\nWe start off by sticking close to a pink haired girl named Megumi. She is a stuck-up bitch who hates the town she lives in (and many of the people, including some who go out of their way to be nice) and has an unhealthy obsession with a boy named Yuuki. Think she's the protagonist? Nope.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about Yuuki? He's the outsider who's just moved to a new town and is slowly making friends. Again, not really the main character. We spend a good portion of time with him until about a third of the way in.\\n\\n\r\nThe people we spend most of the time with are the Doctor (Ozai) and the Junior Monk (Seishein). This is a mixed blessing, since Ozai is perhaps the most interesting and likeable character in Shiki. Megumi is, for the most part, annoying as all hell, though she gets better as the series goes on (and her role is downplayed). Yuuki is tolerable but never really breaks out as a character. He's the stoic (semi-)badass who says he doesn't want friends but has a good heart. Seishein is ... horrible. I know I'm supposed to agree with or sympathize with him since we spend a decent chunk of time with him, but he's a drag in every scene he's in. Ozai is perhaps the most logical and realistic of the characters. He realizes something is wrong and he ATTEMPTS TO FIX IT!\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the characters is development. There is a large cast of characters, the majority of which aren't important anyway, which means we don't spend enough time with any character to get too attached to them. And very few of these characters change in any meaningful way. Most of the characters are the exact same whether alive or dead, though the dead do angst a bit. \\n\\n\r\nThe character I had the most sympathy for was the girl in the track suit. She's young, unprepared for this, forced to choose between doing unthinkable things and dealing with friends and family who have risen. Her increasing instability is one of the few interesting changes within the series. Too bad she's downplayed in the second half.\\n\\n\r\nPlot = 3\\n\r\nThere are spoilers now. You have been warned.\\n\\n\r\nShiki is about vampires. If you didn't know that going in, you would have figured it out by the second episode at the latest. \\n\\n\r\nIt takes the rest of the characters at least another three or four episodes to catch up. The plot is sloooooow. Most of the mystery, if there was any to begin with, is dispelled right away. Every once in a while, something interesting would happen and I felt like I wanted to see what was next. Then the plot would drag its feet a few episodes with no substantial progress being made.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up the first 2/3rds of the plot, the vampires are killing people. A lot of people die. Only Doctor Ozai, Seishein and a few kids realize what's going on. Then the kids drop off the face of the earth for a while and barely factor in again (with one exception). Most episodes in this bit focus on Ozai  trying to do something, the townsfolk doing nothing and Seishein being tormented. Should he do something? (YES!!!!)\\n\\n\r\nTo repeat, the vampires kill a good portion of the population and no one is all that disturbed about it. \\n\\n\r\nIn the last 1/3rd, the show does a 180 and tries to make us sympathize with the vampires. This might have worked if they hadn't been mercilessly slaughtering townsfolk for half of the series. There are some moments where you genuinely think the vampires have been dealt a shitty hand (not choosing to become one but being forced by whoever bit them), but they are few and far between. Suddenly, the humans are the bad guys for protecting themselves and their families against the immortal people who have been murdering them.\\n\\n\r\nWhile many of the humans who are cleansing the vampires are obviously enjoying the experience waaaay too much, it's hard to argue that they're wrong in doing it. Should the vampires survive, the humans will just be mined for blood until there are none left. You can complain that the vampires want to live too and they've retained their memories, but the bottom line is that their existence is just to kill former neighbours and friends.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's just moments of incredible stupidity.\\n\r\n-At one point, it's suggested that the Shiki want to convert all the humans they can so the village is entirely Shiki. This would make sense, if you forgot that they NEED the humans for sustenance. Without them, the vampires starve. \\n\r\n-A third to half the town is wiped out and everyone is content to believe it's an epidemic, yet make no effort to do anything about it. \\n\r\n-No one questions why there are now large populations of people who work only at night, why many families have just disappeared and where the death records have went.\\n\r\n-Ozai makes a tape of him dissecting his wife, proving the existence of Shiki .. then shows it to no one. \\n\r\n-If you can figure out Seishein, you deserve a cookie, his entire character and motivations make no sense. \\n\r\n-The technology problem prevalent in horror. Why does no one phone about this? \\n\\n\r\nThe final few episodes make an attempt to tie everything together but it only partly satisfies. Many of the characters motivations are still stupid and there are jumps that we're never shown.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't to say that there isn't ANY depth in Shiki. There is. It just happens to be muddied by other aspects. In the second half of Shiki, we start being presented with questions about the value of life, whether it is ethical to kill (if your life is on the line), the propensity to deny rather than act. The questions are interesting. It's the way they're executed that doesn't do them justice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 4\\n\r\nI wanted to like this series. I really did. And there were some positives. I liked that they used some old-school vampire tropes (not being able to enter buildings without being invited ect). I liked the tracksuit girl. I liked Doctor Ozai, who has a couple of badass moments (though not enough!). \\n\\n\r\nIt's the pacing and the plotting that really let this series down. For every thought-provoking idea (\"is it right to kill someone else so I can live?\") or genuinely nice/interesting moment, there is much more padding. And stupidity. No one (besides a few characters) seem to ever catch onto what's happening before they kick the bucket. Everyone is so complacent that you wonder whether they're all too stupid to live. I was ready to scream at these characters sometimes. DO SOMETHING! \\n\\n\r\nOverall = 5\\n\r\nSee above, really.\\n\\n\r\nShiki has potential, but squanders it by dragging everything out and failing to make any compelling characters.\\n\\n\r\nLook ma, no Twilight references!",

One thing that immediately stands out is how well it manages to colour that village: even the simplest of residents are given an identity. The entire town has about 1200 residents, and this show manages to make them so life-like that you actually feel like part of the village as the series goes on. It creates a truly excellent backdrop for the series to take place in.\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, Shiki is a horror series. It\u2019s got a really thick atmosphere and most of the time it\u2019s just building up and dragging the viewer within this atmosphere. It\u2019s got plenty of disturbing scenes though, and that\u2019s really where it\u2019s at its best at. Now, there are times at which this show feels like this series is moving a tad slow and that it\u2019s building up a bit too much. But trust me: it all pays off in the end with a fantastic conclusion. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say about it.\\n\r\nThe character designs in this series are\u2026 unique. I admit that they take their time to get used to, but that\u2019s not really a problem considering the charms of the different characters. It\u2019s perhaps not the series with the best characterizations, but they are written really well: when they\u2019re developed, it\u2019s done very boldly. The characters are also incredibly diverse, ranging from teenagers to adults well in their thirties, forties and fifties and that overall makes it into a great and huge cast to watch.\\n\r\nMost of the best episodes of Shiki are located at the end so it takes some perseverance to really get to great parts of the series, but the weak moments are very few and far in between. It\u2019s got a haunting soundtrack and a stunning atmosphere. It\u2019s not something you should watch when you can\u2019t stand gore, but it\u2019s a must-watch for anyone even remotely interested in horror.",

            "content": "If you want vampires done right then this is the show for you.\r\nThe story of Shiki takes place in a rural Japanese village called Sotoba that the only thing the residents do is gossip. New residents called the Kirishiki's moved into town and from then on mysterious deaths occur throughout the town and there are reports of the dead coming back to life. The one that suffers the most because of this is Toshio Ozaki, the doctor of Sotoba, because he wants to know why these mysterious murders have been happening. He later believes that the cause of the deaths are something more supernatural anddecides to investigate. Until he reaches a conclusion that the vampires are the cause of the murder and from there on it's just mass genocide of the vampires where the town decides to eliminate the epidemic and reclaim their town.\\n\\n\r\nThe major problem with this show is the first half. Not gonna lie I almost fell asleep during the first half of the show, but after episode13 then the show gets really good.\\n\\n\r\nShiki has a really disturbing tone. The one soundtrack that plays throughout the show is a little girl sing \"Lalalaaaaa, lalalaaaaa\" while a piano note plays in the background. That just gave me the creeps.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters that I am going to give mention to is Toshio Ozaki because he arguably the best character in this show. Another character is the local priest Seishin Muri who develops a relationship with Sunako Kirishiki and the bond they share is believable. The other character is Natsuno who is one of the few characters who believed early in the series that there were vampires and eventually becomes a jinrou, a vampire that possesses human traits like walking in the sun and eating regular food.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one character that is voiced by Todd Haberkorn that is just so FUCKING annoying. Now he is one of my favorite voice actors, but god dammit is his voice annoying in this show.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said this is a show that does vampires right. It also adds a few layers to modern day vampires like different types of vampires and the process of turning into a vampire. The series starts out slow, but picks up towards the second half. Shiki also towards the end makes you feel really sympathetic towards the vampires because they are suffering not being human. In addition this show has very graphic scenes that I can remember just how grotesque the art and animation was for this show. However, the second half of this show is best part. That's why I'm giving it a 8/10 and give it a recommendation.",

            "content": "\u201cDeath is impartial to everyone, be it the young or old, rich or poor.  Thus death is not particularly tragic.\u201d\r\nShiki is by far the most riveting, suspenseful and thought-provoking series I have seen all year.   Truly a category of its own, it not only contains elements of horror and mystery but also makes you question what truly is considered good or evil?\r\nStory\r\nThe story is set in a small village where a string of unexplainable deaths start to occur.  What is suspected to be an epidemic proves to be something the villagers would never suspect. The main plot and characters are introducedin the first few episodes, while pacing is slow, it provides an important backdrop to the rest of the episodes.  As the story progress, we start to see what is really going on.  What I like most about this series is it\u2019s nack for detail and realism.  Even as some of the characters gradually figure what is going on, there is a vehement disbelief from the villagers in general.  The anime pays tribute to vampires well, but even better it addresses our society\u2019s inability to accept those who are different (be it humans or the supernatural).  In addition, what I think is the highlight of the series has been the last few episodes where the line between good and evil, humans and vampires have been crossed. What defines a \u2018human\u2019, can someone who still feels emotions be considered a \u2018monster\u2019?  Shiki makes us questions that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nWith Shiki\u2019s large cast, it seems likely that characters who don\u2019t get as much screen time to be very shallow and two-dimensional.  However, I didn\u2019t get that feeling in this anime.  Most of the characters have enough background story told to \u2018flesh\u2019 them out.  And they aren\u2019t ridiculous or unbelievable background stories, you could say we all knew these kinds of people at some point in our lives.   I would say the two most intriguing characters are Muroi and Ozaki.  Both carry the great burden of knowing the truth behind the deaths but make completely different decisions in the end.  And many other characters surprise me by fighting against expectations.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork\\n\\n\r\nRich colours, dark lines and detailed shading.  Some of the horror scenes are reminiscent of Higurashi with its emphasis on the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nGothic opening song and melancholic ending. Background music is very appropriate and adds to intensify the scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI literally marathoned 18 episodes non-stop.  It always kept me guessing as to what would happen next.  Shiki is also one of the few animes that has underlying meanings to them, it really made me think about the actions of some characters and what some characters have said (particularly Sunako).  I\u2019m looking forward to watching the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime to anyone who has a fondness for thought-provoking shows.   It\u2019s definitely not comedic, if that is what you\u2019re looking for.  But if you appreciate mysteries, dark themes and some psychological reasoning, then do give Shiki a try.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Now that I've finished the series, I'm dropping the score from a 10 to a 9, simply because the ending wasn't as great as the middle.  Perhaps my expectation were too high for the ending, I just found it wasn't what I expected.  It is also is pretty up in the air, which might suggest a second season.\\n",

            "content": "Alright, this is my first time with a review so bear with me!\r\nStory: 8\r\nShiki did pretty well in this category. It was refreshing to watch a vampire story that didn't make you want to become one. They went back to the old school myths, where vampires can't be killed unless you put a stake through their heart, and they fear things like relics and crosses. They were actually the bad guys. There are already a lot of great romanticized vampire stories out there, so it's really nice to find the opposite.\r\nThe episodes were well paced, and the anime as a whole did a great jobat keeping you on your toes and making you want to watch the next one. It did start out a little slow. The first few episodes were mostly just to give you a perspective on what the villagers were like and how future events would effect them, but at the same time you couldn't really skip them because there were bits and pieces you would need to see in order to understand anything that happened later. Once that was past though, the anime picked up really fast, so much so that I had a hard time waiting to see what was going to happen next. Watching an anime that's like a book you can't put down is a huge plus.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself was a little holey. As someone who likes a little science behind their fiction, I was disappointed that they didn't delve into the facts about why the vampires hated sunlight or what made them rise. But that's a minor mishap. My real problem was that there was no real back story to the Kirishikis at all. The main antagonists in the story were completely left without any context. While they hint at things here and there, you never really know anything about them. Especially Seishirou, and that really bugs me!\\n\\n\r\nI have to applaud them for not being afraid to kill of characters, though. Far too many horror anime are hesitant to actually kill anyone, and sort of beat around the bush, instead. Especially when it comes to prominent characters, or younger ones. That probably sounds harsh, but it's really frustrating when characters just barely make it out alive, by miraculous events, over and over.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThis is where the anime really falls apart. To be fair, the art wasn't truly bad. It was clean and well drawn, and the backgrounds were definitely on a higher scale. The real problem was the style. This especially in the character designs. Almost every character in the show, whether main or just a filler, had the most ridiculous, gravity defying hairstyles. It was annoying to say the least, and incredibly out of place in a horror anime. Even in a comedy, these hairstyles would be considered over the top. The eyes were just as bad. Not only were they too big for most of the character's faces, they were so awkwardly colored. Especially Muroi's, I will never understand why his were so different from everyone else's. The eyes also took away an element of surprise that the show really could have benefited from. If only they hadn't made the vampire's eyes such a dead give away.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was on the crappier side, as well. It seemed to be quickly, and cheaply, thrown together. Many shortcuts were taken. In many scenes the people don't even walk, they just sort of fade in and out across the screen. And there was a lot of still pictures that just slowly zoomed out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the art was way too distracting, and I almost dropped the anime because of it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nI don't normally pay as much attention to this category as the rest. The music sounded okay to me. Nothing I'll be putting in my iTunes, but it worked with the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really brings this category's score down was the dialogue. Now I only watched the dubbed version, so I can't speak for the original Japanese! But Christ, this was terrible. So many of the lines were awkwardly placed, or seemed to be missing a lot of context. And a lot of the characters would say things that completely clashed with their personalities. Again, this could just be because of poor translation, but as an official dub I really think they should have done better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nI was so disappointed with the main characters in this anime. All three of the most important ones had almost the same personality. Distant, a little cold, and angry (at either themselves or just everyone in general). There was no diversity! I know it's a more serious anime, but they should have branched out a little, at least between characters. The amount of generic personalities nearly killed me. Other individuals seemed a little displaced, especially Megumi. I know she was supposed to have an outsider kind of feel to her, but they went a little too far with it, and she seemed like she didn't even belong in the story at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part out of all of it is they never gave you a character you truly got attached to. There was no emotional connection, none of the characters were really likable. Megumi was obnoxious, Natsuno was too reserved for you to even really get to know who he was at all, Dr Ozaki was way too cold, ect ect ect. There was at least one reason to hate every character. I really could care less who died and who survived, and that really took a toll on my experience with this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6?\\n\r\nThat being said, I did still enjoy the series as a whole. Yes, they could have done better in a lot of areas, but I still kept watching regardless of it all. It's got it's own way of making you want to watch it. If not for any reason other than who's gonna die next, will that person rise up, and is everyone kind of evil or will there actually be some character development? I will definitely never re-watch it.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure I'd recommend this anime, though, especially if you're new to it! Don't ruin your first experience with something that's so-so. If you're really looking for an intriguing, gory horror story, go watch something like Mirai Nikki instead.",

            "content": "As with all of my other reviews I decided to write a review about the anime Shiki because I found it to be really enjoyable (so far) and wanted to spread some of the love by hopefully persuading people to try it out for themselves! In my review I will talk about what I find to be good about the show and which aspects could do with some improvement.\r\nStory: 10\r\nI\u2019ve watched a total of 16 out of 22 episodes of the show and have so far loved every single episode of it! Vampires singling out a small remote town and picking off each of the(mostly) unsuspecting residents one by one, the story may seem clich\u00e9d when presented to those who haven\u2019t watched the show, after all vampires are no new occurrence are they? But the vampires featured in this show (referred to as Shiki or moving corpses) are a breath of fresh air to those sick and tired off the angsty, misunderstood veggies vampires rife in today\u2019s media. These vampires return to their original Stoker-esque roots, not being able to go out in sunlight, fearing crosses and not being able to enter a home unless invited making the show far scarier overall than if it were just another cheap imitation of the Twilight saga.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no single main character in this series, every character no matter how minor plays some kind of role in adding to the rich tapestry of the overall story. However the story mostly revolves around the Shiki and those with direct experience with them. The three main protagonists, Natsuno, Akira and Kaori are you three average teenagers until the Shiki strike. Yet they\u2019re forced to grow up pretty sharpish as they start to work out what\u2019s really been going on behind the facade of a supposed epidemic and go about trying to save the blissfully clueless town. That\u2019s about it for character development which is a shame but necessary as if the show were to focus on each and every character it\u2019d never end! \\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to note that everyone in the show\u2019s expendable, even the main characters. This I love as it helps to increase the tension felt by the viewers as their favourite characters are caught in rather sticky situations.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nFrankly, I\u2019m not a fan of the kooky art style. It kinda ruins the overall look of the show to plop crazy looking characters (sometimes with hair bigger than them!) into such beautiful backdrops. But if you\u2019re into art a little bit unique and out of the ordinary you may find you like it! The show has a good range of ugly and beautiful people, making it far more realistic than the average anime which could be considered a positive I suppose! The animation of the show however is superb. It\u2019s hard to describe but it was great to see scenes in which the animators would try to do something a little different to keep things visually exciting!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nAll four of the opening and ending themes are so beautiful it\u2019s almost impossible to say a bad word about them. The second opening is in my opinion the best as it adds puts a beautifully eerie spin on the show capturing it rather nicely. The insert themes are pretty creepy too. They\u2019re not noticeable to the point of annoyance yet you hear enough of them to know when shit\u2019s gonna hit the fan! \\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI\u2019ve immensely enjoyed this show so far. After recovering from an arguably slow start the show keeps getting better and better and the character\u2019s situation becomes increasingly dire. Each episode ends with an edge-of-the-seat cliff-hanger leaving me desperate for yet another episode each and every week. I\u2019d definitely recommend this show to any fan of the horror genre of anime, lovers of the traditional vampire, and haters of Twilight alike. I hope this has helped you a little on your decision of whether or not to watch this show! Bye~!\\n",

If we discuss vampire in anime, many words that come out. The phrases that often comes out are romance (Rosario to Vampire etc), and action (Hellsing and Trinity Blood) Many vampire anime got mixed up by those set-up while Shiki did a different thing than the others. Shiki throws tons of mystery to the plot, the story itself is more focused to the plot and fewer fillers. The story set-up in Sotoba. A village with large numbers of mysteriousdeaths that never happen before. The villagers didn't know what threat that will come to haunt them. \\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting from this story are they take a different viewpoint of the storyline. It's just so rare to found an anime that does that in the right place.The story has 3 leading roles, with a different point of view. While the pacing is different, The story goes with medium-slow pace, while  the individual elements of mystery discovered one by one. Shiki has a little dull feeling in the early episode , but as the story evolves with mysteries & excitement in the air. My eyes just ask more, and more. The enjoyment shines in the finale. In just the end of 10 seconds of this anime, I saw a cyclone right in front of my eye. \\n\\n\r\nI know that many viewers dislike the art of this anime. It's similar with 90's anime. \\n\r\n But, if you looked deeply, the art really represents the feeling of the story itself. The animation is done well, it represents fear and darkness in the night, and bring bright feeling when the morning in the story comes. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound settings are one of the most brilliant ideas. I'm not talking about quality, I'm talking about how much darkness feeling that spit out from the opening theme. While the ending was decent. The seiyuu did well in bringing such characters to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nWith millions of peoples within Shiki, it's really dangerous for the balance of the story. While other people think Shiki need do more development in their character, and they do have.. But, if we think logically, \"How can we make a deep character in just 22 episodes, while the cast is crowded?'', even the best writer will be confused with this kind of question. But Shiki answers that ''We just need the major development in the essential characters, and throw a proper role to the rest...\". The characters  had their own proper roles, it's not perfect but it's enough to balance the story up.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's all about Shiki, a rare breed vampire theme. The anime do more to the plot although have some lack of points in the characterization, but it's worth to watch. If you seek a deep character, you won't get a bonus. But, if you interested to see a serious plot with a real vampire in the anime form, then the anime is for you.",

            "content": "As the Sun sets below the mountain peaks, the rural village is masked completely in an inescapable darkness. Silent. Untouched. Tranquil.  Unknown to them, the horrors that lurk outside, the villagers sleep on in blissful ignorance, as the creatures of the night gather in the confines of the woods. Darkness is broken; tranquilly smashed, to the sudden crimson red glow of eyes, illuminating the area with the red allure of blood. The Shiki have arrived for their next meal...\r\nHorror and anime are rarely synonymous with one another, and, despite the medium barely producing anything horror related to begin with, the few horror titles thatare out there don't exactly evoke fear in me. They either become unintentional comedies, such as in the case of Another, a show that took itself way too seriously, featuring the plot of a B-movie, while I laughed my ass off at every single stupid plot revelation and death (as I type these words, I feel more like a sociopath since I keep repeating the scene of the girl falling down a flight of stairs unto an umbrella, with it piercing her throat, as I chuckle to myself in amusement), or the character designs for the show are too distracting for me to take seriously and end up ruining the horror elements, such as in the Higurashi series. The only anime that has ever actually lulled me into a state of fear is Shiki, a show way back from 2010, and is one of the few vampire-esque anime I can think of that doesn't use their vampires for yaoi fanservice (although to be fair, Shiki does feature some hella pretty boys!) However, while excelling in the audio-visual department to create a genuinely creepy atmosphere, Shiki's narrative is less than stellar unfortunately, reducing it more so from a show with themes about morality in regards to the idea of survival and human instinct, to instead that of a campy B-movie, with a finale that is an absolute bloodbath, reminiscent of the level of gore found in 90s OVAs! Anyway, I've talked for too long now. Let's grab our stakes, our torches, and slaughter some Shiki! \\n\\n\r\nDuring a particularly hot summer in a rural, isolated village in Japan, a young, 15-year-old girl dreams of a glamorous life in the city, free from the hardships that come from living in the countryside, until she mysteriously dies, causing a stir in the once quiet community. This subsequently triggers a series of mysterious deaths within the village, which just so happens to coincide with the arrival of a new family by the name of the Kirishikis (no surprise, that, from their name, this family are indeed the \"Shiki\", the family of vampires who have been indulging in the blood of the villagers). As this unknown epidemic begins to take more and more lives, the town's doctor slowly loses his own humanity in order to solve this mystery, and to discover the true intent behind the new family's arrival! \\n\\n\r\nOne can divide Shiki's narrative into three main arcs. The first arc in which the villagers attempt to learn what this epidemic actually is, and what is causing all of this death, mainly serving to slowly build tension and atmosphere, the second arc in which we see the Shiki transforming other people into vampires (or killing them, as the viewer learns that when bitten, some turn into Shiki themselves, or just simply die), and the battle between the humans and Shiki for survival right at the very end. While this concept does sound good paper, it's execution leaves a lot to be desired. \\n\\n\r\nFor starters, Shiki's pacing, especially at the beginning, is rather slow and tiresome, although the slow pacing can perhaps be argued as a positive element as it helps to build narrative tension, resulting in a rather fun payoff, and helps to create more mystery surrounding the Shiki themselves. Not only that, but the setting of the narrative complements this idea. Since it is set in a rural village, deep into the mountains, it creates a feeling of paranoia and isolation, which only grows more and more as the episodes go along, so the pacing is important in establishing atmosphere. However, the slower nature of the show always came across as more aggravating to me, than anything else, since many of the characters are stupid beyond belief! While the villagers originally believed that the cause of these deaths was that of Mosquito bites, it takes them a rather long time to figure out that Mostiquto bites do not come in pairs, nor are their bites always at the same distance from one another. Of course, I'm not expecting them to jump to the conclusion immediately that vampires are indeed behind this, since that seems rather far-fetched and silly to assume in reality, but the amount of time they spend on the Mosquito bite theory is truly annoying, since, we, as an audience, already know what is happening and just want the plot to actually go somewhere. The narrative attempts to try and hide the fact that the Shiki are vampires and slowly stretches out the answer, which, not only ruins any chance people may have of possibly re-watching the series since the revelation is so obvious, but it can also be rather tedious to watch. Hell, Stevie Wonder could have figured it out before these guys could!\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem the narrative faces is the sheer amount of characters introduced, and the lack of much time to flesh out anybody, making it hard to remember who is who. That's not to say that there aren't some decent characters, however. Take, for example, the doctor who I mentioned before, Ozaki, who is the only character actively trying to discover the secrets plaguing his village! Ozaki's transition of losing his humanity for the survival of the villagers is easily one of the most interesting parts of the show. We see him slowly transform from man to monster and this is handled well enough to never feel forced; the transition feels natural and well-paced taking its time throughout the duration of the early parts of the series as we see this man become more and more obsessed with finding the truth. As such, it makes for an interesting character study of a man's internal turmoils regarding ethics and survival. Another somewhat interesting character is the leader, so to speak, of the Shiki, a young girl (only in appearance mind you!) called Sunako, whose back-story was actually pretty interesting and was enough to somewhat justify why she acts the way she does, which helped me greatly in being able to sympathise with her and her struggles. Her character allows the viewer to understand the Shiki and their way of life, as well as the inherent hardships that come along with it. She brings attention the idea that the Shiki have no choice but to kill the humans for their survival otherwise risk being killed themselves, bringing forth interesting ideas about how ethics and morality change dependent on the context in which one views it from. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast, however, were just really unlikable, and I honestly didn't care if most of the cast survived or died. The worst example is a girl called Megumi, who I mentioned at the very start of the review, and was the first person to \"die\". I put die in inverted commas, because, even though she did technically die, she came back as a Shiki. While the other characters who do come back as such are played out in a tragic way, represented more so as victims of circumstance, and while Megumi falls under this to a certain extent, she takes active pleasure and delight in killing the humans with very little justification as to why she would do this, aside from, perhaps, because she had a crush on a guy who paid her no attention, as we are told in the fourth episode of the show. By the time she inevitably kicks the bucket, the show tries to convey it as a tragedy and expects us to feel sorry for this twat, which doesn't work since she had been such a horrible person the entire time. It's this sudden juxtaposition in victimisation that rubs me the wrong way and is present a lot in the show. Every time a character in Shiki does die, they expect me to be sad, through the use of victimising them, instead of actually building up a character I can care for; it feels more cheap and lazy if anything else. \\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to care about the tragedy in the narrative since most characters acted like idiots, and got what they deserved, with the humans killing their reborn loved ones, without any remorse or sympathy. The show tries to convey the idea of who the real monsters in the show actually are: the humans or the Shiki themselves, but since each bunch of characters are so unlikable, I didn't give a damn really. In order for this tragic story to work, we needed to have characters in which the audience could care about as actual people, instead of the cheap victimisation the show utilises to try and manipulate us into feeling something for these cardboard cut-outs.  That's not to say that the show is completely devoid of emotion, however, since it is effective in one or two places. One such example is in the first episode of the Shiki OVA, but the scene was mostly enhanced by the music and voice acting than the actual writing itself. It's not as bad as some of the other moments in the show, like Megumi's final scene which uses cheap writing, since, in the OVA scene, Nao's character, a human turned Shiki, is given time for one to learn about her ordeals and regrets at being a Shiki, while being tormented by those in which she has killed out her hunger, which actually results in a very emotional moment. If the show had more scenes like this, it would have improved the overall.\\n\\n\r\nAs a spectacle, however, Shiki is entertaining as hell! The bloodbath at the end of the series is extremely entertaining to watch unfold and is pure blood-shed, fan-service in its purest form! Not only that, but the music and the atmosphere this show evokes is fantastic! Each track is eerily creepy or heart-wrenchingly sad, enhancing each scene wonderfully. My favourite tracks being \"Day and Night\", \"SHI-KI\" and \"Requiem\". The two openings end endings are also of a pretty high quality, with both openings representing their respective story arcs very well. As a fan of horror, Shiki was a treat to watch, and there were many scenes in the early parts of the series that were handled with a lot of care and made me feel genuinely frightened. The best example of such is the ending scene of episode four, where we see Megumi, now a Shiki, stalk her crush, one of the other main characters by the name of Yuuki,  who is staying over at his friend's house. The scene builds tension perfectly, and, after both we and Yuuki let our guard down as we believe we are safe from Megumi, she appears from underneath the bed, sliding and twisting her body; the sounds of bones and joints clicking into place, her cold crimson red eyes staring directly at both us, and Yuki. Everything about the scene is intensely disturbing and creepy and has stayed as a vivid image in my subconscious for years to come, and there are many other scenes like this too! Visually, Shiki is consistent but also pretty bizarre in terms of its character designs, with each character having insanely strange hairdos; it feels pretty gothic-like, which is something I can always dig; it's like a romanticised version of Bram Stocker's classic novel. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it, Shiki is a fun show to watch due to the sheer amount of blood and death, while genuinely creating a horrific atmosphere all the while featuring an amazing original soundtrack. However, the script falters in many areas, unfortunately, and aside from maybe two or three characters, I didn't care for the rest of the cast at all. It's one of those shows you watch for the spectacle of it alone, rather than a well-written narrative or developed characters, and I certainly believe Shiki achieves its goal on that end. While its use of victimisation to make the audience feel for a character that hasn't been built up is not as bad as other shows I have talked about before, such as Elfen Lied, it does feel somewhat lazy and cheap to do so, but, despite all that, I still had fun watching the show, and I believe that's important. Shiki, to me at least, was fun! It's shlocky, sure, but watching Shiki, especially for the final third, is an incredibly enjoyable time, and for that, I'd recommend giving the show a shot!",

            "content": "*This review contains spoilers*\r\n'Shiki (Corpse Demons)' tells the story of vampire invasion (who call themselves Shiki) in a remote rural village, and the struggles of select residents in their resistance in the advent of the mysterious new threat.\r\nThe story is told through perspectives of quite a few main characters in this show. We follow the unfolding of events mostly through Yuuki Natsuno, Ozaki Toshio, and Muroi Seishin, but none of them particularly stood out as the protagonist, and all probably had screen times of less than 10%. It's a shame, really, since the story involves abundance of mystery, and leaves so much to our imaginationwithout having an individual to empathize with, we're not put in any character's shoes and think with the given information. The number of supporting cast is massive. It's understandable that numerous victims are needed to tell this story, but do we really need to know about their lives in so much detail in 22-episode series? It gets extremely confusing when you try to remember all their names, occupations, character relations etc as they are introduced via built-in subtitles one after another. Similarly, there was no need to show the actual dates, especially the rokuyou (six-day week for superstitious fortune) when there seemed to be no correlation between day of week and the murders (or anything else). The information overload makes it impossible to keep track of the dates anyway.\\n\\n\r\nConfusing and flawed as it was, the first half of the story was extremely gripping with excellent pacing and suspenseful, haunting images of innocent villagers being ravaged by evil Shiki. There was an abrupt change in direction when enough villagers were converted into Shiki. They were shown with a sympathetic tone because they retain the human memory and need to drink human blood to survive... what? Yeah, that makes no sense. So here we are, after about five hours of cold-blooded, merciless murders and planning for a countermeasure against them, we're suddenly supposed to feel sorry for them? Presentation aside, the logic is flawed since that would mean human beings also have the right to survive by stopping other species that pose as threats. 'Shiki' was filled with plot holes throughout the series from odd character motivations and behaviors:\\n\\n\r\n- Shiki's plan of taking over the village makes no sense to begin with. What would they eat if the entire population turned into Shiki? The logical approach to handling okiagari should be immediate elimination rather than assistance to maintain sustainable food supply and reduce the risk of discovery.\\n\r\n- Why does none of the underling Shiki just hop on a bus and skip town rather than being a slave to their pointless cause against their will? They talk about how Shiki need a safe place to stay during daytime so they can't leave village, but all they need to do is find a random house and bite everyone inside for mind control.\\n\r\n- Yuuki Natsuno's father took down all the crosses and charms because he didn't believe in superstition, Natsuno just gives up? His life was very much at stake, he wouldn't even plead for reason or at least try putting them up again and hope his father wouldn't find out?\\n\r\n- Ozaki Toshio, the village doctor who was willing to violate all the medical codes of ethics to record the video of experiments on his wife, who turned into Shiki. That was the end game, a conclusive evidence that can prove Shiki, not a pandemic that caused the deaths. He could've sent the copies to the SDF, the police, TV stations, weekly magazine publishers, medical research centers, and pharmaceutical companies, and at least one of them would've taken the bait and investigate. To keep the plot going, he did absolutely nothing with it, he even had the chance to show it to the guys at the bar, but just gives up after he finds out they're unwilling to believe... I'm sure a video footage of a woman instantly healing from incision, and being injected with pesticide would've changed their minds. Isn't that why he recorded the whole thing in the first place?\\n\r\n- Then we have Seishin Muroi. This guy is such a joke. He refuses to help the doctor hunt down Shiki because tired of seeing people getting hurt, yet goes to assist the mutant specie born for murder? He preaches how no one death is more tragic than another... how does that justify the death of his family and the thousands Sunako will directly or indirectly kill in the future when he prevents villagers from killing her? What a hypocrite, he even kills the liquor store guy with his own hands. ??? Please get out of the way or kill yourself if you're tired of seeing deaths, don't become a menace to mankind. He must have been mentally ill.\\n\\n\r\nPeople do make momentary poor judgements in real life, and that's shown well in the series where a guy says hi to Megumi, and then realizes she should've been dead already and gets bitten, or when Natsuno's father lets a school girl (what was her deal anyway? She pretty much disappeared after that) in, and instantly felt like he's made a grave mistake. It shows how dangerous Shiki were, and a moment of carelessness can lead to deadly consequences. Unfortunately, there are all these people acting against their motivation for a prolonged period of time. These people are usually either retarded or suffering from mental illnesses in real life. When a story contains many sane characters behaving this way, it's poor storywriting.\\n\\n\r\nThe last quarter of the series is where the producers give up and spit in our faces. From the direction of the story, it was apparent that the Shiki would eventually become the hunted, and sure enough, as soon as their existence became known, all hell breaks loose, and the slaughter of Shiki begins. It gets so violent, it's comical... bloody rice ball break after smashing vampire hearts, anyone? Now all the Shiki need to die in the most horrible ways possible, by people who were closest to them before. Never mind the fact that Megumi was on foot, she needs to cross the highway in the most heavily guarded section into an ambush. Masao couldn't find a safe place to hide, about to pass out in the river bank, and talks about how Megumi would've survived if she was with him (??? she would've been dying with him?). Apparently turning into Shiki retains their memory, but reduces their IQ to a single digit. How do we kill the werewolves? Natsuno pulls out a dynamite (lol?) and takes down another with him. We can't let Sunako die. Let's expect the audience to feel sorry for a vampire who already lived over 200 years without aging and killed thousands... This alone ruined the Shiki's enigma and monstrosity built up in the first half.\\n\\n\r\n'Shiki' does question us with many philosophical and ethical dilemmas, such the value of one life over another, survival by sacrificing other lives, various morality issues, denial of the inconceivable, leaving problems for others to solve, and human being being more inhumane than monsters in times of panic. Unfortunately, all these arguments are very common in anime and other forms of storytelling, and the lazy storywriting made it impossible to take it seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this series is horrible beyond comprehension. The easiest yet the most crucial aspect of the visuals is to conform with the story. This is clearly a mystery/horror/gore series, yet the guys seem like they're princes taken out of a shoujo romance, and girls taken out of ecchi slapstick harem. They don't even match the premise of a small rural town. Sure, Yuuki Natsuno, Shimizu Megumi, and the vampires should seem out of place due to their backgrounds and personality, but you're doing it wrong when nobody seems to belong to the village. Then you have ridiculous hair designs like girl's hair bending in impossible directions and guy's looking like Medusa, Tatsumi's nekomimi, Masao looking like a transvestite, and Atsushi looking like Kinnikuman. Just what were they trying to do? I admit the level of background detail, direction, and camera movement/angle, surreality of Shiki in early episodes were done extremely well, but you can't just pack the visuals with fancy technicals, then completely botch the fundamentals. The art in this series is by far the worst I've seen this season. It's weird, but not outrageous enough to seem like an original style, the character proportions are off, in addition being poor fit with the story, premise, and even the background art. Everything just seemed off.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds were the only positive thing about this series. Yuuki Aoi was incredible as Kirishiki Sunako with the soft-spoken creepiness, but at the same time emotional when needed. Tomatsu Haruka performed very well as Shimizu Megumi as well. The unique voice of Gackt was wasted on a character who barely appeared. Everyone else mostly sounded like they should.\\n\r\nBGM really builds up the suspense, and flows pretty well with the story.\\n\r\nOP1 had extremely high audio-visual synchronization with the animation flowing perfectly with the sound. OP2 was a really catchy song that had extremely high lyric-visual/story relevance, with animation or an aspect of the story matching every single verse sang. ED1 did not really fit the series, and ED2 was an average rock song.\\n\\n\r\n'Shiki' is the first series I've seen since 'Higurashi no Naku Koro ni' that really sends chills down my spine with the creepy, surreal images and violence that didn't hold anything back. Shiki as orthodox vampires with all the classical characteristics were also a nice change. I really wanted to enjoy this series, but the second half was so poorly written and rushed, that I could no longer keep my minds off the obvious plot holes. The story development leaves a lot to our imagination, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it gets annoying when they start using it to justify lazy storywriting.",

            "content": "A little girl stumbles through the woods, her path lit by encroaching flames, her merciless pursuers intending to serve as both judge and executioner. She is fully aware of her own guilt but she runs just the same. The temple offers no divine intervention to atone for her sins, nor sanctuary from impending judgment. The very walls themselves are not safe from the inferno.\r\nShiki is the story of the inhabitants of a small town struggling to withstand ruin, both of body and soul. It does not portray an idyllic village only shattered by the arrival of the shiki (more commonly known as vampires), but anormal town with as many members already possessed of such human qualities as jealousy, snobbery, resentment, rejection, and the tendency to gossip as those of kindness and decency. The extraordinary circumstances simply draw out what these people are already made of.\\n\\n\r\nThe metamorphosis of this town begs the question, What would have happened had all this horror never come to pass? Would the members of this village have led peaceful, fulfilling lives despite their ordinary faults? Probably very few of them would have known that their neighbor, their husband, their daughter, or even they themselves might be capable of such horrors. They would have gone on loving, hating, hurting, and forgiving each other trivial matters throughout their day-to-day lives without ever knowing what monsters might lurk beneath their skin. The slow infiltration of the Shiki within their society puts each one to the test in its own way, though the paths of some, as is the case with fickle reality, are easier than others.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a difficult task in any story to cause the audience to sympathize with the antagonistic side of the conflict. Any attempt to do so can easily come across as a shallow, saccharine effort to defend horrendous acts on account of special circumstances or tragedy, usually on the part of writers who have doubtless never experienced such horrors. However, Shiki manages to tell its story impartially by refusing to choose a specific lead to serve as a moral compass for the series, instead portraying each character\u2019s motivation, choice, and action from its owner\u2019s perspective, with all their convolution and next to none purely innocent. Shiki does not tell you how to feel, and there is no hero from whose reactions the audience can take its cue. It demonstrates any moral questions it might pose rather than asking them in some cryptic dialogue, and no attempt is made to fully answer.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, for all its impartiality, Shiki is anything but dispassionate. Never forgetting or neglecting any character\u2019s pity or horror inducing moments, each one is given weight suitable to its level of grotesque and tragedy. This is aided by the soulful orchestral themes of the series. Although there are really only one or two of these that play throughout the soundtrack, each version is varied in its tone and level of passion. There are moments in which the main theme is played in such a way that it emulates a music box, speaking of lost innocence and childhood. \\n\\n\r\nBeing a horror story, Shiki has its share of graphic images and creepy moments, often accompanied by a chilling, wordless vocal solo, but it moves slowly enough to allow you to grasp what you are seeing, perhaps too fully, causing dismay more effectively and subtly than jump scares. However, it is the circumstances of such horrors that bring about more distress than the actual images or creepiness itself. Family members and friends pitted against each other and the seemingly most kindhearted of people driven to heinous acts lend far more power to the bared fangs, voided eyes, and bloody stakes than these things innately possess. Furthermore, Shiki refrains from excessive or gaudy displays of gore, with hardly any to speak of until the final episodes of the series, by which time it has earned its right to the ensuing bloodbath.\\n\\n\r\nNot only this, but Shiki has a bit of fun with its horror elements. Although the show takes itself seriously, it does dabble in the impish, especially in certain pieces of the soundtrack, which have a devilish pleasure and beat. Not all evil acts are committed in sobriety or shame, and certain characters often crack a smile or take a caper when circumstances allow. Although one such character is portrayed with almost cartoony selfishness, this tone is generally used in moderation and is effective in dispelling a bit of the series\u2019 heavy tone at proper moments.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the series sports creative and somewhat goofy character designs. Their hair stands up stiffly in completely unnatural shapes, retaining its rigid form for the most part even as it blows in the wind. The humans\u2019 eyes give a weird and sinister impression with a ring of lighter color between the pupil and an outer circle of darkness, emulating those of the Shiki, which are black but for a thin red line surrounding the center. This coupled with their crazy hairdos and overly angular faces adds to the overall otherworldliness and creepiness of the series.\\n\\n\r\nShiki is incredibly slow-moving, with the advance of calamity gradual. During the first seven episodes, the characters are oblivious to what is obvious to the audience. As frustrating as this might seem, it is realistic in that no ordinary person would accept the possibility of the existence of vampires without plenty of plausible proof. And even once some have accepted this reality, it would take a great deal to convince others, and so many things must be done and tried before any counterattack can be made.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, throughout all this realistic delay, the series never loses focus. While many anime tend to lose their way toward the ending, often with the introduction of some new element that causes the conclusion to feel disconnected from the start, this is not the case with Shiki. Each slow and detailed episode that came before provides support for the finale, which more than delivers as every character, forced to face the choices they have made, grapples with their fate.",

            "content": "Until maybe a decade ago vampire stories were at their prime. I, as well, used to be a big fan of such stories. In my eyes, those tales were thrilling, grasping me the whole way through and leaving me mostly utterly terrified. After hundreds of movies, books and tv series based on the vampire myth,though, vampires started to lose their original shine. They were just so overused that one could easily stop caring anymore. If anyone of you came asking me what I believed a vampire was I\u2019m not quite sure of what my answer would be. Can they die from sunlight or do theyglitter like the sun? Are they really fearsome or do they look like they just came out of a beauty pageant? Questions like these, that many of you might have, at one point, thought, made me stop watching about vampires whatsoever. And then came Shiki, taking the vampire story onto a whole new level, returning them back to their former days of glory.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nI think the true success of Shiki\u2019s story is the fact that this time such a tale was told through the eyes of Japanese creators, making it effective in two particular ways. First, it was a fresh approach of a legend that belonged to different cultures than theirs, so that automatically helped the creators move off the beaten track. And then comes the slight mix with their own traditional myths of the \u201cOkiagari\u201d, which literally means the Risen. \\n\r\nVampires in this show are just as they should be, afraid of light, can\u2019t come out in the day without burning themselves, they don\u2019t like holly water, charms and crosses, they drink the blood of their victims after completely hypnotizing them and they don\u2019t fall in love with them..*ahem*\\n\r\nThey also can\u2019t enter a house uninvited. Then again, they have everything that a traditional vampire would be proud of, in addition to the so well know wooden stick killing method, that in contrary they so much loathe.\\n\\n\r\nThe myth of the undead, blood thirsty killers, this time, unfolds in a quiet, isolated village and at first look, common village, were sudden disappearances start to occur after a strange family moves in to the big mansion on the mountain. A few people are becoming aware of something out of the usual going on and that is how it all starts moving.\\n\r\nAt first the story runs slow, just as the unaware victims continue to carry on their daily lives. So the pacing of the first part of the series might throw some of the viewers off, especially those who are fans of full time action. Well, how I saw things, this choice of pacing was indeed a clever one, not throwing the viewer into the middle of an already unfolded story, but slowly and steadily shroud him into its mystery. As it rolls, you will find yourself entangled in it, with questions that you just need to find the answers for, doubts about the actions and choices of some of the characters and some very clever twists here and there to spice up your viewing experience.\\n\r\nWhat I love about this show\u2019s story is that it isn\u2019t focused on the events around only one or a small group of characters, but it rather expands itself to cover the events on the whole village and its people and view the story from both sides, both the humans and the Okiagari. So, that will help you get a feel of the broader plan of what is going on. Yes, it\u2019s quite common to expect the endless battle of humans versus vampires, but this time you get to see both sides. In fact, you might be even puzzled about actually labeling what is wrong and right, bad and good, from some point on. It\u2019s a fight for survival, after all, and each side naturally decides in favor of their own kind.\\n\\n\r\n~~ \u53cb\u5f15 \u2013 Tomobiki  Good luck, except at noon~~\\n\r\nA thing that\u2019s fascinating about the story, which shows the effort of the creators, is this small detail of the dates shown at the start of each episode, that is crucial though for one to complete the puzzle. Until the 19th century Japan used a lunar calendar of six days, each having a special meaning of bringing luck or misfortune. Shiki uses this in each episode to determine what the nature of this day is, usually foreshadowing the events to follow.\\n\\n\r\nShiki always loves cliff hangers in the ending of each episode, so you will find yourselves trapped in a roller coaster viewing ride, which will be getting more and more intense until it reaches its peak. But when starting watching, you\u2019re nowhere around guessing what would come out of all this in the very end. \\n\r\nI will admit that some of its final conclusions weren\u2019t so satisfactory to me, a few things felt abruptly wrapped up, so only there, is where I deduct a point, because the ending is very crucial to me. But, of course, it always depends on what everyone expects to find as a final resolution. So all in all it was one of the most intense anime rides I\u2019ve ever been on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I loved about this show was its characters. Oh, they were plenty of them, and all so versatile. One can never get bored watching this, since you will find all type of characters, and you can easily pick one or two with whom you maybe will relate and follow throughout the story. A lot of people are accusing Shiki of shallow characters. My answer to them is that not every story created should be character driven, and this isn\u2019t a story about teenage angst or a forbidden romance. You know were you got yourself into beforehand, am I wrong? So if you prefer stories focused on one character only, don't watch this.\\n\\n\r\nTo the rest, you've made a good choise, since you\u2019ll find yourselves in front of many familiar types of characters, not in terms of anime norms, but relating to real life-types of people. And you won\u2019t be the least disappointed about the depths of their personalities, despite the big number of characters existing in the show.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhat a wonderful day! No one in the village doing anything.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nNow, I don\u2019t know if some of you might have an experience of living or even staying for a while in a small village. If you do, as I have in my vacations, then you would recognize some types of people in Shiki. \\n\r\nThere are the small minded people that can\u2019t compromise with thinking outside their little shells, focusing their lives entirely on their daily village routines, forgetting about the rest of the world. There are the gossipers, who of course want to know every single news of the village, since the news isn\u2019t many anyway. There are the usual working people, who just do their jobs quietly each day. And there are also those who sit around in a chair doing nothing but watch the passers by and chit chat about mindless things. You can also find kids that want to escape this narrowed life experience and make their way to the big city and also a priest and a doctor who both try to find their own way to balance the life in the village.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the events of bizarre deaths start to unfold, everyone will act differently according to their character and beliefs, and that is what\u2019s the most fascinating about them. You\u2019ll see bravery, stupidity, cunningness, understanding, fighters and whiners, some even getting advantage of the whole thing. Generally you\u2019ll find many approaches and that is what makes the characters so enriched. Concerning most of them, you will never really learn any solid background information, and yet they feel so fleshed out and real. For a story driven show this is definitely a success.\\n\r\nAlso, don\u2019t forget that you\u2019ll get to know, many of the opposing threat side of characters, the Shikis, as they all have their own unique personality to show. Being the supposedly \u201cbad guys\u201d who everyone fears, doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be diverse.\\n\r\nAll in all I\u2019m more than satisfied from this show\u2019s variety of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe only point I deducted from this section is because of the use of some of them by the creators. I felt that characters like Natsuno, Megumi, Masao and a few others, could have been involved a little more in certain points of the story. They still are there and active, but they didn\u2019t intertwine with each other as much as I hoped to.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, Animation: 10\\n\\n\r\nNow this is, mostly, the section were haters of the show focus their flaming on. I won\u2019t try to persuade anyone that what I see is more right than what they see. But then noone can try to change my way of experiencing things, respectively. That needed to be said, before I say that I found the art and animation both to be brilliant!\\n\\n\r\nThe art is indeed unique. I am not trying to play it cool saying that.\\n\r\nUnique and different doesn\u2019t always mean it\u2019s good. If those same looking characters were dragged and dropped into any other type of show I would at least thought the people making it tasteless. But not in this case! \\n\r\nThe people who designed the characters knew exactly what they were doing. The faces have rough angles and the shape of their characteristics is unproportional. The hair is also so crazy that stands out from miles away. They all are like a weird cubistic imitation of some of Picasso\u2019s craziest paintings. But were other people find this unattractive, here is exactly how this fact elevates the story. This specific oddity makes Shiki stand out, looking like an old creepy fairytail that comes out of a dusty old book or from one of those bedtime stories that a grandma used to tell her grandchildren around the fireplace. They remind me of Tim Burton\u2019s seductive dark style and where could it fit better than in a story about vampires? \\n\\n\r\nVampires are anything but usual, they are extravagant, they are lavish but they are also fearsome and killers. So, the roughnesses of the sketches as well as the crazy colors depict the wildness of the story itself. Also the eyes of the Okiagari that don\u2019t have pupils make it feel like you are looking inside an empty shell, as referring to them not having a human soul anymore. The backgrounds are drawn very nicely making this look really to be this enclosed village that the story describes, one that is far from civilization. \\n\r\nA small detail I found very beautiful is the part where the eyes of the Shiki were glowing red in the night and then their shadow slowly appeared, making it very creepy to watch.\\n\r\nThe animation is equally good. Some movements may seem abrupt, but I think it adds more to the roughness of the story better than having gentle moves that create a smooth flow. So I really don\u2019t find anything wrong with the animation being more rough than usual.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic and Sound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe music section is many times the most neglected in a series. As a big music lover, I hate it when, otherwise good shows, have some lame BG music and sound to support them. Sometimes I do find one or good Opening and Ending themes that stand alone though, because usually the background music of those series keeps me indifferent. \\n\r\nIn Shiki though, the music is so brilliant that I don\u2019t know where to start the praise from. The melodies aren\u2019t just pretty or simply fit well, they are one with the show, the same entity. They blend so perfectly in each frame and time of the show that I\u2019m positive Shiki wouldn\u2019t be the same without its music score. \\n\r\nThe first OP is mysterious, seductive, special. The second OP is eerie, magical, like a dark lament. The endings are equally seductive, particularly the second one that reminds me of music of past decades, having a passionate and also sorrowful sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is equally awe-striking, it\u2019s sometimes playful, sometimes harsh, others soft or sending chills down your spine. The various tracks use from natural sounds to human voices. Some voices sound like a jukebox, others chanting or making creepy but melodic sounds. Each and every single piece used, elevates the show.\\n\r\nAs far as the voice acting is concerned, I saw a few new actors involved in this, which I find good for a change. They all did their work marvelously well, projecting each of the character\u2019s unique personality. And then they went through many phases, having to show pain, anger, fear, scream or whisper. They all had a hard job, but pulled it off perfectly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nMany times during a show I find myself indifferent about what is going on with the story and the characters. Some stories manage to grab my attention back again, but usually I always experience one or two times of boredom that I just have to be patient until the good parts come in. Not with Shiki. Every time I started watching this I felt like I was glued to my screen, completely forgetting what was going on in my surroundings or how did I end up watching this at those late hours, hearing and watching nothing else but the show itself. I found myself so concerned about everyone\u2019s fate, the art and music working like a magnet on me, that I just wanted this to go on and on as much as it was possible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 - 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who love intense experiences and look for a little more thought provoking shows Shiki will come as a real treat. It will keep you excited, at the edge of your seat, and at the same time it will make you the player of a big puzzle were you have to be very careful on what you see to finally create the whole image. What is equally cool about the whole viewing experience is that there are so many point of views from which you can observe this show that I\u2019m sure that watching it a second time you\u2019ll come up with different notes about it. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you love vampires or just love to watch a little deeper emotionally shows with a complete lack of pantie shots and silly fanservice, then this is exactly the show you\u2019re looking for. A traditional, creepy, mystical, magical, dark, haunting and twisted fairytale. So just grab a mug of hot milk and join us near the fireplace.\\n\r\nHave a nice and creepy ride! :)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks to everyone for reading this relatively long review. Please feel free to leave a comment on my channel with your thoughts about it or about the show.\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nShiki is an unusual anime. This is an anime that tries to tell a very Western style vampire story, but set it in a small Japanese village. The entire first episode follows this obnoxious, bratty girl that it wants the viewer to think is the main character...then kills her off. In fact, there is no one main character. You see things from the perspective of several characters on the human side and several on the vampire side. It is up the viewer to determine which side they sympathize with and want to root for.\r\nHorror factor:\r\nShiki is first and foremost a horror anime, so is itscary? Honestly the answer is no. Not in the slightest. Shiki lacks the atmosphere, psychology, and pacing to be actually creepy. It doesn't have effective jump scares. Even the 10 year old girls that scream in every Paranormal Activity movie or \"The Bye Bye Man\" wouldn't be scared by Shiki. Instead, Shiki has a sort of cheesy charm to it that reminds me of the old Hammer Dracula films. Sadly, it doesn't have Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee to carry a lackluster script. \\n\\n\r\nAddiction factor:\\n\\n\r\nWhat Shiki DOES have going for it, is that it is compulsively watchable. You end one episode and just have to see what happens next. Even though I disliked most of the characters and I wasn't a huge fan of the series, I just couldn't put it down. That's actually a skill to make your series so addicting and Shiki pulls it off. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory and characters: (SPOILERS if you haven't seen Shiki and are interested!) \\n\\n\r\nPeople are just dying in droves in a small Japanese village and a local doctor named Toshio Ozaki must solve the mystery. Ozaki is our Abraham Van Helsing stand in and is by FAR the most likeable character in the series. The vampire faction is being led by Sunako, who takes the appearance of a little girl, but is actually centuries old. Sunako plans to wipe out a village of around 3,000 people and turn several hundred of them into vampires. She wishes to establish a paradise for vampires where they don't have to live in fear of human reprisal. Shiki is a 24 episode battle between these factions and viewers are often fiercely divided between them. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with Shiki is that it tries SO hard to emotionally make viewers sympathize with the vampires, but gives no logical reason for doing so. The vampire faction's plan is bullshit and is horribly thought out. I know I'm not the first reviewer to say this, but it's SO true. There are a few higher vampires called \"Jinrou\" who are able to eat normal food and survive in sunlight. Over 95% of vampires including their leader Sunako, must eat around 1 human victim a week in order to not starve to death. They are shown drinking glasses of blood, so apparently they COULD survive on medical blood, but Sunako has no consideration for human lives. Sunako's village won't be able to just live in peace, free of human discrimination. If you establish a village of 300 vampires, they will require roughly 15,600 new human victims to not starve to death in just the first year. In Shiki, roughly 10 percent of all vampire victims come back as vampires. That means the first year will produce 1,560 new vampires. In order to survive just the 2nd year, the vampire town would require 96,720 new human victims. The problem snowballs from there and keep in mind the vampires are  immortal with infinite life expectancy, so they require infinite resources. Sunako's \"plan\" is completely unsustainable and would wipe out all of Humanity and thus all vampires as well within just 50 years. One vampire is moral and desides to starve to death rather than eat humans. However, the other vampires make the decision that their own lives are worth an infinite number of human lives to sustain. Since they still have free will and voluntarily make such a selfish decision, it is unarguable that every vampire displayed  in this series deserves to be staked. \\n\\n\r\nThe series ends with the worst character in the anime, a human monk turned Jinrou Vampire, saving the life of Sunako by killing the villager that was finally going to put an end to her. Even Sunako was willing to admit her fault and face death, but the Monk convinces her that a righteous God would never allow vampires to exist. Since God must not exist, there is no evil in the world and everything is permitted. I hate you shitty anime Smerdyakov. I hate you SO fucking much. The worst vampire leader ever flees into the woods with bootleg Smerdyakov to kill more people and start this whole saga again. The village burns during the final battle, so Dr. Okazaki stares off and wonders if it was all worth it. YES! Are you fucking kidding me!? Saving humanity is worth one small town burning down. What kind of a philosophical question is that?!\\n\\n\r\nLets look at another vampire series that did this plot WAY better. There is a manga called Dance of the Vampire Bund. The vampire leader is a many centuries old \"little girl\" just like Sunako. However, Mina Tepes is a strategic mastermind whose plan to establish a vampire utopia actually makes sense. Using hundreds of years of medical knowledge, her scientists create an artificial blood that can be mass produced. The vampire population is kept strictly in check so that they don't over consume resources. She uses 800 years of stored treasure and compound interest to amass an absurd fortune that she uses to bribe politicians and create an ultra influential lobbying force. Her plan is fully sustainable and meticulously calculated. She is not a moral paragon, but due to her intelligence and not simply being evil, there is no reason for human readers not to sympathize with her and support her. Mina would impale Sunako and all of the Shiki in this series for being idiots and bringing human wrath down on vampires. She would be absolutely right to do so. \\n\\n\r\nArt and music:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fine considering this was a 24 episode anime made on a budget by a small studio called Daume. Even larger studios often see the budget stretched by a 24 episode run time. For a small studio to pull this off without the animation going to total diarrhea by the last quarter of the series, is actually impressive. Toei would have fucked this up. Those guys simply can't go more than 13 episodes and have it not be a visual disaster.  The music is fine. It's the lady that did all the music for Naruto and Fairy Tail. She's not my absolute favorite of all time, but she's pretty good. Look at it this way. If she was a bad composer, she wouldn't get hired to score the most popular and lucrative anime in existence. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nShiki is an anime that grabbed my attention and held onto me...even as it careened over a cliff. At the end of the day, Shiki just isn't a good anime in my book. However, it isn't simply a horrible anime. It does enough things right that it deserves at least an average rating. I've seen so many bad anime that I've learned to appreciate basic competence and reward it when I see it. If you loved \"Let the Right One In\", own 5 Hammer Dracula movies, and REALLY want to see a Western Vampire anime, you could do worse.\\n\\n",

Nevertheless I think that even if you didn't see this anime, you will still be able to see it.\r\nThe huge good point on this anime is it's art.

After a suspicion based on global belief (Vampire exists) and a diagnostic based on global belief (Vampire is dead and don't breath), the family is found innocent.  What is unbelievable is that they suspect after month and amount of weird deaths and they give up just because only one diagnostic. Sudden death are started since the family arrive and the village didn't immediately suspect the family. It could be written on the family house \"We are the guilty\", they won't believe (a whole village completely stupid, I think they should all die, and at least the anime should be really more psychological).\\n\\n\r\nThe way they discover the cause of death a BIG JOKE. It's serious ? They have all the clue to think that the death seems to be caused by vampire and they find it just in asking the question ? As same, the dead could write \"A vampire kills me\" they won't believe it. The vampire don't even try to hide the cause of death.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is just a fight between 2 stupid camps.\\n",

            "content": "There's a certain degree of information that I will have to keep to myself based on your decision of how much would you like to know about Shiki before going into it. But to properly review and describe most gripes I have with the series, I'll have to go really deep into the series. So I'll classify this review in parts. At the start there will be no spoilers and I'll explain beforehand why that is.\r\nTo sum up everything I'll say: \r\n- As a mystery it won't work because what is happening is revealed in the fourth episode. Also because the series is really easyto spoil on the whole mystery aspect\\n\r\n- As a thriller the series has too much momentum and while it takes its time to get where it gets, it never focuses on things in the same way a slow paced thriller would, making sure you understand every possible viewpoint beforehand.\\n\r\n- As a drama, it plainly doesn't work, because the characters are impractical in their action, their sense of morality is almost cartoonish, and any semblance of competence in the writing gets fucked by the end.\\n\r\n- As a horror, it's a bit more subjective, but I wasn't really actually scared and thought that it felt more edgy than disturbing. Blood, disturbing imagery and some gore. Not really anything lacking outside of the horror genre. It's just amplified.\\n\\n\r\nNow very important, if you want to go completely blind into Shiki, you should really avoid reading anything about it on its MAL page, and I do really mean everything. There's really high odds that if you visit the page for Shiki that you will know exactly what the mystery aspect of it entails, and will then have little to no appreciation for it from that side of things. It doesn't last a really long while, and by the 3rd to 4th episode, you can probably figure out exactly what is going on your own, even if you barely paid attention, point at which the mystery is revealed. But it does put some focus on it early. I wouldn't value Shiki as a mystery anime personally, as it isn't designed with that goal in mind. \\n\\n\r\nAnd let me warn you that you shouldn't really treat this anime as a thriller either.  A thriller builds suspense and doesn't really have momentum, as it will progress slowly and let you take in the whole situation from every important perspective you could go for. However, this anime keeps running forward with the essential of what you need and never really takes a break. If you dislike or enjoy thrillers, make of this what you will.\\n\\n\r\nNow let me give you a rundown on the things you CAN know beforehand and still maintain the mystery intact, by giving you the same level of information the characters know collectively. There's an epidemic that makes characters die of anemia, that presents with very mild symptoms early. The characters start acting strange upon contracting the symptoms as they will sabotage themselves from getting treatment for it. The anime focuses on how the village tackles this new disease and what decisions they make from a moral standpoint to tackle said disease.\\n\\n\r\nNow at the point in the anime where the mystery is alive and the audience wasn't confirmed on any of their suspicions, the anime is a little campy, but is otherwise fine. It does seem tropey, with characters making stupid decisions such as not contacting the government about the epidemic or getting any autopsies, which is a common horror thing, where the characters are like, yeah, we can deal with this. Besides their decisions, some of the characters that have focus put on them are appalling to say the least. One of the main characters we have is an edgelord that wants to avoid having friends and leave the place he lives because he hates the country side. He doesn't want any sort of attention, doesn't seem to like anything, but somehow he seems to be widely liked by most people he goes into contact with. His name is Yuki. And this Yuki also has a Yuno, a pink haired stalker that also hates where she lives because people don't like fashion and has a crush on him mostly because he's from the city, probably. There's also a priest that can't say no to lolies and wanted to kill himself once, and some doctor that is a doctor and a bestfriend type character who's personality is that he's your best friend. There isn't really much depth to the characters, some would classify this anime as horror. I wouldn't, I would classify it as E D G E, but I can't detail it in this section quite accurately.\\n\\n\r\nThe nitty gritty is the fact that it deals a great deal with morality, on decisions that aren't exactly immoral since they mostly concern survival. There are degrees where people get really fucked up at points in terms of morals to a very ridiculous degree that it becomes hilarious and tragic at the same time. But again I can't detail this due to spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch the anime for the mystery aspect of it, I need you to be aware of the fact that it is short lived and it doesn't really last for a very long period of the anime. You will understand what's happening before the characters do. The mystery should be somewhat interesting but the overarching story details revolve on you knowing exactly what's going on, so the story doesn't truly start until you learn what is going on. The mystery is merely the set up, and that is all I can give you thus far, with some details about who the characters were. It's merely the setup, there isn't really anything wrong with the setup, and outside everyone's reluctance and stupidity of not wanting to accept outside help, there isn't anything wrong with the anime at this point, unless, like me, you'd think the characters are cardboard. I don't think this anime would be a good choice for you as a mystery, as it is merely there to add spice to what is going on in the story at that moment. And besides that, it isn't something hard to figure out, as there are enough details to figure out what's actually happening in the first few episodes, and very shortly after, the jig is up. If the air of mystery is what you demand in this story, stop reading after this paragraph, as you know the essential information you need about the early story, and I've already said my piece on whether or not the mystery part is essential. My recommendation is avoid Shiki if the mystery aspect is the most quintessential part of the story for you since it's shortlived.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 From this point on, I'll talk about details after the mystery. (contains non-plot specific spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nOk, now that I can speak more freely, the story is about a bunch of vampires trying to suck off all the villagers, so they could turn the village into their nest. Progressively, we learn more details about how they work and what is happening overall, and the series focuses on the struggles of the doctor and the guy that I said displays only edginess and is rewarded only affection. Now until the point there are flaws on how the world of the anime treat everything. The government somehow didn't notice a major spike in deaths despite death certificates being made, and although there is an explanation done later for that, it doesn't solve the problem before it started being one. There are also lack of autopsies done on the corpses of these people like that isn't even a choice, and was only brought up once and refused. You see, one way the series tries to justify it, is that vampires have a hypnotic effect on the people they end up biting. However, this hypnotic effect only works on who they have had bitten, and they haven't bitten the family members or the remaining people who wouldn't even have a say in the matter, especially if they were the last person in that family to die. The village also tries to claim that they can't really communicate with the government anymore, at some point, but all you have to do is use a car and fuck off, or maybe use a fucking phone. You can still get help from the outside. And if they chose to, this whole story would've been very different. The plot really goes through hurdles to try and justify why it is still going in the direction it is going, because the vampires wouldn't have a convenient setup. And there is one point where one of the characters says \"I'm sorry x, but we can't think that way due to modern rationalism.\" which is the most artificial way to present disbelief ever. That's the same as making a character say \"that person is no longer capable of placing one foot in front of the other in a repeated fashion in over to travel large distances in a fast motion\" when they notice a guy got tired of running. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of writing the series has a few positives but eventually the series devolves into a cynical outlook on human cruelty, which I can't give much details on because that goes into late game spoilers. But it mostly stems out of the fact that is it immoral that they kill to eat? But when you really think about it, the series asks whether or not it is right to kill to survive? But you can see it is impossible to survive without killing by simply drinking a glass of blood, which is given as a choice. You see, the show is very hypocritical of the humans, but very lenient on the vampires, even if some of them act like serial killers that pick only a type of person they suck blood from sadistically, having a specific MO of killing. If you went to hunt, and shot a deer, and as it lay there dying and scared, you should proceed to stomp the fuck out of it rather than mercy kill it, you're a fucking dickbag. A lot of the vampires act exactly like that and the series treats human as needlessly cruel and the vampires as an endangered species at points, being really forgiving of the cruel acts done by the vampires and very lenient of the \"misdeeds\" of the humans. This will somehow get worse at one point, but I can't go into detail then, where neither side will be remotely believable anymore. There are still some decent moments that do deal with morality, which is why I claim that the cruelty in it is very cynical, it's not that I think the writer is incapable, but rather that he was terribly cynical and has forsaken the possible nuance the characters could have.\\n\\n\r\nAny depth they could have was done over with the simplfication of how unconflicted they would be in morally grey situations. Which wasn't the case for the entirety of the series and there are some characters that still have some duality to who they are, even by the end, but they are few and far between and most characters act cartoonishly and very simplistic. Basically they're a collective conciousness. Which completely fucks everything, because the moral dillema the series poses becomes very flawed. It's not that you should root for both sides, neither side, one side or the other. It's that you can't be in the moral highground if you do for either. It's that the sides aren't consistent to what they want and act against their own moral preachings and don't think practically to any degree. Anyway, this is as far as I will go about morality. I can only be vague as to spoil you and have merely given you a clue about the direction the series will take through this. I'd talk about a few characters that succeed as an arc, but those are the good part of the series that I'd rather you go on with them unspoiled.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can tackle the problems I've described with the series going in, then you should be safe. But in my case, not only were the characters impractical, but they also became wildly irrational, and I ended up disagreeing with everyone's sense of morality. And this made it feel really edge. Horrifying for the point of being horrifying. Cruel for the sake of being cruel. This whole situation they've been through could be solvable in a wild variety of ways that could've solved things for everyone. The events were avoidable and the characters were unbearable. The story simply became unsatisfying and just some animated gore and some disturbing visuals aren't enough to horrify or entertain me. I could describe what exactly the moral dillema was, but that's a spoiler so I'm sorry if I'm being vague, bbut I will give more details later in the review if you decide you are willing to sit through more spoilery information or just have given up on the idea of watching the series.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, I think you should watch this show if you really want to see edge, because it's filled to the brim with it. The main character is edgy, the moral dillemas are often edgy. And it gets ridiculously so after a certain point. Even so, it will take a long time to get to metallingus edgimus maximus, and will even have some good questionable grey morality outlines at some points, even if the edge will be constantly present, but don't worry, those get largely overshadowed by the end of the series. It is filled with convenient actions and consequences that feel shoehorned in. I don't advice to watch this series, as a thriller, as a drama or as a mystery but rather as an edgy vampire romp. It doesn't remotely excel in any of the things it sets out to do, and even if there are some elements that almost get there, but due to that, it might get really fun to watch because of how atrocious everything gets. Everything gets terribly written by the end, and as such, seeing everything crumble into a terrible edgefest might be what you will enjoy. The edgeparty is what will happen, but it will take its time to get there, so keep that in mind. If you want any more information, past what I've already given, you can continue reading this review, to understand what my exact problem is with the morality of the show, since you can understand how I see things as incoveniences and how I found the characters appalling due to their traits in the first part of the review. Don't read past this paragraph if you want to avoid plot specific spoilers as I will go all in & make your choice on whether to watch or avoid this series on whether or not you can enjoy hardcore edgy vampire melodrama.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 How the endgame gets fucked up (Full on plot specific spoilers from the ending of the anime and its course)\\n\\n\r\nSo, at the end of the anime, the doctor manages to prove that a vampire is a vampire and they end up killing said vampire and the villagers start a purge on them. Now the vampires and the anime itself start arguing that the villagers are evil because, unlike the vampires, they don't kill just to feed themselves, when you can simply just make the argument they are killing them so they can survive, since they were their food. If a boar kills you, when you are hunting them so you would have some food on your plate tonight, your family isn't gonna sue the boar to send it to jail because it did something immoral. It killed its hunter to survive. Same case scenario here. But note that the humans will not be without fault too. Because while they do kill the vampires because the situation kinda forces them to, they are extremely casual and horrific about it. The women will casually speak about how they are middle aged women as they are throwing piles of corpses. The men will attack any hypnotized people and kill them, despite the fact it isn't by their own choice that they take that course of action. They will throw away any morality they had and empathy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the vampires are just as annoying. Plenty of the vampires made the choice to kill sadistically and without thinking about how their victims would feel, and had no regard of whether or not they could establish a peaceful resolution. You see, there is a valid choice for a vampire to either drink blood from a glass, or suck blood from a human as an initiation right. So that is proof enough that they could probably drink blood from outside the human's body. So, if they chose, to accept blood samples from donors from the village or anywhere else in order to survive, they would have had no reason to kill. So they aren't killing in order to survive either. There are clear collaborators they could get that would be more than willing to help with the blood. Aside of that, there are vampires that do get sadistic pleasure out of their killings, and even choose an MO on who to kill, when and how and even have vendettas on certain people they used to know. And when they start acting in a manner where they are like, this is horrible and humans are horrible they become even more disgusting. \\n\\n\r\nYou see I sided with neither side because of each side's action. I could forgive incompetence from either side, but not lack of self awareness. Not feeling any sort of conflicting emotions when killing former acquaintances and relatives is something both sides are guilty of. They are both monsters. They don't have complex human emotions, they're just part of one sick twisted game that believes that is how these people would act in the given situation, without understanding how conflicted they could get in such a confrontation. That's why it became full on edge. Everyone on each side is a shitlord.\\n\\n\r\nIt is really the only thing I had left to explain. Now, as I've said formerly in the review, I'd just repeat myself, so choose wisely on whether or not to watch this series. It becomes a real edgefest at one point, and if you are looking for that, you can squeeze enjoyment out of it regardless how bad you may consider it. There's plenty of series I went into with that mindset, that I've ended up enjoying while being completely aware that are awful. If you have some of those examples yourselves, you might like Shiki despite the spoilers I gave. For me, it's far more dissapointing because Shiki had some potential to be a heavily flawed anime that still manages to be somewhat decent, but it doesn't, because it is simply far too cynical.",

            "content": "While Shiki is definitely not the best thriller anime out there, I wouldn't go as far as saying it is a complete waste of time. \r\nDespite the fact that the story is not really original (vampires and werewolves, yeah), it still manages to not be a copy/paste of others fictions (at least from the ones I know). The rule for people to \"rise\" (aka becoming a shiki) is actually a bit different from what you can usually see, and makes the plot more interesting. \r\nAlso, the characters are not that original either (or unforgivable), but they still manage to make the view more enjoyable. Thedoctor and the teenage lead are the characters you can identify the most, and both make an acceptable job to advance the story. Then, you have the bitch girl, the pathetic teen, the scared-but-decided-to-act children, the 50-year-old brute, the nice-mean-guy, the seductive succubus, the little girl a bit scary, etc. The only one I don't get is the Junior Monk, which personality and motivations are unclear from the beginning and all along the story ; but he still manages to bring something to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nI think the main problem of the anime is its pace : even if they shortened it by 5 episodes, it still would be too long. It would have been better to go for 12 episodes. Indeed, it starts ridiculously slowly, and NEVER accelerates ; consequently, the narration becomes quickly unbearable. Besides, they have the annoying habit to shelve the important facts, and sometimes you have to wait for 3 or 4 episodes to get your answer to what happened - and it's often very incomplete. \\n\r\nAnther thing I disliked is the way they want to make you sympathize with one or either side ; I know it's usual in this kind of show, but still, their arguments are so shallow that it just bores me. Yes, the shikis have to kill humans to feed and survive - yes, the humans have to defend themselves from their former friends if they want to survive too - but the way both are presented successively as monsters or as people who can't do otherwise diminishes the impact of the show. Should I remind that the point of a thriller is to scare the viewer, at at least to make him feel uneasy ? \\n\r\nWell, there are also some details that are not really explained, which is quite annoying too. \\n\\n\r\nThe last critic I would make is about the art : what the hell is wrong with their hair ? I mean, I could handle their funny (not to say ugly) faces, but the haircuts are too much. One guy literally has ears on his head, like a dog, and nobody notices a thing ! And what about the girls whose wig look like gravity doesn't exist ? Or the old guy with a beard going up ... You get used to it after 20 episodes, but it's still unsightly. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWell, I made a lot of critics, however the show is still somehow enjoyable and perfectly fulfills the job of distracting you for a few evenings. It's probably better to watch it at night (with an open window), and to not split the views too much - but don't expect too much from it either, since some parts might get you bored anyway.",

            "content": "I'll be honest; this is my first review. As so, I am open to all criticism and feedback. After all, I'm here to inform you, not fan-boy rant or spew obscenities about a show. So, without further ado, onto the review! (I promise that was not intended to rhyme!)\r\nIt's been a while since I dared to pick up a vampire anime. The modernization and romanticism of these blood-suckers in titles such as Twilight and other anime like Rosario + Vampire left me with much despair for this genre.\r\nLuckily, Shiki rekindled my appeal towards the night stalkers.\r\nAfter watching the entire series, I have to say Iwas pleasantly surprised. I went in not expecting much, and came out finding a hidden gem among anime. But, Frag, what makes this show such a gem? I'll do my best to answer that question in the following paragraphs, my dear readers!\\n\\n\r\nShiki's story starts off fairly simple. A small back-hill village that seems trapped in it's own little world. And it's because of this simplicity that the producers were able to catch the viewer off guard. Just when things seemed normal enough, there's just the smallest, slightest flash of insanity that reminds you you're watching a very mind-boggling show. As the story went on, the simplicity began to evaporate. What was left was more insanity. More horror. Shiki goes back to the roots of the vampires most older individuals remember. Burning in sunlight, fearing religious objects (such as crosses or buddha statues) and faith, coma-like sleep during the day. I don't want to say too much, for I wouldn't want to spoil anything, but I will tell you that Shiki does vampires justice after shows such as the Vampire Diaries. As the story progresses, you begin to become more enthralled within it's mysteries. Just as one mystery is figured out, more appear. It's what hooks the viewer, and it did so marvelously (I watched the entire series in one weekend.) Some people found the ending to be not what they were expecting, but I thought it matched the series as a whole perfectly; full of mystery.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen quite a number of anime's in my time, and I've really come to appreciate good art when I can get it. I find there are two categories; shows that normalize their art to fit in with other anime, and shows that shape their own style. Obviously, it's impossible to be completely unique when manga itself is a repetitive art, but there are shows that manage to create a style that works well for it. Shiki is one of those anime. Watching it in HD, the animation was incredibly fluid. The scenery was vibrant and colorful where it should of been, and dark and horrifying where it ought to be. The horror scenes are really what entranced me, however. The way that the artists conveyed the terror of being watched during the night, of wondering if you'll wake up the next morning truly enthralled me. It's been a long while since I got chills watching an anime, and Shiki delivered quite well. Major props to the art team.\\n\\n\r\nI had some mix feelings about the sound of Shiki at first. Loved the initial opening theme, but the choir and gothic music felt almost clich\u00e9 at first. Over time, however, the anime's original soundtrack really grew on me. It didn't completely \"WOW!\" me, especially at first, but as the story progressed, the music really began to fit in with the emotions that this show stirs inside of you. The ending theme, like many other anime, really didn't impress me, however. It felt out of place for the type of anime Shiki is. Overall, Shiki's soundtrack did a great job after giving it time to settle in.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what really made me adore this anime wasn't any of the above, but the characters themselves. I can't really say that there's a \"main character\" in this story, but some characters perspectives are highlighted more so than others as the show progresses. The thing about Shiki is that it hosts a massive cast; that cast being the village. You would think that spreading so much of the story throughout many characters would be a bad idea, reducing the chance the viewer can become attached to them, but Shiki manages to do quite the opposite. The key was the fact that the characters were believable. I've yet to have seen an anime (other than Clannad Afterstory) that manages to sport such realistic characters. From Megumi to Natsuno, to Toshio and Seishin; all of them feel like people I've met in my life, people that I can relate to or say I know. It's because that these characters are believable that you so quickly become attached.\\n\\n\r\nDid you enjoy Shiki, Frag? Well, if it wasn't apparent enough already, it has truly been one of my greatest pleasures of anime to watch this year. When a company can piece together all these delicate categories of anime in just the right way, it can create a genuinely memorable experience for the viewer. Shiki is an anime I'm proud to add to my collection of favorites. Something I should mention is that the show really manages to get you to think about morals. What is truly right or wrong? Is there such a thing as pure good or evil? The best part is that Shiki leaves it up to you to figure out the answers yourself.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up, I urge you to give the show a chance. Two episodes in, I was hooked, and I'm willing to bet it'll do the same to you. I'm surprised this show isn't more popular; it's a real breath of fresh air when it comes to the long neglected genre of vampires. Even if you've never been one for blood-suckers, you might find the genre more appealing after sitting down and watching Shiki.",

            "content": "Shiki is definitely one of those nice surprises you didn't expect would be so good, considering the level of uninspiring and unoriginal anime fluff we see on the shelves nowadays. Despite receiving rave reviews by so many people from all walks of life, I was still a total skeptic especially when it comes to people praising any modern anime. Mainly since there is very little modern anime has to offer... beyond titties,  panty-shots, moe, toothy grinning shounen-types with big weapons or powers, and giant robots... miraculously all within some kind of  school setting. If  you've seen one, you can basically say you'veseen them all. So imagine my surprise when i picked this title; after seeing these kids with bizarre hair and the cheery (somewhat simple) art style, I genuinely expected some type of  \"Pokemon's rendition\" of vampires. Well, I was wrong, and I'm not embarrassed to admit it. What I've learnt, is that regardless of it's appearance, there is some level of  depth and complexity to this story that will make you enjoy it a lot more than perhaps you originally intended. \\n\\n\r\nSOUNDS:\\n\r\nLet's start with the music first. I didn't like the first OP, Kuchizuke, I dunno what about it got on my nerves, maybe the howling/haunting male vocals or the fact that it fell between rock and pop. The howling voice does suit the overall creepiness of the series... but it just was not my cuppa tea. Strangely enough,  I loved the second ED theme, Gekka Reijin, which is by the same band... with the same howling/haunting male voice but music and beats sounded smoother and the guitar sounded sexier. Can't say I felt the same way about the first ED, Walk no Yakusoku, it's not a particularly bad song, but this singer's voice got on my nerves a little bit as well. However, I really liked the 2nd OP theme Calendula Requiem, I like upbeat songs and liked the speed of the words. \\n\r\nI watched this series twice, once in Japanese and the other in English... either way is fine. I suppose, but I don't particularly feel the need to score Japanese audio that much considering people seem to generally like that more than English dubs, personally I will always pick English dubs because I prefer to not have to read subtitles. The English dub was \\n\r\nreally good fit Shiki.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nThe art for this series is pretty nice... It's a mixture of quirky and childish character designs with the set designs being far more detailed and sophisticated. The character designs are definitely of the shounen variety: thick outlines, fierce eyebrows, funky hairstyles and a bright, solid colour palette is used. The real art is shown thru the various settings and backgrounds: walls have visible imperfections and textures, furnishings look believable, the woods look dark and foreboding. What I really appreciated was that we were taken everywhere thru the village, some homes were more modest than others, some were extravagant, the doctor's clinic, the gazebo, the shrine, etc. so many shows would have taken a lazier approach and not have made these settings as detailed. I will say however that the animation was pretty standard, considering this wasn't a type of show that had complex battle scenes then we can forgive that much. The \"camera\" pans, 360 rotations and semi-rotations used for dramatic effects were smooth enough.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nShiki starts out with the story of Megumi, your typical kind of frilly teenage girl with a sour attitude--we all know the type!  She moans on and on about being stuck in some hick town,  completely devoid of any sophistication or panache... we can't blame her though, I know I'd be the same. Anyway, her bitchiness aside, she develops a little crush for the main character, Natsuno, then she becomes a little stalker, then dies in some freakish yet mysterious manner. Her death coincides with the rash of other mysterious deaths occurring in the village, and that's all I can really say about that without going into spoiler territory.  Using \"mysterious deaths\" as an opener for an anime isn't new or rare but at the very least it serves it's purpose by making things very interesting right away. You will immediately have some sort of interest to find out what's wrong with that town... and that's when the narration can take it's time to slowly peel away the layers to reveal the mystery. I thought the pacing was really great, it was never slow and boring,  but it never rushed into big excitement right away either, it was a well controlled and deliberate on a steady climb to a big finish... and it wasn't predictable-Another big plus in my book!  Some episodes definitely toyed with your emotions, such as episode 14. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nthe character designs aren't too shabby, they're drawn quite attractively as far as general face and body shape is concerned... which is always a big plus in my book (who wants to look at ugly people?) But there were some minor niggles that worked their way under my skin. Let's talk about some of the hairstyles, some of them looked about as wild, hard and as immovable as tree bark...especially that little devil-child Sunako. I know according to Twilight, today's vampire likes to play around with a little mousse, maybe some hair wax, but her shit was just straight up ridiculous! Same goes for the nurse, Ritsuko, as much as I liked her character, that hair was silly. it was as if some green rattlesnake bit her on the back of the skull and hung there for all eternity. Then we had some chin problems, chins that ended in a very sharp point, a style I haven't seen since the 90s. And possibly the weirdest, most \"perplexingly\" annoying aspect of their character designs were the eyes... no I'm not talking about the black pupil-less eyes, even though those were creepy as fuck. No I'm talking about the fact that they drew eyelids above eyelashes on everyone. Really???  was this intentional or did someone fail Anatomy and Character Design 101? Eyelashes are at the end of eyelids, so why it's it that when these people lower their lids halfway, it also conceals their eyelashes? that's virtually impossible unless their eyelashes are tucked inwards and scraping their eyeballs. Also the monk's irises are too large!  All that being said, these imperfections or designs don't bother me too tremendously and do not detract from enjoying the story. \\n\r\nThere is a nice mix of characters in this series. You have young people, old people and everyone in between, each with varying personalities and stations within this small hick village. They were all drawn with somewhat realistic proportions and attributes, we didn't have freakishly busty 13-year olds or well fit looking old men. I particularly enjoy this diverse type of ensemble, because I believe the more diverse the cast, the richer the story will be. And this cast is pretty developed... well, at least as developed as 26 episodes can allow. \\n\r\nThe story centres around three central characters: a stubborn gruff doctor, a pensive monk and a brooding teenager. These are the most fully realised characters with completed backgrounds and the narrative shifts from one perspective to the other.  This is definitely a character driven series, which is probably part of the reason why I like it so much.  Because besides these three central characters I mentioned before: Dr. Toshio Ozaki, Seishin Muroi and Natsuno Yuuki, almost every person in the town is given some kind of past or history no matter how inconsequential they are. You get to know these people personally, know their family, their story, empathise and feel their pain, their loss... even some of the so-called \"bad guys.\" Which I especially liked! Nowadays, simply saying bad guys are just bad because they are, is not good enough. A good story goes beyond that, we need to ask; why are they bad? And are they really bad in the first place? Just because they are vampires, does that make them inherently evil? Shiki explores this really well.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT:\\n\r\nI gave this show a \"9\" because I saw something different about this anime. Vampires attacking a town isn't exactly a new concept here, but perhaps I appreciated this interpretation of the vampire... a more human-like vampire, ones with feelings and regret. Not feelings to the point of pure sappiness like Twilight but more along the same vein like \"Interview with a Vampire\" where vampires have their own personalities and behaviours... yet still have the obligations that come along with being a vampire. I also gave it a \"9\" because there are fewer anime clich\u00e9s in this one, no high-schools, no unnecessary guns or explosions, no young grinning shonen with some big sword or robot saving the world...one power up at a time, no love polygons or dramatic death scene where someone screams \"nnnnnoooooooo or akiraaaaaaa\" for seven minutes. This was a proper story with a beginning, middle and a heck of an ending! Definitely worth the watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The mith is put aside and the only things that remain are the fact that they have fangs and they drink blood. Mangakas and producers forget that they can't go out in sunlight and that exists pretty good ways to kill vampires.\r\nSomehow, the vampires in anime/manga are ALWAYS too strong to the world bear they existence and there's too much romance to enjoy the mith. It's like they're humans, but they are dead and kill others to live. And this is SO ridiculous.\r\nBut Shiki is different. Thevampires in this story are excellent. They're not humans anymore. Thay are selfish, evil and don't care about the ones who they left because they only want to eat. That's how the real vampires are and that's the reason I liked of this anime. Oh, and they can be killed like Buffy taught us, too, what is good because it looks like the old mith, but it's a little more modern.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem is Megumi. That bitch needs to die.",

            "content": "[Note: This review contains minor spoilers.]\r\nTo say that the vampire\u2019s image is but a shadow of what it once was before the massive influx of \u201ctwilight vampires\u201d would not be an inaccurate statement. Slowly but surely, vampire\u2019s have turned from sexy, murderous beasts into little more than humans that sparkle with no fangs. However, there have been a few shows that have truly re-established the old dynasty and mystique of the vampires that people used to fear. I can confidently say that Shiki is one of these shows.\r\nShiki (or \u5c4d\u9b3c, if you prefer) is a suspense/horror show adapted from a novel that surrounds the townof Sotoba, a quiet town secluded away from the rest of the world. When a new family (known as the Kirishiki, ironically) moves in, people in the town mysteriously start getting sick, dying off, and otherwise disappearing when they shouldn\u2019t. As the doctor of the town, Toshio Ozaki, begins to panic and look for a solution to the supposed mass outbreak of this \u2018killer disease\u2019, many of the other members of the town fear that something much more sinister than an epidemic is at hand. From here, we meet NatsunoYuuki, our main character who desperately searches for an answer as to why he keeps seeing a girl, Megumi Shimizu, who supposedly died.  A Fair warning to those who do not like slow-paced stories: Shiki starts out very, very slow. The first 3-4 episodes are filled with the Exposition, and it can be tedious to watch, especially if you\u2019re expecting something that hits the ground running, like Deathnote. Think Monster when watching this. The story moves to go at a slow, crushing pace, and each episode has eagerly had me awaiting the next as one mystery is solved, only for another to be introduced. Overall, the plot so far has kept me on the edge of my seat, and I can\u2019t want to see the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the characters, I would say they are the weakest aspect of Shiki. There are 20+ characters that play some important role in the show, and with a majority of them being introduced in the first couple episodes, it can often be hard to keep track of just who is who, or who they\u2019re related to, or what exactly they\u2019re trying to accomplish. Additionally, many of the characters are fairly two-dimensional. Natsuno is a typical male \u2018ice-queen\u2019 lead with a girl hopelessly in love with him, Seishin is a failure at life and completely useless (never seen that before), and there are many other characters that all act very predictably throughout the series. Not that this is a bad thing, as you can sometimes feel yourself rooting for a character to (not) do something, and yet they do it anyways. However, none of the characters seem very memorable aside from the insane (literally) Toshio, who I greatly enjoy watching.\\n\\n\r\nAs if a complete opposite, the music is one of the higher points in the show. The first OP, \"Kuchizuke\" (\u304f\u3061\u3065\u3051) by Buck-Tick, is one of the better openings I\u2019ve heard, and the lyrics are quite relevant to the show. The second OP, \"Calendula Requiem\" by kanon x kanon, is also an excellent opening, but weaker than the first. Neither of the ED\u2019s are especially good, although they give off a nice \u2018evil\u2019 feeling for the end of the episodes.. The background music is fairly well done, and the strange, melodic chorus\u2019 that Shiki features add a lot of depth to some of the scenes. While the music isn\u2019t especially top notch, it makes sense, although I still would have preferred something a bit more involved with an orchestra.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation seems to fall in the middle of the pack. It\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s not terrible either. There have been a few times when I\u2019ve noticed the animation getting a bit jittery, however there are not many action-packed or frame intensive scenes in the show, so it hasn\u2019t really been a problem so far.  The character designs also seem to be just okay (personally, I despise the long, lanky characters, but I know that many people enjoy them.) On the whole they aren\u2019t inherently bad, and they fit the style that Shiki was aiming for. One thing that was very impressive were the eye designs. They range from interesting to downright creepy, and they make watching the show just that much more enjoyable. They\u2019re also a key plot element, so pay attention.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show isn\u2019t completed yet \u2013 Shiki is a very strong show based on the 17 episodes that have aired so far. If it keeps up the way it has been (and I plan to update this review when it finishes) Shiki may just be the best suspense show I\u2019ve ever seen. It certainly rivals the \u2018big\u2019 suspense shows such as Deathnote and Monster, and I am eagerly awaiting the conclusion of this show, as it\u2019s been one hell of a ride so far.\\n\\n\r\n[To the Reviewers that didn\u2019t find this helpful (or even if you did find it helpful) \u2013 feel free to drop a comment on my profile suggesting anything that I could improve upon.]\\n",

            "content": "I found Shiki to be a very un-original Anime. The plotline involves a small, isolated village that is faced with an epidemic of sorts during the summer due to some sort of paranormal/supernatural cause. Thing is, I've seen that plot with Higurashi. While it started in 2006, the series didn't really end until 2009. And then there is also Ookam Kakushi, which aired summer of 2010. It isn't even two years since these series end and we're faced with another of the same plotline, almost as if someone saw that these proved to be cash cows and decided to adapt Shiki for that particular reason.\r\nAndthen we get into the whole vampire issue. I think to many people are jumping onto this Anime simply because it isn't Twilight and it isn't Vampire Knight, which have been concidered some of the poorer vampire storylines out there. However, this series is a far cry from Anime such as Hellsing, Vampire Hunter D and Blood Brothers, not to mention some of the other good, dark vampire classics in Anime that have their roots in Dracula. Even sola is better with it's 'our vampires are different\". It simply doesn't have any charm to it, anything to make it stand out on its own.\\n\\n\r\nPutting those two things aside, the plot is extremely slow. There is little action going on within the story. Not to mention, there is information overload. How does one keep the days straight? That in itself isnt' an easy task as the series progresses. Not to mention, there is tons of storyline that could have been chopped out, simplified. Of course, this is an adaptation of something else, so the fault in that lies in the original source, not the actual Anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the strong points is that a good deal of the characters have very fleshed out personalities. Unfortunatly, there are some problems with them being this good. The viewer isn't given long enough to get to really know and relate to the characters before they are even gone, either through death, or off screen time. The other problem, which relates to the previous one is, there are too many characters to keep track of. Truth be told, the same story could have been told with fewer characters put in here.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then their is the artwork. I love the experimentation that the animators put in, but the thing with experimentation is, it doesn't always work. I know Anime hair is supposed to defy gravity, but some of the hair on females REALLY takes the cake, even more so then some of the really wierd hair cuts on some of the male characters from Asura Cryin'. While this does fit with the horror aspect of the show, some of it was taken overboard. Not to mention the light and dark sides of things don't mesh or blend well.\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit though, the anime did happen to give me nightmares. Not the kind that causes you to wake up screaming, but the kind where you are restless and your dreams wonder. But... I wasn't watching this for the fear factor, I was watching for the storyline, which basically is no existant, at least through the first third of the storyline, which is all I am choosing to watch at this point. But I think the best thing to say is, don't get caught up in the hype that has resulted from people's frustrations with Twilight and such. The story... it simply can't compare to the greats in Vampire Anime.",

            "content": "Tl:DR review: Still a better vampire story then Twilight. \r\nShiki tried hard to present a sort of a grey world where there was no clear cut good and bad and both sides were justified in their actions. Well it tried.. But it failed terribly. \r\nFrom the opening to the almost 18 episodes, all the vampires are shown to be these cold, calculating killers who are methodically exterminating an entire town and all of a sudden after episode 18, the show asks us to feel bad for them. Why? Because humanity decided to fight back. Yeah thats it. The show is peppered with pointless philosophy whichis prattled on by a fucking retarded no-balls priest. This shitty priest is so addled with the retarded philosophy he spouts that he goes on about how humans shouldn't judge the actions of vampires when there are people dying by the dozens day by day. Great job priest. To add to this irony, this fucker decides that joining the vampires makes the most sense because \"no one understands him like Sunako\" Dude was probably just a closeted lolicon. \\n\\n\r\nLets not even get started on the Vampires. They waltz into the town and systematically start wiping out the populace and yet somehow they are tragic, misunderstood creatures. Yeah right. Seems pretty black and white to me. Oh and the hierarchy makes absolutely no sense. Why in the blue hell is Sunako the leader when she is neither wise nor good at fighting? By all accounts she is utterly average. But muh loli vampire mascot. \\n\\n\r\nThe show does nothing to make the vampires relatable. Megumi was a spoilt, self-entitled teen who remained the same albiet more psychotic post death, Tohru was a somewhat likeable guy who becomes a wailing cry baby post death, Nao was a loving mother and wife who systematically kills her son, husband and in-laws post death and Masao was cowardly dick pre and post death. Why the fuck should I care for any of them? Ohh bu-bu-but humans will killed them.. good fucking riddance.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is saved from being an utter trainwreck by a decently characterized town doctor Ozaki who seems to be the only one who actually acts like a normal person would and its easy to get behind him. The human side is generally relatable. A close knit village decides to resort to violence when faced with the threat of extermination. I can not only relate, I also wholeheartedly support their actions. They didn't start the fight, they didn't kill anyone. They lived their lives peacefully until vampires came in and forced them to fight. Bu-bu-but they are violent. Well you should thought about that before killing half the village shouldn't you. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter models is alright. A number of them sport outrageous hairstyles that defy the very laws of gravity and physics. There is nothing to write about in terms of animation. Its serviceable. The music in parts is surprisingly good. \\n\\n\r\nIn spite of all its shortcomings, I founds myself wanting to watch more and finish the show. The story is deeply flawed but in spite of it, dare I say enjoyable. The last few episodes are essentially a gore fest where they try so hard to portray the humans as bloodthirsty, violent creatures where in fact they are simply fighting for their existence. Overall a good decent watch.",

            "content": "Shiki was my first anime that is all about vampires and werewolves. If you are a vampire story enthusiast then you will like this one. Ja! Vampire enthusiast or not read my simple review so you can get an idea on how did I finish this one even though I am not into vampire stories. \nMaybe at first you will hesitate to watch this one and I admit that I am one of them but for some reason I managed to finish the story and leave me \"Amazed\" and \"Satisfied\"\nJa! Let's start this one.\nArt 7/10 : Art for location is really nice. Simple and verydetailed. Art for Shiki is not totally good when it comes to its character. I can rate it as an above average only. Lines are too sharp especially on chins, and there are also some issues when it comes to colours. Especially when it comes to the \"Risen\" features. I've interpret this one as they were emphasizing the viewers on what is the difference between a normal person and a vampire. ( I think )\\n\nBut, maybe behaviour and eye colours are enough to determine this.\\n\\n\nSound 8/10 : Sounds are really nice but still in an average tone. I've never encountered any issues when it comes BGM and SFX. Totally rhymes with the theme of the story.\\n\\n\nCharacter 8/10 : I am really amazed with this part as handling a huge number of characters is not easy. Although Shiki has only \"Four\" main characters; the other characters are not generic and they had difference with each other when it comes to 1) Behaviour 2) Characteristics 3) Personality and 4) Traits.\\n\nAlso I enjoyed the town atmosphere when elders are chatting outside their houses very typical. (Thumbs UP)\\n\\n\nEnjoyment 9/10 : I am not a Twilight or Vampire enthusiast but I really enjoyed this one. The idea of the plot and the story is really impressive.\\n\\n\nOverall 9/10 : Ending was really impressive. \\n\\n\nNote : This review never intended to persuade or to please everybody. All of the words that you read are only based in my opinions.\\n",

            "content": "Wow, what a painful watch it's been... I nearly dropped this show after the horrible first 3 episodes, but I couldn't believe, after reading all the positive reviews here, that it had no redeeming qualities. Well, guess what ? It has none.\r\nStory-wise, Shiki is quite lackluster : though the starting point isn't that bad, it stays too faithful to its premise and never surprises the viewer. The bad storytelling doesn't help, since things happen slowly and very routinely during the first half. Furthermore, it's not really credible as a whole : during the 3 months span in which tons of dramatic events happen, there isabsolutely NO interaction with the outside world (no media, no police, no nothing), how the hell would that be possible nowadays ? \\n\\n\r\nI should also mention there were glaring holes in the plot : you leave a certain character on the verge of being killed, with 0 chance of surviving, only to find him on the hospital, 5 episodes later, without any semblance of explanation. Oh, and there is no proper ending...\\n\\n\r\nAs disappointed as I was with the story, what really killed the show for me was its awful characters. Lots of characters are introduced in the first few episodes, 90% of which have absolutely no trait or personality (being useless cannon fodder). The main characters themselves are incredibly bland : we hardly get to know anything about their past and motivation (aside from the rare flashback), and they show very few emotions throughout the 22 episodes. How are we supposed to feel dread from a horror show, if we cannot in the least identify with the characters ?\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, they display remarkably little consistency in their deductions and actions; especially the (presumably) main character, Doctor Ozaki, being able to make a mental U turn in the blink of an eye, from a totally rational approach to a total acceptance of the supernatural theory, then \"disproving\" said theory in front of everyone before proving it a few episodes later...\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Shiki does not fare better art-wise, I'd even go as far as to say that this show is, for the most part, an eyesore. The character design is utterly terrible : pointy noses and chins, weird eyes, hideous outfits (especially with some of the shikis), and, last but not least, those ludicrous haircuts. Some characters are just plain repulsive (that Masao guy...) and made me want to stab myself in the eye. Even the supposedly moe character (gothloli Sunako) was more weird than cute. Also, while I don't mind more realistic-looking characters, I felt I got trolled with the abundance of sexy poses/outfits involving  that old fat manly looking nurse...\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was bad as well, with lots of still images and slow pans, very static characters and relatively stiff movements.\\n\\n\r\nSound was a bit better, with some nice and fitting tracks (some of the most electronic ones did feel out of place though), but the 2 OPs/EDs were mediocre and readily forgotten. Voice acting ranged from \"average\" to \"awful\" (Masao again...).\\n\\n\r\nAs an avid horror stories consumer, enticed by the excellent ratings given to this show, I consider Shiki an utter failure. It fails as a horror show (neither the story nor the atmosphere gave me any thrill), it fails as a mystery show (there is NO mystery whatsoever), and it fails at delivering its underlying message (the whole \"aren't good and evil relative ?\" is meaningless and childish when conveyed in such an awkward way). Plus, it's painfully bad looking.\\n\\n\r\nPlease, do yourself a favor and don't waste 8 hours of your life with that trash.",

            "content": "Vampire anime has never been my cup of tea. I\u2019ve seen a fair amount of such anime and for me, they usually turn out to be really corny (such as Dance in the Vampire Bund), boring (such as Shingetsutan Tsukihime), shallow and chockfull of fanservice (Rosario + Vampire) or just plain lame (Black Blood Brothers). I\u2019ve gotten tired of seeing vampires presented to be as majestic, perfect, idol-like creatures, leading glamorous lives and just happen to suck blood for nourishment. Are vampires really monsters, or just sissies?\r\nThen I saw Shiki.\r\nIt\u2019s surprisingly good. I wouldn\u2019t call it a masterpiece but it\u2019s interesting, not to mention actuallyquite frightening, as horror stories should be. The first few episodes hint on what is happening, but you\u2019re not completely sure what it is until the characters discover it for themselves. Because of that the pacing is quite slow for the viewers, but for the characters it\u2019s actually timely and realistic.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, there are a lot of them and as expected with a large cast, development is hard to manage. There are some characters who disappear from the story for a bit, and when they come back, clearly a lot happened but not a lot about it is said so you\u2019re left to ponder on it. There are some scenes that I would have liked to see, and I\u2019d like to give some examples but I\u2019ll leave it at that to avoid spoiling anyone.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately though, the most interesting character in my opinion is the one who is most developed, and that is the doctor Ozaki Toshio. You get to see a lot of what is going on in his mind - what he discovers as the story progresses, how he deals with it, what kind of person he is, etc. I really think his character is very fascinating, and will make you think what you would do if you were in his place. How far will you go to survive? Ozaki and the other characters all answer that question in their own way as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s generally a likable cast, and the voice acting only makes them even more so. Among the roster of the voice actors chosen for this anime, I noticed that a good portion of them are relatively new/under the radar, including the young and promising Yuuki Aoi. Regardless of tenure, all members of the cast, even those with the smaller roles, are good, capable and convincing.\\n\\n\r\nWhat isn\u2019t entirely convincing though, is the art. Sometimes the facial expressions of the characters are too exaggerated, that it seems fake, such as this scene: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lha4faBeSw1qdbg2p.jpg\\n\r\nI get that she\u2019s really happy to see Natsuno, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s that happy.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs in general are a little cartoony, with the weird hairstyles and all, but only for the more dominant characters. The lesser characters look more subdued. The gore seems a bit over the top too, but I think it\u2019s acceptable in this case because it\u2019s part of the story-telling.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the art is okay. The visuals really compliment the story. It\u2019s a little inconsistent now and then and the colors clash sometimes but I like how they went for something a bit more colorful, because usually with horror anime the visuals are dark and gloomy.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, I think the soundtrack is very well done. From the subtle sound effects to the background music, it all really contributes to the feel of the story and makes each scene more special. The OPs and EDs are very good too. I really like the first OP, \u201cKuchikuze\u201d by rock band Buck-Tick. I think it really goes well with the series. The vocals are really good, the lyrics relate to the story and it\u2019s quite catchy and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nI think the main reason why I like Shiki is because it\u2019s not shallow like most vampire anime. It allows us viewers to think, instead of blinding us with how \u201ccool\u201d vampires are. Sure, vampires are amazing beings with many traits and abilities that normal humans don\u2019t have, but they are still monsters, and to survive, they need to feed on humans. If you think of it that way, vampires aren\u2019t really that cool, huh? It seems that in the latest vampire anime, as well as in general media, they fail to emphasize that in their representation. Thankfully, Shiki does well in that aspect and in many others. If you don't mind gore and you want to watch a horror anime that\u2019s a little more deep than the usual, then surely Shiki is for you.",

            "content": "Okay, lets try this again since my last review didn't go so well :p\r\nI finished Shiki just recently and i was very pleased with it especially in the beginning. The exposition was suspenseful and exciting. I noticed some people didn't like the slow start, i guess it's preference because i seemed to enjoy the build up. There was a vast cast of characters, typically these characters would be cannon fodder or they would lack substance. The cast of Shiki was the opposite. The show made you care for the characters and developed them well. Dr. Ozaki specifically had an really good voice acting performance. Therewere one or two characters that were slightly annoying and came off as whiney, or were slightly underused, but saying this is nit picking. Now back to the story, there was a slow build up but it was necessary to introduce the large cast of characters, and to build tension and anticipation. It also acted as a hook to keep me wanting more. Also, it felt pretty grounded even though it's obvious fiction. The animation looked great, all the colors and designs were pretty and fun to look at. The first intro suited the series well and the second wasn't half bad. And the score for the series sounds really good and suits the anime well. The sounds are very eerie and dark which is good. The middle of the anime is the best in my opinion. For some reason the ending didn't set as well with me as i was expecting. There were some things that were left un answered and some characters i felt just died for no reason at all. But overall there weren't really any plot holes and the story was great all the way through. I liked how in the beginning there was a mystery element which was interesting. So overall this was a great anime, i'm gonna buy it on blue ray and i most definitley recommend this as a starter anime for those just getting into the genre like i am. Or i'd recommend it to anyone in general.\\n\\n\r\nHope this review was helpful (:",

            "content": "OK Lion Tamers, we'll look at \"Shiki\"!\r\nI decided to give this thing a look. And I think most people, who like suspense thrillers, might actually go for this thing.\r\nI am usually quite picky about Vampire offerings, because people have done this thing to death (pun intended). More importantly, while almost every authorship has done Vampire stories (comics, novels, plays, movies, and now anime), what is worse is the slow evolution from the original rules for Vampires; a la Bram Stoker- to something where the original idea has begun to evolve into a completely new beast.\r\nWhile even I have created a new type of Vampire fromtime to time, in fan-fiction; it is refreshing to find a story that actually sticks to most of the original rules of the game.\\n\\n\r\n\"Shiki\" is such an offering. Even the characters offered share similar character types to the original Bram Stoker novel of Dracula; even though they carry different names, professions, and characteristics (on the surface), they fit the original places for each Bram Stoker character.\\n\\n\r\nIn Shiki:\\n\\n\r\nDracula is a little girl, Sunako Kirishiki\\n\\n\r\nRenfield is a young teenager, Natsuno \"Koide\" Yuuki\\n\\n\r\nMina Harker is another teenager, Shimizu, Megumi\\n\\n\r\nDoctor Van Helsing, Doctor Toshio Ozaki\\n\\n\r\nThe above is just a short list. You will find other characters that substitute for Bram Stoker archetypes as well. And some of you may differ on my selections. But I think you'll see where Shiki has parallels to Dracula, in characters, basic behaviors, actions, and finally the reactions of all players.\\n\\n\r\nI found it very enjoyable to predict the next thing to happen, because the story is laid out (in general) so closely to Dracula. What a pleasure to see the town becoming less and less of itself; as Vampires increase in number pyramidically. It was even fun to watch, as Doctor Toshio Ozaki finally came to the conclusion that the only way out, was to apply a liberal dose of \"... wooden stake through the heart ...\", in an attempt to save his town. In the end, instead of a dose of Sunlight, the ultimate solution became a forest fire. Clever!\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who like a dose of humor in your suspense thriller, you are out of luck. Shiki is entirely and totally camp (or in newer English, deadly deadpan serious). Think dialog from Godzilla, and you'll get the idea. This is not a bad thing, in fact it matches the tone intended by the makers, perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialog leads us through each scene, from one nasty piece of work to the next, extracting tension in ways that look innocent enough; but almost always has double meanings. Music is excellent, and fleshes out each scene and major event; always pregnant with expectation. The opening and closing music, while inappropriate at points, has lyrics that matches Shiki's story and intents (which is fairly rare, as the music is usually more important in most offerings, than the lyrics).\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few rough spots. Pacing is sometimes irregular, and there are times I do not understand some references that are plainly a Japanese intention (not being Japanese is a handicap for us Anglo's ).\\n\\n\r\nBut if you like traditional Vampire tales, you might truly enjoy Shiki. I give it a 7.",

            "content": "Story: The series started out a bit slow, but it quickly picked up the pace and delved into what started to feel a bit like Higurashi. It has a similar atmosphere of mystery wrapped up in the cloak of a peaceful environment. However it became quickly and dully apparent what was killing the villagers and from this point deteriorated what feels like a very contrived form of despair. Most of the characters (and there a lot of them) seem to possess no real intelligence or logic and have very few realistic reactions to the events that keep occurring around them. This eventually infects the \"main\"characters and things go even further downhill from there. I wonder if these people have ever heard of a telephone? \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The style in this is very unique, I have only seen it used in one other anime which I can't remember at the moment. I thought it was a bit weird at first but it kind of grew on me and I also appreciated the fact they disguised the characters so well. Rather than trying to make all the characters attractive as many anime do, there is a large variety of appearances to distinguish everyone. Ugly, fat, average, old, young, middle age, and a few  good looking characters -- making it quite well balanced.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music seems fitting for the setting and I have no complaints about the voice acting. Other than the fact a few people have awkward appearance / voice combinations.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As mentioned in the story section, the characters are very shallow. It seems like the creators purposely made them all stupid in order to allow the antagonists to rain free without any real thought or purpose.\\n\r\nUpdate: It seems the doctor in the village does possess some intelligence as well as strength of will, but he doesn't seem to want others to know what he does. It's like... oh I saw a guy with a axe walk by the window outside, but I shouldn't tell the others that are staying in the house... right.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The story had some potential initially, but the mundane characters and progression are slowly destroying any enjoyment I may have had in the initial and very short lived mystery. \\n\r\nUpdate: The only mystery left is why in a town of 1300+ people no one has seen fit to tell anyone outside the town about the very bizarre events that have been taking place. Even diffusion of responsibility has it's limits, or perhaps I am overestimating the villagers? I suppose there is nothing strange about 6 members of my family suddenly dieing in a short period of time when they had no prior health problems.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If the story had been set about 100 years ago it would of probably been much better. Being based around modern times and people however, makes it absolutely horrendous due to a utter suspension of reality. The writer needs to take technology and education into consideration when trying to write about vampires in modern times. Particularly since the plot clumsily tries to deal with it, if they had outright ignore it as least the viewer wouldn't have been compelled to think about it.\\n",

            "content": "The opening scene, in which a search party of villagers find in the woods the body of one of their own, a young girl, sets the tone for the 22-episode funeral that is Shiki. In terms of narrative, it breaks no new ground; a remote village is infested by vampires (not romanticized here as has been the trend in recent years, but portrayed once more as malevolent predators with whom the living cannot coexist) who kill the villagers one by one and replace them with their own kind.\r\nIt works through its cold-blooded commitment to its moribund atmosphere, existing in a perpetual state of grief forthose already lost and those about to go. The cast is not the most nuanced or memorable, but it is good enough for the repeated tragedies to evoke more than apathy. They are normal people; few with any heroic strain, most unaware of why their parents, children, friends, neighbors and lovers are dying, their love for one another the only vigil against the night where the dead supplant the living and death supplants life.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is utterly enveloping in its sadness; from only a few episodes in I could not stop watching except to eat and sleep, and I ended up finishing the whole series within the span of 24 hours. My one major gripe with it is the fanservice. It is thankfully far from ubiquitous, but a few female characters are very unrealistically proportioned and when an especially dramatic scene (a few in the series' second half come to mind, but I can't go into details without spoiling things) has comically oversized breasts bouncing around it is about as distracting and inappropriate as a stripper at a funeral. I haven't read the novel series that served as the basis for this adaptation, but I'm guessing it didn't have this problem.",

            "content": "Ah, Shiki.\r\nIf you're willing to put up with a few plot holes, a large amount of rather graphic violence, and some strange stylistic flairs, then you're in for a real treat with this one.\r\nThis anime does something few other vampire stories manage to do these days: captivate you with the thrill of the genre. There is a mystery unfolding, a morally ambiguous danger in the air, and a whimsical sort of horror to it all that puts Shiki a cut above the rest.\r\n- Story: 8 -\r\nFor the most part, Shiki's plot is very solid. There is a very strong impression of suspense that builds asyou discover what exactly is going on in the secluded village of Sotoba. Unfortunately, towards the second third of the story, there are some glaring circumstances that seem almost inexplicable, which you may very well shout at as an observer of the whole scenario. It gets to the point where you really have to give the story some liberty, sadly.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, stick around to watch the whole anime (including the 2 specials!) and you won't be disappointed. There is a subtle point to all the absurdities that do transpire, and it is worth absorbing in its entirety. I only wish it made just a touch more sense. But, it is about vampires, I suppose, so how real can it honestly get? Some ridiculousness seems necessary to make the more horrific parts more accessible, oddly enough.\\n\\n\r\nForgive Shiki of its sins. It recognizes its own fallibility as a fiction, and it often plays off that self-awareness by inviting us to accept the madness the story is all about. Just go with it, and you'll have a great time.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Art: 9 -\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Shiki is quite pleasant, but at times, it feels a little less focused than what might be expected. Perhaps that's the point, though. There are moments of raw terror that are exquisitely well-illustrated, but those are occasionally mixed in with lightheartedness and almost comical facial designs. One truly impressive feat, however, which should not be overlooked by any means, is the fact that pretty much every single villager of Sotoba looks unique. The animators painstakingly took the time to create a genuinely new character in every single one of these people, including those that don't have any dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nSo, there's something to be said for the diversity of artistic style in the show. A few times, including a few hairstyles and color palettes, it feels jarringly juxtaposed into the horror atmosphere, but if you look past the beady-eye tears and the dyed hair, you will see a strong continuity of creative, stylized characters in a rich, grounded village setting. Some of the angles taken for the backgrounds are very well chosen, harnessing a certain degree of cinematic precision to the whole rigamarole, such as with the 'helicopter' overview of the village and its castle.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Sound: 10 - \\n\\n\r\nShiki doesn't disappoint in the audio department. It should be noted I watched in dubbed English, and this happens to be one show you might want to watch dubbed. The VAs do a fantastic job, and each character feels original. A couple of voices are grating, but there is always a reason for it. \\n\\n\r\nBesides voice acting, the sound effects are phenomenal and really on-point. The horror is amplified greatly by careful decisions to accent scenes with crisp, sometimes disturbingly real sounds. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few musical tracks that repeat perhaps once or twice too often, but overall, the musical score for Shiki is also quite impressive. The tracks are always fitting and pull you further into the scenes. Additionally, for such vocal-heavy intros and outros (which I normally find off-putting), Shiki's opening and closing OSTs are rather catchy, and I was pleasantly surprised that I ended up watching them more often than not, since they seemed to build the excitement into and out of each episode quite well.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Character: 10 -\\n\\n\r\nThis is the department in which Shiki really shines. As mentioned already, every character is visually unique and has their own personality. Even the old folks sitting on the bench in the first episode eventually have separate lines of thought established. There is a sentiment that builds around the structure of the show that, while watching it, one is embarking upon a journey to discover just what it is like to be a villager in Sotoba. At the same time, we also gradually learn to understand the Shiki as well, so that the two sides of the story are eventually clashing in the mind.\\n\\n\r\nSome might argue that a few bad apples ruin the core of Shiki. However, if the show is given some liberty, it will not let down. It is well aware of the characters it is crafting, and it feels as passionately about the circumstances that transpire as its audience does. There is a deliberate effort being made to place the audience in the shoes of the main characters, such that we observers feel as emotionally involved as possible. If something disturbing happens to a character we like, be assured it was intentional. This is a classic horror in the sense that anyone and everyone is likely to be a victim, and there's no telling who will be sentenced next.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment: 9 -\\n\\n\r\nBecause of its shortcomings in terms of the plot, Shiki doesn't deserve a perfect score for entertainment. Sure, it's a gripping tale with lots of suspense, thrill, horror, and poignant moral dilemmas, but let's just say the second third of the show is a little bit of a letdown. Certain things happen that seem illogical, and it does take a little bit of a mental hurdle to excuse the rationale of some of the seemingly wiser characters. Some of the conclusions of the show actually get foreshadowed a little bit too early, and the logic behind some individuals only makes sense in the aftermath of it all. Again, sit tight and let it run its course, and Shiki will, without fail, be very entertaining.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- OVERALL: 9.2/10 -\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who rarely looks forward to the next inclusion of vampires in modern fiction storytelling, I went into watching the anime Shiki, or Corpse Demon, with very low expectations. I came out of it with a smirk and a head full of thoughts, happy to write my first review on MAL. \\n\\n\r\nIf you can excuse a bit of graphical intensity, give Shiki a shot. It delivers in full, and it lives up to the genre it seeks to redefine. It may cut a few corners, but honestly, it didn't mean to hurt anyone. If you forgive it for its forsaken ways, you might just let yourself get bitten. Enjoy!",

            "content": "Shiki is one of the most surprisingly good animes that I've watched. Definitely one of the few outstanding ones out of all the \"good\" ones. It is gripping, intense, exciting, deep, but the number one thing that stands out of it all - it is incredibly REALISTIC. And realism is something most animes, especially animes that have vampires and other mythical creatures in them, fall short of.\r\nTL:DR\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nArt: 6/10\r\nSound: 6/10\r\nCharacter: 8/10\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\r\nOverall: 8/10\r\nGood points:\r\n+Very good allusion and foreshadowing\r\n+Suspenseful, exciting, thrilling\r\n+Wide cast of multi-faceted and unique characters\r\n+Very strong main protagonist\r\n+Moral discourse on murder, death and survival\r\n+Good second OP and ED themes\r\n+Excellent background music\r\n+Realistic reactions and plotline\\n\\n\r\nBad Points:\\n\r\n-Underwhelming resolution\\n\r\n-Bad first OP and ED themes\\n\r\n-Some repetitive episodes towards the middle\\n\r\n-Confusing set of antagonists\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWe start off in a secluded village that is quite isolated from the rest of the world. Megumi may have been a rather annoying, ignorant character, but her opinion on her own village helps to set the entire scene in the first episode. And of course, what happens at the end of the first episode just makes the audience want to watch more. And it's basically a horror roller coaster ride from there.\\n\\n\r\nA seemingly wealthy family called the Kanemasa move into a house on top of the hill in the village, but everything is not quite what it seems. People start dying one by one, for reasons unknown, leaving the only village doctor, Ozaki, perplexed and most of all frustrated at both himself and at the situation. His other friend, Muroi, a temple monk, similarly is haunted by sadness and tragedy of all these deaths, and expresses his feelings in his literature.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses, Ozaki learns about the true causes of these deaths in the village and vows to put an end to it. He learns about the true nature of the enemy through brutality, he essentially turns into a monster in order to learn about the monsters he is fighting. Then, after many tries, he convinces the remaining villagers to fight back against the vampiric race called \"Shiki\".\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the plot's overarching horror, and I thought that the show put across this suspense, terror and drama in an excellent fashion. You would usually expect the Shiki to have some form of special magical powers, they don't, under than the fact that they can turn other people into Shiki of their own, but even then, not at a 100% success rate (though this is rather ambiguous). The story maintains realism, and brings out natural reactions of both the Shiki and humans in the conflict that they are in.\\n\\n\r\nThere are humans who vow to kill Shiki no matter what, humans who feel like they shouldn't be killing things no matter what, there are also Shiki who feel that they are not wrong to kill humans to survive, and Shiki who vow not to kill humans no matter what. It's a comprehensive and complete picture about the idea of morality, of rules, of freedom, of what constitutes murder and a realistic discourse of right and wrong.\\n\\n\r\nYou have a father who kills his own son, a sister who kills her own brother, a man who kills his own wife, family members turn on each other, friends who end up killing each other... wait this essentially sounds like the story of Cain and Abel right? Brother on brother, son on father, this is EXACTLY what was alluded to during the discourse between Muroi and Sunako in the temple. So that's what it was about! The question is - what is the intention behind killing, and is killing ever justifiable? Sunako states \"there is always a reason behind killing.\" She doesn't think killing for survival can be wrong, but if that's the case, does that make it right to kill? Most humans, even those that have converted into Shiki, act like they don't think so.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also several plot twists in the show relating to Ozaki's plan. The plot is completely compelling, exciting and exhilarating to watch. I did not give the plot a perfect score only because of the sub-par resolution at the end. There were some loose ends not completely tied up, such as the ultimate fate of the surviving villagers, or of Muroi, Ozaki, Sunako and of course, our favourite, Yuuki. And I thought that the ending episode felt abit rushed and not completely thought-out. Motoko's sudden urge to burn the whole of Yamairi seemed like a convenient way to explain the ending, in episode 21.5.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the plot is definitely impressive. I would have given this anime an 8 for plot, but I actually noticed a detail that was good. I went to count all the number of times that Shiki were killed and I found that the numbers tally. (for more explanation, see below in \"other comments\")\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nEverywhere is just blood, blood, and blood. It's disgusting, gory and downright suits the horror theme best. The general mood of the art work is dark, gloomy and suspenseful, and that added a lot to the anime. The red eyes are everywhere, and so are those white fangs. It's even giving me the shivers. Animation wise, everything was quite smooth, it was pleasing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI really disliked the first OP and ED. But I enjoyed hearing the second OP and ED. Also, throughout the show, suspense is built up and the sense of eerie dread is made clear through the carefully composed music, which, was probably quite repetitive, but still effective enough to bring across that dark tone to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many characters in this show, that it is nearly impossible to develop them properly. But this anime has excelled in bringing out the back stories of so many characters, and so realistically that it's possible to empathize with every death of every important person who goes through a conversion into a Shiki. Their feelings are conveyed very clearly and their emotions hit you right to the core.\\n\\n\r\nEven the character interactions are solid. Every personality is unique and stands for something in the anime. Nobody is just a \"sheep\" or a \"follower\". Most characters bear weight in this anime, whether they are main or supporting. In fact, I would say that this is one of the few anime which reduces the plot impact of the main cast and distributes them to rest of the supporting cast, and does it magnificently without diminishing the value of any of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nFavourite character? Definitely Ozaki, the main protagonist. He's smart, scientific and all, but he's also determined, willing to make sacrifices, has incredibly high tolerance for sadness and pain, and while he seems cold to some people, he is just incredibly focused at the task at hand. The amount of blood that appears on him increases drastically from episodes 16 onwards, because of all the Shiki-slaying that he's been doing. What a badass.\\n\\n\r\nBut he doesn't outshine the other characters, all of whom also have their awesome points. We have a crazy lunatic woman, and independent old lady who managed to uncover the secret of the Risen before many other people do. We have a bearded, muscular old man whose role in the entire anime is to scold people and punch them in the face, and generally be the tough guy. We also have the cast of werewolves, who are, in my opinion, much cooler than any of the Shiki.\\n\\n\r\nThe main downfall of the anime are the antagonists, who basically are just a confusing bunch of people. Also, we have the main antagonist, Sunako, who looks too innocent to be a main antagonist, and is instead just lamenting her sad existence as one rejected by God. Tatsumi looks more like the evil mastermind, but he isn't. There is Seishirou who ends up killing one of their own werewolves? Then there's also the scantily-dressed Chizuru whose main job is to seduce people for... fun? They are not convincingly evil in anyway, and they don't seem to have any real motivation for \"survival\", I thought that they survived well enough in that mansion of theirs and they honestly did not need to attack villagers to \"survive\". It was more like to \"increase their brethren\" but that was never brought out in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's' still a very balanced cast of characters, and I must say, a job well done!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI cannot give the anime a perfect score for enjoyment because there were honestly parts that tired me out. The beginning of the anime was very gripping, and so was the all-out war at the ending few episodes, but somewhere down the middle, it seemed as if the episodes were just repeating itself over and over again. There was a simple recipe: A person dies, some situation leads to that person dying is revealed, Ozaki is frustrated he can't save the person. And the \"epidemic\" carries on. This was essentially the main plot line of many episodes near the middle, and kept repeating itself. Perhaps it was to show Ozaki's persistence and determination, but I thought it went slightly overboard with detailing so many number of deaths in the village, and the constant \"impending doom\" effect.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I really enjoyed all the suspense and horror that was just a recurring theme and tone throughout the anime. It never deviated from this theme even once. I was completely hooked to this anime start to end, and I basically finished watching this in two days. That was an exhilarating ride!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was one of the better animes I have seen in the recent months, and I would recommend it to all. Just don't watch it at night, or you might have some trouble sleeping. (NEVER invite people into your house!)\\n\\n\\n\r\nOther comments:\\n\r\nIn episode 20, Ozaki stated that the villagers managed to kill exactly 20 Shiki. Tatsumi later explains to Sunako that they lost around 30% of their Shiki collaborates. A quick calculation leads to the conclusion that there were around 67 Shiki under their control before the purge broke out.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing that, I counted every Shiki that died from episodes 20 onwards until the end, and the number indeed turned out to be 67. If you're interested, EP 20 - 20 kills, EP 20.5 - 33 kills, EP 21 - 13 kills, EP 22 - 1 kill, total to exactly 67 kills. Of course, there is some ambiguity about whether some of them were actually killed or not, but this leads to at most a discrepancy of (+-2). I was impressed by the mathematical detail to put into this, so bonus 1 point for that.",

            "content": "Hello to you all!!\r\nThis the my first attempt a writing a review, so I hope it's not too bad.\r\nLet's get this going. Well Shiki is quite the good anime, i didn't read the light novels so i'm not going to make comparisons there.\r\nIn terms of story I have to say that it has a very nice plot, different from most vampire stories that will make you think about where humanity can go and how far can to stretch your soul into to doing the \"right thing\". For me it does have some pacing problems but it doesn't take merit from the story.\r\nThe art is greatto me, different and it blends well with the theme of the story. The sinister colors mixed with some really strong ones makes it even more creepier, and the result is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is close to perfection. From the openings and endings to the sound tracks in the episodes. It blends perfectly and always entices the special moments in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters. Hum that's the hard part. For me it was hard to understand because there a lot of characters, which complicated sometimes to know who they were talking about in some scenes. There are complicated and well developed characters and simpler ones that don't get that much attention. Anyway overall they are enjoyable and you feel the dilemmas and struggles that they are facing. They will make you like and sympathize with them.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the enjoyment, as i said before, for me it had some pace problems, in a way that sometimes it was a bit boring, witch made it a bit difficult to watch, it took me sometime to finish. But don't let that take you away from it. Overall it's a very good anime, with a interesting plot and characters. \\n\\n\r\nDefinitively a anime to watch and take into consideration.\\n\\n\r\nI hope i was helpful :) If not let me know how i can make it better :D",

            "content": "NOTE: I write this review out of sheer enthusiasm for the series, which I watched pretty recently and eventually became one of my favourites.\r\nStory: 7\r\nVampires try to take over an entire village. OK. \r\nNot an original story taking into account the trend back then, but still the evolution of it tried to make it one. The story is not just gore or about how cool vampires are, but about humans and vamps try to eliminate each other. \r\nWell, try and think how possible would be for you to convince your fellow humans that monsters exist in order to save yourself as well as them. Trickyhuh? And this would be only the 1/100 of what it would take to just stay alive...That's what I call 'on the edge of one's seat'.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe most contradictory part. Well, to tell the truth, I didn't like it much. It was too kitsch for me. Also it was inconsistent - the nurse friend of Ritsuko was like a character from 'Perfect Blue' despite most of the characters looked like the average anime. Yes, some of the characters' hair and clothes were plain rediculus, BUT I did not hate it for that - try to make a character out of an entire village distinguishable without overdoing it in the design of him/her and I will call you a genius! The artist(s) did what they could do about it and I don't blame them for that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nOT and ET fitted nicely, but I was completely taken by the rest of the OST. Orchestral music at its best.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nAll characters displayed consistency. Given that everyone that played a significant part to the story had to be distinct, some aspects were exaggerated. That's what made the viewer sympathize with them though.\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILER*\\n\r\nThe only non-consistant character was Tatsumi. At first he was a no-brain sadist and at the end, he showed such tenderness towards Sunako. And then when asked from Muroi why he was serving her he gave a surprisingly sophisticated reply. I mean seriously?\\n\r\n*END OF SPOILER*\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI really really really enjoyed Shiki. Really. I couldn't stop myself from watching many episodes in the row every day and believe me I don't have much spare time on the weekdays. It was utterly suspensefull. Not to mention that after the end of the series I had a fucked up mind for 3 days.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nMaybe it is one of my favourite anime, but I can't overlook its flaws. The story had holes. Personally, I couldn't get the 'kind' and 'justified' part of vampires that the series tried to communicate - I just wanted them to disappear as they should - but that's another extended conversation. Nevertheless, it was amazing for me. I hope you 'll enjoy it as much as me if you plan to watch it.",

            "content": "Throughout history, there are many myths and the topic that gets focused on the most is vampires and ghosts. These topics are controversial because they can\u2019t be proven real, yet they can\u2019t be proven false. There are documentations stating their existence, but most people would rather have firsthand experience to believe it. What led to this topic was the fear created by humans. We have a subconscious to think that supernatural events happen and we blame an oddity. Media however protrudes vampire is another essence. Vampires are seen as eerie monsters, but some may be seen in a different light such as romantically. A goodexample would be Twilight or Vampire Diaries for the Western media. An anime example would be Rosario Vampire or Vampire Knight. A manga example would be In Bura!. These are popular titles, yet they don\u2019t show the true meaning of fear. What brought about these myths is the fear created by humans. Is it true to say that we don\u2019t fear vampires and ghosts now?\\n\\n\r\n\tI am a sucker for dark themes. I always enjoyed watching horror movies when I was young and would be frightened. It is the fear factor that made me watch it. I grew curious and soon attached to dark genres. What I do like about dark themes is that it shows what the author was thinking and how the director puts the story into place. Soon my attention was brought about to anime. I was suddenly in love with the vampire genre in anime. There have been many genres for vampire anime, but the best would probably be mystery and thriller. Shiki has the genre of thriller and mystery and I believed that it was brought out well throughout the anime. The plot started within the first episode and the suspense started growing. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe plot started off beautifully. It shows a young maiden that wants to achieve a dream that could never be reached. This is important because dreams are far from reality. Not only that, but we hope to achieve it. This is used to build up a bigger plot, the myth of deaths appearing in the village. This is pretty common when you see many people start dying suddenly in a small village. Not only that, but all the victims have two small marks. They were assumed insect bites\u2026What is there to expect except superstitions. \\n\\n\r\n\tAs hell breaks loose in the village, what is the possible answer for the massive death toll? The only solution is vampires. What do you call people that died, but rose to life again? What do you call people that hide in daylight? What do you call people that feed on human blood? The only answer is a vampire. The aspect of vampire in Shiki is the fact that each villager is dying, yet some are turning into a vampire. Shiki means corpse demon, but then again, it fits to the questions I said before. Shall humanity fall into the hands of vampire? Of course not, we shall be the hunters, not hunted. We shall not cower in fear and we shall fight against. We have always been the dominant species. As we journey through hell, Shiki was an everlasting journey that brought happiness and sadness.\\n\\n\r\n\tThere are many other situations beside the main plot. Those small plots are well put and they do connect with the main plot. I would say that the more I watch this anime, the more intense it gets. It is very dark and I enjoy the aspect of it. Besides the dark scenario, what else can we have by a one sided love? The love is to an extent to stalking. I feel as if I have to keep my windows closed and have the shutters on. Hold up; let me turn on my night light too in case. Besides that, we also have a situation of seeing families corrupt and how to adapt to changes. It is truly a sad thing to watch, but I have seen much of it already. I felt that the anime took the right approach that humanity must do whatever it takes to retaliate.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe art style is alright. I wouldn\u2019t say it is amazing, but if you look at it, the characters look extremely skinny for some reason. The hair styles are a bit weird, but some are fine. The colors are beautiful. I do love the color pink and they made Megumi look beautiful. Pink hair is just to kawaii. A bonus was that Megumi has twin tails. Megumi was the only character that I find favorable along with the doctor. Her character reminds me of Gasai Yuno from Mirai Nikki. You already know\u2026 \u201cYuuki-kun\u201d in a kawaii voice. It also happens in this anime too.  Now only if Megumi was a loli too\u2026 The eye colors are pretty too. The animation is pretty good. I have to give credit to the opening because the animation is high quality and well made. It wasn\u2019t what I expected. The scenes were similar to those from a horror movie as the flashing, the camera angle and the fading.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe music is appropriate for this anime. The goal was to bring out suspense and was able to achieve it. I feel like the first opening is impactful. When you watch the first episode, you want to have a good impression. While I was watching the first opening for the first time, I was amazed. The lyrics are suitable and it does explain portray future thriller scenes. The first ending took a different approach. It is a slow pace song which is my type. It is beautiful in its own way. The vocalist\u2019s voice is good. The piano is beautiful. I have always wanted to learn either piano or violin, but I didn\u2019t have the effort to put in. This is my loss, but I still admire great musicians. The lyrics for the first ending are quite vague, but it brings back to the topic of dreams. If you recall, dreams are far from reality. We hope that one day we achieve it. The second opening was alright. The animation is superb, yet the lyrics were unrelated. The second ending was meh. The lyrics are good, but the animation is like half assed. The animation is good. The OST is slow paced. Slow paced shows the horror that is upcoming. Since this is also a mystery genre, you would want to hear some eerie sounds. The music was able to fit my expectations.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe characters are ordinary I would say. It isn\u2019t like those characters that are perfectly made. First off, I would like to say that almost every character in this anime is important. Even though they are not the center of the spotlight all the time, they will have an impact on this show. The show starts off with a dark aura so there would be misfortune everywhere. There are antagonists, but I don\u2019t think I should cover it. It would be pretty confusing if I were to explain the aspects of the antagonists. I believe the protagonists contributed more to the story rather than the antagonists. There are four main characters that the story relies on. Each character is an important factor because we see the story with their views.  One of the main characters is Natsuno Yuuki. He was forced to live in a village and felt that he was out of placed. Due to this, he develops a cold behavior and tries to avoid anyone who gets close to him. We also have Toshio Ozaki. He is the doctor of the village and has to deal with all the cases of death. I would have to say that his character is the one that brought about the fear. Ozaki couldn\u2019t discover the causes of these deaths and blamed the fact that there are vampires. There is no solid proof\u2026 but the village is filled with fear.\\n\\n\r\n\tIf you like gripping onto horror, Shiki is for you. I honestly thought there was no \u2018scary\u2019 anime at all. I was told Another was scary, but it was alright. I wasn\u2019t terrified as much when I saw Shiki. The expressions the character had was true fear. I couldn\u2019t think, but the animations, the lighting and the disturbed radio waves\u2026 It was just too good of an anime. Another aspect I like about Shiki is the creative titles. They are pretty good and I enjoy the title scene. If you are interested in Shiki, you should watch Another or Hellsing Ultimate. Another is another great anime that shows thriller and mystery combined. Hellsing Ultimate shows the true power of vampires. Hellsing ultimate however takes more into the action genre rather than vampires and thriller. Though, they are both well made and should get a spotlight. Also, before you watch Shiki, it is very gruesome. If you are a light hearted person, you should stop and go find some pictures of cute puppies. This anime is for those who wants to see despair. I have always questioned the fact that humans won\u2019t survive till the end. After seeing Shiki, will humans still be the dominant species?\\n",

I've never found that many bunch of numbskulls in all the time I've watched animes. \r\n1. If you Know there are shiki/vampires in your village, make you a favor and don't go out at night; if you do, knowing that, carry at least with you some countermeasures like charms, crosses, Buddhas or whatever thing you may think that works against them. \r\n2. Vampiresneeds to kill people in order to survive, therefore they are killers (I'd daresay murderers) Killing people, murder is not as a grey area as one the main characters (the moral one) thinks and this anime depicts; it's something very bad, a crime, a sin... Once said this, I don't understand why one of the main characters, the one that should how to deal with demons, defend these creatures on the basis that they are beings on their need of surviving. Idiot, their survival means the dead of humans, your kin!!! family, friends...\\n\r\nThe conversations between the priest and the girl should be awarded as the most dangerous relativism pedant nonsense of the year...\\n\\n\r\n3. If your best friend, brother/sister, parent... has turned into a vampire; remember that he/she is no longer your kin; don't let him/she suck your blood out of sympathy, it's most likely that you'll regret it in the end. \\n\\n\r\nI thought that it was a serious anime when I started it, my mistake. My hopes for a mature story about vampires or demons, were turned down and flushed down to the privy by the author of this dumb light novel/manga/anime.",

Their conclusions trigger major changes in the plot that intensify the thrill and provide fuel for the psychological underlay.\r\nShiki provides a variety of sounds thatintensify the atmosphere and can keep the audience on the edge even if they are clueless morons. For such tasks there are haunting hymns, peculiar bits of modern music.\\n\\n\r\nSince the first episodes a great deal of characters are presented ,which have their moral portraits clearly defined, that receive screen time untill the end which is something unique considering that modern productions focus more on the protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I really liked Shiki wasn't because of the story or the gory scenes but because it actually poses pertinent questions for the viewer to ponder unlike some productions that are meant to be flashy and simply poke you in the eye.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you enjoy an anime that has a good degree of philosophical questions or simply has something that makes you ask yourself questions then Shiki would be a wise choice.",

Since there were girls there and me being the dumb teenage boy I was, I tried to sound badass by saying \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll get some holy water, a cross, a steak and we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d My friend who we will refer to as ScreamingCrazyTwilghtLoverSpendingEverydayStaringLonginglyAtHerEdward/BellePosterWhileWritingCreepyFanFictionsAboutGettingButtProbedByJacob or Twatzilla for short gave me a look like I just shat myself and tried to wipe the excrement onher leg and stupidly replied with \u201cThat won\u2019t do anything.\u201d I was dumbfounded. \u201cWhat do you mean it won\u2019t do anything? That\u2019s what you use to kill vampires.\u201d Twatzilla continued to give me this look like I had grown a third head out of my chest and it was cursing at her in some sort of alien language just insisted that \u201cNo you can\u2019t kill a vampire like that.\u201d Twatzilla then went on to explain all of the nuances of the Twilight saga to me as I continued contemplating the quickest way to make her shut her stupid fucking mouth.\\n\\n\r\n\tWell thankfully Shiki has nothing to do with that Twilight fagifying of vampires where they\u2019re just a bunch of mopey emo disco balls. They are by the book steak to the heart, can\u2019t go out in sun light, and must be invited in vampires. This may sound a bit spoiler-ish but one of the genres for the series straight up says \u201cvampire\u201d so if you didn\u2019t know that already you probably are the kind of person who likes to huff paint for fun.\\n\r\n\tNow I believe that story is pretty much generic. Some vampires move in, people start disappearing, a group of people who aren\u2019t pants on head retarded figure it out but no one believes them yada yada yada. So basic vampire affair but it does get some points in my book for keeping it to the traditional vampires but Shiki does take some liberties with vampires any way. Like remember how Dracula used to dress like he had just gotten off working the register at the local Hot Topic? Well these vampires tend to walk around in street clothes which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing but when one in particular vampire we\u2019ll just call her Whore-Tits McGee walks around in such little clothing that she would almost certainly be called out for public indecency you\u2019ve done something wrong. Another thing that\u2019s a bit fucked up is the hair of most characters, both humans and vampires alike. A disturbing amount of characters in Shiki seem to do their hair by stepping into a wind tunnel full of hairspray and moose, it almost makes me wonder if there isn\u2019t some chemical in the water that cause everyone\u2019s hair to have so some sort of weird erection. Then there is the one vampire who\u2019s built up to be like an unstoppable badass and could be used to great effect in scarring the shit out of people but he looks like he has two stalagmites growing out of his head which he is trying desperately to cover up with his hair and he dresses and acts a complete fag. I laughed out loud in one scene where he rode up on a motorcycle in some sort of maroon button up leather outfit that I would image a transsexual lesbian would wear and the best part was he had on a pair of sunglasses that could only be described as douche goggles and it was night time.\\n\r\n\tOne of the biggest let downs in Shiki is that it has a very inconsistent tone. Near the beginning it has a really creepy morbid feeling to it which I really found entertaining. It truly unnerving to see a girl previously thought dead to show up under your friend\u2019s bed and proceed to suck his blood without you being able to do anything about it. But then it starts to get more generic. It gets bogged down a lot with tons of worthless characters that I don\u2019t give a shit about and the worst part is when tragedy befalls them, they try to make you feel bad. It\u2019s really quite sad because what could have been a morbid depressing moment turns laughable because the characters are so poorly written I almost jump with joy every time one of them bites the dust in a gruesome way which probably reflects poorly on me as a person but that\u2019s beside the point. A lot of the middle of the show is spent wandering around in boredom waiting for everyone else to figure out what\u2019s going on even though it is painfully obvious. During the majority of the series it seems like nothing is happening like the series is just treading water trying to bide its time till the ending\\n\r\n\tAnd the ending incidentally is the worst part of this series. Now imagine that an anime is like a stuffed crust pizza. Shiki is a pizza that starts of delicious with your choice of unsettling toping but as you go one it start to taste like cardboard and then when you get to the crust you find that it\u2019s stuffed with a bunch of used condoms. So to sum it up Shiki is about a bunch of dodleing retards and flamboyant vampires fapping about doing nothing of interest. \\n",

Someone will be talking and the background will randomly start changing colours. It's very unique in its own way. That's the first thing that I noticed with this anime!\r\nNow, this show is interesting to say the least! After the first episode, I was definitely interested to watch more and find out what was going on. Basically in this show, tons of people are dying and the doctors can't seem to figure out why. And of course, logically, doctorswill try to find out what is happening and not even think about paranormal or supernatural possibilities, but when you're watching the show, you know that it has something to do with the strange family that has moved into town! \\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes are quite slow, almost like dodging the fact that something supernatural could be happening, but by episode 4, things really pick up and I was very excited to watch more!\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is a bit difficult to get used to. Especially their hair styles which seem to be sticking in all directions and in strange ways that you would never expect to see! Beside the fact that their hair is crazy, the details in the show are very well done, and like I mentioned, the strange colour changes make things more exciting and creepy in many ways. \\n\\n\r\nAlso! This show keeps to the supernatural ways! Vampires are Vampires! The kind that sucks people's blood and won't go into the sunlight kind of Vampires! It's difficult to find old-fashioned vampires these days! \\n\\n\r\nIf you're interested in supernatural plots or mysterious horror animes than this show is perfect for you! \\n",

            "content": "It fills my heart with joy whenever I see a horror series like Shiki.\r\nIt\u2019s atmospheric, it\u2019s subtle and furthermore, it doesn\u2019t rely on jump scares and copious amounts of bloodshed to shock its viewers. Instead, with masterful utilization of a remarkably eerie soundtrack and deliberate pacing, Shiki captures what makes a good horror series\u2026 good.\r\nOf course, Shiki is also aware that a good horror needs more than just well-executed music and pacing. It needs good characters.\r\nWhy should I care if Bob and Joe are ripped apart by werewolves? Why should I care if little Timmy is decapitated by one swift swing of a chainsaw? Whyshould I care if Mary Sue trips down the stairs and impales herself on an umbrella?\\n\\n\r\nThese are all questions we ask when watching a subpar horror flick and Shiki takes heed to those questions.\\n\\n\r\nShiki may be void of any real character development, but in similarities to a series like Baccano, it makes up for a lack development with strong characterization giving each character a distinct role, a personality and their own set motivations. But while Baccano\u2019s cast is remarkable for being a Hell of a lot of fun, Shiki\u2019s cast is remarkable for the amount depth implemented within them.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Shiki isn\u2019t really just a well-crafted horror series. It may start out like that in the beginning, but bit by bit it becomes a psychological drama delving into human morality and rationality. \\n\\n\r\nWhich side are you on? Humans or Shiki? \\n\\n\r\nQuestions regarding how far someone would go to survive, uphold justice or maintaining one\u2019s own humanity come into play and Shiki delivers these questions with fantastic intricacy. \\n\\n\r\nIts view - multifaceted and free of bias - goes beyond simply showcasing a black and white territory. It digs deep to expound on the question, grabbing perspectives from every angle, bringing in a grey area.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd never is Shiki pretentious or underwhelming. It constantly keeps the viewer both engaged with pondering over the morality of a character\u2019s action while building up to the perfect \u2013 I\u2019d rather not spoil it for you - ending.\\n\\n\r\nIts earlier half might be deemed too slow for many, but with episode 14 comes one of the most haunting scenes in the story-telling medium and from there on out, Shiki is flawless.\\n\\n\r\nNo episode left me without goose bumps tracing along both my arms and no episode left me without a couple shivers down the spine. Every episode rendered me speechless and aghast. Every episode had me at the very edge of my seat.\\n\\n\r\nThere were impeccably wrought twists and turns around every corner. Scenes of heart-breaking brutality and merciless murders haunted me. Acts of unexpected kindness and tenderness in the worst of times hit me straight in the heart.\\n\\n\r\nShiki clicked with me in a way few other anime have; Shiki\u2026 is phenomenal.\\n\\n\r\nDo I Recommend?: Without a second doubt. If you\u2019re looking for a compelling horror series, look no further. Have some patience with the first few episodes, the pay off is well worth it. Whether it\u2019ll leave an impact on you or not, I can\u2019t say, but it sure as Hell did for me.",

            "content": "As for someone who is big on horror, thriller, splice of life, etc, I find this anime rather hard to watch. I knew a lot of people who have watched it & found it amazing, so I gave it a shot, & by the end of watching it I was disappointed. As much as I wanted to like it I just couldn't. The characters are really just annoying, the main character was too typical emo styled, & well I'm not going to lie I felt the only person who had any credibility was the doctor, who I felt was a badass, all the other charactersjust seamed too mellow or too typical. The story was decent I give it that but after a while it started to get real dragged out & over time you just stop caring, there were some fucked up moments I give it that, but the story was just that, decent, not great, but not the worst, the way it ended just made me upset because in the end you want to know more about what happened to the other villagers. But here is the thing, who really cares about this story, as to you don't know what the characters were like before the incident happened, or hell even after, so therefore you couldn't care for them due to lack of flashbacks & character development, you get small backstory on some characters but that's about it, I also hated how they didn't really make the main character seam like the main character until later in the story, the artist & writer threw tits into the first episode to seam to get people watching, & well it seamed to work.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was decent, but it seamed low budget for something that had done so well as it did,enjoyable but low budget, there wasn't much to complain about.  The sound,as far as soundtrack it was good, seamed generic though, the japanese dub was decent for what it was, much prefered to the english dub, which the english dub also sounded low budget, surprisingly funimation didn't do a better job, the dub could have been better. I enjoyed the anime a little bit, but I doubt I will really go back to watch this anime,it just didn't leave a good taste in my mouth, maybe someone else will like this anime, but I didn't as much as I should have.",

            "content": "Vampires. Generally I'm not a fan of them as they mostly appear in comedies or shoujo anime. What I love about this anime is how it breaks-free from them while not becoming another Hellsing or Blood+ as well as it holds a rather similar vibe to Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni which I loved.\r\nStory: 10 - Recently a lot of people have been dying mysteriously in a secluded village which hasn't had a cure found. But all hell breaks out as the villagers start to realise that those 'dead' ones are actually 'alive' and are thriving for human blood. It could have turned into amess if it was executed in a different manner yet the way it actually turned out was one of the best consequences of the story. I loved the story a lot and the mystery really works out here with its kind of spookily looming atmosphere as it gives off a quiet yet fishy aura.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 - It was kind of different especially the character's eyes and it was hard to adjust to but it fits in perfectly with this type of anime. The character designs were good too as well as the character movements which didn't look odd which is an important thing for an anime with similar contents.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 - It had this creepy and a bit disturbing feeling which is a good thing as the OST, openings and ending songs were set at the right places. The seiyuus done a great job at capturing the characters carefully while making sure they don't mess up the aura.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 - The characters were great and they supported the story heavily which is what created the ending. I think most of the characters were great including main ones so I can't specifically pin point anyone.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 - I enjoyed this series a lot especially since it's my kind of thing but it's not recommended to everyone because it does have gore and some disturbing scenes, so this series won't be enjoyed by people who dislike that stuff.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who liked: Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni, Another, Highschool Of The Dead, Shinsekai Yori, Elfen Lied, Dance in the Vampire Bund, Umineko No Naku Koro Ni and Death Note will enjoy this series as there definitely is at least one similar aspect with those to this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 - It's a great series to watch for people who can watch gore and disturbing scenes. Overall it's definitely worth a watch even though it's a highly underrated series.",

            "content": "Even though we all know who the humans were and who the vampires were, one question still stands above all: Who were the true demons?\r\nOut of the vast sea of modern-day vampire stories, very rarely does a story about vampires stick to it''s true core: vampires. And by vampires I don't mean the romantic albino superhumans, the ecchi vampires (who barely pass as vampires), or even the badass characters from most shounen vampire animes. What I really mean when I say vampire is the classic 16th century vampire; the root story, if you please. These vampires don't get free superpowers that make them invincible, norare they instantly all powerful. These vampires lurk in the shadows. Like the tales told by many in 16th century London, these vampires are secretive, cunning predators who live off human blood - it's not a fun choice, it's a forced lifestyle. Get it? Once you become a vampire, well....you're a vampire! For better or worse.\\n\\n\r\nWhat exactly am I getting at? Well that's what Shiki is all about. The title, \"corpse demon\" is extremely representative of it's true nature. These vampires are not friends, nor are they to be trusted. To put it simply, they're demons. Let's get to the story:\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself, for being a tale about vampires, is very feasible, and what really struck home to me was how realistic the initial reception of the effects of the vampires are. There are none. As usual, the setting is in a small and confined rural town. At first, the vampire presence is simply a new disease to Ozaki Toshio, the trusted town doctor, a methodological man who is passionate about his work. Soon, it becomes an epidemic as body after body begins to pile up. Now, does he immediately find out the true cause of the \"epidemic\"? No. It takes a while, and even after he makes his decision he is reluctant to accept the truth. That's what makes this anime interesting and fresh.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main character is Yuuki Natsuno, a boy who has moved to Sotoba recently from the city. Yuuki is a very interesting yet important character, despite the fact that at no point does Yuuki actually contribute to the investigation of the disease or do anything to stop it (until very late in). His true role is to play the foil to doctor Toshio, experiencing the effects of the vampires torment on the town firsthand. You have your outside and methodological point of view, as well as your inside man, who experiences the fear first hand. \\n\\n\r\nSomething that makes the vampires really believable is the fact that they cannot walk into the sunlight. They have their weaknesses (be they smart, or rather silly). The other more important note that makes Shiki a believable story is the fact that, with only a few exceptions, no character is safe. Be it a new supporting character or a main character, anyone can go at any time.  \\n\\n\r\nArt is good, although the animation is choppy at a few scenes. Whether or not this is on purpose or accidental is a center of controversy, but I felt that body movements fit the mood of the story. The voice acting is superb, and quite believable, if it's the strong, fearful, or the weak and feeble. The OPs are quite addictive and match the plot well, so hats off to the bands. Background music fits the mood almost all the time with eerie music and nice sound effects that are fitting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development deserves an honorable mention as well, as Shiki does a good job at playing psychological angles. Whether you're watching the doctor slowly grow cold, the priest sympathetic, resolves strengthening, or hearts being broken, Shiki never fails to succeed. Biases and stereotypes that run about the idea of a small town are, for the lack of a better word, scary. I nearly shit myself and my blood ran cold when I saw how easily and quickly the townspeople had adapted to the vampires and the slaughter. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I must say, Shiki is a list topper for me. The smart plot and the characters really set it in stone. Fear-wise though, the horror in Shiki is absolutely nothing compared to the psychological fear. The moral dilemmas the characters are presented with and the instinct to survive are in constant conflict, making it thought provoking yet cold-hearted. How quickly the humans adapt to becoming vampires, killing (on both ends), and the choice to die or survive makes this show truly entertaining to watch. It is quite honestly the best anime I have seen in a long time. No one should hesitate to watch it, and I'll see you in my next review.",

            "content": "The Story of Shiki essentially focuses on this isolated community living in this isolated town and one day a new family moves and right after that strange things start to happen...One by one people are dying from a strange illness and nobody seems to know why?..As if that was not the only problem other strange stuff start to occur..People acting strangely...Some of them go missing...quieting there jobs...moving away with no explanation and the strangest of them all...those who have died are supposedly coming back to life but not as they were once were.\r\nThe story itself is pretty much what i described above without going intospoiler territory be warned from here on out this review will have spoilers and so a word of Caution is advised.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is more or less a vampire story and came out at a time where vampires where at a storm in fandom, however unlike other series this one takes on the more traditional approach to the myth and is more of a welcome place for a genre that has been so twisted and changed that is hard to keep with what anymore. \\n\\n\r\nIt focuses on 4 main characters: The doctor Toshio Ozaki who is probably the character that got most development in this story is the one trying to figure out what is going and how to stop this crisis that affects the town. ( he is he representation of the human side) \\n\\n\r\nSunako Kirishiki the Leader of the Shiki another name for what people would describe as vampires, she has her eyes set on the town and comes up with a plan to turn the whole populace into a Shiki village so as to finally have a place to belong and be accepted along with the rest of her family who moved with her.( She represents the Shiki side). \\n\\n\r\nThan u have Natsuno Yuuki the city boy who is not fond of the town where he is staying and is very unsociable and distant but cares for the few people he cares with out most heart, he is turned later into a Shiki but still tries to stop there plans( he represent the turned Shiki still holding out to there humanity).\\n\\n\r\nFinally we have Seishin Muroi the local monk who never felt like he truly belonged or like the position he was within the village and is also a writer of series of book which Sunako is a fan off and after spending some Time with here realizes what he truly wants and voluntarily to be turned into a shiki( he represents people turned into shiki who reject cast off there humanity).\\n\\n\r\nThe Art itself of this show is quite unique compared to the standard animation, for a series that focuses on a more horror genre it is surprisingly bright colored but don't let them turn you off..cause the art and animation is simply wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nThe design of the people are in reminiscent of those u see from the works of Clamp but not so exaggerated as the former. The thing they might the most of putting about would most likely be the crazy hairstyles and pointed chins that the majority of cast has...B\\n\\n\r\nut the background art is well done and the designs of the characters are all unique and original and u can easily identify each character without much difficulty and than the horror sequences combined with excellent music composition can leave creeped out and even scared at times...especially if u watch this in dark ...\\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack...Oh Wow the Soundtrack if there is anything that comes close to being 10/10 it would be the music composition of the show..usually when u have an anime series there might be one or two ost that u might like and ignore the rest but in this case all of the ost composition are the best of the best.\\n\\n\r\nEach single track is never out of place and sinkcranizes so well with each other to the horrifying and creepy ost-Pendulumn to the sheer utter despair and sadness ost-Day and Night...even the intro and ending themes are something to behold both for teh first half and second half intro's and ending are great which is rare to find these days.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: Oh boy this is were the series seems to get a lot of divided opinions mostly due to huge cast arrangement there is within this show as well as how that affects there development.\\n\\n\r\nSome i can agree with cause not all of them have enough screen time or others just disappear and reappear between various points within the story but the biggest of them all is probably has to do with there behaviors with dealing the mentioned crisis that is effecting the town and really puts you in a situation to understand the very foundation of morals and makes u wonder what u would do in that situation for both sides perspective and if u combine all of it together there is no right or wrong just shade of grey for both parties.\\n\\n\r\nTo give an idea about this here are some character details and how each one is affected and how there actions can be either wrong ..right or in between:\\n\\n\r\nTruth Be told...i don't Think Either side was Wrong and Neither was Right. Huh if u look at the big picture both the Shiki and human were in the right and wrong on a lot of things.\\n\\n\r\nThe Shiki were a race of beings that were outside of there nature but nobody within their ranks ever truly wanted to be turned into shinki in the first place...\\n\\n\r\nSome of them definitely deserved to be eliminated as they rather enjoyed the ability to kill and contempt and were even killing out of necessity rather for there enjoyment such as Megumi, Tatsumi, Atsushi Ookawa and Masao Murasako were all just rotten to the core.\\n\\n\r\nWhile others such as Tooru Mutou, Nao Yasumori and Ritsuko Kunihiro were left with no real choice and had to kill not out of joy but out of survival. \\n\\n\r\nNao killed her family off in order to at least make them part of her new life as she did not want to be alone but ultimately failed, \\n\\n\r\nTooru was too overwhelmed with hunger and could never control it and\\n\r\nRitsuko was probably the strongest will to choose death rather than become the monster she has become.\\n\\n\r\nAS for Sunako's case she is both a villain and a Tragic character...Her Plan to turn an entire village for shiki spread from a desire to find a place to belong and find a new family to accept her after being left abandoned and than alone for over a century and more. \\n\\n\r\nYes she was bit merciless and a bit brutal but at the same time u can't but help with sympathizing with her after all that has happened u can understand at least to some extant as to why she did what she did even if it would never have worked.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Natsuno Koide he may seem like an ass because he is unsociable but that is more or less to do of being forced into situations and brought to this place out of other people chocies ( his parents) Also with the fact that people were judging him ( villiagers) and he wanted to get out..Tooru and a few of the others were his only real friends and he really did care for them,\\n\\n\r\nit was Tooru's death and than turning him into a shiki against his will was the main reason he wanted vengeance..\\n\\n\r\n.After he himself got turned, even tough he got the better option he still wanted to destroy them cause of what they did and he resented what he became cause it made him feel like he was also part of them. that is why he took his own life but took the others with them as he felt he never wanted to be part of the shiki but he could never return to being truly human.\\n\\n\r\nNow on the Human's Side first of all u got the Toshio Ozaki he was a guy who cared for his patients and all the people around him and he so desperately wanted to save everyone he could, he saw the shiki were a threat to the humans and rightful so as they were compelling to kill everyone one out of there own interests.\\n\\n\r\nhe was pushed to the limit with the death of his own wife( before u say about her treatment after that let me explain) ...Yes his wife died and yes his methodology to find out about the shinki were morally questionable but in all honesty after all the deaths and all the suffering and with this one chance to find out your enemies weakness did he really have any other choice? if u were in the position and i mean truly in that position ask yourself what u would have done?\\n\\n\r\nHis leading the whole villagers and taking down the shiki was brilliant and necessary if u were a human population and faced a threat u had to do u can in order to survive and sometimes that might mean sacrificing your own humanity although to be fair he was not a villain to the shiki as he neighter enjoyed killing, it was just a matter of survival and anger( you lose your wife and friends u would be pushed to the limit too)\\n\\n\r\nSome of the other villagers in there treatment of the Shiki was really harsh and some even relished and prolonged the kills which makes them yes a bit more villianry others were just scared and horrified and the same time anger filled them in there hearts and with all those factors can u really blame them for doing to what they did to the Shiki? it may have been wrong as to how some were treated but most of them were forced into that situation which was way out of control.\\n\\n\r\nThan u have the priest Seishin Muroi while yes i can see how soem people might see him as a traitor and yes a bit hypocritical in his philosophy about killing and murder after what he did but if u take a step back and anaylize it a bit more, he was more or less just speaking about the morallity of what others tough of and compelled him to do what they wanted. \\n\\n\r\nhe never wanted to be a priest and he was so influenced by his family tradition that he must have thought he was trapped and continued to bear the judgment of others rather than himself when he talked with Sunako about his books and feelings i think at some point he must have realized what he truly wanted and took the opportunity to finally escape it all and he choose to be a Shiki as he always felt he was more dead than alive and being a Shiki was more close to what he truly was than how others forced him to be.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line though is that there is no real bad or good things in either cases, this whole thing was set to fall apart from the start, it just had to build up into a climax that in the end due to the conflict of both parties led to the ruin of most parties hence the symbolism of the village being destroyed and both the Shiki and human due the conflicts with each other destroyed themselves. but that is up to you to decide...\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict: This series is an excellent Story that it's central focuses at least the way i see it the morality of a person and how or she reacts in a situation forced upon that is way beyond anyone's control and in the end there is no way out without at least sacrificing a part of your humanity to do so..but it asks you how much and how far are you willing to go before yourself become what u despise...\\n\\n\r\nIS the monster born a monster simply because u have to live as a monster to stay alive? or is monster turned into a monster cause it u run into a situation with no option but to be a monster to survive?..\\n\\n\r\nThat is the very basis of this story...Also if u want a more traditional vampire story and in need of a good horror and mystery series i recommend shiki as one you should try out...you will not be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nOver all:8.75/10 show less\\n",

            "content": "This is a spoiler-free review.\r\nI watched Shiki 3 times, and every time I rewatched, I liked a little more.  I'm going to try my best to explain, why I like this show so much.\r\nWe can start with the plot. The story is kind of simple, but works really well, basically, we have this calm small village called Sotoba, a place isolated by mountains, a place who never happens nothing unnusual, people have their families, their jobs, the fathers die before the sons, and life goes on, but one day people start to get \"sick\" from something that even the doctors can't explain, and eventualy,die. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I like more about Shiki, is the atmosphere created by the anime, even if for us as spectators, the mystery can sound a little bit silly, we have to understand that for the characters, the fact of the deaths are being caused for something supernatural, sounds really absurd, after all, they are normal people, like us, and they only understand after the truth are really in front of their eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe storytelling is built slow, sounding like a mysterious slice of life, at the first episodes the anime introduce us to the characters and their families. Constantly we see Toshio, our main character, working at the hospital, and visiting sick people, and day after day we can see how all type of people are dying from nothing, since olds to even children, and all of this create an great atmosphere of insecurity and mistrust.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not the big deal here, they are not bad at all, but their have nothing of incredible, most of them have their big moment to shine, of course, the ones who have more opportunity, like Toshio, are the stars here. Sunako and Seishin have good moments and good dialogues throughout the show, between them and with other characters too, Toshio, Sunako and Seishin are good characters with good conflicts. But in general, the characters are just ok.\\n\\n\r\nWell, in overall, Shiki is a really catchy anime, you are going to want to see what is going to happen next, the mystery and the atmosphere is really good, even if we are in front of the characters, we need to know how they are going to react to at is happening. Shiki is not an exemple of innovation, the story about how humans can be so bad as the real \"bad\" ones, was told before, but this time was told really well.\\n\\n\r\nLast things, the sounds is great, both openings and endings are awesome, the best is the second ending called Gekka Reijin, awesome song who fits perfectly with the anime. The animation is solid, but the art can be a little weird at the beginning, the characters hairs are really awkward, but in one or two episodes you are going to be ok with it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, go on and watch Shiki, I'm sure you are going to enjoy it. See ya!",

            "content": "Am I the only one who thinks the whole \"humans doing inhuman things\" as really trite and cliche?\r\nWell, if you think that this is an utterly original and deep idea, then I have the show for you: It's Shiki, where the vampires don't sparkle but do rival the Cullen's tendency toward being vanilla as hell.\r\nShiki's main praise seems to be that it isn't Twilight and it's more about traditional vampires. However, most of the people who say this have no knowledge about traditional vampires in the first place so you shouldn't put too much stock in that.\r\nNo, the switch midway through to the humans beingthe \"bad guys\" doesn't make this show intelligent. Perhaps if it was executed decently, you might be able to argue this but Shiki doesn't manage that. \\n\\n\r\nDoctor Osai has been the most interesting and sympathetic character throughout the show and trying to paint him in a negative light doesn't work when the rest of the characters are pants-on-head retarded. Seriously, what the hell is the Monk even on about? How does Cain-and-Abel-are-one-and-the-same make any sense? What does that have to do with anything? The vampires are never fleshed out other than being either total douchebags or struggling vampires who don't want to kill but totally do anyways.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the OPs suck. They fail at being scary or creating a mood or being halfway interesting.",

            "content": "If someone asked me what is this show about, I'm pretty sure there's only one word I would use to describe it. That word wouldn't be action, or romance, or horror. It would be one word, often underused, feelings.\r\nThis show, at least in my opinion, is all about feelings. By the end of the show (took me 2 days to finish it) I didn't know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. I just know what I felt about them. I felt sad for the losses of the \"good guys\", but in the same time, I felt sad over the sh?tthat happened to the \"bad guys\".\\n\r\nBut, one topic at a time.\\n\\n\r\nStory [9]:\\n\r\n-> Brilliant. That would be short version of it. Story didn't follow one or two characters (although anime description said there are 2 main characters) but it followed them all. It's not really original story to have mysterious murders in a far, secluded village, but what is original is how they presented it, how well explained the background of things is and how well the characters are presented. All that made quite a unique story which didn't really falter at any moment, it kept going. My only issue overall with this anime is that it starts with a boom (so to say), it starts extremely fast (but not missing anything) and than it somewhat slows down towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt [8]:\\n\r\n-> Well, it's not bad, but again, it's not anything special either. Characters are really well drawn and \"background\" are always lively, so there's no complain there. However, problem here is that, while great, it sometimes wanted to be artistic where artistic wasn't needed. Don't get me wrong, there are some wonderful scenes where only black and white techniques were used, but sometimes they were just out of context and not really needed or appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10]:\\n\r\n-> This is one area where I have zero complains. Everything, starting from opening and ending songs to voice acting is great. Character voices are numerous, never hard to recognize or bland. There are \"feelings\" in those voices, their pain and suffering is heard. Music in the background never interferes with what's happening in foreground and yet it's almost impossible to ignore it since it presents things happening with great passion. Great soundtrack, great voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [9]:\\n\r\n-> I wanted to rate this with 10, but some minor complains popped up on my mind. The show starts off strong, presenting character traits, their strong and weak points, but somehow, by the end, those traits are forgotten and they become the usual clich\u00e9 types of characters. Again, don't get me wrong, there're no real \"good\" or \"bad\" guys in this show, it's just that some characters which started off strong get VERY little screen time later on, never really explaining their role in all the things happening. Pitty.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10]:\\n\r\n-> As per usual, not going to comment on this one too much. Each person has its own tastes. For me, this show was great, I loved every second of it, even though I felt disappointed by the ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [8]:\\n\r\n-> Yes, even I can't find too strong  a reason why I gave this show such strong marks in all the fields and rated it with 8. I guess biggest problem with this show is that it ended abruptly and without really finishing many \"arcs\". So many things remain open and so many characters remain unfinished it's a huge shame. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is a must-see as it is, and it could have been so much more if only 1 more episode came out. That still doesn't change the fact it's a great show.",

            "content": "\"Is it a sin to want to live?\"\r\nWords that were carved deep into my mind after watching Shiki. You might be thinking what a silly question that is of course everyone is entitled to a life and that would never be considered a crime. Well Shiki took these words and dug deep into the matter of what is right and what is wrong, leaving us with sincere questions on what are we all, as human beings, doing here? Are we all right because we're rational beings or are we the worst animals of all?\r\nThis anime was the first vampire anime i decided to watch. I'mnot very fond of vampires mainly due to the western idea of friendly vampires that coexist with people. If you're looking for that kind of vampires, you're looking at the wrong show. Shiki managed to bring back the terrifying expirience that encountering vampires is and showed all the gore and carnificine that all real vampires display in serious horror shows. Not only that, it attempted to show what it feels like for a vampire, a seemingly horrifying and with no mercy monster, to have self consciousness, to be aware of its own existence and aware of all other creatures around it. This was a premise that led to an amazing anime experience.\\n\\n\r\nTo start off we have very distinct unique main characters. What made me enjoy this from the start was that none of the main characters were dense and couldn't figure out what was going on, even the seemingly rational doctor has enough brain matter to understand what's happening, this was promising as far as character goes. We have the monk Seishin to act as the role of religion in the series, even though he himself is aware of what's happening. We have the doctor Toshio that is initially a rational human but we discover later that there is dementia deep down inside him. Then our main hero Natsuno who is an anti-social city boy, but he's defenitely not stupid and he is what defines a line between a real human and a monster. And at last Sunako, the vampire master sort of who shows us what being a vampire is like, what is it all about and how much pain and suffering does one actually have to endure to be a \"monster\" .\\n\\n\r\nThis extraordinary cast of main characters will show different prespectives through out the story that will keep the viewer wondering which side is right, the human side or the vampire side. We get to see the ugly side of humanity and what would most likely happen in a scenario similar to Shiki's. We also get an insight on the entire vampire society and what it means to be one, vampires that can't go in the sunlight and are terrified of religious ornaments, that kind of vampires, not the type of vampire that can walk in the sun as if nothing was going on. This amazing plot is what truely makes Shiki an enjoyable yet terrifying experience, and makes us think about ourselves as living creatures.\\n\\n\r\nAs if the plot wasn't enough the art is visually shocking. The insane amount of gore and carnage and the eerie looking vampires. This show is not here to show you cute characters that you would want to hug. On the contrary it's main purpose is to creep the viewer out, to make us who are watching want to watch the show not for the adorable characters but for the story and plot. If this was the intent well i must admit they have nailed it. The first time a vampire appeard on screen, as I saw its deep dark eyes with glowing red corneas my back shivered, it really was eerie and if a show can do that just by the art quality well it just gets more points from me. You will not get tired of seeing new vampires because each and every one of them has their share of creepyness.\\n\\n\r\nGoing more into the physical aspects we're left with the sound. The opening and ending themes were spot on as well as the entire opening and ending sequence. Not only these but the sound effects during the actual show and the intense music during certain flashback scenes or quick events all are fitting into the environment and won't let you disappointed. When i say sound effects i mean bones cracking, veins being sliced, strange voices inside one's head. These were used to one again enhance the eerie aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nFor dropping conventional western ideals of vampires and using real blood thirsty creatures and also for an amazing and unique cast that gives us an insight on all different prespectives of a \"vampire apocalypse\", Shiki is without a  doubt one of the most well produced vampire and horror animes, it will not get boring as the story progresses, the slow paced development in the beginning is only the tip of the iceberg and I'm more than glad i did not drop this anime because it was a thrill from the beginning to the end.\\n\\n\r\nSo \"is it a sin to want to live?\" even if you have to kill someone every day in order to live, even if you have a choice not to kill but your entire body is forcing you to and you're doomed to an eternity of killing and murder? Is it right to call creatures that suffer this much monsters? Are we all that much better as humans for trying to survive by killing so called \"monsters\"? All these questions will be present through out the show and I promise you if you are looking for an amazing vampire series, you are in for a treat by watching Shiki.\\n",

            "content": "I finished watching this anime yesterday at 2 AM and when I did until 2:30 AM I just stared at the screen trying to assimilate the last 5 episodes. I was like: OMGx2 or something. \r\nNow the review its self.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe way how the story evolves is really cool. Some might call it slow but I think that this is the way an semi-horror anime should indeed evolve. Because of the few details that the story gives it rely makes a chill run down you're spine and u fell like u sneaked you're nose where u should not. But in the end what reallymatters is on who's side you are at the very end (and neutrality is not allowed, believe me).\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nAll the special effects are wonder full made. The way the characters are drawn is also quite good, especially strange / horror scenes. Also the landscapes are realistic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nI didn't particularly listened to the songs so I shouldn't comment here but I DID liked the 2nd opening:\"Calendula Requiem\" by kanon x kanon (eps 12-22).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nAlthough there were some super twisted and some times crazy characters (semi-horror anime so I think it's understandable ) there were also some very good ones. Most of theme were something between and their personalities were very close to the real human ones. And what they done shows us what COULD happen IF we would let the fear and the thirst for revenge to lead us.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nWell here it depends how u define \"enjoyment\". It's that chill that makes you're stomach go to you're throat? Or its pure happiness. I don't know how to define MY enjoyment bu I know when I feel it and when I watched this show I definitely felt a blast in some moments  and I wanted to curse some times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIts a very good anime and if u like supernatural stuff u should definitely watch  it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Few anime are as unique and interesting as Shiki, a series which has taken the vampire genre and turned it into something very special. Right from the start, Shiki feels very different from the usual anime fare, especially when it comes to its look. The art is great, but what\u2019s striking about the anime is the character\u2019s appearance. There are a lot of characters in this one, but what\u2019s so impressive is that they all have their own unique look\u2014the odd hairstyles will definitely turn some off, but I always found it to be one of the things that make the series so beautiful anddistinct in appearance.\\n\\n\r\nShiki takes place in the quiet and peaceful village of Sotoba, where a mysterious and wealthy family moves in during one summer. What follows is a series of inexplicable deaths that mark the start of a chain of events that will ultimately change the once harmonious village forever. Shiki follows a story that is well-crafted and tells several intertwined conflicts that come face to face sooner or later. As mentioned before, there are tons of characters to be found in this anime, but few actually feel underdeveloped. All of them have a purpose and rarely do we stumble upon a character that is not interesting\u2014that\u2019s just how well-written Shiki actually is.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an undeniable sense of progress driving this anime. At first, it\u2019s all about a mysterious event in a seemingly harmless village devoid of any unusual activities, but it slowly escalates towards something much bigger and a lot more engaging. By the time Shiki is finished, it will have evolved so much that you\u2019d be surprised if you took a second look at the first few episodes. On a different note, it\u2019s also worth mentioning that this anime can feel quite unconventional and odd at times, which might turn some viewers off. It has a strange way of going about things, that\u2019s for sure, but its distinctive traits are what make Shiki so special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters die, new ones are introduced and some become more or less important over the course of this anime, but not one is overlooked or forgotten. Amongst the most significant ones are Toshio Ozaki, the doctor in charge of the local hospital, Natsuno Yuuki, a teenager who moved to the countryside with his parents but hates living in the village, and Seishin Muroi, a local priest who also writes novels. These are but a few in a line of fascinating and unique characters, many of which play a pretty even role throughout the anime. It\u2019s hard to consider which ones are the main characters in Shiki, but for me the three mentioned above seem to play the most important part.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Shiki\u2019s story may be one of a kind, it\u2019s also one that tends to feel a little dull in certain parts. The investigation of the mysterious events that happen throughout the anime may be a little overlong and mostly dialogue-oriented, but once the reveal kicks in, things start to move a lot faster and more and more action fills up every episode. What\u2019s so captivating about Shiki is the way it portrays the relationship between vampires and humans, and how these two sides come in different conflicts as they each try to fight for survival. It gets quite brutal at times, but it never feels gratuitous or unbearably violent, instead always keeping a precise aim at what the anime wants to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s really not much else to say about Shiki, other than the fact that it\u2019s a breath of fresh air in the vampire genre, which is becoming more and more exploited every day. Not many manage to capture such a wonderfully unique image of vampires as this series does and that alone makes it worth the watch. For a better experience, those deciding to give Shiki a try should first be aware that this anime is quite a different beast from the usual fare, but it is also a very rewarding path to take, for Shiki is certainly one of the best anime series of the year.",

            "content": "Well, this is my first review, but I'll try to make it worth reading. What brought me to this anime is that I really enjoyed the anime Higurashi no naku koroni and Shiki was one of the recommended animes that was supposedly similar to Higurashi.\r\nStory: (9/10)\r\nSo basically, the story is set in a small village called Sotoba. People start dying mysteriously and it's mainly told through the point of view of Yuuki Natsuno, Ozaki Satoshi, and Muroi Seishin, as well as a few other characters. The viewer knows what's going on, but the characters don't know of the existence of Shiki until a little bitlater into the anime. I thought the story was pretty unique, except the whole small town setting seemed some what clich\u00e9 to me, so that's why I give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a bit strange, as in the hairstyles are a bit weird. When I watched the first episode, I was actually really put off by the hair, even to the point to where I considered dropping the first episode because it bugged me so much. But I decided against it. Once you get used to it, the art is actually very unique, which I really like. The hair isn't just the standard long, flowing girly hair you typically see, it has character to it. It almost gives characters their own individuality. So don't be too put off by the art, you'll come to appreciate it more as the series progresses. The backgrounds, too, were done nicely. They weren't sloppily done and actually looked really good. I give the art a 9 only because the art style wasn't something I was used to at the beginning of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was fantastic. I thought it went along very well with the theme of the anime. Some of the songs on the soundtrack had a creepy, gothic feel to it which I thought went along great with the vampire genre of this anime. The music was also played appropriately with certain scenes. During comedic scenes, there would be a more upbeat song to match the mood. I also enjoyed the opening and ending songs a lot. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were damn cool. For once, in an anime, there weren't any characters I hated. At first Megumi kind of pissed me off, but in the end I thought she was pretty cool. The main characters in this anime and even some of the reoccurring characters have nice background stories, nobody was really left out save for a few people. The characters also had awesome and different personalities. No two were the same. I give it a 9, though, because even though their back stories were explained, I still thought they could have gone into a bit more detail with them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI can guarantee you that if you enjoy vampire stories or the whole vampire concept in general, you'll like this anime. It's not too bloody, which was kind of disappointing for me, but it has just enough blood in it to satisfy you. I loved this anime and it is definitely an anime I will come back to in a few years and watch again. It is re-watchable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, story, art, and sound were all incredible. This was a damn good anime. If you like Higurashi or anything like it, you'll love this anime. It has mystery, vampire, and even religious themes to it. Even the few comedic moments it has you'll love. I found them to be hilarious. Also, this anime has a bit of a gothic feel to it, especially the way Sunako dresses. It's cute. So give this anime a try, and I'm sure you'll fall in love with it!",

            "content": "Finally, a horror story that gets it right!\r\nIn recent years, across all media, there has been a distinct lack of good horror. It seems that the entertainment industry has decided \u2018horror = jump-scares\u2019 (this is a generalization; there have been some good ones come out, but too few in my opinion). This mentality leads to very little plot and/or character development; leaving the audience slightly shocked but otherwise unfazed. Why should you care what happens to characters that you have been given no chance to make a connection with?\r\nAnd then there\u2019s Shiki-\r\nPeople may find the first half of Shiki too slow for their liking. Butthe slow build up is exactly what makes this anime so great. You will get to learn about the characters, create a connection with them, and actually care what happens to them (for better or worse). I have seen many anime that suffer from an abundance of filler episodes. Shiki doesn't do this. What it gives you is a well drawn-out story with every episode progressing the story. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything so I will simply say that the payoff for your patience in the beginning is a thrilling ending.\\n\\n\r\nShiki plays on your emotions, and questions your ideas of morality. It does a great job of leaving you questioning who the monsters are, if any. You will most likely have a love/hate relationship with many of the characters, which only makes the story better.\\n\\n\r\nI think Shiki is brilliant, and it is definitely one of the best vampire stories I have seen or read. I especially like the Bram Stoker style mythology for the vampires. However, that doesn\u2019t mean it is without flaws. I mostly found the negatives with the story bearable just because to me they were minor compared to all the positives. One of the negatives, which is solved partly by the Shiki Specials*, is that I thought the ending could have been drawn out a little longer in order to resolve a few characters storylines.\\n\\n\r\nLastly I\u2019d like to make special mention of the music, which really added another dimension to Shiki. It is very well done and creates a fitting atmosphere for the story to play out in.\\n\\n\r\n*If you watch and like Shiki then you have to watch the Shiki Specials. Along with giving a proper end for some of the characters, there is also one of the most emotionally powerful scenes I have seen in anime.\\n",

            "content": "I had never felt so conflicted about an anime before. This is really an anime that highlights the gray that is hidden between the black and the white. And it is an anime that will make you feel so hollow yet compels you to come back and suffer more. Yes. This is an anime that is full of suffering for both sides; in this game, nobody wins.\r\n-SPOILERS (kind of)\r\nThis anime is one about vampires. No, it's not a romance like anime that shows how the cute vampire cures his addiction and falls in love. I'm pretty sure you all have heard that over and overagain from the other viewers but seriously, this anime is what any vampire anime should be about; the relationship between them and the humans they prey on. The plot very good, it kept me on my toes but some points were predictable. What really made this anime tick for me was its wide selection of characters. \\n\\n\r\n\" You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view [\u2026] until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.\" Sure this is a quote from TKAM, but it really defines what the anime is really about. Many of these people seem like dicks at first, but they have a reason and motive for being that way. The Shiki are feared because they are so misunderstood and of the abundance of fear on both sides. There is little to no difference between the Shiki and the humans on an emotional level.\\n\r\nExcept for Masao- he's always going to be a coward and an idiot no matter what. \\n\\n\r\nWho is right? Kill all vampires because they feed on humans. They're evil no matter what right? We have the right to kill them because they eat us. \\n\\n\r\nWho is right? Shiki have to kill humans because we would die if we didn't. We need their blood otherwise we wouldn't do anything to harm regular people. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no right and wrong in this anime, that's what it's trying to exemplify throughout the entire series. Throughout the entire piece, it shows that both sides suffer and there isn't any way to sneak past the pain. There is no wildcard that can save both. I hate to say it, but this anime could also be extended not only to vampires. This has happened in the past in real life. And it is still happening now in our world today. Sure people don't go around staking other people, but they do talk about others, kill mothers and fathers, rape children, and tear families apart. And at least the Shiki grant a more peaceful passing then the violent ones that occur everyday. \\n\\n\r\nWho are the real monsters in this world? Is it the ones hiding inside us? Or the ones that walk among us?\\n\\n\r\n-End Spoilers\\n\\n\r\nArt: I actually did not like the art at first. Seishin looked like a bug or some type of alien. Dr. Okazaki looked pretty similar to Natsuno so I kept mistaking them for father and son. But after a while, I didn't really care anymore because of the awesomely crafted individuals in the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: From the very first episode, I knew that something was going to go wrong because of the music. Sure there was the obvious love dovey girl that was really annoying, but the music was the thing that tipped me off that something ominous was coming. I actually thought the first OP and ED were very well done, but the second OP didn't really fit. The 2nd ED was okay though. I can't really judge seiyuu because I'm not a speaker of Japanese but I could feel the emotion and pressure that weighed down every character. The screams were so horrifically real that I literally cringed in my chair.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It was horrible. I watched the characters in this show grow, be happy, and it tore it all down within a few episodes. I got so freaked out at the end of the 4th episode I just got up and out of my room. It was horrible, but I loved every second of it. Sure I may have lost my faith in humanity a few dozen times, but seriously, this is an anime that everybody should watch.\\n\\n\r\nLast of all, I want to thank Deknijff for recommending this anime to me. It's been a hell of a ride and I'm glad that I stuck with it. Thanks for the discussions you've given me and I hope that we'll have lots more in the future. \\n",

            "content": "Shiki series happened to be a huge suprise for me since before watching it I was in some kind of depression because all the shows I checked lately simply didn't interest me. They all seemed stereotypical, predictable and boring... they simply lacked something.\r\nAlso in the past almost all high praised shows that I have watched happened to be a dissapointment so I didn't expect much from this, especially since vampires are not really the theme that interests me that much.\r\nHowever, I was proven wrong. For the first time I found the whole vampire concept really interesting. I actually learned some new facts about vampires whichI didn't know before like for example \"They can't enter the house unless invited\". The backstory on their life actually made me feel sorry for them instead of being amazed or bored like before.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole story starts in small village where sudenlly people start to die and during that crisis a new family arrives into a mansion that everyone found to be out of place. Dr. Ozaki assumes that it is the epidemic but is it so?\\n\\n\r\nWe mostly have 3-4 main heroes in the village and everyone has their own part in the story. Everyone thinks differently and takes different actions which have different results. Whose are most effective? That's for you to decide.\\n\\n\r\nOver all series have a lot of characters, to the point that not everyone get enough screen time and development. However, in comparison to other shows it is not a minus. Somehow you still are able to feel for the charactes, to worry for them or hate them.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being quiet predictable you still are on the edge of your sit, wanting to see what will happen next. I myself am re-watching series right now and despite knowing about all the events, there still are momets which I want to see again and again, which make me feel, get worried and sometimes frustrated with some characters actions. Nice animation and music placement get you drown in.\\n\\n\r\nThis series deal with morals and ethics, at first you are on the human side but once you get to the core of Shikis' lifes, you start to doubt your original thoughts... you start to think \"So who is the real monster? Them or us, humans?\"! Some scenes become hard to watch on emotional scale.\\n\\n\r\nSeries have some very nice soundtracks, some of them I could actually call my faves and I think that they all suit with the mood of the series.\\n\\n\r\nColours are quiet dull, not bright, most likely to suit the mood and I think it works. The only complain would be some weird character designs,mostly hairstyles but you do get used to them, and really obviouse black eyes which make you want to scream \"Look into their eyes! They are not humans!\"\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason why I didn't give this series 10 is because quiet a few things are left un-answered by the end of the series and sadly those questions happen to be the ones to which you want to know the answer.\\n\\n\r\nOver all, If you love mysteries and dark series, this is a must.\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of vampires, real vampires, it is even bigger must! \\n\r\nIf you don't like vampires, I still will say to give this series a try. It might change your looks on vampires.\\n\r\nSeries don't have much action like all those other vampire series like Blood+, Rosario+Vampire, Vampire knight... but you won't be bored if you care for the story and good development. However, if mindless action with constant power ups is what you want to see, avoid the series.\\n\\n",

Shows like Higurashi, Elfen Lied, etc. - although good shows in their own right - were a sort of glass ceiling that served to bound the entire genre. Making a horror show more engaging, terrifying, entertaining, gruesome, and heartfelt than that was unheard of - neigh impossible.\r\nShiki, however, completely shattered my expectations. The opening theme of the anime beckons the viewer to partake of the terrifying yet somehow gruesomely beautiful world of Sotoma. To this day, those dark soulless eyes that pool themselves on the eyes of some of the female charactersstill haunt me in my sleep.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the opening, the town of Sotoma is elegantly and painstakingly painted in its extravagant color, brightness, and its contrasting murderours darkness. The viewer is introduced to who we think would be our tale's main character and the love interest. But just as I was beginning to suspect I was stepping into just another cheesey lovestory, the artful series composers punched me in the face with one of Shiki's many dark surprises.\\n\\n\r\nI could not help but feel like one of the many helpless bitten townfolk; Shiki had managed to sink its vampiric teeth into my neck and I was hooked. I was drawn by the enchanting town by day, the dark terror by night, and the many carefully crafted personalities wandering the town. The odd background music compounded the mystery and terror haunting the air, drawing me further and further in.\\n\\n\r\nWithout giving away anything regarding the plot, I restrain myself to simply say that truly Shiki worked its magic on me, changing my initial opinions and views. \\n\\n\r\nTo merely say Shiki was well-done is an understatement; it is an utter masterpeice in the horror genre; something to leave one scared, questioning, and haunted long after the last episode.",

            "content": "Shiki was originally a horror novel written by Ono Fuyumi in 1998 and published in two parts. About nine years later it got a manga adaptation and this was followed by an anime adaptation in 2010. Why the long delay? Well, it probably wasn't originally intended to be anything except a novel. The important question is, should it have been adapted?\r\nThe story proper begins in a small Japanese village. A new family moves in to a really conspicuous European house. Soon people in the village start dying from loss of blood, but with no visible wounds except for two tiny puncture marks and no internalbleeding. Yeah, it's pretty obvious what's going on there. Honestly though, the fact that everything that's happening is really obvious is one of my few issues with the series. The story it tells brings up some interesting moral questions and Ono obviously did a lot of research into vampire lore in order to set the whole thing up. I like the way the characters respond to the events in a pretty realistic way instead of just jumping to the obvious conclusion, obvious to the viewer anyway.  But on the issue of it being far too obvious, it's pretty clear what's going on from the beginning and you know everyone who's going to die, because the first theme song shows all of the major characters who die dying. All I have to say about that is \"what the hell were they thinking?\" Why would you include spoilers like that in your opening theme? Did they just figure that every single viewer would have already read the novel and/or manga? Did they think that the viewers would be too stupid to notice? It really ruins the mystery element, and a lot of the suspense.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters mostly make up for the major flaw in the story. They're excellently developed and have a lot of depth. What they do is understandable given their circumstances and it makes the morality of the story really grey, which I like. Even the background characters are important to the story. The result is that the characters feel like real people, whether you agree with or even like a particular character or not, and that helps keep the narrative compelling. Even if it is really predictable.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is mostly really well done with nicely detailed characters and backgrounds. I do have a few issues, though. The first is that they draw the shiki so that they're obviously the antagonists with huge, empty eye sockets. Then they explain that they're supposed to look completely normal. Then what's the point of drawing them so that they look obviously different? Is it supposed to symbolise that they're dead? Is it supposed to help the viewer? Either way it doesn't make sense since the viewer knows or can figure it out, pretty quickly. It's just another touch that adds to the lack of any subtlety. They also draw some of their dogs so that they look more like pound puppy stuffed animals than actual dogs. Again, I ask why? It makes them look like they belong in a children's cartoon rather than in a horror story. And why is it only a few dogs? That just makes it obvious that they can draw dogs but choose not to for some of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very well done. The emotions conveyed sound very genuine and the voice actors actually employ subtlety very strongly in their performances. So at least there's one subtle element. The music is really well done and used to great effect. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. There is no yuri in this.\\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Shiki is an 8/10. I might have a few issues with the story and art, but it's still a really good anime with a great cast of characters. If you're interested in well done vampires or you just like a good story, I do recommend it. I would just suggest that you not pay any attention to the visuals during the theme because they will spoil quite a bit (I still have no idea why they set it up that way.)",

            "content": "Shiki is one of those anime that puts you in a difficult situation, requiring you to sympathize with a supernatural species that lives off the blood of humans. So, from the psychological term it's kind of similar to 'Tokyo Ghoul' and 'Parasyte' though the plot may be quite different.\r\nWhen science collide with the super natural things take a rather interesting turn. The logical way of thinking always concludes that there is is no such thing, yet circumstances says otherwise.\r\nWhen oil and water is forced to mix to together you end up with a liquid of unusual texture, one that seems both watery and oily. Thatis when you'll realize that they wont hold up together for long and one eventually needs to extracted. Such is the case here, when an unusual epidemic almost overshadowed the small village they eventually had to come face to face with the existence of shiki, meaning corpse demon.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7.2\\n\r\nThere's nothing particularly wrong with the story other than that it's a bit slow paced, which doesn't lead to any real twist. That little gap was covered up with violence and slaughter.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Now this one is a bit hard to describe....The background and the scenery was everything it should be, but the characters didn't go with it. However, it was unique in it's own way.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.7\\n\r\nThe sound track may not resonate with the environment but that itself was a plus for me as it increased the adrenaline. Moreover, I found it unique.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5.0\\n\r\nWith a few exception, the characters were poorly developed, like most of them has no real personality and are there solely for the purpose of being there. It left me the impression that the script writer was just being lazy.\\n\\n\r\nExperience: 8.0\\n\r\nBeing fond of the 'Horror' genre I was not at all disappointed with this series. Truth be told, for an anime that focused mainly on thriller it's one of the best. It went from calm to creepy in an instant with nothing in between and the illustration went perfectly with it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.1",

            "content": "The vampire genre is something that has gotten a bad rep over the years. Recently the \"Twilight\" franchise has succeeded in capitalizing off the romantic nature of the vampire while simultaneously bastardizing them in the mind of the public as bland, sappy, love figures for women to swoon over. Diversely, Anime has done very little to improve the overall reputation with titles like \"Hellsing\" and \"Vampire Hunter D\"  painting them as one-man army, gore fest, killing machines. Or going back towards the cheesy romance factor with \"Vampire Knight\" (And DON'T get me started on THAT one). It has been a long time since therehas actually been a vampire piece that fans can actually enjoy, something that (dare I say) they can sink their teeth into. Then along comes \"Shiki\". \\n\\n\r\nComing from the harem and slice of life factory that is Studio Daume, this show actually puts horror back into the bloodsucker genre. Delivering a story that feels like something out of a Stephen King novel where some spooky sh*t goes down in a small town. Vampires are more than just a plot device, they actually raise questions involving the creatures of the night and their right to live. They feed to survive. Should they really be hated for refusing to starve themselves to death? You be the judge. That's not to say this is a purely plot driven piece, there is PLENTY of bloody violence and gore to be had. And it also does touch on some romance notes (including one side character who makes Edward Cullen seem like Bruce Campbell in comparison). While also providing action scenes with a hammer and wooden stake being the weapons of choice. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and characters used in \"Shiki\" are a very interesting contrast. The characters themselves are drawn so vibrant, full of color, and with many distinct features (especially hair styles) that help to distinguish what is a large cast. And while the lot of them look like they're from a \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\" series on the outside, what lies within are deep characters with demons, desires, and back stories shrouded in mystery. Even without vampires in the picture, you still are curious about them. From the chain-smoking Dr. Ozaki, to the Junior Monk Muroi, and the mandatory super-serious, spiky haired, teenager Yuuki. Not to mention the numerous side-characters in the town who are too many to list in such a short review. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is very basic with forgettable opening and ending themes and a suitable soundtrack that sets up the right tones for what is going on during the show. The sound department did a good job with some cringe-worthy body noises that added that extra dimension to the horror on screen. (I thought only MY neck made that noise) The Sub vs. Dub battle goes decidedly to the Japanese cast, despite a strong showing from the English dubbers. Special mention goes to the latter for Tia Ballard's performance as Megumi as she fits the role so perfectly. I should also point out the equally splendid Japanese performance by Aoi Yuuki as Sunako.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a welcome title for anyone in the mood for a great blood-curdler, at 22 episodes long it is highly binge worthy with it's use of cliff-hanger endings and pace of plot. It adds legitimacy to the vampire as not only a tragic figure worthy of your sympathy, but also as beastly night stalkers who demand your fear. One of the best horror/suspense Anime I have ever seen and without a doubt the best vampire themed one, too. Overall 9/10. Check it out. Cheers!",

            "content": "\"Meh\". This is the best way for me to summarize my experience of watching Shiki. This review is spoiler free, and aimed at those wondering whether or not to watch this series.\r\nI found this show a constant frustration to watch, and I almost dropped it but decided not to after looking on the forums. Many suggested the second half of the show (and specifically the ending) were worth seeing the show out. Having completed it, I'm not sure this is the case.\r\nThe shows has a very frustrating sense of pacing for most of the series. There is enough development to keep you watching, but onlyjust. The ending is indeed quite good, but if you are expecting a great twist or something spectacular you may be disappointed. It ends well enough with some hearts wrenching moments, interesting moral questions and great action. But also leaves you with a feeling I can only describe as \"meh\".\\n\\n\r\nThis also applies to the tone of the show overall. Does it create a scary Horror vibe? Not really. it's kinda \"Meh\". Is it a great mystery? Not really. Kinda \"Meh\". Deep Philosophical questions? Kind of, but kind of \"Meh\". Action? \"Meh\". You can apply this to basically every element of the show. \\n\\n\r\nIt is not that it does anything badly, because it doesn't. It in fact does most things quite well. But it also fails to shine in any one area. I was hoping for it to be scary, but it wasn't. If it wasn't going to be scary, I was hoping the mystery would be intriguing with a great twist. But that never came either. It was quite predictable, a lot of violence, and then ends with a bang - but a foreseeable bang that left me wishing there was some great twist or reveal that would have made the agonizing pace worth it. Again, no delivery.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it? Well, if you like gore, a dark tone, interesting premise and a big action ending then it has all these. If you however were looking for a genuine shock, plot twists and a great 'mystery reveal' ending, you'll be disappointed. It does enough right to get a score of 6 (for technical reasons) but I don't really recommend watching this one. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6,  Art: 7,  Sound: 7,  Character: 7,  Enjoyment: 5,  Overall: 6\\n\\n",

The music for the anime is top-notch. Beautiful, sad, creepy.

            "content": "\"the jungle is dark, but there are diamonds there\" - Arthur miller, death of a salesman\r\nvampire films and TV shows have made a rather big comeback since the humble days of Dracula and the night flyer, but the comeback seems to have taken the horror genre out of the equation all together, with twilight dominating the vampire genre at the cinema and true blood, moonlight and blood ties (to name just a few) being the main proponents of television. these romantic and melodramatic takes on the vampire genre stray so far from the accepted view of vampires that it would leave any vampire fan witha bad taste in their mouth.\\n\r\nso as you can imagine I went into watching shiki expecting to see it suffer the same fate as the other vampire films which mock the genre all together (looking at the poster with Natsuno among the graves lead me to have these expectations as it seemed melodramatic and somewhat twilightesque) \\n\\n\r\nneedless to say my preconceptions where as hastily obliterated as they where conceived, for shiki does something that vampire films haven't done in decades: STUCK WITH TRADITION!\\n\r\nI say it stuck with tradition but that's mainly in terms of the vampires themselves, the actual setting has elements of modernism that are in conflict with the traditional ways of the older members of Satoba's community however I'll get to that later. let's do a run down of the show.\\n\\n\r\nstory: 10\\n\\n\r\nthe story starts out quite slow with the first few episodes establishing the characters and their views and opinions whilst presenting the mystery of the sudden deaths in the village. After this the show starts to gain momentum, which steadily increases until about the last 5 or 6 episodes at which point it's pace switches to full speed ahead. the first few episodes I must admit can be rather tedious as the pacing is very slow and doesn't progress much in that time, and those who don't have a lot of patience may decide to drop this anime because of this, however those who are patient will be greatly rewarded in later episodes where mystery, horror and madness come together to play with the audiences preconceptions and expectations like a rag doll. What I mean by that is that this particular anime has a very curious power to it in particular with the way it wields catharsis. The anime moulds its audience to its will by manipulating their emotions but at a certain point it will suddenly flip your original feelings on their head, so for example: they will show you a horrific travesty and the one responsible which will persist for several episodes but then it will switch from the victims point of view to the perpetrators and suddenly we find ourselves feeling sympathetic for the perpetrator.\\n\\n\r\nthere are several themes that are explored in shiki, some of which are quite unexpected, for example one theme which we would expect to see more in westerns than in horror is the theme of the old world making way for the new world. although this particular theme has been used in vampire films before such as interview with the vampire, in this case the way they explore this theme is somewhat confusing as, in shiki, it is the vampires who represent the new world and the villagers who represent the old world.\\n\r\nanother theme which is explored is prejudice which is explored mainly through Ozaki and Natsuno, who's prejudices against the vampires lead them to form a campaign against them. however, although the prejudice against the vampires is for the most part warranted, as we begin to explore the vampires psyche's we begin to realise that they still possess some element of humanity which in turns makes us pity them.\\n\\n\r\nand finally the main reason i think this story is great is its traditional view of vampires. in particular their traditional weaknesses are all there for example, they cannot go out into the sun or they will turn to ash, they can't enter a persons house without invitation etc. with all the romance films where they either sparkle in the sunlight or it just has no effect at all this is a refreshing reminder that vampires aren't cuddly creatures or wishy washy melodramatics. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nthe art is an acquired taste, and harkens back to the higarashi series. at times the characters movements can seem quite basic and minimalist however this reflects the atmosphere of the series as the series is patient in its execution of the story and the minimalist action creates an ethereal almost dreamlike atmosphere which since the vampires attack their victims while they sleep gives it that extra atmosphere. but where the art truly shines is in the characters expressions, particularly their expressions of madness and despair which the art style seems to exaggerate so there's no way the audience can't know what the characters are feeling at that particular moment.\\n\r\nthe characters hair is somewhat insane, and here it feels like the character designers became artistic as the hair of the characters come in every possible colour under the sun as well as every shape, from the neat school boy cut, to the downright absurd with hair appearing to defy gravity, it is here that i felt the art fell short as this seems to make the characters appear somewhat silly and somewhat ruins the atmosphere of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nthe sound was superb, and every piece of music fit every scene like a glove from the haunting and creepy child a'ccapella pieces erupting into a full on choral and orchestral epic, to the simple atmospheric pieces with harpsichords piano's and harps. all the music reflects the sorrow, anger, madness and pain that encompasses every episode. in particular i found that every piece of music that played while Seishin and Sunako where together and talking fully reflected the feeling of pity and remorse felt by both those characters. so in shiki's case the music isn't just to reflect the atmosphere but to intensify the emotions of the characters and mirror them to the audience so that the audience better understands the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nalthough one would expect to find a lot of Gregorian and \\n\r\nGothic choral pieces there where none to be found in shiki, in fact the majority of musical pieces where lullaby-esque and intensified the dreamlike atmosphere. one element which i found particularly new for a horror anime was the complete and utter lack of pathetic fallacy (weather reflecting the emotions of the characters) which is used quite extensively in most horror films particularly when the characters find themselves in a thunderstorm meant to represent their fear, shiki does not do this which sweperates it somewhat from the horror genre, but in that respect I would call it a thinking man's horror series.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nthis is where the show truly shines, each character is distinct and unique and many of them are characters that you rarely see, such as for example Ozaki Toshio, who reminds me so much of house that I wondered about his uniqueness for a long time, but if you watch the anime through you notice that he couldn't be more different.\\n\r\nthe characters are excellent with perhaps the exception of Natsuno who i felt was too melodramatic, however this does not hinder the show that much despite him being a main character, the characters truly create the show however the characters that steal the show are Ozaki, Seishin and Sunako who the shows creators use to play with the audiences ideas and feelings in particular with the audience's growing sympathy with sunako and Ozaki's clear descent into madness we find that the line between who the bad guys are and who the good guys are becomes so blurred that we can't truly say who we should be rooting for. the characters are part of the philosophy in particular they represent a statement about morality, that it is not set in stone and that no-one is all good or all bad.\\n\\n\r\nmany people will hate Megumi throughout the show but she is perhaps one of the best characters because of the power her emotions have on the audience as the audience remains consistently against her to the point where they feel she deserves whatever is coming to her. but it only takes one 10 minute segment in a later episode to make the audience feel incredibly guilty for feeling that. to understand what i mean you'll have to watch it through to the end yourself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nthis show will mess your emotions up in a good way, and through this it will open up avenues of thought that many of the audience may not have considered before but overall this show is very enjoyable and although it doesn't have the re-watch ability of other anime's it is still something worth seeing every few months. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is an excellent show and perhaps the best one i've seen since casshern sins came out. highly recommended \\n",

            "content": "WARNING: Contains minor spoilers\r\nCould you...forgive the killing of people? Are there cases when killing is absolutely necessary? Does killing to ensure your own survival come under self-defence? Can it be justified?\r\nIn other words, if you had to kill the people around you in order to live, would it be a crime?\r\nI have no doubt that right now, the answer is clear and obvious to all of you. It would be better to die than to kill an innocent person to live.\r\nLet me ask you another question. If vampires existed, and they killed the people around you in order to live, would it be a sin?No doubt it would. Then how can we justify our slaughter of farm animals to satisfy our own hunger? Isn't that too, a crime? Perhaps even more heinous, as we do not need meat in order to survive.\\n\\n\r\nSo why is it that killing of people by vampires is considered such an atrocity?\\n\r\nThis, my reader, is the world of Shiki. A world where vampires exist, people exist, and you are never sure who is wrong or right. It's been a long time since I've had to question the morality of both sides in an anime, and the feeling that was inspired in me after I finished this great series was simply amazement.\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nWestern Literature has seen a great up rise in vampire literature ever since the advent of Twilight. Gone are the vampires that used to haunt our nightmares; they are replaced by romanticized figures that often fall in love with mortals rather than hunt them. Some traditionalists, like myself, long for the days of Dracula, when vampires were who they are supposed to be.\\n\r\nSalem's Lot, Stephen King's amazing take on the original Dracula, was the first book that got me thoroughly interested in vampire literature; and since I haven't read the whole of Bram Stoker's novel, I'm going to have to compare Shiki with the occurrences in Salem's Lot, which may be my second favourite horror novel of all time, behind The Shining of course.\\n\r\nShiki takes place in a mostly isolated village, where the people are peaceful and easy going, maintaining their traditional lifestyle even as the world around them advances rapidly. The first episode introduces us to Shimizu Megumi, a pink haired girl who hates everything about the town, except for two things: Natsuno, the boy she has a crush on, and the large house that was built on Kanemasa hill. Throughout her life she dreamt of escaping the slow, sleepy village and making it to the city life, where she believes that she can actually enjoy herself. \\n\\n\r\nOne day, a family moves in to the Kanemasa house. Intrigued, Megumi decides to go visit the family and say her greetings. \\n\r\nWhen the villagers find her next, she's lying half dead in a forest, with no visible external injuries except for two insect bites. She becomes the first victim of the village, succumbing to an unknown illness.\\n\r\nNatsuno, who was the victim of Megumi's stalking, thinks of it as somewhat of a relief, since he finds himself free to open his curtains once again without the fear of being watched from the bushes. But even as this relief comes, he soon finds himself closing his curtains again, unable to sleep at night as he feels as though something outside is watching him, watching his every move...\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, the waka-sensei (young doctor) Ozaki is trying to figure out the truth behind the sudden epidemic that seems to be causing deaths all over the village. People die and the people around them disappear, moving out with no warning at all. His frustration builds up as he discovers that all suffer from anemia and its various symptoms, but he fails to piece it all together. One idea, one clue is all he needs to figure out the cause behind all the mysterious deaths..\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of Shiki is somewhat slow moving and works to build on the atmosphere of the situations and the characters themselves, making this similar to Monster in its own way. We follow Dr. Ozaki as he works furiously to determine the cause of the deaths, and Natsuno, as he discovers the truth in his own way and attempts to confront it. Both characters develop, but more attention is given to Ozaki as his frustration increases and he begins to lash out at his close associates, suffering under the pressure he has as the village's doctor. Meanwhile Natsuno joins hands with the few people who believe him and attempt to prove the existence of Shiki (corpse-demons), called the Risen in the village folk-lore.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, once we reach the second half, the slow pace is removed and things start moving faster. The tension builds up rapidly, before the climax, and the gore-fest that follows it. All immensely satisfying.\\n\r\nOne thing I absolutely love about Shiki, apart from how atmospheric and tense it is, is the fact that it follows traditional vampire folklore, while placed in an Eastern environment. This means that Shiki can't walk in broad daylight, they are weak around religious objects, and of course, they can't enter a house unless they are invited inside.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis show has quite a large number of characters, but unlike Angel Beats!, they all are realistic, interesting, and fairly well developed to the point that you can understand why they do what they do.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, my favourite character throughout the show is Ozaki himself, who is now one of my favourite anime heroes of all time. I say heroes subjectively, however. While he appears heroic to me, to many others he is seen as a villain. His morality, in the second half, is constantly in question, and you can see the characters choosing sides based on his actions. Ozaki isn't your classic perfect-white character; neither is he the dark gray that Light Yagami was. He's directly in the middle, with the shades of black equal to the shades of white, making him the most intriguing protagonist that I've seen in a while. In fact, the last time I thought so much about the main character was probably Code Geass.\\n\\n\r\nI could sense some sort of darkness lurking behind his sarcastic attitude and him impatience, and as it built up before that episode, I was literally quivering in anticipation. Then it happened, and, for the first time since third episode of Higurashi, I got goosebumps on my arm. That scene was terrible in its own way. It will shock you to your core, and ultimately it is your view on it that will decide which side you prefer in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Natsuno, who has relatively less importance, is given less development. At the beginning, he is an arrogant individual who refuses to even recognize Megumi even as she tries to talk to him, which probably gave him the whole stalking problem in the first place. In fact, the only thing that he even accepts about her is her wish to leave the town, which he reciprocates. However, as time goes on, he realizes the importance of the people around him and their support in his struggle against the Shikis. \\n\r\nThen there's the junior monk, Seishin. He is Ozaki's closest friend, yet their positions couldn't be more different. While Ozaki uses modern age medicine to cure people of illnesses, Seishin uses ritualistic traditions to give them proper send offs. Similarly, he is among the first to discover the existence of the Shiki; but rather than attack them and kill them all, he decides to try to understand them and their motives, which seem to be somehow resonate with the motives of a character in the book he is writing.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, even the Shiki are given development, enough for the watcher to understand and pity them as they are dragged to their inevitable deaths. A perfect example of this is Megumi, whose stalker syndrome becomes a full blown obsession after she rises, and she begins to attack those who she believes to be too close to Natsuno. Her death, in a way, was the most heartfelt of all the Shiki because she still displays her recognizable human traits until the very end, which invokes a sense of sorrow in the people who are hunting her down. \\n\\n\r\nOthers include Masao, the despicable self-obsessed person who turns into a Shiki displaying those same characteristics with that same annoying face; Tatsumi, who is one of the few vampires who can walk around in sunlight; Nao, whose undying love for her family caused her to attack them in the hope of allowing them to live an everlasting life as she does now; Sunako, and Chizuru.\\n\\n\r\nSunako, in her own way, is the Dracula of the series. She is the brains behind the operation, and fills the classic horror-anime role of the young girl who knows way too much at such a young age. If you know what I mean. Like Maria Ushiromiya from Umineko. She too, is given development, but anything beyond what I just said will be spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nChizuru, on the other hand, uses her looks to seduce unsuspecting men, and is always on the lookout for an interesting man who can entertain her. Hmmph.\\n\\n\r\nAn interesting idea that they added into the story is that the Shiki retain their consciousness and their pre-mortem (?) behaviour. This really adds to the emotional quotient of the show, besides letting Shiki appear neither truly good or bad, and also adding much more punch to the aforementioned scene.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and Sound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't resist mentioning this in the review, because I absolutely love the music. It stands out among the various traditional instrumentals that we hear in most anime; the soundtrack of Shiki really shines since ethereal vocals power the background music. It really gets you on edge and adds to the tension of the situation. My favourite song in the whole soundtrack is definitely Eau de Vie (Water of Life in French)  and Silent Night, beautiful tracks that will probably haunt me for the rest of my life.\\n\\n\r\nLike most anime, you see that the opening song changes around episode 13. The original opening, Kuchikuzuke was strange, depressing, and haunting just like the anime itself; but I could never really warm up to it. On the other hand, the ending seemed out of place but catchy. In the second half, the roles were reversed and I found the opening catchy, but out of place, and the ending more haunting.\\n\\n\r\nNo doubt most of the voice actors are either very good or competent; however, I had problems listening to Masao's voice, whose voice actor kept stressing on all the 'k's and making them sound like 'kh's. It might match his personality, but at times it went overboard and I got irritated just listening to it.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, the animation is fairly fluid, but nothing really stands out, even in HD. It plays its part, which is good enough, but don't expect jaw dropping scenes from this anime. Just expect a whole lot of red in the last few episodes.\\n\r\nAn important thing to mention is that this anime is extremely graphic. Not just blood all over place, even Higurashi has that (except with lolis). This anime has nearly no violence until the middle, when everything becomes clear to our main characters, and the sudden violence hits you hard just like it should, rather than the feeling that 'oh, people are going to die' that you get from Higurashi. When people die, they actually die. The show makes this brutally clear. Besides that, this is the first anime I've seen that shows decomposing bodies. No, literally decomposing. The first time I saw one, I got my first jumpscare since Higurashi. I've never seen any other anime do that, perhaps because its far too explicit. \\n\\n\r\nNext about character designs....yeah about that. Most characters look alright, I mean Ozaki looks kinda weird at times, Natsuno has a strange hairstyle, Masao looks like an idiot, yeah we can live with those. My major gripe comes when the Shiki are involved. When we first see them, they look like complete idiots. No literally, they look retarded. Like they were pulled out of Disneyland. I mean, take a look at their hairstyles. Who even wears that kind of stuff? Shouldn't the villagers be wary of a strange man with strange white hair in a strange hair style? Yet it seems to bother them none.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that, the hair colour of the main characters can be questionable, mostly involving Ricchan (who has green hair and another strange hair pattern), Natsuno (purple) and Megumi (neon pink). We see these hair colours in most anime but it seems kind of strange, considering how dark this anime really is. Some may consider it to show that it's a normal village in an abnormal situation, but it takes away from the shock factor in some situations, just looking at that glowing pink hair.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is presented in the normal suspense-thriller fashion, with the search for the culprit occupying the first half, and the resolution and subsequent, rampage to kill the culprits occupying the second half. However, this show takes care to tell you both sides of the story. As the humans lose control and kill all they view as suspicious, we see Shiki who fail to understand their sins, their only wish being to stay alive. They have no idea why they are being punished for living. At the same time, you see a mother's pain as her Shiki father-in-law slowly kills off her family, and her losing her grip on her sanity as her husband, mother in law, and her children is taken. It's hard hitting and true; you can easily imagine these reactions if such a thing were to occur in real life.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhen I went into this show, I wasn't expecting something so deep and philosophical as Shiki is. The last vampire show I watched was Hellsing X Ultimate, which is basically the polar opposite of Shiki. It requires no brains at all; it simply involves an incredibly strong protagonist causing a sea of blood in his wake. Shiki, on the other hand, humanizes the Shiki and their fear of being ostracized and forsaken by God; while at the same time exposing the monster that lurks inside the mind of humans. We don't have the classic 'you shouldn't kill for revenge' that we see so often; Ozaki urges the people on by reminding them of their lost loved ones and telling them to massacre the Shiki in revenge. Shiki is a show that goes far from the classic formulaic anime; and it does it with such confidence and poise that you can't help but love it. When I started out, I wanted to watch Shiki as a possible anime adaptation of Salem's Lot, and while it has its similarities; by the end I am forced to accept Shiki's brilliance and accept it as not just an adaptation, but perhaps one of the most compelling versions of the classic Dracula story till date. It's not just mindless killing. It's a vampire show that requires you to question your own moralities, make your own decisions, and for me, it is the best suspense anime that I've ever seen. No, it's not fair to call it a vampire tale; it's a tale of Shiki.",

            "content": "I ended up watching Shiki when I went on a Vampire binge one week. And don't worry, that's not a big spoiler or anything, it's actually fairly obvious to the point that it is impossible to miss before it is blatantly stated. I binged this series in give or take two days with barely any breaks to speak of. That's how invested I became in this series. The full 24 episodes, that includes the two specials which are very important, run half an hour each and the story continues to unfold with each new episode. So lets break this down like a normal review.\r\nAs faras the story is concerned, it's phenomenal. Sure, it starts off slow for the first 5 episodes, but that's because those are the introductory episodes. They introduce you to the many characters that populate the isolated village of Sotobamura, introduce the village itself as a character of sorts, and then introduce the main plot to you. After the 5th episode, the story kicks into high gear and never lets you get off until its over. By the end of it, the story will have you asking yourself a simple question: Who are the real monsters?\\n\\n\r\nThe art is also extremely appropriate for this horror/mystery series. The art is dark and dreary, but colorful when it needs to be. The characters are drawn with anime hair syndrome, but it does add character to them, makes them stand out from one another. On the other hand, the characters are all like sticks. Tall, lean, anorexic to a point, and every female character(Well, almost everyone) has fairly large breasts. The gore level is also to not be taken lightly. While it will be fairly rare to see guts or anything, decomposing flesh is a constant, and the dissolving flesh of vampires that get caught in daylight is particularly gruesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is quite fitting, with most tracks featuring gregorian chants as well as an organ. The music tells of death, sadness, loneliness, hopelessness, and heartbreak. All wrapped up in a neat bundle. I can't tell you how many times I've put the soundtrack on repeat, just listening to it as inspiration for my own stories. To go along with the art, story, and music, the sound effects are also quite fitting. Most of it is constant ambient sounds that are common from one end of the village to the other. Then their are the more common sounds that are standard fair for an anime series such as footsteps, crunching grass, cars, etc.\\n\\n\r\nGoing in with sound, there is the English Dub. Funimation managed to obtain the rights to Shiki, and I am very grateful for that. Funimation put their dub pedigree to very good use with this series. No character seems wrongfully cast and each character displays the necessary range of emotions at the proper times. There weren't really any cases of generally bad acting so I really don't see anything wrong at all with this dub. I strongly recommend that if you're not fond of reading, the dub is definitely worthy of a look.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are abundant in this series, and quite frankly, it helps a lot. A majority of the characters present in the series are background characters. And as background characters in a horror story, many of them are picked off one by one as the story progresses. But we're not talking a handful of characters. Oh no, we're talking about an entire village worth of background characters. Some of them return later in the series, but most are never seen again. So unless it's a main character, I'd recommend not getting particularly attached to any one character, otherwise you will most likely suffer heartbreak.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found this series to be a masterpiece, worthy of multiple viewings. I found next to nothing wrong with it, and so can highly recommend this series to anyone who is interested in it. Just give it 5 to 6 episodes and you should be hooked. It needs time to rev its engine, but once it starts moving, for the love of god fasten your seat belt.",

            "content": "I'm going to start off by saying after reflecting, Shiki was my favourite show of 2010, and i watched an entire 3 shows! \r\nShiki does an awful lot of things extremely well, but you might be surprised as to which aspects it excels. This is not an action packed show, and nor is it a frightening show, although certainly graphic at times. I'd define this show more as a study of how people react to a highly unusual situation that is pushed upon them. \r\nThe story is a relatively simple one, in an isolated rural town, the Kirishiki family have built and then move intoa large Western style mansion, and immediately after people begin to die under mysterious circumstances. The story is both classic in content and simple in execution. I'd also like to give a nod for the length of the series, whatever the reason for cutting off 4 episodes, the pacing of the show was much improved as a result, the mid part of the show could have dragged down the pacing if extended and i much appreciated the non stop pacing of the final third of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were fantastic, the colours are memorising at times, the character models were original and well drawn, i believe allot of people came to dislike the strange way in which the eyes were drawn, but it gives off a great sense of 'otherness' in a highly unusual way, and it added to further the uniqueness of the visuals. The voice acting was fantastic throughout, the music ranged between eerie and atmospheric and i genuinely can't stop playing the second opening. If nothing else about this show you will distinguish it from other shows by the visuals and they should stay with you for some time to come.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has a simply huge cast and i feel it's unnecessary to go into specifics, it spreads screen time amongst them all, the range of characters works fantastically as they are steadily divided into two opposing factions in the those rising as Shiki and the surviving town people. Shiki gives you an awful lot to ponder in terms of character motivations and the grey area between right and wrong, i was certainly unsure of were i was sympathising by the end. \\n\\n\r\nI was intrigued by this show from the first episode, and this lingered some way into the early episodes, the show falls into a recurring pattern as the story progresses, but when the events come to a head during the second half of the show it's nothing short of engrossing, and highly thought provoking. This show takes a very simple premise and turns it into something extremely special and i recommend anyone looking for something a little bit different gives it a try.",

I also haven't watched this in a few months, but I have been suggesting it to a lot of people, so I thought I would write up something. \r\nShiki's story is one you may have heard before - a small, rural village where strange happenings and murders start to occur and this is true, but the more you get into the show, the better it gets. I think a lot of people do not give Shiki a shot because they think it will be too generic and possibly becauseof the art and I also felt the same way, but I was very pleased that I gave Shiki a shot. \\n\\n\r\nIt starts off rather simply, with a small rural village with a tiny population lives their daily normal lives, but things are about to be disrupted by the new, mysterious family that has built a giant mansion in their small village and plans to move there. This is when things start to go downhill in the town, as people start dying off one by one and coming back to life late at night, only to stalk and kill some of their own family members and friends. However, these 'creatures' aren't lifeless, mindless beings, but have their own goals, that aren't always what you would expect them to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is semi episodic, in that each episode is named after the number of people that have died in the show (8th night, 9th coffin), but the story focuses around the doctor of the town who is slowly being driven off the edge because he can't save anyone who comes into his care. As more and more people die, the more disturbing the show gets. \\n\\n\r\nAt the later parts of the show, I was genuinely surprised at how good the show got and makes you wonder who are the monsters? The monsters or the humans?",

            "content": "Shiki was a refreshing breath of fresh air from an overused trope in anime. Unlike zombie apocalypses, vampires is one theme that pops up everywhere, from anime, to fiction, to really bad romances, they're everywhere. Shiki takes advantage of the popularity of vampires to give us a chilling tale of struggle and regret, using vampires much closer to their original forms. The best part about this series is the characters, as I felt that none of them were really undeveloped by the end, which is impressive considering the massive cast of this show. I'll start by telling a bit about the story. There are threepoints of view of this story. The first is the point of view of Dr. Ozaki, the first human to discover these vampires, who takes a very anti-vampire approach. There is also the view of the vampires, which was an interesting take on the story. It attempted to make vampires relatable, which it succeeded with flying colors. It showed the strife of people who became vampires from being fed on, thrown into a situation where they have to give up their humanity to survive and prey on their previous friends. The third point of view is that of Natsuno Yuuki, the outsider. He never changes his view on the problem, no matter what happens, and is often the only rational person out of any of the characters.\\n\r\nThe art style of Shiki was very stylistic, and was able to capture the situation very well. The vampires were also well portrayed and the few action scenes this anime has were beautifully done. The eyes also looked amazing.\\n\r\nOST-wise this anime was okay. It had one very chilling track (Shi-Ki) that really captured the feel of the anime, but other than that the tracks were okay. The first opening wasn't the best, but I really enjoyed listening to the second one.\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, I think I may have explained a lot in the story, but it's worth mentioning that the supporting cast of humans/vampires is what makes the story. Everyone has a struggle, whether it's giving up their humanity to save their lives as vampires or losing their friends to the growing menace. \\n\r\nOverall Shiki was an excellent anime that words cannot describe. Still one of my favorites to this day, Shiki deserves just a bit more attention.",

If you don't like Gore, there is no joking here and you should look for a different title\r\nThe story:\r\n It's too well written. \r\nUnlike other horror series, movies and games that cook horror by adding two principles (fear of unknown + ton of gore content) to get a beautifully made horroras they think. and because of this recipe, People show different responses to the horror genre in general. Some people get scared, others laugh and others see its boring.\\n\r\nThis series is different. It starts slow but get crazy later on. \\n\r\nwhy couldn't the writer just do as mentioned above? Why did he put a lot of meaning, hard work, twists, emotions, and thought-provoking dialogues? \\n\r\nby doing what he did, it gave us a good story which you can't react to as any other horror series out there, can't rest till you reach the end and can't stop thinking of it after you finish.\\n\\n\r\n\"SPOILERS AHEAD...SPOILERS AHEAD\"\\n\r\nIF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED IT YET JUST SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH AND GO TO THE NEXT SECTION\\n\r\nI disagree about two points in this story : \\n\r\n(you may agree with or against me it's a though-provoking series after all)\\n\r\n------1)The idea of co-existence with other kinds....\\n\r\nthis story follow the General Japanese anime concept\\n\r\nthe story is of two groups lets say A and B \\n\r\nwhen A tries to kill B, it isn't A's fault\\n\r\nbut when B fights A back, B is a monster ?\\n\r\nEnough Japan stop spreading this idea. all over your works\\n\r\n(I think people  who watched the show got my point)\\n\r\n--------2)Forsaken by God..God is always silent..etc\\n\r\nGod has his own time and plans and I won't get much into this.\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWell, this was drawn beautifully. The pupils and how they change through series events are enough to get this one a high score.\\n\r\n---------------------------------\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI got into anime in general by anime music pieces I listened on youtube.\\n\r\nOne of these anime which had a great soundtrack was Shiki. I even listened to the whole soundtrack many times for a long time before I watched it.\\n\r\nMade by Takanashi, Yasuharu the same guy that made Naruto Shippuden, borto and hell girl that was a masterpiece only the 1st op, end songs were terrible. \\n\r\n--------------------------------\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nHere is where the writer Nailed it. there are many varieties ones disgusted me (Tatsumi comes to my mind, also migami), others felt sorry for and many many feelings (enough spoilers for now.) The writer as I mentioned above didn't write a shallow horror story but with those characters, he filled that usual hole in horror series, you can feel every grain of emoition in this series is well done. some episodes that was with much emotions that comes to my mind the 2 extra episodes 20.5 and 21.5 make sure to watch them especially 21.5 important to the story.\\n\r\n---------------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment: as I mentioned before. It starts slowly and boring but gets crazy later on.unlike any other anime I watched this one, 2 episodes at a time and the last time 8 episodes straight. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before \"..This one.. you can't react to as any other horror series out there, can't rest till you reach the end and can't stop thinking of it after you finish..\"\\n\\n\r\nHope this was helpful.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Shiki is a difficult anime to watch for me not because of the killing spree but mainly because it poses the never-ending question, \"what is the boundary between good and evil? of life and death?\"\r\nShiki, also known as corpse demon is a story about a whole village turned into vampires. Strange things starts to happen in a small village of Sotoba when the Kirishiki family arrived. People slowly dying from one disease to another until the numbers became alarming that Dr. Ozaki Toshio starts to investigate the cause of the seemingly epidemic that slowly eating the villagers away. And he was about to get theshock of his life when he got to the bottom of it.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, I almost dropped this after the first half. Why? Because I was having a terrible headache watching things unfold. It was painfully frustrating for me. When it was still a mystery, I was really excited as to how things would turn out but when it did, I was like, \"So, that was it. Then what?\" Don't get me wrong. I think the series managed to deliver what it was supposed to deliver. No romanticizing, no sugarcoating whatsoever of what shiki is. They are bloodsuckers. They feed on humans to survive as humans feed on chicken, cows, etc. However, since shiki's are previously human it was a little bit hard to decide what course to take.\\n\\n\r\nI must say that Dr. Ozaki Toshio and Muroi Seishin are two pivotal characters since their course of action has lead things to conclusion. While Dr. Ozaki has been decided since the beginning, Muroi was taking his sweet time deciding and I wasn't surprised when he choose what he choose. Because he was like the man in the novel he was writing, trapped and wanted to be free.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character has to be Natsuno. Let's just say, for most of the part I agree with him and probably would do the same thing if I were him. I almost feel bad for Tohru but changed my mind, anyway. I don't sympathize with the shiki's as I don't with humans. It isn't a question of who's the monster and who's not. Who's good and evil. Because we are both. Regardless of who and what you are, you are both good and evil. It just a matter of deciding what to do with it.\\n\\n\r\nWho wouldn't be afraid of dying? Something unknown and vague as death is dreadful. That's why we try to live while we're alive. Because we'll never know when death would claim us. Regrets? Lingering feelings? We all have that. But death is absolute. Once you die, your time is up. Game's over, my friend.\\n\\n\r\nShiki is shiki. Human is human. Shiki hunts human to survive. And humans fight for their lives. Both have reasons to fight. If coexisting is impossible, then one must fall. Sure, I understand where the shiki is coming from but it doesn't mean human would just stand there and do nothing. We decide and fight for what we think is right for us.\\n\\n\r\nBut surely we are imperpect. Always confusing things. Fighting our own demons. We hurt people. We hurt ourselves. We make half-hearted decisions. That's human for you.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I still don't have clear view on shiki. And I still have headache. But it was something worth watching so you should probably give it a try, too.",

            "content": "Dracula, Twilight: We all know what the vampire genre consists of. Blood sucking monsters that turn into bats. Shiki, however, is a little bit different. Yes, people suck blood, but it\u2019s more than that.\r\nToday, a review of the critically acclaimed anime, Shiki, another entry into the vampire genre. \r\n-Story & Characters-\r\nTaking place in the fictional village of Sotoba, our story features two protagonists: Natsuno Yuuki, a high school student who hates living in the sticks, and Toshio Ozaki, the local doctor. A mysterious string of deaths have been occurring, and each victim has one thing in common: A bit wound on a part of theirbody. These bite marks are caused by the Shiki, or vampires.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most brilliant things that Shiki does is its unique take on the vampire genre. When someone dies, there is a chance that he or she will come back to life as a Shiki, who are immortal, and can only die by a stake to the heart, decapitation, or prolonged exposure to sunlight. When someone becomes a Shiki, however, they actually have to learn how to live and adapt to the Shiki lifestyle. Shiki cannot go a certain period of time without sucking blood, or else they will die: However, the Shiki, while dead humans, are still human. They have emotions, they can be happy, sad, or angry, and are always reluctant at first to hunt humans for nourishment. It\u2019s things like this that make us sympathize with the Shiki, and how they aren\u2019t monsters at all. They didn\u2019t choose to come back to life, they didn\u2019t choose to have to hunt humans in order to survive, it\u2019s simply a cruel twist of fate. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself, for the most part, had a good pace, aside from the halfway point, where it felt slow. It was this rough patch in the middle of the show that actually made me want to drop it because of how uninteresting it was. Luckily, though, it picked itself back up, and didn\u2019t let up. The atmosphere is always eerie and unsettling, and it sometimes borders on the scary side of things, and while there weren\u2019t any plot twists, it didn\u2019t need any because of how well told it was. The closing episodes also featured some of the saddest moments that I have ever seen in any anime, and the final episode in particular had me teary eyed.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, on the other hand, are a mixed bag. A good bunch of them are likeable and interesting, such as Kaori and Akira, and some of the Shiki, such as Sunako and Megumi. A lot of them, unfortunately, are on the underdeveloped side, with some of them being either bland or annoying. Toshio was another interesting character, as he started off as a compassionate doctor and ended up going through a massive transformation.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story suffers from a really big downfall in the middle and has some weak characters, it\u2019s very dark, gritty, and, most importantly, engaging.\\n\\n\r\n-Visuals & Sound-\\n\r\nThe visuals are rather hard to describe. The backgrounds look great and the Shiki look unsettling, but it\u2019s the designs of the characters that I simply cannot look over. The tone of the show is very dark, yet most of these characters look like they\u2019re part of a circus troupe. Freakishly long, zig-zag hair, a full-on beard that looks like a boat anchor, huge fishy lips, and the list goes on. It was really hard for me to take some scenes seriously when the characters look that outrageous. \\n\\n\r\nThe dub is very solid. I haven\u2019t heard of most of these voice actors with the exception of maybe one or two, but I\u2019d like to see them in more shows, because they really nailed their performances, and perfectly matched the personalities of the characters. There was no overacting, and every actor delivered their lines nicely.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the audio, it would be a crime if I didn\u2019t mention the absolutely gorgeous musical score. Considering how dark the show is, this composer managed to make it even darker and more effective with its melancholic tone and haunting vocals and chimes. I consider this to be one of my top five favorite soundtracks of all time because it was so effective and managed to give me emotion to scenes that didn\u2019t even have any. While I felt that some of the songs were overplayed at times, I didn\u2019t mind it, because of how beautiful the tracks were. Buy this soundtrack at full price if you have to, it\u2019s a must-own. \\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion-\\n\r\nShiki was an anime that really caught me off guard. It got universal critical acclaim, and while I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s quite as good as people say, it\u2019s still a high tier anime that deserves to be on everybody\u2019s shelves. With a captivating story and gorgeous soundtrack, it\u2019s hard not to recommend Shiki to anybody who loves this genre.\\n\\n\r\nGive this one a shot: You\u2019ll love it.\\n\\n\r\n+Compelling story\\n\r\n+Eerie atmosphere\\n\r\n+Visually pleasing\\n\r\n+Solid dub\\n\r\n+Phenomenal soundtrack\\n\r\n-Laughable character designs\\n\r\n-Opening episodes of the second half was completely uninteresting\\n\r\n-Some characters are likeable, others aren\u2019t\\n\\n\r\nFinal score:\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm not a fan of vampire stories, at all, I never have been. Vampire genre always reminds me of some cheap books and movies (such as Twilight). I don't like Kuroshitsuji nor Vampire Knight. \r\nAnd well, this anime got me, it is quite a series. With wonderful pacing and great vibe. This anime would have gotten a better score from me, if not for various small things that I didn't like at all.\r\nI'm still surprised that I enjoyed vampire series.\r\nSCORES\r\nSTORYLINE: \r\nHere we find ourselves in a small village of Sotoba, there's only 1300 residents in the area. It's a small, separated village, barely anybody noticesit. \\n\r\nFor some reason outsiders move in to the village, they live in a castle of sorts. \\n\r\nFrom the time when they moved in, mysterious deaths occur. Young Doctor Ozaki (which is one of the main characters) tries to investigate the matter, thinking that an epidemic has began in the village.\\n\r\nThen he realizes that the reason for these deaths might be something more supernatural, and that's when the story begins to snowball. We get to know about the vampires and their thoughts about what they are doing.\\n\r\nThat they are really doing anything wrong, they just eat.\\n\r\nBut they eat people.\\n\\n\r\nVIBE: \\n\r\nThe authors build a really creepy and unsettling vibe. For the first like 10 episodes you get to investigate yourself, what is exactly going on. Nothing is really explained and yet so much is showed. That's the mystery part.\\n\r\nI love this anime for its depth. Not only it provides existential thought, but also shows the unfinished conflict between what's wrong and what's right. For me it was a really emotional experience that made me think about life, death and the omnipotence of our world.\\n\r\nThose are really in-depth thoughts and I enjoy every series that makes me think about that.\\n\r\nMoreover we have two characters that, although being friends, have the exact opposite way of thinking, at times it was frustrating and badly executed, but mostly its a good motive and I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nART STYLE:\\n\r\nIt is certainly an art style that fits thriller/horror genre. It is dark, it has scary faces, weird animations and such.\\n\r\nAlthough some characters look a bit weird, like Natsuno or Seishin, I like it. Especially the backgrounds were they are, so-called background porn. \\n\r\nI also like how they drawn the main vampires, they look scary and mysterious with their black-out eyes.\\n\r\nAt least its original, I haven't seen an anime that drew characters such as this one.\\n\r\nMUSIC/VOICEACTING:\\n\r\nLet's start with music here. Opening and ending was pretty average, I certainly won't be listening to that outside the anime. But the soundtrack is pretty awesome. Especially the part with the girl singing \"Laaalaaalaaaa\". It's quite creepy and when it appeared I always got some goose bumps.\\n\r\nMostly the soundtrack is quite creepy, which is good it matches the genre. And then you can find some really good sad pieces of music, with piano and bells, really nice.\\n\r\nAbout the voice acting. I'm always watching anime in Japanese, so I'm talking about the Japanese version. I only manages to recognize one voice, which is great, I love when it happens. It only means that the authors made the effort to look for other people, than use those popular ones.\\n\r\nIt was great, especially with the main vampires, they have wonderful voices, and they act amazingly, that's how I would see vampires talking.\\n\r\nBut overall it was amazing, people cried, people shouted, people whispered, people were scared. It was a pleasure to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\r\nIn the conclusion I'm just gonna say that it's a really good anime. One of the best mysteries I've seen so far. There's gore, there's creeps and great plot. It's a good combination of pacing and action, very nice job. Hopefully this series can reach more people, and more people will understand it. Even those who don't really like vampire genre, such as myself!  \\n\\n\r\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/McMY2FGc_bM\\n",

            "content": "(What I've written here spoils some of the themes for this story, so I suggest you watch the anime for yourself before reading this. Furthermore, I tend to use the word \"story\" over \"anime\" or \"manga\" because I'd like to not be criticized by manga/anime fans who argue over \"that\". So I just call it \"story\".)\r\nStory - 10\r\nIt seems to be developed by the characters and not the plot itself. The characters' development throughout the story contribute to the plot. This story is all about the plot, which sounds weird but it's true. In this story, EVERYONE deserves to die, either for the blood thatthey have spilled or for standing idly by and letting the bloodletting continue. But, is that such the case? As is questioned in the end of the story.\\n\\n\r\nI like how the author incorporates religion into the story. What is sin? Does it exist? Is it so horrible to commit a heinous crime such as the taking of a person's life? Is it murder if there was no intent? These questions are as to why I choose not to believe. But some people do because of their belief in the existence of God. Additionally, does it apply to human-like creatures?\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nBoth English voice actors and Japanese seiy\u016b fit the settings, timings, and reactions of the characters really well, instead of like in SAO where the English voice actors lack all emotion and motivation which irritates me to hell. Also, the music really fits the overall story, if you've listened to the track \"Shi-ki\". The music is the best that I've known, though it doesn't always fit certain settings in the story, unlike Clannad. But most of the time, it really sends a chill down your spine sometimes, which I think is exciting (not in a happy way). It will either make you want to turn away and not look or look at what will happen next.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nReality. It's a strange yet sound description of the world we live in. A virus that can destroy our immune system, a single corrupt cell that can kill one whole human, weapons of mass destruction. Humans once believed none of this to be possible and were fantasies. Now that they are real, we accept all possibilities and delve into them with what we call fringe science. The American Sci-fi TV series Fringe greatly plays on the facts of such possibilities. All the characters seemed \"real\". Masao is one hell of an annoying baka, but there are people like him in real life. He's the first type of character I've \"seen\" out of all the characters I've known. His appearance in the story drastically changed my perception of it, as I thought that this would be a typical horror story when I began watching. I can relate to Natsuno as he is logical, but harbors strong feelings as well. When in fear, you will either always stay in fear or change it into hate. Kaori was always scared to take action, but eventually snapped. People have their limits, and this is ALWAYS shown in Shi-ki. ALL of the characters are realistic.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe art doesn't really throw me off but sometimes the realism of it is bent so as to fit the \"supernatural\"ness of the story. Probably reading too much into it now, but almost all of the art is representative, down to the opening animations of the anime. Don't pay attention to how weird the it is, and if you're one of those people who would rate this anime lowly JUST BECAUSE of that, THEN GROW UP. I'm serious, I once thought the anime was too weird and stupid just because of that, along with the blood involved. Just accept it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nAs for \"enjoying\" this story, I can hardly explain it in such words. This moreover opened my foolish, childish mind; it was enlightening. Shi-ki is, what I consider, a polar opposite of Clannad. Shi-ki portrays the dark side of humanity; the inhumanity against humanity and the similarity between humans and beasts. Clannad however portrays the goodwill of mankind amongst itself; a town that nurtures its children and keeps it safe and parents shaping their dreams into their children's dreams. If you want to watch such touching stories, Shi-ki is a must. Clannad, Shi-ki, Air, Kanon, Death Note, Little Busters, and Psycho-Pass are the most emotionally touching stories I know. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\nThis is my perspective of the story, so shut up and accept it. If you're a shounen manga/anime type, don't try and watch this. If you're one of those who can handle this, then by all means see for yourself. I find this to be one of the few anime I could really re-watch, and once-in-a-while things are rare finds for me, like boba. When I read a story, I try to take in the author's perception of what he is writing. Sometimes a portion of what he writes is an accident and it came out pretty well so he stuck with it, as shown in the OVAs of the anime. They were unnecessary parts to his story, but I think he just thought \"Why the hell not?\" and put it as a part of the story. They best portrayed his other points about rationality and emotions. In summary, the author points out every contrasting point about humanity to what I think is the best of his ability.",

            "content": "Story:10- Reason, because it had a well drawn out plot. It did not rush the story (much to my personal frustration, which is a good thing honestly) and it developed its characters and relations well.\r\nArt: 10- It had well balanced artwork, between the day and the night. The people in themselves shine. The eyes are detailed and the horror scenes are beyond detailed. They show every inch of things, and it will make skin crawl.\r\nSound-10: it becomes its own. The sound track is amazing. It mixes the emotions just right and gives depth to characters and plot. The sounds within the series is both horrifyingand outstanding. The way the deaths sounded made one truly sick but then it was entertaining at the realism in it.The music also leaves you with a haunting tone and it continuously repeats in your head. Each scene has it's own unique style and sound for it and it portrays the sadness and sacrifices made within the series. It will also scare most if not prepared.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-9: All together well developed over the length of the series. The main characters did not need full backgrounds since most were described in flashbacks as the series continued. Their personalities shined as well- and each character was different and had a different view of the situations within the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10- This series made me think and see how life is from another perspective. The vampire's side, which they are brought back (somehow-we don't know exactly how or why) and in order to survive they must kill and feed. Now some may find that justifiable, others may not, but the truth is, neither side could win.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10: It is a series that full embraces the horror genre, and mixes together a good plot, enough mystery and suspense until the end where things are relatively solved and in a sense there is a \"good\" ending for just about everyone. Yes it is depressing at first but again it helps one to think on the message (one I personally saw) and look at things from a viewpoint of someone who is brought back, scared, and does not wish to die. Same as the humans do not wish to die- but wish to see passed friends and family. Humans can be the true monsters- while all together it can be concluded that there are good and bad humans and non-humans. \\n\\n\r\nShiki was amazing and I'll re-watch it some day. It also gave me a sense of \"justice\" and how life can be unfair- but in the end...the one who \"wins\" will have committed the ultimate sin against their brother. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Shiki is an old-fashioned vampire story with a lot of bite. If you were looking for angsty, romantic and sympathetic bloodsuckers, you may wish to look elsewhere, as this is very much a traditional horror story with nightmarish figures prowling outside (hopefully) your window. Shiki relies mainly on pyschological fright with limited but effective use of violence, but squeamish watchers should be aware that there are nevertheless scenes of intense violence, particularly towards the end of the show. For instance, the operating table scene is one of the most twisted and cruel scenes I've personally ever witnessed.\r\nOne of the interesting features of the show's storyis the mixed mythologies that Shiki draws from. As well as the ghostly aspect to the undead, Ono Fuyumi obviously owes a lot to Bram Stoker, particularly with regards to the themes of class struggle and foreign invasion. The noble status of the vampires constrasts sharply with the earthy, country folk of the village and their ensuing struggle for dominance is therefore inherently political.\\n\\n\r\nThere are no heroes, or unamibiguous good and evil (You'll even be sympathasing with Tatsumi by the end of the story. Maybe.) in Shiki and this complex portrayal of characters is another of the show's strengths. I particularly liked the character of the village doctor, Toshio Ozaki, who to some extent personifies the famous Nietzsche quote:\\n\\n\r\n\"If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't perfect however and one of the first things you will notice and possibly be turned off by is the artwork. I don't know what it is about the way people's hair is drawn, but it is rather ridiculous. It's almost as if everyone is an amateur scientist or wacky hair stylist who constantly experiments with static electricity to make their hair stand up. Also, the soundtrack is mainly subdued and spooky as you would expect, but the success of some of the funkier OSTs is a matter of taste.\\n\\n\r\nOverall however, Shiki is well worth a look for fans of the horror genre who don't object to a fairly traditional (and to some extent predictable) vampire story. It may not be groundbreaking in any sense, but it is a well told story and the climactic last 4 episodes didn't disappoint me.",

            "content": "This was another series that I had been meaning to jump into for quite a long time, I remembered seeing very bizarre scenes from one of the episodes that peeked my interest and made me want to run out and see what the show was all about.\r\nAnd to be quite honest, I was amazed by Shiki.\r\nStory - 9\r\nThe way that the story began was just so good. It set the atmosphere of a small creepy town with a dark secret so well and it was for me, more gripping of a start than Higurashi (still a big fan of that show!) just because of theway that it was done, despite the first few seconds of Higurashi being very morbidly disturbing.\\n\\n\r\nThere are of course a few similarities here and there with these two shows - like for instance the repetition of trying over and over to figure out what it is that's killing all of the folks in town. I don't know about you guys, but when the same thing is done again and again several times, it can become tiring to have to watch that repeat itself. I feel as if I've seen Higurashi's Keiichi Maebara step into the car with the detective one too many times.\\n\\n\r\nWhereas in Shiki, they are throwing a little more things at you each time that a body is found, and they are slowly introducing you to all sorts of characters in the show that you will either end up feeling repulsed by or that you will feel deeply sorry for, which is one of the things that I love about this show.\\n\\n\r\nI am always at least a little bit disappointed to find out that the killing creatures of any show or movie ends up being vampires, but in this case it didn't bother me as much as it normally would have. In other words as many I'm sure have already made clear - This is no Twilight. The vampires in Shiki are something to be terrified of. But also, something to give you a strike of immense sadness for.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\\n\r\nAgain, it was the very unique art-style of Shiki that caught my attention. The designs of these characters in particular, with their wild colorful hair is quite a sight, and some people find it to be ridiculous. Although in my opinion it was a factor of the show that made it more creative. \\n\\n\r\nThere are so many haunting images within the art of this animation that could make your skin crawl. I think they did a wonderful job of that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe eerie soundtrack to this anime is just so, so beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nIt really captures the despair and cruelty of both the vampires and the humans. You can just feel the sorrow of their stories as soon as you hear the music being played. It was one of the very few times that I was able to immediately feel that enchanted by the background music of an anime. \\n\\n\r\nI also loved the opening & ending themes - all again very chilling and at the same time very saddening, in a charming way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\\n\r\nMegumi Shimizu can be related to by anyone who has that feeling of being trapped in a small town and pointed out for being different. \\n\\n\r\nI give Shiki so much credit for capturing the creepy feeling of what it's like to be talked about as soon as you are new in a tiny place like that, they really nail the unnatural gossip of the towns characters when Natsuno comes to live there. And ironically, that is another thing that I find creepiest about the show - the people that actually live in the town. \\n\\n\r\nOne of my absolute favorite characters was doctor Toshio Ozaki. He had such a cool vampire hunter vibe of taking methods into his hands and trying to lead the villagers against the vampires, but at the same time, he is a very dark person for having committed a terrible act, of which you will discover for yourself if you have not yet seen the show.  \\n\\n\r\nBy the end, I also loved little Sunako Kirishiki and found her to be a powerful character once you have learned just how much she has been through and how innocent she is, despite being a vampire. It is so easy to feel so sorry for her by the last few episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nI cannot think of any one moment in time where I was not totally loving Shiki. There were so many elements to it that were unique, creepily realistic, personally relatable, it provoked the most spooky emotions and it had so many cool aspects to it that I don't normally see in a show, especially with a horror about vampires.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nI was already recommending Shiki as soon as I finished watching it. It's become one of my favorite mystery/thriller anime of all time and I think you will like it if you are a fan of Higurashi like me!\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something disturbingly dark, eerie, mysterious, and all at the same time very beautiful, with a less common type of insight on vampires, it's more than likely that you'll enjoy Shiki! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I thought it's a mediocre story after watching first 9 episodes and skipped right to the last episode. And later I completed the rest of the series, and I'm so glad that I did. I would give the first half 7 out of 10, and the second half 9 out of 10. \r\nStory/Ideology and Characters\r\nThe first half is simply story telling, and some characters of the episodes are pretty immature, like Megumi or Masao (Honestly, this guy is one of the most stupid characters in the series, although he's a tragedy himself.) The second half brought into light many interesting issues. Like how people areunwilling to accept an unintuitive fact that they are not willing to accept, whether killing shiki is a \"justice\" thing to do, and how people start to murder those innocent, including Muroi's mother etc. Also it later reveals the reason why Muroi attempted to commit suicide. It's a reason I can completely relate to.\\n\\n\r\nToshio and Muroi have two typical and completely different reaction to the situation. One is to hunt down every shiki, and the other admits that killing others in order to keep one alive is of course not right, yet not wrong either. \"Killing is never justice, no matter what kind of noble cause one upholds.\" Sunako also pointed out that death treats everything equally and that there is no death that is not terrible. I think the audience probably also can be divided by their preference of the two opinions. The two types are pretty extreme. Most people may fall somewhere between the two.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\\n\r\nMusic is not very impressive in my opinion. I watched the BD episodes with Japanese audio, but the background music gets cut off sometimes...The OST does fit the series, but it's simple (Simplicity itself is not bad. It's the music that's not great.), not something that would surprise people.\\n\\n\r\nTwo bonus episodes\\n\\n\r\nThe bonus episodes are pretty good. Usually bonus episodes of an anime are about something not so related to main story and are completely extra, but it's not the case here. Episodes 20.5 and 21.5 are great side stories from viewpoints of two people living in the village. \\n\\n\r\nHasegawa in episode 20.5 directly points out the brutality and unnaturalness of the fact that most people behave incredibly cool towards killing shiki, not treating them as humans at all, kill humans who are just sucked and take that for granted. Arguably they're doing it just to protect themselves, but Shiki kill humans to protect themselves too. How're they so different from Shiki after all? \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 21.5 is about how a woman gets crazy, due to the death of her family and the whole situation. It's nice to have the episodes, since most people behave quite normally and it's not weird to have some people go crazy given what they've experienced.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a great story that brings up interesting questions. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: In the quiet village of Sotoba, what began as a handful of unusual deaths grows into a what appears to be a full on epidemic as the villagers grow sick and die shortly after. Ozaki Toshio (Ookawa, Tooru), the head of the hospital in Sotoba, attempts to save the villagers case-by-case but can\u2019t seem to match their symptoms to any preexisting condition and as he fails repeatedly he begins to suspect that their illnesses may be the product of something other than an epidemic. Yuuki Natsuno (Uchiyama, Kouki), one of many students in Sotoba, discovers thatsome of his deceased friends and classmates have returned to life and that the deaths and illnesses of the villagers can be attributed to the recent arrived residents of the Kanemasa mansion overlooking the village. Along with their friends and colleagues the two characters work to defeat the Shiki \u2013 vampire-like creatures that survive by drinking the blood of humans and resurrect those bitten as allies.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]: \\n\\n\r\nWith all things considered, Shiki has a pretty large cast if only because a reasonable amount of detail is given to the individual families and characters of Sotoba to better present the village setting and provide context and impact to the string of deaths caused by the Shiki throughout the show. Normally, with so many background characters the show would pay the greatest amount of attention to a handful of main characters that pull us through the narrative such as Toshio or Natsuno however this isn\u2019t quite the approach of Shiki. While there is considerable character development on the part of Toshio it is not the central focus of Shiki and is fairly light elsewhere. The cast of the show can more or less be divided up into two factions \u2013 the human villagers and the Shiki along with those who have been resurrected. The Shiki or Vampires themselves are woefully underrepresented for a good deal of the show however once the show gets rolling around the mid point their side of the story becomes far more interesting than one would initially expect however things are fairly slow to get going in this regard. I believe that their side is ultimately an interesting one however to say that they and those they \u2018turned\u2019 were interesting from the get go would be a stretch.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the refreshing elements present in Shiki was the intelligence of some of its characters, most chiefly that of Toshino. While the show utilizes a fairly classic and sterotypical take on vampires, Toshino\u2019s methods and methodical thinking breathes new life into the premise. Through his scientific approach we explore what is happening to the victims of the Shiki on a biological level; while this doesn\u2019t entirely dismiss the supernatural nature of the Shiki it does help establish a believable place for them within the presented universe. Furthermore the characters are perfectly aware of vampires and vampire lore and much of what Toshino attempts to do is born out of what he knows from fictional vampire tales as he attempts to discern what does and doesn\u2019t work.\\n\\n\r\nWhile some characters felt right at home within the plot and even developed quite well there were also a decent number of people that felt under-explored and out of place within the story. My chief concern was with the character of Seishin Muroi, a young priest and author as well as a friend of Toshino. He initially felt relevant and purposeful within the story however as things progressed his role is somewhat dimished and his character begins to make less and less sense. Despite him having his own allegorical story alongside Shiki which somewhat investigates his character he never arrives at a place where I can understand him or his actions and so he felt a little awkward within the story despite his actions being important.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest stumbling points of Shiki as cited by anyone that has seen the show is its character designs which are problematic for a variety of reasons. Firstly, a good deal of them are absolutely bizarre \u2013 their hair styles are unrealistic and needlessly eccentric, their color  schemes are often an eyesore, and some of their outfits are pretty outlandish. That being said where the real damage is done is in the juxtaposition of these designs and both their narrative and fictional settings. Shiki is a horror thriller and so such flamboyant designs somewhat damages the atmosphere of the show and can cheapen what otherwise might be emotional moments. Furthermore, the setting of Shiki is full of dark tones and so the pinks, blues, and greens present in the characters contrast pretty poorly with their otherwise beautiful backdrop.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, I found that I got used to the designs after a while and while some of the characters were quite ridiculous, at least the greater part of the main characters were more conservatively designed and weren\u2019t nearly as aesthetically aggressive. Another positive point of the designs is that they occasionally lended themselves well to the horror themes rather than tarnishing them of as their otherworldliness worked well in this regard. As the character designs were one of the reasons I had put off watching Shiki until I did I can now say that, while most of them are unsightly, they aren\u2019t enough of a reason to avoid the show in my eyes as the plot and characters make up for whatever the show lacks aesthetically.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nShiki is most definitely a slow burn as it starts out at a near snail\u2019s pace as it opts to first establish the village setting and methodically introduce the mysterious string of deaths that gives rise to the ultimate plot of the show. The show picks up the pace around the half-way point however not excessively so and not to the point where the show could be called anything but \u2018slow to unfold\u2019. I think this worked well enough for Shiki and while it dragged on near the beginning I think the pacing worked well for the methodical approach the show exhibited. The time it took to establish a few characters and more importantly the dynamic of the villagers was important to the story because it relied so heavily on killing off characters and bringing some back. Without the prior time investment put towards defining each family and individual character at a shallow level the deaths would have had no impact whatsoever and so the ultimate drama of the show and horror implications would be lost within the plot.\\n\\n\r\nWhile one might not immediately think this upon viewing the show\u2019s aesthetic or hearing its premise, Shiki is a fairly intelligent horror story for a number of reasons. A few of its more central characters act quite rationally and in a logistical fashion which can sometimes be rare in horror settings however I think it was done well here. Furthermore, while it may have been more interesting to create an original monster for the sake of the story, Shiki\u2019s usage of a rather classic depiction of Vampires worked well for what the show wanted to do. By having the Shiki grounded in this depiction as well as making the characters aware of the old stories associated with vampires it makes the setting more relatable to the viewer as it depicts a case where the obviously supernatural intrudes upon an otherwise normal setting.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, on this point, the story eventually gets around to raising an interesting moral question pertaining to the humans of the village and the Shiki. Due to their underrepresentation early on and lack of nearly any compelling traits for half the show its hard to see how any moral question regarding the Shiki could be interesting while only looking at the first half of the show however the latter half does a good job setting up context in order to better understand the Shiki and their situation. While one\u2019s enjoyment doesn\u2019t necessarily hinge on whether or not they identify or care about the moral themes brought up towards the end of the show, I would say that a great deal of my own enjoyment is derived from this element as this is the area where Shiki takes a step beyond being a traditional vampire horror story and postulates something engaging. Though the messages and events that surround this moral question can be a bit hamfisted in execution at times, I think the show is quite compelling because the presence of these themes as they push Shiki beyond what might otherwise be a fairly typical vampire story.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music of Shiki was effective in some ways and ineffective in others. The soundtrack and of the most often recurring songs struck a tone somewhere between being haunting and being sentimental which worked really well for the show because of its horror themes as well as its focus on characters. Only a choice few songs really stood out to me and there were a small number that felt out of place because of their techno influence or chorus elements however I grew used to these as the show progressed. I would say that the soundtrack succeeded for the most part in creating a haunting and ominous atmosphere despite the occasional odd song.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nShiki has its pros and cons however I think it was net good while still falling short of being something great. It was certainly worth the watch and despite its methodical narrative style I found myself interested in each following episode up until the end though this may not be the case with everyone. As a side note, I think watching the show along with its specials in the intended order is beneficial as they retroactively provide direct character insight to some background characters that flush out some of the themes of the show as well as create opportunities for better characterization overall. At the same time, they occur fairly late in the show around episodes 20 and 21 and so they may arrive a bit later than they are needed however are valuable additions to the show nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 7\\n\\n\r\nDespite having problematic character designs and a few odd characters, Shiki pulls through with a good story, interesting themes, and decent music that capitalizes on the tone of the show. I gave the show a 7 because the good outweighed the bad and while the unpleasant elements of the show keep it from going any higher, Shiki was still one of the better horror thrillers I have seen in some time and its intelligent characters and story kept it interesting throughout.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nShiki is most primarily a horror / thriller story and so I would recommend it to fans of that genre however, to push this, I would also say that this show was a case of \u2018Vampires done right\u2019 as the additional implications surrounding the Shiki were quite compelling and any fan of vampire lore or fiction would likely enjoy the show. While Shiki does have some mystery elements they are never many in number or all that lengthy in nature and so I wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend it to fans of mystery however it does feature exhibit some elements of the genre while providing next to no dramatic irony. Lastly, Shiki, as I\u2019ve mentioned above, is a slow burn and so viewers who desire something more immediate might want to either watch the show over a long period of time or stay away from it entirely.",

            "content": "What starts off as an innocuous looking show about a typical pink haired teenager wanting more from her humble country town turns into some of the darkest, most immersive vampire lore you\u2019ve ever experienced. Unlike your usual vampire shows (such as Twilight), that just assumes the watcher is a dribbling idiot, Shiki puts in the effort to reward their audience\u2019s intelligence with subtle hints and a surprisingly human approach to the entire situation. It has us all asking the question, \u201cwho is the real bad guy?\u201d\r\nIn a vampire anime, you\u2019d expect the vampires to be the bad guys. In 99% of cases you\u2019d expect it.But Shiki delves that gap between the two races, and has us thinking that maybe they\u2019re just trying to survive too. After all, these vampires are crippled by sunlight and can only thrive by drinking the blood of a human. To put it in perspective, would you consider yourself the bad guy for eating beef? That little niggle of doubt adds so much more to the realism than any kind of antagonist who is merely evil for the hell of it.\\n\\n\r\nMost horror anime rely on jump scares to shock us all out of our seats. Shiki doesn\u2019t even try this. Instead, it instills a constant sense of oncoming dread, with subtleties and inflections that make you feel to uneasy that, instead of jumping from your seat, you\u2019re damned near unable to remove yourself. Every episode (past the first) is a visceral, morbid roller coaster ride, and when the horror hits, it\u2019s terrifying.\\n\\n\r\nShiki does have a bit of a lull in the first episode, mostly due to two dull main characters living their vapid lives and complaining for more. But that quickly changes when a mystery disease spreads throughout the village, turning people into vampires over the course of a few days.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks are a bit hit and miss; some exceptional, some forgettable. However, the ones that hit the target get the bullseye, purveying the mood perfectly. Be it slow and ominous, or high-pitched and desperate, it reflects a vampire attack brilliantly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shiki is an experience, perhaps the be all and end all of vampire anime. Just have a bit of patience at the start, because like with all things vampire, it takes the main character to die, for the show to come alive.",

Could've easily been a 12 episode anime \r\n- Creator takes a passive stance i.e. It is unclear whether he wishes to side with the good or evil as the story seems to slant in the favor of either interchangeably \r\n- Several information loopholes here and there.\r\n- Inconsistent character development i.e. Far too many characters. Story does not follow the perspective of a main character, but rather switches between 2-3 of them. There is also no reasonwhy a few characters are emphasised, such as megumi. Most importantly (and in contrast), there is a severe lack of development for characters on the \"evil\" side.\\n\r\n- Plot itself is fair, could've been much better if it was more compact and if there was substantial character development. \\n\r\n- Came for the horror (like Another), didn't get it\\n\r\n- Ending not satisfying (at all) \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\n- Fair. Just like your standard anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\n- Pretty fitting music. Plus point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\n- Characters are portrayed as lifelike as possible, so don't expect any supreme fighter etc\\n\r\n- Most of the characters reacted to situations as though as they were 3 year olds (a major flaw that gets you really triggered)\\n\r\n- Decent character growth/progression for two of the main characters, albeit a little too late and rushed\\n\r\n- Too many supporting cast \\n\r\n- Prepare to face really detestable characters\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\n- Definitely nowhere near Another\\n\r\n- Many issues compounded (pacing, characters, story progression), resulting in a frustrating watch\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\n- Wouldn't recommend this\\n\r\n- Wouldn't rewatch\\n\r\n- Watch if you really wish to spend time on anime and have no other alternatives",

            "content": "This series is so abysmal that I really think I should write a line or two about it.\r\nTL: DR version. Shiki sucks so much that it made a 360 degrees turn and it ended sucking more. If you enjoy watching the worst characters ever made, please do. \r\nStory: 2\r\nI won't write a synopsis, there are already too many of them.\r\nI gave a 2, just because the premise could be interesting. Pity is that after the 2nd episode you already know where everything is going to go, and I had to suspend my disbelief so much that it will probably have to repeat a year. \r\nNothingthat happens makes sense, with actions driven by dumb characters that will make you jump off your seat, just by how dumb they are. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 1 I could probably have appreciated some of the backgrounds, or a few animations, but the character design has hurt me so much that I think I will have to look for someone's comfort. Feels like Yu Gi Oh plus JoJo, plus dead people, but worse. I won't say much about the animation, not incredible nor awful, but I really want to point out that incredible \"NOOOOOOO\" scene, that gave me the chills. Like, embarrassment chills. \\n\\n\r\nSound: the only thing that actually works in the series. the dubbing is good, except for the usual, annoying creepy laughter; the music fits the moments, and the OPs and EDs are, erm... ok, I think?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1\\n\r\nBy now, I thought I would be used to retarded characters that just act retarded for 12 episodes. But usually there are a few of them, you know?\\n\r\nHandling with a whole town of retarded, for 24 whole episodes, tho, is really proving. \\n\r\nApart from the design, that makes you think that these guys spent way too much fixing their hair instead of thinking logically, there is absolutely no logic behind their actions. \\n\r\nWhenever you see a character deciding something, in the remote chance that this happens, it's a completely stupid decision. It's so incredibly impossible to be empathic with any of them, that I ended laughing when anyone died while the others looked with shocked eyes. The hell, it's the hundredth death, you should have at least an idea of what's happening now, don't you? \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nI manage to complete the series and actually had lots of fun watching stupid people doing moronic things, but I presume that wasn't the meaning behind the show. No, that sucked, like, a lot.",

            "content": "Hello everyone. This is CrimsonDeath (Crimson for short) bringing you my first ever review on not only anime/manga, but basically anything I've ever done previously, so please don't be too harsh if my writing is executed poorly. Note that I will try my best to not give away spoilers or mention the storyline more than needed. Enough about me though, let's move on to the anime in review itself.\r\nThe anime in question this time is Shiki, an anime that left me with many tears in my eyes while and after watching due to its sad and dark nature. It involves mystery and supernatural elements althoughwe're not allowed to say what these are because it is actually a spoiler. I am not as fond of this particular genre as some other people mind you, but this anime was just too good for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10\\n\\n\r\nI congratulate this anime for the story it has brought all of us to enjoy! The basic idea behind the plot is to keep the identity of the real enemy hidden to the main characters but give the viewer a pretty accurate guess as to who/what the enemy is. Whether you realise who is threatening the village or not, this anime is going to keep you from not wanting more. There are many elements in this anime that excel in the particular setting like the ambitions of people and the fact that humans are fragile creatures and can break with a small push, and this is what I enjoyed most.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\\n\r\nFirst I would like to give huge props to the animation studio that designed the main antagonists. The whole concept is expressed beautifully through the colours of the eyes and skin, whilst giving off a sad aura that touches the viewer. More in general, the rest of the characters are very well made, uniquely representing everyone's character in some way or another. The backgrounds and environment were really colourful and detailed at all times. I have no complaints from this, although some people might find the hairstyles of some of the charcacters weird or too much. I personally liked them.\\n\r\nThe thing I am amazed with is what I always call \"the death faces\". It's basically a dead man's/woman's face right before/after they die. This always sent chills down my spine whenever I saw it and, since it happens a lot, you can guess I felt like I was in a refridgerator for more than half of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM was really fitting the mood in most cases, which enhances the feeling being given off from the anime even more.\\n\r\nThe 2 Openings were very beautiful, namely \"Kuchizuke\" performed by Buck-Tick and \"Calendula Requiem\" performed by kanon*kanon, with the latter being my favorite of the two. The first Ending theme, \"Walk no Yakusoku\" by nangi was really not to my liking while the second one, \"Gekka Reijin\" by Buck-Tick was really good. These songs tried their best to fit the dark theme of the anime and I have to say that they succeeded in doing so.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\\n\r\nNow comes the good part. Every, single, freakin, character is unique and their purposes different. Seeing how there is so much death in this anime most characters don't go in too much depth, but there is a crapload of them and they all ahve unique characteristics which help you distinguish them. There are a few main characters which I will mention independently.\\n\\n\r\nOzaki Toshio - is what you call the main protagonist of this series, if you view the anime from a point that I don't. Watch the anime and you will understand what I'm talking about. He is the village's doctor and runs his own clinic. This guy is the generic badass of the series, always having a cigarette lit between his lips. He is the one suspecting and acting first before everyone else, trying to save everyone from their tragic fate. A very interesting character, maybe a little too strong for the anime's standards, but his weak side is exposed a hell of a lot.\\n\\n\r\nMuroi Seishin - Toshio's best friend, the local priest of Sotoba whose hobby is writing books, mostly novels. Seishin is pretty much the opposite of Toshio, being the voice of reason many times and keeping a generally neutral stance in all this. He is also the one human who comes in contact with the other main character the most in the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nKirishiki Sunako - The main character of the series, if you view the anime from the point that I do. Whilst being the main character she is also the main antagonist of this series. She is a little girl whose past is shrouded in mystery and has been shutting herself in the European style mansion on top of the big hill of the village. Only she and God know her true purposes. She may look like a ten-year-old girl but the speeches she presents to basically Seishin placed me in deep thought.\\n\\n\r\nYuuki Natsuno - Another character that deserves mention in this segment since he does some pretty important stuff. Right. This is the boy who recently moved in Sotoba and hates the place. Literally loathes it. His one and only wish is to leave this place and return to the big city whence he came. At first he was holed up within himself, never opened up to anyone because he did not want anything to have with these \"primitive\" people. One day he met a fellow villager when he had a flat tyre on his bicycle, who helped him repair it. Thus he opened up to this one and only person who became his sole friend. What he noticed from the start though was a young girl's stares and later a tragic involvement with her that would change his life forever.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that the air the anime gave off was really heavy, certainly an anime not for everyone. This anime needs you to have a good stomach and a not-so-easy-to-break heart if you want to go through it in one piece. Since I am pretty open when it comes to anime and will watch pretty much anything, I really felt this was really my kind of anime, making me enjoy it a lot, so much that it deserves a 10/10 for this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is my third favorite anime and for good reason. I would like to say right now that I didn't want to begin with such a difficult to review anime but I wanted to test my skills in this to see how far I can reach. I would also like to add another grading, being the rewatchability of the anime. I know plenty of people who like to watch the same anime over and over again when they have nothing better to do, so rewatchability of an anime is pretty important to some people.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRewatchability - 7\\n\\n\r\nNote that this score does not count to the overall since it is something that is not applied for all people and clearly comes down to personal preference.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, I hope you enjoyed reading through this tedious wall of text. Any constructive criticism and feedback is kindly appreciated. If you find any faults in my grammar or english in general, well, you won't.",

I don't know how many people could watch this and says it horrible. It was probly a little confusing to some people in the beginning (even though it gave some strong points leading to vampires) it wasn't all that bad. Not gonna spoil but i liked the ending in some aspects but not all, the brutality of it all wasn't the best part. But so and so escaping from the burning (building) really gaveme some hope. :)\\n\\n\r\nOk to start it off...\\n\\n\r\nStory:10\\n\r\ni loved the way it was played out absolutely brilliant story with a ton of twists to it one of the best storylines i've seen in a while no doubt.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nI liked the art the isn't a big factor in my rating as long as its not bad enough to see.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nThe openings and Endings were both beautifully played at music to my ears to listen to. literally music to my ears. Special thanks to Kanon x Kanon for the beautiful song. Even the sound effects in the anime were good. ^.^\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:9\\n\r\nI'm just gonna point this out but my favorite character: Megumi Shimizu\\n\r\nI know alot of people don't like her but whats not to like. One of my favorite anime characters ever from the start... Past that all the characters were good each one had there own special personality including (Ozaki) Toshio,  (Yuuki) Natsuno, (Ookawa) Tomio, and (Shimizu) Megumi.\\n\r\n R.I.P. :'(\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10!\\n\r\nIt was a very enjoyable anime it kept me on the edge of my seat, i also fell off a few times xD It has a brilliant  storyline that kept you guessing and amazing twists that kept you saying Whats gonna happen next! I would recommend this anime to anyone that enjoys GREAT anime like i do :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10\\n\r\nIt was an amazing story that took you into olden myths of vampires and humans that fight back against them. One of the best fall animes this season right up there with star driver\\n\r\nAgain anyone with some time and high expectations try watching it sometimes.",

Now, I get freaked out very easily and there was moments that did scare me; most notably a scene in Episode 4, but once you get into the series you will notice it is a light horror if anything, if you want an intense horror anime then I will tell you right now Shiki might disappoint you. \r\nStory (7):\r\nShiki's story is definitelyan interesting one to say the least. Sotoba, a small distant town, begins peaceful and neighborly until an epidemic seems to appear killing several people each and every day. As days go by the once known Sotoba is seemingly flipped upside down into a much gloomier town.  It attempts to make you think about the other side of things, and oddly enough reveals the evil in good and the good in evil. Vampires in most stories are considered to be monsters, evil beings. Shiki goes against this common thought and tries to lead you into believing that Vampires are just beings fighting for their life just like humans. While I enjoyed this story it had a few loose ends, most notably in the ending episodes, that just simply don't flow right at all. Although it is nice to see a Vampire story that is original but at the same time sticking to it's roots and if you enjoy classic Vampire stories this may be the one for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9):\\n\r\nPersonally I loved the art, it was very unique. Most say that this art style doesn't fit in but I would have to disagree with that. Much like the story portrays two sides I feel the art also has two sides. One moment you are gawking at the crazy hairstyles and beautiful clothing and then you are caught off guard with the much more horrific side of something that seemed once so beautiful. I love the way things clash together, but beautifully. The eyes, above everything else, are very nice and detailed- they themselves define characters and are beautifully done if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8):\\n\r\nThe sound was also well done. It added to the terror, or the sadness, and every other feeling you will feel throughout this anime. To say in short the sound just seems to fit in with each situation so well that you won't even notice that it is compelling you to feel a certain way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5):\\n\r\nThis is where I was disappointed. Big time. I can't honestly say there is many like able characters in this series. The vampires are made to look like monsters at the beginning and then go through a very quick last minute transition in the last few episodes where you are supposed to begin to feel for them. I felt by then it was to late to sympathize with any of them. The villagers are also purposely made out to be stupid, gossipy, small town people that you just can't help but get annoyed by. Everyone seems to be useless except the doctor who isn't even very like able either. He throws away all his feelings and becomes obsessed with his research. It obviously taints him (and almost all of the village) to the point where they are just as bad as the vampires and you pretty much have lost respect for everyone. The only few like able characters get very few screen time, died to early, or just suddenly disappear without much of an explanation; or better yet no explanation at all like the siblings (most notably the brother.) Of course you can't expect much character development when people are constantly dying but come on. It was lacking too much in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7):\\n\r\nIn the end Shiki was at least worth the watch. Although there were a few plot holes here and there, and some things did seem lacking or hypocritical, it was still enjoyable. What I can say is it makes you think about your views on certain things and is definitely not your average take on an anime. I would recommend watching it either way, what's 22 episodes of your time?",

            "content": "Although slow to start, Shiki is a really interesting anime that depicts a continuous struggle between a village, and a ruthless vampire outbreak.\r\nAll in all, the whole show is consistent with its relatively dreary subject matter - which is suitable in the way it builds and builds on a  death count throughout to really give the viewer a sense of severity and scale: everything draws towards a climax.\r\nAfter watching a few episodes, the story becomes inevitable, but you're still curious as to what follows. The main entertainment here - besides the gore: we'll get back to that. Is seeing the conflicting ways in whichthe characters/villagers adapt and develop in what the show conveys as an almost apocalyptic-like scenario - despite how the village is so insignificant on a larger scale. \\n\\n\r\nAlike a lot of successful horror/actions, Shiki isn't afraid to \"kill off\" (though it's arguable whether someone's dead or not in this show) particularly important characters. It's great at bringing forth a dark, suspenseful atmosphere, that goes hand in hand with the relentless, sombre civil war between the species.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show persists, it becomes a lot deeper - the \"corpses\" are FAR from mindless. They struggle, and emote equally, which really highlights an even bolder war: between good and evil. Regardless of who you think you're in favor of, Shiki will force upon you this sense of emotional struggle and morals. Really making you question who's in the right - if anyone...\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of a minus side; some of the earlier episodes are particularly uneventful, the art is Ok, and the story is more concept based than \"twisty and turny\". This may drive viewers away, but i implore you to stay. Stay and observe as the ever-changing state of the village, revolutionizes the way the characters coexist - or fail to.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The other problem is the pace, he goes slow, remains slow and ends slow, it's amazing how even the action parts give no emotion and no deaths have an impact do you surprised or feel sorry character, the only thing I want is to end soon and fast.\\n\\n\r\nNot that I think Shiki is all bad, on the contrary it could have been better if they had worked more, but wasting a good potential is a little something foul, no content and that many find",

            "content": "I went into this with no expectations what so ever. I had never heard of this one before and didn\u2019t do my normal research for it so had no idea what I was getting myself into. All I knew was that it was of the supernatural and so wanted to see this for myself.\r\nThe story starts out with a woman, Megumi Shimizu, that died and then goes back about 11 days before she died. The whole time, it felt like a mystery like When They Cry and I think that\u2019s why I fell in love with it more. Now I didn\u2019t like this character verymuch when she was alive. She was a total bitch in every since of the word and always trying to dress up in these really dressed up clothing. She was mean to everyone in the town except Natsuno Yuuki who she had a very large crush on. I hated the character Masao even more then Megumi. I don\u2019t know exactly why though, it was just one of those things that kept making me think he was going to die.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story goes on, it introduces us to a bunch of characters that are in the town. When they got to Toshio Ozaki, I really thought he might be related to Yuuki because there hair looks almost exactly alike. \\n\\n\r\nIn a way, this also turned out to be like Durarara or Baccano in the way that it hops from character to character, to show little pieces of the story. The story is fast and they show dates for what time has gone by luckily. I kind of see it as a dairy of sorts like the book Dracula. It is also very talkative, not action based although there a lot of times it has an air that something will happen and pretty much blow up. About half way threw, there was a lot more going on and it actually gets more and more fast passed. \\n\\n\r\nThe show luckily tries to give you enough information to know what\u2019s going on and for you to try to figure out for yourself but just like a lot of detective shows, it doesn\u2019t show it all. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening animation feels a lot like a James Bond movie with how the artwork is placed. The animation looks a little odd, but it\u2019s hard to actually explain what is off about the animation. It seems a bit soft with not many black lines about it. A couple of characters look almost the same and seem like they are actually related but they don\u2019t seem to show that they are related. And what is up with Natsuno\u2019s hair? It\u2019s all over the place and a mess. It\u2019s like he is always walking around with a bad case of bed hair. Actually, everyone has strange stiff hair. Its ether bed head or stiff turns in the hair. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is pretty good, a very hunting sound and keeps the tension. This show doesn\u2019t have any comedy really and so in turn, the music doesn\u2019t leave you much to relax. The first opening is rather catchy but the second seems to lack just a bit. The English voices are well put and work with their characters. I found none of them to be really annoying or bothersome except one that showed up in ep 3. The guy is really creepy anyway and I\u2019m happy he hasn\u2019t shown up much.\\n",

            "content": "My friend reccomended Shiki saying it was one of his favorite anime's. I watched 1 episode and I really wasn't convinced because the main charachter in that episode was an ungrateful, obsessive bitch so it stood on my list for weeks. I figured I would try another episode, and I was hooked; I really couldn't stop watching. Despite being awesome, gory, and scary. It really makes you think about death, especially in the conversations between Seishin and Sunako. Later on in the series you actually start to feel really bad for the shiki's. With every death, you notice people deteriorating mentally. I really don't wantto spoil anything so I'll end with this. There are actually 24 episodes, when you've watched episode 20, look for episode 20.5 and after 21, look for 21.5. Whilst not really that important to the story, you should really watch them. In my opinion they're 2 of the most intense episodes. P.S. don't watch this if you like sleeping in a bed.\\n\r\nOverall: It's a really good anime, the animation is amazing, there are gripping moments, sad moments and it really makes you think about how meaningless life is and how terrible death is.\\n\\n\r\nJesus Christ",

Just because I thought that something was better than you thought or worse than you thought, doesn't mean that I did a \"Bad review\". If I did a \"Bad Review\" than I wouldn't have cared to make a review in the firstplace. Also, I can understand if I might have said something that offended you, upset you, or whatever, but I literally can't quite helpthat. I certainly can make a review that deserves \"Constructive Criticism\", but I certainly don't intend on EVER making a \"Bad Review\" of anything. Anyway, rant over. Onto another review.\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever watched a vampire anime, and thought that it was just going to be awful and somewhat reminiscent of Twilight? Then watch this and see for yourself, because I was VERY surprised when I saw this. I thought it was going to be a very stupid anime, and I was DEAD wrong (No pun intended).\\n\\n\r\nThe Story was about a small village in rural Japan, isolated from most parts of developed society, like the city or the town a few miles away. Everything in the village was fine, until a new family moved into the new Mansion that was built on top of the hill overlooking the village. One day, Megumi, a girl seeking a new life in the big city, went up there to see what its like and wasn't seen again until she was nearly dead. The strange occurrence of people getting sick with a mysterious disease baffled the village doctor and his nurses. It continued to baffle everybody. More and more people ended up like Megumi. The doctor was baffled and started looking into it. More and more strange things keep occurring and before you know it, many of the people that have been known and loved in the village either have died, moved away, or were stricken with grief over the fact that their loved ones have died. This plot was very intriguing, because I literally was baffled and I couldn't quite tell what was going to happen next at all. it was literally like one of the biggest mysteries of all time, except for the fact that once you know what the dead people were, you knew at least some of the same attributes of a vampire were the same, but they were different in several different aspects. Also, there were \"Special\" vampires that could look like normal humans and could walk out in the sun too. That was also very cool. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art was simply amazing. It didn't quite look as good at different moments when the \"vampires\" were walking around at night or appeared at night, at different times. But it just simply looked amazing. Even the blood looked realistic, at times, and that was also cool. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this was simply astonishing. It may have been the same song played in the anime, but my word, they used different pitches and tones for the song to fit different settings and situations. The openings and endings were great too, but nowhere near as good as the music within the anime. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters were probably the weakest part of the anime,  but they are still very well done, for the most part. My favorite was the Doctor, and he literally was one of the smartest people in the village, understandably so. He knew how to combat the situation in a way that befitted science. However, you get the contrast of ideals with his best friend, the priest at the temple, who tried to welcome and accept the vampires as living creatures as well. The priest wasn't really even as great as the doctor, but he sure did play his part well and seem like an individual. All the other characters were great overall, but some of the supporting characters were literally characters I despised and was glad that they had died. You could find some trope of people within this village to at least sympathize with and that is what makes them great overall. Like, I didn't particularly like Megumi very much, but it just was unfortunate that she had to become a vampire. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime left me BAFFLED and STUNNED at how good it was. It wasn't the absolute best anime out there, but it was SO much better than I expected. Literally, I was left guessing, for the most part, at what would happen next, because they used the story and the characters in a way that helped to add some creepiness and yet some somberness to it. You didn't know who was going to die next, until maybe later on, when it became more apparent whom was on who's side. (10/10) for enjoyment and (9/10) overall.",

            "content": "Well just finished watching this series, and wow... just wow! But yeah.. I shall break it down as best as I can and just tell you just why you need to watch this anime....\r\nStory: Well put in short terms I thought the story was amazing, it was one of those storylines that gets you thinking, like pretty deeply, well thats what it did with me, I think its about survival, and I found myself constantly siding with each group of people. But in a way I found it to be a loose-loose situation no matter what happened, and it was just so powerful in howit was potrayed (the last few episodes literally left me in awe) it gets you feeling angry, sad, confused! Everything and that for me, shows just how well they have planned out and executed the story so well. Basically two groups of people fighting to survive, at points it was actually hard to watch, and I wondered myself what would I do in the situation and it genuinly leaves you frustrated and in deep thought. Sure there are the odd less exciting filler episodes where not too much goes on, and there a little mundane, but are totally worth watching and getting through, even if its just to get to the last 5-6 episodes because I think those alone made the whole series. But the story had twist, turns, depth, passion, horror and even a tad romance, theres notthing much that I can personally ask for in a storyline.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Well as I've said, I'm easily pleased when it comes to art, I dont think I will ever be too disapointed with what comes on the screen, but I loved the animation in this, very fluid and eyecatching, not exactly the most bright of colours if anything very dull and sad, which fits pefectly with the effect that there going for. So apologies for not being able to expand too much on the art but I thurally enjoyed it and I dont really see any complaints to tell you about, it does its job, and very well. So... if the glove fits.......\\n\\n\r\nSound: Well this was another gem for me, I shall talk about the opening and ending themes in a second, but I wanted to make a special mention for the background music, especially when used in the last 2-3 episodes, you have no idea the impact it had on me, at one point it gave me chills. It added so much more emotions to some of the scenes it was really very haunting and chilling music to have, and it just brought some of the scenes to live, so top marks for that. As for the opening and ending themes, i must say I preferred the the ones used in the first 12 episodes! I found the first opening to be very haunting and heavy and actually very catchy, I was more impressed however at the first ending sequence, the off key vocals and piano really made it seem very eerie and chilling, whether or not this was intended I dont know, but they semt to pull it off brilliantly. The second set of opening and endings were both for me pretty generic nothing new or special, whilst catchy yes.. didn't really fit with the feel of the series or add anything new, wheras I thought the first two (especially the ending) were quite unique and haunting.\\n\\n\r\nCharaters: Gosh so many characters that I could talk about, but as a whole the characters are very well developed with a wide range of personalities and traits which you learn to love and hate. Ranging from the ditzy 'blonde' (even though her hair is pink) who dreams of getting out of the small village to be star, to the leader/hero type from Toshi, to the wierd yet stangely cute character that is Sunako (one of my personal favourites from the series) it has hard to go into too much detail without rambling on as there are so many characters with so many different roles, all of which I thurally enjoyed watching, all I can say is watch and just see them all unfold, and really come into character! Towards the end you will most likely have your favourites and your most hated, and i hope its not just me but either way you do feel connected, and that is something I havent felt (or at least not this strongly) since watching anime, and this is something that really suprised me how deep you get into it, and just how much you feel for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well, pretty no-brainer really, this to put in simple terms was the anime that I found to be the most enjoyable, yes it was hard to watch at times, and sad, but yet it left me yearning for more (and keeping me up until 4am) it had everything that I have been looking for in anime, and I will certainly be watching the series again at some point.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Tbh my 9 rating is everybody elses 10, the only reason I have left it one short is just incase another anime comes along that is better (seen as though my list isn't very big atm) and also there was as I've said a few little boring episodes, but apart from that I honestly cannot fault this anime, Ive been sat there honestly trying to come up with the faults but aside from the few episdoes, and the generic opening and ending theme tune in the second half of the series I honestly can't and I dont see any reason why you shouldn't take the time to watch this, because I'd be very suprised if you didn't find it as powerful and as amazing as what most people have found it to be on this site.",

            "content": "Imagine that you are in a village where vampires are infested like a disease and you are trapped in a dangerous world where you might be in deep trouble. However, on second glance, some vampires have feelings and care about someone he or she loves and you sometimes sympathized on their treacherous and painful life as a vampire. That\u2019s what Shiki wants to express to the anime viewers and WOW! All I have to say is the director, Tetsuro Amino really compels on how humans and vampires interact for their survival of the fittest. Shiki is 100% NOT CLICH\u00c9 like Twilight Saga or True Bloodwhich I absolutely pissed me off with those love antics and teen fangasm (I\u2019m talking about you, Bella and Edward fans. Not to hate them but the series is not my cup of tea.) So I\u2019m glad that Shiki has a plot that surely compels everyone in the long run and I\u2019m truly satisfied with the overall anime quality.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe director, Tetsuro Amino, sure has something in his sleeves when plotting a great script for this anime. I never heard about the Shiki novels and mangas that were released at first but soon as I watched the anime fully, I am blown away on how this apparent horror story could become something unique and fascinating to see. No love clich\u00e9s, no fan service, just straight reality check on how humans and vampires live and fight in this one-on-one war for survival. It all starts at a village called Sotoba which experiences mysterious deaths that spreads like a pandemic that all focuses on one mysterious European classic house that was just suddenly appearing out of nowhere. As the story progresses, the mystery gets more interesting until found out that vampires are spreading the plague to the villagers and some brave souls, including the handsome and deadly Natsuno Yuuki and the serious doctor, Toshio Ozaki, are investigating this horrific phenomenon that wreck chaos to the village. What I like about the story here is how the story develops smoothly in 24 episodes and how the director resolute the entire vampire-human war in a unique way that even I sometimes care about some vampires who still have a humane heart surprisingly. Even though the pacing is a bit slow for something from 2010, but I have to say that the director really outdone the impossible by packing the plot into one fluid and solid story telling. The overall plot gives the entire dark horror feeling of Twilight but with balance in the characters. Plus, the final few episodes really manages well on one important decision: Self-preservation or Murder. Some might think that humans should survive and beat the hell out of those evil vampires but what about some vampires who still cares about his human life and then there are some who is being mind-controlled by those evil vampires as the villager\u2019s threat for survival. One things for sure, the directors have indicated for the viewers to think on their own opinions about the humans and vampires\u2019 self-beliefs right until the final Survival War and I got to give credits to them for imagining this creative idealism on human-vampire interaction. However, even though the ending feels like a decent wrap up for the story, I might have a feeling that they could make a second season because the ending felt too open for everyone to tell their opinion. However, all in all, solid storytelling and the mystery vibe that lives up to expectations surely makes Shiki the horror anime that made the grade.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe design of the characters gave Shiki some horror vibe that the anime supposed to be. With those glaring red pupil on the sinister antagonists makes the tone of this anime dark enough to realise that Shiki\u2019s horror and scary and not another cheap rip-off. Plus, with the darkness envelop Sotoba during night time, it has a perfect tone for this anime to attract those who wanted a darker, more cutting edge horror anime to be perfectly tone in animation. Though some of the animation designs are questionable sometimes like lack of hair movement in characters like Ritsuko\u2019s ponytail (as cassiesheepgirl pointed) and some characters are not that visually attracting to those who wanting quality. However, luckily, some gripe from the character\u2019s animation is balanced out with the perfect dark and eerie tone of the surrounding environment that surely has some meaning to this anime and although the art is not as breath-taking as today\u2019s anime standards, this anime still provides some gem in enhancing those horror fanatics to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nShiki\u2019s main attraction point however is amazing musical scores and sound effects that set up the entire gory horror tone to the anime. Yasuharu Takanashi have amazed me as an anime fan with haunting choral tracks and scary violin rhythm just scares the hell out of me, the soundtrack is absolutely a win in my books and I have to give credits for the music director for arranging a spectacular music score particularly to set the dark tone up. Plus, the sound effects also gives this anime life at its fullest and gives the viewers the real world experience into the entire vampire plague situation. On top of that, the seiyuus have done a wonderful job on portraying their characters well. Who could not forget the ever lovable Natsuno Yuuki, played by Kouki Uchiyama, who I adore so much with his serious expression on how the survival war goes and let\u2019s not forget other seiyuus who have done well in making their characters amazing like Shinya Takahashi, Haruka Nagashima, Haruka Tomatsu (Hate Megumi so much, but ADORE her voice perfectly) and let\u2019s not forget the KICK BUT AWESOME Toru Ohkawa. (Gotta love the Doctor Ozaki there) Overall, they have outdone themselves in managing the vocals and the voice behind this anime that I would feel like watching A TRUE horror anime thanks to the beautiful sound effects and character voices. AMAZING!\\n\\n\r\n Characters (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization in this series is quite interesting and wide in variety, which I like it decently. Yeah, some characters might be too annoying or rubbing too much salt to the viewer\u2019s eyes like Megumi (that darn goth girl\u2026) but some characters were pretty decently executed like Doctor Toshio who I think he executed his job well as the doctor who always keep focused on stopping the vampire plague and save the village although he\u2019s a bit annoying with his smoking attitude sometimes\u2026 I also like how Natsuno still being in confidence to end the vampire-human war although I felt that Natsuno was a bit nervous when fighting vampires before becomes one of them few episodes later and that\u2019s when Natsuno becomes an awesome cunning character that I love so much. The only problem with this anime is that with the abundance of characters, the creators might be in a rough edge to define each of the characters in the limited number of episodes. Some characters are one-episode wonder but then, they\u2019re just forgotten in the midst of main plot. Don\u2019t get me wrong, a few of those characters are interesting to watch but some\u2026 well, you get the point. However, the most compelling aspect of Shiki is the mass characterization of the Sotoba villagers\u2019 reactions to their own villagers becoming vampires and how would they cope with the entire survival war. I am quite impressed on how some of the main characters interact each other and how would they impact their mentality in some sort of form. This is not just vampire kill\u2019em all spree. Some vampires do left some caring perspective towards themselves and afraid of killing their enemies: humans, obviously. They just felt that being a vampire does not make you immortal and have super strength. They sometimes struggle to felt the guilt of exterminating humans with no mercy. Sure, there are some generic vampires who always kill humans LIKE A BOSS, but with the contrast of feelings of care and sympathy towards his/her dignity, I guess this anime surely delivers the punch it needs to make this anime really compelling to observe, especially making viewers rethink about all those assumptions that VAMPIRES ARE MONSTERS or VAMPIRES ARE EVIL and prove to them that even the hunger for blood really have their costs in their lives.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shiki left some enjoyable feelings to those die-hard anime fans, especially those who love vampires and eerie mysteries. Tetsuro Amino have delivered what it supposed to be one of more interesting horror animes that many fans have enjoyed. However, do in mind that this anime is not about comparing vampires or humans like being the antagonists or protagonists; hence this is not call a typical action anime that is the bread and butter of anything with action. However, this anime is more towards the value of humanity and reimagining the survival of the human race in a whole new meaning. Definitely, after you watch this anime, you will understand that not all humans are good and trusted and not all vampires like to suck blood and kill humans. It\u2019s what their perspective in their hearts that is important and Shiki surely delivers this really well. It\u2019s a horror, dark, eerie anime fill with mysteries and shocking truths that will satisfy your senses in all aspects. Shiki, a horror anime, redefined like no other.\\n\\n",

            "content": "To me, Shiki belongs in the same category as Code Geass and Future Diary. It is a show I would highly recommend seeing once. But ONLY once. \r\nShiki is a vampire anime, and definitely the most well-made vampire anime I've seen. Here is why. Nearly all vampire stories fall into 2 categories: Either all vampires are completely evil, and the humans have to work together to defeat them, or there are good and bad vampires, and the humans work together with the good vampires to defeat the bad vampires. And there is a reason why. From a moral standpoint, these are both very easy premises.Shiki is right in between those two. And it is not morally easy at all.\\n\r\nThere is some serious tragedy in this story. There are tragic human characters and tragic vampire characters. It is chilling and heartbreaking to the point of being difficult to watch at times. But I have to respect how well made it is. All the tragedies happen for a reason, and all are executed well. It is one of the better written shows I've seen. But it is not for the faint of heart. As an art piece, Shiki is beautiful the way an atomic explosion is beautiful.\\n\r\nThat's why I give it an 8. I think that you should see it. But only once.",

            "content": "I confess I only got into Shiki because someone told me Buck-Tick was doing the opening. Guilty! But I didn't regret it, the show is tremendously good. Still in the opening/ending topic, I hated the second opening because it was too... dance-ish, it had nothing to do with the feel of the series like Kuchizuke had. The second ending was nice (Buck-Tick nice ^^) but it didn't have much impact either. So, moving on.\r\nThe story is as follows: we're in a village cut off from the outer world, nested in the mountains. Its people live their ordinary lives with joy and without ambition, perfectly happywith the way things are and doing their best to avoid unusual situations. Enter Shimizu Megumi, a flashy highschool girl who wants nothing else than to escape her village and aim high, live a less-than-ordinary life. She is curious about the new family that moved in, the Kirishiki: a strange looking couple with their equally strange looking daughter and a tall, muscly guy with blue hair and dog ears (which reminds me that Shiki has the craziest hairstyles ever). Enter Natsuno Yuuki, the guy on whom Megumi has a huge crush on - almost on the verge of stalking. A guy who is also bored with his life and blames his parents for moving in this quiet village. One night, Megumi disappears and is found the following day looking faint and with strange bite marks on her neck. She eventually dies. Soon after, Natsuno starts feeling watched and starts feeling like maybe Megumi is still around... while the village doctor, Ozaki Toshio, blames her death - and the following ones - on some sort of strange epidemic until too much starts, eventually, being too much. And all those deaths have some sort of link to the Kirishiki household. So, what is happening, exactly?\\n\\n\r\nShiki brought back what true vampirism is. There is none of the romanticism nowadays associated with vampires. There is no forbidden love story. It's just a pure fight for the race's survival: human and vampire races, that is. The first episodes are a bit slow on the uptake, I admit, but from episode 13 on-wards it's a gore and thrill fest. It also focuses on a lot of interesting issues like who is the outsider in the end, why is it so terrible to fight for your own survival and it even adds some religion in the mix, personified by Muroi Seishin, son of the village Head Priest, who always felt trapped and in denial regarding succeeding his father.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBriefly: the artwork was a bit on the bad side and I must refer the hairstyles once again. The characters were really well written and I liked the brief flashbacks, specially Kirishiki Chizuru's - I ended up feeling a bit sorry for her. But the ones who shine the most are, obviously, Ozaki Toshio, the bad-ass doctor, Natsuno Yuuki, who fought evil from the inside, Kirishiki Sunako, the tortured woman forever trapped in a child's body and, I have to say this, Matou Tohru, who embodied the whole tragedy of being reborn into a life of murder without having a choice.\\n\\n\r\nIt all comes down to the whole good versus evil theme, in the end. What is considered good and what is considered evil? Like Atsushi-san's father said before attempting to strike down Sunako, he's got his morals and he was educated to distinguish what was good and what was evil and he used it as a justification for his actions. In this sense, we can say someone put it in his head and, due to the isolated environment he grew up in, he didn't feel the need to question it. But what's interesting is this: from the humans point of view, the vampires are evil because they kill their race mercilessly. But from the vampire point of view, the humans are the evil ones because they hunt down their race and empale them brutally, when the only thing they were trying to do was to survive: they don't want to kill humans, they have to. Humans don't have to kill vampires, in the other hand. They do because the moral code they grew up in tells them to: because vampires aren't creatures of God, because they're not from this world, because they attacked their loved ones. Either of these is understandable, I'm not taking sides. I just think Shiki brought an interesting perspective to the whole thing. Most heartbreaking of all was the whole \"I didn't ask to rise into this life\" issue.\\n\\n\r\nI give this show an 8/10. It's really, really good, probably the best of its season. I won't give it a 10 because I put the artwork in some consideration while ranking a show and this one didn't deliver much, although the gore scenes were really gruesome. And the ending wasn't satisfactory either: endings aren't supposed to raise more questions, like this one did. It was a true open-ending, and I don't like open-endings. The soundtrack is also amazing. Thrilling and heartbreaking.\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review.\r\nShiki....... at first glance some people may think that this is another Vampire Anime. Another tale of forbidden love or Revenge or maybe an unlikely Vamphero. What one is left with though after watching this Anime is a wonderfully told story that when you get right down to it, has very little to do with Vampires. What it is, is a very intelligent and creative plot that by it's end crosses into it's own genre about the walking dead. Be they Corpse or Living.  \r\nDespair, forsaken, Obligation, honor, pride, sin, Dread.... These are the terms I would use to conveywhat Shiki is about in a few words. Centered mostly around Toshio Ozaki, the head doctor at the hospital in Sotoba, and how he comforts the growing death count in the Village he believes is  his duty to protect. The methodical process that takes him from believing his village is under the influence of an epidermic to understanding that it is really under attack by demons, is the man attraction of this series. And his medically grounded approach only adds to the realism of the premise. His transformation very much reminded me of Dr. Tenma of Monster, becoming the man needed to stop the crisis at any cost.\\n\\n\r\nAlso you follow Natsuno, a high school aged boy who parents have decided to make a change to a slower paced life and against his wishes has moved from a big city to Sotoba. Very much feeling like an outsider, he resents the expectations that the \"community\" weighs it's residents down with.  The relationship between Sunako Kirishiki and Seishin Muroi round out the main focus of the series. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSet in a late 20th century rural Japanese Village Sotoba, in the midist of an August heat wave, you as the viewer are dropped into an idealistic small community where everybody knows your name. A Village that is surrounded by mountains and Fir trees, isolated from the world. A village that deals in death per the only export of town, caskets, and a village that has been surrounded by death ever since Kanemasa mansion, a European style Castle, was recently built.  \\n\\n\r\nThis back drop not only sets up the right conditions for the story to unfold but it also puts you in a state of timelessness. Almost like a dream, because there are no real amenities that make you say without a doubt the year is 199X. A feeling that is enforced by the chime like melodies that are played threw out the Show. La, La, La, La, Laaa.       \\n\\n\\n\r\nA true Romantic lives in the heart of Shiki. From the bright colors to the wild hair styles to the very fashionable clothes that some of the characters wear( looking at you Yasuyo  and your see threw nighty=) this is with out a doubt a very \"left brain\" creation of this town and it's people. It might turn off some people, but it shouldn't because it adds to the Day Dream surreal atmosphere. Do the Shiki really float away when they leave or are you in a daze. Even the Villagers are in some what of a day dream when they try to recall, \"hey those two young men look familiar\" as you see the unknown arms of said men wrapping around the forgetful villager. And much of this interpolation is left up to the viewer, as if you are being told a bed time story. Which I thought was excellent.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the series was great, because it took the norms and threw them out the window. It was serious yet very light hearted. The characters were engaging and they had depth, so much that the absent of some of the minor characters for a few episodes doesn't completely write them off in your \"don't care any more\" section of your brain. \\n\\n\r\nDon't expect a horror show, except a real hard look at life and how unfair it is for everybody under the sun.I would say it's a must watch for most.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate: 2/4/12\\n\r\nAfter watching this show again I just wanted to expand on two things. One being that this isn't really about Vampires. Yes that is the transition used to take the villagers from being in one group to another, but in my mind it could have been replaced with pretty much anything and held the same message. That the human condition is inescapable and not even shiki where immune. Out of many to choose from, I think the scene where the  Ookawa's meet summaries this thought completely. Not give too much way, but in death the son was weighted down with every bit of burden the his father put on him in life. The vampire was not glorified, explained or even on display for most of this series. Humanity is.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, there isn't anything that resembles a horror show in this series. Way too light heart when people are basically wasting away or when you actually get to see an attack on a human for blood. It was pretty much conveyed as being no big deal. By shows end, the scene where you see the house wives of the village covered blood and eating there lunches, tells you alot. Everybody does what they need to do to survive, not matter how ugly or grim. The story is truly more dreadfully than anything, meaning that it plays more viewers understanding of their relationships and social background. A child watches this show, knowing nothing of loneliness or trying to live up to expectations, or find a place in life and probably get's nothing out of the shows plot. \\n\\n\r\nReally a great show again. The ending is open, but if you have to leave a story with somethings left unanswered, this is the way you do it IMO. A short series, but it tells everything that needs to be told. I love this take on the undead/vampires, because it really makes look at when did this people turn into monster. And under the right circumstances would you prove to have already been dead inside from the this confine we call Modern society.",

            "content": "This series, in my eyes is a very cruel and painful masterpiece.\r\nIt touches pieces within you like nothing else. Pieces you'd rather have hidden for eternity. \r\nShiki revolves around a very basic question everyone encountered at one point. Many Animes have asked this question and dealt with it in their own way. However, \r\nnone of those I've watched can compare to how Shiki deals with it. \r\nShiki did not see it necessary to make this concept favourable in any way. \r\nYou are shown the truth, and only the truth, without cutting any corners, without making anything beautiful in order for us to grasp it better.\r\nAfair warning: This Anime is very cruel. Not in itself, not hidden behind the fourth wall. It will pierce your heart and thoughts using the medium called \"Anime\" like none other.\\n\\n\r\nTo start with the story, there's too much to say to put it into a simple review. You need to watch this anime in it's entirety to understand the story. Although it's simple in essence.\\n\r\nShikis Story grows a lot throughout the series. It is solid, it has no holes. It does not use some sort of complicated Plot Twists. You have your fair share of surprises and almost \\n\\n\r\nnothing in this Series is predictable. You can hope for certain outcomes, certain things but.. Most likely any of your hope will be crushed. Just like hope has been crushed for the \\n\\n\r\ncharacters in this Anime.\\n\r\nEvery damn character, however much unimportant he is, is still distinctive enough to tell them apart. And this Anime has a LOT of characters. To be precise supposedly 1300 ppl \\n\\n\r\nfrom one village. Of which around 50-100 have a storytelling purpose while every other character simply fills the masses. \\n\r\nYou do have Main Characters, but do not expect them to be how you want them to be. No character in this anime is truly righteous, truly pitiful, truly evil or truly important. Each \\n\\n\r\nand everyone of them goes through the mud, each and everyone of them baths in sunlight. \\n\r\nAnd although this Anime basically revolves around two fractions fighting one another, it is extremely hard to pick a side. It's not the purpose of this anime, to pick a side. It's \\n\\n\r\nsupposed to be that way. You watch and feel for both sides. You will get to know both of them. You will understand both. And all the more will both sides break your heart each and \\n\\n\r\nevery episode. \\n\r\nFollowed by greatly composed and fitting, heart wrecking music.. Scenery with unsettling atmospheres.. And a unique art style, this Anime is complete in itself.\\n\r\nYou may dislike the art style.. But it's still fitting the story like no other art style would. It's unrealistic yet immersive. It's comedic and tragic. It's beautiful and ugly all the same.\\n\r\nSo many Contradictions will cross your path, while watching. But all of them fit together and make sense.\\n\\n\r\nShiki with everything it has, will show you the ugliest side of humanity without cutting any edges.\\n\r\nThat's all there is to it. Nothing to justify it, nothing to make it harmless. Just the hard truth. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not flawless. But nothing in the world is. \\n\r\nDepending on what type of person you are, the time Axis might get a bit confusing.. But alltogether it doesn't even matter. Things happen at a time..\\n\\n\r\nPlease to watch this Anime if you are able to withstand the pain it will bring you. Please honor it with your unwavering gaze and attention. You can regret it after watching it. \\n",

            "content": "The problem with anime horror is that it doesn't really have the capacity to scare you mainly because the characters are not real people so it is very difficult to empathise with their situation.Saying that Shiki does a good job at being creepy with each episode finishing on a good cliff hanger, keeping you interested in the next episode.\r\nShiki also is a good example of reviews and spoilers as if you have read other reviews you will know what it is about which can ruin the first few episodes. That being said it is really hard to write a review without mentioning the V wordespecially as it is obvious from about the second episode even if it isn't to the characters so I'm  going to say it, VAMPIRES!!!!\\n\\n\r\nThere I said it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the story begins with a European style castle being built in the small village of Sotaba and when the residents move in Megumi Shimuzu, a girl with dreams of moving to the big city, goes missing later to be found in the woods and later dies. Soon after an apparent epidemic breaks out affecting Sotoba and the surrounding area leaving the local chain smoking doctor Toshio Ozaki at a loss, however, the dead begin to rise leading to the eventual bloody conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said knowing what is killing off the villages ruins the first few episodes and for me knowing something the characters don't feels frustrating but the Shiki doesn't help itself by making it obvious. Criticism aside Shiki is gripping. It hooks you and reels you in, keeps you interested and creates an environment where not even the main characters are safe. What makes Shiki stand out from other vampire horror though is that it gives the vampires a human side where they show fear and guilt while the humans show the opposite which poses several moral questions for the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast is large but Shiki concentrates on only a few which has to said are outstanding. I have mentioned Toshio the doctor, however, there is also the junior monk Seishin. the surly boy who moved form the city, on who Megumi had a crush, Natsuno, Natsuno's best friend Tohru and head vampire, in the form of a little girl, Sunako.\\n\\n\r\nLastly I must mention the outfits of Chizaru and Tatsumi. They basically look like their at a 70's disco night and provide most of the fan service which in Tatsumi's case is unusually fan service for girls.\\n\\n\r\nShiki is gripping, highly entertaining even thought provoking and well worth your time watching.",

            "content": "It's right to kill for survival? And what about killing for self-defense? Your answers about these questions will critically change your view of this anime.\r\n\"Oh, another vampire show\", when i remember saying this i want to kill myself now. This certainly isn't a generic vampire show, differing from usual shows that try to show the vampires as friendly-like creatures. Shiki, as it drags the viewer to actually be scared of them and it try to portray the vampires as they are intended to be, like real monsters.\r\nThe Story of this show isn't really unique, but wonderfully executed and makes the viewer try to solve themystery along side with our characters. It is about a small village called Sotoba, and mysterious deaths start to happen, and by the same time the strange Kirishiki family moves to a big castle on the hills. The story follows the path of our 4 main characters, each of them having their own depiction and try to do their own resolution that they believe is right, making decisions about and driving the plot to unexpected turns and twists. Shiki tries to show the psychological side of things, from multiple points of view and force the watchers to actually pick a side they believe it's right, which is very cool.\\n\\n\r\nDon't be turned off by the Art at first, certainly it isn't normal,  but after some time you just get used to it and to me actually ressembles a bit of CLAMP. Also, the air views from Sotoba village are beautiful and they really explore them, showing us various places of the village, especially the Kanemasa mansion. Giving us an eerie feel and helping us to figure out the mystery. The animation is quite fluid, the characters have strange poses but i think it's part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is simply outstanding. It's creepy, thrilling and haunting. We also have quiet tracks and sad pieces, they really contribute to the atmosphere.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was very good, i don't remember any flaws from the seiyuus, and all voices were good to hear.\\n\r\nThe first OP is fitting for the meaning of the anime, even some lyrics mean something if you compare to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters on the show are important for something on the story, sou you have to pay attention to everything they do to fully understand what is going on. As i said we have only 4 main characters here, Sunako, Toshio, Seishin and Natsuno and their choices are really important for the plot, the development of the characters is very good, the characters aren't dumb at all and even the supporting character contributes to the story. The characters are likeable and some of them really resembles real people.\\n\\n\r\nFor the enjoyment, it is a great show to watch, without regrets, the plot pregresses a bit slowly, but until the end you will already forget about the boring episodes, each of the episodes are thrilling and mystery packed. It stays true from start to end to vampires' roots (they actually burn in the sun) and if you expect something like twillight, this is not what you're looking for. I really recommend Shiki.\\n",

            "content": "The reason I've decided to to write this review is that I don't think Shiki has seen enough recognition. Too many times have I made mention of Shiki and received blank stares. Additionally, because it is not as recognized as others, it is not as easy to research when deciding whether or not to watch it. This is a habit I've picked up over the years and it frustrates me to no end when I cannot find the information I desire without spoilers. And so, without further ado, the review.\r\nGoing into Shiki, I did not really know anything about it nor did I expect much.Without giving much away, I will say this: It blew me away. The Storyline is nothing entirely original, mysterious family moves into a rural town and the population of the town starts dropping. Having said that, the idea is not terribly common and it was presented very well. Coming from a variety of different perspectives, it offered a different approach to what was going on at any given point of the anime. This does not simply mean different people, we're talking social, medical, religious. Shiki offered it all.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was...different. Coming from someone that is extremely picky about what an anime looks like(not hesitating to drop an anime if it doesn't look pretty),I loved it. The character design was, in my narrow view, original, creative and interesting. Much like most anime, there was a definite style, or pattern that was adhered to. Angular, subtle lining made for an interesting watch and the subdued colours matched the setting and theme very well. Perhaps more importantly, they tended to match the mood of the current scene as well. This made the immersion all the more potent. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound(musically speaking) was also well thought out, fitting the theme and mood, adding to the immersion. Having said that, the voices(Japanese) could have been done a little better. At times I found it to be stunted, un authentic. Naturally, this varied from character to character and it was not so often or so bad that it made a large impact on viewing pleasure. But from time to time, it snagged my attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were, I feel, what made the anime come alive. The growth and development of each one, their hopes, desires and dreams all fell into a relatable and understandable category, bringing the viewer to care for them without even realizing it. Truth be told, it was a complete shock to feel so hurt on behalf of a character without seeing it coming beforehand. Until that point, I had thought that it wouldn't really bring anything out of me if something bad were to happen. Even the \"antagonists\" each had something that drew me to them, and all in all every situation was reacted to in a manner that I could see happening in real life. From my point of view, that's a big plus. While it may not be listed as such, I really found it interesting to watch the psych of each character as the anime developed. Be it negative or positive, each character had their own method of coping and dealing with everything that happened. I'd suggest keeping an eye out for that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I found Shiki to be thoroughly enjoyable. It may not have been the biggest rollercoaster ride of emotions, but it certainly brought more to the table than I had expected and it kept it's quality high throughout the anime.",

Good stories will always do this, where you are unable to distinguish what side your're on! Shiki really focused on human nature and its inability to be fully/wholly logical beings. In built predjudices to the diffrent/unfamiliar and explores ethical reasoning for murder/killing. \r\nI found that for me there was an psychological and philosophical theme/focus in the storyline which made it a darker more sinister anime. The simplicity of the shiki also was atriumph in my eyes as sometimes anime can go too far with supernatural beings, having outrageously unrealistic powers, which only serve a negative impact on the story in that its less believable. There is a very humanistic approach to the vampires in this anime, in that they really could exist in reality. its a very classic image of the vampire which for serious fans of Vampyr will love.",

            "content": "Shiki is a very interesting horror anime. It starts off a little slow, and the animation style takes a little getting used to (especially some of the odd clothes characters wear), but as it goes along it just keeps getting better and better.\r\nI personally, think this show has the best ending of any show I've watched. Not to spoil anything, but while it's not very happy, it just describes reality and humans very well. Shiki tells the story of a small town surrounded by mountains which a group of vampires move to. People in town start dying so quickly that they think it is anepidemic from an unknown cause. The people who die are sometimes brought back as vampires (called Shiki in this show). The end also gets very, very gory so don't watch this show if you can't stand blood, but that's to be expected of a horror anime.\\n\\n\r\nShiki is an interesting twist on the vampire genre. There's no sparkling in this, and unlike a lot of horror shows, it actually shows parts of the story from the \"antagonists'\" point of view. It makes you feel for both the humans and shiki. One thing to know about the characters is that this show has A LOT of them. Most of them are unimportant, but maybe 20 are still very important, though these characters, especially one of the two protagonists who is the doctor in the town, Toshio Ozaki, are very good characters.\\n\\n\r\nShiki is my favorite horror anime for it's great psychological analysis of how humans react in extreme situations and how desperate you can get whether you are human or not when you want to surivive.",

            "content": "Now, this is just my opinion. I'm not under the impression that my opinion is objective, so it's cool if you disagree. \r\nStory 9/10\r\nThe story doesn't sound like anything that impressive. A small village called Sotoba begins to have a ton of mysterious and unexplained deaths as soon as that family up at Kanemasa move in. \r\nNow, I think many people really underrate the story. It think it does SO many things right, and other Anime seem to lack the thematic impact and values that Shiki doesn't. \r\nWhat do I mean by that? Lets take a look at what Shiki sets out to do. First,it sets out to conjure mystery. If you haven't seen the reviews here, or read any synopsis', you would be hard pressed to even figure out that the Antagonistic force of the Anime are actually vampires until the bite marks show up. Their mechanics and temperament begin to slowly materialize to the viewers over time. It keeps the mystery drawn out while staying entertaining. I think that's admirable. Too many Anime and Visual Novels (looking at you, Umineko) reveal too much too soon.  \\n\\n\r\nWell, lets take a look at the Theme next. First, it's a question of what Survival means to you. As you progress and you see the main characters begin to get a clue, you get a look at how each of them react to the discovery of the Shiki. Do they go on a crusade? Do they remain neutral? Dare i ask, do they sympathize? \\n\r\nOf the Three main characters, each of them react completely differently thanks to the experiences they have gone through. It's a joy to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the question of what does it mean to be human? Where is the line between monster and human? At the beginning, the anime does a good job of coloring your view. As it progresses, you'll have to ask yourself once or twice, who are the monsters? By the end, that's all you'll ask. I'll say no more on the matter other than the Anime does a spectacular job on keeping things morally grey. There is a great deal of nuance. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nEh. Again, this is opinion, but I couldn't stand the art. For one, it was far too light toned. It looked like some Shoujo romance to me. But I also couldn't stand the hairstlyes. I mean... some of them were just ridiculous. Some of the humans were all out of whack. And some of the antagonist, looking at you blue haired dude with the dog ears, just looked extremely un-antagonistic. It was hard to be intimidated by some. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt had a view really good soundtracks, but by the end you'll have heard the same sad song that's used over and over again. At first, it's really powerful. I mean, it's a really riveting song. But it's overused. The rest of the soundtrack does it job well enough. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, I only really experienced the English Dub, and I have to say, it's pretty good. It's one of the few high quality English Dubs that may even rival the JP voices. There's one infamously horrifying scene in episode 20.5 that is almost unbearable to watch thanks to the high quality of the dub. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are a ton of characters in Shiki. \\n\\n\r\nI'll tell you this much, the main three characters (Natsuno, Toshio, and Seishin) were all quite good. They had inner demons, and each of them takes a different path in the situation simply due to their experiences. All of them develop amazingly, and, staying true the theme of the anime, it's hard to tell who is good and who is evil. \\n\\n\r\nThe major and supporting characters are quite one-dimensional. Unfortunately, some of them simply spend FAR too damn long on the screen for my liking. Even though they are annoying, however, if you look at what they actually DO, you'll probably be pretty impressed of what each of them represent. They further the theme. And that's why I can't bomb this rating, and why I love this Anime. I can't find a single character that doesn't represent something and play it out sufficiently. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nI couldn't turn it off. This may just be me, but I believe it's one of the most well-written Animes I've ever come across. It doesn't waste your time with unnecessary scenes, it doesn't throw a bunch of useless overused cliches at you. It keeps you hooked and does a great deal right. If they improved the art and the archetypal major characters that got on my nerves, I'd be pretty happy to place this in my top 5 Anime of all time. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nFind me an anime that does it's themes half as good as this anime does, and I'll shut up. It's a pretty entertaining Anime, and even early on it hits you in the feels. By the end, it will give you that slightly stunned feeling that keeps you thinking for a couple of days.",

            "content": "For my anime reviews I am going to review the anime on the order of which you would experience while watching an episode of the anime that is being reviewed.\r\n1.Art - At first when I watched this anime the art was to exotic in my opinion and I made a decision that it was bad.... that opinion soon changed.  I found myself being overwhelmed by the dark depiction of art and it turn out to be a good thing.  I also thoroughly enjoyed all of the character models because of how different they were from each other and I've gotta say, the hairin this show was over the top.  I enjoyed all of the art in this anime and it wasn't that it was the best art style, but I wasn't able to find anything that bothered me.  Since it's not the best but a very dark and beautiful art style I give art a 9.  Yes... I did like the hair. ; )\\n\\n\r\n2.Sound - Well..... wow.  The soundtrack for this anime blew me away.  It was appropriate for every scene in this show and it emitted the emotions of this anime flawlessly.  I will still be listening to this soundtrack a year from now and I will probably still love it.  It was perfect for me 10/10.\\n\\n\r\n3.Character - I can definitely say that this anime has very good characters and here is why.  Instead of saying they have a lack of back story I looked at the roles the characters play.  They each play a specific role that adds a different point of view in this anime and gives you a look of how the different people think.  It shows that people all have very deferent opinions and because of that I didn't really mind not having a lot of back story.  That being said, back story is a very important part of the character and that is why character only gets an 8.\\n\\n\r\n4.Story - Yes the story has problems with pacing but I didn't bother me, maybe i'm just a patient person.  Some people may not like it but even shows like Stiens Gate have pacing issues so stop fuckin' complaining about it.  Really..... just have patience it really pays off.  The story was very interesting to me in the way that it blurred the lines between bad and good.  Sometimes I could not tell what side the characters were on and the whole show questioned morality as we know it in society.  That interested me and I loved how the story did that.  I DID LIKE THE ENDING of coarse I can't give spoilers but I didn't have a problem with it.  I think it sufficiently answered it's own question of morality but because of those pesky pacing issues I give it an 8.\\n\\n\r\n5.Enjoyment - Have you ever felt forsaken..... well that is how this anime made me feel.  I felt reality melt away from me and I started to become immersed in the terrible, yet beautiful world of Shiki.  The characters struggles became my struggles and I believe that's how every anime should be.  Many people would think that this anime is support to be scary but honestly, I found my self more heart stricken then I did scared.  Part of the reason I loves this anime might be because I try to look on the bright side of things and when I did that I found this anime very worthy of my time.  I was surprised when I saw reviews for this anime and I think that every weeb should check this anime out.  I think that people see this anime in a way it's not suppose to be seen and I am very disappointed about that. For me, I am proud to say I enjoyed this anime 10/10!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is an overall 10.\\n\\n\r\n*I will also recommend that this anime is only watched by a matured audience.\\n\\n\r\nCaution:\\n\r\n!Keep in mind this anime has very intense gore.\\n\r\n!Keep in mind this anime has dark subject matter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "WARNING MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nI was really suprised with Shiki, when the anime started they introduced their first character, Shimizu Megumi. She was complaining about how much she hated the town and wanted to leave and we got to see the one she was in love with.\r\nThis beginning made me feel like we where heading down a Twilight-like road, but then the anime suprised me.\r\nMegumi who i assumed the main character in the beginning, died an early dead and then the real main character was introduced, Ozaki Toshio.\r\nToshio is an doctor who tries to help the town from what everyone thinks is an 'epidemic'. Slowly Toshiofinds out that there is something going on in the village and that an old legend may actually be an true one.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is told out of the view point of many different villagers and a lot of them even get some development. \\n\r\nThe most awesome aspect of the story is that later on you start to doubt about what is good and what is evil, if there even is something as good or evil in this story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art looks beautiful, its quite colorfull and detailed.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also quite good.\\n\r\nThe first OP is nice, especially in the last few seconds.\\n\r\nThe second Op is also good but isnt really in the Shiki-style\\n\r\nThe soundtracks fine, some good catchy music in which the music-box is especially good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are just so awesome.\\n\r\nNot only mayor, but also minor characters get an great development. Characters on both sides of the conflict are quite understandable and loveable.\\n\r\nIt's beatiful to see some Shiki suffer from their conscience.\\n\r\nThe only character that doesnt really make sense on any point at all is Shimizu Megumi, for some weird reason she doesnt care at all that she became a murderer and she even enjoys being a creature of darkness, there isn't given an good reason for it and i think it is just because the writer wanted an Yandere-like character in his story.\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment is really good with this show, after each episode you just want    more and before you know it a few hours have already passed.\\n\r\nThe special episodes are also worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i really liked Shiki, when i started i expected some lame teenager vampire love story, but it actually became one of the better anime around.\\n\r\nI give this anime an 9, and i recommend you guys check it out if you have the time!",

For one thing, I could never really watch Steins;Gate because of the coloring. It always gave me a headache, but Shiki really didn't.\r\n   I love all the plot twists and ect. Plus I really dolike the character developments. I really have no clue, but you may cry or show no emotions. Dunno, but I actually show know emotions in this anime. Which is actually weird... Whatever.\\n\\n\r\nI truly recommend this anime to people who likes watching horror animes. Not like Deadman Wonderland, but more like Blood-C.",

            "content": "Shiki originally came out during a time which vampire related media was on somewhat of an upswing content as a result of a certain novel/film series that was maligned by pretty much everyone who wasn't 13 or under female. It received much praise for going against the trend set by the accursed franchise by presenting a more classic take on vampire lore with an attempt to weave in some questions regarding the ethics of taking lives. That means premise-wise you can safely rest assured knowing at least what Shiki has to offer is more Salem's Lot with Higurashi vibes and less Vampire Knight or Twilight.\r\nThefirst half of the series makes for a very, very, slow burn as an \"epidemic\" begins sweeping through the small village of Sotoba located in the middle of bumfuck nowhere Japam. The answer to said epidemic is made very obvious by the 2nd episode, or even before the series if you already know the premise and it takes a long time before the characters pick up on it. As a result the 1st few episodes focus on clinic owner Dr. Toshio Ozaki and local priest Seishin Muroi's attempt to get to the root cause of the \"epidemic\" by going off on red herring trails that audience should already know are completely off. Meanwhile, characters on the side continue to die from anemia, while all sharing the same two slight punctures wounds next to each other. It takes about a third of the series for anyone to have the slightest idea as to what might really be going on.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the time early on is spent introducing characters. A lot of characters. Far too many characters. The enormous cast wasn't something struck me as a huge issue early on since I was hoping that this would lead to some interesting character arcs from at least some of them. Towards the end, it became extremely obvious just how much the show was overburdening itself. A lot of the individuals that become shiki (the term used to describe vampires in this series) end up being rather disappointing as characters as they cling to maybe one or two character traits from beginning to end. Characters that ought that seemed like they would contribute more only end up providing simple side stories and nothing the central story. If that wasn't enough a problem, for some of the human characters there are times in which a suspension of disbelief is necessary to make sense of what they do. Would anyone, for example, attempt to hunt vampires at night with only a couple of companions without telling anyone? Or better yet would anyone lightly bury an unconscious vampire with a few teaspoons of dirt and hope that someone else will find and deal with it before it can wake up? Dr. Ozaki is the easiest character to get behind, probably for being neither useless nor moronic. It honestly wouldn't be much a stretch to say that if Ozaki was removed from the series that the majority of the plot progression would leave with him. His method of dealing with the threat is as cold as it is pragmatic, but with no alternatives presented, I found him to be hard to disagree with.\\n\\n\r\nIronically, the thing I take issue with in Shiki was what I was most looking forward to seeing handled, that being it's themes. The way in which the script-writers attempted to shoe-horn the black and white conflict of the story into some moral quandary regarding \"who the true monster is\" is inherently problematic. For any conflict to wrap me into a moral grey area it has to convince of what good will come from either side coming out on top, and this is where Shiki fails miserably. From the beginning of the series to the end there was never any question from me that the shiki are a collective menace that ought to be curbed with one quick stake through the chest at a time. As much as the series tries to make you sympathize with the shiki, the simple fact they must prey on and kill humans just to survive puts them in the wrong. This could have worked if the whole idea of coexistence between the two sides was looked into properly, yet the series never really explains why they have to kill. Shouldn't sucking non-lethal amounts of blood be enough? It gets even worse when you consider what would happen should the shiki be allowed to continue to do as they do. More and more shiki would arise and eventually and the death toll would rise until there aren't any more people to kill. Then what would they sustain themselves with? It kind of makes the plan to make the village a den of bloodsuckers seem ridiculous once you consider how that might actually play out. The attempts to humanize the shiki in the last 3rd feel a bit some of them easy feel sympathy for (particularly the Goth loli Sunako and one of the side characters featured in the 1st of the 2 episode specials) but at no point was I convinced that the retaliation at the hands of people was wrong. All the shiki do for the majority of the story is attack people so they can selfishly continue their crappy lives. That said the massive pity party thrown for them in the final episodes does not at all ring true. There's also unnecessary references to the tale of Cain and Abel to demonstrate the show's central idea regarding the loss of humanity or something that came off as rather heavy-handed. To the show's credit I will say that it was nice that cliched PETA logic was never invoked to take the humans off of their moral high ground as if to say the lives of people are equal to those of livestock. Now that would have sucked.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the audio/visual merits there's one aspect that screams to be addressed, which of course means this is the part where I address frilly haired elephant in the room, the silly character designs. One can only assume that a good deal of the characters must have had their hair done by lobotomized hairstylists as the end result is rather hideous. Hair motion is noticeably absent as well so the wacky hairdos of the characters just seem to hang in place as if they are wearing strangely sculpted papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 hats. Not only that but their bodies kind of have CLAMP's signature slim and gangling look, with chins about that look sharp enough to jab vampires through the heart. Designs aside the rest of the production soundly nails the kind of eerie vibe needed for this type of series. The visuals do what they can to convey dread and uncertainty with fantastically drawn night time background shots and visual effects. Glimmering red eyes being used to denote mysterious evil is not a novel idea by any stretch of the imagination, but tiny dots of red light to signify a nocturnal predator is nearby works nonetheless. This is anime that knows how to imprint lasting images into the minds of its audience with rather disgusting imagery, like burning flesh, bubbling and spurting blood from being impaled with a stake. Shiki can be a rather messy title, so be prepared to wince at least a couple of times once the violence begins to pile on. The OST isn't likely the type one would seek to listen to on its own (besides maybe the openers, between which I happen to vastly prefer the 1st). Music selection overall runs the full gamut of \"spooky sounds\" from the dissonant sounds and ensemble chants, and even some downer melodies to convey the heartbreak of losing loved ones. The seiyuu work for Shiki can be notably over the top, which works in well considering how extreme emotions often run high throughout the story. The more simplistic characters tend to have more exaggerated voices like the wimpy Masao, or the shrill and vain Megumi. Mood swings are deftly handled with the stand out being Haruka Nagashima as Kaori who exhibits the perfect range of fear/sadness to rage/terror needed for the role.\\n\\n\r\nAs nicely as it was directed, to me the series overall came off as overly bloated with unimportant characters either doing nothing of interest or killing each other. I understand the point of of the enormous cast was to show the effects of mass hysteria and culturally based delusions on a universal level, it came at the high cost of having interesting individuals. All whilst being tied together with some weak rhetorical argument that assumes moral equivalence between two sides when there isn't any. It might work a bit better if for those willing to let appeals to emotion overtake logic. A series like this ought to leave its viewers emotionally eviscerated by the end, so it's a shame that I came out the experience as cold as I did. I still recommend watching this series all things considered. As much as I found the series hard to agree with in the end, I can't accuse it of not being thought provoking on at least some level.",

            "content": "beginning note:  I'm not a review person really, but seeing how so many people wrote lame things in their reviews about Shiki I just had to write something. Really,most of the reviews that have small scores are saying that the plot is not original and it's Higurashi rip-off. Well if you're asking me, those people haven't really seen the show, and the Higurashi rip-off proves it -_-'\r\noh and there are small spoilers so if you don't like spoilers be sure ti finish Shiki before reading this review.\r\nStory 9:\r\nI personally love it. At first I was lost with all those deaths but soon after thatthe mystery started to reveal to me. I find Shiki very similar to Stephen King's Salem's Lot. That is the only place where I've seen some real  vampire  action  before, and that's why I give the story 9 of 10. I'd say that compared to Salem's Lot, Shiki is much more deeper and emotional. Those who have seen Shiki and really understand it, will see my point. The first part is about all those creatures in the night but somewhere near the end, we have the villagers drown in fear,and when human is afraid, it can be more scary than any vampire out there, I really love the fact that human ugliness and darkness are shown in the story. Yeah we have Vampires, but they don't kill of pleasure, they kill because they need to feed themselves, they kill because they want to make the village their base where they can live isolated..basically they kill for survival. Humans on the other hand, when they'll find out the truth will decide to defend the village, and that's ok so far 'cause it's logical...but we do have scenes where actually people start going crazy and even start killing human beings....like I said ugliness and darkness of human mind.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 9:\\n\\n\r\nThe art was different compared with other anime I've seen,and I love different kind of art. The only thing that bothered me were some crazy hairstyles which were disgusting and didn't fit with the story IMO -_-' I was satisfied with the effects. I mean this is not a magical genre so don't expect something shiny or dunno swords of light, or this is not a paranormal thing so there are no ghosts that will shine around...I guess it all depends from which point of view you'll see it. For a Vampire anime, with lots of deaths, in everyday village,  I find it perfect.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 10:\\n\\n\r\nI love Shiki OST. The music in the anime was awesome. It gave scary and sad feeling, which is perfect for this kind of anime. The openings were really fun to watch...I mean you don't see so much people in one horror opening like you do in Shiki XD also ahh the dark feeling of the 1st opening, it was really enjoyable. At first I didn't like the 2nd opening, don't get me wrong but my ears were bleeding :D but I got used to it and now I'm loving it. Ending songs were cool as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10:\\n\\n\r\nI must say that Shiki surprised me. There are so many characters in the opening, so it was something to be expected, but usually there are more supporting characters and the story is focused more on the main characters when we see that many people in the opening. Shiki is not one of those stories. \\n\r\nEvery character that was shown in the anime was  clearly defined, which made the story more enjoyable. Yes we have two main protagonists, but in the anime it's not all about them.It's all about the village and people that are living in it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10:\\n\\n\r\nWell not many anime can hold me down to my chair and make me watch them like crazy. I was hooked on Shiki from the 1st moment. I'm a mystery/horror lover so this was like a joke to me, since usually those type of genre in the movie/anime world are really lame and not very original. So I did a little research and find out that Ghost Hunt and Shiki have the same creator Ono Fuyumi and I thought WOW :)) They are both so different but really awesome and intelligent stories.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10:\\n\\n\r\nI don't  have a heart to give it anything smaller than that. Shiki is awesome story that deserves no less. If you love a great mystery and intelligent horror story (Ghost Hunt, Ghost Hound  etc.), that actually is logical you should definitely try it. But don't try it if you are a blinded Higurashi fan..I mean I do love Higurashi but the only word that I'll ever use to describe it it'll be the word \"SICK\".  Don't get me wrong but when it comes to real mystery/horror masterpiece Shiki wins all the way.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~ helpful or not helpful,I really don't care. I'd probably be attacked by Higurashi fans lol :D But nooo they can't hide the truth from the real mystery lovers ;)",

            "content": "Alright this is my first review.\r\nI would first like to say that I had different expectations from Shiki. I started watching this anime knowing nothing more than the sypnosis written, and was expecting epic guns-blazing demon-exorcising action. But I did not get any of that. The first few episodes dissapointed me as there is literally no action going on, and then it soon dawned upon me that this is a dark mystery genre of anime.\r\nShiki starts out slowly(snail's pace until episode 7 or so) and the first few episodes were almost identical to me. There was nothing exciting going on other than the mysterious deathsthat happen frequently. Just when i was about to give up...BAM the anime starts heating up and I was suddenly pulled into the distorted world of Shiki.\\n\\n\r\nI think that this is a very unique anime and is unlike other vampire animes I have seen. It focuses more on the human emotion and ethicity, from both the humans and the Shikis side. Should I kill others to survive myself? Is killing humans a sin as a Shiki? Can I ever enjoy a pink-frosted chuncky chocolate donut? Yes, serious dilemmas surfaces and it is just interesing to see what horrible choices the characters 'chooses'. I found myself constantly associating Shiki with Higurashi, due to the smiliar setting and the genre of dark mystery and gore. Though I don't think it compares to Higurashi, it certainly holds its own charms.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nNow I wouldn't say that the story is amazingly original, because I'm sure we have all seen such scenarios where a isolated village gets terrorised by monsters. However, what differs this from other typical storyline are the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\n The regular Shiki, or vampire or walking dead are not like the ones we see in movies. They don't mindlessly feed on humans. Instead, they have the exact same personality and emotion when they were human and this is transfered to the Shiki persona, which is what makes Shiki interesting. Honestly, I cannot give a damn to most human characters. They just strike me as boring, with the exception of the doctor. The real main characters, in my opinion, are the Shikis as the portrayal of the Shikis bring life to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\n Just stunningly beautiful, and when the main hero Yuuki looks like the same hero from a Shonen Ai manga, you know the art is good. Just kidding, but seriously, the village is very detailed and the lighting in the day and the night differs tremendously, displaying different moods so you can really be absorbed into the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nTo be honest, I was not really paying attention to the background music, and the OPs and EDs aren't exactly my type of music, but i guess the use of silence to create suspense is pretty masterful in this anime\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\n HELL YEA-...well I guess I enjoyed it mostly even though the ending is a cliffhanger and it makes me mad that they did not give a proper ending to satusfy the viewers. Even though Specials Episodes were made, it only serves to explain certain events, but not all, and I feel a little bit cheated out of the experience. However, I did enjoy all the suspense created and the good ol' bloodfest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8\\n\r\nShiki is the kind of anime you would watch for five minutes and wonder \"Did that just seriously happen? It delivers all its 'messages' well and at the end of the anime, you will feel that you have learnt something and come to understand the drastic changes in almost all the characters. And I just like a good gorefest and Shiki gives it to me rather excessively.Everything is refined and leaves the viewers wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you think you can stomach some blood,(who am I kidding, I'm talking tons of blood, heck I wouldn't be surprise if the amount of blood fills a swimming pool) and just loves mystery and suspense genre of anime with beautiful art, then watch Shiki. If you can withstand its slow takeoff,you will find yourself immersed in the world of Shiki in no time. \\n\\n\r\nWarning: If you had just watched a straight-up full-blown comedy like Gintama or Baka to Test, DO NOT watch Shiki. You may not handle the rough transition from laughs to screams. Well,enjoy it anyway :)",

This is that type of show where after last episode you start thinking: Who is the real monter in this world?\r\nI've heared about this show from my friend he said \"Hey, you like dark anime, right? Try Shiki you'll like it\". I decided to start watching it at 6 p.m., I finished it at 4 a.m. the same day and i didn't regret single minute spent with this anime.\r\nI found the story be kind of slow paced in the begining but this changed after few first episodes. It turned out to be magnificent story with lots of secrets and situations when after each episodeyou stare at your screen and ask yoursef \"What did I just watch?\". \\n\\n\r\n However story is not everything in this show. When I've heared music in this anime for the first time I was amused. Every time music started playing I had chills going down my spine. Each and every track was just perfect and made this show even darker and sadder.\\n\\n\r\nShiki is not simple horror story. This is story where is no good nor bad side. This is sorrowful story about fight for survival in world full of monsters. \"But who are these monsters?\" you may ask. This is the question which you need answer to yourself when you finish this incredible show. However believe me...\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, true monsters don't have long claws and sharp teeth...\\n",

            "content": "Well, in a year full of Twilight and Vampire Diaries hypes and other crappy vampire stories, Shiki comes as a refreshing drink. That's how a vampire story has to be. The feeling of suspense and horror, deaths and plot twists. If you can't have this in a vampire story than it's not vampires you're dealing with. It's just some shiny guy with fangs.\r\nThe story of Shiki is absolutely outstanding. Full of plot twists, heart racing revelations and it gets to a point where you're not absolutely sure which side to support, vampires or humans. While the first half of the anime is for story andsuspense development, the second half focuses on the war between the two species.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing as well. The sceneries are well detailed, the characters are really well drawn and it always enhances the feelings that are supposed to be conveyed.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, as the art, never fails to help enhancing the atmosphere. Takanashi Yasuharu had already done a great job in Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror and in Jigoku Shoujo, among others, and showed his skills once again in this amazing anime.\\n\\n\r\nPossibly the strongest point in this series, the character development is unique. Vampires or humans, all of them are deep and act accordingly to what could be expected in the situation they are. Some will often make you have twisted feelings towards them.\\n\\n\r\nWith so many great aspects this is by far and large the best show in 2010. I enjoyed watching until the very last episode and hopefully there'll be a second season.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you're looking for suspense and vampiries, look no more. Shiki is the one!;D",

            "content": "Every once in awhile a show comes along and redefines a genre.  Sometimes this is accomplished by telling an exceptional story; sometimes it's done by bringing a fresh and thought-provoking perspective to an otherwise familiar tale.  In Shiki's case, it's a bit of both: by providing a unique rendition of the classic tale of a village overrun by vampires while simultaneously offering a distinctly philosophical take on the vampire legend, the series manages to breathe new life into the oversaturated and generally monotonous vampire genre, and in so doing establishes itself as an instant classic.\r\nShiki starts with a common premise. During an especiallyhot summer in the small and isolated village of Sotoba, a string of unusual deaths occur just as the strange Kirishiki family moves into the old Kanemasa mansion on the outskirts of town.  Although the villagers believe a summer cold is going around, the viewer quickly discovers the real cause: the Kirishiki are vampires (okiagari, or \"corpse demons\" to be precise), and they've decided to make Sotoba their home.  This, of course, means killing every last villager.  Yet rather than simply glossing over this point and focusing on one or two main characters to the exclusion of others, Shiki details the okiagari's systematic takeover of the village by acquainting us with each villager and their family and then making us sit through their demise.  This has the nice effect of making it easier to care about the villagers' losses and the difficult choices they must make, particularly when the dearly departed come knocking on the door, or when the dead must decide whether to attack their loved ones in order to survive.  The one downside to this method is that the story sometimes feels slow and drawn out, especially on replay.\\n\\n\r\nIf the show does have main characters, they are undoubtedly Toshio Ozaki, the village physician, and Seishin Muroi, the village priest, whose diametric views on the nature and deserts of the okiagari are representative of the village as a whole.  As the village physician, Ozaki approaches the series of deaths from a medical perspective, and when he discovers the okiagari's existence and that it is \"kill or be killed,\" he doesn't hesitate to fight back in order to save the living.  By contrast, the religious Muroi is troubled to the point of inaction by the fact that the okiagari are essentially human and only feed upon the living in order to avoid an unbearably painful hunger followed by death.  His interactions with the kind and tragic Sunako Kirishiki lead him to question not only whether the okiagari's actions are truly murder, but also whether the notion of sin applies at all to those forsaken by God.  Whereas Ozaki sees murderers deserving punishment, Muroi asks why such beings exist in the first place, and whether there can be murder without an uncoerced intent to kill.  These constrasting perspectives are revisited throughout the story in the experiences of the individual villagers, who must choose whether to kill the okiagari (often family members), and in the experiences of the okiagari, who struggle with the morality of their actions. \\n\\n\r\nShiki's other major element is psychological, displayed through the villagers' unwavering denial of the spiritual and their gradual evolution in thought and response.  This aspect of the show is not only original, but also refreshingly realistic in its portrayal of resistance to belief in the supernatural.  Even as the facts begin to pile up, the villagers search for any explanation other than \"mere superstition\" and refuse to believe what is happening.  Yet paradoxically, while clinging to science and rationalism their actions are also guided by a base fear of the worst, so that even late in the series when most still dismiss fears of the okiagari as backward we find virtually no one willing to walk the streets at night (when the legend says the okiagari come out to kill).\\n\\n\r\n In addition to Ozaki, Muroi, and Sunako, the show features a large cast, many of whom are well-developed and fun to watch.  Notable among these are 15 year-old Natsuno Yuuki, arguably a secondary main character alongside Sunako; Megumi Shimizu, Natsuno's stalker classmater; Tatsumi, the Kirishiki's main servant, and Chizuru and Seishirou Kirishiki, the purported heads of the household.  Generally the characters are very nicely animated (some, like Natsuno and Ozaki, reminded me fondly of Code Geass) and many have highly original, love-it-or-hate-it hairstyles and eye designs.  The background animation also really shines with detailed, scenic shots and some very cool experimental scenes.  On the downside a couple of character designs are confusingly similar, most notably Seishirou and the man who visits Sunako in the past.  The soundtrack, while a bit limited and repetitious (many of the tracks are simple variations on the main theme), is definitely one of the better and more memorable ones I've heard, and it fits the dark/horror/slightly lighthearted mood of the show quite well.  Shi-ki in particular captures perfectly the story's sense of sadness, moral ambiguity, and despair.  The voice cast is generally excellent, with special praise to Cherami Leigh as the sad yet determined Sunako.  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all Shiki is superb, offering a well-produced, original, and highly provocative take on the vampire legend.  Perhaps most surprisingly, it turned out to be one of the most philosophical anime I've seen.  Hopefully in time Shiki's unique take on the nature and deserts of the vampire will have an impact far beyond anime.  In the meantime, I encourage everyone to check it out.",

            "content": "This is my first review XD. I watch a lot of anime but I feel that Shiki deserves a higher rating because of it's wonderful storytelling.\r\nStory:\r\nFinally, an anime about the brutality of vampires, they are not just sparkly beings who you'd want as a boyfriend (-___-'). The romanticism of vampires (i.e. Vampire Knight, Night Walker, Vampire Hunter:BL, etc...) although good (I still love romantic vampires) just fantasizes the idea of seduction and pleasure. Of course they have supernatural powers and charisma so they are often shown fighting forces of greater evil (a more evil vampire or other demonic creatures) as part of the actiongenre. They gloss over what it is to be an actual vampire (I guess because producers assume you already know what a vampire is).\\n\\n\r\nAfter all the lovey dovey, fighting evil/crime... I find Shiki to be the most refreshing vampire anime I ever watched.\\n\\n\r\nShiki brings you back to the basics. It is an anime about the existence of vampires itself. It brings to light what you already know about vampires and thus a midwife's tale becomes reality in a small rural town far away from modern society. Emotions ranging from disbelief to acceptance from the villagers are portrayed. When a Shiki bites your neck, s/he will continue to do so until you're dead. You see the deterioration of health, gaunt faces, pallor, and eventual death of the victim. I also like how medical terminology are used to describe various conditions and symptoms of the patient. You see fear and hear screams of desperation. You see that Shiki burns when they are in contact with sunlight, something that I think most vampire anime avoids. You see how the only way to kill them is to sever a major blood supply to the brain or heart. You see their fear of religion and that one cannot enter unless invited. You see that it also about survival. The choices are: 1) you die 2) you rise 3) you rise and need blood 4) you rise and refuse blood 5) you fight back 6) you rise and you fight back...there may be more but I listed what came to my mind first.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also about morals. What do you when you find out that your town is slowly being replaced with the undead? Do you return back to your family? Will they accept you? I want them to come to this side so I kill them with the hope that I'll have someone to be with. I don't want to be shunned by society...Shiki still retains their human personality, thoughts, and emotion. This is why I feel like Shiki has a lot of dimension.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I thought the hair was weird at first but I got use to it. It's kind of interesting how gravity defying it is and how oddly clumped they are >___",

            "content": "Warning: this review contains spoilers.\r\nFirst impressions: Before i got into this show, I\u2019d heard it was one of the best horror anime ever to come out of the anime medium. Not only that, but and it has a lot of thematic depth and grey morality and hearing that kinda got me interested. It's about a small town and there odd things going down with people dying by a mysterious sickness and there apparently sighting of the recently departed hanging around town at night.\r\nStory,5/10\r\nDuring a normal summer in the small rural town named Sotoba, all seems well. But after this new family has moved in therehas been Theses case of mysterious deaths that have  Been happening in the village With people dropping like flies. the local doctor Toshio is trying his best to find the root cause of these deaths with the help of his best friend the local monk named Seishin While there investigating.  Local City boy Natsuno Yuuki has this  feeling that someone is watching him  after the mysterious death of his best friend toru  and his local stalker Megumi. So are these deaths caused by some mysterious virus or is something more sinister afoot. Well spoiler alert it's actually vampires.  So to start off there is a general consensus in quite a few circles that anime and horror don't really mix well and feel that Shiki is no exception to that mindset, because even if it's a more realistic take on vampires in a modern setting. I wasn't really scared and the only reason I kept watching was that  I felt was a small case of morbid curiosity to see where the story would go. Because at face value it has quite a bit going for it theme-wise as it talks about survival, criticisms of human society and the evils of humanity. Which honestly has been done to death already at this point in time and done better but I digress. Now I feel that Shiki does a great job of building up its story the first few episodes of Shiki are probably some of the best episodes setup wise and when I first originally watched this show I had this feeling of  morbid curiosity as I wondered what was going to happen next, and shiki does a very good at pulling you in and getting you intrigued in a similar vein to Higurashi where you don't really know what's happening  and your just along for the ride.\\n\r\nNow when it comes to the conflict between the humans and the Shiki which is the main focus, I feel from a collectivist standpoint both sides are pretty much as bad as each other in my viewpoint of morality, ethics and etc. \\n\r\nBut from an individual  standpoint i would say certain characters are more justified in their actions and behavior  than others, because most of the people in this village are to put it nicely are  assholes during life and during unlife. one of the villagers who becomes a shiki is actually a pedophhie who exclusively targets little boys and one villager who is so xenophobic towards outsiders to such a degree that she would even  make  the ku klux klan seem tolerant by comparison, so none of these people is innocent or clean as some  people may think and it kinda  takes away the moral ambiguity of the conflict as human/shiki seem to use this conflict  to justfly there inhuman acts towards each over.  Which causes the major underlying issues that I have with Shiki is that it tries to play off as an emotional series with deep themes to make it seem mature. but handling wise it's anything but, because it pretty much  plays out like a slice of life/ soap opera  with vampires and it not like I am against  this more emotional driven narrative but the problem is it doesn't really work past a gimmick, when they try to expand upon the story  you start seeing these big holes in logic, which evidently makes me not care about what happens.\\n\r\nLike to list a few examples of things not making sense, One of main themes of shiki is survival  and the reason i bring this up is It was established that Shiki take at least a cup worth of blood per feeding until the person dies or becomes a shiki. yet why didn't the shiki just cycle through different people in rotation, because if your a shiki who doesn't want to kill humans  then surely that's a more efficient way of survive with the added bonus of not having an angry mob after you. Because what's the worst  that could happen? cases of mild anaemia popping up at random. \\n\r\nwhen I think about that's it kinda makes the grey morality conflict kinda Null and void and any drama that comes from it now feels forced and to make it worse. I have seen people trying to defend it by saying the shiki had no choice and the humans are truly evil for trying to defend themselves against the bloodsucking undead that will suck them dry.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example is the main villains the Kirishiki  goal of making a vampire village so that shiki can have a home and not have to worry about humans, that all well and good but my question is how exactly  is this vampire village going to work exactly if they don't have any blood. I know that people will say they can just kidnap people from other towns, But people will notice. For the basic reason, that soba doesn't the ecosystem to support such a village in the long run and to prove my point sotaba was a village with give or take 300 people and when the local shiki set up shop  in the span of a few months they reduced the local population by half With an attrition rate like that  they would have a better chance of making a vampire ghetto in a city than a  village in the countryside. \\n\r\nAlso even though they wanted to make this vampire village they seem to be doing things that are very counterproductive. because it's also established that Shiki can mind control anyone they have bitten, so why didn't the shiki just bite everyone and then mind control people to do what they want. Which is  more safer and easier than killing people to build up this undead population. Because having a bunch of the undead running around at night is totally not suspicious at all?\\n\\n\r\nThe other little nitpicks i have is that this series, is that I wish it had more episodes because there are actually scenes that were cut out from this series and to add insult to injury the scenes that were cut out had a lot of background details. which takes away from the experience as a whole and makes it seems hollow. \\n\r\nI also feel that shiki supernatural elements are poorly defined as a result and also the fact the original source material never expanded upon it, like what makes a person rise up as a shiki or in some cases transform into super vampires with cheat mode enabled. The only thing we know about shiki is that they defy medical science along with other laws of nature and that only the special snowflake people get to rise up or if you're super special snowflake transform. Which translates to plot convince and plot holes as the definition of special is very vague and allows anything to happen. \\n\r\nIt would have nice been if they had said that humans with certain personality traits, morals and life philosophies that aren't common or strays from the norm have a higher chance of becoming a Shiki because of X and Y reasons. That's would be more grounded and it also makes you think what kind of person are these characters really underneath all the surface level social interactions and obligations, but no we couldn't have depth or good writing. when you take away the creep factor and the horror element this series dose feel like twilight the animation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nThere are three Main Characters in this series, so I\u2019m going to talk about each of them separately, rather than as a group. First main character, Natsuno Yuuki is this emo/loner teenager with a heart of gold, something I initially found slightly interesting and out of the main cast I could relate to him the most in some ways, but which disappointed me all the more, when he turned out to be, by far the weakest link out of all the series\u2019 mains. Even though he\u2019s most certainly better written than your usual highschool protagonist, outside of that, he isn't really that interesting, because of his lackluster handling. To add insult to injury, after 11 episode they kinda drop the ball on him and don\u2019t give him the screen time he deserves afterwards, even though he continues throughout the story to play a big role. it like they didn't know what to do with his character so they decided to push him to the sidelines and also out of the main characters he is the one that gets the least development and fleshing out. he pretty much treated like background character after a certain point and I didn't really like it. Considering he had some potential because of what type of person he is and what happens to him in the series. but in practice, this potential wasn't fully realized.\\n\\n\r\nSecond main character Toshio Ozaki Who is very determined and serious about this job as the local doctor, as he will go through whatever it takes to make sure his patients are safe and healthy.  even if he sometimes he comes of as rough around the edges And throughout the events of the series he goes through so much pain and turmoil because for once in his life he doesn't have the answers and he can't do anything to stop these mysterious deaths and the vampires behind it. In fact his inability to stop these mysterious deaths pushes  him to the braking point of where the lines of human/inhuman really start to blur for him as a person Which was very interesting and asks the question for his character how far is he willing to go to protect  the villagers at the cost of his own humanity. Which he learns the hard way and has to live with his actions for the rest of his days as he almost loses everything in his blind pursuit  of justice which I find quite funny in a  very tragic and  ironic way because a doctor duty was to protect and save lives but now you have a doctor who is now destroying and taking  the (un)lives of the former villagers he once tried to protect.\\n\\n\r\nNow the last main character seishin  Muroi who is the local priest and on off writer in the village. Who on outside seems like a pretty calm and well-natured guy basically he like the total opposite of the dr Ozaki. but underneath this calm exterior lies  is a very deep rooted hatred for the village that has made him and his father life miserable because of the roles there were assigned to in their local community without any choice or anyway to escape from it and he also a person with a very bleak outlook on life which was created by his environment,Which probably makes him one of the more interesting characters in the series and also goes through some pretty nice development and fleshing out which was pushed along with his friendship with Sunako, who is probably one of few individuals that truly understands him . This relationship and the dr actions  eventually leads to him having an a ultimatum forced upon him, He can give up his morals and  save the village that he Hates or keep to his morals and pursue his only chance at freedom. Of course I am not going to tell you what choice he picked but his inner conflict to reach a conclusion was very interesting to watch and also does well from a thematic standpoint as one of the series other themes is how human society places roles on people and expect people to stick to those roles whether you want to or not. \\n\\n\r\nSo when it comes to side characters. I feel this series sufferers from the same issue that Tokyo ghoul had where they have a lot of characters with personalities and etc  but not enough time is focused on them for character fleshing out or character development, and it doesn't really help when most of the supporting cast feels very distant and it hard to feel invested emotionally,especially when the horror element of the series is banking so much for you to care about these characters. why should i feel bad or care about characters that i don't really know.  the only few characters i cared about was toru who becomes consumed  with guilt after murdering his best friend who tried to help him or Ritsuko the local nurse who  goes out of  her way not to feed on anyone because she would rather die than willingly  bring harm others so she could live and these characters are the most human and some of the more realistic characters in the series. But the other shiki didn't really consider the consequences of their actions until it was to late, like for example Megumi  who like many of the characters  were strong armed into becoming shiki yet she takes the whole vampire thing way too far. Like I understand that she has to drink blood to live and she kinda a bitch but does she really need to start enjoy killing people which also included her former loved ones  like some demented sadist.  I understand there was more introspection in the original source for her character, but it sure as hell isn't in this anime and I think it was quite needed. It would have been interesting to see considering what she becomes. Because there still things she cares about like her one-sided love/obsession with Natsuno, which showcases she's isn't just a heartless monster she just kinda a bitch.\\n\\n\r\nLast thing I want to talk about is the kinda the main villain Sunako. Who isn't exactly evil per say she more like an anti-villain because nothing in her personality or actions really scream evil to me.The goal of having a vampire village so her kind could have a place to call home and not be threatened by humans is quite a noble goal and I am pretty sure lots of  people would do the same if being put in her shoes and the humanity still with her is more fleshed out with her relationship and interaction with seishin. But the problem is that even though she lived for about 100+ she has the mental capacity and foresight of a small child and doesn't really understand what exactly she putting people through to reach those goals she\u2019s similar to Peter Pan in  that respect because she the girl that never truly grew up, And That's her character in a nutshell. she doesn't truly understand or feel anything for the victims of her actions because at this point her psychology is so alien and disconnected from humanity. but what I dislike is how they're trying to make her overly cute to make her seem more innocent than she actually is and It almost feels at times that they're trying to manipulate your emotions, When It comes to her character as a whole with this very dishonest presentation of her character.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7/10\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty decent and maintains a very consistent level of quality. Unfortunately, the backgrounds that match it leave a lot to be desired. One of the series\u2019 greatest strengths is the way it occasionally changes the color scheme for certain scenes of tension to create an atmosphere that benefits them. This is by far the most effective visual element the show implements, as it adds a lot more energy to the series as a whole, which also helps you get through some of the slower parts. The artstyle is fine, but I think it's a bit too cartoony and over the top at times with the character\u2019s expressions, which conflicts with the series\u2019 dark and ominous tone. The artstyle\u2019s greatest sin though is in the character designs. While not bad on their own, they\u2019re probably the worst thing they could\u2019ve picked for this show. I mean neon pink hair, purple eyes and hairstyles that look straight out of the 80s aren\u2019t exactly the best thing for a horror show. I\u2019m not even joking when I say there\u2019s a character that looks like he has cat ears, making him perfect husbando material, but simultaneously impossible to take seriously. Details like this make the show lose all credibility as a serious show and instead make it look extremely silly and jarring. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nFirst off, the opening songs are alright to listen to on their own, but their pop and rock style doesn't really fit the type show that Shiki is. Even though the lyrics fit the series well, that still doesn't fix the fact that the openings don't fit the tone the series is going for. The ending songs while not really the type of music I\u2019m more partial towards, fit the series way better because they\u2019re more depressing and ominous tone. One notable nitpick is that the opening\u2019s visuals spoil some major plot points, through painfully obvious symbolism. This is unfortunate as it serves to kill a lot of the tension and suspense that is crucial to such a show dead. The ost by Yasuharu Takanashi, who also worked on Fairy Tail, Naruto Shippuden and Sailor Moon Crystal is pretty decent both as a stand-alone and in context. It more often than not, does an incredible  job at building up this creepy, eerie and dare I say subtle atmosphere that the show desperately needs. As a matter of fact, I had a member of my family listen to it and she said that it reminds her a lot of the atmosphere that permeates throughout the main body of acclaimed author Stephen King\u2019s novels.\\n\r\nSub and dub were alright I didn't really have any complaints about it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI\u2019m a big fan of more or less anything with vampires, social commentary, gray mortality and massive amounts of gore, so needless to say Shiki was right up my alley, despite the fact that I\u2019ve seen series execute the same ideas it brings up better. Besides its basic element that appeal to me though, the ending 4-6 episodes contain some of the best unintentional comedy moments I\u2019ve seen in quite some time. This for the most part, but not exclusively because it just somehow turns into a massive bloodbath, including a huge forest fire, people going on massive paranoia induced freak outs and acts of brutality and cruelty that rival Phantom Blood in that special hammy goodness that we all know and love. Thanks to these final episodes, I was stuck  smiling with glee as the show\u2019s cast would turn on each other like wild animals.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nShiki is a very mixed bag for me. As a horror series, it's pretty standard for anime in how much it underplays the strengths of the genre. As a thought piece that delves into the diverse and opposing perspectives of the show\u2019s cast for the purpose of blurring the lines of the common perception of morality, it only does so to a rather shallow degree. This is mostly due to the hamfisted nature of the show\u2019s drama, that mostly just comes across as overplayed and pointless, with only the main characters and a few of the side characters aiding in stopping the whole thing from completely falling apart. If you're the type of person that doesn't like senseless gore and the comically pretentious execution of relevant moral dilemmas then you probably shouldn't watch this show. Nevertheless, as far as series with vampires go, Shiki isn't that bad relative to what other series have done with them and even though I have been quite negative about it, I feel that shiki is a fun ride and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a good time waster.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial thanks to my paid in Yugioh cards and slightly pissed editor, Lonecrit for his help on this project.\\n",

            "content": "I'm utterly speechless...\r\nMoments ago I finished this anime and I must say nothing has truly touched my heart like Shiki has. It took me about two months to get through this anime because of my long \"currently watching\" list. I have a bad habit of postponing the final episode of a lot of anime that I watch - mostly the ones that I love with all my heart - because of my fear of seeing the show come to an end. Well, I finally plucked up the courage to watch the final episode of Shiki and I will say that this overall has been oneof my favorite anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, the art, the music, the characters, oh my gosh, I loved it all. I think that the way the entire plotline was played out was simply amazing. Watching as the story unraveled was, to me, like a flower blossoming, perfectly timed out and beautiful. The creators did an incredible job showing the struggles of both the humans and vampires, making it almost impossible to choose which side you want to root for. \\n\\n\r\nI loved how the art style was a little different than what I'd normally see in an anime. The distorted hairstyles and eye designs was particularly my favorite features on the characters - not to mention Doctor Toshio's stubble (hehe). Character development was a major strength Shiki contained in both protagonists and side characters. The progression that Toshio and Seishin undertook was so incredible that you could actually SEE them changing. As for the growing and diminishing relationships between everyone: amazing. \\n\\n\r\nWhat really won me over was the breathtaking soundtrack. Everything about the music that was played throughout Shiki was just... beautiful. It really brought out the emotion in the show and it's even the reason I ended up crying when it was finally over. I adored this soundtrack so much that I downloaded it to my phone and listen to it daily. To me, music is what mainly makes a show good (well, along with plot but you know what I mean), and Shiki did an outstanding job with it.\\n\\n\r\nI am really happy to have watched this anime, and very sad to see it finally come to a close. If I were to recommend any anime in the world to someone, it would be this one.",

            "content": "A boy who cried wolf horror thriller anime with the paranoia, death and bloodshed to great effect...\r\nShiki for LA lives up to it's name of a rather uniquely abnormally well done horror thriller vampire story with interesting characters, plot of a village rapidly dying off and a good use of common vampire lore taken to interesting extremes.\r\nFirst and foremost before LA starts going in depth with Shiki, is that well...welcome to LA's Halloween anime review for 2017, yes it's early but by the time LA is wrote this, the coincidental timing of the date of this review was a perfect time write about Shiki evenif it's not exactly Halloween yet...so with that out of the way...\\n\\n\r\nShiki as an anime is experimental in it's animation, from trying new techniques in conveying visual storytelling to symbolism of how the characters feel or a thinking and even then LA thought that the experimental part seeped into the characters designs, such is the case of the MANY main characters weird hairdos, weird yes but practical as it becomes easy identifiers nonetheless. The experimental animation techniques used from the grimy sepia texturing to split screening transitioning was a good touch, add in the \"shiki\" aspects of it in contrast to the human characters from even their character designs and how they are framed and it's easy to tell that the visual symbolism of some shiki vs. humans was put in great detail as experimental as the animation was. If LA would praise Studio Daume then it's it's wacky yet intentionally well crafted animation even for a genre such as horror.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was by in part a decent affair, from great voice acting ranging from Aoi Yuuki, Tooru Ookawa, Kouki Uchiyama, Nobuhiko Okamoto, Haruka Nagashima, Keiko Kawakami and Haruka Tomatsu all doing great performances. LA would like to bring up Tooru Ookawa as probably having the most badass yet solemn vocals of this voice cast and along with Aoi Yuuki and Haruka Nagashima probably got LA's favourite voice actors of Shiki and they seriously did a damn fine job in each of their respective roles. LA normally doesn't talk about soundtrack but the OST of Shiki ranges from haunting choir vocals to thrilling traditional Japanese folklore percussion score which is highly atmospheric and sure the same 2 OST's are used ALOT however are used appropriately when used but yeah still effective for a horror thriller anime.\\n\\n\r\nShiki's plot by all accounts involves death and one of the \"main characters\" right from episode 1 so there is not point in hiding this in Shiki and it just keeps getting worse and worse not even by the halfway mark. Shiki manages to keep itself hidden about what it's main villains (the Kirishiki family) goals are but at the same time we having an inkling of what is going on or what we suspect as well as allowing the main characters to naturally figure it out and try to stop the \"epidemic\" that is plaguing the small village of Sotoba and convince the rest of the village before it's too late but with the Kirishiki's putting up a HEAVY resistance in an extremely clever way. This resistance later on, especially with the Kirishiki's \"resources\" doesn't make itself to be a typical \"vampire monster, kill it\" kind of ordeal instead what LA saw from this as LA gotten more information was that the Kirishiki's with the resources they have with the few weaknesses they try to hid are like an ironically living, breathing system they made for themselves as HEAVY resistance which puts the main characters on their last legs at worst due to how carefully the Kirishiki planned everything two heck FIVE steps ahead of the main characters trying to stop the deaths in Sotoba.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters, there is a HUGE cast of characters and again due to the fact that MANY of it's huge roster of characters dies, LA would like to talk about some notable characters first. Toshio Ozaki who's voiced by the awesome Tooru Ookawa is by in large one of the biggest threats to the Kirishiki's and also the one that has nothing to lose in order to stop the \"epidemic\" considering he's a doctor, he has the majority of focus in this anime due to him being the one that finds the clues and some of the first one's in being suspicious of the Kirishiki's. Toshio also brings in the entire lore of the shiki's due to some...*ahem* gruesome experimentation so he also adds to the world building of the shiki's and yes if you haven't guessed with all that, he's one of LA's favourite characters in Shiki. Natsuno Yuuki voiced by Kouki Uchiyama is a lone wolf kind of teenager wanting to go to the city however he like Toshio are one of the first ones to investigate the shiki, he is another pivotal character in the anime who helps Toshio in one damn fine plot twist LA didn't expect as well. LA did understand him being in this anime from helping Toshio in a crucial point of the anime as well as mainly trying to be a contrast to one of the more powerful shiki's by the name of Tatsumi voiced by Wataru Takagi about the morality of monsters and feeding off humans being a good or evil dilemma. Next is Megumi Shimizu voiced by Haruka Tomatsu who actually has a crush on Natsuno and also wants to get out of the boonies to be in the city like Natsuno does, she does accelerate the demise of certain characters in the anime but LA did like Megumi as a character as odd as this is gonna sound, mainly for her just wanting to fulfill her ambitions and as bitchy as she was in the anime, LA would say that in some form or another, she was right about Sotoba in many ways. Hmmm what else...ohhh Masao Murasako voiced by Shinya Takahashi is the WORST character in the entire anime (yes, he's worse than the literal bloodsucking vampires) as LA hated him quite early on and he never changed in which on the other hand, Ritsuko Kunihiro voiced by Nozomi Sasaki is the PUREST character in the entire anime bar none, Tomio Ookawa voiced by Kouji Ishii was although badass and probably the strongest character in the anime, he went FAR too off his sanity by the finale making him \"nearly\" as despicable as Masao however he at least was fueled by anger and paranoia, Masao however was horrible through and through. The Tanaka siblings Akira and Kaori voiced by Keiko Kawakami and Haruka Nagashima respectively were prominent early on as well due to the influence of Natsuno however Akira got his badass moment and although he's hotblooded, he was actually the levelheaded one of the two, Kaori on the other hand being \"friends\" with Megumi was the shy meek kinda girl however LA just thought that she was the one that nearly lost it in a psychological level due to all that happened in Shiki as a whole and just felt sorry for Kaori heck Akira as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe \"villains\" of Shiki, being the Kirishiki family although they are mysterious and haunting to say the least from their character designs, as little screentime as they have as a whole, you can feel their presences in ways through the \"epidemic\" they caused as well as the system they put in place that they won't go out without a fight. The aforementioned Tatsumi is a big threat at the start of the anime however he's not the major villain, it's not even the suspected Chizuru and Seishirou voiced by Ai Orikasa and Gackt respectiv- wait GACKT VOICED HIM!?!?!?...*ahem* it's Sunako voiced by Aoi Yuuki is the \"ringleader\" of the entire anime. Sure she might not look it and however her dilemma that she struggles with what she is and becomes fond of the Junior Priest Seishin Muroi voiced by Kazuyuki Okitsu and his novels of two brothers being rather similar to the shiki's. Sunako by the end of the anime is the major focus of the anime but LA will talk about that one later...  \\n\\n\r\nOther characters LA didn't mention that turned shiki themselves do bring snippets of their personality and backstory in the anime and that at the very least brings in some clarity to what they wanted even though they are already dead. Kinda shows that in an anime like Shiki, that even in death your backstory and personality actually enriches you with more screentime than alive. Even with that LA found that even small attention to detail to even the minor of characters right down to their attire to their facial expressions (dead or alive) sorta gave an outlook to the myriad of characters in this anime. Nonetheless as a huge of cast of characters as Shiki are and the what is left of a main cast that has the limelight, the character development are balanced to say the least and with those in the limelight given interesting developments as the anime went on and how it affected them.\\n\\n\r\nShiki's vampire lore to say the least is uniquely interesting sorta like mixing in vampire lore with zombies with certain traits being prominent than the other, from shiki's not able to touch direct sunlight and can only move at night to shiki's having vampire fangs and the ability to regenerate themselves and the most traditional of the vampire lore of killing shiki's only through the stake at the heart. Toshio finds these out later on as LA aforementioned but LA just loves how Shiki uses common traditional vampire lore and mixes it to make what is an hybrid vampire zombie...a corpse demon in a ways and Shiki abiding by it's own shiki logic and NEVER breaking it's own rules it put in place.\\n\\n\r\nShiki also brings up the morality of monsters which is a huge focal point of Sunako but it's the entire \"monsters feeding off humans like livestock\" yet humans do that to animals so what's the difference situation and it does it to great effect, sure what the shiki's are doing essentially killing off it's own population out of hunger is a terrible thing and the Kirishiki's themselves know this but they do it anyways, tearing families apart for food, but like Natsuno and Tatsumi's ideologies clashing with one another as well as Sunako's own existence comes off as a poignant point when by the finale LA even realized that even humans can be crueler than the \"monsters\"...kinda proven by actions of Tomio Ookawa.\\n\\n\r\nSo the finale heck the last 4 episodes of Shiki takes itself of it's depressing, near end of it's rope story it built up for itself and ratchets itself up to a freakin' massacre and goes out in a literal blaze of glory by the end of the anime. LA just wasn't expecting Shiki to go from 0 to 1,000 just like that and the final 4 episodes is where ALL the bloodshed and REAL deaths REALLY happens and JESUS does it go all the way with it. What was a witch hunt ultimately turns into a gory extremely brutalized detailed massacre to save the village of Sotoba and brings in the focal point of Sunako and her questioning her own existence and morality. Sunako was early on a mysterious character with some vague backstory given (which was enough all things considered) but by the end of the anime, the existence of shiki's and herself to her views on humanity and how humans would view her and trying to find salvation where God turns her away was a great deal of character development to essentially a centralized sympathetic villain character and all the better for it as it helped with Muroi's decision by the end of it. Now there is just one thing LA will say was a bit of downer to this finale however as much of a blaze of glory and how batshit gory massacre it lead itself to but the finale felt like it \"didn't end\"...LA hopes that the Shiki Specials would end it but LA did feel unsatisfied that the anime \"didn't finish\" Sunako's story or the fates of many of the cast, but the finale did have it's better moments for LA to not outright hate this ending...it was great but it could have at least \"finished\" it.\\n\\n\r\nShiki is probably one of LA's favorite horror animes of all time now for LA along with Higurashi's first season, LA might not like the horror genre in general but Shiki is a solid horror thriller anime with a great take on the classic vampire story taken to it's extremes in many great ways and was done with precise well thought out execution of how it's plot and characters were handled and is a great Halloween anime if your into vampires with a great twist to them.\\n\\n\r\n\"Death is terrible for anyone. Young or old, good or evil, it\u2019s all the same.\"",

It made them look more horrific and creepy.I really liked the music and animation of the openings.The first opening shows the horror and the mystery arround the events that are occuring at that time and the second opening shows the agony and the upcoming \"revolution\" of the \"victims\".I think that both openings fit very well the anime.Ididn't like the endings though.There were characters that I really liked like Natsuno and Ozaki but also characters that I really hated like Muroi,Megumi and Masao. I really liked that it shows that both sides were right and wrong.Overall,I believe that it is a really great horror and mystery anime,but because of the plotholes,the unclear and confusing ending and the almost poor character design,I rate it with 9.",

But I'm glad I finally started it :D . The story is very interesting it shows to us vampires as they should really be and not the love doevey creatures we are now used to. Although I gave a 7 in the story because first of all as interesting as the story was, the main sabject wasn't something really unique and secondly I was kinda dissapointed with the ending.Bat this didn't discourageme from liking it. The animation is very good  with very bright colours. The sound was also very good. The first opening was interesting but the second was just AMAZING !!!! Also the voice actors made a very good job. The actuall problem that I had with this anime was the characters. Although this anime had one of the best character developments ever (I'm refering to doctor Ozaki) most of the other characters with some very few exceptions are very supid. Also I believe this anime had one of the most ridiculous characters designs I have ever seen. Why am I saying that? Watch it to understand. Apart from that I really enjoyed this anime. It kept me really on edge in almost every single episode. In the beggining it may be a little boring for some people (for me it wasn't) and complicated because there is a wide variety of characters. But if you bare with it then you will see a very interesting anime that it will make you thing and even cry at some moments.",

Well Toshio my favorite, Toshio is such a well written character he cares so much about his patients till it effects his own health. His driving force,determination,and knowledge makes his an unstopable charcater, in other words, bad ass.\r\nI understand Seishin a lot aswell he's one of my favorites as well. His view on life is just as bleak as mine. He is the foil to Toshio. He has good reason for what he does but sometimes it to the viewer it doesn't make sense. He is an imporatnt charcater for the plot though, he drawsthe line between humanity and monsters and he helps to show that their is really not that much of a differnce. Toshio comes in and further inhances what Seishin says.\\n\\n\r\nThe charcaters are all so differnt I don't even have time to go through all of them individually, they all have rich lively personalities and they make the series addicting. I remeber when I first watched this I had to buy this just had to! And it was time and money well spent. There is no way to just sum up the beauty of this anime in a review it is much too complex, it goes beyond the sterotypical Twightlight nonsense, it is a vampire story that owns it self it's independent. I love the character development and the interations.",

Well after this anime, I come to like vampires.\r\nAnime's story is very interesting and in my opinion it makes you curious about the next episode everytime you finish watching an episode, other than first a few episodes. I think Shiki's story is really good which as almost every anime story has it has a few minor flaws and just for its story, Shiki deserves being watched. Another point I like about Shiki is its characters, they're all have different points that makes you connect to the anime more. Also the art used inthe project, in my opinion, completely fits the atmosphere of the anime. I can't say I really liked the first OP and the first ED of the anime but the second ones and the OST were very good.\\n\\n\r\nBut as everything has a few flaws Shiki has its owns too. I can say it totally makes you empathize with vampires, which I think is a really interesting thing, but also makes it a bit illogical. Well as introduced in anime in fact vampires might not be bad creatures that go and suck people's blood because they want to, but it stilll doesn't change the fact they need to suck human blood and because of that they kill people. That is one point I think as a flaw Shiki has.\\n\\n\r\nOverally, Shiki is an outstanding anime which I think everyone should give a try.",

            "content": "While Shiki started off very slow, this series has turned out surprisingly good, with some great characters, a very suspenseful story, and a great soundtrack to boot. That being said, Shiki\u2019s main strengths are definitely it\u2019s huge cast of characters, and it\u2019s story.\r\nThe basic premise to this show is rather simple; the setting is a small, isolated little village that\u2019s called Sotoba village, and vampires stealthily try to take over. What this show does a great job at is building up the tension between the main characters, such as Ozaki and Natsuno, and the vampiric faction of \u201cmansion on the hill\u201d. This inherent conflict iscentral to the entirety of the show, all the way until the bitter end. The characters in this show are really developed well, especially Ozaki and Natsuno. Their eventual realization of what\u2019s going on around them, and the fundamental changes to both their behaviors and thought processes, is definitely interesting to watch, more so as you see the horror-inducing events that unfold.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters such as Tatsumi and Ookawa play crucial roles in the show, while others such as Muroi and Sunako just add to the mystery in this show. I don\u2019t know quite how to describe it, but the sheer amount of characters in this show are all integrated extremely well into the main plot, making a very believable and gripping tale that keeps you captivated for the entire second half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing with this show is that you need a bit of patience to finish it, mainly because there are huge chunks of the series that are extremely slow paced. The slow pacing allows for some excellent buildup, but at the same time I do wish that they could have condensed certain parts a bit more. It\u2019s really the second half of the show where everything starts to pick up significantly, and becomes so much more mesmerizing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art direction is a little odd, but the music for this series makes up for it mostly. The music has a gripping, haunting sound that fits the atmosphere to this series almost perfectly, and really gives the show the edgy, horrifying feeling that you\u2019re looking for in certain scenes. And oh boy, can some of these scenes be gruesome and nauseating. But that\u2019s exactly the type of events that keeps moving the plot forward, along with all the moral and social implications of all the events that unfold.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some rather complex, or perhaps the better word would be deep, themes found in this show that really makes you question exactly who is the villain and who is the victim at times. While I can\u2019t say that this is the most horrifying thing I\u2019ve seen in anime, it\u2019s definitely one of the better horror themed anime I\u2019ve seen in a while. It makes you both think about what\u2019s going on, and truly appreciate the complexity and depth to much of the situation and plot. Overall, Shiki is an excellent series that is well worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation Quality: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Soundtrack: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.0/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSetting: 8.0/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.3/10 (Rounded down to a 8 on MAL)\\n\\n\r\nComments and feedback are always appreciated :)",

Starting off at a normal rural village called Sotoba . Where a series of deaths start off after a family transferred to a castle somewhere up on the mountains and made their residence there. \r\nStory 9/10\r\nThe story it self was quite boring at the 1st few minutes of episode 1 but as it moves on it began to spark my curiosity. The story develops quite well its not quite predictable and you aresometimes left at the edge of your seat. Cause not always you feel pissed about the vampires you sometimes feel the pity on them that they are really just people who want to change back . The story in my opinion develops soooooooooo well and it just gets more exciting and it feels like a soap opera.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10 \\n\r\nThe art style itself was unique but sometimes the faces of some characters are so elongated so it gave me quite a bad impression at first but as you progress through the anime you easily forget the art and focus more on the story .Some characters by the way are nicely done with very unique detailed faces but for some not quite its like having a ton of artists working on this\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe sounds where good in where blood and guts and the screaming. Were nicely done the voices felt so into the show itself that it made you love the show even further but the beginning song and ending where not so good in my opinion .But what the heck we all have different tastes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were so many that i cannot even memorize them all the whole town is involved so yeah there are a lot of characters and develop for some key characters and quite good but sometimes to unbelievable. Too heroic to corny if i may say and some are down right annoying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 \\n\r\nHehehehe I really loved watching this and i am sure you will also the more you go through this the more you will be glued to your seat. I laughed, i got pissed i ,felt pity ,lots of emotions really. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 \\n\r\nTo give my final words about this i urgeeeeeeeeeeeeeee you all to watch this . I am sure that 26 episodes of fun will be waiting for you . You all will not regret watching this that's all for this time.\\n\\n\r\nThank you and God Bless!",

The first is the \"horror\" part. \r\nVampires in a small village, mass killings, etc. The usual stuff. Shiki starts out well with this for the most part but plays the majority of its cards too early leaving for very few surprises in the endgame.\r\nShiki is rarely unpredictable when it comes to the plot, though that isn't necessarily a bad thing. By not trying to outwit the viewer, it can excel at times in presenting whatyou came to see, vampire horror. At least early on.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately Shiki suffers from chronic horror movie. That being that for some reason, an entire village could be wiped out without doing anything more then saying \"well, lot's of people have died lately. Maybe there is sickness going around?\" The ending even felt like your typical horror movie. Which is not a good thing in any sort of way.\\n\\n\r\nThe real problem is that rather than build up the vampires into fearsome opponents, a 180 is attempted to have the viewer look at things from a new perspective. I'm sad to say that it is a sorry attempt. \\n\\n\r\nImagine reading a history book that tries to make you sympathize with Nazi soldiers working at a concentration camp. Seems laughable right? Well now imagine that same book, only with whiny Nazis who spent 3/4 of that book saying how killing prisoners didn't matter/was their right. All the while going \"woe is me\"...If that sounds good to you then Shiki is calling your name.\\n\\n\r\nThe above is primarily the second part of Shiki, the \"ethical questions\". The trouble is that except for one exception, there are no times in which I ever wondered what the right thing to do should be. The \"grey\" areas really are fairly black and white.\\n\\n\r\nArt-7\\n\r\nThe overall look of Shiki works well. Backgrounds, objects, movement, and such all work well. Character models are fine though some characters' hair may be jarring at first. When more intense scenes are done, the art style changes slightly for a more gritty look which can give off a reasonably discomforting feeling (which is a good thing). On another note, I could never figure out if the Shiki eyes were just for the viewer to discern who is dead and who isn't, or if the people in the village were able to see them as well, since 100% black/blue eyes are a bit of a obvious give away that nobody seemed to notice...ever.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\r\nShiki's music isn't the kind that will leave a lasting impression on most people but it does its job and accomplishes it well. Both OPs are interesting and worth a few listens (though the 2nd OP doesn't quite fit Shiki's atmosphere). The music within the show, again, works well. Basically, the music adds to the atmosphere whether it's tense or philosophical or whatever.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is pretty solid all around, with nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-3\\n\r\nThis will be lengthy as Shiki has lots of characters and some need to be mentioned specifically.\\n\\n\r\nI recognized from the start that Shiki never really intended to have major character development. It was simply a matter of showing how particular kinds of people dealt with particular situations. That was fine, some of my favorite stories of any media use that kind of approach to characters. The trouble is that for this kind of approach to work, one either needs to be able to sympathize with characters, or appreciate some kind of morale situation they are forced to confront. Shiki, for the most part, doesn't allow for either. \\n\\n\r\nOzaki was the best part of Shiki. His character was the most interesting and developed. I genuinely liked him and thought he would be the push Shiki needed to turn into something truly engrossing. While it didn't turn out that way, it's fair to say that Ozaki was a solid character and worth singling out here.\\n\\n\r\nNatsuno starts out fine and continues throughout Shiki at that same level of fine. Basically, he never changes. Ever. Which is a shame because instead of watching his progression as a character, he ends up being used as a kind of plot device who seems to get less screen time than other less important characters. At least he is likable I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nTomio Ookawa isn't even a truly important character but I had to mention him because I just loved this guy by the end. When he spoke (read: shouted in a manly way) I payed attention.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest, there is a large cast of village characters of varying importance and you will (surprisingly) most likely know the majority of their names. You may even start to care a little for them. Sounds promising right? Except that they never really do anything, or if they do then it's done off screen with only the barest mention of the occurrence later on.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi-sympathy level=0. I'll just leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nMINOR SPOILERS CONCERNING THE BELOW CHARACTER\\n\r\n Sunako is a piece of work. I decided to withhold judgement on her character until the end of the show. I kept waiting for her constant \"Philosophical\" (yes it does deserve to be in quotations) speeches to start being, well, valid? That's a big mistake. On hand she cries about being \"forsaken by god\". On the other she sees nothing wrong with mass murder for the sake of her own life. The \"forsaken by god\" thing bother me especially. What does religion of any sort have to do with her condition? There was no mention of the afterlife to make me believe that she or any shiki would be damned or something of that sort. \\n\r\nA metaphor then for the way she must now survive? Well even that isn't fully explained. Perhaps the manga explains it better but within the anime no explanation (that I noticed) accounted for why she or any shiki had to kill people rather than just take a meals worth of blood and leave that person alone until they recovered, moving on to a new victim. From start to finish she sounds like a whiny, selfish, useless brat and that is just about the extent of her character.   \\n\r\nEND OF MINOR SPOILERS\\n\\n\r\nSeishin is a horrible character. This man makes no sense at all (okay, he makes some sense but he is still a horrible character). He starts out as a kind of supporting character for Ozaki and then devolves into pure mush. After lots of thought about him I feel comfortable saying that I understand his character and why he chose to do certain things. The trouble is that his character isn't strong enough to get away with those reasons, leaving him look like he is just a puppet.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-3\\n\r\nThe trouble with enjoying Shiki is this. Want horror? You can have it for maybe 3 episodes that are spaced out through the other 22 (24 counting OVAs). Want some grey area, philosophical questioning? Well you can have it as long as you don't actually think about what the characters are saying or said previously or you will then realize what a load of bull you are being asked to swallow (with the exception of one poor sap who just couldn't win and who sorta kinda got the girl, sorta). I actually laughed at (with?) Shiki more than I was nervous or thoughtful. That's right, I'll say it again. I liked Shiki more as a comedy than I did anything else. The 2nd OVA especially had me dyeing laughing at a series of events that was in no way meant to be funny. To be quite honest, If I re watched this series while going into it looking to laugh, I would rate it higher.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-3\\n\r\nShiki could have chosen to focus on horror or ethics but instead doesn't really succeed with either one. Art and sound are both fine. Majority of characters don't succeed in promoting any emotional attachment or ethical quandary.\\n",

            "content": "Never in my lifetime of reviewing anime (or at least the two years I\u2019ve been doing it) have I thought about a show that can be a true mystery that can keep on the edge of what\u2019s to happen and something that keeps you asking questions about it. Granted, the mystery genre is a bit iffy to me most of the times, considering some of them might be predictable at some parts or at least to me, it is, but I still enjoy some of them. But with this title and what\u2019s it about, there\u2019s something about it that makes it one of the moreinteresting anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nA mysterious disease has struck the rural village of Sotoba. People young and old are falling ill, then dying just days after the symptoms appear. At the same time, a new family has moved into a conspicuous mansion on a nearby hill. Could these newcomers, the Kirishiki family, have anything to do with the deaths sweeping across town? The village doctor, Ozaki, is busy trying to solve the problem from a scientific perspective. Meanwhile, the local priest Seishin investigates the victims' circumstances while having some morbid late-night conversations with the Kirishiki family's daughter. Natsuno Yuuki, a high-schooler, has also become suspicious after a classmate's death. Are the dead coming back to life and feeding on the living? Faced with an idea straight out of fiction, the people of Sotoba must stop the crisis before they become a village of death.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about the story is that it represents a true mystery of who or what done it, as it kept me thinking of who\u2019s going to bite the dust next from this epidemic. Now here\u2019s the twist that I never got from first glimpse of the series or what little have I heard about it\u2026\u2026the dead coming back called Shiki is the exact thing as a vampire, as in the creature who comes out at night to suck your blood, leaving bite marks on your neck, causing you to go anemic, possibly killing you, and they look creepy as hell. OK, I may go off the tangent with the vampires but you can the signs of it being there. The horror element in here is being represented very well with the right amount of creepy and thrills without being overbearingly shocking just for the thrills of it. Hell, I think most vampire enthusiasts would be thrill to hear about this show, especially those who like vampire anime that might be a bit displeased with most vampire media today.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are a bit iffy to describe considering that there is a lot of them in the show and they have perfectly focus on every character without them feeling like an afterthought or forgotten, but try not to get attached to them because be warned, a lot of people in this show gets killed off and not everybody is safe from harm. Two characters that I actually like, sister and brother Kaori and Akira Tanaka\u2026.I really hope nothing too fucked up happens to them but I can\u2019t bet on that as I watch the show. I will say that the first character to get killed off, Megumi, is the one character that really annoyed me at first with her being a brat, being a bitch to everyone especially to some of the people that consider her a friend, and her obvious crush on the main character Natsuno, who doesn\u2019t like her at all and I don\u2019t blame him.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was brought to you by Daume, whose resume is mostly a lot of romantic comedy and slice of life anime, with the exception being Le Portrait de Petit Cossette, and they follow through with the creepy motif and style, although their pupil designs kind of freaks me out a bit. The artwork does feel like one of those paintings that doesn\u2019t seem lively at first but the second you turn away from that, it will surprise you.\\n\\n\r\nMusically, I\u2019m a bit mixed as the first theme does manage to be within the tone of the series and it was alright to listen for the first time but like I do with any other series, I just skip the theme just to get into the show and as for the second theme, it\u2019s about the same as the first only not as noteworthy to even brought out. The overall score is very centric to the mystery aspect and it did also help with the more serious moments of the show, not that this show wasn\u2019t serious in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the dub, this is FUNimation\u2019s work and if you already know my opinion about FUNimation\u2019s dubs is that while I think they make great dubs (and no, I\u2019m not hating on FUNi, so shut up.), I never have these high expectations from them as many people do and for the most part, the dub was pretty alright although there wasn\u2019t that many standouts. Jerry Jewell as Natsuno was fine for what he did and David Wald\u2019s Ozaki was decent as well, even if sometimes the character was sometimes an idiot. I also did like the performances of Cherami Leigh, Alexis Tipton, Luci Christian, and Tia Ballard did good as the role of Megumi.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: This is actually a very well-done horror mystery anime, since it\u2019s more about the mystery of what\u2019s going on rather than the basic horror tropes, especially since they are vampires while they never bash you over the head with it and they didn\u2019t make it as vague and confusing. I say if you have the time, especially in the round of Halloween, and you happened to like the mystery aspect throughout, you\u2019ll definitely like this show.\\n",

            "content": "Have you heard of the Wiesmann? It is, or rather 'was', a German car maker. They made perhaps one of the most stylish, classically-designed cars the world has ever seen. Although powered by BMW engines, Wiesmann was made with German precision engineering, hand-made refinement and pronounced body contours worthy to be called \"classic\", and perhaps the only car you will ever recommend to Count Dracula. Because telling him to have something like a Cadillac is like telling him to live in California and that he should be wearing clothes from Tommy Hilfiger. Telling him to have a Rolls-Royce or a Bentley might fit his imagebut he would rather be a stock magnate from WallStreet. Yet, with Weismann, you're telling him to remain living in Europe, in Transylvania with wickedry, wearing only the best from Caraceni.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to Shiki, the anime that isn't tuned familiar to both the frenzy and sensible anime fans. Only a few have heard of this anime, and fewer could even remember it, but don't get me wrong: Shiki is a class of pure, hand-made, well-thought vampirism.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9\\n\r\nShiki is what some anime fans call as \"Japanese vampires\", but that doesn't exactly fit in the image because Gackt already claimed that title. Yet, this will do really well in contrary to America's set of silly sparkling vampires which only falls in love like a giddy mutt and has the exact behaviors as teenagers do, maybe because a lot of them were in fact written by teens. The concept of the Shiki storyline started as far as the time Abraham knew God, where they survived through time just as how every instinctive creature would survive in this world long enough. It's wickedry in that sense alone, and savagery.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode began fast-forward to the 90's, somewhere in a far-away village called Sotoba, where the life is slow-paced and the folks are contented with afternoon siestas and tractors, well, except for one girl with the pink hair who was voiced by Haruka Tomatsu. Anyway, a string of mysterious \"epidemic diseases\" began plaguing the townspeople with a very similar, unmistakable set of symptoms. Until the town's physician, Ozaki, began investigating the epidemia that resulted to death tolls which aggravates and at the same time insults his profession at the point that he took them personally, the story then just came alive like a Wiesmann's V8-esque roar.\\n\\n\r\nThis 22-episode (and 2 episodes of OVA that you really don't need to bother) vampire story is nowhere short of expectations. It's fast-paced, and was able to present philosophies which the Japanese vampires give their Raison d'Etre.\\n\\n\r\nExpect no less since this came from a light-novel created in the 90's. During those times, writers were still infused with what to do with the literary elements so you won't find characters that has nothing to do with the story and silly back stories that doesn't make any sense. Every character has a role to play, although the exact origin of the \"Shiki\" was never really elaborated, which I took a -1 off the points here, but it's acceptable as accepting that humans evolved from monkeys. There's a missing link, but we're too busy to be bothered by that, so we accepted it as a fact.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are not perfectly sorted-out, and that's what made it grand because you don't make stories with perfect characters in it, unless you're a writer from Power Rangers--or on the sparklepires-novel, or if Hollywood asked you to. I've said each character has a role to play in Shiki, but I didn't say they're finely contrasted. Some of them are annoying, and are slowing a bit of the progress of the plot, like Masao for example.\\n\r\nThat aside, we can focus on main characters who made sense, like Ozaki who is dynamic, and Muroi who is complex. They both existed to counteract each other, putting the plot behind them and worked on with their characterization and their own reasons. This is one fine example of character development--nothing like Glasslip as I reviewed earlier.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, we have the definite character of what makes Shiki as \"Shiki\": Kirishiki Sunako. No, not because she's a violet-haired loli or that she was voiced by Aoi Yuuki, but she harbors the age-old perplexity of life and death. She's knowledgeable and wise, as what vampires should be tormented to live forever about; not like falling in love with some teenager.\\n\r\nHere, this enigmatic characterization makes the maturity of this very Japanese vampire story to sneer at what the American vampire novels have scratched and wasted printing paperbacks.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 10\\n\\n\r\nLet's juz make this 10, it's as vivid as night and as dim as day.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\\n\r\nGood opening and ending songs, especially the 2nd opening song that I forgot the title.\\n\r\nAlso, Shiki has some of the renowned seiyuus, like Tooru Ookawa known for voicing Roy Mustang; Aoi Yuuki who's known for her role as Madoka Kaname. Seiyuu-wise, the seiyuu casting is no slouch at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\\n\r\nCan't enjoy nothing more of vampire novels these days. It's like the world is telling me to make one myself instead.\\n\r\nEven so, Shiki is a Japanese vampirism class of its own. It's a light novel written in the 90s, yet it presented quite different from the usual, but otherwise good, vampire stories of those times. Hence, you got to hand it to Fuyumi Ono who wrote such a good story that innovates the bloodsuckers.\\n\\n\r\nNow that vampires are a relic of the past and what we have nowadays are just some stories made by a housewife, and some other authors that I don't want to be bothered remembering where they just threw the word \"vampire\" in their writings for the sake of ploy, the search for gushing-delectable, bloody-attractive vampire stories is a treasure worth risk-finding even if we all need to go to the uncharted far mountains of Transylvania if it calls for it.\\n\r\nSo yes, anime or not, Shiki is worth every rare vampiric enjoyment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8\\n\\n\r\nAgain, Shiki is the Wiesmann of anime. You may not have heard of this car, but when you do, you just can't help with the allure and attraction it brings.\\n\r\nI really have nothing to say more except to support anyone who thinks of watching it. There's just something I'm not utterly convinced though: the ending, thus, with that reason and the other things I've mentioned is why I opted to rate this as eight (8) overall.\\n\r\nBut in all its entirely, the underratedness of such, Shiki is of Weismann-quality. It's one of the fewest anime there is that is worth the trouble of watching, and it's also categorically accurate to put this in the same bookshelf as Bram Stoker, Anne Rice and Stephen King.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the Wiesmann was defunct last year 2014.\\n\r\nWe may no longer be able to see these classically-designed cars of German engineering. I do want to admit that I want to own a Weismann, but reality is trekking on a different path but I'm proud that I know what this car is.\\n\r\nAnd like the Wiesmann, I'm contented enough to tip my hat and salute to Shiki, even if the anime realm will be willing to forget it in place of near-naked, borderlining-ecchi, low-quality anime we keep seeing nowadays. And I will be so proud to recommend Shiki to anyone who is searching for a good vampire story to watch, because Shiki can top off any vampire story made in the West.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: The last of the real vampire tales worth the praise.",

            "content": "\"Everything eventually faces destruction. Everything eventually disappears.\"\r\nThe vampire genre has been a fairly difficult genre to perfect, and having an entire franchise of movies depicting vampires as sparkly, sexy creatures that stare at each other for the good part of half the series did not help anyone get closer to creating a good show. Now, in terms of anime, there have been a few good vampire genre series, such as the Monogatari series, Blood+, and my personal favorite, Hellsing. And now, after finally ordering the complete set on BluRay, it's time to add Shiki to the list, one of the better, and surprisingly more believablevampire anime out there. Well, about as believable as you can get really...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nA secluded village in the mountains, similar to Hinamizawa in quite a few ways. Not many people live there. It's a peaceful location to live your life. However, the one thing that stands out is a giant mansion on the side of a mountain. No one has lived there for years, until the new neighbors move in. Shortly after they appear, people start dying all around the village. People think it's an epidemic after a while... but there are some people that claim to see those who have died up and walking at night.\\n\\n\r\nA note to Steven King lovers, this series reminds me of the novel \"Salem's Lot\". It's similar in multiple ways. The series starts off fairly dark... somewhat depressing with all the deaths occurring... someone usually dies at least each episode. It's kind of like a death-of-the-week deal... however, about halfway through the series, it slowly starts to go from dark, to disturbing... at least by regular standards. From the very beginning, the story had me intrigued, and each episode I watched made me want to continue, no matter how late it was. The plotline was easily one of the best things about this series. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nShiki had a somewhat unique art style to it. Studio Daume... honestly, until I watched Shiki, I had no idea what Studio Daume had produced. Upon looking them up... I still don't recognize any anime they've produced. But I liked the artwork in this.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the characters had that classic anime style haircut, meaning abnormal hair shapes or colors. As for the rest of the character designs, they were all... for lack of a better word... pleasing, to the eyes. They didn't go overboard most of the time with ridiculous body shapes and sizes, in fact, they were realistic for the most part. And for the scenery, I really enjoyed the visuals. Overall, very pleased. Only thing that I noticed, the most teeny tiny bit, was the fact that from episode 18 and on, it went overboard on the gore, and I mean it when I said overboard.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThis had a solid English Dub. It had many voice actors I recognized, such as Todd Habberkorn, Luci Christian, Cherami Leigh, John Burgmeier, David Wald, Jerry Jewell, and tons of others. They did very well when acting out their roles, and made the characters believable when showing emotion. As for the OST, it seemed fairly limited. I heard one of the same songs play nearly every episode. However, if it weren't for the fact that the song is gorgeous, I would have rated this section lower. And both the openings and endings were well done. I preferred the 2nd opening and ending over the first ones, but it's just my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThere were so many characters in this... too many to count. So, I'll give you a brief description of 5 of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nNatsuno Yuuki, your average 10th grade student. At first appearance, frankly, he seemed like a jerk. He was rude to one of the other characters (despite her being stalkeriffic), and he had a bad attitude, due to the fact his parents forced him to move into a boring town. After the deaths start happening, he gets paranoid and becomes concerned with the wellbeing of others, becomes more human...\\n\\n\r\nToshio Ozaki, the town doctor. Once the deaths start, he swears to figure out the cause. He gets frustrated a lot, with both people and the case, but he seems like a good guy at heart... despite his twisted intents later in the series. To me, he seems like he's kind of the anti-hero of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSeishin Muroi, the town priest, and famous author. He's on the quiet side, but he's one of my favorite characters. I can't really say much about him, other then the fact that he seems to find good in people, no matter what species they are.\\n\\n\r\nSunako Kirishiki, a 13 year old vampire girl (at least when she was turned she was 13), who isn't as violent as the others. My favorite character in the entire series. Why? I can't pinpoint the exact reason, but one of the main reasons is because I feel sorry for her. She was changed unwillingly, and she isn't evil, yet people look down on her as some kind of monster.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi Shimizu, wannabe superstar and stalker. She's madly in love with Natsuno, and she hates everyone in the village. That's about all I can really say. She's kiiiinnnddd of a major bitch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nDespite it's depressing atmosphere, this series was extremely enjoyable. The ending had something left to be desired, seeing as it ended somewhat abruptly and didn't tell us exactly what happened to everyone else, but it was definitely something I'd watch again in the near future.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I learned about the story? Not everyone can have a happy ending, no matter what species they are.",

            "content": "Since I watched this anime in chunks over the course of a little more than a month, take this review with a grain of salt... I may have to watch it over again to experience the full effect of the show.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nContrary to what many people seem to say, I enjoyed the slow pacing of the first part of Shiki (from what I can remember of it). It set an atmosphere surprisingly similar to that of a Slice-of-Life anime, which made the transitions from the beginning to the middle and from the middle to the end quite jarring. The concept of vampires, while nothingoriginal in this day and age, was handled very uniquely in Shiki, which I really liked. At times, the vampires (referred to as either Risen or Shiki, depending on which character is talking about them) were portrayed simply as evil, bloodthirsty monsters. But also, in contrast to that, there were times where you really felt sympathetic for them. The pacing of Shiki is what sets it apart from other anime I've seen (albeit I haven't seen nearly as much as a lot of people). It starts slow, becomes very enthralling near the middle, and then just explodes into an onslaught of depressing brutality at the end. The vast amounts of character deaths also really set a depressing tone throughout, which works very well.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nThe art is very good and solid. Nothing about the art stood out too much, aside from the nice variety in character designs, and nothing seemed out of place.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to Shiki is pretty well done. The voice-acting seemed to be on-par, the music was solid, and so were the sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5/10\\n\r\nHere lies the only real issue I had with Shiki. Now, I'm all for large amounts of characters in my stories, whether they be anime, books, movies, or anything similar. But the problem Shiki had stemmed from an improper handling of its myriad of characters. At the end of the day you just... didn't really care about many of them. This could be partly due to the fact that deaths run rampant in this anime. Character deaths become less personal and more downright depressing on a massive scale. Which works wonders for the tone of the story, but severely diminishes the value of each individual character. I didn't outright despise any character in the anime, and I even liked quite a few (namely Natsuno, Ozaki, Tohru, Kaori and Akira Tanaka, and (for the most part), Sunako and Seishin). But all these characters appeared to share a few deadly flaws. Many of these characters were absent for long periods of the anime. This seemed to result in a few things, such as loss of interest in said character, and frustration stemming from wanting to know what the hell happened to them. And not nearly enough effort seemed to be put in to fleshing out ANY of the characters to their deserved potential (aside from maybe Ozaki). While watching Shiki, I periodically wondered if it would have been time better spent tracking down and reading the book that Shiki was adapted from, JUST so I could give a crap about the characters. There were times where I just got lost as to what any given character was trying to accomplish apart from wandering about aimlessly and not seeming to get anywhere. One thing I also have to mention in terms of characters is Sunako and Seishin. At first, I really was interested in the mysterious relationship between the two. But by the end, there seemed to be no real reason as to why the two were so damn obsessed with each other. And I REALLY didn't like the fact that Natsuno was pretty much dropped halfway through, only to appear near the end with a frustratingly small and pointless role.\\n\r\nTLDR; I just couldn't care too much about or fully understand any character in Shiki.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nLike I said, I did really like some of the characters, the story was great, and for the most part, I enjoyed the ride through the convoluted, mysterious, and compelling anime that is Shiki.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10",

You just wanted it to be over with.The entire anime felt more like it was insulting its viewer rather then insulting their own characters. Instead of hoping something would happen, let it be as small as saving someone the viewer finds remotely interesting, or finding one thing that would make sense to keeping the useless characters and getting rid of the characters that would make a damn to the plot. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for comfort in this anime, there is none. you sorta get the feeling 6 episodes in, then suddenly it draws on tell 17, because the viewer cant get over the fact how idiotic the characters are, forcing you to finish the anime in hopes of seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, that happy ending that, should be there, or even the conclusion that isn't Frankensteins monster. \\n\\n\r\nI understand the grey area that this anime was aiming for, but making a Conflict go on and on and on and on then resolve that conflict to make another conflict that endings in a conflict to the point a conflict turns into a train reck. isnt a conclusion to a plot, its more like a PSA.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want an anime that disregards resolving overall conflicts, or \"a means to an end\". you might like this anime. Heck if you like Frankenstein Monster(those old films) you might really like it. however, if your looking for comfort, or a happy story... even to the *spoiler* of the road. this is not the anime for you.",

Production values aren't through the roof here and it's not super flashy but there isn't anything wrong with it either. Run of the mill anime stuff here, though it looks a bit older than it actually is.\r\nSound-\r\nQuality voice acting for the most part, especially from the leads,though a couple of the supporting characters have very generic, perhaps slightly uninspired voices.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very good and I have several tracks from it on my personal playlist, but it is undeniable that many of the songs sound quite similar and with time and repetition that begins to wear on the viewer. A few of the tracks that were once quite creepy become less creepy when you hear them for the eighth time. The music that does exist is quite good, but a bit more variety would have gone a long way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\\n\r\nThe story and characters are probably the weakest point of Shiki. What the story is trying to do is awesome. It has deep, dark subject matter and the overall message it's trying to hammer home in the end is really intriguing to me and a premise I'm glad they explored. However, the execution is laughably bad. Over and over again characters are just braindead levels of stupid and naive and they'll all do a lot of highly unlikely, improbable, unrealistic things because the plot needs them to. If the characters had any common sense whatsoever the plot simply would not work. There are definitely several holes where if you stop and think for all of ten seconds you can find some pretty big problems. Excellent effort, really cool premise but a swing and a miss with how it was executed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nWatching Shiki felt like a guilty pleasure for me. I really, truly liked it for the most part and I often felt like I shouldn't because the plot had so many problems, but for whatever reason I liked the core concept of it all so much that I kept watching anyway. This show is objectively worse than the amount of which I enjoyed it, but there's no accounting for personal taste. The ending, likewise, falls very hard into the guilty pleasure category. I don't know how much sense it made (hint- not much), but I really enjoyed it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nIf you can get into the concept or the deeper message the show is trying to convey enough to ignore a very, very flawed plot perhaps you'll enjoy this. I did, but I know in my heart of hearts it's a mediocre show.\\n\\n\r\n+Awesome premise and bigger picture message\\n\r\n+A few genuinely creepy moments\\n\r\n+Standout soundtrack\\n\\n\r\n-Plethora of plot holes and logic holes that you cannot think too much about and still enjoy the show\\n\r\n-The soundtrack gets reused too much and the repetition becomes noticeable in a bad way\\n\r\n-Almost all the characters are really, really dumb\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING-  Weak 6\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- Strong 7",

            "content": "In the modern world, society is obsessed with vampires. Vampires have enough mysteriousness and data on them that various writers and directors throughout all mediums of media love creating stories about them. However vampires tend to get a bad rep through works such as twilight and the anime series Diabolik Lovers. These types of stories tend to paint vampires in the light of being bishounens or physically appealing to certain people so that they would be more appropriate for romance stories. However Shiki is different. There are no frills no punches pulled and it's a refreshingly dark take on said genre. \r\nShiki is ahorror anime. Horror was never quite my thing but there are always exceptions to every rule and shiki is definitely one of them. The plot takes place in a secluded Japanese village and follows a group of people that move in and basically a doctor and a student try to prevent the village from becoming infested with vampires. \\n\\n\r\nThe storytelling in shiki is very methodical in nature. The first seventeen or so episodes of this anime follow a very gradual plot progression. I both liked this and didn't liked this. I say this because on the plus side you realize that it's a country village and it becomes all the. Ore sweeter when the people finally realize what's going on and then the real fun begins when things finally explode. However on the negative side it can sometimes be rather dull when you're just kind of waiting for things to get on however the plot progression feels natural at the least.\\n\\n\r\nThere are various interesting themws and social commentaries running through the heart of this anime and the concept of gray morality is explored to the fullest. One thing I always look for in a series or a movie is that the line between good and evil is continuously blurred. This keeps the story Intersting and always keeps the viewer guessing and thinking about the story and characters. The references to biblical stories and the social commentary about eating other species were some or my favorites. \\n\\n\r\nAnother great thing this anime did was the atmosphere the atmosphere was amazing and it really ramped up the ominous fear factor. Some scenes literally can have you guessing until the very last moment and the chilling atmosphere did well in enhancing various scenes and really made it feel like a horror anime. However a major problem with the story is that it can feel a bit fragmented at times. What I mean by this is that they will start showing what is going on with one character than cut it off right before the climax and then return to the character's situation a while later. This creates a lot of lose ends throughout the story and in some cases they show you the end and you kind of have to assume what happens. The vampires themselves are awesome design wise and have a relatable cause so you dont automatically hate them or see them as a villains because both sides have truly awful people. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the characters I personally felt that they were quite mediocre. The main issue is that they were way too many characters in this anime. And when they were dying I felt that I couldn't care. However the Doctor and the monk were good characters and some of the vampires were great aswell. However I felt that many characters could have had more development and fleshing out in general.  One major aspect of the characters to point out is that they behave very realistically. Their fear and actions were very human like. Also character interaction was good with some characters such as the relationship between natsuno and tohru. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation of shiki was great. As this a fairly modern anime it had crisp animation that really enhanced the viewing experience. I did also enjoy the character designs and had no problems with them. I saw this anime with English subtitles and I thought the voice work was very good. The music was top notch as well, the atmosphere that was being built was great and made me feel spooked at times and the opening and endings were very good as weall. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion shiki is a breath of fresh air compared to many other vampire stories in modern media. It's an awesome supernatural horror thriller that gives vampires the respect they deserve. Despite  problems with the characters and the rather slow build up and some fractured story telling, shiki has enough atmosphere, narriative, and thematic material to be a great and worthwhile anime series.\\n\\n",

I have no prior knowledge to what it was about. So I dove in and watched, asking myself so many questions. What is this about? What's going on int hat village? At first I honestly though it was about zombie or something like that. Corpses rising from the grave. Then it became apparent.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI absolutely love the story and it's pace. It's enthralling. It's one of those stories that put you to think (well if you don't already know better),It explores controversial topics about life and death, and existence. It's not an annoying take on vampires, so this one is good.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nI must admit the art threw me off a bit, but I easily looked passed it. It was different from the anime art I've been accustomed to. I got used to it quite fast though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI love the soundtrack of this anime. My favorite OST track is \"Eau de Vie\". \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nA few characters are annoying as hell but the main characters are awesome. Especially the doctor! He was the one trying to put a scientific view into the story. The logical one. He made everything feel REAL.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYeah! Of course!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nA well composed anime if you can look pass the art like I did. I hope you enjoy if you decide to watch it. I'll try to get the light novels for my library. I'd definitely read them.",

Every rules in regards to vampire folklore that you know is applied here,like the vampires must be invited to enter an establishment,they are afraid of sunlight and the good old stake through the heart to stop them. I am not going to dwellto much of the plot as anyone can read the synopsis for that,whereas i will be instead,giving my own opinion about this anime. I feel that this is really a well told anime that will slowly draw it's viewers into the story as it progresses,i sometimes can't help but sympathize with the vampires and that under certain circumstances,especially under great stress,humans can turn into real monsters too. I am sure there are many better reviews on here that will paint a better picture of how great this series is and i don't think i can contribute more to singing it's praise. However,i would just add that what makes a series stands out to me,may not be the great artwork or soundtrack (although that contributes) but by the way how the story captivates its audience with it interesting plot and execution of it's story line. If you really love the horror genre,and couple with good story telling, don't hesitate by missing out on this instant classic as this is my all time favorite horror anime. 10/10 (this review does not give enough justice to this awesome anime series)",

The art was one of my favorite things about this anime, the vampire eyes were beautiful! The little girl vampire and mother figures eyes were stunning as well! \r\nActual review; \r\nThis animes' story line was perfect. The characters had nice back stories and were very relatable.It shows the insanity of an epidimic, and their actions seemed very likely of happening. It was realistic,but still had that 'creepy, mystical, vampire feel to it!' This isn't a stereotypical vampire anime, I assure you- there's not much romance, their isn't a thousand guys fawning over a girl- there's none of that. Though, if you're into that, their is megumi, a petite girl with pink hair that actually is quite scary later on in Shiki. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoy this anime, It's for sure one of my favorites!   \\n",

            "content": "This is pretty much vampires done completely right. Yep. This is the vampire anime for you.\r\nSomething is happening in the town of Sotoba, where people are being killed off one by one. Who's killing those people? Either called The Risen or Shiki. There's the title of the anime for you. These vampires are killing not on purpose, but for their own good. Wait, did that make sense? I don't think so. So, here's whats going on. These vampires are only hungry. Makes sense, vampires always have a taste for blood. So, basically, they end up killing a bunch of people and the town's doctor, Ozaki,is aware of their existence. So they end up going all out in battle and stuff like that.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is always a thing for me. Anime must have a perfect animation in order for it to be good. Is that right? Nope, not necessarily. To me it is, though. I have some weird taste in anime, because I have enjoyed some anime people think I'm being possessed or crazy. They're not in my list, but... yeah. The animation of Shiki is incredibly... incredible.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is great. Often in scenes where somebody is dying, or someone is crying, the music makes the scene even more depressing. There is quite a few depressing scenes in Shiki, I've only cried like a little bitch in about 4 scenes, all containing a certain character. That one character.\\n\\n\r\nOh, characters... we were just talking about you. The characters in this anime are astonishing. Truly astonishing. I often changed my favorite character from time to time due to introducing of new ones. Also, I often didn't know whether I was to be siding with the Shiki's or the Humans. Or werewolves. Werewolves are probably better than all of them. Because it contains my favorite character, again.\\n\\n\r\nI think this review is cut short. I'd normally write... no I wouldn't, I'm lying. This is probably a normal review, well, for me. I think this is the length of almost all my reviews. I enjoyed this anime quite a lot, I dropped it after 3 episodes though, but I recently came back to it. The reason I dropped it was because I thought my favorite character was going to die, but then he only dies a few episodes later, to come back as a werewolf. You'll find out who that is soon enough.\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 10, because it truly is an astonishing experience. You are not going to know who is going to die, unless there's someone you hate, and you had a feeling that person was going to die, then never mind.  Everything in this review is a 10, because I do believe everything was done perfectly. This series went by rather quickly when I was watching it, and I was sad when it suddenly ended.\\n\\n\r\nShiki\\n\r\n  10/10\\n\\n\r\n~ D.M",

Because it doesn't feature fighting, no magic, no Nen, No villains trying to DESTROY THE EARTH!!, nothing. It's just people coming back to life, and becoming vampires. And I love every second of it.\r\nStory - 8\r\nIt doesn't really have the STRONGEST story, it isn't until like, episode 12 when you start to become hooked to the story. These vampires, or shiki, start infesting the village and the people of the village don't do (and don't know) until it's too late, and multiple deaths happen, and people move away. Mostepisodes are just exposition, but it's the last few that'll hold you on the edge of your seats.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nThe art is kind of weird, but you tend to get used to it as you go along. It's not the WORST art ever, just unique.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6\\n\r\nNot many of the non-Shiki characters seem to change throughout the series. But other than Masao, the Shiki are coldblooded killers who will stop at nothing to turn it into a village for them only. My favorites would have to be Natsuno, Megumi, Toshio, and Sunako.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shiki is a violent, GORY series (especially in the last 4 episodes) that will start out slow, but eventually gets better and better as time goes on, and when it's over, you'll want to watch it again. I recommend both Japanese and English dubs.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A",

Stupid DVD-selling gimmicks, LOL.\r\nI'm not too particularly fond of its soundtrack, but I don't hateit either. It's not like there was anything out of place; at the same time, none of its tracks really stood out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shiki is quite a solid series and probably the best one I've seen lately.",

            "content": "Shiki is ravishingly a dark anime. It's the best way to put vampires...the emotions are very strong, so you can easily depict the message of the author: we are all humans, but at some point we have lost our humanity. We are scared of our own blood: our intent to kill; we do what we do to survive; we don't believe in superstitious beliefs, why--because there are huge factors that affect our daily lives deeply: family, religion, dreams, a terrible flashback, and to say Shiki(s) are \"demons\". But they're just like us, like a werewolf to a vampire. They live in the dark, they can'tsurvive in the day because they have isolated themselves probably, believing that they have been 'forsakened' by God. In the end, they are doomed because all they've fought for was lost in the fire. A pure Shakespearian inspiration, I hope? \\n\\n\r\nStory - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFirst episode's always boring, but I've lived until the very end of it. The story remains enigmatic; there are answers that you can only know in the next chapters, and that's the best part of Shiki. You never know that werewolves were a rare breed, that this character had a past that would serve as an irony in the next couple of years (am I right Hasegawa-san). Although I can't give it a perfect 10, because I'm disappointed that there were no restraints to how ruthless, violent and almost disgusting parts of the story haven't been erased. To me, it's 'illegal' to the eye, despite the genre (the young doctor torturing his wife, the no-words-to-describe HORROR parts that I wish I would never see in a lifetime).\\n\\n\r\nOne word to describe the story? Unpredictable. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say? It's anime, but Shiki never fails to make each episode a masterpiece. Every flashback, every teardrops are crystal and the way the animation progresses, it gets better. For example, there are horror scenes where the character thinks she can see through the windows, or the barrier. The art is impressive because the drawings are being dealt sensibly. There was too much blood, on the other hand, that I guessed the creators didn't mind showing--which can be bad for the public audience. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI have no problem with the voice subs. Wrath, despair, whatever, the voices are very convincing. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST is perfect! Beautiful! Tragic! \\n\\n\r\nAs expected from Yasuharu Takanashi, composer of Naruto/Shippuden. \\n\\n\r\nThe music makes the story charismatic. It what brought me, to be honest; as I was listening to an emotional collection from Youtube. The music makes you want to disappear and fall down into the music's well of wishes, enchanting hungry vampires, or the humans that lived before 'they' (Shiki) coexisted. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI love the characters, but I will just point out some flaws (and striking points).\\n\\n\r\nNatsuno, as said of Ben Affleck in Batman, was too grouchy. Like, he never gave a damn about Megumi--and HE WAS HUMAN.\\n\\n\r\nDoctor Oshio went too f*cking far for his wife. Did he marry her so he could feast with her body? He couldn't have told her what she was, even if dumb people considered that 'Oh, the Doctor saved many lives by killing her', she's still a human being on the 'inside'--did Kyouko even know what she was? What his wife needed was humanity from a fellow human being. You can't deny that the Doctor did the right thing. At least show a bit of sympathy from his eyes, hesitation, probably?? Or else we're dealing with a psychopath that has lost himself, and will get worse. Doctor, I am very disappointed in you! \\n\\n\r\nAt first I was annoyed with Akira and Kaori, who were really annoying. But in the end, they were the good guys, so deserved to live. But--I wish we could have seen more things about the young protagonists; they were limited, I guess. \\n\\n\r\nSeishin was a good person, and the story about the older and younger brother explained in the end was beautiful, it was a story worth-telling and remembering even in dark times. \\n\\n\r\nWho could forget Sunako, a poor girl that was the least evil? I could tell that because she's just a girl, what else?? She was the spokesperson for all the Shikis that lived in the anime. Vampires feed and attack people to survive, and it's not like they chose that kind of lifestyle. Survival was part of living, which means you've had to fight through all the odds. Until in the end, killing didn't matter, because they were so torn in the midst of hunger. Hunger sparked the intent to kill. Hunger was the center of the cycle of energy being passed around Mother Nature. Hunger was the very reason they transformed into monsters. Could they control it? No. But vampires were wrong to kill, either, in the story their existence might probably a mystery unsolved that even the author could not answer. \\n\\n\r\nSunako understood things. She liked reading, she appreciated the concept of death. She's like a deformed angel, and she's choking on her halo. \\n\\n\r\nTohru and Ricchan dying together like Romeo and Juliet...wow. Although I wish he could've kissed her or something like that. Love goes around, and people need it, better than 'hunger'. \\n\\n\r\nSeishirou and Chizuru are poor bad creatures. No comment on that. \\n\\n\r\nI love Tatsumi. At first I hate him, but then I love him for how of all characters, he's the showoff, the extravagant one. He has the style with the clothes, and his hair shape is Wolverine. Anyhow, I think his undying loyalty and pride to lead his people, to serve the Kirishikis until the end--that is a true leader. He knows how to give up, when things have gradually been falling apart, and he will do the right thing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nScary as f*ck, but you'll get used to it. I'm talking about the early to middle chapters. \\n\\n\r\nI have a rant on the later ending chapters: it's too messy, 'screwed' because I think even animators should be doubting if this is something the whole general media should see. Unless if they're limiting their audience, or wanting to shut their doors to actual humans that may find the scene (endless stream of blood, abhorrent replay of decomposing corpses, blood and hammering, again and again!) disturbing, impolite and worst: not their type. At least cut or limit the show. Change it to a better video, like a flashback or whatever. It's too much for the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I recommend this to ones that have a thirst for fantasy, mystery, and something that deals with psychology. It's a good anime that you can relate with, if you look at the dark parts of yourself. Shiki gives humanity a bad impression, and that's good. Can you deal with the truth? Do you fear a lot? I mean, these are just the worst-case-scenarios that could happen. Shiki's teaching us that...don't give into temptation, don't fear death because it's natural, and you can never live on if you keep on hating yourself. Dream on, live in a big city and just don't look down. There are stories and myths that may be true, but in the real world, I guess you can never know until you've seen one huh? So until now, I guess these are all bullshit, but feel free to overlook humanity's capabilities. Deception, fatality, mourning...\\n\\n\r\nI want everyone to watch it, actually. But prepare yourself for a one hell of a ride. Shiki never goes off your head, not for a long, long time. \\n\\n",

            "content": "For me, all 'straight' vampire stories are thinly veiled metaphors for the rise of capitalism. And by 'straight' I mean when the genre is definitively vampire and not romance with some vampire window-dressing. Shiki is a classic vampire tale, which is very much about the clash of one mode of life being violently threatened and subsumed by another. In this case, the location is not Transylvania or Louisiana but an isolated, small, backwater town in Japan. What makes Shiki so interesting to me is that it does it's very best to play things out over a long period time in as 'realistic' a way aspossible.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the story of an entire community and the scope is ambitious. \\n\\n\r\nThere are lots of well written characters and we see so many different ways in which the village's traditional modes of operation (be that religion or medicine, etc) are waylaid by 'corpse-demons'. And this is amplified by the fact that personalities remain intact even as those who die and rise up succumb to their new hunger. You end up sympathizing with several of those turned, as they struggle to deal with being enmeshed in a new existence that is violent by design but one which the only escape from is (another, more final) death. \\n\\n\r\nWith vampirism the ends justify the means. You need to eat, and the only way to do that is to kill. In the process, one makes more vampires. There is no 'outside', you are either a predator or prey. It is almost childishly simplistic. In this regard I love the character of Sunako, who embodies Capitalism's childish needs and simplicity to a 'T'. \\n\\n\r\nA series well worth watching even if the hair styles (imo) are annoying.",

            "content": "\u201cMonsters are real, and ghosts are real too. They live inside us, and sometimes, they win.\u201d\r\n-Stephen King\r\nHappy Halloween Everyone! To celebrate this Holiday of cavities, scaring and little children, I will open with a quaint little question. \r\n\u2026What do you fear? Is it the creature under your bed you know is ready to tear you apart, or glaring red eyes looking directly at you through the window, in the pitch black of the night, begging\u2026 pleading\u2026 that you let them in? \r\nTo start off the day, we will take a look at \u201cShiki,\u201d (literally Corpse Demon) which basically pays homage to all classic vampire stories.In fact, Shiki is actually, as stated by the original author Fuyumi Ono, inspired by Stephen King\u2019s novel \u2018Salem\u2019s Lot, one of his first books to ever be published. \\n\\n\r\nShiki attempts to make a case at how fear truly works; as well as the monsters that radiate it. I mean, Vampires are the real monsters here\u2026 right?\\n\\n\r\n-Just as a pre-thought, this is an analytical review. It digs into what Shiki does philosophically, so be forewarned- \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---PLOT---\\n\r\nShiki takes place in the secluded town of Sotoba, or the \u201cVillage Surrounded by Death,\u201d as often called by its inhabitants due to their signature trade being coffin making. Before anyone realizes what is happening, casuals start dropping like flies due to a mass case of anemia, and the only hint of what\u2019s causing it are two tiny \u201cbug bites\u201d that appear on all the victims. Upon discovery of the disastrous effect this has started to have, the medical staff of Sotoba theorizes that an epidemic is spreading through the town, and the village soon becomes what it has been called for so many years.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s immediately apparent to the audience\u2026 that it isn\u2019t anemia that\u2019s killing everyone.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the intent to frighten, monster mysteries such as this always pose an overarching question or dilemma, that dilemma usually pertaining to \u201chow will the protagonists survive the threat?\u201d Shiki, however, asks something completely different. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Shiki\u2019s raw premise isn\u2019t anything extraordinarily original, it does a fantastic job at conveying an indirect type of horror story through the primitive behavior and emotions of a person. Examples include the feeling of helplessness and rage we experience when something dear to us is torn from our lives, and the unwillingness to believe the unbelievable. It uses these factors to paint a very vague picture about how utterly subjective actual \u201cevil\u201d is, and how easy it is to upset us as beings on a very primal level with the use of fear. Fear is something we experience so that we can keep ourselves safe, but Shiki has demonstrated how an overabundance of fear is something much scarier than any vampire.\\n\\n\r\nMight I add, the utilization of the \u201cShiki\u201d is incredibly true to the actual textbook bloodsucker, as they are afraid of holy items, die in sunlight, and have to be invited into houses. Even more of a plus, Shiki is very, very unpredictable. Horror is usually bound to being a formulaic genre, but this anime has surprised me by somewhat dispelling that. You never see any plot twist in Shiki coming, and it doesn\u2019t ever disappoint, as the twists never feel manufactured, or like they came out of left field. \\n\\n\r\nSo as a refreshing addition to the vampire subgenre of horror, Shiki does very many things right. But there are also a few things it doesn\u2019t do so well. One of its major problems is the pacing of the first half. Not much of a problem when it comes to the ideas that it conveys, but it isn\u2019t something that would keep most viewers glued to their screens, because I know better. Personally I\u2019m not usually bothered by slow stories, as I never really noticed Steins;Gate\u2019s \u201cslow start,\u201d and this one didn\u2019t bug me either. But its true that Shiki uncloaks itself very, very slowly, and it suspends its mystery for moments at a time that take too long, so long in fact sometimes the mystery might seem to drop. \\n\\n\r\nBut, like a vampire, the plot is revived in the later half; with violence that is all but gratuitous. It demonstrates an unspoken social entitlement humans have evolved to have within themselves. The evil we showcase, the animosity we express through our untamed, animalistic nature\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u2026is the closest thing to a true \u201cevil\u201d there is. We side with the humans because we are humans; but are we really in the right? Is \u201cself-defense\u201d justified to any extent, when it is used as a scapegoat for the unlawful act of butchering something just because it doesn\u2019t live the way we do? Is that what we are deep inside, just animals killing other animals and lying to ourselves about the reason behind it? So where is the line crossed, where do we have to draw it? Surely there is one, look at how society has functioned in the past centuries! Even with all the murdering and\u2026 maiming\u2026 and thievery\u2026 and assault\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nWe really aren\u2019t that different from animals are we?\\n\\n\r\nThat right there is the picture Shiki wanted to paint. That is the different \u201cquestion\u201d it asks. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, it succeeded.\\n\r\n---Plot Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---CHARACTERS---\\n\r\nBeing that this is set in a rural area where most everyone knows each other, it\u2019s a given that Shiki would have a very large cast. \\n\\n\r\nWhile there are technically four main characters, I would say the closest character to being the lead is the village doctor, Toshio Ozaki. A big deal of the first half is he scurrying about, trying to find out why exactly the village is dying rapidly, and that\u2019s probably why it might feel slow. His struggle to help his village and destroy the monsters tormenting them once and for all though, proved that probably the main thing he embodies is the instinct to survive, and how it overtakes one entirely in the face of danger. \\n\\n\r\nThe second main character, Natsuno Yuuki, is an easily irritated teenager who lives without the desire to build relationships or make friends, and just wants to be left alone. Unlikable at first, he grows into the type of self-initiated investigator Ozaki is and even if he\u2019s unwilling to admit it, the bonds that he does already share with his friends and family shed light on how much he genuinely does care. He\u2019s the first person to actually see what\u2019s going on, and he puts the village\u2019s unaddressed problems on his shoulders. Through that stubbornness, he indirectly personifies humanity\u2019s persistence to come out victorious. \\n\\n\r\nIn a fight or flight situation, these two are very much \u201cfight.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe third main character, Seishin Muroi, is a junior monk and author. He\u2019s introduced as kind and loving, yet distant and often lost in his own thoughts. He retains this personality throughout the anime, and is a complex person in nature, as he contemplates right and wrong and often is distraught by death. Firmly believing in how \u201ckilling others is never justice,\u201d he has no tolerance for any sort of violence, and demonstrates the more gentle, compassionate side of people as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the fourth and final main character is Sunako Kirishiki. Through subtle dialogue she has with Muroi, her actual intentions become a prominent turning point in the narrative. On the outside, she looks one-faceted, and completely evil. But if Shiki has taught us anything, its how evil is a subjective matter. On the inside, Sunako is a much different thing entirely, though explaining what she ends up portraying would spoil some of Shiki\u2019s biggest surprises.\\n\\n\r\nIn a fight or flight situation, these two are very much \u201cflight.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIn telling the story with this symbolic character usage, Shiki also occasionally jumps to a book Muroi is writing; one that mirror\u2019s the Bible\u2019s story of Cain and Abel. In the story, purity (Abel) is killed by impurity (Cain), but in the end they\u2019re explained as being \u201cone in the same.\u201d This allegory, along with the four lead characters, is clearly meant to corroborate the idea of Shiki being an anime where the characters are representative of humanity\u2019s ideals and truths. And they\u2019re all actually very well developed, especially Muroi and Sunako, and end up being PERFECT for Shiki.\\n\\n\r\nBut almost ALL the other characters fall entirely flat. The majority of the supporting cast felt unrepresentative as either humans or vampires because of misplaced humor, shallow personalities, and ludicrous character motivations that killed any sense of sympathy there was supposed to be. Episode 1 was damn near unbearable because of the character Megumi and her bitchy, teenage, entitled attitude.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because there are so many, they also seem to appear on a whim and disappear immediately, leaving gaps in not only development, but also cohesive flow. But this is more confusing than outright bad, as it makes you think, \u201cOh, he\u2019s still alive. I forgot he existed.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nAnd as one final note, the death count is high. Exceptionally high. If you get attached to fictional characters, then you could have a very hard time watching this anime. But all\u2019s good cause the chance of them returning is even higher. Shiki seems to have mastered the illusion of \u201cinverse plot armor,\u201d where everybody can technically die but will eventually come back to life if the plot demands it. So where the plot is explicitly going and who will die is always never easily foretold, but what IS easily foretold is that WHOEVER DIES WILL JUST COME RIGHT BACK UP OUT OF THE GROUND. \\n\\n\r\nDespite these shortcomings I have to say that Shiki\u2019s use of symbolism with its main characters really fed the story\u2019s purpose well, and even if the supporting cast leaves a lot to be desired, the leads at least did perfectly.\\n\r\n---Characters Score: -Great- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---ANIMATION---\\n\r\nAnime has distinguished itself from other mediums because of its style. Shiki is no different; it\u2019s just a little more\u2026 extreme. The art style is filled with, er, \u201cunique\u201d character designs, ranging from completely mundane to downright ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, I understand why people rip on this category, because the overall style is most definitely not akin to being traditional, and comes off as distracting. But the animation itself, produced by Studio Bones, was pretty good! It has its high points, like scenes when a Shiki was dying due to sunlight, (which were beautifully animated) and it has its low points, like the portrayal of blood. When a character\u2019s clothes are splattered with it, the shape is too definite for it to look convincing. It looks more like patches of red cloth, and it could come off as lazy to some.\\n\r\nBut, what\u2019s that? Vehicles that aren\u2019t CGI, you say? \\n\\n\r\nCGI vehicles are the bane of my existence. CGI anything is the bane of my existence. They\u2019re so ugly; if anything, its stuff like that that takes me out of immersion, and not art style. It\u2019s great to see it avoided.\\n\r\n---Animation Score: -Great- ---\\n\\n\\n\r\n---SOUNDTRACK---\\n\r\nNot much else does Shiki justice like the first opening; it just sounds so right, so well compiled, and I never quite got over that when it was replaced. But they both share a mutual sound of harmonic eeriness.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual runtime soundtrack though, while fitting, is weak alone. The composers sometimes blended more than three different music genres into one piece, so there was bound to be a bit of repeating and I think that away from the show, the soundtrack doesn\u2019t work well. Things like acoustic rhythms, beat boxing, and that creepy 1930\u2019s horror piano are shoved into a single song, and while it adds quite a bit of originality to the sound of the anime, it just feels absolutely messy away from it, like there wasn\u2019t much direction or auditory resources to work with. \\n\r\n---Soundtrack Score: -Substantial- ---\\n\\n\r\nAFTER REPORT:\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n-\tVIOLENCE WITH PURPOSE! Subverts horror directly by taking on the role of being scary not by gratuitous gore or suspense alone, but by combing them both to present an interpretation of humanity\u2019s injustices\\n\r\n-\tUnpredictable when it comes to the direction of the plot and \u201cwho\u201d will die\\n\r\n-\tMystery is downright fantastic \\n\r\n-\tProtagonists are representative of \u201cfight or flight\u201d ideas and core motivations of evil and idealism, and they\u2019re fleshed out really well too\\n\r\n-\tBiblical symbolism fits in to the themes, and the allusion of Cain and Abel works perfectly for the brutal message\\n\r\n-\tThe vampires don\u2019t sparkle\\n\r\nMIXED\\n\r\n-\tOdd soundtrack and art style that can be distracting too many \\n\r\n-\tInitially feels slow, but eventually this pacing issue smoothens out\\n\r\n-\tEnding is yet another mixed bag; though it can easily be interpreted one way or another\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n-\tAnnoying secondary characters, diluting the audience\u2019s sympathy in a way that isn\u2019t necessary\\n\r\n-\tNOT unpredictable when it comes to if they\u2019ll stay dead, and cast gets uneven focus.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: -Fantastic-\\n\r\nShiki is like a fine wine, or an expensive cheese. The more you think about its concepts, the better it tastes. Nothing comes without its problems though, and Shiki is far from any exception. Not only that, but a story like this is specifically created for a purpose. If that type of anime doesn\u2019t do much for you, I\u2019d advise you don\u2019t watch Shiki. But if you do enjoy heavier stories like this, give it a go, shoot back that wine and let it culminate in your mouth\u2026 as it slowly turns to the taste of blood\u2026\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll gratefully give Shiki a 9/10",

Shiki caught my eye within the first episodes and I truthfully have enjoyed watching this series. I would go so far as to rate to rate it a higher score if I could, but the plot really determines whether or not the show is really truly a masterpiece, which Shiki felt like it got the short end of the stick.\r\nStory: The story is simple. Thesetting is set in a peaceful village with friendly neighbors all being part of a close-knit family/community...that is until a new family moves into town. Well, from there, the plot becomes rather predictable, leaving few plot twists to make it truly memorable, but what I do like is that sense of nostalgia of going back to the roots of the old vampire legends of how things were carried in regards to properly \"taking care of them.\" If you are a fan of the vampire genre, especially from the Twilight fan base, you will not find anything beautiful or deeply romantic. What you will find is mystery and a decent thriller because just when you think a victim will survive, ha..ha..nope, another one bites the dust. I will mention that though the story does not really pick up until about episodes 13-15. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was unique yet it also reminded as if it were an adult version of Yu-Gi-Oh on steroids. It took some time for me to get adjusted to the animation style. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I love the first OP and the second ED.  I mean, come on, who doesn't like Gackt!?  The music arrangement plays well with Gothic undertones which adds  more richness to the chilling ambiance of the series..  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  While I don't have any particular favorite characters, the series flushes out main and secondary characters to where you know their personalities, backgrounds and lifestyles. I was also caught off guard thinking that the pink-haired teen, Megumi was going to be the main female protagonist, but I was quite mistaken. I became affected and sympathetic with a few characters about their own beliefs and biases in regards to themes of humanity, survival, classifying whether actions are necessary or whether they are pure evil and so on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Shiki was \\n\r\nS = Satisfactory \\n\r\nH = Horrific\\n\r\nI = Impacting\\n\r\nK = Kooky in artistic style and\\n\r\nI = Irresolute toward plot execution, which is why the rating is a 7 and not a 9 or 10. \\n\\n",

But soon, as the story progressed, I realized how different it is from the other vampire anime I've seen yet.\r\nWell, as much as you (and I) hate to admit it, the concept of vampires is fictitious, yes. But even then, the creator has made sure to utilize this property and add as much realism as possible to this anime. That makes the anime even more likeable. Its not based on the usual concept of vampires rising, people dying, a vampire slayer arrivingand using holy water, crucifix or garlic to slaughter the beasts and restoring Sotoba to its original state or building a world where humans and vampires can live together in peace. No, its not at all like that and this is what gets you even more intrigued to find out what exactly happens later in the anime and also to find out which clan survives at the end - Humans or Vampires.\\n\r\nAnother interesting concept shown in the anime is the Okiagiri. Quite a few mysteries to unravel there, for those who dont know about their existance at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe only drawback to this anime is the extra and unnecessary amount of talking that Muroi does in his philosophical ways. Tends to make you lose interest at times.\\n\r\nAlso, the death of certain important characters might have a certain impact on some of the viewers as they might gradually get attached to them and later feel disappointed by their death. That said, if these characters had actually survived, the anime probably would have lost out on the awesome storyline and great climax towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one anime I'd suggest to all vampire lovers out there!",

You enjoyed something so much and will become one of your favorite... \r\nThis is what I'm feeling about Shiki. Everything was perfect for me. Even if the story has some issues, even if some characters weren't that great, even if the animation could've better on some point, Shiki remembers me everytime why I'm still watching anime:\r\nIn this ocean of harems, moe, genericcharacters and stories exists some animations that you'll remember for a long time and will make you question yourself about its story .\\n\r\nIn the end\\n\r\nWho are the real monsters?\\n\r\nThe Shiki?\\n\r\nOr the humans?\ufeff\\n\r\nThis is your decision .\\n\\n\r\nIs something else, is unique.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, vampires are extremly  popular in shows and books like Twilight, Owari no Seraph, The vampire Diaries,True Blood, Vampire Academy (I can contiune all day),   but they lack in execution and are very stupid. Vampires shouldn't be attractive and desperate after sexual relationships and they shouldn't live in an expensive penthouse for the delight of annoying fangirls who want to be their lovers. That's not right.  \\n\\n\r\nVampires are everywhere nowadays, but beside Shiki, Hellsing Ultimate and a movie and a book named Interview with a vampire written by Anne Rice I couldn't find something good. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning Shiki is very slow paced, but after episode 9 I couldn't stop watching it. \\n\r\nIf I am objective I would give a 7, but because I love it so much and I was feeling so good at the end a 9 is the right choice . \\n\\n\\n\r\n\" Don\u2019t you find it\u2026ironic? I really killed so much people\u2026I may really be an atrocious mass murderer, but i still don\u2019t consider the number of people I killed to be something big. There is no God for us to pray at times like this. There is no one to seek help from. No justice to be upheld in our case. Since I am a murderer. But I becoming a murderer was not because of my ideology, nor because of my view on values. If I\u2019m left without human blood, I\u2019ll die, as simple as that\u2026I became what I am because of the bloodthirsty providence. Muroi-san, this is what having been abandoned by God means\u2026\"\\n\r\nSunako Kirishiki",

Who would've thought that IT would be usedin this way. This is a medicore type of horror, mystery series so do not expect that you'll get scaerd(not that you would get scared because this is just an anime, or so some people think) and also this will not get you thinking about what the cause of the deaths is so much that you'll end up losing any sleep.\\n\r\nCan you guess who the protagonist is from the cast of people who drop like flies?\\n\\n\r\nWith a shonen type of art, i just couldn't get serious about the story at first. I would've liked to see this in seinen type of art(another, aku no hana) with a bit of reality so that the story would feel heavier. But with any series, you either get used to it by 2-3 episodes or you drop that series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts with a pink hair girl(guess what, she has the same voice as Lala from To Love-ru) who likes this boy called Yuuki(yes, Yuuki as in To Love-ru's Yuuki Rito. Damn, could this get any more similar than this!) and she's a stalker(oh, stalkers are scary). The only similar thing between them is that both of them wish to get away from the village as soon as possible, as the village is in the middle of nowhere. As for their fate let's leave that 'to the one who dwells above'. If you are wishing to see some romance, please look for another series.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the review you are by all means to skip it as it will just be me ranting.\\n\r\nThe rest of the show touches part of human ethics and asks(the viewer) again and again what is right or wrong? Would you take the life of a fellow human being you knew knowing you wouldn't be judged because the chains of society no longer binds you? Would you be drunk in power knowing that there is no law to punish you for the wrongdoings that you do? Would you lose self-restraint when the shackles of society no longer binds you? Would you cease to be human when you are no longer bound by society?\\n\r\nWhat would you do if the lives of all the people in the village rests on you shoulder? Would you reveal the truth or wait until the time is right so that you can make everybody move based on their emotion and control them so that you can win? Win, but against whom? Would taking lives to save lives be even human? Would humans no longer be humans after they get used to killing each other?\\n\r\nThe answers of these questions is shown throughout the series in a gruesome way, in the way that humans act based on their emotion, when they stop asking the question to themself \"Is what I'm doing right?\".\\n\r\nA quote from Rentarou from Black Bullet, \"What I'm afraid the most is that I'll get used to killing someone\".\\n\r\nWatch throughout the series where the ethics of people is put into test and people struggle to find the correct answer in a story circling around life and death and re;birth.",

            "content": "(First part of review contains light spoilers)- A refreshing vampire anime that goes back to the tradition of vampires actually being scary- which I vastly prefer over the glamorized, seductive-type vampires seen in most modern media. \r\nIt's hard to find a genre to place this anime into. It is part mystery, part horror, part gothic, even part thriller. The mystery was definitely the weakest part of the show. The first two episodes focus on the death of a girl and what the cause could have been. Of course, there is no real mystery for the viewer as most know going in that it is indeeda VAMPIRE anime. Unfortunately, the first third of the show is rather dull as we see Dr Ozaki trying to figure out what could possibly be causing the vast amount of deaths. It is frustrating seeing him try to work this out for so long and I just wanted him to find out so the show could move on already. REST OF REVIEW CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS.\\n\\n\r\nThe second third consisted of the doctor trying to convince the town that vampires- or \"shiki\", were the cause of the deaths. The scene in which this is revealed however does give an immense amount of catharsis as we see the humans take out a passionate revenge on one of the vampires. The show really picks up pace now as their is virtually an all out war breaking out in this sleepy little Japanese village. The last third of the show is a gripping thriller in which takes place a desperate battle for survival- the vampires wishing to exist and the humans wishing to survive.\\n\\n\r\nI have heard complaints that both sides are too horrible and that there is no one to root for in this show. I disagree. Both sides are terribly flawed and do bad things, and you may find yourself switching sides a few times. I ultimately sided with the vampires after the OVA which displayed human behaviour at it's most barbaric. I'm sure you picked a side eventually also, this show created a lot of debate in it's wake (adding to the enjoyment in my opinion). So yes, whilst I loved the story once it got going, and the OVAs are great also, the first part of the anime was way too slow and it does have to be suffered through to understand the anime unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is OK, nothing to rave about. It is certainly very stylized but I enjoyed it. The hair does look very strange though, out of place I think, and it looks like everyone has some kind of coloured gunk in their hair. The dark eyes to let the viewer keep track of the vampires was a nice touch and helps the series remain coherent. The first OP is very catchy and has a spooky vibe, it kept me coming back through the boring episodes. The second OP is not as good, but luckily the series picked up by then so you don't need it to keep you coming back.\\n\\n\r\nAt it's high points (the OVAs and final third), this series is a masterpiece of thrill and moral dilemma- a solid 10/10, at it's low points, it is very slow and boring. Overall I give this anime a 7/10. It is good, and I think worth being patient to reach the intense conclusion.",

            "content": "Shiki: An elegy of humanity and innocence lost\r\nIn the ever-expanding anime industry, finding your own fix has become somewhat tricky; for quite a while now it hasn't been just anime, but slews of action anime, drama anime, romance anime- you name it. But every now and then, you come across genre-defying series which don't try to fit the bill, but make a point of their own. One such rare treat is Shiki.\r\nYes, it's regarding vampires. No, there's not much cliched cringiness. Now that we've cleared that up, let's get to the plot. The plot itself takes a while to wind up, so it is morethan a bit slow-paced in its first half as you get to know the characters and their ways of thinking, which may seem rather bland and forced at first, but it happens for a reason, as you'll see later on. This is the main Achilles' heel of the series. The story is set in a peaceful, remote village with a tightly-knit community locked in a serene, yet somewhat boring everyday, and introducing viewers to it can be just as monotonous with the story alternating between specific characters' circumstances and the 'main' storyline. Mind you, it did pay off in the end, but that might not be enough of an excuse for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is quite diverse, with plenty of supporting characters switching in and out of focus. Gradually, they are presented with a threat which endangers not only their lives and those of their fellow townsmen, but their whole established way of thinking and morality as well. Both a doctor's cold rationale and a monk's conflicting spiritual approach to the problem struggle to come to terms with the shiki, what they truly are and how to react to them. All of this spirals towards a very memorable, climactic finale, which will leave you completely dumbstruck, even if though you see it inevitably coming. Promise.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the overall thematic, anime such as Shiki are somewhat an acquired taste- if you enjoy thought-provoking stories and don't have a problem with taking the time to think through everything going on, then Shiki is absolutely worth your time. Saying it's a vampire horror story about good and evil does it no justice- think of it rather as a perfect medium to get you thinking. It tackles serious questions such as what is human and what is inhuman? How far can one go against his true nature? Should one be judged according to what they *have to* do instinctively, or what they *try* to do and strive to be? As the town itself becomes inevitably polarized, you will be invited to \"pick sides\" along. Ordinary humans are forced to become demons in more ways than one, but even so may strive to retain their humanity, as both the best and the worst in them seems to transcend death. Demonic humans or humane demons-it's up to you to decide- the show itself forces no opinions either way.\\n\\n\r\nDark visual style with heavy use of contrast, especially at night, and its twisted, bizzare characters work together beautifully to create an eerie atmosphere which increases in intesity as the show progresses. At times, the character design does seem overdone to an extent, the textbook example of this are the infamous rigid hairstyles.\\n\\n\r\nAlso worth mentioning is the soundtrack which perfectly complements the atmosphere from creepy ambience to melancholic overtones. I probably pay attention to soundtracks in anime more than the average viewer, so this was a very pleasant surprise. Haunting tracks such as Eau de Vie and Day and Night are beautifully done and well placed, adding to the emotional weight.\\n\\n\r\nIt's probably safe to say that Shiki is one of those series which are only as good as how much thought you put in them, so if you'd like a fast-paced story to go with popcorn for the evening, you will probably be disappointed. It's not about vampires, it's not about stakes and coffins, and it's not about colorful characters either- it's about how their stories come together and what *you* think about it all. With that in mind, Shiki easily finds a place among the best anime series I've seen.",

            "content": "I hate writing review, but for this absolutely awesome anime, i must write one. Please forgive me, if you don't understand what am i writing as I'm not that good in English and if it's bored you to hell, please stop reading it.\r\nShiki or what do we call it as 'corpse demon'  is a typical story about vampire and werewolf.When I see the meaning, i think it's about a zombie wander in the middle of night, hunting people. Hell no. But, what is so different about Shiki? You must be wondering it must be the same like any typical vampire+werewolf anime/manga where vampire mustlive in a big, classic, old like castle and will always fight with werewolf and happen in a classic old time like Victoria era?Like in Twilight,Trinity Blood and ect? Yup!definitely in shiki you can see all of that, and i bet all vampire and werewolf lovers will love this anime the way i do because it contains all of them.But, what is so different in shiki is that it is mixed with a new element, it's about Japanese vampire or we call it okiagari, \"the risen\",Jinrou or we can call it werewolf. But, what is so different about werewolf in Shiki, is that they are subspecies of Shiki that can wander through days and night, a rare species and what is important is that, they do not fight with the okiagari or we can call the vampires that only can wander during night and sleep during the days. In shiki there are only 4 jinrou ; Yuuki Natsuno(main character),Tatsumi, and the 2 others that name is unknown.To be in fact, when I watch shiki, i came to be so sympathy with the okiagari and thought that the villagers is the villain in this anime instead of the okiagari.\\n\\n\r\nI have known shiki from manga so i decided to watch it on anime version. When i watching it for the first time, i though it was kinda different from manga version. Or no? Well that's my opinion. This anime keep me thinking and thinking, about why it keeps telling what date is it in Japan, lucky day or what ever that i think no one will care.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is so interesting that it always stuck in my mind, and keep me wonder what will happen next in the next episode. The story take place in a modern era,  in a small village called Sotoba. The story began when a mysterious death happened and a series of death came after that the dean of the only clinic in Sotoba village, Okazaki Toshio thought that it was just an epidemic. But,  when the deaths keep piling up, he knows that something is really wrong with the village. He also have a friend, Seishin Muroi, the local priest in Sotoba village. In fact, the Muroi and Okazaki family is the main family in Sotoba village,or can I say the head of the village.They are best friend, but yet have different opinion about shiki. Toshio Okazaki desires to kill all the shiki, yet ironically his best friend give up and went to the shiki family! Together with the main character of this anime Yuuki Natsuno,Okazaki Toshio fight the shiki with their smart plan...\\n\\n\r\nAih, this is boring. To keep it short, i've somewhat disappointed with this anime, because i really want Sunako Kirishiki to die! Despite of her cute look, she is the oldest shiki of them all(about 100 years old?) and sucked out blood of thousand peoples already! and what i don't understand is that, what's up with Mr.Kirishiki? Why he killed his servant and declare that he wants to be a shiki?\\n\\n\r\nAll in all i gave this anime 8/10. Nearly give this anime 7, but i changed my mind, because this anime really give me the excitement mixed with thrilled.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 8/10 because it's a revolution of normal vampire story and the idea is not that original.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 7/10 .The blood is all good, i just don't like this kind of drawing =p\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8/10 . It's the most important in anime.In shiki, the sound is totally creeps me out especially when the time Natsuno is near the window, and the cha cha sound? You know what i mean?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8/10. Yup!all the characters in Shiki deserved it.Yuuki Natsuno and Okazaki Toshio deserved it better =)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8/10. This anime is placed under the tag of horror, mystery anime.With the blood splashing all over at once creeps me out, but at the same time excites me.It's the best horror anime ever!xD\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8/10 because i'm not satisfied with it. It is an incomplete anime. I wonder what happen to Sotoba Villagers and does that mean that not all shiki died?It really pissed me off. or maybe i should read the manga to know what exactly happen?or is it just the same? o_O",

There is nothing erotic or romantic about these creatures, and part of the horror stems from the fact that they are monstrous in the traditional sense while retaining more of their flawed and unattractive humanity than in other fictions. The story is not so dark or philosophical that it's impossible to comprehend. The anime doesn't take itself unnecessarily seriously, but it doesn't cheapen the horror with traditional anime cuteness or humor. This is no Vampire Knight, for instance. \r\nNot the greatest thing ever made, but still solidly different and compelling enough to grabmy attention. The early episodes had enough creep-factor (and sometimes grotesque images to go along with that) that it clearly falls into the horror category, while the later episodes focus more on the physical and existential conflict between humans and the undead. The existential questions and angst are interesting but never really dominate the story as they often do in other Vampire stories. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this is solidly terrifying fun, just gory and creepy enough to really categorize as horror, with enough character development and thrills to keep you engaged even in horror isn't really your thing.",

Through out the story I found myself disliking every characters apart from the jr doctor and the jr monk, but in the final few episodes, a few more characters show parts of themselves that actually make you feel guilty for not liking them. I have to say the ending was the highlight of the anime, although it may have left a hole inside of me it still deserved  a slow clap, it astounded me how it managed tocompletely change my view point of the whole story and all of the characters, by the end I was balling my eyes out. Granted the story did drag on every now and then and it did attempt to make you feel sorry for people you didn't care about, but I still enjoyed it, especially when it would go to the view point of the 'shiki' it made you see what it was like for the vampire, which is quite a unique idea, it really conflicts with your emotions, as you care for the people in the village, and yet you end up resenting them for hurting the shiki and vice versa, this is what really made it a good anime. but like I say the anime does drag on a wee bit, and I found myself nearly falling asleep a few times, but the good parts make up for it. I would definitely recommended this anime simply for the ending.",

The character development, the plot, the pace of the story from start to end, it was all perfect!\r\nNormally I would start off by giving a little backstory to the main protagonist, but honestly, Shiki doesn't like to maintain it's focus on one main character for too long. People who have watched the Anime from start to finish should know what I'm talking about. I'll refrain from any spoilers.\r\nShiki, the story kicks off with a female character by the name of 'Megumi Shizumi' a 15year old girl with freakishly large leg lengths that makes her look like a 20+ year old, and has a shocking resemblance to 'Gasai Yuno' from Mirai Nikki, in more than just appareance... I'm serious.\\n\\n\r\nBack on topic though, Megumi Shizumi, a 15 year old female with bright pink hair and pink eyes. There isn't much too say about her honestly, she's your typical 'highschool girl' if you will. Only has her eyes on the cool, cold-hearted lead male character and is cold to pretty much everyone else. And more than likely spoiled by her parents. Which you can interpret by the clothes she wears. They live in a Village... she looks like she just finished shopping at the damn local Topshop or something. :/\\n\\n\r\nEnough about her though. Slowly but surely, a character by the name of Yuuki, Natsuno Yuuki, gets introduced. A calm and collected, inteliigent lead male Tsundere that likes to keep to himself. He does have a deal of fondness towards another male who he claims to be friends with, Thoru Mutou, the Naruto and Sasuke of Shiki. Except Tohru is 3 years older than Natsuno.\\n\r\nHe gets introduced on the third episode and plays a semi-major part in the series. But he definietly isn't the main focus.\\n\\n\r\nSoon enough as the first episode ends though, a deadly incident happens to one of the characters, which causes some suspicion among the Village folk with what's going on and what caused it. You don't find out much about the reason in the first episode, but soon enough, as the third episode comes, you discover more about a man by the name of 'Tatsumi' which him and his family are apparently moving into a large castle type fort that is placed far over the forests of the Village. We'll refer to this place as the 'Stronghold'.\\n\\n\r\nTatsumi himself is a werewolf, he doesn't get effected by any sunlight, drinking human blood isn't compulsory as he can easily live off human food and beverages and is considerably faster/stronger than the other species that are revealed in this Anime. Which are 'Shiki' basically Vampires, or the 'risen'. They need blood to survive. Human blood to be precise.\\n\\n\r\nI won't say anymore as I may accidentally spoil the series.\\n\\n\r\nWould definietly recommend this to anyone, especially Vampire lovers. These aren't your typical Vampires you see in movies or other Anime like in 'Vampire Knight' These are taken straight from the myth. They don't go by sterotypes like being scared of crosses. But with other exceptions. They can only enter houses and buildings if they are given permission. So they would have to ask them before hand. Yeah, I know, it sounds ridiculous, but it really does make the series more interesting and intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni, I would definietly recommend this Anime. They are very similar. They have the same atmosphere, both set in Villages with a mysterious chain of deaths happening which is yet to be discovered, and both will definietly get you hooked till the very last episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe art really was... 'unique' each character really did have their own unique trait, whether it be there hairstyle or facial features, each individual character really were different. Some in a good way, some in a bad way. But mostly in a bad way. Which is of course my opnion. The only seemingly 'normal' character art were Seishin, Ozaki and Sunako. And that's just boderline, you can tell some of them have some weird art style, but is just enough to pass off as 'normal'\\n\r\nNo hate, just expressing my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and endings, both were amazing in my opinion, then and again, I love nearly all Anime OP's and ED's. I must point out though, perhaps I'm the only one that thinks this, but am I the only one that though the opening made it look more like a survial game Anime? Like, Mirai Nikki or Danganronpa. It's because of how they showed the different characters at 00:04-00:07, they flicked through them like... I don't know, it's hard to explain... it just reminded me of an opening of a survival game Anime. Like they were trying to advitise it like that. Then and again, Shiki does... eh... sort of count as one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give the series a 9.2/10 \\n\r\nSoley because of the character art that made it lose points, but I didn't have the heart to knock it down a full 1. The story and character development were really well done, definetly a solid 10 on story and character devolpment. So 9.2 is my final score.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, don't let me description of the art discourage you, it is definietly a series worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nThank you so much for reading!\\n\\n\r\n[Bare in mind this is my first review, so if I missed any vital points, don't be afraid to PM me and notify me about it. Would be much appreciated!]\\n\\n\r\n-ImChibiKun.\\n",

            "content": "Concerning Shiki, I have to admit that I have mixed feelings about this anime.\r\nWhile watching it, I was convinced that I would give it a 7 or 8, because I really liked and enjoyed watching it. I was intrigued by how the story and the characters had been built up and was looking forwart to seeing how they were going to develop - only to be utterly disappointed.\r\nShiki could have been a really good anime, really. It had lots of potential but, sadly, it hasn't been handled well enough.\r\nThis anime entertained me, got me all excited to the next episodes and I truly had hopedthat it would also continue to doing so until the end.\\n\r\nNaturally, it had his faults and some things I didn't quite like, but every anime has this, but near the end of the anime the quality drastily drops - it's only my opinion though. I had the feeling that all the building ups has been put into waste because they really got me hyped up for seeing their development  but in the end nothing has truly been properly fleshed out.\\n\r\nThis has been the most crucial point for my rating.\\n\r\nFor being honest, it wasn't the ending itself that didn't please me.\\n\r\nFirst of all, it didn't feel like a proper ending at all. It was anything but satsifying. I had the feeling that they just cut the rest of the story away and glued something else there. Perhaps it's also like that, I haven't read the manga yet.\\n",
