            "content": "AnoNatsu is a strange case: a competent JC Staff romance anime, that works as an installment to an old series (the Onegai series), dealing with filmmaking, sci-fi, and summer holidays despite being a Winter 2012 anime. \r\nDirected by Nagai Tatsuyuki (Ano Hana, Toradora!), this anime is a mix of the new and old conventions of romance anime: love triangles, genre fusion, and more.  Kirishima Kaito (Shimazaki Nobunaga), who looks awfully a lot like Jintan from AnoHana, is your average geek interested in using an old film camera he found in the attic. Equipped with various ISO films, he practices cinematography along with his friend,Ishigaki Tetsurou (Ogihara Hideki). Tanigawa Kanna (Ishihara Kaori), a blue-haired Chie from Persona 4, joins to be closer with Kaito while Kitahara Mio (Asumi Kana), a quiet girl, helps out. Looking through the viewfinder, Kaito looks at the running field from his classroom and sees a girl with red hair, Takatsuki Ichika (Tomatsu Haruka), looking lost; his face blushes and we find ourselves watching a silly case of \u2018love at first sight.\u2019\\n\\n\r\nI did not expect much from the work at first: anything by JC Staff, especially the art, these days frightens me. Yet, Nagai\u2019s success in AnoHana shows no declining in this work; the animation quality does not falter below acceptable levels and sometimes astound me in the most dramatic episodes. Its art style is a rehash of AnoHana and yet, I don\u2019t mind; it looks too beautiful. Does this work stop the negative perception of JC Staff? Of course not, but AnoNatsu is undeniably pretty; warm, saturated colors blossom everywhere and the summer season seems almost touchable.\\n\\n\r\nNagai shows his directing skills in AnoNatsu and excels in developing romances. What amazes me is how he puts all those boring, corny romantic scenes and twist it around into something different. Episode 3\u2019s ending features the leads in a train station leaving; the sequence at the end may send Michael Curtiz, the director of the classic film Casablanca, packing. The editing and directing in most episodes are worthy of analysis; Kanna\u2019s subtle gestures, like twiddling her hair, is a curious artistic touch. Anyone who enjoys observing the artistic subtle choices of directors and editors will have a fun time watching Ano Natsu.\\n\\n\r\nAnoNatsu pays homage to the old romance works, especially its parent series: the Onegai franchise. If AnoNatsu goes to a cheese shop, it will be hard to differentiate parmesan and the work; it is after all a tribute to previous works. Romance can be as melodramatic as the ef series or cheesy as seen here. I admire its cheesiness; it\u2019s honest and proud of it. I\u2019d rather see a corny work once in a while than see the same ten melodramatic romance works. While I have not watched any of the Onegai works, it is worth pointing out that there are huge similarities: Yamano Remon (Tamura Yukari) is an almost direct copy of Morino Ichigo and some of the locations are a nod to the previous work too. There is something admirable about the cheesiness and homages AnoNatsu has.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Remon, she and Kanna steal the show. Enigmatic Remon, a senior student, helps out filming and her antics are outrageous. Functioning both as comic relief and supporting character, Remon is an example of how smart a comic relief character can be. She can be seen as the mastermind behind the romances while having fun dipping her toes in the murky waters of love. Kanna, on the other hand, is how tsundere characters should act. Kanna steps beyond the stereotype and her character develops and hardens as the show goes on; she is someone you want to give a hug to. Kanna\u2019s problems is woven inside the love triangles and her frustration and sadness show by the voice actress; I thought this was voiced by a professional, but she is voiced by Ishihara Kaori -- a singer in YuiKaori and somewhat new to the voice acting arena. She is one of the best finds in the anime industry and Nagai uses her skills wisely.\\n\\n\r\n\u201csign\u201d by Ray shows KOTOKO\u2019s songwriting skills in full blast. As any KOTOKO song goes, the sounds of synthesizers undulate their way to your ears. The animation that goes with it doesn\u2019t feel right; at the beginning of the OP, there are some great directing choices:  a film reel shows Ichika smiling and cuts off while the title fades into view. As it goes on though, the animators get lazier and show the characters without inspiration: we see them sitting down, standing, turning around, and a close-up of Ichika\u2019s breasts. It is disconcerting to see a KOTOKO song -- hyper, romantic -- accompany a botched work; this is the only sequence of animation that you can say, \u201cAh, it\u2019s JC Staff.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cVidro Moyou\u201d by Nagi Yanagi -- yes, she\u2019s from supercell -- does a whole lot better. Copying AnoHana, the minimalist ED is beautiful, dancing gracefully with its bittersweet, soothing music. I\u2019m in love with the ED and it ranks up there in my top ten favorite EDs. It\u2019s hard to say much because it\u2019s so perfect. Just watch the damn ED.\\n\\n\r\nIn defense of AnoNatsu, I think it is fair to argue against other reviewers and viewers for one thing: AnoNatsu is not AnoHana; stop comparing them. After hearing talk from both sides of the spectrum, I\u2019ve been raising my eyebrows on any mention of AnoHana when it comes to plot; both works look similar aesthetically, but that\u2019s as far as that path goes. AnoHana is a bittersweet dramatic work that focuses on the aftermath of losing someone precious to you; AnoNatsu is a romance anime. See the difference? A more logical approach: compare AnoNatsu to Toradora!. I\u2019m not a big fan of Toradora!, so I will not go on that route; nevertheless, it is frustrating to see stupid comments on how much \u201cAnoHana is better omfg >:(\u201c\\n\\n\r\nWhat I cannot defend is AnoNatsu\u2019s numerous flaws. People can get irate from the cheesiness; this is, of course, caused by difference in taste and opinion; I think it\u2019s rational to argue in that perspective even if I disagree with it. What I can get behind is the talk on the personalities of the two leading characters: Kaito and Ichika. Their romance is genuine, but they themselves make me yawn. There are so many things going on outside the leading characters\u2019 reach that we don\u2019t really get to know them; instead, we know more about Kanna, Tetsurou, Mio, and even Remon. When problems between the two leads do exist, they aren\u2019t interesting at all -- they bore me. Most of their scenes are lackluster. I was more emotionally invested into Kanna than anyone else. What I say previously is true: Remon and Kanna steal the show.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also an exhausting episode dealing with the most pressing problem in summer: which sexy bras should the girls wear? This episode comes out from nowhere and you ask, \u201cDo you really need a beach episode?\u201d It also introduces other female characters that distract the deeply stemmed love decahedron. While its next episode saves AnoNatsu from being a harem show through Nagai\u2019s ever creative decisions as director, I find the setting of that episode pointless. Most, if not all, beach episodes should just die.\\n\\n\r\nThe last three episodes feel rushed, giving negative vibes to anyone who has watched Angel Beats!. There is a huge amount of compression; AnoNatsu is a work that should have given itself more leeway and needs a few more episodes to make sure its ending makes sense. Episode 11 suddenly speeds up the pacing and it makes you wonder, \u201cAm I watching a different show?\u201d Some of the events presented in the final episodes are unbelievable because of the lack of buildup. For a cheesy straightforward romance show, it has one hell of a time confusing me.\\n\\n\r\nAnoNatsu is imperfect, but it adds to the charm when I think about it. I\u2019m a filmmaker and I know most student films suck. There are lovely shots, but everything else like story is terrible. There is beauty in creating imperfection though; the strengths are worth remembering for and we make nostalgic memories out of filming. We brush away the bad spots and think about the good things that happen; for example, there are scenes that has Kaito filming Tetsurou parodying Ultraman and Godzilla. They know it\u2019s fun and games. There is something magical with the camera rolling when you see your friends acting; the fun of that is presented in the smiling faces of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThose smiles are the purest, untarnished forms of memories.",

            "content": "What happens when you run out of ideas? You take tropes from popular anime and mix them together. Harem? Check. Bad comedy? Check. Bad romance? Check? Love octagon? Check. Then you get Ano Natsu de matteru, the anti-thesis of good writing. A show so creatively bankrupt that it should never be watched by anyone.\r\nThe story starts out with a big breasted \"alien\" girl with glass who comes to earth. She tries to get back to her planet, and until then, she fits in with the humans. Little did she know, the ugliest guy with glasses and a camera fetish develops a crush on her. Shegreatly effects her group of friends. Now if you have seen anohana, clannad, or any litany of other romance shows, you will never need to see Ano Natsu de matteru. It sucks. It does not develop any subplot or character substantially and is a great waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nThe story mostly revolves around glasses guy and alien girl who have an awkward attraction but never speak on it, thus leading to many generic misunderstandings. And then, you have the friends, which concidentally all have crushes on each other leading to predictable drama. The show becomes so banal, so boring, so pointless that you will want to drop it after episode 3.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all very  bad. They are never expanded more than, we like each other. They are bland, boring, subpar and uninteresting. The characters have the romantic chemistry of a dildo and toilet bowl. In other words, they have none.\\n\\n\r\nThis is just a quick review to deter anyone from watching this tripe. Thank you.",

            "content": "\"A picture is worth a thousand words\"; I've never quite believed that saying as much as I did after seeing the last scene of this anime. \r\nAno Natsu de Matteru is an anime about a group of friends spending their summer vacation hanging out and filming a movie. Sounds simple, yes? Not quite. It doesn't take very long for the romance and the drama to kick in, where Ano Natsu is most focused. In fact, that STILL might be an understatement. Within the first 4 episodes, all of the love interests of the main characters are well established and/or heavily hinted at, and there isindeed one hell of a messy love polygon. However, this love polygon is not like most; there is actually a couple that is established (pretty much from the beginning), which ends up leaving every other character stuck in a rut. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most frustrating part of Ano Natsu de Matteru is the fact that the creator seemed to ship his own characters, while disregarding the feelings of everyone else. That leaves a disgusting feeling in many viewers' mouths, including mine. Why establish a love polygon if it is not going to contribute to the plot at all? Honestly, most of Ano Natsu de Matteru was slice of life, more so than romance, and even when there was romance, you were never really in doubt as to who was going to get together. That lack of suspense (especially for a romance drama) is puzzling, to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, I must say that both the art and sound of Ano Natsu are two highly redeeming qualities. Really vivid colors to truly capture the essence of an anime about summer, and a great opening/ending to match the mood throughout the series. The characters themselves are actually really great (especially Remon-senpai, oh that rascal). They'll seemingly always put a smile on your face, no matter who it is.\\n\\n\r\nA respectable romantic drama that is unfortunately kept from greatness by the aforementioned problems, Ano Natsu de Matteru is also plagued with an awkward Sci-fi element that derailed my interest. I think most would agree that including heavy amounts of aliens/robots/lasers in a slice-of-life anime is quite contradictory. That element certainly turned me off, as it made a lot of the scenarios seem so unrealistic. Towards the end of Ano Natsu, I was getting really afraid that the anime was going to have an open ending. Thankfully, that was not the case, and this brings me back to my original point.\\n\\n\r\nThat final scene provided all of the closure in the world to secure a solid rating for Ano Natsu. Up to that point, I was a bit disappointed with how the plot turned out (to say the least), and it left a sour taste in my mouth. The producers completely saved this anime by including those last few seconds. All in all, despite its various shortcomings, Ano Natsu de Matteru is a solid member of the romance drama genre, and gets a recommendation from me for its great characters, art, sound, and satisfying ending.\\n",

            "content": "Considering how Onegai! Sensei went, I was expecting the same because it is of the same author however, I am honestly surprised by this anime.\r\nWhat surprised me was that I was expecting it to be yet another anime close to the harem line where none of the characters will actually get to confess to anybody and the plot will be left hanging at the end of the series. But no. It didn't go that way.\r\nFor a 12 episode series, the anime covered the storyline pretty well despite the short episode allocation and not only that, it wrapped up the relationships between all the characters verywell. Also, I have noticed that recent romance animes will have some (excuse the use of the word, but there are no others to describe it) bullshit like \"Oh out pops a childhood friend from thin air that transfers to the school to complicate matters.\" but for this anime, it surprisingly stuck to it's small cast and developed the relationships between the characters very well.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, the anime is short, sweet and it was a good one with a well rounded ending which is left for the viewers to develop their own opinions of. As for myself, I would say the ending was well-done with the tiniest of hints that the protagonist and the female lead did end up together in the end albeit the events that happened. This is indeed a definite must watch for viewers who want to break away from the general Japanese romance animes where nothing ever gets to anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nFor the ratings, here are my reasons:\\n\\n\r\n8/10 for the Story. Why? Simply because it was pretty much similar to Onegai! Sensei. Normally I would give it a lower rating because of it's lack of originality, however, it was good and sweet until the end that I gave it the rating that it is due.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 for the Art. Why? The art was good. However, the lack of originality yet again by the author by making the characters look almost the same from both series force me to give it an 8 instead of a well deserved 9 or even a 10.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 for the Sound. Why? This is to my own bias. I love piano music. The anime lacked enough music that could have pulled on our heart strings more but since it included piano music, my bias tells me to put a 9 instead of an 8 or 7.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 for Character. Why? The plot was well done and the characters elaborated enough. Should the anime have been a 25 episode series, I'm sure character development would have been much better and would have earned a 9 or a 10.\\n\\n\r\n7/10 for Enjoyment. Why? Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the anime very much. However, I despise endings that does your head in and lets you imagine for yourself. I like definite HAPPY endings. Period. The ending dropped a hint of a happy one at the very end and that's what bumped up my rating to a 7 otherwise I would have given it a 5 or a 6 because... I hate endings that are sad/let's the viewers imagine what it should end like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, apart from the lack of the character design originality and initial story from the author including the \"It's up to you to imagine what happened if I drop this scene here.\" ending, the anime was indeed a very good one and it's an enjoyable watch. Short, sweet and nice. Definitely something worth to give a watch.",

            "content": "Ever seen the anime Onegai Teacher? Ano Natsu de Matteru is basically a remake of that anime. Though its only had one episode I've already compared the characters from each show. So far each one of them is like the other. The only difference between Onegai Teacher and Ano Natsu de Matteru is the alien girl is younger. Instead of being a teacher in Kaito's school, she is a transfer student. Also, Kaito is making a movie. That definitely sets the two anime apart from one another. \r\nStory 8/10 - I give it this score because it feels kind of like a rip off ofOnegai Teacher. Now that isn't a bad thing. The story was pretty good and this is living up to my expectations I've set for it already. I'm drawn in by this story and I hope it continues to amaze me.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10 - I really love this animation style! It totally reminds me of Toradora! Everything is crisp and breathe taking. Definitely gets a perfect score from me!\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 - Ano Natsu de Matteu uses a cute soundtrack. Yes I said cute. It has a good easy going feel to it. Now just because it sounds cute at times it also has the proper music for most scenes. It flows perfectly. Also! The op was done by KOTOKO. That is my number 1 fav when it comes to Japanese Artists. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10 - The reason i've given this an 8 for characters is because again it kind of copies Onegai Teacher's characters a bit. I'll break it down for you as to who I think is like one another.\\n\\n\r\nKirishima, Kaito vs Kusanagi, Kei\\n\r\nThe main character to both of their respective series. Both wear glasses, meet some alien girl, girl becomes close to him because she saved him and moves in with them. Of course it is a bit different for Kei as he doesn't really have Mizuho move in with him, he just gets married to her. Also they both have some rare condition.\\n\\n\r\nTakatsuki, Ichika vs Kazami, Mizuho\\n\r\nThe two are both aliens. Or at least I think Ichika is so far. I could be wrong. Mysterious transfer into the main characters school. Only difference is Ichika is the student and Mizuho is the teacher. Both girls are interested in the main character. They both also have a weird creature that runs their ship and does stuff for them.\\n\\n\r\nYamano, Remon vs Morino, Ichigo\\n\r\nThis is a strange comparison. Unlike the ones I've already discussed, Remon and Ichigo are the same exact character! Every single detail is the same. Both look very young for how old they really are. Both of them have that strange laugh and they pretty much make things go the way they want to. It also doesn't help that they look the same.\\n\\n\r\nTanigawa, Kanna vs Herikawa, Koishi\\n\r\nOkay so they both like the main character. Both of the boys don't really show interest in them. They kind of act the same. Not exactly an exact comparison but they are like each other in some ways.\\n\\n\r\nKitahara, Mio vs Misumi, Kaede\\n\r\nJust like Ichigo and Remon, Mio and Kaede are also basically the same character. Though it seems Mio is more outgoing with the way she speaks about ecchi stuff where as Kaede surprised us with it.\\n\\n\r\nLastly we have Ishigaki, Tetsurou vs Magumo, Hyosuke\\n\r\nThe bestfriend to the main characters. They both are perverted and push the main character into situations they aren't comfortible with. Besides that I don't have anything else to compare between the two.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 - Now just because its like Onegai Teacher doesn't mean i'm going to enjoy it less. This series took off on the ground running like it had a purpose! I'm totally hooked and I know will definitely watch this series to the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 - It's early to give it a rating but right now it feels like a 9 on my rating. I really am taken with this series. Everything about it makes me love it! Please don't disaappoint me Ano Natsu de Matteru.",

            "content": "This Anime is a major disappointment. First off, when I picked up this Anime I simply expected it to be simply slice of life but in the very first episode you have the added twist that two new girls in the group are an alien and someone else with a big secret. The Anime doesn't really flesh that out. In fact, it really doesn't focus on them making the film but instead focuses on the relationships between the characters. Some of the moments were great and enjoyable but other times it felt like I was hitting my head against a brick wall.\r\nThen there is thematter of the art work. In the first few episodes the animation was stiff and not very good. Not to mention the character designs weren't strong either when it came to the main characters. I know the two main characters are supposed to be geeky, but the way they were drawn honestly clashed with the designs of all the other characters who had more details and more realism put into their designs. The sound was all right, but nothing that stood out for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very likable and this is the shows strong point, but it is also why this show is such a major disappointment. We have these wonderful characters with wonderful personalities that just aren't allowed to be themselves. There are times they are stiff and at times the show is over wordy, not to mention painful to watch. Some of the interactions are also just not believable and feel forced. I'll state again, this Anime is a major disappointment for me.",

For me, this was reason enough to jump right on it.\r\n[Story & Character]\r\nIn short: A bunch of strong characters stuck in a lackluster story.\r\nIt's summer vacation and a group of friends decide to shoot a film together. The romances are the focal points here, no pun intended, and the vacation and the film brings all the characters together episode after episode. It's not a plot-driven show. The viewers have to care about the characters and their emotions in order to enjoy watching this. If you're oneof those people who have trouble watching slice of lifes because 'nothing ever happens,' this show is probably not for you.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the character design is unique, they are well voiced, and there is attention to detail even in the minor characters' gestures and behavior. The characters are definitely the strong point of this show, and they almost carry it to success. We care about the characters because we like who they are, but we can't empathize and really be moved by them because, unlike in AnoHana, we don't understand and see where the characters have come from in the past. Even though the characters' feelings and responses to heartache are well crafted, the drama has no history, is unsupported by story presented to the audience that can make them understand the unique and dizzying weight of love, and therefore lacks depth.\\n\\n\r\n[Art & Sound]\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is average -- not so good that you feel particular tracks move you even as you are watching, not so bad that it's intrusive upon the scene. Stock, unoriginal, unobtrusive, average. The anime equivalent of elevator music.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is another standout for this show. The animation is fluid, and even when they are cutting corners, they do it with such artistry that it's hardly noticeable.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment & Overall]\\n\\n\r\nNo doubt that there are moments of brilliancy in this show. When the characters confront each other or themselves in some way, you get the feeling of a great underlying potential. However, this potential is unrealized or drowned out by an excess of unnecessary scenes, beating around the bush, irrelevant storytelling that tries to pass off as character development.\\n\\n\r\nWhile well animated and sporting a cast of wonderful characters -- Kanna, in particular, just makes my heart _melt_ -- AnoNatsu fails in creating the same efficacy of storytelling as AnoHana. I understand it is a different story and deserves a different style, but it lacked elegance and tact in its presentation of this new style.\\n\\n\r\nA 6 out of 10. Which I think is generous, and is mostly for Kanna.",

            "content": "\u201cWe are only truly gone from this world when all memories of us are forgotten, that is true sadness\u201d\r\nAno Natsu de Matteru is definitely one of the more quirky shows I have seen in a while. It is a harem themed show, but its take on humour is a bit different from most other harem shows and as a result it certainly was a thoroughly enjoyable watch. In English it translates as \u201cWaiting in the summer\u201d. The show first aired in Jan 2012 and after 12 episodes, ended in March. It was produced by Sentai Filmworks, who notably have made highly acclaimed shows such asAnoHana and it follows in the same vein as this in terms of themes and art style. This show could be classed under comedy, romance, slice of life, shonen and sci-fi, with the sci-fi element adding that extra bit of quirkiness.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with our main character, a high-school student called Kaito, who is a very keen and passionate mini-film maker. He is always carrying his trusty little camcorder and likes to film the smaller moments in life and those small, fun memories. Pair this with his sticking out hair and glasses and you\u2019ve got a perfectly chic looking film-maker. He has some other friends, together with whom he plans to make a short film over the summer to make some fun memories. All these characters have been friends for a long time and have very typical relationships with each other. There is nothing special to add since they seem a very ordinary bunch compared to most anime friendship circles.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t really an objective to the story of this anime, it\u2019s one of those shows where you can just back and almost observe someone else\u2019s life. This anime is less about its actual storyline, which mainly just includes the friends sorting out their relationships, but more about the feelings it may evoke in different people as the story moves on. The turn of events that tend to unfold are usually quite surprising and while there is no overarching main plot, the show still manages to throw up some quirky situations.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Ano Nattsu de Matteru different from all other such shows with similar themes, is the use of the sci-fi theme and the characters. I\u2019ll start off with the characters, since in a show such as this you can ill-afford a weak casting and with a generic storyline, they are the one of the few highlights you would remember the anime by. The group is comprises of four main characters, Kaito, Tetsurou, Mio and Kanna, the show really starts off when we are introduced to a fifth character, Ichika. Kanna clearly likes Kaito, however the situation changes a bit when Ichika arrives on the scene, you can probably guess the rest. There is also another important character, Lenon, who is introduced early on as well; she attends the same school as the others. She is a quiet but strange character who has a rather mature sense of humour and is also a little mysterious as we don\u2019t get much explanation for her.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the occasional bit of friction, the group are usually functioning well. The show isn\u2019t really split into smaller chunks of changing day-to-day activities, instead it\u2019s broken down into larger segments with each \u201cchapter\u201d having a distinct role to fulfil. In a 12-epsiode show where it\u2019s difficult to really develop a story very deeply, this method of splitting the story up into larger, more meaningful chunks makes the show feel much longer and the characters are done justice. It\u2019s not the kind of show that seems to be over before it\u2019s even started.\\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the part that I\u2019ve mentioned a lot about but haven\u2019t explained, the sci-fi. So far you might be wondering what\u2019s so special about Ano Natsu de Matteru, isn't it just another romance drama and how good can the story and characters really be? Well, the element of sci-fi is actually hinted at straight away in the show from the first episode and it slowly builds up in terms of importance. The normal situations which most dramas tend to have turn into a much more entertaining chain of events thanks to the sci-fi link. In the end, it means perhaps the most bonkers ending to an anime I have ever seen and interspersed in between more serious events, the show really does need this sci-fi element to keep viewers interested. Without this link it really would just be another good show, but it wouldn't give you that nostalgic, special feeling that all great anime do.\\n\\n\r\nI should mention at this point that the use of the sci-fi might not be to all viewers liking. The fact that they\u2019re mixing it in with a romantic drama might take the seriousness off the events. I can understand why some people feel that it\u2019s out of place and in some ways a cop out from making a seriously good middle part to the show. However if you watch it without any reservations from the start and while just coasting along while accepting it\u2019s not all realistic, the show seems to come to life. It gives you that little extra of magic and in the end it helps achieve something that would otherwise be very difficult, even for a normal, full on drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe art-style is very similar to that of AnoHana and other works by the same studio. It has a bright and vibrant feel to it, the colours are made a little brighter and bolder to give that summery feeling. The attention to detail is also sufficiently good enough to convey the atmosphere across. The voice acting was average but it was as one would expect. Sounds and music were again well spread out and used well, nothing spectacular here either. OP was good, however I would like to give a special mention about the ED which was superb and complemented the series and summery overtones really well, easily in my top 5 EDs of all time.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I would like to recommend this show to anyone who likes to just sit back, kick up their feet and watch a show to relax-no deep storylines or tales. This show is more like a wonderfully written chapter in a book, you don\u2019t need the whole story but just a really well done execution.\\n\\n\r\nFor recommendations if you like this show or want to see something a bit similar, as I\u2019ve mentioned before I would recommend AnoHana. They are both similar in terms of art-style and also the summer feel. AnoHana is a much deeper tale and in my opinion much better too, so I would probably suggest watching it afterwards.",

The thing about remakes is that it follows the plot but it doesn't imitate the entire setting and story, in short, it is a complete modification of the orginal show, so that's why we see the chiquita (female lead) being a senior student instead of a teacher and that the muchacho (male lead) isa healthty freshman instead of somebody who's prone to be comatos, but it still follow the same  romatic sotacon arc... you know, mature lady to young boy kind of relationship and there is still the ET girl meeting human boy kind of thing. But unlike \"Onegai Teacher\" this is a pure romance kind of thing with a bit of drama and less of the comic on the sides, so for the stoy, I'll give it a \"Good\" 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nDon't ask.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you'll compare the opening themes of Onegai taecher and this anime they have the same singer which is KOTOKO, end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very start it is obvious that it going to be a Ichika and Kaito arc and that Kanna is gonna be left on the sides..........but, I'll stop here before I get get arrested by the spoiler police (you know who you are), anyway though there a acretain predictability with the charcters, it still deserves a 7 rating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say that it's good all the way, as much as I want to say more, it'll be better to wait for the final episode. \\n\\n",

Oh well, time for the review:\r\nStory: Expect the unexpected with this series. The synopsis says that \"...a group of friends are trying to make a movie.\" so I gave this series a try. It started with a nerdy male playing with his old school camera then suddenly something from the sky fell and, wait-- just watch the show to know what happened next. Just give this show a chance, even two episodes will do.If you drop it after that then I won't blame you but I'm not saying that you won't regret it but rather,  I AM SAYING THAT YOU WILL REGRET IT.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Oh well, as usual, Geneon Universal Entertainment and J.C. Staff never failed to surprise me with their character illustrations. The female lead was drawn so good that I'm amazed by her facial expressions (her smile exactly). Also, the female lead's pet was a little unique. It's so kawaii that I want a plush toy of that pet for myself.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I'll skip this since I haven't really listening to the music part of this series. I focused on the story part. :D\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: So we have a beautiful female lead who is supposed to be from \"out of the country\" and suddenly, she chose to live in a nerd's house. That's everything that I'm gonna tell you since I don't want you to get spoiled. Character development in this series is a bit amazing because everybody's given a chance for love.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: So I didn't dropped this show. After the first two episodes, I got hooked instantly that I always wait at commie fansubs website every Saturday for its weekly release.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: you might call it a cliche but when it comes to love stories, this anime got gold! Like I said, expect the unexpected with this series. You can't go wrong with this.",

The countryside scenario makes the story look very calm and nice of watching.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: The opening and ending plus the soundtrack are the winning points of the anime. They give the rhythm to the plot. The opening is fantastic mixing the calm and soft rhythm with a eletronic beat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: the characters are totally fitted to their posititions inside the plot. They are charismatic characters that makes you keep watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nI recommend this anime without any doubt. It makes you feel lighter after watching. It's a medicine to our souls.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9,6/10.",

            "content": "\"I don't want to be chased. I want to be the one chasing. I want to chase the girl I like\"\r\nAno Natsu De Matteru is a short anime that kept me watching episode after episode. I finished it in a single day. In short: Ano Natsu De Matteru is a story about a group of kids making a summer movie. There's love in the air but I think where this anime excels is the parts in which the use of the filming camera by the main character is used in an intelligent way and where messages about life are present. \r\nStory: 8/10 \r\nThe story getsan 8/10 for me. Nothing out of this world but also nothing mediocre or terribly cliche (though it has its cliche moments). The main plot surrounding the making of the movie is interesting and probably where this anime separates itself from others. There are bits of Sci-Fi in this anime along with a reference to pop culture- which made for slightly comedic scenes. The Sci-Fi bits are well done and it isn't your stereotypical anime when it comes to Sci-Fi cliches. It's well done for what it tries to be. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 7/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nI won't go too into detail about this bit. They have nothing particularly bad or amazing about them. They're above average but I wouldn't say I particularly liked either. The art-style reminded me of Anohana and the sound was decent, but nothing to remember down the line. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well made and actually have decent development for such a short anime. The main character has a likeable awkwardness about him, and most of the supporting characters are also likeable and relate-able. Here are my only issues about the characters: \\n\\n\\n\r\nKaito looks like a nerdier version of Jintan from Anohana, probably because of similar art-style that I've mentioned earlier. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIchika can be a little annoying, especially in the beginning. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMio seems underdeveloped compared to the others. Though that may just be reflective of her quiet personality. It just seems like she got less time than the others on the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI definitely found myself loving and relating to Kanna the most. Tetsurou was also a favorite. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile I loved watching episode to episode, this isn't the most enjoyable anime. There are things that could have been done better, but overall this anime left me feeling pretty satisfied. I'm glad I watched it and I would recommend others to watch it too. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nGive it a watch if you're looking for a slice of life highschool anime with some romance and sci fi involved! The ending is satisfying and I doubt you'll regret watching this.",

            "content": "A work inviting the nostalgic elements of the unforgettable Onegai series, Ano Natsu de Matteru broadens the original idea with surprising dramatic elements, twists on clich\u00e9 comedy, and realistic maturation of stock characters.  This is difficult to do with the highly-abused romantic-comedy genre in 21st century anime.\r\nIn the beginning, the main character, Kirishima Kaito, films the evening sky pondering the wabi-sabi of afterlife.  Suddenly, Takatsuki Ichika, bursts into his empty life with a quirky, sci-fi brilliance.  A summer of teenage passion and emotion ensues, all backed by a camera, questionable beverages, men in black suits, horny siblings and alien invasions.  Ironically,I doubt I\u2019ve surprised anyone so far.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I don\u2019t intend to do so.  What is surprising is that by cramming all of these elements into a half season was actually able to work!  Though it is not difficult to throw a teenage romance into any science fiction, Ano Natsu\u2019s atmosphere is significantly more down-to-earth; it is more like throwing science fiction into a teenage romance.  This style requires a significant plot and meaningful dialogue, as without it the audience would be more inclined to learn all the goodies about aliens and the appeal of space travel.  Ano Natsu survives this potentially fatal topic change by honing in on the simple, clich\u00e9 questions about love and commitment. In the same regard as Onegai Teacher, love steals the stage from science fiction, setting the series apart from either genre.\\n\\n\r\nAt first each character is stock and uninteresting.  The main character emulates the undersexed, over-emotionalized egoist that brands any action by his female counterpart as doing something in consequence of him. I grew weary of him quickly, as this is one of the tenants of a male protagonist in Japanese romance, and it drives me utterly insane. Unexpectedly, this weakness is examined thoroughly in one early episode, and the audience starts to see a more three-dimensional character as the plot thickens throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nIchika resembles Mizuho from Onegai Teacher a bit too much.  I am certain this is partially fanservice to the drooling mob (which I\u2019m included in) that picked up this series.  Her character flaws are typical of a stock heroine throughout the entire series, though she throws a surprise here or there to make her seem more authentic.  Kanna, too, shares typical flaws of her character type whilst throwing a curveball here or there.\\n\r\nI found Mio to be the most unique character, with Remon coming in a close second.  I find it sad that even their characters are becoming a standard in the anime market.  Mio\u2019s actions and interests were kept well hidden, leaving me guessing quite a bit about her.  Remon\u2019s antics and creepy laugh kept me rolling on the floor, preventing the mood from becoming too melodramatic.  Without them the series would have crashed and burned halfway through.\\n\\n\r\nI find now that I only give top scores to experimental animations.  Ano Natsu\u2019s animation stays true to the shape of the Onegai series\u2014no evident increase in the standard size of eyes, consistent body shapes, and simple effects.  Daydreaming scenes add a little haze of glowing colors, and there is diminution of water droplets or goofy eyes which are prevalent in most romantic comedies.  While this is a nice getaway from the standard of this genre, there is little to be breathtaking in terms of artwork.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is reminiscent of KOTOKO\u2019s \u201cShooting Star,\u201d as is the ending to I\u2019ve\u2019s \u201cLove a Riddle.\u201d  Over the years I\u2019ve become an intense music critic, and I cannot say that hardly anything impressed me musically.  The lush pop rhythms and consequential music do give a nice flair to the series, but they are commonplace in today\u2019s anime music.  The voice acting was superb, although I do miss Kikuko-sama\u2019s gentle, mature voice for the female lead (especially in this genre.)  I do find it exciting that the great idol Horie Yui got a small part towards the end of the series, which is perhaps why I am selfish enough to bump the score from as low as a five to a six.\\n\\n\r\n\"Ano Natsu de Matteru\" - though translated as \"Waiting in the Summer,\" is strange gramatically.  \"Ano\u201d usually refers to something in the distance (usually in the past), though the verb \u201cmatteru\u201d is best translated in the present participle. I\u2019ve found no discussion on it, and simply asking a Japanese results in an \u201coooohh\u2026I see\u201d and a smirk to deny clarity on it.  My best guess has to do with a specific time in the past that is presently being \u201crecalled\u201d by Kaito\u2019s narration.\\n\\n\r\nSince I am a fan of this subgenre, I obviously enjoyed it.  This might be okay for those who have significant others, but it would be a big mistake for those who want a colossal plot and complicated characters. Thus, I recommend this to the lovesick, teenage-to-young-adult males who want a few good laughs and gushy romance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSIDE-NOTE: This is my first review on MAL, and I am pleased to contribute after years of feeling uninspired to express my opinion of anime via the internet.  I hope this will be useful for somebody.",

            "content": "Ano Natsu de Matteru is a very strange show. It contains elements that have been done over time again and again. The story seems quite standard: mystery girl from space appears, main character falls in love with space girl leaving behind the short blue haired girl to uselessly follow the main character. You can tell quite a bit about the show from the first episode giving you a clear insight and understanding for this 12 episode series. \r\nIt's obvious that even though there is to be a love triangle going on, Kaito will fall in love with the blue haired girl (because the red hairedgirl is from space and will have to leave by the end of the show). The shy hot girl will fall for the hot guy with glasses, and Lemon will be left to wallow in pity for eternity. I already feell like I've known Lemon my entire life and for this I have rated the story a 6.\\n\r\nIn terms of art and animation I feel that these are very important aspects to anything. That's why I don't watch anything older than 5 years old because animation quality suffered greatly due to technology being very bad. The very simplistic style of the art helps improve the smoothness of the animation making it seem more realistic. In addition, the opening and ending sequences aren't that good. I am giving the art a 9.\\n\r\nNext is sound. If you have ears this will be an easy show to appreciate. I made sure to turn off my monitor while I watched the first episode (the only episode out) again and it was just a whole new experience for me. I felt like I was there with the characters. But the song for the opening is bad and the ending one is okay. I gave sound a 5.\\n\r\nNow we have come to characters. The main character looks exactly like Jinta from Ano Hana. This makes me believe that this is just a parallel universe from that show. The red haired girl, Ichika, shares a name with the male protagonist from Infinite Stratos. I would like her to make me eat it, if you know what I mean. She also has large breasts which is good for any female character in any kind of show. I don't really like the blue haired girl or Kaito's sister. She seems like a tramp. I give the characters an 8.\\n\r\nI kind of enjoyed watching this show while I did. Especially when I turned my monitor off. So I'm giving it a 10.\\n\r\nOverall I think this is a very good show. They should have picked better songs for the opening and ending sequences though. Some people may think that one episode isn't enough to really go on for reviewing and judging a show (or anything for that matter). But that's all bull poopy. You can easily tell that this show may or may not be the best show of 2012 (or even of all time). So if you enjoy watching anime, I would recommend this show to you for sure. If you don't like watching anime, then you may or may not want to watch this show or read anime reviews.\\n\r\n6 is my favorite number so I am going to give this show an overall rating of 6. Now I feel content with this show in its entirety and don't have to watch the remaining 11 episodes that have yet to air. My duty to my fellow anime watchers is now complete for today!\\n\r\nOh, and by the way, read the plot synopsis. It's at the top of the page for this show. You don't have to read the synopsis' that other people write in their reviews because people's opinions are like, just their opinions man.",

            "content": "Coming into the winter 2012 season, I had two definite shows on my radar: Nisemonogatari and Guilty Crown. I tried out a few more shows but noticed I didn't have a romance anime slated in (I try to have one to balance all the action/comedy out). I caught wind of Ano Natsu de Matteru and decided to give it a go. Not familiar with the individual works of director Tatsuyuki Nagai (Anohana) or Yousuke Kuroda (Honey and Clover), or their collaborations (Onegai Teacher/Twins), I dove in. What I came away with after three months was a ride I wasn't expecting; many manly tears were shedin various episodes, and an anime I came in with no expectations ended up becoming my favorite romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nAno Natsu de Matteru really didn't break any barriers or do anything new in terms of storytelling; it was just its execution that really made it a great experience in all its happy highs and heart-wrenching lows. The main character Kaito falls in love with an alien who crash lands on Earth and almost kills him, though he doesn't know that. Yes, an alien. Before you think Ano Natsu is just another cliche \"they're gonna fall in love, and she's going to have to leave Earth\", consider how other animes of this nature are done, and then watch how Ano Natsu progresses. The feelings of the characters and the chemistry between them drives the story, and this works out beautifully. Every episode grips you, not simply because of the subject matter, but because the growth the characters go through is very similar to the love and friendship pains that you and I have experienced in our lives. In the scenes that truly touch your heart (episode 9 is one in particular), you will find yourself smiling and feeling like Kaito (during the happy times) or teary-eyed and distraught (during the sad times). Yes, people usually watch anime to escape reality, but Ano Natsu hits home and reminds you of past loves, or friendships, or the growing pains and conflicts that come with adolescence and falling in love.\\n\\n\r\nAs amazing as the story is to me, I was sometimes disappointed that, yes, Ano Natsu was as cliche as it could get. Granted, often times the story would make up for it, but the fact that you could see certain things coming was a tiny bit off-putting. All in all though, this story will still strap you in a roller coaster of emotions and each episode ending on a cliffhanger will keep you wanting more. This and Nisemonogatari were the two shows that I would be looking forward to all week.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful. The character design is great, but in my opinion, leaves more to be desired. This may be because I'm used to more elaborately drawn characters; however the simplicity of the character design does make sense. The settings are drawn well: beautiful skies that reflect the mood, exquisitely drawn lakes, etc.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Ano Natsu de Matteru is simply amazing. The background music in scenes really accentuates what the characters are feeling and add extra emotion to already extremely emotional scenes. All of that adds up to emphasize the feelings each character in a scene is feeling. The opening \"sign\" by Ray is a decent song to me, but the ending \"Vidro Moyou\" by Nagi Yanagi (formerly supercell's singer) is amazing. An instrumental version of the ending would begin to play at the climax of an emotional scene at the end of each episode, which would ultimately build up to a cliffhanger. It is an amazing use of a peaceful yet emotionally charged song to drive home the emotions of the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThe driving force of this show is the characters and the chemistry that exists between them. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character Kaito is your average high-schooler, a shaggy-haired, thick-glasses-wearing photographer/videographer who ends up maturing faster than I've seen any main character in a romance anime. \\n\\n\r\nIchika, the deuteragonist, is the aforementioned alien, whose shy nature and naive innocence toward love, and eventual lovey-dovey demeanor is portrayed perfectly by Haruka Tomatsu. \\n\\n\r\nTetsurou, Kaito's best friend, seems like a playboy but is hung up on love just as strongly as the next character I will mention.\\n\\n\r\nKanna, Kanna, Kanna. She is Tetsurou's childhood friend and completely head-over-heels in love with Kaito. In my opinion, she is the strongest character in Ano Natsu for all she goes through, but the next character I will mention gives her a run for her money.\\n\\n\r\nMio, who is good friends with Kanna, starts off as the meekest character in the show but eventually becomes one of the strongest and most mature characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's Remon-senpai. The trollest troll character I've seen in awhile. She adds the comedy and entertainment to the all the people in love, by either getting them drunk and egging them to make moves, and in some cases even helps characters get over their fears and self-restraint in order to show their true feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThe love and relationships between the characters creates the emotions, tensions and conflicts that help keep this show's story so heart-wrenching and powerful. Kaito loves Ichika. Ichika begins to love Kaito. Kanna loves Kaito. Tetsurou loves Kanna. Mio loves Tetsurou. Remon looks over this chain of love like a trolling overlord.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a number of scenes that reflect the tensions of love that each character endures, and the one that sticks out the most to me is in episode 2. One can relate to the unrequited love that each character feels, and subsequently feel the turmoil that they do. Even the side characters who only make a few appearances contribute to the plot in major ways.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nLike I said before, there were only two shows that I impatiently waited for and was extremely excited over in the spring 2012 season, and Ano Natsu was one of them. I haven't been this excited over a romance anime since Toradora, and I feel like this surpassed Toradora in terms of my sheer enjoyment of it. I loved the roller coaster of emotions that hit me every episode. I loved the cliffhangers that made me ponder what was going to happen next. It was an amazing experience, and even watching the ending brought me to manly tears.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 (more specifically 9.5/10)\\n\r\nAno Natsu wasn't the perfect romance anime; it didn't break any new ground, but it didn't need to. The excellent writing and execution of scenes, as well as the character-driven plot made this anime go. The emotions of love, happiness and heartbreak that each character felt hit close to home, even if I never fell in love with an alien before. The ending wasn't what I expected it to be, but I still loved it. To me, the emotional ride was similar to Toradora but I actually really felt all the feelings of every scene. I can't say that I felt the same for Toradora (which was my favorite romance anime before I watched Ano Natsu), but I also was constrained from really reflecting on the show due to the fact I was pledging a fraternity during its airing. That being said, I believe that Ano Natsu de Matteru is an experience that every anime fan, whether a romantic or not, can relate to and can love.",

            "content": "Writing this review without making any spoiler is proving much harder than I'd predicted, especially without even mentioning the events in episode 1 or 2, so I suggest you just look at this anime for yourself as my review could well be inaccurate.\r\nHowever, Ano Natsu de Matteru is the example of what experience, wisdom and a solid background in the setting you're using can accomplish.\r\nThe story is certainly among the strong points of Ano Natsu: the plot is enjoyable, fresh and most of all delivered through quite unique narrative devices. However, for how fresh and creatively delivered, I've found it to be a little predictable,which explains the -2 to the otherwise 10.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I'd say art is one of the big guns for this anime: the colours are vibrant, the photography well tought of, and the composition of the sceneries clearly and well planned: while there's no extremely new setting to praise, the outstanding execution of the sceneries is worthy of honors. The exact same goes for Sound: I wasn't emphatic, but I was impressed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization is AnoNatsu's focus, and I'd say it's pretty dead obvious. Considering the stakes were this high, you'd think they'd at least fall short of expectations.\\n\r\nNope.\\n\r\nEach and every character is well defined, even while changing: change's among what makes us human after all, so the ability to keep a character in itself while changing should really, really be praised. Considering this, why didn't I give a 10 to characters? Simply put, I'd have liked to see some more dynamic guys.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't know how much of the anime I was able to convey you without spoilering any part of the story, so really have a look at it and eventually let me know how accurate you've found this review!",

            "content": "i love the animation and i remand using headphones for an awsome sound \"i am not saying that the sound is bad\". AnoNatsu is a strange case: a competent JC Staff romance anime, that works as an installment to an old series (the Onegai series), dealing with filmmaking, sci-fi, and summer holidays despite being a Winter 2012 anime.\r\nDirected by Nagai Tatsuyuki (Ano Hana, Toradora!), this anime is a mix of the new and old conventions of romance anime: love triangles, genre fusion, and more. Kirishima Kaito (Shimazaki Nobunaga), who looks awfully a lot like Jintan from AnoHana, is your average geek interested in usingan old film camera he found in the attic. Equipped with various ISO films, he practices cinematography along with his friend, Ishigaki Tetsurou (Ogihara Hideki). Tanigawa Kanna (Ishihara Kaori), a blue-haired Chie from Persona 4, joins to be closer with Kaito while Kitahara Mio (Asumi Kana), a quiet girl, helps out. Looking through the viewfinder, Kaito looks at the running field from his classroom and sees a girl with red hair, Takatsuki Ichika (Tomatsu Haruka), looking lost; his face blushes and we find ourselves watching a silly case of \u2018love at first sight.\u2019\\n\\n\r\nI did not expect much from the work at first: anything by JC Staff, especially the art, these days frightens me. Yet, Nagai\u2019s success in AnoHana shows no declining in this work; the animation quality does not falter below acceptable levels and sometimes astound me in the most dramatic episodes. Its art style is a rehash of AnoHana and yet, I don\u2019t mind; it looks too beautiful. Does this work stop the negative perception of JC Staff? Of course not, but AnoNatsu is undeniably pretty; warm, saturated colors blossom everywhere and the summer season seems almost touchable.\\n\\n\r\nNagai shows his directing skills in AnoNatsu and excels in developing romances. What amazes me is how he puts all those boring, corny romantic scenes and twist it around into something different. Episode 3\u2019s ending features the leads in a train station leaving; the sequence at the end may send Michael Curtiz, the director of the classic film Casablanca, packing. The editing and directing in most episodes are worthy of analysis; Kanna\u2019s subtle gestures, like twiddling her hair, is a curious artistic touch. Anyone who enjoys observing the artistic subtle choices of directors and editors will have a fun time watching Ano Natsu.\\n\\n\r\nAnoNatsu pays homage to the old romance works, especially its parent series: the Onegai franchise. If AnoNatsu goes to a cheese shop, it will be hard to differentiate parmesan and the work; it is after all a tribute to previous works. Romance can be as melodramatic as the ef series or cheesy as seen here. I admire its cheesiness; it\u2019s honest and proud of it. I\u2019d rather see a corny work once in a while than see the same ten melodramatic romance works. While I have not watched any of the Onegai works, it is worth pointing out that there are huge similarities: Yamano Remon (Tamura Yukari) is an almost direct copy of Morino Ichigo and some of the locations are a nod to the previous work too. There is something admirable about the cheesiness and homages AnoNatsu has.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Remon, she and Kanna steal the show. Enigmatic Remon, a senior student, helps out filming and her antics are outrageous. Functioning both as comic relief and supporting character, Remon is an example of how smart a comic relief character can be. She can be seen as the mastermind behind the romances while having fun dipping her toes in the murky waters of love. Kanna, on the other hand, is how tsundere characters should act. Kanna steps beyond the stereotype and her character develops and hardens as the show goes on; she is someone you want to give a hug to. Kanna\u2019s problems is woven inside the love triangles and her frustration and sadness show by the voice actress; I thought this was voiced by a professional, but she is voiced by Ishihara Kaori -- a singer in YuiKaori and somewhat new to the voice acting arena. She is one of the best finds in the anime industry and Nagai uses her skills wisely.\\n\\n\r\n\u201csign\u201d by Ray shows KOTOKO\u2019s songwriting skills in full blast. As any KOTOKO song goes, the sounds of synthesizers undulate their way to your ears. The animation that goes with it doesn\u2019t feel right; at the beginning of the OP, there are some great directing choices: a film reel shows Ichika smiling and cuts off while the title fades into view. As it goes on though, the animators get lazier and show the characters without inspiration: we see them sitting down, standing, turning around, and a close-up of Ichika\u2019s breasts. It is disconcerting to see a KOTOKO song -- hyper, romantic -- accompany a botched work; this is the only sequence of animation that you can say, \u201cAh, it\u2019s JC Staff.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cVidro Moyou\u201d by Nagi Yanagi -- yes, she\u2019s from supercell -- does a whole lot better. Copying AnoHana, the minimalist ED is beautiful, dancing gracefully with its bittersweet, soothing music. I\u2019m in love with the ED and it ranks up there in my top ten favorite EDs. It\u2019s hard to say much because it\u2019s so perfect. Just watch the damn ED.\\n\\n\r\nIn defense of AnoNatsu, I think it is fair to argue against other reviewers and viewers for one thing: AnoNatsu is not AnoHana; stop comparing them. After hearing talk from both sides of the spectrum, I\u2019ve been raising my eyebrows on any mention of AnoHana when it comes to plot; both works look similar aesthetically, but that\u2019s as far as that path goes. AnoHana is a bittersweet dramatic work that focuses on the aftermath of losing someone precious to you; AnoNatsu is a romance anime. See the difference? A more logical approach: compare AnoNatsu to Toradora!. I\u2019m not a big fan of Toradora!, so I will not go on that route; nevertheless, it is frustrating to see stupid comments on how much \u201cAnoHana is better omfg >:(\u201c\\n\\n\r\nWhat I cannot defend is AnoNatsu\u2019s numerous flaws. People can get irate from the cheesiness; this is, of course, caused by difference in taste and opinion; I think it\u2019s rational to argue in that perspective even if I disagree with it. What I can get behind is the talk on the personalities of the two leading characters: Kaito and Ichika. Their romance is genuine, but they themselves make me yawn. There are so many things going on outside the leading characters\u2019 reach that we don\u2019t really get to know them; instead, we know more about Kanna, Tetsurou, Mio, and even Remon. When problems between the two leads do exist, they aren\u2019t interesting at all -- they bore me. Most of their scenes are lackluster. I was more emotionally invested into Kanna than anyone else. What I say previously is true: Remon and Kanna steal the show.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also an exhausting episode dealing with the most pressing problem in summer: which sexy bras should the girls wear? This episode comes out from nowhere and you ask, \u201cDo you really need a beach episode?\u201d It also introduces other female characters that distract the deeply stemmed love decahedron. While its next episode saves AnoNatsu from being a harem show through Nagai\u2019s ever creative decisions as director, I find the setting of that episode pointless. Most, if not all, beach episodes should just die.\\n\\n\r\nThe last three episodes feel rushed, giving negative vibes to anyone who has watched Angel Beats!. There is a huge amount of compression; AnoNatsu is a work that should have given itself more leeway and needs a few more episodes to make sure its ending makes sense. Episode 11 suddenly speeds up the pacing and it makes you wonder, \u201cAm I watching a different show?\u201d Some of the events presented in the final episodes are unbelievable because of the lack of buildup. For a cheesy straightforward romance show, it has one hell of a time confusing me.\\n\\n\r\nAnoNatsu is imperfect, but it adds to the charm when I think about it. I\u2019m a filmmaker and I know most student films suck. There are lovely shots, but everything else like story is terrible. There is beauty in creating imperfection though; the strengths are worth remembering for and we make nostalgic memories out of filming. We brush away the bad spots and think about the good things that happen; for example, there are scenes that has Kaito filming Tetsurou parodying Ultraman and Godzilla. They know it\u2019s fun and games. There is something magical with the camera rolling when you see your friends acting; the fun of that is presented in the smiling faces of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThose smiles are the purest, untarnished forms of memories.\\n\r\nI found this review Helpful\\n\r\nshow less",

Then you get Ano Natsu de matteru, the anti-thesis of good writing. A show so creatively bankrupt that it should never be watched by anyone.\r\nThe story starts out with a big breasted \"alien\" girl with glass who comes to earth. She tries to get back to her planet, and until then, she fits in with the humans. Little did she know, the ugliest guy with glasses and a camera fetish develops a crush on her. Shegreatly effects her group of friends. Now if you have seen anohana, clannad, or any litany of other romance shows, you will never need to see Ano Natsu de matteru. It sucks. It does not develop any subplot or character substantially and is a great waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nThe story mostly revolves around glasses guy and alien girl who have an awkward attraction but never speak on it, thus leading to many generic misunderstandings. And then, you have the friends, which concidentally all have crushes on each other leading to predictable drama. The show becomes so banal, so boring, so pointless that you will want to drop it after episode 3.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all very  bad. They are never expanded more than, we like each other.

            "content": "\"A picture is worth a thousand words\"; I've never quite believed that saying as much as I did after seeing the last scene of this anime. \r\nAno Natsu de Matteru is an anime about a group of friends spending their summer vacation hanging out and filming a movie. Sounds simple, yes? Not quite. It doesn't take very long for the romance and the drama to kick in, where Ano Natsu is most focused. In fact, that STILL might be an understatement. Within the first 4 episodes, all of the love interests of the main characters are well established and/or heavily hinted at, and there isindeed one hell of a messy love polygon. However, this love polygon is not like most; there is actually a couple that is established (pretty much from the beginning), which ends up leaving every other character stuck in a rut. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most frustrating part of Ano Natsu de Matteru is the fact that the creator seemed to ship his own characters, while disregarding the feelings of everyone else. That leaves a disgusting feeling in many viewers' mouths, including mine. Why establish a love polygon if it is not going to contribute to the plot at all? Honestly, most of Ano Natsu de Matteru was slice of life, more so than romance, and even when there was romance, you were never really in doubt as to who was going to get together. That lack of suspense (especially for a romance drama) is puzzling, to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, I must say that both the art and sound of Ano Natsu are two highly redeeming qualities. Really vivid colors to truly capture the essence of an anime about summer, and a great opening/ending to match the mood throughout the series. The characters themselves are actually really great (especially Remon-senpai, oh that rascal). They'll seemingly always put a smile on your face, no matter who it is.\\n\\n\r\nA respectable romantic drama that is unfortunately kept from greatness by the aforementioned problems, Ano Natsu de Matteru is also plagued with an awkward Sci-fi element that derailed my interest. I think most would agree that including heavy amounts of aliens/robots/lasers in a slice-of-life anime is quite contradictory. That element certainly turned me off, as it made a lot of the scenarios seem so unrealistic. Towards the end of Ano Natsu, I was getting really afraid that the anime was going to have an open ending. Thankfully, that was not the case, and this brings me back to my original point.\\n\\n\r\nThat final scene provided all of the closure in the world to secure a solid rating for Ano Natsu. Up to that point, I was a bit disappointed with how the plot turned out (to say the least), and it left a sour taste in my mouth. The producers completely saved this anime by including those last few seconds. All in all, despite its various shortcomings, Ano Natsu de Matteru is a solid member of the romance drama genre, and gets a recommendation from me for its great characters, art, sound, and satisfying ending.\\n",

            "content": "Considering how Onegai! Sensei went, I was expecting the same because it is of the same author however, I am honestly surprised by this anime.\r\nWhat surprised me was that I was expecting it to be yet another anime close to the harem line where none of the characters will actually get to confess to anybody and the plot will be left hanging at the end of the series. But no. It didn't go that way.\r\nFor a 12 episode series, the anime covered the storyline pretty well despite the short episode allocation and not only that, it wrapped up the relationships between all the characters verywell. Also, I have noticed that recent romance animes will have some (excuse the use of the word, but there are no others to describe it) bullshit like \"Oh out pops a childhood friend from thin air that transfers to the school to complicate matters.\" but for this anime, it surprisingly stuck to it's small cast and developed the relationships between the characters very well.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, the anime is short, sweet and it was a good one with a well rounded ending which is left for the viewers to develop their own opinions of. As for myself, I would say the ending was well-done with the tiniest of hints that the protagonist and the female lead did end up together in the end albeit the events that happened. This is indeed a definite must watch for viewers who want to break away from the general Japanese romance animes where nothing ever gets to anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nFor the ratings, here are my reasons:\\n\\n\r\n8/10 for the Story. Why? Simply because it was pretty much similar to Onegai! Sensei. Normally I would give it a lower rating because of it's lack of originality, however, it was good and sweet until the end that I gave it the rating that it is due.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 for the Art. Why? The art was good. However, the lack of originality yet again by the author by making the characters look almost the same from both series force me to give it an 8 instead of a well deserved 9 or even a 10.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 for the Sound. Why? This is to my own bias. I love piano music. The anime lacked enough music that could have pulled on our heart strings more but since it included piano music, my bias tells me to put a 9 instead of an 8 or 7.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 for Character. Why? The plot was well done and the characters elaborated enough. Should the anime have been a 25 episode series, I'm sure character development would have been much better and would have earned a 9 or a 10.\\n\\n\r\n7/10 for Enjoyment. Why? Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the anime very much. However, I despise endings that does your head in and lets you imagine for yourself. I like definite HAPPY endings. Period. The ending dropped a hint of a happy one at the very end and that's what bumped up my rating to a 7 otherwise I would have given it a 5 or a 6 because... I hate endings that are sad/let's the viewers imagine what it should end like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, apart from the lack of the character design originality and initial story from the author including the \"It's up to you to imagine what happened if I drop this scene here.\" ending, the anime was indeed a very good one and it's an enjoyable watch. Short, sweet and nice. Definitely something worth to give a watch.",

            "content": "Ever seen the anime Onegai Teacher? Ano Natsu de Matteru is basically a remake of that anime. Though its only had one episode I've already compared the characters from each show. So far each one of them is like the other. The only difference between Onegai Teacher and Ano Natsu de Matteru is the alien girl is younger. Instead of being a teacher in Kaito's school, she is a transfer student. Also, Kaito is making a movie. That definitely sets the two anime apart from one another. \r\nStory 8/10 - I give it this score because it feels kind of like a rip off ofOnegai Teacher. Now that isn't a bad thing. The story was pretty good and this is living up to my expectations I've set for it already. I'm drawn in by this story and I hope it continues to amaze me.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10 - I really love this animation style! It totally reminds me of Toradora! Everything is crisp and breathe taking. Definitely gets a perfect score from me!\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 - Ano Natsu de Matteu uses a cute soundtrack. Yes I said cute. It has a good easy going feel to it. Now just because it sounds cute at times it also has the proper music for most scenes. It flows perfectly. Also! The op was done by KOTOKO. That is my number 1 fav when it comes to Japanese Artists. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10 - The reason i've given this an 8 for characters is because again it kind of copies Onegai Teacher's characters a bit. I'll break it down for you as to who I think is like one another.\\n\\n\r\nKirishima, Kaito vs Kusanagi, Kei\\n\r\nThe main character to both of their respective series. Both wear glasses, meet some alien girl, girl becomes close to him because she saved him and moves in with them. Of course it is a bit different for Kei as he doesn't really have Mizuho move in with him, he just gets married to her. Also they both have some rare condition.\\n\\n\r\nTakatsuki, Ichika vs Kazami, Mizuho\\n\r\nThe two are both aliens. Or at least I think Ichika is so far. I could be wrong. Mysterious transfer into the main characters school. Only difference is Ichika is the student and Mizuho is the teacher. Both girls are interested in the main character. They both also have a weird creature that runs their ship and does stuff for them.\\n\\n\r\nYamano, Remon vs Morino, Ichigo\\n\r\nThis is a strange comparison. Unlike the ones I've already discussed, Remon and Ichigo are the same exact character! Every single detail is the same. Both look very young for how old they really are. Both of them have that strange laugh and they pretty much make things go the way they want to. It also doesn't help that they look the same.\\n\\n\r\nTanigawa, Kanna vs Herikawa, Koishi\\n\r\nOkay so they both like the main character. Both of the boys don't really show interest in them. They kind of act the same. Not exactly an exact comparison but they are like each other in some ways.\\n\\n\r\nKitahara, Mio vs Misumi, Kaede\\n\r\nJust like Ichigo and Remon, Mio and Kaede are also basically the same character. Though it seems Mio is more outgoing with the way she speaks about ecchi stuff where as Kaede surprised us with it.\\n\\n\r\nLastly we have Ishigaki, Tetsurou vs Magumo, Hyosuke\\n\r\nThe bestfriend to the main characters. They both are perverted and push the main character into situations they aren't comfortible with. Besides that I don't have anything else to compare between the two.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 - Now just because its like Onegai Teacher doesn't mean i'm going to enjoy it less. This series took off on the ground running like it had a purpose! I'm totally hooked and I know will definitely watch this series to the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 - It's early to give it a rating but right now it feels like a 9 on my rating. I really am taken with this series. Everything about it makes me love it! Please don't disaappoint me Ano Natsu de Matteru.",

            "content": "This Anime is a major disappointment. First off, when I picked up this Anime I simply expected it to be simply slice of life but in the very first episode you have the added twist that two new girls in the group are an alien and someone else with a big secret. The Anime doesn't really flesh that out. In fact, it really doesn't focus on them making the film but instead focuses on the relationships between the characters. Some of the moments were great and enjoyable but other times it felt like I was hitting my head against a brick wall.\r\nThen there is thematter of the art work. In the first few episodes the animation was stiff and not very good. Not to mention the character designs weren't strong either when it came to the main characters. I know the two main characters are supposed to be geeky, but the way they were drawn honestly clashed with the designs of all the other characters who had more details and more realism put into their designs. The sound was all right, but nothing that stood out for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very likable and this is the shows strong point, but it is also why this show is such a major disappointment. We have these wonderful characters with wonderful personalities that just aren't allowed to be themselves. There are times they are stiff and at times the show is over wordy, not to mention painful to watch. Some of the interactions are also just not believable and feel forced. I'll state again, this Anime is a major disappointment for me.",

For me, this was reason enough to jump right on it.\r\n[Story & Character]\r\nIn short: A bunch of strong characters stuck in a lackluster story.\r\nIt's summer vacation and a group of friends decide to shoot a film together. The romances are the focal points here, no pun intended, and the vacation and the film brings all the characters together episode after episode. It's not a plot-driven show. The viewers have to care about the characters and their emotions in order to enjoy watching this. If you're oneof those people who have trouble watching slice of lifes because 'nothing ever happens,' this show is probably not for you.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the character design is unique, they are well voiced, and there is attention to detail even in the minor characters' gestures and behavior. The characters are definitely the strong point of this show, and they almost carry it to success. We care about the characters because we like who they are, but we can't empathize and really be moved by them because, unlike in AnoHana, we don't understand and see where the characters have come from in the past. Even though the characters' feelings and responses to heartache are well crafted, the drama has no history, is unsupported by story presented to the audience that can make them understand the unique and dizzying weight of love, and therefore lacks depth.\\n\\n\r\n[Art & Sound]\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is average -- not so good that you feel particular tracks move you even as you are watching, not so bad that it's intrusive upon the scene. Stock, unoriginal, unobtrusive, average. The anime equivalent of elevator music.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is another standout for this show. The animation is fluid, and even when they are cutting corners, they do it with such artistry that it's hardly noticeable.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment & Overall]\\n\\n\r\nNo doubt that there are moments of brilliancy in this show. When the characters confront each other or themselves in some way, you get the feeling of a great underlying potential. However, this potential is unrealized or drowned out by an excess of unnecessary scenes, beating around the bush, irrelevant storytelling that tries to pass off as character development.\\n\\n\r\nWhile well animated and sporting a cast of wonderful characters -- Kanna, in particular, just makes my heart _melt_ -- AnoNatsu fails in creating the same efficacy of storytelling as AnoHana. I understand it is a different story and deserves a different style, but it lacked elegance and tact in its presentation of this new style.\\n\\n\r\nA 6 out of 10. Which I think is generous, and is mostly for Kanna.",

            "content": "\u201cWe are only truly gone from this world when all memories of us are forgotten, that is true sadness\u201d\r\nAno Natsu de Matteru is definitely one of the more quirky shows I have seen in a while. It is a harem themed show, but its take on humour is a bit different from most other harem shows and as a result it certainly was a thoroughly enjoyable watch. In English it translates as \u201cWaiting in the summer\u201d. The show first aired in Jan 2012 and after 12 episodes, ended in March. It was produced by Sentai Filmworks, who notably have made highly acclaimed shows such asAnoHana and it follows in the same vein as this in terms of themes and art style. This show could be classed under comedy, romance, slice of life, shonen and sci-fi, with the sci-fi element adding that extra bit of quirkiness.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with our main character, a high-school student called Kaito, who is a very keen and passionate mini-film maker. He is always carrying his trusty little camcorder and likes to film the smaller moments in life and those small, fun memories. Pair this with his sticking out hair and glasses and you\u2019ve got a perfectly chic looking film-maker. He has some other friends, together with whom he plans to make a short film over the summer to make some fun memories. All these characters have been friends for a long time and have very typical relationships with each other. There is nothing special to add since they seem a very ordinary bunch compared to most anime friendship circles.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t really an objective to the story of this anime, it\u2019s one of those shows where you can just back and almost observe someone else\u2019s life. This anime is less about its actual storyline, which mainly just includes the friends sorting out their relationships, but more about the feelings it may evoke in different people as the story moves on. The turn of events that tend to unfold are usually quite surprising and while there is no overarching main plot, the show still manages to throw up some quirky situations.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Ano Nattsu de Matteru different from all other such shows with similar themes, is the use of the sci-fi theme and the characters. I\u2019ll start off with the characters, since in a show such as this you can ill-afford a weak casting and with a generic storyline, they are the one of the few highlights you would remember the anime by. The group is comprises of four main characters, Kaito, Tetsurou, Mio and Kanna, the show really starts off when we are introduced to a fifth character, Ichika. Kanna clearly likes Kaito, however the situation changes a bit when Ichika arrives on the scene, you can probably guess the rest. There is also another important character, Lenon, who is introduced early on as well; she attends the same school as the others. She is a quiet but strange character who has a rather mature sense of humour and is also a little mysterious as we don\u2019t get much explanation for her.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the occasional bit of friction, the group are usually functioning well. The show isn\u2019t really split into smaller chunks of changing day-to-day activities, instead it\u2019s broken down into larger segments with each \u201cchapter\u201d having a distinct role to fulfil. In a 12-epsiode show where it\u2019s difficult to really develop a story very deeply, this method of splitting the story up into larger, more meaningful chunks makes the show feel much longer and the characters are done justice. It\u2019s not the kind of show that seems to be over before it\u2019s even started.\\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the part that I\u2019ve mentioned a lot about but haven\u2019t explained, the sci-fi. So far you might be wondering what\u2019s so special about Ano Natsu de Matteru, isn't it just another romance drama and how good can the story and characters really be? Well, the element of sci-fi is actually hinted at straight away in the show from the first episode and it slowly builds up in terms of importance. The normal situations which most dramas tend to have turn into a much more entertaining chain of events thanks to the sci-fi link. In the end, it means perhaps the most bonkers ending to an anime I have ever seen and interspersed in between more serious events, the show really does need this sci-fi element to keep viewers interested. Without this link it really would just be another good show, but it wouldn't give you that nostalgic, special feeling that all great anime do.\\n\\n\r\nI should mention at this point that the use of the sci-fi might not be to all viewers liking. The fact that they\u2019re mixing it in with a romantic drama might take the seriousness off the events. I can understand why some people feel that it\u2019s out of place and in some ways a cop out from making a seriously good middle part to the show. However if you watch it without any reservations from the start and while just coasting along while accepting it\u2019s not all realistic, the show seems to come to life. It gives you that little extra of magic and in the end it helps achieve something that would otherwise be very difficult, even for a normal, full on drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe art-style is very similar to that of AnoHana and other works by the same studio. It has a bright and vibrant feel to it, the colours are made a little brighter and bolder to give that summery feeling. The attention to detail is also sufficiently good enough to convey the atmosphere across. The voice acting was average but it was as one would expect. Sounds and music were again well spread out and used well, nothing spectacular here either. OP was good, however I would like to give a special mention about the ED which was superb and complemented the series and summery overtones really well, easily in my top 5 EDs of all time.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I would like to recommend this show to anyone who likes to just sit back, kick up their feet and watch a show to relax-no deep storylines or tales. This show is more like a wonderfully written chapter in a book, you don\u2019t need the whole story but just a really well done execution.\\n\\n\r\nFor recommendations if you like this show or want to see something a bit similar, as I\u2019ve mentioned before I would recommend AnoHana. They are both similar in terms of art-style and also the summer feel. AnoHana is a much deeper tale and in my opinion much better too, so I would probably suggest watching it afterwards.",

The thing about remakes is that it follows the plot but it doesn't imitate the entire setting and story, in short, it is a complete modification of the orginal show, so that's why we see the chiquita (female lead) being a senior student instead of a teacher and that the muchacho (male lead) isa healthty freshman instead of somebody who's prone to be comatos, but it still follow the same  romatic sotacon arc... you know, mature lady to young boy kind of relationship and there is still the ET girl meeting human boy kind of thing. But unlike \"Onegai Teacher\" this is a pure romance kind of thing with a bit of drama and less of the comic on the sides, so for the stoy, I'll give it a \"Good\" 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nDon't ask.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you'll compare the opening themes of Onegai taecher and this anime they have the same singer which is KOTOKO, end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very start it is obvious that it going to be a Ichika and Kaito arc and that Kanna is gonna be left on the sides..........but, I'll stop here before I get get arrested by the spoiler police (you know who you are), anyway though there a acretain predictability with the charcters, it still deserves a 7 rating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say that it's good all the way, as much as I want to say more, it'll be better to wait for the final episode. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I admit, I'm pretty much skeptical at first when I picked up this show. It was on my 50/50 list (50% drop, 50% pick-up). Good thing the female lead was hot. Oh well, time for the review:\r\nStory: Expect the unexpected with this series. The synopsis says that \"...a group of friends are trying to make a movie.\" so I gave this series a try. It started with a nerdy male playing with his old school camera then suddenly something from the sky fell and, wait-- just watch the show to know what happened next. Just give this show a chance, even two episodes will do.If you drop it after that then I won't blame you but I'm not saying that you won't regret it but rather,  I AM SAYING THAT YOU WILL REGRET IT.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Oh well, as usual, Geneon Universal Entertainment and J.C. Staff never failed to surprise me with their character illustrations. The female lead was drawn so good that I'm amazed by her facial expressions (her smile exactly). Also, the female lead's pet was a little unique. It's so kawaii that I want a plush toy of that pet for myself.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I'll skip this since I haven't really listening to the music part of this series. I focused on the story part. :D\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: So we have a beautiful female lead who is supposed to be from \"out of the country\" and suddenly, she chose to live in a nerd's house. That's everything that I'm gonna tell you since I don't want you to get spoiled. Character development in this series is a bit amazing because everybody's given a chance for love.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: So I didn't dropped this show. After the first two episodes, I got hooked instantly that I always wait at commie fansubs website every Saturday for its weekly release.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: you might call it a cliche but when it comes to love stories, this anime got gold! Like I said, expect the unexpected with this series. You can't go wrong with this.",

            "content": "\"I don't want to be chased. I want to be the one chasing. I want to chase the girl I like\"\r\nAno Natsu De Matteru is a short anime that kept me watching episode after episode. I finished it in a single day. In short: Ano Natsu De Matteru is a story about a group of kids making a summer movie. There's love in the air but I think where this anime excels is the parts in which the use of the filming camera by the main character is used in an intelligent way and where messages about life are present. \r\nStory: 8/10 \r\nThe story getsan 8/10 for me. Nothing out of this world but also nothing mediocre or terribly cliche (though it has its cliche moments). The main plot surrounding the making of the movie is interesting and probably where this anime separates itself from others. There are bits of Sci-Fi in this anime along with a reference to pop culture- which made for slightly comedic scenes. The Sci-Fi bits are well done and it isn't your stereotypical anime when it comes to Sci-Fi cliches. It's well done for what it tries to be. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 7/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nI won't go too into detail about this bit. They have nothing particularly bad or amazing about them. They're above average but I wouldn't say I particularly liked either. The art-style reminded me of Anohana and the sound was decent, but nothing to remember down the line. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well made and actually have decent development for such a short anime. The main character has a likeable awkwardness about him, and most of the supporting characters are also likeable and relate-able. Here are my only issues about the characters: \\n\\n\\n\r\nKaito looks like a nerdier version of Jintan from Anohana, probably because of similar art-style that I've mentioned earlier. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIchika can be a little annoying, especially in the beginning. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMio seems underdeveloped compared to the others. Though that may just be reflective of her quiet personality. It just seems like she got less time than the others on the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI definitely found myself loving and relating to Kanna the most. Tetsurou was also a favorite. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile I loved watching episode to episode, this isn't the most enjoyable anime. There are things that could have been done better, but overall this anime left me feeling pretty satisfied. I'm glad I watched it and I would recommend others to watch it too. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nGive it a watch if you're looking for a slice of life highschool anime with some romance and sci fi involved! The ending is satisfying and I doubt you'll regret watching this.",

            "content": "A work inviting the nostalgic elements of the unforgettable Onegai series, Ano Natsu de Matteru broadens the original idea with surprising dramatic elements, twists on clich\u00e9 comedy, and realistic maturation of stock characters.  This is difficult to do with the highly-abused romantic-comedy genre in 21st century anime.\r\nIn the beginning, the main character, Kirishima Kaito, films the evening sky pondering the wabi-sabi of afterlife.  Suddenly, Takatsuki Ichika, bursts into his empty life with a quirky, sci-fi brilliance.  A summer of teenage passion and emotion ensues, all backed by a camera, questionable beverages, men in black suits, horny siblings and alien invasions.  Ironically,I doubt I\u2019ve surprised anyone so far.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I don\u2019t intend to do so.  What is surprising is that by cramming all of these elements into a half season was actually able to work!  Though it is not difficult to throw a teenage romance into any science fiction, Ano Natsu\u2019s atmosphere is significantly more down-to-earth; it is more like throwing science fiction into a teenage romance.  This style requires a significant plot and meaningful dialogue, as without it the audience would be more inclined to learn all the goodies about aliens and the appeal of space travel.  Ano Natsu survives this potentially fatal topic change by honing in on the simple, clich\u00e9 questions about love and commitment. In the same regard as Onegai Teacher, love steals the stage from science fiction, setting the series apart from either genre.\\n\\n\r\nAt first each character is stock and uninteresting.  The main character emulates the undersexed, over-emotionalized egoist that brands any action by his female counterpart as doing something in consequence of him. I grew weary of him quickly, as this is one of the tenants of a male protagonist in Japanese romance, and it drives me utterly insane. Unexpectedly, this weakness is examined thoroughly in one early episode, and the audience starts to see a more three-dimensional character as the plot thickens throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nIchika resembles Mizuho from Onegai Teacher a bit too much.  I am certain this is partially fanservice to the drooling mob (which I\u2019m included in) that picked up this series.  Her character flaws are typical of a stock heroine throughout the entire series, though she throws a surprise here or there to make her seem more authentic.  Kanna, too, shares typical flaws of her character type whilst throwing a curveball here or there.\\n\r\nI found Mio to be the most unique character, with Remon coming in a close second.  I find it sad that even their characters are becoming a standard in the anime market.  Mio\u2019s actions and interests were kept well hidden, leaving me guessing quite a bit about her.  Remon\u2019s antics and creepy laugh kept me rolling on the floor, preventing the mood from becoming too melodramatic.  Without them the series would have crashed and burned halfway through.\\n\\n\r\nI find now that I only give top scores to experimental animations.  Ano Natsu\u2019s animation stays true to the shape of the Onegai series\u2014no evident increase in the standard size of eyes, consistent body shapes, and simple effects.  Daydreaming scenes add a little haze of glowing colors, and there is diminution of water droplets or goofy eyes which are prevalent in most romantic comedies.  While this is a nice getaway from the standard of this genre, there is little to be breathtaking in terms of artwork.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is reminiscent of KOTOKO\u2019s \u201cShooting Star,\u201d as is the ending to I\u2019ve\u2019s \u201cLove a Riddle.\u201d  Over the years I\u2019ve become an intense music critic, and I cannot say that hardly anything impressed me musically.  The lush pop rhythms and consequential music do give a nice flair to the series, but they are commonplace in today\u2019s anime music.  The voice acting was superb, although I do miss Kikuko-sama\u2019s gentle, mature voice for the female lead (especially in this genre.)  I do find it exciting that the great idol Horie Yui got a small part towards the end of the series, which is perhaps why I am selfish enough to bump the score from as low as a five to a six.\\n\\n\r\n\"Ano Natsu de Matteru\" - though translated as \"Waiting in the Summer,\" is strange gramatically.  \"Ano\u201d usually refers to something in the distance (usually in the past), though the verb \u201cmatteru\u201d is best translated in the present participle. I\u2019ve found no discussion on it, and simply asking a Japanese results in an \u201coooohh\u2026I see\u201d and a smirk to deny clarity on it.  My best guess has to do with a specific time in the past that is presently being \u201crecalled\u201d by Kaito\u2019s narration.\\n\\n\r\nSince I am a fan of this subgenre, I obviously enjoyed it.  This might be okay for those who have significant others, but it would be a big mistake for those who want a colossal plot and complicated characters. Thus, I recommend this to the lovesick, teenage-to-young-adult males who want a few good laughs and gushy romance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSIDE-NOTE: This is my first review on MAL, and I am pleased to contribute after years of feeling uninspired to express my opinion of anime via the internet.  I hope this will be useful for somebody.",

            "content": "Ano Natsu de Matteru is a very strange show. It contains elements that have been done over time again and again. The story seems quite standard: mystery girl from space appears, main character falls in love with space girl leaving behind the short blue haired girl to uselessly follow the main character. You can tell quite a bit about the show from the first episode giving you a clear insight and understanding for this 12 episode series. \r\nIt's obvious that even though there is to be a love triangle going on, Kaito will fall in love with the blue haired girl (because the red hairedgirl is from space and will have to leave by the end of the show). The shy hot girl will fall for the hot guy with glasses, and Lemon will be left to wallow in pity for eternity. I already feell like I've known Lemon my entire life and for this I have rated the story a 6.\\n\r\nIn terms of art and animation I feel that these are very important aspects to anything. That's why I don't watch anything older than 5 years old because animation quality suffered greatly due to technology being very bad. The very simplistic style of the art helps improve the smoothness of the animation making it seem more realistic. In addition, the opening and ending sequences aren't that good. I am giving the art a 9.\\n\r\nNext is sound. If you have ears this will be an easy show to appreciate. I made sure to turn off my monitor while I watched the first episode (the only episode out) again and it was just a whole new experience for me. I felt like I was there with the characters. But the song for the opening is bad and the ending one is okay. I gave sound a 5.\\n\r\nNow we have come to characters. The main character looks exactly like Jinta from Ano Hana. This makes me believe that this is just a parallel universe from that show. The red haired girl, Ichika, shares a name with the male protagonist from Infinite Stratos. I would like her to make me eat it, if you know what I mean. She also has large breasts which is good for any female character in any kind of show. I don't really like the blue haired girl or Kaito's sister. She seems like a tramp. I give the characters an 8.\\n\r\nI kind of enjoyed watching this show while I did. Especially when I turned my monitor off. So I'm giving it a 10.\\n\r\nOverall I think this is a very good show. They should have picked better songs for the opening and ending sequences though. Some people may think that one episode isn't enough to really go on for reviewing and judging a show (or anything for that matter). But that's all bull poopy. You can easily tell that this show may or may not be the best show of 2012 (or even of all time). So if you enjoy watching anime, I would recommend this show to you for sure. If you don't like watching anime, then you may or may not want to watch this show or read anime reviews.\\n\r\n6 is my favorite number so I am going to give this show an overall rating of 6. Now I feel content with this show in its entirety and don't have to watch the remaining 11 episodes that have yet to air. My duty to my fellow anime watchers is now complete for today!\\n\r\nOh, and by the way, read the plot synopsis. It's at the top of the page for this show. You don't have to read the synopsis' that other people write in their reviews because people's opinions are like, just their opinions man.",

            "content": "Coming into the winter 2012 season, I had two definite shows on my radar: Nisemonogatari and Guilty Crown. I tried out a few more shows but noticed I didn't have a romance anime slated in (I try to have one to balance all the action/comedy out). I caught wind of Ano Natsu de Matteru and decided to give it a go. Not familiar with the individual works of director Tatsuyuki Nagai (Anohana) or Yousuke Kuroda (Honey and Clover), or their collaborations (Onegai Teacher/Twins), I dove in. What I came away with after three months was a ride I wasn't expecting; many manly tears were shedin various episodes, and an anime I came in with no expectations ended up becoming my favorite romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nAno Natsu de Matteru really didn't break any barriers or do anything new in terms of storytelling; it was just its execution that really made it a great experience in all its happy highs and heart-wrenching lows. The main character Kaito falls in love with an alien who crash lands on Earth and almost kills him, though he doesn't know that. Yes, an alien. Before you think Ano Natsu is just another cliche \"they're gonna fall in love, and she's going to have to leave Earth\", consider how other animes of this nature are done, and then watch how Ano Natsu progresses. The feelings of the characters and the chemistry between them drives the story, and this works out beautifully. Every episode grips you, not simply because of the subject matter, but because the growth the characters go through is very similar to the love and friendship pains that you and I have experienced in our lives. In the scenes that truly touch your heart (episode 9 is one in particular), you will find yourself smiling and feeling like Kaito (during the happy times) or teary-eyed and distraught (during the sad times). Yes, people usually watch anime to escape reality, but Ano Natsu hits home and reminds you of past loves, or friendships, or the growing pains and conflicts that come with adolescence and falling in love.\\n\\n\r\nAs amazing as the story is to me, I was sometimes disappointed that, yes, Ano Natsu was as cliche as it could get. Granted, often times the story would make up for it, but the fact that you could see certain things coming was a tiny bit off-putting. All in all though, this story will still strap you in a roller coaster of emotions and each episode ending on a cliffhanger will keep you wanting more. This and Nisemonogatari were the two shows that I would be looking forward to all week.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful. The character design is great, but in my opinion, leaves more to be desired. This may be because I'm used to more elaborately drawn characters; however the simplicity of the character design does make sense. The settings are drawn well: beautiful skies that reflect the mood, exquisitely drawn lakes, etc.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Ano Natsu de Matteru is simply amazing. The background music in scenes really accentuates what the characters are feeling and add extra emotion to already extremely emotional scenes. All of that adds up to emphasize the feelings each character in a scene is feeling. The opening \"sign\" by Ray is a decent song to me, but the ending \"Vidro Moyou\" by Nagi Yanagi (formerly supercell's singer) is amazing. An instrumental version of the ending would begin to play at the climax of an emotional scene at the end of each episode, which would ultimately build up to a cliffhanger. It is an amazing use of a peaceful yet emotionally charged song to drive home the emotions of the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThe driving force of this show is the characters and the chemistry that exists between them. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character Kaito is your average high-schooler, a shaggy-haired, thick-glasses-wearing photographer/videographer who ends up maturing faster than I've seen any main character in a romance anime. \\n\\n\r\nIchika, the deuteragonist, is the aforementioned alien, whose shy nature and naive innocence toward love, and eventual lovey-dovey demeanor is portrayed perfectly by Haruka Tomatsu. \\n\\n\r\nTetsurou, Kaito's best friend, seems like a playboy but is hung up on love just as strongly as the next character I will mention.\\n\\n\r\nKanna, Kanna, Kanna. She is Tetsurou's childhood friend and completely head-over-heels in love with Kaito. In my opinion, she is the strongest character in Ano Natsu for all she goes through, but the next character I will mention gives her a run for her money.\\n\\n\r\nMio, who is good friends with Kanna, starts off as the meekest character in the show but eventually becomes one of the strongest and most mature characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's Remon-senpai. The trollest troll character I've seen in awhile. She adds the comedy and entertainment to the all the people in love, by either getting them drunk and egging them to make moves, and in some cases even helps characters get over their fears and self-restraint in order to show their true feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThe love and relationships between the characters creates the emotions, tensions and conflicts that help keep this show's story so heart-wrenching and powerful. Kaito loves Ichika. Ichika begins to love Kaito. Kanna loves Kaito. Tetsurou loves Kanna. Mio loves Tetsurou. Remon looks over this chain of love like a trolling overlord.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a number of scenes that reflect the tensions of love that each character endures, and the one that sticks out the most to me is in episode 2. One can relate to the unrequited love that each character feels, and subsequently feel the turmoil that they do. Even the side characters who only make a few appearances contribute to the plot in major ways.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nLike I said before, there were only two shows that I impatiently waited for and was extremely excited over in the spring 2012 season, and Ano Natsu was one of them. I haven't been this excited over a romance anime since Toradora, and I feel like this surpassed Toradora in terms of my sheer enjoyment of it. I loved the roller coaster of emotions that hit me every episode. I loved the cliffhangers that made me ponder what was going to happen next. It was an amazing experience, and even watching the ending brought me to manly tears.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 (more specifically 9.5/10)\\n\r\nAno Natsu wasn't the perfect romance anime; it didn't break any new ground, but it didn't need to. The excellent writing and execution of scenes, as well as the character-driven plot made this anime go. The emotions of love, happiness and heartbreak that each character felt hit close to home, even if I never fell in love with an alien before. The ending wasn't what I expected it to be, but I still loved it. To me, the emotional ride was similar to Toradora but I actually really felt all the feelings of every scene. I can't say that I felt the same for Toradora (which was my favorite romance anime before I watched Ano Natsu), but I also was constrained from really reflecting on the show due to the fact I was pledging a fraternity during its airing. That being said, I believe that Ano Natsu de Matteru is an experience that every anime fan, whether a romantic or not, can relate to and can love.",

            "content": "Writing this review without making any spoiler is proving much harder than I'd predicted, especially without even mentioning the events in episode 1 or 2, so I suggest you just look at this anime for yourself as my review could well be inaccurate.\r\nHowever, Ano Natsu de Matteru is the example of what experience, wisdom and a solid background in the setting you're using can accomplish.\r\nThe story is certainly among the strong points of Ano Natsu: the plot is enjoyable, fresh and most of all delivered through quite unique narrative devices. However, for how fresh and creatively delivered, I've found it to be a little predictable,which explains the -2 to the otherwise 10.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I'd say art is one of the big guns for this anime: the colours are vibrant, the photography well tought of, and the composition of the sceneries clearly and well planned: while there's no extremely new setting to praise, the outstanding execution of the sceneries is worthy of honors. The exact same goes for Sound: I wasn't emphatic, but I was impressed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization is AnoNatsu's focus, and I'd say it's pretty dead obvious. Considering the stakes were this high, you'd think they'd at least fall short of expectations.\\n\r\nNope.\\n\r\nEach and every character is well defined, even while changing: change's among what makes us human after all, so the ability to keep a character in itself while changing should really, really be praised. Considering this, why didn't I give a 10 to characters? Simply put, I'd have liked to see some more dynamic guys.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't know how much of the anime I was able to convey you without spoilering any part of the story, so really have a look at it and eventually let me know how accurate you've found this review!",

            "content": "i love the animation and i remand using headphones for an awsome sound \"i am not saying that the sound is bad\". AnoNatsu is a strange case: a competent JC Staff romance anime, that works as an installment to an old series (the Onegai series), dealing with filmmaking, sci-fi, and summer holidays despite being a Winter 2012 anime.\r\nDirected by Nagai Tatsuyuki (Ano Hana, Toradora!), this anime is a mix of the new and old conventions of romance anime: love triangles, genre fusion, and more. Kirishima Kaito (Shimazaki Nobunaga), who looks awfully a lot like Jintan from AnoHana, is your average geek interested in usingan old film camera he found in the attic. Equipped with various ISO films, he practices cinematography along with his friend, Ishigaki Tetsurou (Ogihara Hideki). Tanigawa Kanna (Ishihara Kaori), a blue-haired Chie from Persona 4, joins to be closer with Kaito while Kitahara Mio (Asumi Kana), a quiet girl, helps out. Looking through the viewfinder, Kaito looks at the running field from his classroom and sees a girl with red hair, Takatsuki Ichika (Tomatsu Haruka), looking lost; his face blushes and we find ourselves watching a silly case of \u2018love at first sight.\u2019\\n\\n\r\nI did not expect much from the work at first: anything by JC Staff, especially the art, these days frightens me. Yet, Nagai\u2019s success in AnoHana shows no declining in this work; the animation quality does not falter below acceptable levels and sometimes astound me in the most dramatic episodes. Its art style is a rehash of AnoHana and yet, I don\u2019t mind; it looks too beautiful. Does this work stop the negative perception of JC Staff? Of course not, but AnoNatsu is undeniably pretty; warm, saturated colors blossom everywhere and the summer season seems almost touchable.\\n\\n\r\nNagai shows his directing skills in AnoNatsu and excels in developing romances. What amazes me is how he puts all those boring, corny romantic scenes and twist it around into something different. Episode 3\u2019s ending features the leads in a train station leaving; the sequence at the end may send Michael Curtiz, the director of the classic film Casablanca, packing. The editing and directing in most episodes are worthy of analysis; Kanna\u2019s subtle gestures, like twiddling her hair, is a curious artistic touch. Anyone who enjoys observing the artistic subtle choices of directors and editors will have a fun time watching Ano Natsu.\\n\\n\r\nAnoNatsu pays homage to the old romance works, especially its parent series: the Onegai franchise. If AnoNatsu goes to a cheese shop, it will be hard to differentiate parmesan and the work; it is after all a tribute to previous works. Romance can be as melodramatic as the ef series or cheesy as seen here. I admire its cheesiness; it\u2019s honest and proud of it. I\u2019d rather see a corny work once in a while than see the same ten melodramatic romance works. While I have not watched any of the Onegai works, it is worth pointing out that there are huge similarities: Yamano Remon (Tamura Yukari) is an almost direct copy of Morino Ichigo and some of the locations are a nod to the previous work too. There is something admirable about the cheesiness and homages AnoNatsu has.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Remon, she and Kanna steal the show. Enigmatic Remon, a senior student, helps out filming and her antics are outrageous. Functioning both as comic relief and supporting character, Remon is an example of how smart a comic relief character can be. She can be seen as the mastermind behind the romances while having fun dipping her toes in the murky waters of love. Kanna, on the other hand, is how tsundere characters should act. Kanna steps beyond the stereotype and her character develops and hardens as the show goes on; she is someone you want to give a hug to. Kanna\u2019s problems is woven inside the love triangles and her frustration and sadness show by the voice actress; I thought this was voiced by a professional, but she is voiced by Ishihara Kaori -- a singer in YuiKaori and somewhat new to the voice acting arena. She is one of the best finds in the anime industry and Nagai uses her skills wisely.\\n\\n\r\n\u201csign\u201d by Ray shows KOTOKO\u2019s songwriting skills in full blast. As any KOTOKO song goes, the sounds of synthesizers undulate their way to your ears. The animation that goes with it doesn\u2019t feel right; at the beginning of the OP, there are some great directing choices: a film reel shows Ichika smiling and cuts off while the title fades into view. As it goes on though, the animators get lazier and show the characters without inspiration: we see them sitting down, standing, turning around, and a close-up of Ichika\u2019s breasts. It is disconcerting to see a KOTOKO song -- hyper, romantic -- accompany a botched work; this is the only sequence of animation that you can say, \u201cAh, it\u2019s JC Staff.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cVidro Moyou\u201d by Nagi Yanagi -- yes, she\u2019s from supercell -- does a whole lot better. Copying AnoHana, the minimalist ED is beautiful, dancing gracefully with its bittersweet, soothing music. I\u2019m in love with the ED and it ranks up there in my top ten favorite EDs. It\u2019s hard to say much because it\u2019s so perfect. Just watch the damn ED.\\n\\n\r\nIn defense of AnoNatsu, I think it is fair to argue against other reviewers and viewers for one thing: AnoNatsu is not AnoHana; stop comparing them. After hearing talk from both sides of the spectrum, I\u2019ve been raising my eyebrows on any mention of AnoHana when it comes to plot; both works look similar aesthetically, but that\u2019s as far as that path goes. AnoHana is a bittersweet dramatic work that focuses on the aftermath of losing someone precious to you; AnoNatsu is a romance anime. See the difference? A more logical approach: compare AnoNatsu to Toradora!. I\u2019m not a big fan of Toradora!, so I will not go on that route; nevertheless, it is frustrating to see stupid comments on how much \u201cAnoHana is better omfg >:(\u201c\\n\\n\r\nWhat I cannot defend is AnoNatsu\u2019s numerous flaws. People can get irate from the cheesiness; this is, of course, caused by difference in taste and opinion; I think it\u2019s rational to argue in that perspective even if I disagree with it. What I can get behind is the talk on the personalities of the two leading characters: Kaito and Ichika. Their romance is genuine, but they themselves make me yawn. There are so many things going on outside the leading characters\u2019 reach that we don\u2019t really get to know them; instead, we know more about Kanna, Tetsurou, Mio, and even Remon. When problems between the two leads do exist, they aren\u2019t interesting at all -- they bore me. Most of their scenes are lackluster. I was more emotionally invested into Kanna than anyone else. What I say previously is true: Remon and Kanna steal the show.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also an exhausting episode dealing with the most pressing problem in summer: which sexy bras should the girls wear? This episode comes out from nowhere and you ask, \u201cDo you really need a beach episode?\u201d It also introduces other female characters that distract the deeply stemmed love decahedron. While its next episode saves AnoNatsu from being a harem show through Nagai\u2019s ever creative decisions as director, I find the setting of that episode pointless. Most, if not all, beach episodes should just die.\\n\\n\r\nThe last three episodes feel rushed, giving negative vibes to anyone who has watched Angel Beats!. There is a huge amount of compression; AnoNatsu is a work that should have given itself more leeway and needs a few more episodes to make sure its ending makes sense. Episode 11 suddenly speeds up the pacing and it makes you wonder, \u201cAm I watching a different show?\u201d Some of the events presented in the final episodes are unbelievable because of the lack of buildup. For a cheesy straightforward romance show, it has one hell of a time confusing me.\\n\\n\r\nAnoNatsu is imperfect, but it adds to the charm when I think about it. I\u2019m a filmmaker and I know most student films suck. There are lovely shots, but everything else like story is terrible. There is beauty in creating imperfection though; the strengths are worth remembering for and we make nostalgic memories out of filming. We brush away the bad spots and think about the good things that happen; for example, there are scenes that has Kaito filming Tetsurou parodying Ultraman and Godzilla. They know it\u2019s fun and games.

I have one thing to say, this anime is AWESOME.\r\nOne of the best romance anime I've seen. And a complete one too, unlike most romance anime in which stuff isn't sorted out. And that epic ending.\r\nIt's graphics and animation is somewhat similar to Toradora.\r\nThe sci fi part isn't major but it does play a role in the ending episodes and setting of the story.\r\nBut this anime is mostly focussed on romance and relations between friends.\r\nYes, thingsget messed up but it never gets boring. Each episode is awesome.\\n\r\nI'd recommend it to anyone interested in romance anime, you would not regret it.",

When I read somewhere this was a kind of retelling of OneTei I jumped to it, but I did not expected it to go extremely RIGHT on the aspects I did find fault on one of my best loved animes of all time (OneTei). The Art could have been more similar (Onegai Teacher is gorgeous in that aspect) as well as sound which were flawless on OneTei, but Ano Natsu de Matteru is simply delicious to watch and the plot/characters/story is so well doneit made me watch it all at once! I went through it all in one go (after two weeks of training on my job that was a nice relaxing time) and it left me with a satisfaction sometimes not found after watching a series. The MIB references were really hilarious and this series rank among those were relationships are not taken in a shallow, idiotic way. All characters are interesting and not a single one is stupid or really infantile. Actions are taken  with thought and intent, and there is no reasonlless drama like happened in OneTei at its end (the great flaw at the end of that series, although its  manga goes right on that aspect)  Characters are sincere and take real action, not wallowing on stupid, stalling drama and self pity or denying themselves like I saw on other similar series. We see characters going after their dreams and the main protagonists are like us, in their doubts and actions. Ok, at the end the action was offboard, but that was ok with the mood, and the Ichigo counterpart here, Lemon (aha, first a strawberry, now a lemon...nice twist if you get what I mean) was great to see in action.\\n\\n\r\nThe love entanglements were really well done and even a bit surprising with 3 characters, and really well handled. Had OneTei went like this in regards of the love dramas there it would have been perfect...but then it was close to that anyway.\\n\\n\r\n Best of all, the end is what I was hopping for, and on that aspect mirrorred OneTei (I feared it would not be so but then the last scenes were gratifying and cute).\\n\\n\r\nI would like to see an OVA depicting what came after...maybe not a series (not necessary) but an OVA could be nice, with room for some more comedy this time (so much room there, like Ichika's family, the MIB, the Federation....)\\n\\n\r\nI love this little unpretentious Masterpiece and Ano Natsu de Matteru  is for me one of my most loved series!",

            "content": "First thing i would like to say about this anime is it was not at all what i was expecting. I was expecting some half decent romantic comedy where nothing really happens till the end. Some animes like toradora do it right in that sense, but most fail. It also has a really creative way of writing which ill explain in the story section.\r\nStory- As stated before this anime has a somewhat unique/ different way if writing. In some animes there are multiple couples, but the anime focuses on one couple. Which is fine, but i was wanting to try something different for a change.Thisanime does focus on one specific couple which you'll know from episode one, but you also get involved with other couple, some aren't necessarily couple its more like a giant love triangle that actually gets solved and mostly everyone is happy in the end. You actually find out what happens to the sub characters and you find out about their love life and what happens to them. Kaito is the main character of Ano Natsu de Matteru which is apparent right at the beginning. The way this anime opens is just awesome, you can tell almost right away that this is going to be an awesome anime. Along with a strong opening every episode leaves you wanting more. The characters, more than just kaito dont wait around they actually take chances. If they like someone then they actually go after them, and not on the last episode of the anime like some do. Its a refreshing anime in a sense that its story development is different  from what im use to watching and to my knowledge there isn't another anime out there wrote like this one. It also has an incredibly strong ending, and if you stick around past the credits there's a small 10-15 second clip that makes you really wonder if there's going to be a second season. It still puzzles me to this day.\\n\\n\r\nArt- This anime finished airing this year so its fairly new, so as expected this art is going to have the new anime fell to it, really crisp and just great looking. There is some unique designs which i can't really say for fear of ruining the storyline, but it has decent art with some unique designs.\\n\\n\r\nSound- This anime has a really strong intro which for some reason i just really like and i think it fits the anime perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The main character is kaito, he reminds me alot of myself in the fact that he's kind of shy, the nerdy kid that has a few friends, isn't really popular or nothing and has a hobby that he really enjoys. The other main characters are ichika who is a girl ( don't want to ruin who she is so i cant say too much, but shes really important to the story-line) lets just say that she's not what you would expect. Tetsurou who is pretty much kaito's best friend, he's very considerate and just a really nice and fun loving guy, who can be a bit on the dense side like kaito. Then you got mio and kanna who are also kaitos friends, thery're pretty much all of kaitos friends and the main charatcers of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Every single episode had something \"intense\" about it. Intense as in it was extremely funny, emotional or just any kind of extreme emotion. There are the episodes that have you on edge really paying attention, some will make you cry, and others will make you laugh until your sides hurt. I really enjoyed this anime with its compelling characters and story-line.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Overall this anime was really good, unique characters, excellent writing, extremely attention grabbing storyline. This was plain and simply a really awesome anime. Its one that i will definitely have on my mind when talking to people about anime. If you enjoy romantic comedies then this is definitely an anime you should look into.",

This I found an insult to the intelligence. Ok Onegai teacher was about 10 years before Ano Natsu de Matteru but even so.......\r\nInstead of listing all the similarities and giving spoilers to both anime's I'm going to give you a challenge. Watch both Ano Natsu de Matteru and Onegai Teacher and make a list of the similaritiesof both anime's in plot, characters etc. I would think you could get at least 20, give yourself extra kudos if you get more. To start you off:\\n\\n\r\n1. The main female protagonists are both red haired aliens.\\n\r\n2. Spaceship hidden in a lake.\\n\r\n3. Both anime's are based in a rural town.\\n\r\n4. Both main male protagonists are wimpy guys with glasses.\\n\r\n5. There is a very perceptive female friend of the male protagonist who has a secret and looks like she hasn't hit puberty yet.\\n\\n\r\nYou get the idea!\\n\\n\r\nI should say the the characters are stronger and the romance and artwork is better in Ano Natsu de Matteru than Onegai Teacher but like Onegai Teacher I  liked Ano Natsu de Matteru but it just didn't have that X factor that would make me love it. \\n\\n\r\nThe poor mark is more for the screenwriter for rehashing an old formula than the anime itself.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nI say this to a lot of people, but I am a big fan of romance. So, I decided to check out Ano Natsu de Matteru, which seemed to have romance as its biggest draw. In the end, I was pleasantly surprised with what was offered and can't wait for more.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe basic premise behind Ano Natsu is that the four kids of the local high school are looking to make a movie with each other in order to have memories that will last a lifetime. These four kids (Kaito, Kanna, Tetsuro, Mio) become friends with two older students,Ichika and Remon, who, now a group of six, set out to make this movie.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the show revolves around a \"love polygon\" that is somewhat similar to Nagi Asu and Glasslip. \"Somewhat\" because instead of the usual convoluted mess of affections, it becomes apparent very early on that it is more like a \"love line\". This worked for the show fine; it provided interesting scenarios in which the characters had to deal with each other while knowing how the others felt about each other. While not as dramatic as other romance shows, I never felt that the show handled the drama poorly but it was never masterful either.\\n\\n\r\nOther than this, there was never really an overall story arc that took precedent over the unrequited love that is prominent. Now, this isn't necessarily bad considering this show seemed more slice-of-life like.\\n\r\nAs for the ending, I felt it was definitely appropriate and left me with a good sense of conclusion. However, while saying this, there is apparently a second season in the works. Take this for what you will, but it could definitely stand on its own.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nI found the character designs themselves to be fine. Other than the final few episodes, I was never overly impressed by the locales and backdrops. However, the character movements were nicely done and I never felt as if the show used any cheap tricks in order to cut down on costs or what not.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing of note that I found nicely done was the use of the \"old camera\" effect. This made it seem as if I was watching through the characters point of view at that specific moment, and made the show much more enjoyable to watch when it was occurring. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I guess it just made the show seem more real than it actually was.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the characters themselves never see too much growth. While they personally have to deal with the feelings that they have for one another, the show never delves into more complex issues.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the show, Remon basically acts as the facilitator by having everyone do the things that need to be done. This was probably one of this show's strongest points; the characters are never constrained to huge misunderstandings for too long. They all generally confront the things that need to be done in a timely manner, and don't waste time beating around the bush. I liked this a lot, and wish more shows would take this kind of step.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the strongest character from the show was Tetsuro. He had to deal with a lot more pressure than the other characters while concurrently helping those around him.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character interactions, I found them to be enjoyable. There are funny moments, sad moments, conflicting moments; the show does a nice job of putting them through different situations that best bring out their qualities. Furthermore, I never felt that the characters were too trope-y, but these types of romances have been done before, so it should be expected to see similar characters elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nAfter hearing the OP so many times, it gradually grew on me. I don't like it but I don't hate it either. I think contrary to popular opinion, I actually did not like the ED, despite the visuals having a pretty cool effect. Furthermore, I found the rest of the soundtrack to be forgettable which tends to happen with most shows.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the music, the voice acting was nicely done by all characters.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated previously, I am a sucker for romance. Therefore, I enjoyed this show quite a lot actually. Any time there is even a hint of feelings between characters, I get pretty giddy, especially when they start acting in a way that shows they truly care about each other. I am a bit biased, but I think that if you enjoy the romance genre, then you would definitely enjoy this show.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, nothing super dramatic, just a fun romance ride\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, character designs and backgrounds felt right\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, nothing too complex, but enough character background to actually care what happens to them\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, OP was fine but the rest of the soundtrack was not to my liking\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, romance is always nice in my book, and the show did a good job in this department\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "WARNING: This review is only from my point of view, although there are cons apologize if there is a pro thank you.\r\nThere are many users who review \"Ano natsu de matteru\" gives the value of 8-10 and moreover much recommend this anime equivalent of \"Ano hi Mita hana\" which is an my favorite anime, that's the reason why I decided to watch this anime and hope to feel it the same again and find new things about the \"friendship\" but I was wrong. I should compare with the \"Asobi no ike yo\" or \"To-Love ru\" the same time there is an alien and a lovetriangle as well as easy to guess.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many users who say the unique story and to always development, but for me there isn\u2019t progress or a unique story because since episodes 1-3 all the way the story unfolds and the story is similar to the style of the aliens who came to earth and falls in love with protagonist. At first I guess the story that \"Ichika love with Kaito and vice versa, kana who also likes Kaito will struggle to get love from Kaito but failed because Kaito chose ichika \". Apparently the story is just that, a big mistake because of stories like this \"classic\" and has a lot of adapting. Remon's what I thought was a secret agent because she mysterious and seemed to know all the secret characters, it is true. \"Mio obvious that love tetsurou, because she always wanted to be close to tetsurou and wanted to make him happy by saying\" what you will not be lonely if Kanna with Kaito \".\\n\\n\r\nThe director should have slightly changed form of the story, for example, the protagonist who hates aliens and the aliens trying to convince that he is also worthy of love, secret agent should be more energetic and a bit stupid because this is an attempt to hide his true identity. If only it might be applied to any development of the story, a little more unique and there is the impression of surprise.\\n\\n\r\nFor more details, I will explain the reason why I only give the value 4 (bad).\\n\r\nGenre:\\n\\n\r\nComedy\\n\r\nTotal failure, there is almost no humor either words or actions, but at least I can feel a little humor through imagination Kaito and ichika.\\n\\n\r\nDrama\\n\r\nPerhaps this is the genre that had brought the \"Ano Natsu de matteru\" because a lot of drama scenes started coming ichika to earth and falls in love with Kaito, Kanna is trying to express his feelings on Kaito, mio who tried to approach those moments tetsurou and immortalized through film.\\n\\n\r\nRomance\\n\r\nFailed but at least there is something not all that romantic Kaito struggle for ichika could live on earth despite the failure, and even then had a lot of anime classic that has been adapted.\\n\\n\r\nSci-fi\\n\r\nAlien, modern aircraft, strange creatures. That's all well displayed and that too many have adapted. It would be interesting if the alien can be added to bring the character to another planet and see the modernization of another planet earth that is not owned.\\n\\n\r\nShounen\\n\r\nI think this is more appropriate shoujo than shounen, shounen then spoke as if the protagonist (male) strong and has a special ability to protect the other characters. In this anime is all just love to tell about the characters, it was clear the story is more devoted to the shoujo\\n\\n\r\nNow I will discuss the overall\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\n(+)\\n\r\nA remarkable friendship\\n\r\n(-)\\n\r\nmonotonous\\n\r\npredictable\\n\r\nboring\\n\r\nclassical\\n\r\nMany fans of service (harem, big breast, male and female live together)\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n(+)\\n\r\nColoring and lighting is good\\n\r\nOverview of the amazing outdoor\\n\r\n(-)\\n\r\nLess attractive in the character creation\\n\r\nWhereas the lack of CGI Sci-fi theme\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n(+)\\n\r\nFits with the theme of \"drama\"\\n\r\ngood lyrics\\n\r\n(-)\\n\r\nLack of sound effects\\n\r\nInstruments less attractive\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n(+)\\n\r\nNo excessive\\n\r\nSolidarity and loyalty is high\\n\r\n(-)\\n\r\nTetsurou should be the protagonist, because he is wiser and more reliable than Kaito, if tetsurou the main character it will be more lively\\n\\n\r\nThe main character (Kaito) are weak in everything ranging from the act, take decisions, and to the feelings of others. Throughout the episode made a lot of ignorance of this figure.\\n\\n\r\nIchika which has a human nature like the earth to make her role seem unattractive and there is no force in the genre of \"sci-fi\"\\n\\n\r\nKaana who easily give up and doing nothing to make Kaito impressed and realize her feelings of love even as she said, her expression is very flat and clearly rejected.\\n\\n\r\nMio is just a follower of his, as if she was just a walk-on and not fit to be a major figure at least she can make changes to the story.\\n\\n\r\nRemon is not reliable play secret agent, because she has shown since the beginning of the original nature of an agent that is mysterious, intelligent, versatile and most advanced.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nNot at all enjoyed. Since from episode 3 to stop watching this anime because there is not anything that interesting but I am trying to maintain hope as \"Mahou shoujo Madoka Magic\" that could make a breakthrough in the middle of the last episode and make a distinct impression.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nFailed in terms of story and character appreciation, impressed anime classic. There is not anything memorable. Creating memories to make a film that was used to even have a lot of adapting.\\n\\n\r\nAbout Ending\\n\r\nnot currently Ichika go, the narrator says that all the good memories ichika and Kaito and the others will be deleted and not remember anything. But the fact they still remember after many months. Not only is it as ending Ichika by the use of Bolivia, which means that the memory of them is not cleared and ichika can come and go into the earth at will. From here I get confused with the storyline of this anime, it felt too forced.\\n\\n\r\nAdvice\\n\r\nAttendance: you should consider again, if you are a fan of anime or anime unique tremendous better reconsider. But for those of you who like drama or romance would not hurt to try.\\n\\n\r\nDirector: more on improving story and characters. Especially if you can make the story a little different from most anime is similar to the experience of the audience can enjoy the anime.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "My rating for this show after watching episode 11 is different that what my rating became after watching episode 12, which is the finale. This had a very strong ending episode which boosted up the show up a level for me, from a six to a seven. I do recommend this show for anyone interested in a romantic drama, but I won't go as far as too say that this is a must-see for the genre. \r\nLet's start off by acknowledging the similarities that Ano Natsu de Matteru  has with Onegai Teacher. The basic premises is the same, you have a pretty humanoid femalealien from outer space crash onto Earth for no logical apparent reason and joins the educational system to further along their reason. In the case of Onegai Teacher, Mizuho became a teacher ( which made sense with what she wanted to accomplish as her mission) and Ichika became just a regular student ( for no logical reason, I might add). \\n\\n\r\nThose humanoid aliens both make contact with a geeky boy on Earth and they fall in love...in one case, this was done great, and in the other, not so great.\\n\\n\r\nI loved Onegai Teacher, it is one of my favorite shows of the genre and it left an impression on my heart, it is a possibility that through watching Ano Natsu I was reminiscing about the joy and enjoyment I had when watching Onegai Teacher. To put it simply, I think Ano Natsu was inferior to Onegai Teacher in almost every way and category, but I watched it all for the sake of the connection that it had with Onegai Teacher.\\n\\n\r\nWith that put aside, let's start dissecting these categories a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't anything special, there is absolutely no significant plot twist or real surprises. By watching the first episode, you can predict all of the major events in this show. However, I understand that the purpose of this show isn't to tell a great story, but rather to draw the audience's emotions out.\\n\\n\r\nIf this is the case, then yes, Ano Natsu was able to draw out most of the emotions that it intended...not to its fullest extend, but you could feel the emotions of these characters and this is not an easy feat to do.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art was one of the best aspects about Ano Natsu de Matteru, you can tell from the first episode that they weren't careless with the animation. Everything was fluid, the views and sceneries were top notch and gave you a good visual experience to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nNo problem in this part.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nTo me, what separates the great shows from a masterpiece is the ability to move the emotions of a watcher at will. The sound of the show, or the background music, has a significant influence in the ability of a show to move its users. If used incorrectly, the bgm can actually hurt a scene that would have been phenomenal otherwises.\\n\\n\r\nUsually an anime with great bgm is one that is very memorable, meaning that after a show for a while, you can still hum your favorite tune of it, and maybe even remember a scene with that bgm in it. If you can do that, after a few days, week, or even years then that show had supremely powerful bgm music. To this day, I still remember the bgm of True Tears where the main char found out that his lover could be related to him by blood, and then sees her walk past him...I still have that tune in my head, and it has been almost five years since I've last seen True Tears.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is not the case with Ano Natsu de Matteru, none of the bgm really made that much of a difference. This is not to say that the sound was bad or didn't convey emotions well for the show, it is just to say that, off the top of my head, nothing memorable came out of the background music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nKirisihima Kaito:\\n\\n\r\nKaito is the main character, and to put it bluntly, I disliked him throughout the show. He is as clueless as any mc that you will see, he is extremely predictable and is inconsiderate of other people's feeling. He is a selfish MC, and not matter how much his supporting character want to praise him and commend his \"caring\" quality, I havent' been able to find these heroics that they claim that he has. I swear you would think that he is Touma ( from Index) with all the damn praise that his peers give Kaito. \\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, he is not the worst MC that I have seen ( the mc from Suzuka takes the cake for that) or even the nutcase of a mc like the one from school days, no, Kaito is not intolerable but he also doesn't bring any real substance to the story. It is hard to emphasize with him.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the mc from Onegai Teacher, Kei, felt very real and was fleshed out really well. Kei was complex, and though I didn't agree with all of his actions, his train of thought was bearable at worst, and understandable at best.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Kaito a 3/10 as a character.\\n\\n\r\nTakatsuki Ichika:\\n\\n\r\nI wasn't a fan of her character design, and though I had to get over it during the course of the anime, I still really don't like her design. I don't mind the glasses but there was something about her that always bugged me for some reason, I just can't pinpoint that it is.\\n\\n\r\nI found Ichika to be extremely indecisive, to the point that it angered me to see her open her mouth. She was, alot of the time, oblivious to other people's emotion and her own situation in the matter, she would think a certain way..get corrected by her friends...pretend to understand that they were talking about..and later on go back through her previous train of thought. This was extremely annoying, I feel like she didn't progress much as a character, since even in the last episode, she still had doubts about her relationship to her Earthly friends.\\n\\n\r\n Even with this annoying traits, I still sometimes found myself cheering for her and wanting her to be happy, her personality was cute, but probably would have been more effective personally if I enjoyed her character design. That's just personal preference however, I really like Mizuho's design from OT.\\n\\n\r\nKanna:\\n\\n\r\nKanna................oh Kanna, she was doomed from the very start, wasn't she?\\n\\n\r\nI really like Kanna. She's the stronger character of the show in my opinion, and she embodies the growth that I wish I would have seen from other characters in Ano Natsu. I enjoyed watching her interactions and seeing her on the episodes, even though she may have lost the war ( before it was even waged, I might add) oh boy was I still rooting for her. \\n\\n\r\nYou can really tell by the end of the show how much she matued. IT's very hard to not feel at least partially bad fo rher because of how strong, loving and caring of a character she is. She has a good heart, and would make a great lover. If I could, I would go out with her...damn you, stupid laws of physics and computer science...She made a significant percentage of the episodes bearable for me. Her character design made her to be plain looking, but too me her plain lookingness (?) was beautiful. Sometime less is more.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely better than her OT counterpart.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters were pretty generic with nothing really standing out, except for a few minute things, but I won't get to it in this review.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show, no doubt, but as I have expressed earlier, it is possible that a large portion of my enjoyment for this show is just because of the similarites that this had with Onegai Teacher, not because of any particular thing that Ano Natsu has done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is an inferior version of Onegai Teacher, and if you haven't watched Onegai Teacher, then I recommend that you watch OT before watching this pathetic attempt to recreate it. This isn't bad, I'm not saying that at all, but is is lacking in almost every characteristic compared to OT.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of mini cliffhanger in Ano Natsu that make you wonder and click to the next episode, and though you do know how it's going to end, you still want to see how it plays out. Maybe time will help this, but as of right now, it is only good enough..but not great. \\n\\n",

I would have to say I agree with them not saying I have seen them ALL but from what I have seen this takes the crown and was by far one of the most enjoyable series I have ever watched overall  it grabbed me 5 min in and refused to let me go with great enjoyment \r\nSTORY- is an 8 while I am not to crazy about love triangles this anime did one of the few enjoyable ones and in a way I havenever seen before and with a few situations thrown in and some moments you are dying from laughter whether its from Remons laugh or whatever she does  or just frustrated from the desires of the characters to feeling sad at times in the series  \\n\\n\r\nART&SOUND- the art style of this anime is crisp and good looking I found nothing wrong with it detailed and nicely done while the sound was just as good with each characters voice nicely done and fitting each one well and again Remons laugh got me every time to giggle alittle and the opening and ending where a very good fit to the series and putting together a nice setting and environment that the series represented \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER- Was a solid 10 in this field you have a total of 5 people in a love web who are all likeable characters to me which is a rare thing for me and an main character who is not involved in that and with some deep character development and relationships building and falling throughout the show it shines in this department \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT- I would strongly recommend anyone to watch this series as it was possibly one of my fav from 2012 and possibly top 5 of all time as I try and see if it fits there but you will not be disappointed in watching this as it is a solid great anime \\n\\n",

            "content": "I was excited to watch Ano Natsu de Matteru, because it looked like I would like the characters, and even though the plot seemed boring, I decided to give it a chance. But, to me, it was a disappointment. The only reason I even decided to finish the series was because of how hilarious and entertaining one of the supporting characters was. And for that reason only.\r\nSTORY:\r\nIt's boring, I'll admit. There isn't much going on. The only thing \"going on\" is the fact that it's about a group of high schoolers stuck in the midst of a massive love triangle. You know, the whole: sheloves him, but he loves someone else, and that someone else is in love with another person, and that other person is in love with some alien chick. After about 2 episodes, it's pretty easy to determine who is 'crushing' on whom. But what surprised me the most about the whole plot is that we actually got some confessions every couple of episodes, instead of the writers waiting until the last episode and making everyone break down and confesses to their love against the picturesque sunset backdrop. That's one thing I was happy with about this plot.\\n\\n\r\nBut, still, the plot is lackluster. After a few episodes, I found myself saying, \"Ugh, come on!\" And then finally around episode 8 or 9 we get some motion going, but it's kind of too convenient, in my opinion. All of a sudden, we have a dangerous situation that gets resolved in a \"oh wow, that's convenient\" manner...\\n\\n\r\nAll around, plot could have been better and needed some more motion to pick up that feel of dragging feet.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nI loved most of the characters. The main guy, Kaito, is as loveable as a fluffy teddy bear that was rolling around in chocolate; and all the other supporting characters each had their own loveable personalities and quirks, which made me really enjoy their presence on the screen. Especially Remon, the suspicious upperclassman who pretty much forces her way into the group of friends, and takes over the roll of making the summer movie. She is the sole reason why I continued this series, because her antics are so highly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nBut then there is the main girl, Ichika. Oh, how she annoyed me. It's probably just me and my own personality clashing against hers, but she is the main reason why I did not like this series. Pretty much, if you do not like her, then you will not like this show, because who ends up with whom depended on her and her indecisive ways. Further more, she's one of those characters who finds it appealing to constantly apologize for everything that she does, which just added to my dislike of her.\\n\\n\r\nAll around, loved the main guy and the supporting characters; hated the \"heroine\" of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe opening was okay. I only listened to it once and then skipped through it for the rest of the episodes. The chorus was slightly catchy, but nothing fantastic. The soundtrack was nothing memorable, either. Just some relaxing background music that played up the motionlessness of the whole show, in my opinion. I loved the ending, however. Very soothing and catchy. I always looked forward to hearing it at the end of an episode, which is the main point of an ending, am I right? It closed out the episodes quite nicely, if I do say so myself.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nLike I said earlier, this series disappointed me. If the main girl had been more likeable, then I probably would have enjoyed this series more. But I just couldn't. Furthermore, the plot was lacking, and in the end, nothing is really resolved except everyone has a broken heart but they're hiding it like pros. The only reason this gets a 7 is because of one of the supporting characters, which I think speaks volumes about how little I enjoyed this show.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I sound like I absolutely hated this show, I did not. It does have some cute and adorable moments, and I don't feel like I just wasted several hours of my life. However, it's flaws outweighed those cute moments, in my opinion, and overall I would not watch this series again.\\n\\n\r\nLong live Remon.",

Was pleasantly surprised.\r\nAfter watching I went to make a review because this a really well done animation, and I learned that the people who did this also worked on another previous animation and similar story. I have not read this, nor have I watched the previous work. (like I said, I tendto shy away from this genre)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story/plot could have gone wrong in so many way's, but the direction and animation executed this amazingly. Shots are placed and cut beautifully, and the animation (while not SS rank) is great, and kicks up during amazing/important parts of the show.

            "content": "I'm generally not a big fan of anything under the 'romance' label. Doesn't mean that I won't watch it/read it, but it's not exactly what I jump to when I want to be entertained. Ano Natsu, by far, is one of the best romance anime that I've seen. It feels real, even with the alien girl and her spaceship...pet-thing.\r\n(I know that a lot of people have said that it rips off Please Teacher (considering it's from the same writer, I wouldn't be surprised), but since I've never seen that show, I have nothing to compare it to. And I won't.)\r\nStory (9/10): We've all heard thisone- alien girl ends up living with the main character and interacting with his friends. Funny times and romance ensues. But Ano Natsu does it best. The story, while it has it's moments of 'where did that jump in logic come from?', feels like it's about real high school students, not the stereotypes that we see in the majority of general anime. The situations that they end up in are what you would almost expect them to get into. The romance between all the involved parties feels natural and heart-warming/-breaking at the points that it's supposed to. And even in it's more cliche parts, they don't feel like that- they feel almost nostalgic, in a weird way.\\n\\n\r\n(Also it's nice to see a romance develop that doesn't involve the 'oh sorry I peeked in on you while you were naked like seventy times over the course of the show and you hit me for it' cliche. Thank God for the little things, I say.) \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): The series definitely looks good. The character designs are nice and fluid, all of the alien tech looks alien to our setting, the backgrounds look good too. Just good stuff all around, really. The only thing I have against it is that the coloring tends to vary a bit, becoming either too much of one color depending on the lighting of the scene or just being too pale/bright in comparison. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10): The opening theme Sign sounds good, evoking some alien techno sounds throughout, while having a good singer and beat to work with. At certain points throughout the show there's an acoustic version of the opening and it really helps with the scene, so give that a listen as well. The ending was good too, though it's a little slow to me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10): These are the characters you want in a romance- the good guy lead, the charismatic girl he becomes involved with, the girl who has a crush on him but will be his friend throughout, the guy friend who helps move him along to make things happen, the other girl friend who is just a sweetie pie, and the senior that gets involved and is pulling the strings behind the scenes. They all have personality and make you want to root for them, no matter if it ends in happiness or heartbreak. All of them have good chemistry with each other and you really believe that these are teenagers in their first real experience with love.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10): Like I said in the opening, I'm not a romance genre person. But this show felt like something I wouldn't mind seeing again. I was happy to watch the next episode to see where we would be in relation to everyone else and I loved that everything really progressed well. Also the comedy really is too funny in this show. Watch out for the MIB guys! XD\\n\\n\r\nAno Natsu de Matteru may not break new ground in the romance department, but it definitely kicks the genre back into gear, being a heartwarming and funny show that really doesn't get enough credit. Give it a watch if you want a story that doesn't fall into common (now-a-days, anyway) romance traps and annoyances and just let the nostalgia flow through you.",

But noooo of course not, this anime just had to leave the best cliff hangers EVER and forced me to watch.... but truly, this was a great anime.\r\nIt's hard really, to explain it, but it has that Toradora feel to it, you know at the beginning of the episode? When delinquent looking dude and taiga were talking like as if they came from the future, yeah, Ano Natsu has that mostly towards the beginning and I like that kind of stuff. It adds a psychological viewon the anime and a sort of suspense that you can look back upon once the anime is over.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I liked about this anime is that the romance had a progressive flow, it didn't just take a halt and you know WAIT TILL THE LAST EPISODE JUST FOR A CONFESSION... just had to get that out there. At the same time it feels very natural though, like as if nothing was contrived or forced, well, maybe a little.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime will get you laughing crying smiling kyaaaaing and many things will happen to you. Apparently yall like summaries so here's mine; This boy has a camera, he meets this girl and it's nearly love at first sight, she has a secret about her though! It involves this boy and blah blah JUST WATCH THE ANIME ALREADY.\\n\\n\r\n*Recommended for those who are looking for a light hearted deep plot but also a turn off your thinking caps lovey dovey story with a combo of anohana and toradora, cus you know, those guys who made those animes made this anime. This anime had sad parts but also a happy side perfectly combining the two and I promise, you will be left satisfied to the end of this very short but amazing anime.* (It's so short just watch it already, oh yea one more thing.)\\n\\n\r\nRemember how I told you about all those cliff hangers and such? If you're an anime fan like me that just can't stand to leave the anime at a point like that and must watch the next episode at hand, make sure you have 7 hours straight on your hand cus this anime just gave me a D in Biology, PEACE OUT",

If you enjoyed Angel Beats and/or Clannad, you'll love this anime. It's a story about a group of friends who decide to film a movie together. Like any drama anime, there are love triangles and, well, drama.\r\n But it's all done right, in my opinion.There are hardly any misunderstands, and if there are the characters sort it out within five minutes instead of over whole episodes, which is refreshing. The characters feelings and actions aren't forcedand realistic. The story moves along at the appropriate speed. Nothing seems too fast and the plot is spread out over all the episodes instead of being forced into the last few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nNot only are the characters and story well done, but the art style is very good. The characters are very well designed and distinctive. Not to mention, everyone is cute.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ano Natsu de Matteru is a short, well-paced anime with interesting characters, story, and art style. I highly recommend to any anime-fan who enjoys the drama genre!",

The two beach episodes could easily be dropped and the only two events that seem to happen in them would fit elsewere. There's even a festival with yukatas and impossible-to-catch fishes which do not add very much to all.\r\nThings can get a bit tiring as you see that there are a number of scenes which are telling you the same continuously. Something was told to me four times at the beginning of episode eleven.\r\nCharacters are pretty plain appart fromtheir love affairs. It seems their only hobby is being in love and not doing anything. One of them seems to build models, but he could have been watching TV and nothing would have changed. Particulary the female protagonist seems preety dull for an extraterrestrial being capable of space travel. And... why is she wearing glasses? Duh.\\n\\n\r\nEven the mascot is pretty average.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the best character is the less visible: Yamano Remon. Seems to be the only one hiding something and has the most personality of them all, even if it is for being somewhat evil.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the last two episodes are slightly enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, having some love stories, the resolution for most of them is... mostly void.",

            "content": "I'm an 18 year old man but I will admit to shedding some tears from this anime.\r\nAno Natsu de Matteru will take you through a very standard anime style story while adding an incredible amount of Depth. It blew me away and has become one of my favourite animes.\r\nStory: The story is amazing. It begins and ends on the most hyped moments for each episode and the inbetween builds up well for the climax of the episode as well. Its like being hit with three big wows for every episode. Something you don't get alot of with this type of anime. The story actually goessomewhere in terms of romance as well. The whole concept of the film making is not very tangible besides the fact that its what gets everyone together, but later on in the series it becomes more clear what filming and the movie symbolises. 10/10 for story, it brought something new to the slice of life romance anime and it moved quite fluidly.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art was outstanding. I love the kind of artwork that this anime brings. I can only maybe compare it to Chuunibiyou another one of my all time favs. Its not an old style of anime art which is nice and the drawings are crisp and modern. Overall enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is one of the main feels catchers. The music will have you wanting to join in on the excitement or feel the pain of the characters as well. It was climatic and cinematic as well as being soft on the ears too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Probably my own gripe with the show is that you never really end up seeing what happens to Tetsuro and Mio or even Kanna in fact. I wish Kanna would have made peace with her rejection from Kaito but thats just me. Overall the character ark was good but the story itself really carried the anime not the character development. Kaito was a pretty bland guy but I do like how he was somewhat different the typical anime protaganists in SOME ways. The characters are well done just not the best but again the story really carried this anime. Voice acting Japanese dub was excellent though i have to say.\\n\\n\r\nITS A GREAT ANIME WHICH WILL MAKE YOU CATCH THE FEELS. Its so short that you will not sleep the night you finish it. Like all great animes you will feel a hole in your heart and thats just how it goes. But if you have that hole right now then please take a look at this anime and prepare for one epic journey :) cheers.",

            "content": "My wife said, \"I enjoyed this. You should watch it.\" All she told me was there was an alien and these kids were trying to make a film. And that the show tells a story and wraps it up nicely, which is something I appreciate a lot. I can't stand it when it's clear the writers have no idea where they're going and they're just trying to see how many seasons they can get approved for.\r\nAnyway, episode 1...\r\nThe OP was terrible. It was just a bunch of kids not doing anything except smiling at each other. There was no hint of who they were orwhat kind of show it was. But, some shows have bad OPs and I wasn't going to judge. Turns out I was wrong and the OP was spot on, but I didn't know that yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe episode itself was tedious. There's no other way to put it. I couldn't wait for it to end. Every time the camera panned to the sky I hoped that was the end, but it wasn't. No one said anything with any meaning or weight. No one exuded any personality beyond tropes. OK, there's the tsundere one, there's the moe one, there's a chunibyo I guess? And main character lives alone with his big sister and then invites this girl he's been stalking to live at his house and I guess we're in for a harem. The only thing that happens in this whole episode is right at the end and I saw it coming from a mile away and yep it's totally a harem show.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not trying to be smug here. The second the tsundere randomly ran into the sister downtown I literally said out loud \"These guys are gonna walk in on those other guys in a compromising position.\"\\n\\n\r\nSo first episode we're given 6 characters with no history or interests or personality except for clich\u00e9d tropes. See what I mean about the OP being spot on? The reason the characters do nothing but smile at each other the whole OP is because they are lifeless trope balloons. Grab a tsundere balloon, inflate it, tape it on a bench. Grab a ditzy-fish-out-of-water balloon, and tape it up next to the cardboard cut out of a guy. The slight breeze blowing by will make everything sway around giving the illusion of life.\\n\\n\r\nJust really boring, lifeless, bleh.\\n\\n\r\nAfter some heated discussion with my wife, and seeing the show well rated here, I pushed myself to watch a second episode. After all, some shows need to warm up.\\n\\n\r\nNope, it got worse. I couldn't even get through two lines without snarking about how empty the writing was. They just say nothing about nothing. One character asks, \"Why is she moving it with you?\" and honestly the response should have been, \"Because we're in an anime, stupid. Did you notice the red hair?\" At least we seem to have moved out of the harem zone because the sister, instead of getting over-protective, all but says \"OK, you two get married and live here and I'll go live somewhere else.\"\\n\\n\r\nOther complaints... \\n\\n\r\nThe constant theme of \"I kind of remember something but I don't know what\" coming from both of the main characters, combined with the sunny, washed out art, kept reminding me of \"Your Name\", which was actually good.\\n\\n\r\nMy wife said you learn so much about the characters over the course of the show, and maybe she's right, but you can't start from zero and expect viewers to stick around. We know literally nothing about these people. What kind of students are they? Do they have any hobbies? How long do they all know each other? What do they want? Or what do they THINK they want? Do any of them actually know anything about making a film? Do they take film classes? Do they like watching movies together? I  have no idea.\\n\\n\r\nIn one scene, tall guy says the chunibyo girl is in charge of the movie so then she pulls out a script and starts talking enthusiastically about it and immediately tall guy says that's dumb let's do something else and everyone else starts brainstorming ideas and this doesn't bother the chunibyo girl AT ALL! She was put in charge and then is shut down and she doesn't have any emotional reaction to this at all. That's because, remember, she's just a balloon blowing in a gentle breeze. They all are.\\n\\n\r\nI felt like I was watching some very ordinary people I didn't know because we just happened to be at the same place at the same time. Like if I was waiting for a train to arrive and I had to be there waiting and I was kinda bored so I just watched those people over there goof around until the train finally arrives and I can get up and get on with my life and not think about those people again. That's a thing that happens in real life, but I wouldn't make an anime about it.\\n\\n\r\nA story needs to engage me right away, make me care about what I'm watching, give me a reason to keep watching. This was really beginner level writing, just a string of empty words and hollow tropes. I absolutely could not bear to watch another episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I realize this review is not that insightful. It's my first one. As I do more of these, I hope to develop a more robust language to dissect and describe what I'm seeing.",

            "content": "I did a bit of research before watching this anime and after finding out that this anime was directed by the same guy who directed \"AnoHana: The Flower We Say That Day\", I got excited. Too excited, perhaps because I thought this was going to be another drama. Turns out, it was another one of those Rom-Com anime. \r\n[Story]: (7/10)\r\nDuring summer, a group of friends decided to make a movie. However, while making the movie, they end up learning more about their feelings towards each other. What begins as a simple way to avoid the summer doldrums quickly turns into something much more complex, intimateand revealing\\n\\n\r\nThe story is basically a young high school teenager called Kaito who witnessed an alien girl crash landing on his planet (called Earth). There, he meets the hot alien \"human-like\" girl called Ichika. At this point, you already know that they're going to end up together. All you need to know is how they ended up together. Kaito and Ichika ending up together could have been done in a few episodes but they decided to add in the bullshit love triangle that is so common in today's Rom-Com anime. Honestly, I wouldn't mind as long as it's done right but it's not. It just ended up as being too laughably melodramatic. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, after the meeting, Kaito and his group of friends; along with Remon and Ichika, they decided to make a film that is going to be directed by Remon herself. You don't need to know about the movie because it's not that important. What you need to know is the feelings the group of friends realized towards each other while filming. This is actually one of the best part of the show (except the love triangle). It further developed the characters and we get to know more about why said character gained feelings towards that character. \\n\\n\r\nI just want to get this out of the way.. There is a very short arc in the show and it only lasted for 2 episodes. It is the most stupidest arc I have ever seen. Not only is it a filler, it's also goddamn unnecessary. I wouldn't call it completely unnecessary though because we get to learn more about Mio and her true self in this arc. What this arc contained is the cliche \"male protagonist meeting his childhood friend\" who is a female by the way. *wink wink* more love triangle and her friend that no one really cares about\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a Rom-Com meaning the story is about romance but as you can see; the show also has a \"Sci-Fi\" tag but don't think the story is heavily focused on sci-fi too because it's not. It's just a minor plot device. The sci-fi will, however, play a role with what's going to happen to both Kaito and Ichika but I won't spoil it. Just don't expect too much futuristic 2100 technology. \\n\\n\r\nI was somewhat disappointed at the fact that the \"alien\" species, especially Ichika were not given too much focus. I really wanted to learn and know more about this so called \"Federation\", more about Ichika's alien species, their technology, etc. For a 12 episode series, I guess it would be too hard to incorporate all the points I just mentioned. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nIf you've seen a J.C Staff anime before then you should be familiar with the animation of the show at first glance. It looked fairly similar to their past works like Index, Railgun and Toradora but a bit better because of increased lighting. The character designs looks pretty good but there is one character who looks very similar to J.C Staff's anime characters. I'm talking about Remon. She's a goddamn hybrid of Taiga from Toradora and Kuroko from Railgun. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nAno Natsu De Matteru offers an almost perfect soundtrack. From great OP and ED theme songs to awesome background themes, the show nailed it. The soundtrack fits with the corresponding scene that was currently playing.  \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song \"sign\" by Ray and the ED theme song is \"Vidro Moyou\" by Nagi Yanagi. The OP theme song sounded great in my opinion but it did have some similarities with Railgun OVA OP. The ED theme sounds damn awesome. It's very rare to see an anime to have an ED theme song that's actually better than the OP theme song so great job Ano Natsu. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (7/10)\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the characters were pretty decent. They weren't that bad but they weren't the best either. I mean, they're teenagers. Their actions can sometimes come off as idiotic or whenever they're involved in a dramatic stuff, they get way too melodramatic. I guess it's time to introduce the characters. \\n\\n\r\nKaito is the main protagonist of the show who has a likable personality and  fell in love with the alien girl rather quickly. Ichika is an alien girl who crash landed at Earth. She has a 99.9% human-like appearance and she is a very polite girl. She's also one of those girls that takes care of the male protagonist. In other words, she's part of the \"girl takes care of male protagonist\" cliche. \\n\r\nThen we have Tetsurou, this guy is one of those dependable best friends that you'll want in your group. Then we have Kana, a strong and independent female character. To be honest, I saw a bit of potential in her. Then she ended up as a \"third-wheel\" female character. Why you make strong female characters useless anime?! Then we have Mio, a calm, shy and overly polite girl. I'm telling you right now, this is the only character who got the most development out of the group, thus making her a likable character in the end and she also has some secrets that I don't really want to spoil. And finally, we have Remon, a mysterious senpai, a very funny girl and an annoying girl at the same time with her goddamn \"fu fu fu\" laugh. Revealing more about Remon will ruin the \"mysterious\" part about her. What I do like about her is the fact that she forces the characters to drink the \"lemon juice\" that she serves. And that lemon juice is actually alcohol. Ahh, I can watch the joke play for about 500 times and it will never get old. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8/10)\\n\r\nDespite the melodrama scenes that maked me want to punch the screen and the last 2 or 3 episodes that really felt weird and cheesy, I still enjoyed the show nonetheless. Especially the romance between Kaito and Ichika and the funny-ass comedy. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.2/10)\\n\r\n\"Ano Natsu De Matteru\" is a pretty good Romantic-Comedy anime but I wouldn't call it the greatest. It really felt generic and the concept of \"boy meets a mysterious girl\" which in this case is an alien girl has been done many times before. The show also didn't try to surprise the viewers when it comes to who the male lead is going to be with. Despite all that though, the show delivered a good and heartwarming romantic story. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Good Romantic Story\\n\r\n+Great Visuals and Animation\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Balanced Pacing\\n\r\n+Characters did their job fairly well\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Some unexplained plot points\\n\r\n-Some repetitive jokes. \\n\r\n-Melodrama scenes\\n\r\n-Ending felt weird and cheesy",

In saying that there are enough emotional moments to grab onto your attention.\r\nPros\r\nI found Ano Natsu's comedy to be one of its shining aspects, although I wouldn't call its comedy industry leading, it does enough to get a few giggles out of me each episode. Depending on what type of person you are, you might also enjoy that Ano Natsu doesn't give you definitive solutions to things, some things are interpenetrated differently and although I disliked this type of thing in other anime's,I found that it works rather well here.\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\nCharacter development is lacking a little here to be honest. Ano Natsu just sometimes feels bland as the emotional moments are undermined by the lack of character development, especially with the protagonist. I think Ano Natsu would be a lot better of a show if they extended the amount of episodes as it just feels like events were rushed.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it?\\n\r\nAno Natsu is a enjoyable anime overall, I don't particularly love anything it did but there wasn't anything that made be angry either. In the end, I think it's worth a watch especially if you are into the slice of life genre.",

            "content": "If there was one statement LA would say about Ano Natsu de Matteru, it would be \"It's like Onegai Teacher but with the fat trimmed out\" and that statement pretty much how LA feels about this anime.\r\nLA only says that both Onegai Teacher and Ano Natsu de Matteru are similar in many ways, from the alien humanoid girl befriending the main protagonist to the love triangles to it being one part comedy, one part drama. LA will say that Ano Natsu de Matteru felt better executed if LA would have of chosen which was the better anime, why?..well let's get on to it.\r\nThe plot ofAno Natsu de Matteru is about Kaito Kirishima voiced by Nobunaga Shimazaki and his friends wanting to make a movie together in the summer but with romantic unrequited tensions from all sides with a new transfer student wanting to be in the movie, both comedic and romantic tensions ensues. The plot goes by the simple summer slice of life comedy route for the most part until it ramps up the romantic tension with the entire unrequited love conga line as well as the mysterious transfer student of Ichika Takatsuki voiced by Haruka Tomatsu.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, our cast of characters are somewhat stereotypical, LA says somewhat only because they improve over time with the romantic tensions and confessions that allow them more development to them as a character and more or less feels like it plays against the type of some of the characters stereotypes. However the character that DOES NOT get this treatment was to LA was to Ichika, she played the role of the perfect girl and her being an alien only sweetened this fact and although she to gained something of a character development in the form of her secret and her romantic ties to Kaito, she was still through and through the \"perfect girl trope\". Now where this actually worked was in the unrequited love conga line LA said, mainly of Kanna Tanigawa voiced by Kaori Ishihara a love interest and friend of Kaito and Tetsurou Ishigaki voiced by Hideki Ogihara, Kaito's friend who have feelings for Kanna. LA more or less thought that Mio Kitahara voiced by Kanna Asumi was a welcome addition to the unrequited love conga line what with her weird personality quirk (and playing against the type \"in some way\") and as for Kaito himself, he was an \"ok\" character as LA wasn't phased by his romantic decisions as it was quite obvious who he was gonna fall in love with even if it kinda annoyed and pissed LA off. LA's favoruite character?...the only one of the main cast LA didn't talk about, Lemon Yamano voiced by Yukari Tamura as she was rather mysterious genre savvy and something of an audience surrogate to the unrequited love conga line, not to mention her trickster personality, her voice actor and her obvious suspicions about Ichika in the form of the movie they were filming pretty much cemented her as LA's favourite character.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by JC Staff, if there was one word to say about the animation was that it was consistent throughout, from the very detailed and vibrant character designs to the lush rural background work to even the aesthetics with the retro filming, it was a slightly above average work for JC Staff and the consistent animation throughout got high marks because of it.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, oooooohhh boy do LA have some things to talk about, let's get the easy characters done first, firstly would be Kaori Ishihara as Kanna Tanigawa, who did an exceptional job in voicing her in both her tsundere as well as her more dramatic moments in the anime and she was LA's favorite voice actor because of it, Haruka Tomatsu was a close second, only because of the her role she was given (this wasn't the first time she voiced an alien girl who becomes a love interest *cough* To Love Ru *cough*), but even Haruka Tomatsu did pretty well in this anime even with the role of Ichika. Tetsurou's voice actor Hideki Ogihara also did pretty well on his part and was nearly on par with Kaori Ishihara as well in terms of dramatic performances. Now for Mio and Lemon's voice actors. LA thought that even though LA could see that Kanna Asumi as Mio did a great job in voicing the shy Mio with her dramatic romantic moments, LA thought that Kanna Asumi was somewhat restricted for some reason because of her placed in the role of the shy girl, it just felt slightly restrictive for LA when hearing her, but that was just LA, Kanna Asumi still did well in her performance here, as for Yukari Tamura, her voicing the deadpanned genre savvy character, LA thought that she rather excelled in the comedic moments rather than the dramatic ones which makes sense in that regard. As for minor voice cast, from Ai Kayano to Aya Hisakawa, the best minor voice cast member HAS to go to Yuka Iguchi as Chiharu Arisawa, a rival love interest to Mio, why did LA pick Yuka Iguchi???...because her genki levels are INSANELY HIGH borderline yandere vocals.\\n\\n\r\nComedically, Ano Natsu de Matteru does have those character jabs and situational comedy moments for the laughs, but this anime has anime and movie references thrown here and there like the obvious MIB name drop to Highschool of the Dead, but as LA said in the voice acting section, LA thought that Yukari Tamura and her character were really the best in the comedic department.\\n\\n\r\nRomantically however is a bit more complicated as LA does have mixed feelings with the romance in this anime, it's one part great due to the characters themselves playing against the type or being ironic and the other part, the romantic development does develop the individual characters as well and some of the choices that were made \"did make sense\" yet LA didn't like it and the unrequited love conga line did make the dynamic of the group of friends question themselves. LA's frustration mostly came from the love triangle of Kaito, Ichika and Kanna (especially Kanna) as well as the obvious of Tetsurou and Mio, but LA does \"get\" why the choices happened in the romantic side of things and as compensation at least it brought in much better character development for both the losers (in the form of getting over our rejection) and winners (relationship-wise showing they really do love each other even amongst the romantic anarchy).\\n\\n\r\nNow at the start of this review, LA pretty much said that Ano Natsu de Matteru was a better anime than Onegai Teacher, yes LA did say that, but in better detail, Ano Natsu de Matteru felt like it went straight to what it had to do with it's main cast and essentially had no filler (thus \"trimming down the fat\") as well as bring in the dramatic comedic moments when it needed to. Onegai Teacher for LA had a bit of problem with it's \"filler moments\" as well as how they handled the \"secret\" far latter compared to Ano Natsu de Matteru's reveal. Nonetheless Onegai Teacher is still a decent anime even if LA critiqued it saying it had some problems where Ano Natsu de Matteru fixed.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending rather ramped up the tension to what is a slice of life romance anime, by bringing in the \"chase to the goal\" kind of situation and really by the climax of the ending is brought about a rather teary ending which by the final scenes gave LA both something of a satisfying ending and FINALLY gave us some context as to who Lemon is as well as showing with subtle hints to make the teary climax an overall satisfying ending. The only problem in this is...well...SPOILERS!.....for the most part no one really gets together and are just \"friends\"...which was probably the only thing that irked this ending...nonetheless satisfying ending for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nAno Natsu de Matteru overall did really feel like what the title implies...\"waiting in the summer\", from summer vacation to teenage hormones as well as complicated love triangles and squares typical of romance animes. Did Ano Natsu de Matteru satisfy LA?...heck yes, is it a good romance, yes but slightly cliche, but who cares, Ano Natsu de Matteru is better than Onegai Teacher?...they're both good...it depends how you see both executed really and finally, is it a good anime?...well if you like complicated love triangles and the romance genre...then yeah...just sit back and watch the summer sun of Ano Natsu de Matteru as well as romantic chaos that comes later...",

            "content": "Now, before I review, this is my favorite anime. So I might be a bit biased.\r\nThe hidden gem, Ano Natsu de Matteru, otherwise known as \"Waiting in the Summer\" is a romantic slice of life with a hint of sci-fi. It\u2019s about a group of friends that decide to create a movie over the summer time. I only really decided to watch this because it under the many recommendations in Ano Hana. (Plus there was a romance tag)\r\nStory- 7\r\nI\u2019ll admit, it\u2019s not the best anime I\u2019ve ever seen before. I\u2019ve definitely seen much better but this happened to appeal to my tastes very well. Thestory is definitely the weakest part. It\u2019s very clich\u00e9 with the whole, hang out with friends with romance idea. But its inclusion with sci-fi that makes it unique.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 9\\n\r\nOne of the most enjoyable parts of this anime is the art. I feel like I\u2019m watching a movie the entire time. The art style also gives that summer feeling. It\u2019s very bright and colorful.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9\\n\r\nAlso an extremely enjoyable part. From the amazing use of the opening and ending. To the minor details like glasses clinking together, or the sound of cicadas. The sound in this anime just gives me that \"chill\" feeling that I couldn\u2019t get from any other. Jin Aketagawa (The sound director) adds a slight techno feel to most of the songs which brings out the sci-fi aspect to this anime while still keeping its romantic slice of life genre in the music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 8\\n\r\nI\u2019ll admit, the characters are very clich\u00e9. But what those characters do. They create a perfect love triangle. Well more like a love pentagon. Normally, at least one character is left out in these romance slice of life genres. But this one does it so well. Good luck trying to ship them\\n\\n\r\nEnding- 10\\n\r\nThose anime endings that make you crave more. But then you realize that there is no more. Well this is a perfect example. Does the ending feel a bit rushed? Yes. But the way the ending is done is perfect. The last few episodes bring out the sci-fi genre of this anime. The extremely climactic last episode followed with the last few minutes of the anime. You will start getting mad that such a good anime ended in such a way until you see the last scene. Then you will question, \"Was that a cliffhanger\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\r\nThis anime definitely satisfied my cravings for being a sucker for romance. And it gave me that extra summer appeal that I love.\\n",

            "content": "Ano Natsu de Matteru brings out nostalgia in the most elegant and seamless way possible.\r\nThe art is so warm and comfortable, I just fall in.  The sound design is as close to perfect as I've ever heard.  In fact, for me that's the defining characteristic of the series.  From the clicking of the camera to the sounds of glass gently hitting glass, everything works perfectly and adds immensely to every other element.  Not to mention the VAs (or their audio engineer) knocked it out of the park, at least to my non-Japanese ears...there are quite a few ASMR-worthy moments.  Likemost other things in Ano Natsu de Matteru, they are warm and simply on point.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fine and adequately developed for the genre, but from a storytelling perspective no one is particularly remarkable.  In fact, the story itself isn't really worth mentioning, but much like Toradora, this proves that excellent execution is more than enough to make up for a bit of a weak plot.  This actually works to its advantage in my case, since consuming this kind of plot is so central to my past, and in an anime so dependent on appealing to sentimental emotions, it just whisks me away to that old world.\\n\\n\r\nAs for complaints, reactions to large events are often very unnatural, though I'll stop there as to avoid spoilers.  Again, the plot isn't particularly great on paper, and the romance definitely falls into very trope-y and melodramatic territory, though it does switch things up a bit, it isn't entirely formulaic.  In general, you'll have an idea of where things are going, but there are still surprises along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe sci-fi elements are masterfully interwoven into the narrative, never becoming overwhelming or alienating to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nAno Natsu de Matteru has its flaws, sure, but they're hardly in the areas that matter.  Evoking nostalgia in a subtle manner that doesn't involve just showing images from the past is rare as hell in anime, and this series achieves that wonderfully.  ...and I'm not even from Japan.  It's just universal, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nGive it a try, though avoid if you don't like tearjerkers.",

Really, i mean it.\r\nThe first impression i got when i watched it is that this anime is just another harem anime that doesn't have any story.\r\nBut, i was really really wrong about that.\r\nEvery episodes gives me goose-bump all over my body. Every episodes shocks me to the core. Usually i can guess what will come in the next episode, but my guess now is a bit off the mark.\r\nI don't know what will come next, i don't know what should i expected in the next episode, but i still want it to be a happy end.\r\nAnyway, let's start thereview.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime from the story: 10\\n\r\nLike i said earlier that this anime has a nice way of swinging the outcome of every single obvious event. You won't really know the outcome if you don't watch it from the start till the end. It is surprisingly nice.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThough that this anime is another romance based story, it still gives you another awesome creature of the alien robot. Ehm.. maybe that is spoiler. Anyway, you'll know what i mean after you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't so bad but it is not that awesome either. There are times when i had a difficulty in understanding the dialogues between the character, because of the many dialogues that occurred in the same time and the sound just mixed up together.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nWell, it is good but it's just not my type. Kaito doesn't really powerful and outstanding. But i like how every character overcome their problem and stick together at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nIf i can give a 100 i would. I enjoyed it so much that actually i wanna cry just thinking the relation between episode 9 and 12.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this is one of my favorite anime so far. Actually I've been searching for an anime that can move one's heart, and i think i found it.",

The steps for falling in love for the two main characters mostly involve  blushing, stuttering, and getting intimate while having cheesy wet dreams of each other, which became extremely aggravating after a few episodes.\r\nEveryone also seems to like someone else for no apparent reason and are willing to do incredibly stupid and selfless things for them seemingly only for the sake of moving the story along. This detracts from the believability of the situation, so I neverfelt for any of the characters. While I can sympathize with a weeping, heartbroken youngster, in this case, I just roll my eyes because: 1. Romance feels extremely forced. 2. The characters grate on my nerves. 3. I'm not a believer in undying, unconditional love at first sight :D.\\n\\n\r\nThe only positives for this show would be art and the supporting characters (Lemon ftw!). Art and animation for the show is well done and easy on the eyes. If most other shows looked like this I wouldn't mind at all. \\n\r\nBecause I dislike how the romance is done in the anime, the least romantically involved characters were the ones I liked most. Lemon is an amusing troll, and Rinon is just too cuddlicious",

I realized after watching this that it was the first anime i ever really hated with a passion. The beginning is great don't get me wrong but from then on the confusion and the heartbreak that follows, i totally wasn't ready for it. It wasn't a thing like Grave of the Fireflies and all of those other sad movies/tv shows. It was only misery and depression. I don'tknow how to explain. I can't argue with you if you liked it but in my opinion I wish I had never considered watching it on Crunchyroll...a bit harsh, huh? So was the freaking love rectangle/square or whatever in this anime. I didn't want a full corny romantic anime story but this went too far. + the ending on skipping how Takatsuki made it back to earth, and not bothering really for a good ending is what hurt me most. what happened between all that time that was skipped? more friends getting hurt? more alien shooting? honestly it was ok but i can't ever like this anime even if i tried.",

            "content": "Having watched over half of the story so far, I have to say how well this series will be accepted will depend on the story's ending. Yes, the fate of this series depends almost entirely on its ending. Why? \r\nFirst I have to compare this to Ano Hana a little bit. Beside all the differences you could find between the two, they are actually awfully similar. I'm not really talking about the exact plot or characters but the atmosphere, tone, and vision behind these two stories. They come from the same director. I won't praise here how well Ano Hana was directed. Do keep inmind this sort of 11-12 episode long story isn't like Clannad that has a lot of space to span for a long time. I don't mean just the number of episodes, but more importantly the span of time for the story itself. For a short melodrama to come across as genuine and poignant that can appeal to a large audience, it takes more than just good characters and plot. However, with all the things I've seen so far in this series, I'm not really worried about its direction. By direction, I mean the sort of things that can make it into a genuine and convincing story. However, I have to say so far even though the plot isn't really disappointing, it isn't great either. It's very very melodramatic, and honestly I'm scared of it turning too much to bear by the end. The emotions will come across as pretty genuine alright and the atmosphere and tone will keep it progressing in a \"dignified\" way, but will the plot run them flat? I'm not sure. My fear is that the plot will get out of control to the point burying all the merits it has accumulated so far and the potential that's still slowly sprouting. \\n\\n\r\nI will update my review and score after finishing it. I do hope it'll turn out better. \\n",

Even at large distances, the strong bonds that were built will always be there.\r\nAno Natsu de Matteru is an anime largely about relationships between high school friends. As they develop and change, the relationships get stronger, and the friends understand each other more.\r\nJust from reading the synopsis it helped me see that this anime wouldn't just be another alien, romance, comedy. It is much more realistic and thought out than other anime with similar genres.  I knew that this would be a more drama filled show than comedy. The comedy is lightly put in, andthe hurdles that are overcome between the friends are what makes it different. It shows real life situations instead of ones that are only created for the laughs.\\n\\n\r\nThe story portrays the relationships of the friends being built through trials. The romance is well put out. It isn't just one relationship, or a harem, or a love triangle. Love is found and lost with all the characters. Confessions are made throughout, and it isn't only just a one time confessions at the end, with the main couple getting together. I found the story really amazing. It made me think about relationships with others, and it wasn't all just straightforward. The relations are realistic and they portray the creation of friendships and relationships very well.\\n\\n\r\nFor art, it was a very vibrant and light colored show. Everything about it was bright, and colorful. The dark nights would be lighted by bright lights, stars, and the characters who were drawn very exuberantly. I received a warm feeling from watching this, and it made me wish for summer to come soon.\\n\\n\r\nThe background sounds help show the time of summer. The starting of the end song before the credits came gave the ending more feeling. Most of the endings of the episode would be something alarming happening, and a new trial would begin, or be completed. In the end, the feeling that we should be getting from the end is helped with the end song.\\n\\n\r\nI loved all the characters. They all had flaws. They all had emotions. None of them were dumb characters who were only there to make things funny. They all had a purpose in increasing the strength of the bonds, and helped make the show more interesting when a new character arrived, causing emotions to run wild and problems to rise. The characters were fun, and very interesting to watch whenever they interacted with the others.\\n\\n\r\nI highly enjoyed this anime. It reminded me a lot of Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai, or AnoHana for short. It was about friends and their relationships with one another. Trials were overcome, and in the end, the friends become closer to one another.\\n\\n\r\nI believe anyone who likes Slice of Life, Drama, Comedy, and Romance would love this anime. The light-heartedness of this anime is very calming and tranquil. The emotions received makes one think a lot about life. This anime was much better than I expected. I was still expecting something very good, but It wasn't all comedic and fake like I thought it would be. The realism greatly impacted me and made the show much better.\\n\\n\r\nFriends are your life, and they will always be there to support you when something happens.",

The characters don't have nearly any development, but thats not really the point of the show, its about love and moving on. The show smashes this aspect of it out of the park with heart wrenching dialogue and (in this case in a good way) predictable events. I especially like how the love \"triangle\" in this show isn't a shape at all but in fact a line, such thatif two couples were to end up working out one would be left in the dust. The cast of this show understands this and you are left to agonize with them which is part of the reason I think you end up feeling for them in the end despite there being almost no charter growth to speak of. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you like crying and then crying some more, give this one a shot",

Plus, if you still like sad stories then ... YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS DUDE!\r\nArt : 9\r\nThe art is very cute.(Wow I'm a guy and I say its cute?

But this series is something special, how they gave most characters enough time on screen, enough time so you know the past/backstory and who they love deep down, It affects you, Each character has a love interest and its usually not the one that loves them, I liked the whole drama this caused, even if it didn't go the way i wanted it to. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nVery nice, Like the Designs for the characters, even the cute little Alien thing Ichika brings with her, is a cool character and adds to the whole warm atmosphere the art creates.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nLiked The Intro/Outro music + Most voice characters suited their personality, good choices.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series ALOT, Last few episodes felt a bit dragged out, but overall, Amazing character depth, great sound and visuals, even if the story is nothing special what happens is full of drama and keeps you on the edge after every episode, Watched whole series in a day, this shows that :)\\n\\n\r\nShould You Watch It:\\n\\n\r\nYes!!! One of the better series ive seen in a long while. It may not pull you in straight away but keep with it, the drama does intensify alot, its an enjoyable watch and one id highly recommend.\\n\\n",

            "content": "[This is NOT a SPOILER free review] \r\nPersonally I really enjoyed the anime although I didn't quiet like the ending because it wasn't the way I expected it to be or simply it wasn't the way I wanted it to be.  \r\nGenerally speaking the anime consist of 12 episodes which really resembles the anime \"Onegai Teacher\" a lot but are still different. However, I've enjoyed \"Onegai Teacher\" more than Ano Natsu de Matteru though.\r\nCommon between these two anime:\r\n1) Both female protagonists are from space whose spaceship ended up in a lake.\r\n2) They both have a biological creature like which is supposed to be theprogram of their spaceship which allows them to control it and also teleport themselves or other people as well to the place they want. \\n\\n\r\n3) Both female protagonists are older than the main male protagonists.\\n\\n\r\n4) In both anime the male protagonist falls in love with the alien female protagonists with whom they start living with and have a female classmate who is in love with them as well who tries to get their affection. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's get back to Ano Natsu de Matteru.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't complex at all despite being classified as a \"Sci Fi\" genre although there are terms they use which probably are just words without any real meaning probably. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance is the typical high school one which can be found in many Shojo manga/anime and sometimes in shonen as well, where the female protagonist has a rival competing for the male protagonist. However, the romance escalates pretty fast between the destined one and there's less biting around the bush. Of course they didn't miss the hurdles and ordeals that one must face when falling in love.\\n\\n\r\nIt is pretty comedic but I've seen better romantic comedies that really made me laughed so hard. \\n\\n\r\nThere are very few actions as well but nothing to be impressed with however.\\n\\n\r\nThe music are not bad but \"Onegai Teacher\" had amazing OST's by comparison, especially with KOTOKO's Shooting Star OP but the ending of Ano Natsu de Matteru is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty well done with some amazing backgrounds and as for the characters they are pretty good if not the best.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Ano Natsu de Matteru is practically a romance anime with Sci fi, action and comedy as the supporting elements but it's still enjoyable and worth watching. Well, I might not have given a detailed review about the anime but I would still refrain a lot of you from judging the anime by the ratings and reviews of other users and watch it for yourself!\\n\\n",

It also contains spoilers. \r\nWhen I started watching this anime I expected something like Ano Hana rather focused on romance. And it kinda gave me those vibes. But as soon as I perceived the whole love chain, I started doubting. I felt that the main couple/pairing of the show was meaningless, just like one of those hundreds of animes where a foreigner girl appears or falls from the sky and everything changes in the life of the other characters , onlythat in this show, she spoils everything. I am not sure what the reason is, but I don't like the outcome of this love chain. The girl appear and the boy falls in love immediatly with her, for no reason. Then, it goes so smooth for the couple, so perfect, not caring about the others at all. And Kanna gets the short end of the stick. Anyway, Kaito doesn't deserve Kanna's love. And I don't feel bad for the end at all. You reap what you sow. Also, I didn't like the pose of \"I'm fine as long as the person I love is smiling\". It's just an excuse to fill the plot and feed the main couple's egoism.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the worst part is the \"Oh, yeah, this summer was fantastic\". Yes, it was fantastic for the main couple, but not that good for the others.\\n\\n\r\nSo, basically, I think that Ichika, and the whole sci-fi thing, is an extra.",

            "content": "FROM THE MAKERS OF ANOHANA\r\nDo you like romance? How about romance with aliens? Yes, I'm looking at you, hentai watchers; you know you love that shiz.\r\nWith \"Buy Your Special Someone Something In Exchange For Sex Day\"\u2014I mean Valentines Day coming up, you know love is in the air, so why not review a recent \"romance\" anime I've recently watched called Waiting To Get Dem Alien Nudes In The Summer, or AnoNatsu for short.\r\nSYNOPSIS\r\n\"Movie hipster-nerd abandons his normal life in order to get into the alien-sluts' pants.\"\r\nPLOT\r\nThe story of AnoNotSoGood kicks off the same way any other typical romantic comedy would. Heck, if you took themain characters' glasses and changed his hair color to orange, you'd pretty much be watching the first episode of To Love-Ru. Heck, if you changed the alien's hair to blond and gave her a ribbon, you'd be watching a show that just can't accept the fact that Onodera is the best girl. END THE MANGA ALREADY!\\n\\n\r\nMy point is that AnoNatsu follows the same formula that mostly all romance shows are built around:\\n\\n\r\nBoy A meets Girl A\\n\\n\r\nGirl A suddenly becomes friends with Boy A and forever changes his life.\\n\\n\r\nBoy A and Girl A must go through trials of love to make them closer.\\n\\n\r\nBoy A and Girl A supposedly become a couple.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a typical formula, but nobody gets on AnoNatsu's back because of the fact that it has the same character designer and director from AnoHana. Shoot, that's what you guys most likely care the most about anyways. I should make sure I put that at the top of this boring review.\\n\\n\r\nDRAMA AF\\n\r\nAnoNatsu has more drama than an average day on Anime Amino. Actually, that's over-exaggerated, not even the Bachelor combined with Downton Abbey has more drama than an average day on AA. However, with AnoNatsu ending each episode with HUGE developmental events combined with basing the entire show around this love-orgy. I call it a love-orgy mainly because it's not a love triangle, but it's not simple enough to be called a love line.\\n\\n\r\nYou have an average group of friends, two girls and two boys, in an agricultural area of Japan. Quiet shy girl likes blue haired broski who likes loli tsundere who OBVIOUSLY likes the dense and stupid hipster loser that is the main character when all of a sudden\\n\\n\r\nAYYYY LMAOOOOOO\\n\\n\r\nAlien slut makes the dilemma that much worse. Before, everyone was going to end up with someone (supposedly), but now that there's a fifth character into the fray, someone's gunna end up sad and lonely. Naturally, childhood friend is going to be rejected by nerd faggot for the huge honker alien from outer space which, by the way, we have no idea if they can even reproduce together or not. The real reason that we keep watching AnoNatsu is for broski to decide which girl to love and which girl to shove.\\n\\n\r\nThis gives me an idea...\\n\\n\r\nLOVE OR SHOVE\\n\r\nWelcome to the first and last ever episode of LOVE OR SHOVE! In this game, our bachelor must choose which 2D waifu he should keep for laifu. I'm your host, Remon/Lemon. In the anime I'm the mysterious insert character that is there for the main purpose of putting the other characters into situations that will potentially improve their relationship. Before we begin, let's meet our bachelor himself.\\n\\n\r\nTetsurou is overly-handsome for his age. Because of this, he's often confessed to by many girls. Despite this, he remains true to his love for Kanna. However, what he cherishes more than his relationships with girls is his friendship. That's right, Tetsurou is a true bro through thick and thin.\\n\\n\r\nKanna is the lovely lady that Tetsurou is trying to make happy. To do so, he'll go so far as to deny his own feelings, causing him more grief.\\n\\n\r\nOut of all the characters, Brightning believes that Kanna is the most developed. Her personality is the most vibrant, resulting in the viewer feeling more empathic towards her in her times of grief and joy.\\n\\n\r\nNow introducing the other contestant, Mio! AnoNatsu starts off with Mio being a quiet, shy and well endowed ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) lady who sees Tetsurou hurting himself over Kanna and grows feelings for him. She begins as a bland and uninteresting, but as the story progresses, we learn more about Mio that makes her certainly... Unique.\\n\\n\r\nOoohoohoohooh, looks like we have quite the dilemma for Tetsurou. Should he grow the courage to Kanna, or should he give up on the Tsundere childhood friend and put his dick in the girl who cares for him? Let's ask ultra-loser faggot and the female lead of the new upcoming film, Star Whores, space slut.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, my name isn't ultra-loser faggot, it's Kaito. I like directing erotic films and being an overall idiot. As for who Tetsurou should love, I think he should choose neither and join me and Ichika for a super awesome alien tentacle threesome. Right, Ichika?\\n\\n\r\n*loud alien screeching*\\n\\n\r\nUm, alright. Well, it's finally time to choose who Tetsurou will love and who he will shove. DRUMROLL PLEASE!\\n\\n\r\nIt appears you'll have to watch the show to find out! Teehee~!\\n\\n\r\nBEACH ARC\\n\r\nMost romance animes pull a generic beach episode halfway through the show. Not AnoNatsu. Sure, they include the expected swimming with swimsuits and beach volleyball, but they do so much more than that, thanks to these characters.\\n\\n\r\nKaito's childhood friend accompanied by her best friend acted as rivals for the main girls. What they have that the others don't is courage, an outgoing attitude and an aspiration to get what they want which, in this case, is Kaito and Tetsurou. Naturally, the other girls aren't happy. Meanwhile, Lemon is just over there being a troll and slowly watching the world burn.\\n\\n\r\nI consider this as worthy to be mentioned in my review because in my opinion, it's the few episodes where the cast improved most on their personality and overall character. To list a few things that happen, Ichikunt realizes there's more than a feeling of friendship between her and Kaito, Kaito gains confidence with his relationship, Tetsurou realizes the entire romantic dilemma of his friends, and we get some MAJOR information and character development of Mio; and somehow through all of this, the two new characters get a large amount of character development in order for them to seem natural in the anime. In my opinion, these were the best episodes of AnoNatsu and possibly one of the best beach episodes I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nSOUNDTRACK\\n\r\nI have absolutely no complaints about the soundtrack of AnoNatsu. Whenever a song is either done by Kotoko, Ray, Mami Kawada OR nano.RIPE, I always get a sense of warm weather or summer air. The sound director of AnoNatsu certainly knew that when they chose Kotoko to perform the opening. Not only that, but by somehow drugging the soundtrack with euphoric riffs and tones, the music was able to have a sense of space and sci-fi into the mixture.\\n\\n\r\nIn case that wasn't enough, knowing that AnoNatsu was going to be a hella dramatic show, they had Nagi Yanagi behind the end theme, which, may I remind you, is utterly captivating.\\n\\n\r\nPERSONAL THOUGHTS\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT\\n\r\nI saw what was going to happen, but I still continued to watch AnoNatsu because I'm a masochistic pig when it comes to romance anime like this. Like I did with To Love-Ru and Nisekoi and Sakurasou, I rooted for the girl who had feelings for the main character since episode 1 to, as always, get disappointed by the end result and utterly despise the main female lead that comes out of nowhere and wins the main characters' love. Why can't there be an anime where the childhood friend wins his love!?!?!? The perfect ending for me would've been a surprise twist where Kaito ends up with Kanna, Tetsurou ends up with Mio (cute af btw) and Ichika convinces her parents to let her stay on Earth with her new friends, but NO! \\n\\n\r\nAlso, can I take a minute to express how pissed I am over the ending of this show? Showing a picture of them in the future may imply that they met again, but IT DOESNT IMPLY THAT THEY HAD A HAPPY ENDING! Well, considering that the director behind AnoHana directed this, I should've saw this coming as well. I guess I'm just an idiot when it comes to romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nAnoNatsu is an anime where you get the most enjoyment out of it when you pair your favorite characters together at the very beginning. As the show progresses, you'll find yourself cheering on your favorite pair and get extremely into the show whenever something extremely dramatic occurs. Just a warning though: 5 characters = a fifth wheel. One of the characters will end up forever alone and you'll end up feeling bad for them. With that in mind, have fun watching your ships go to hell in Ano Not So Kind To It's Viewers",

            "content": "The plot of an alien coming to Earth, integrating into a school setting, falling in love\u2026we all know it. Tenchi Muyo exemplifies this plot but Ano Natsu de Matteru refines it to a sharp point. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Ano Natsu has its faults, but it is an overall heart-felt and well executed experience. There are a lot of parts that are kind of stupid or are a bit too much, but if you can block out all of the crap happening on the side and all of the rather stupid plot twists (especially toward the end) and focus more so on the romance betweenIchika and Kaito, then you\u2019ll probably enjoy yourself.\\n\\n\r\nIchika is an alien from some unnamed planet who crashes into Earth, more specifically, Japan. Her crash severely injures Kaito, who is filming a movie at the time. Kaito is saved by her kissing him and putting healing nanomachines inside of him through the kiss. And after that she integrates into school life, she lives with Kaito, and she joins in on a summer of movie making magic.\\n\\n\r\nThe movie making part of the plot is integral, but it is pushed to the side usually to make room for the romance. This is a romance and drama heavy series, and romance and drama comes aplenty. There are two love triangles going on, one of which becomes a love rhombus at one point. The love rhombus has a single guy at the apex, Kaito. The girl who is closest to him and you probably can figure out he\u2019s going to get with is Ichika. The other characters, especially Kanna, you just don\u2019t care about. There\u2019s so much crying going on and loves being admitted, yet you just don\u2019t care about anything but the developing romance between Kaito and Ichika because it\u2019s the only cute romance, and they are the only two characters with any substance, albeit not a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThere are three phases to Ano Natsu. The explanatory, unexciting first phase is the school phase. In this Ichika and Kaito live together, go to school, decide to make a movie with their friends. The second phase is the start of summer, where they make the movie and the puppy love starts to come out. The third, and dumbest, phase is the space phase, where Ichika\u2019s sister comes to save her because the Federation has a search party and wants to take her back. I\u2019m going to get a little deeper into this last phase because it\u2019s a very weak set up to a decent finale.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s all this space stuff going on. There\u2019s a Federation and these stupid bio-organic spaceship things (that look like futuristic Pokemon) that come to take Ichika back to her planet. And nobody wants her to go, especially not Kaito because he loves her and wants to be with her forever and all that cute crap. Her sister comes and they figure out that they might be able to find some proof an alien has been to the planet and that would show the Federation that Earth is not a grade F planet which means it\u2019d be okay for Ichika to live there. There\u2019s a long, drawn out part where the friends all branch off and try to take some of the heat off Ichika and Kaito as they find this random place in her memory where her ancestor was at. The friendship bullshit train rides for a whole episode, and is only broken up by one of the friends, the tiny and likeable Remon, using her pedo-van\u2019s missiles and grappler arms.\\n\\n\r\nThis part goes pretty fast and it\u2019s not a particularly well done section until the end. There\u2019s a lot of stuff being thrown at you, and the idea of Earth being an F rated planet and Ichika needing to leave it because it has never had alien contact makes no sense\u2026She\u2019s an alien. Alien\u2026contact! She\u2019s made the contact! Boom! Earth is a D rated planet! We\u2019ve gone up in the universe! Thanks Ichika, now let Kaito bang you and start populating the world with half human, half human-looking-alien babies!\\n\\n\r\nNow to the very ending.  This means spoilers, though that should be a given for my reviews.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending genuinely surprised me. Now, this had nothing to do with the idiotic Men in Black bullshit. That went beyond stupid. I mean, I\u2019m okay with aliens and all that, but the Men in Black? Rocket launchers? Using sniper rifles to shoot at an alien thingy from two feet away? It was funny in that unexpected way, but it was pretty stupid nonetheless. Ichika gets captured and goes to space and loses out on being with her love, which is a really ballsy move for the writer. That made me genuinely care about the epilogue. Usually an anime would come up with some stupid way of getting out of that bad ending, but Ano Natsu enjoys it and might actually get some tears out of it. When the cast gets together to watch the movie that they have produced (courtesy of Remon), it is a pretty good tear-jerker. It puts the stupid stuff in and the emotional stuff in and that blend really brings the anime together. But the very, very end is where I want to commend this anime the most.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a lot, but it does have an impact, especially on me, and does work so much better because of this. Now, you have this niggling sensation for the six or seven minutes of the last episode that someway, somehow, Ichika is going to appear in some fashion and a happy ending will be achieved. But the final few seconds of the show, when it\u2019s a future class at the high school watching Kaito\u2019s movie, is amazingly effective in closing the anime. You hear the old footage, you get sad, but then that new clip shows up with Ichika back from space. And the series ends.\\n\\n\r\nHALLELUJAH!\\n\\n\r\nThis is a perfect example of ending an anime on a good note, but not being too overt about it. It\u2019s a lesson that some writers could take to heart. Ending a series like this, a series that has something bad happen that pulls the lovers apart, and then having a long-ass epilogue where they get back together and you feel good is not as effective as that final few seconds.\\n\\n\r\nThe sense of helplessness and sadness that takes place over the seven minutes between Ichika\u2019s going back to space and that clip in the movie makes that single clip, maybe four seconds long, just that much more effective. It leaves you, the viewer, to fill in the blanks. It makes you so much more happy because you can interpret the ending however you want to and say that Ichika and Kaito are happily together, or maybe she just came back on vacation. Having a bit of a concrete answer to our questions about if she comes back is good, and allowing the viewer to fill in the rest is even better.\\n\\n\r\nSo anyway, let\u2019s talk a bit about the characters. Kaito is a likeable male lead. There\u2019s not a lot to say about him because he\u2019s kind of your generic lead where he has very little personality beside his love of a hobby (filming) and his love for a heroine (Ichika). And Ichika is kind of the same, she\u2019s not got a lot of character to her, but she\u2019s got enough that you can feel good about the romance that she develops with Kaito.\\n\\n\r\nKanna is the annoying bitch who loves Kaito but Kaito doesn\u2019t love her and she cries a lot because of that. I hated her. She wasn\u2019t a character. She was an angsty waterfall.\\n\\n\r\nMio is moe and useless. Her love for Tetsurou is cute, I guess, but the fact she is a nudist is weird and doesn\u2019t really provide any laughs. Especially because we see her naked with a panda bear plush before she reveals herself as a nudist. This is something that can come across as a little bit weird\u2026I assumed she liked banging panda plushes.\\n\\n\r\nRemon is badass. She\u2019s screwing with everyone, keeping a chart of the romances so that she can manipulate them, takes over as director of the film, and is a Man in Black. Now, this last one is kind of dumb, but it still cements the fact she\u2019s amazing. While Ichika is the alien, not a lot of mystery surrounds her. Remon is the opposite, even at the end you don\u2019t really understand what the hell her intentions are. They\u2019re good, but they aren\u2019t defined at all. She\u2019s my favorite character.\\n\\n\r\nTetsurou is\u2026well, he\u2019s not bad. He\u2019s just kind of there.\\n\\n\r\nAno Natsu de Matteru is a good romance and does a lot of things right, but there are some silly portions and a lot of side story that takes away from everything. A lot of the characters are lame and uninteresting, while a few are good and maybe memorable. The romance is cute and might stick with you for a bit. It is the kind of show that you\u2019ll wish could focus on what\u2019s good, and give up on all the side stuff that doesn\u2019t matter. Because you don\u2019t care about that, you care about seeing Ichika and Kaito develop.",

            "content": "*Well if you are ignorant of what the term \"Convenient\" means then maybe a 10 for you*\r\nAno Natsu de Matteru is a story about friends who decide to make a movie.Well suddenly through that movie ,they will become more matured and their relation will become more complex.\r\nStory is kinda common, with an unimportant and unrealistic plot. . . Its so fake and convenient even China won't admit it made it...but as it unravels it makes good uses of every detail it presented which results in a semi good progress which makes up for its majority of flaws. In other words, ITS WELL WRITTEN!\r\nThe comedy ispretty high in there, you can call it classic, but classic ain't bad. The romance is there and its fulfilling but way too childish and convenient that you can really predict it from ep1. Another thing concerning the \"romantic\" aspect, this show contained a love Pentagram.It also contains a decent amount of \"Fan service\" for those who like it \"Hot\"! Most of the service is used in order to produce comedy which is something excusable and not so bad at all!\\n\r\nCharacters are realistic and perfectly normal in doing what they were supposed to do. Each has their personality and all match together and make a great group.The thing is that for a Slice of Life anime, their reactions in romantic topics and others are way too childish and there is no emotion and while there is a serious vibe in the air,not only nothing really happeneds but it like it never happened. Meaning like there was no pain after a ball hits ur face.\\n\r\nAnimation and art style was beautiful. The only thing i personally didn't like its the hair animation style. It makes me think that instead of gel or w/e they used Jizz. Like literally. Its like . . . See for yourself ...~(???~) and another one... The characters almost had the \"perma blush\" syndrome. You know when from only looking each other they went blood red!\\n\r\nMusic in general wasn't bad.Both OP and ED was decent not something memorable tho.There was some piano  and classic guitar which made the tick. Overall, i would say satisfying.\\n\r\n-------------------Personal thoughts and weaknesses--------------------\\n\r\nI mentioned most of the weaknesses above. Let's sum them up pretty quick.Illogical interactions in the romantic scenes.Way too convenient. Perma blush syndrome.Bad/nonsense plot.In addition to those,there development of the was so obvious one could see it from ep 5, but no everyone.Moreover,personally the main romantic story wasn't as important and enjoyable as the side one.\\n\r\nThe ending was disappointing,enjoyable and fulfilling at the same time...The truth is that the ending it was masterful to be honest,but it was so convoluted to gather all the pieces that it seemed disappointing !\\n\r\nIn conclusion, it was an enjoyable \"ride\" with \"Well written\" story and somewhat good Com-rom. Everything else was terrible. Forced drama and nonexistent slice of life and convenience levels 1000/10 . . .\\n\r\nI would recommend it only to the Com-rom fans but be prepared to get really frustrated while watching it.\\n\r\nReasons to watch it:\\n\r\n-Lemon is the best girl. Just repeat \"LEMON DA BEST GIRL\"\\n\r\n-Satisfying romance  (\uff89?\u30ee?)\uff89*:\uff65\uff9f? ?\uff9f\uff65: *\u30fd(?\u30ee?\u30fd) ACTUALLY, the side story was better!!\\n\r\n-Cliche Romance and Love pentagon. A loves B--> A is loved by C ---> C is loved by D --> D is loved by E and who knows about B? :D \\n\\n\r\nThis was my Shameless critic.\\n\r\nI am leaving without remorse!",

            "content": "Story: 10/10\r\nI'm not a super pessimistic critic, plus I really only watch animes that I'll know I'll somewhat enjoy. This anime was seriously one of the best I've watched though! The beginning left a sense of wonder, but it set up all the characters and who would probably eventually get together. The episodes throughout gave us good character development, and the ending made me a bit teary-eyed, which (for me at least) is a sign of a good anime and I really got deep into.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nArt is nothing special, though I quite liked it. It fit the anime well and it wasn't super realistic orweird like some romance animes. The few fight scenes in the anime were done pretty well, but nothing crazy. Overall, art style is nice and doesn't bother me at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nIn terms of the opening and ending, they seemed pretty lackluster to me. I'm not a fan of slow songs or songs that aren't very catchy, I like upbeat songs. I found myself always skipping the opening or ending, which, well yea, ya know.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis, in my opinion, is one of the anime's strongest points. The characters had personality and the MC was someone I could relate to. The side characters as well kept true to their personality and I really felt feelings for them. Anyway, I really loved the characters in the anime :)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOMGGGG, the comedy in this anime is GOLD! I laughed out loud so many times, it hurt. Especially with the MIB and another scene where I just bursted out laughing so many times! The drama in this anime was really enjoyable as well and it kept me wanting to watch more. I binge watched this anime in two nights, unfortunately, but I'll say that it's kinda hard to get the feels when you have too many sessions of watching this. You kinda have to binge watch animes like these to really feel for them and understand what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI don't find these kind of animes often, which is why I just straight up gave it a 10 because I just loved this so much and I got the feellsssssss. Any anime that gives feels, in my opinion, is good. Well, I liked it, but people probably don't like it as much as me xD This show really reminded me of Golden Time, which is also another favorite of mine because of the drama and character development.",

            "content": "I picked up Ano Natsu on a whim after I realized multiple fansub groups that I follow decided to sub it. And I have to say it was a pleasant surprise. Ano Natsu is about an alien visitor during a particular summer who happens to motivate an otherwise stagnant group of friends into doing something. People may draw references to Ano Hana (other than just for the ano) based on the fact that the introduction of another character (ghost in Hana's case) serves as the catalyst to change. However, Natsu cannot compare to Hana on many levels; it's not nearly as deep as Hana andthe interactions in general are not as impactful. Other people may draw references to Onegai Teacher as there is an alien who would rather not have her identity exposed living with a younger dude. I haven't watched Onegai Teacher yet so I'll leave the commentary on that part for others.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you're watching this it ought to be able to stand on it's own, rather than in the shadow of previous greats. Whether this series does this or not will depend on what you're looking for. It does not have a deep, unraveling mystery/past as in Ano Hana; it does not have the most appealing character designs; and it can be very slow at times. However, the series does have a ton of character interactions and one of the highest confession rates per episode that I've ever recorded. If you're looking for a relation-based series with some whacky alien/Men in Black elements then this is your series. Just don't expect outlandish amounts of ecchi as another story about making a movie *cough Ichigo*.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nLet me be frank, the character designs in this series (in addition to the \"movie-making theme\") were enough for me to sideline this series until multiple groups started picking it up. The protagonist looks like a music composer, like the type of dude you think no one could fall for, and yet he has the attention of multiple girls. I'm not too fond of the design choice for Ichika as well, though that got a bit better with time. Kanna just looks like a little brat... You also have a little alien mascot named Rinon who adds some occasional humor points while somehow reminding me of those moving solar-powered flowers.\\n\\n\r\nThe series takes place primarily in a rural town, with a short multi-episode adventure to Okinawa, so expect a lot of calming greenery. Overall colors are a bit on the saturated side but not to the point of annoyance. What is really confusing is that the show becomes wildly action-heavy in the last two episodes, which makes it really clash with the calming nature of the early episodes. The action itself is mild at best, nothing to be awed over. As for skin, having just finished Maken Ki this seems pretty light. The majority of the ecchi occurs in Kaito's perverted little imagination.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP is okay, I think it would be better without the electronic organ but the overall tune isn't all that appealing. The ED is a bit more even paced and fits well; they even occasionally do the ED fade-in at the end of the episode. The BGM is completely forgettable and often works against your goal of not falling asleep.\\n\\n\r\nVA-wise I'd say the performance was fairly average. Rinon probably has the most enjoyable roll out of all the characters, and Yukari Tamura probably had the hardest time voicing the mysterious, deep laugh of Remon.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nLike in Ano Hana, a character comes to our favorite rural, middle-of-nowhere town in Japan to find something in her memory. This time, rather than a promise, the character is looking for a particular landscape etched in her memory. However, whereas the memory is central to all the characters involved in Ano Hana, the memory is fairly incidental to the other characters here.\\n\\n\r\nSo an alien crash lands, and has to save a boy who happened to be caught in the landing. Instant girlfriend? Not quite. It all gets complicated when you realize that there are lots of strings attached between virtually ALL the primary and secondary cast, it will take the entire season for most of these relationships to unravel, and these served as my primary reason for chaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a bit non-linear compared to others in the genre but still has predictable elements, you can bet that finding the landscape in Ichika's memory will trigger a \"conclusion\" flag. While there is a lot of character exposition and interaction in the show, the actual main plot doesn't start on the rising action until quite late in the series, at which point it starts to feel just a tad rushed. There's also a bit of a Sailor Moon-ish end of first season mode where everyone starts sacrificing themselves in some way so that Ichika can reach her goal, which felt really artificial.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion is interesting. It's one of those that you can guess roughly but can't quite pinpoint how they'd get there. I was surprised that they decided to take a somewhat bittersweet approach + cameo but think that it worked out quite well. The only loose end that the series doesn't quite address well enough is the resolution of all the various relationships built throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe interactions here are what make this series stand apart from some of the other recent shows. Ever had a crush on someone but was never able to get it out? Apparently quite a few of the characters here have that problem, and only with the onset of jealously do these issues get pushed out to the open. The character reactions to situations is very good, as is the portrayal of difficulty in saying what they hide deepest. There were many moments where I just went \"nooooo wayyyy, that did not just happen\", obviously confirmed by a quick rewind.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not quite sure if this series counts as a harem as it is more of a love pentagon as in the case of Hatsukoi Limited rather than a traditional harem (where all girls jump on one dude). This lends itself to a lot more depth than just a bunch of girls fighting over a guy who obviously isn't worth their attention.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I give this series a lot of credit for is sticking to the primary and important secondary characters without introducing unnecessary additional baggage. They do a good job focusing on the very intricate relationships between the primary and supporting characters. By giving the main characters more screen time you also have more time to relate to (or cringe at) them, the level that you feel bonded to the characters will greatly determine how you perceive the final conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nWhile no means a masterpiece, Ano Natsu had some really good points that I think put it above quite a few other shows this season, following the horrific disappointment that was SNS Final. It has a really good character foundation but fails to tightly integrate it with a central story as was the case in Ano Hana. While the character styling isn't terribly attractive, the actual character interactions made it up and them some for me. A pretty good watch considering that I wasn't expecting much.",

            "content": "\"The events of a single summer. Back then, we weren't doing anything, but we wanted to. That's when she showed up and made our summer memorable. Joy and sorrow all joined. That summer, we can never forget.\"\r\nWhen I saw this anime come out, I thought it would be an Onegai Teacher clone that I watched way back in 2002. The premise of this anime also reminded me of AnoHana. Considering these two situations, I came into this anime with low expectations. However, AnoNatsu proved me right and wrong in multiple ways, and that was what made this anime memorable. This is my first anime review,so try not to bash me too much :P SPOILS AHOY.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts out with our protagonist, Kaito, running around with his camera filming random things. As he goes into a soliloquy about his thoughts about death, a spaceship suddenly crash lands near him and death himself knocks him over a railing and invites him into the afterlife. Just before he falls to his death, a girl saves him and he wakes up the next morning with no memory of the incident. The girl, named Ichika, then transfers to his school the very next day, and gets invited by one of Kaito's friends, Tetsurou, to be in a movie with Kaito and the rest of his friends as a fun summer activity. Ichika has nowhere to stay, so Kaito invites her to stay with him. As summer break approaches, drama/romance and the slice of life elements appear.\\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed the story. It described a genuine experience of a group of friends just trying to have fun in the summer. Lemon, a Third-Year student in the same class as Ichika, was the driving force of the group and created most of the comedy in the show, which I really liked. She taught me that  summer is a time for fun activities such as making your friends go batshit insane when they drink a juice and spying on people. The romance was realistic, but I felt like the tension between Ichika and Kaito was dragged out. It was a bit frustrating seeing their relationship either stagnate or fluctuate between awkward and tense. I also felt that after 10 episodes of slow romance, the plot accelerates into Ichika's problem in space. The plot moved too quickly for anyone to understand what's happening after the main couple finally got together. I'd also like a clearer ending than the \"it's up to the audience\" ending that they gave us. Overall, it was an enjoyable story about a group of friends experiencing a memorable summer, but the pacing of story was questionable. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I have nothing much to say here. Vibrant colors, smooth animations, pleasing character designs. J.C. Staff did a good job in the art department, which is surprising considering their past animes' art have been subpar. The only complaint from me is that the art is unoriginal, but it works. One thing I'd like to say is that I felt that the artists focused more on the setting than the actual characters, but maybe that's just me :P\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I must hand it to AnoNatsu, they did a great fucking job at this. The background music was actually memorable with upbeat acoustics. But the thing that pushed AnoNatsu's sound department to a 9/10 is the OP and ED. the opening, \"sign\" by Ray, was cute and upheld a feeling of anticipation (for summer). But what stole the show for me was the ED, \"Vidro Moy\u014d\" by Nagi Yanagi. This song plays during the emotional climax of each episode, and believe me, it made a HELL of an impact on my feels. The feelings I felt while the song played drove me from a smile to tears. It was THAT good. I can't give them enough credit for the sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter ( 7.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nI felt that the two main characters, Kaito and Ichika, were unoriginal. Even though their romance is well-written, the characters themselves feel uninteresting. Even with Ichika being an alien ( This isn't a spoiler because you find out immediately), it still didn't interest me because her personality and development was typical. The side characters stole the show for me. Kanna was funny and charming in the beginning, but became a strong character in the end. Tetsurou was the typical guy sidekick in the beginning, but became more relatable and memorable as the series continued. Mio was just an average and shy girl in the beginning, but it is later revealed that she is more than meets the eye, and I was impressed with her character development. Finally, Lemon-senpai was just so fucking hilarious that I couldn't dislike her. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) \\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here. The story was good even though the pacing could use some work, the characters were genuine and pleasing, and the sound was amazing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\\n",

Why I like Ano Natsu de Matteru is because it has a great love story in it. I also like the idea of the anime to haver a effect that looked like it was filmed with the old camera like Kaito has. I think it also has a little slice of life in it at the end because it tells us that memories are some the best things we have andit really touched my heart. My only dislike is the ending they left it at a cliff hanger when the main characters graduate they leave behind a film which we see of about 10 seconds (SPOILER ALERT DONT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCH IT ALL !) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nwe then are shown that Ichkia returns and that's all we now as she is saying her spaceship has broken down again\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n(SPOILERS ARE DONE)\\n\r\nI would recommend this to everyone !! one of my top ten favourites in my books plz watch Ano Natsu de Matteru !!",

            "content": "\"To wait for something you can't have, is equivalent to death\"\r\nAno Natsu tells the story of an estranged boy, who over the course of a summer, fell deeply in love with an alien. Yes, an alien.\r\nSo, what so special about Ano Natsu? Compared to other romantic dramas, it's a class of one. The momentum of the anime is dreadfully slow throughout, but like a sprint, the last few episodes surged the ideals of the anime towards the surface, and ends up leaving the viewer a sense of emptiness, and fulfilment. But like a sprint, majority of the anime was spent building underlying ideas, which byitself is insignificant to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story: a guy who loves to take photos was one night, mysteriously killed. The opening paragraph of the anime builds a sense of 'wtf' into the viewer - Not many anime starts off having the main protagonist killed after all. But like all Sherlock Holme novels, it paved the way for the entire storyline. In my opinion, what the producers established was a strong, no-bullshit, bond between the characters. His revival after 3 or so minutes into the anime continues the 'wtf happened' feeling within the viewer, needless to say, this helped the viewer to linger around longer. As the first episode progressed, you get more and more drawn into the world of Ano Natsu. Questions are thrown impatiently at you, and none of the answers are present, and you are forced to watch, and watch, and watch, until the dreadful 25th min approaches. The cliffhanger. You wait a full week to advance, to know what happened, yet the questions remain unanswered. \\n\\n\r\nOn a certain level, that is the best way to keep ratings high for the first couple, if not, few weeks. To start the anime on such a high momentous way was clever, but it also meant the high would die down very soon. \\n\\n\r\nAfter the 4th or so episode, it settles into its 'filler' like regime. Slow, time-unmoving actions that on the face of it, seemed insignificant. But the anime is clever, subtle hints are buried in the episodes. They were preparing for the big finale. \\n\\n\r\nObviously I cannot tell you the end, however, like I previously mentioned, I can tell you that the 'dullness' of the middle is compensated by the explosive finish. I cannot help but feel a sense of awe and emptiness at the same time. Happy yet sad, not that the story's finished, but sad we're never told ALL the answers. Perhaps we could use our imagination to fill in the gaps? Nevertheless, I had never felt such contrastable feelings all at once. \\n\\n\r\nSo why would you want to watch it? Like a firework, the price you pay for a second of beauty cannot be justified. The commitment you have to have to finish the anime is high, but I assure you, the finish is worth it... at least in my opinion. The first episode will capture your interest, I assure you, but to continue to the end is the challenge. And I hope each and every one of you can overcome this challenge, to enjoy the forever contrasting feelings like I have felt.",

(Drama plays a big role)\r\nStory 8 - It isn't very captivating but as the story progresses it keeps you on the edge of your seat\r\nArt 8 - Absolutely no complains whatsoever, characters look clean and quite realistic in body size especially\r\nSound 7 -Nothing noticeable, more like the music was there for the sake of hearing something. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9 - This is important. This anime has 6 main characters and it sticks with them mostly the whole time. Romance plays a big role as there are actually confessions here and there and a love polygon. Each main character has a trait or specialty which you absolutely adore \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8 - I actually enjoyed this series a hell lot. The ending was EXTREMELY satisfying, the romantic moments were ROMANTIC and the dramatic moments were DRAMATIC. \\n\\n\r\nI recommended this to people who enjoy a romance drama with some comedy anime.",

            "content": "I have been watching anime for 17 years and have almost completely narrowed down the types of anime that I tend to like. I enjoy slice-of-life, romance, a little drama, and a little sci-fi/fantasy thrown in there. But, in the end, the thing that makes an anime great to me is that it leaves a lasting impression on me. There have been only a few anime in my life that have left me sitting there for hours afterwards, just thinking about how amazing it was (Clannad, Honey and Clover, Pet Girl of Sakurasou, Sword Art Online, etc.). Well, this has made my top 5 animelist. And trust me, I've seen a lot. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what makes the show so fantastic. They're emotional, funny, and make me so invested in what's going on. I started watching this show with an indifferent mindset. But, as soon as I got through a couple of episodes, I finished this 12 episode anime in a single sitting. I couldn't stop watching it. That never happens. \\n\\n\r\nIt is also a rather refreshing show as well. The relationship between the two main characters is so, well, non-anime like. Sure, it takes them a while to figure things out. But, when they do, they aren't embarrassed to be a couple. Usually in anime, they are too afraid to hold hands *coughCLANNADcough*. So, this really made me like this anime even more.\\n\\n\r\nI really don't want to spoil anything, so I won't say any more. All I will say is: give this anime a chance. You won't regret it.",

            "content": "This anime exceeded all my expectations. I was expecting it to be a good romance comedy with some Sci-fi, but instead I got to see the best Romance comedy ever! Yes, I even liked it more than Toradora. \r\nArtwork and animation\r\nStrong colours:\r\nhttp://www.japanator.com/elephant/ul/21368-620x-Ano-Natsu-de-Matteru.jpg\r\nnice contrasts: http://randomc.net/image/Ano%20Natsu%20de%20Matteru/Ano%20Natsu%20de%20Matteru%20-%2001%20-%20Large%2002.jpg \r\nnice perspectives (camera angles):\r\nhttp://randomc.net/image/Ano%20Natsu%20de%20Matteru/Ano%20Natsu%20de%20Matteru%20-%2001%20-%20Large%2024.jpg \r\nwell thought out use of light:\r\nhttp://randomc.net/image/Ano%20Natsu%20de%20Matteru/Ano%20Natsu%20de%20Matteru%20-%2001%20-%20Large%2013.jpg \r\nand great attention for detail:\r\nhttp://randomc.net/image/Ano%20Natsu%20de%20Matteru/Ano%20Natsu%20de%20Matteru%20-%2001%20-%20Large%2006.jpg. \r\n   These are all ingredients for good artwork and Ano Natsu has them all. There are animes with better artwork out there, but this one is not far from the top.\r\n   The animation is very good as well. Even though most ofthe time it doesn\u2019t stand out too much, there are moments that make you think: \u2018wow, this was nicely done\u2019. There is also something that I don\u2019t see very often in animes: the way some facial expressions are made is elaborate. The faces don\u2019t always suddenly change, but depending on the situation, you can see different phases in the way the eyes move the mouths form and the hair falls.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot\\n\\n\r\n(\"This part\" is copy paste) \\n\r\n\"While testing his 8mm camera at night, Kaito Kirishima is caught amid a mysterious explosion in his small town. Strangely, Kaito wakes up the next day perfectly fine, but with no recollection of what exactly happened the day before. Unfazed by what seems to have been just a dream, he heads to school not giving much thought to the incident. Discussing with his friends about the camera, they decide to make a movie during summer break. They invite two upperclass students to participate in the project: recently arrived Ichika Takatsuki and the odd Remon Yamano. In a strange twist of fate, Ichika starts living with Kaito as his sister has to work overseas. Summer days are about to get exciting for the small film crew.\"\\n\\n\r\nAfter seeing the first episode I thought: \u2018Ok, so this is a combination of Onegai Sensei, Toradora and Ano Hanna\u2026 Great!\u2019 Then halfway the series I realized this series is not just \u2018a combination\u2019, but a well thought out story with unconventional twists. The Sci-fi element is there, but it is not the best part of the plot. The best part is the way the relationships between the characters are. The filming contributes to the plot in a very good way. In some cases it also helps to emphasize the emotions from the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and their development\\n\\n\r\nKaito, the male protagonist is a very honest, normal high school boy. The honest part is something I really like; it makes him different to many other protagonists of romance comedies. His feelings for Ichika, the female protagonist develop very quickly. Meanwhile, Kanna has obviously a crush on her close friend\u2026 Kaito. Tetsuro and Mio also play important roles in this story, but telling any more would mean giving spoilers. The one character who helps the developments of relationships the most is Remon. She is one of the most interesting characters I\u2019ve seen in anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nActing\\n\\n\r\nIshihara Kaori is a seiyuu who really deserves credits. Both her and Shimazaki Nobunaga had the difficult task to play many emotions and make them sound real. I must say they both succeeded perfectly. I am not easily moved by romantic scenes, but I felt something special every single moment that there was a revelation, a confession or anything that changed the way the characters would see each other. Also to all the seiyuus of the other main characters: Great work!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack (openings and endings included)\\n\\n\r\nThe music composed by I\u2019ve Sound is good and fits the anime well. Not much more to say about it I think.\\n\r\nThe opening is normal, fits the anime just fine, but is nothing extraordinary. The song is nice though =)\\n\r\nThe ending I like better. The song is nice, but what caught my eye was the colour symbolism. Maybe I\u2019m just thinking too much, but I believe the colours of the characters were not just random. \\n",

            "content": "I really don't like this anime very much, the first is the science fiction component. In itself the incipit of the alien that lands on Earth and enjoys the joys of adolescence together with fresh friends of fresh knowledge is not evil: obviously it is anything but original, but it is one of those bases that does not mind having to see used with such high frequency. Of course, for the first half of the series one wonders why this choice turned to sci-fi, given that, except for some occasional reference, the female protagonist is an alien does not have who knows what great influencesand interests in the unfolding of the narrated events. Then, abruptly violent and bombastic, the sci-fi is the master in the last episodes, in a whirlwind of sentinel robots, spaceships, MIBs, interplanetary travels, galactic alliances and spatial norms. In short, that this component is considered in the series there may also be, but that its presence has such a downturn, and returns to be used so heavily after some time in which it was almost completely silenced, well, in my opinion turns out to be a poor choice, which I don't agree with and which I really don't like.\\n\r\nThe second is the vicious circle of romantic relationships between the characters. Now, accustomed to the usual love triangle, at most quadrilateral, used to exhaustion in every scholastic-sentimental comedy, dealing with something different can also be there. A touch of originality and refinement, if well balanced, is always welcome. I find, however, that with this sort of pentagon \"she loves him who loves her who loves him who loves her\" has put too much in the fire. Certainly one has the opportunity to study with greater ease the array of feelings of each individual character and to impersonate oneself now in that now in that other, but personally I think it turns out to be a somewhat exaggerated and exasperated choice, which sometimes knows a little about forced and cumbersome. Something more slender, less demanding, perhaps less original, I admit but equally acceptable, it would have been a less burdensome and burdensome choice, but it could still have led to something good without necessarily losing out.",
