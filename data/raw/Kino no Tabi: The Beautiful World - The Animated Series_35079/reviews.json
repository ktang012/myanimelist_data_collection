            "content": "Keichii Sigsawa's 'Kino no Tabi (Kino's Journey) The Beautiful World' is one of the longest running ongoing Light Novel series in existence, generally releasing a whole volume of material every year since 2000. In that time it has received first an Anime adaptation in 2003 directed by the late Ryutaro Nakemura, and this 2017 adaptation by Studio Lerche. For fairness, I will not try to compare this version to its source material or the previous adaptation too much and try to judge it based on its own merit.\r\nThe premise of the series is that it follows the Journey of a traveller named Kino and theirtalking Motorrad Hermes through their travels across a world made up of small countries which each encompass their own unique ideologies, cultures, and traditions. From this, Sigsawa uses the perspective of Kino, a traveller with no ties to a particular culture of their own and a maintained neutral outlook on the morally grey activities which they often come across, to look at multiple  facets of philosophy and the human condition. This results in a very interesting and thought provoking episodic series, whatever its incarnation.\\n\r\nWhile this will be a positive review overall, as I did find more to enjoy about this adaptation than I didn't, I will start this review off discussing the negatives of the series first, as they are perhaps the more glaring issue with this adaptation, and the one which may turn potential viewers (be they familiar with the source material or not) off.\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the adaptation is without a doubt the stories that were adapted for this versions. For those of you who didn't know, the stories from the LN selected for this adaptation were picked from a poll in which fans of the LN were asked to vote for their favourite stories from the series. While this may sound like a good idea on paper, as it means we get to see what the fans themselves picked as the highlights, sort of like making the series a Band's Greatest Hits compilation which can in turn help to entice new viewers, the issue comes about when the stories placed near each other cause the series to feel extremely uneven.\\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is that in the original source material, these stories would have been written in the order they were for a reason. That becomes apparent when we see how tonally conflicting the series can be, as the episodes can often be radically different in terms of tone so that one week we witness a deep and quite dark study of the way that humans take their lives for granted but then next week get a silly, action packed episode. This often extreme tonal dissonance which occurs between the stories can often feel jarring, and lead to the feeling that the series suffers a severe identity crisis in which it doesn't quite know what it's trying to be as a series.\\n\r\nIt doesn't help also that some of the stories in the series perhaps aren't what I would have selected as being among my favourites. The worst offender perhaps being an episode which is itself a compilation of short stories which each feel insufferably self parodying and painful to watch (this is episode 9 in case I've convinced you to skip this episode when you watch).\\n\r\nAnother major problem with the series is the direction it takes. Lerche are  a studio whose work I'm only familiar with from this year, and from what I can gather, the popular consensus seems to be that they're an extremely uneven studio, and that certainly reflects in this adaptation, which additionally serves as a showcase for both the studio's strengths and weaknesses. They certainly aren't a studio known for subtlety for one thing, and when the series does try to showcase its more philosophical side by showcasing the actions of people within the societies that exist in this world, their emotions and negative reactions to things which dilute their customs can sometimes feel a bit overblown, not helping is some really overacting VA work for those characters. This can unfortunately cause the side characters to feel a bit like caricatures, and the way such scenes are so sporadically directed to have some sort of dynamic breakdown suddenly occur can often lead to it looking a tad more silly than it was possibly intended.\\n\r\nAdditionally, the studio's trademark heavily saturated lighting can sometimes cause the colour pallet to feel overblown and processed, and this becomes an issue when it subtracts from any atmosphere the story in question is trying to convey, and for those with more sensitive eyes can perhaps look a bit ugly when it is done wrong. That said, this lighting effect when done right can actually help to enhance the atmosphere in some episodes, and make some genuinely lovely background art which brings the world of the series to life, looking appropriately Beautiful as the title implies.\\n\r\nNow, with these admittedly very large issues of inconsistent story quality and sometimes harmful directorial choices, I will say that the series is actually good overall, when it manages to overcome these issues.  More specifically, when the strength of the source material is able to shine through in the stronger episodes. For me, these would include episodes 1, 4, 5, 6 & 10.  Each of these episodes appeal to the main strength of the series, a frank look at philosophy and the human condition, sometimes told through a surprisingly dark and chilling lens which invites the viewer to reflect and think about the morality of what just transpired.\\n\r\nOn the side of characters, Kino and Hermes are of course the main characters of the series, travelling across the world with a neutral stance towards the (often terrifying) events they encounter which in turn helps us the audience to view them with a similar lens. Unfortunately, there's pretty much nothing in terms of development for the main character as a slight result of that aforementioned episode order, with the possible exception of episode 10.\\n\r\nAdding fuel to the fire is the addition of episodes which don't feature Kino as the main character, as we also see stories told primarily through the perspectives of other travellers who Kino met on their journey, such as their mentor, and Shizu; the former prince of a dead kingdom who travels with a talking dog, and later a unique child. These characters are likeable enough on their own, and does provide a counterbalance by looking through the different perspectives of characters who lack Kino's neutral ideology and solve situations differently from how they would, but it does become a problem in the second half of the series when their episodes dominate and cause  Kino to feel almost insignificant in their own series.\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, I already discussed the advantages and disadvantages of Lerche's heavily saturated lighting. The animation looks fine for the most part, though it does look fairly safe, there's nothing much unique about it. Some people criticised this change in artistic style from the 2003 adaptation, but this ignores the fact that Sigsawa's own illustrations for the series have changed through the years he has been working on the series. The 2003 version reflected the designs he used at that time, while this version reflects his current artstyle, so it isn't really \"betraying the source material\" as many said.\\n\r\nThe OST isn't particularly grabbing, while some of the side characters do overact a bit, the voice acting is generally fine for the most part, with Aoi Yuuki being typically lovely as the voice of the main character, and Inori Minase providing an appropriate mix of nervousness and calm to her one-off character. The OP and ED are both quite lovely (and evidently where most of the animation resources were allocated above all else) capturing the more calm and tranquil aspects of the series, as well as its serene sense of beauty.\\n\r\nPerhaps the most frustrating conclusion I have come to in this review is that I still don't quite know who I'd recommend this series to. I suppose if you consider yourself a \"Super fan\" of the source material you should at least try it, outside of that it becomes a bit trickier, as I've seen from the community mixed responses to the series, some newcomers feeling unmotivated by it, others enjoying it, and similarly mixed opinions from fans of the 2003 adaptation. I will say that if you're a newcomer, the 2003  adaptation is probably a better bet to go on, as it has a much more consistent tone and represents the strengths of the source material in a much more solid way by ignoring some of the sillier storylines that pop up in this version. And check out this adaptation after that if you feel you can tolerate it.\\n\r\nAs I said before, despite this adaptation's glaring faults, its uneven quality, I still found it to be a fairly faithful adaptation of the source material. Especially in those stronger episodes that I highlighted. And it does reveal many of its cracks, especially in the second half of the series, but for what it was, and for those episodes I liked, I do give it credit.",

            "content": "A Masterpiece anime is rare to find and it's specially rare nowadays since the shows mostly focus on bad harems and shitty romance but sometimes a new season comes out and there is that one anime that is just beautiful and tho they don't come every season but i'm happy to say that this season had two of those, Kino and Net-juu.\r\nKino is an episodic SOL anime with a dark tone which isn't really everyone's cup of tea but it sure as hell is mine, you start with Kino and Hermes (The mottorad) traveling to a new country with every episode being a unique andgreat well-thought out story, you get to see all different kinds of people with different culture and ways of thinking which is the very basis of this anime, i mean it is called Kino no tabi the beautiful journey for a reason, the reason people don't like this is that they try to logic out every thing based on how they feel or how they think but even in real life there are places with a fucked-up way of thinking that they consider normal and the same way around so just deal with what is present to you and you would surely enjoy this much much more.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great from the main cast to all other side characters with each of them being unique with great characteristics and not just repetition or flat characters like in most SOL being produced now.\\n\r\nThe voice actors were great and even though i liked the old voice of kino, the new one still does a phenomenal job of portraying kino's feelings. \\n\r\nThe art is great and that was one of the things i was worried about since almost all anime uses CGI horribly and the art seems inconsistent so i'm happy to say (aside from some parts in episode 12) the art is very consistent and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nWhen they announced a new season i was worried that it was going to turn into some moe-shit anime like most sol anime now so i'm happy to see this remake being as good as the original with it's new added stories.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a hint at a new season at the end which is very nice to see tbh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a solid 10/10.\\n\r\nWould recommend to even Non-anime fans.",

            "content": "Life is a journey and the road ahead is filled with a lot of obstacles that we must overcome to reach our final destination......\r\nFirst of all this is not a sequel for the old Kino it's a remake with some changes for the art style , plot and story which i will mention them in this review.So let's go on a journey then....\r\nThe first 2 episodes despite being bland their purpose is to get the viewer used to the plot, story and characters and captivate your attention with the improved animation and scenery(landscape). After those 2 episodes things get better and some episodes will leavea good impression after finishing this series.The story is simple and relaxing following Kino on his motorrad through his journey from a country to another meeting different people and learning about each country's customs and culture during his 3 days stay. A variety of themes are explored and morals to learn from them at the end of each episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are better explored in this series especially the side characters who get a spotlight in some episodes (the focus is not only on Kino like in the old series) which is a strong point and brings a lot of diversity to the story and plot. The visuals are gorgeous and the scenery is very captivating and this is an essential factor for the main concept of this show.An interesting fact from this show is how they portrayed the bond between motorrads&travelers and presented both of their perspectives about the meaning of a journey. \\n\\n\r\nOne big problem this show has are some episodes who lack substance and don't manage to get the viewer attached to the characters and story.For example they should explored more about the characters backgrounds and how they end up in that situation instead the presentation is rushed and it leaves a dry taste in your mouth after finishing an episode. Although the old Kino did a better job at that the remake has some remarkable episodes that will surely become your favorites.\\n\\n\r\nThe scenery, ost and animation are superior and for those who enjoy those stuff from an anime if the old Kino didn't seem appealing to you this remake will surely captivate you , especially the opening song animation having a rich visual vocabulary and innovative concepts. So my advice is to give it a try and don't binge it you need to take your time with this show and enjoy each minute from it. \\n",

            "content": "\"The world is not beautiful, therefore it is.\"\r\nThis review will be based sorely on the 2017 remake/reimagining of Kino's Journey, while references to the original 2003 will be debatable as well.\r\nTo boot, the original series was a cult classic to people who have watched it, and the reboot by studio Lerche this year made a good transition with the visuals and music, and personally and honestly this is a good watch even if it's action-packed, adventurous SoL.\r\nThis is the story of Kino and her motorrad Hermes, on an episodic journey to showcase the countries they have been to: its characteristics and what makes it standout for the country, even if for the citizens of the respective countries they come from.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I wouldn't go so far as to call the 2017 version a reboot of Kino's Journey, but like as mentioned, a reimagining with sprinkles of the original anime mixed into the substance as well, and I kinda quite liked the direction it took, even if some scenes were hard to understand and swallow.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe simple Kino, her adaptation of the name from a traveler of the same name who got murdered (Episode 11 spoilers) riding along with her motorrad Hermes, both characters take the cake for being the main \"protagonists\" of the show. I say it that kind of way because the show's narration doesn't quite explicitly focus on them all the time, but then it's still fascinating to see how Kino survives with Hermes on the journeys of good and bad and getting a fine taste of what's to come.\\n\\n\r\nAnd also, this time we have another set of people: Shizu and Riku (from Episode 6) whose intention is the same: to travel around and experience life that's a journey. Unfortunately, I feel like their on-screen time could have been given a bit more than just 2 or 3 episodes, even if their plot started out a bit later. Unlike Kino, Shizu is more regressed and too also has a heart of gold, with the dog companion Riku, they both make good progress with their lives too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series doesn't need to overshine the main and supporting characters, but they at least get the job done for showcasing a simple, yet intriguing series that keeps you on your toes.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nAgain, Lerche has done great on the series, albeit that most people prefer the original due to nostalgia. The truth is that while this series has nothing new to offer, it at least got an upgrade to the visuals and music (which I'll discuss later). For a world that's portrayed as \"not being beautiful, therefore it is\", the environment looks lush and beautiful and could not go any further. But with that said, some liberties are taken directly from the original source material, but it's honestly not too bad. Surprisingly enough, I did notice a fair share of lack in quality, but it quickly overshadows that with the immersive story. Another job well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis might be the 1st of a few times where I actually like Yanagi Nagi's music composition with the OP and ED, it sticks out in a very melodious atmosphere, and honestly it could not get any better than this. Her music makes you feel like you're experiencing something totally new and fresh, and that's how I like how she portrays the surrounding and makes the sound of music combine with the visuals to give it a good-sounding edge over the rest of the other shows out there. Overall, high praises for the music and BGM, the reason why it compels me to watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAs mentioned, there's some debate over this and the original to further extent, and I don't blame anyone for it, because we do share our own opinions and have a liking for the ones we love. With that said, Kino's Journey -The Beautiful World- 2017 reimagining is one show from Fall 2017 not to be overlooked, even if the aesthetics do fall apart at times and have people overwhelmed by how it sticks out like a sore thumb to the original. I personally liked the calming atmosphere, and it is truly one of the great shows of the season.",

            "content": "Do not be fooled, this is NOT a sequel to the first season made back in 2003. This season is a remake.\r\nStory: (8/10)\r\nAs of episode six there is not much to the story but it is simple. The main character goes from country to country in what seems to be a post apocalyptic world. The world is very separated and each country she visits seems to harbor something new and unexpected. This story tells of her adventures as she travels with her talking motorbike named Hermes. She meets dangerous and humble strangers and learns new ways of life.\r\nArt: (9/10)\r\nAs the world is \"anything but beautiful\"the animation proves otherwise. I enjoy watching the animation and it is a key reason why I was interested in the series before initially knowing what it was about. It is a \"sight for sore eyes.\" Especially the opening and ending themes, the art style is my favorite.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8/10)\\n\r\nThe music is simply touching and really adds to each moment. I enjoy listening to the music. There are also nature sounds we hear through a lot of scenes which rather just adds the nice touch factor.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (8/10)\\n\r\nSo far there are just two main characters Kino and Hermes. They are really shrouded in mystery along with the world around them. Kino is a very like able character and I enjoy seeing what she has up her sleeve next. She is actually quite bad ass. She may look tiny but she has a big will to fight. I can tell that there is something in her past that inepts her to keep traveling.\\n\\n\r\nHermes is a motorbike, with a personality and a voice?? Yeah, I know, weird. But I like it and I wouldn't want it any other way. Hermes is Kino's companion on her travels. We do not know much about their ways but to me it seems they are inseparable.\\n\\n\r\nWe end up meeting a few characters here and there that Kino becomes acquainted with during her travels. It seems a lot of my questions about them will go unanswered. I enjoy the slight hint of mystery behind these humble strangers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10)\\n\r\nI enjoy watching this series. There is nothing I don't like about it so far. There is subtle humor sprinkled in to each episode that I love. I hope you give this anime a chance. I have hopes my curiosity becomes inspiration as the series develops. It is quite the fascinating world!",

            "content": "Note: I have not watched the original season that came out in 2003. Also minor spoilers.\r\nUpon reading the synopsis for this show after viewing the fourth episode, I discovered two things. Firstly, that Kino is a girl (wowz), and secondly, that anthropomorphism doesn't just extend to slapping on a pair of boobs on anything non-human.\r\nAnyhow, people seem to be praising this show as one of the hidden gems of this season, and after checking out a couple of episodes, it's not hard to see why. The main lead doesn't yell obnoxiously every few seconds, her clothes don't explode after she eats something, and the significantlack of edge in the show is truly refreshing. Does this mean that this show is devoid of flaws, though?\\n\\n\r\nWell, no.\\n\\n\r\n\"\"Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - The Animated Series\" is an episodic show, meaning that each episode is more or less stand-alone and you can watch it in any order you like. What makes this show interesting is that it explores the possible ways countries which have questionable laws - say, allowing theft - function. The studio behind this show, Lerche, has done a pretty decent job on the audiovisuals. The backgrounds are well animated, and the soundtrack reflects the \"beautiful world\" theme nicely. Although, I think that the focus of this show leans more towards the people which inhabit these strange countries rather than the landscapes.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to my main point of criticism. Some of the episodes so far focus heavily on human drama. However, this is only effective if the characters involved in this drama are properly developed and fleshed out. If not, how can you evoke any sort of emotional response from the audience? Usually, this isn't much of a problem for a show, but \"Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - The Animated Series\" just so happens to be episodic. This means that entire, complex backstories are reduced to one or two minutes of continuous exposition, usually done by our friendly neighborhood talking bike(God knows how it found the information in the first place). I'd also like to see some more character development on our two main leads, but since only four episodes have come out, it's not too big of a problem. Yet.\\n\\n\r\nBy the looks of things, this series will end up as a fairly decent one, but not anything outstanding. However, I genuinely enjoyed the episodes which solely involved Kino and Hermes exploring some weird country. If more of the following episodes don't involve any crazy drama, this might end up as one of the best shows of the season.",

            "content": "To say this remake of Kino's Journey is a disappointment would be an understatement. The original 2003 series was a hidden gem of the decade that depicted a series of short stories that were parables focused on elements of the human condition observed through the traveler, Kino. The stories tended to vary in their mood and intensity, being either bizarre, insightful, or having a dark and twisted element to them. In spite of the changing moods, the 2003 Kino's Journey adaptation did a great job with balancing them out with exploring both the joys and pains of being human.\r\nThis remake sadly lacks the subtlety andnuances that made its 2003 counterpart a pleasure to watch. The stories for this remake are more blatant in exploring the moral they are focused on and many of them seemed to lack the time to allow the viewer to be immersed into exploring the various lands visited by Kino, thus reducing the impact of when the true side of the visited country gets revealed. The story order also felt more disjointed as several episodes of this series shifted over to exploring other characters like the swordsman, Shizu, and the slave girl, Photo. While interesting characters in their own right, there's little further elaborated on with Shizu following his introduction and Photo only has a single episode devoted to her. But perhaps the worst element to this adaptation of Kino's Journey is the series often getting too immersed into showing off action when Kino and Shizu get into any sort of major conflict. Said action scenes mostly have nothing to do with exploring the moral of each of its episodic stories beyond showing off the anime's animation and goes against the whole point of Kino's Journey about the series as a whole being moral-focused parables with an occasional cruel twist. Anyone who has seen the 2003 adaptation of Kino will notice the rather jarring difference in story mood, focus, and presentation choices as some episodes for this remake adapt stories also featured in the 2003 anime like the Coliseum arc and the Land of Adults story.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real praise that I can give this remake of Kino's Journey is the improved artwork over the original series. There is greater detail put into character designs and scenic shots are more pleasing on the eyes. Animation is also more fluid for the most part with more natural movement depicted with characters, especially noticeable during the anime's action scenes. In spite of the improved animation though, the use of CG animation still sticks out badly compared to the regular animation and is quite noticeable at points where complicated animated sequences are depicted, particularly whenever Kino is riding on Hermes. Also in terms of a presentation choice for a series like Kino, the more detailed and brightly-colored visuals don't mesh well with a series like Kino that is more focused on exploring the morals each story has to offer up on an element of the human condition.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say Kino's Journey 2017 easily makes for the biggest disappointment I have for an anime series this year. In spite of its improved visuals, it felt like Lerche did not have a clue on what made Kino's Journey an enjoyable series during its 2003 run as there were points where it felt like the series was unsure over what it wanted to focus on and then when making the effort to explore a moral, the focus of it felt forced and lacked the subtlety and impact offered from its original series. If you want a better option at seeing how Kino's Journey could be adapted in animated form, I strongly suggest checking out the 2003 series over this subpar adaptation for it.",

            "content": "I personally like Kino's design and yay! for the \"rare\" female protagonist! But that alone shouldn't be the deciding factor. \r\nJumping straight to the story;\r\nI've watched \"a few\" episodes of the 2003 version and I would say that I prefer the reboot (2017 version). I dropped the 2003 version after a few episodes because I didn't really like how they did the show.\r\nIn the 2003 version, I personal found that the stories were a bit \"too vague\" (with morals neither here nor there...verging more towards negative I would say), not to mention that Kino was acting indifferent even in the face of injustice (not sureabout later episodes of the 2003 version). The 2003 version seems to be pushing this thing about humans being immoral/evil, and \"that's just how humans are and we should let them be\"...which I'm strongly against. Well, I guess that's to be expected from the theme of the show which is \"The world is not beautiful, therefore it is.\"\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure about others, but I find that Kino and Hermes in the 2003 version quite annoying as most of their dialogues seemed pretty empty and at some points had questionable morals and reasoning...\\n\\n\r\nPros of the 2017 version as a standalone:\\n\r\n- Kino having more depth as a moralistic person. I like how in this version it clearly shows what Kino is okay with and what she's not okay with. Thankfully, so far (up to ep 5) there hasn't been any questionable reasoning by Kino.\\n\\n\r\n- Hermes says questionable things once in awhile but I'm glad that the show made it clear that its just Hermes's point of view as a motorrad / machine. \\n\\n\r\n- I like how this show highlights humans being evil and that oftentimes criminals/evil people should be gotten rid-of to maintain peace.\\n\\n\r\nCons of the 2017 version as a standalone:\\n\r\n- Kino seems somewhat overpowered at times compared to the average civilian but then again there are some other characters in the show which are somewhat overpowered as well...so I guess I could just brush it off as something that just goes on in Kino's universe, as in if you're skilled, you're going to be somewhat super skilled at times.. Thankfully most of the time it's done somewhat realistically.\\n\\n\r\n- Some episodes feel empty. As in it works as a story but doesn't have much meaning behind it.\\n\\n\r\n- There are some logic holes here and there. Thankfully not much.\\n\\n\r\n- Oddly enough, Kino's sex seems to be a \"thing\" in this reboot. I'm not sure why as it just seems off... Well I guess that's to be expected when most people seem to be really into finding out what genitalia a person has...and assuming that they would act differently based on certain preconceptions about their sex...\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment:\\n\r\nI'm still enjoying it for now because it's rare for a show to highlight corrupted humans and actually encourage getting rid of them. And I personally enjoy watching Kino in action XD. Hopefully the show continues to be decent. \\n\\n\r\nRating: Wanted to give 10, because it's rare and hard to find a show doing well when it comes to human nature and morality... but sadly there are some major logic flaws in some episodes... So it'll be a 9 for me.\\n\\n",

            "content": "***Very mild spoilers for both this series and the original 2003 Kino's Journey***\r\ntl;dr The 2017 version takes the mantra \"The world is not beautiful, therefore it is\" and crushes it under the wheels of a thousand horribly-animated 3D-CG motorrads.\r\nWhy a 1/10? Why does this show deserve such a low score? Easy: There is no reason to watch it. The 2003 version is simply better than the 2017 version in every conceivable way\u2014in story, art direction, music, themes, characters, memorability, and quality. This remake offers no new original ideas, no compelling storylines, and no interesting allegories that made the original so beloved. Kino herself has beengutted as a character and replaced with a hollow husk of her former self\u2014a change that is sadly emblematic of the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nIt is predictable, boring, trite, and utterly unambitious. The heart and soul of Kino's Journey has been lobotomized in favour of a new glitz-ified \"more accessible\" version where the cardboard cutouts that pass themselves off as characters yell and scream and flail about in typical anime fashion. At no point does this show strike you with the 2003 version's sense of awe, yet this feels more like purposeful laziness rather than trying yet failing to clear the (admittedly high) bar set by the original.\\n\\n\r\nEverything in New Kino is handed to the viewer on an all-too-obvious silver platter. Not only are the complex philosophical issues of Old Kino missing, but there is no distinctive style: every background is overly glossy, every shot is staid and lazily-composed, and every frame of animation feels chintzy. Gone are the days where Kino riding Hermes around the countryside was given the dignity of normal 2D animation. The plot is an incoherent mess, with bizarre twists and turns coming out of thin air (seemingly having been drawn out of a hat at random). For all the extra characters and storylines the 2017 version introduces, none is particularly memorable, unique, or skillfully executed, and everything culminates in a thoroughly ridiculous and poorly-animated final episode so laughably bad it deserves a place in the Anime Notoriety Hall of Fame alongside Inferno Cop and School Days.\\n\\n\r\nTake the first episode of both versions. Old Kino presented a poignant, in-depth discussion of transhumanism, the nature of human interactions/relationships, the emotional toll of living out one's life in light of past mistakes, and whether science can/should try to rectify social/interpersonal problems\u2014all wrapped up in a tightly-executed and stylishly-directed 20 minutes. New Kino has a story where Kino arrives at a country, talks to some people for no reason, witnesses someone die in a cartoonish lynch-mob, and leaves. Neither she nor the viewer has learned anything about the country or morality or ethics or human nature at all. \\n\\n\r\nWhat is the point of this show? Why take a well-known, well-established series and strip it of all meaningful content? Where is the subtext, the subtlety, and the quiet contemplation that made the 2003 version such a classic? And if it is argued that Kino's Journey doesn't HAVE to have these things, the 2017 version does a fine job proving that Kino's Journey definitely cannot survive without them. The characters and world of Kino\u2019s Journey are much more one-dimensional and generic compared to other shows where such things are the main emphasis and appeal. The real quality of Old Kino was never found in the plot or characters per se, but rather in how it used them to present its philosophy and allegorical commentaries on society, humanity and the world as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nIs this show any worse than other shows this year? Probably not, but it all depends on what you value as a viewer. If you want mediocre brainless schlock, Kino's Journey 2017 is definitely for you. If you want something meaningful, something that stands out and makes you think, skip this and watch the original.",

            "content": "Note: I have not read the source material (novel), nor watch the previous anime adaptation, so this review will be based on the 2017 adaptation alone.\r\nKino no Tabi follows the titular Kino and her motorcycle Hermes as they travel from country to country. The appeal of the series supposedly based on the uniqueness of each country they visit, rather than some overarching grand adventure, so apart from some recurring characters, there is very little connection between the episodes, and indeed from what I heard it\u2019s neither in the order of the original novel, nor in the order of the previous adaptation.\r\nTherefore the enjoyment of theseries rests on how interesting or thought provoking each individual country/story is. While I had high expectations , in general the stories fell rather flat for me. A couple of them could probably be considered \u201cmemorable\u201d, but most range from mediocre to forgettable. And even the memorable ones are hardly masterpieces, just more unique than the rest.\\n\r\nThis is not helped by the fact that each story has to be either one episode or half an episode long, which makes some of them feel slow and drawn out, while others feel too fast and hurried. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending, however, was just... bad. I'm not really how sure how they can close of a series in this format, but episode 11 seems like a much more fitting ending than 12, which consists of bizarre story followed by Kino murmuring half-asleep about where travel begin and ends. It's just... completely anti-climatic.\\n\\n\r\nKino travels through a myriad of different settings, from rural to urban, from ancient to modern, from land to sea. It could have been a great visual feast, but instead Kino no Tabi choose to use a drab, faded, one-look-fits-all type of feel. It works in the sense that the world feels coherent despite the different settings, however it takes away the uniqueness of each different country, and make them all feel like clones with minor adjustments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter animation is somewhat stable, however there are serious problems with certain animated sequences, particularly the 3D ones -- oftentimes the framerate is so bad that it feels like watching a slideshow rather than an animation. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP, ED, and OST as a whole is largely forgettable, and nothing from the OST even pops into mind. It's just... bland and boring like most of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I\u2019d probably rate the best stories 8/10, and the worst ones 3/10, and the ending 1/10. The series as a whole would sit somewhere at 5/10.",

            "content": "Doing reboots, remakes, or any sort of revival of a certain work always seems to be an insurmountable task for just about any creator. It becomes sort of a balancing act where to the fans, the work doesn\u2019t stray too far from the original that it loses the point of the original was all about, and it isn\u2019t too similar that it feel like a rehash of what has been done before. It feels the need to appease old fans without blocking out new fans, and open up to new fans without insulting the old fans. When it comes to Kino\u2019s journey, well it comesdown right in the middle of all these and maybe thanks duely to the source material that the show proves to be a competent yet vapid dud.\\n\\n\r\nDepending on how you look at it kino\u2019s journey is either a remake or re-adaptation of the 2003 anime or light novel, respectively. The series follows a motorist and her talking motorcycle as they travel around to diffrent counties, which serve more as walled city-states than actual countries. Kino only stays in each country for 3 days and 2 nights which most of the story is focused on. As each country is truly unique on its own as each one fluctuates when it comes to technology, culture, and ideologies, so in one instance they can be in a futuristic country and in another they can be in a pseudo early-industrial europe. The world of Kino\u2019s journey isn\u2019t interested in constructing a cohesive world, but rather create small vignettes to look into different ideas, ethics, and purposes in life.  With the residents of each country, or just about any character serving as mouthpiece for some sort of idea. While kino serves as a stand in for the viewers as an observer for the events that happen in almost each episode. The shows are episodic in nature, and it usually goes comes full circle within or across an episode/s. However while this show does stay true to what kino is about, there are several aspects that it fails which the 2003 kino\u2019s journey did better.Now don\u2019t take this as me being nostalgic over the original show since i only watched a bit of it when i was younger, and only got around to finishing it this year. \\n\\n\r\nSince kino\u2019s journey is an episodic series with no clear overarching structure the show had the ability to tread new ground. Which it did as the show ventured into new countries, and meet new people. Yet at the same time it also has episodes where it retreads over what the previous show did. It\u2019s because of this that i can\u2019t help but compare the two shows, and why this series isn\u2019t at the same level as it\u2019s predecessor. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this version of kino is more polished when it comes to its production value, the same can\u2019t be said about its writing. The show comes off as predictable as the end result or at least how the show will pan out can be seen way before the halfway point. While being predictable isn\u2019t a bad thing, it starts to become very weary after each episode. It\u2019s also because of its predictability of the show that it starts lacks any sort of driving point to any of the episodes. Even its darkest of moments feel empty as all it can do has been presented and it has nothing more to say. While the older one was very on the nose on what message it was trying to convey, at least it tried to leave something thoughtful for the viewers to leave with. There\u2019s also a pacing issue that happens in one episode mostly due to the fact that the older version lasted on that country for 2 episodes. Even in the older version it was one of the lower point in the series, but compared to this it changed my perspective on how well done it was in the older version. \\n\\n\r\nNow these two come off more as nitpicks about thing i personally didn\u2019t like which may not have bothered others. The first being that some of the episodes are wasted on other characters rather than on kino. I get that the show wants to focus on other characters that kino have meet on their travels, but this is called \u201cKino\u2019s Journey\u201d not \u201cKino and and other\u2019s Journey. It\u2019s not detrimental to the series, but i would rather the show just focus on Kino and only Kino. secondly is structure which is odd since it being episodic means it doesn\u2019t really have a structure, but this is mostly focused on two certain episodes. The episode that is about kino\u2019s origins, and the episode that sort of serves as a mirror between her and another character in that episode. It\u2019s the problem that it tried to do the same, but also being different at the same time that the episodes lack the sort of emotional impact that the older version had.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to come down as not liking the show. I still thought it was an enjoyable experience during the moment. It still had many aspects that made kino fun to watch even if not all of it was fully actualized",

            "content": "\u201cSometimes having a remake of a well-known series isn\u2019t a good idea at all because it can potentially damage a franchise for good\u201d -Me 2017\r\nThe Orginal Kino's Journey or as I like to call it OG Kino is an endless classic that many anime fans love. It had great worldbuilding, amazing themes, and messages; the episodic episodes were well told and well written that had a point. The characters despite being episodic were all memorable and likable due to them being well written. The visuals while being basic had great direction and cinematography and music while not having many tracks was still great. Plus boththe sub and the dub were very good.\\n\r\nWhile I was watching OG Kino I decided to watch the new Kino alongside with OG Kino weekly. After watching the last episode of New Kino as well watching the last episode of OG a day prior to watching the last episode of New Kino and am going to say this right now.\\n\\n\r\nNew Kino or as I like to call it Lerche Kino completely misses the point of the original series in every way possible as well completely disrespects fans of the original series.\\n\r\nAfter watching OG I was satisfied with what I watched, however, Lerche Kino makes me facepalm because Lerche Kino took everything that was great from the OG Kino and manages to fuck it all up to a point where I can say is THIS IS NOT MY KINO.\\n\r\nWith all that said Hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcomes to my review of Kino' Journey 2017 (Lerche Kino) and with that all that said let's us begin.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Lerche Kino is the same as the original Kino. It follows a young girl called Kino and her talking motorcycle Hermes and they travel to many different countries and forests, each unique in its customs and people. She only spends three days and two nights in every town, without exception, on the principle that three days is enough time to learn almost everything important about a place while leaving time to explore new lands.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Lerche Kino is a mess. A very boring, uninspiring and poorly directed mess.\\n\r\nTo get things started the show doesn\u2019t have much atmosphere. I know am talking about the visuals this early but this is the problem that Lerche kino and it hardly goes away. Because Lerche has almost no atmosphere most of the worlds that Lerche Kino goes to arc bland compared to the original. You see every Country in OG has a different and unique atmosphere that showcases the tone of each country as well as the theme. Lerche Kino hardly does this because each world that Lerche Kino shows are either watered down versions of OG Kino or they are just uninspiring new Country\u2019s that OG Kino did not showcase.\\n\r\nOne of the examples of Lerche Kino being uninspiring is in episode 1 A Country Where People Can Kill Others. That episode alone completely sets the wrong tone of the series which I will explain soon after a compare the first episode of OG Kino. The first episode of OG Kino which is called Land of Visible Pain where Kino visits a town where people with incredibly advanced technology, however, it appears that everyone is living in total isolation and shuns any contact of other people. Once Kino finally started to have a conversation with one the town residents he reveals the advanced technology of the town allowed them to modify their bodies so they can understand each other thoughts allowing for much easier communication. Ofbersly this idea eventually turned sour because it meant that people could no longer hide thoughts on each other and so the nonstop communication eventually drove everyone in the town into isolation. The main themes that were explored in that episode were human modifying, isolation and the consequences of relying on advanced technology. OG Kino did a great job with the first episode and its easily one of the best first episode I have ever seen in an anime.\\n\r\nLerche Kino Episode 1 A Country Where People Can Kill Others is a perfect example of how to not do the first episode. Kino travels to a country where murder is legal and the reason why she even wants to travel to that country is that she want's to kill someone just for her own satisfaction that she killed someone. She want's to kill someone not because she has a grudge against someone or anything like that but she wants to kill someone just for her own satisfaction. Do you see how this series completely misses the point? Not only that the episode itself doesn't really change the nature of the murder of that town not to mention there's barely any theme exploration as well having characters that you can sympathize with in that town.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me started with the Colosseum arc in episode 2 because that arc was atrocious. Not only the themes were butchered to hell but the pacing, writings, character interactions/development and production values were abysmal.  It felt like a badly made shounen series.\\n\r\nAnother problem with Lerche is pacing and worldbuilding. The pacing in Lerche Kino is honestly pretty damn bad. Most episodes just drag on to the point where you just get bored and let\u2019s be real unlike OG Kino most of the events of Lerche are not that interesting in a slightest due to the show butchering its themes and messages for no reason other than appeal to the lowest common denominator of anime fans who like watching crappy light novel adaptations from A1 Pictures. As for worldbuilding, it\u2019s very lackluster and almost none existent. Every Country in OG had a lot of detail put into it while most of the Country in Lerche Kino feels empty and lifeless.\\n\r\nHowever, I give Lerche Kino this.\\n\r\nAs much I dislike Lerche Kino colosseum arc Lerche Kino did a good job with the Kino back-story arc and it was the only arc that I can consider to be good in Lerche Kino,\\n\r\nOverall the story of Lerche Kino is terrible. It has poor pacing, butchered arcs, no atmosphere, barely any themes exploration.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show literally falls apart.\\n\r\nWhy because the characters in Lerche Kino are a complete bastardization to the OG counterparts.\\n\r\nSeriously it\u2019s like director Tomohisa Taguchi didn\u2019t even watch the original series while directing Lerche Kino.\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with Kino herself. What did Tomohisa Taguchi do to you? The original Kino is a transient being and her personality was kept to a minimum. What makes the original Kino so great are her unpredictable reactions.\\n\r\nLerche Kino has too much personality and she often portrayed as a little brat. What makes it worse he is her reactions which are almost predictable and this alone completely defeats the entire point of her character. Overall Lerche Kino is shit.\\n\r\nAs for the rest of characters. They are all bland and uninteresting which is honestly a shame because characters like Shizu and Shishou were interesting in the original while in the new one they are bland and uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters in Lerche are a big failure.\\n\\n\r\n2/10 \\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe original Kino wasn\u2019t the best-looking anime in the world is as it sticks to the old washed out color pallet for every episode but what the original Kino had over Lerche Kino is constantly as well having great cinematography.\\n\\n\r\nWhy am I bringing this up? Because the visuals in Lerche Kino is shit.\\n\r\nTerrible lighting, subpar character designs that are inconstant and constantly go off model, awful background design that doesn\u2019t fit with characters that are in it. What makes this worse is the camera shots and overall direction. For example Episode 1 we have a close shot of Kino traveling while the backgrounds are just burred out and overall less detailed. Also unlike the original Hermes is completely done in CGI and it was horrible. Poor Hermes you DESERVED better than this.\\n\r\nAs for the animation itself, it\u2019s pretty okay overall.\\n\r\nThe main reason why I really dislike the visuals of Lerche Kino\u2019s because not only it abandons the charm and consistently from the original but it actually butchered a lot of messages thanks to this shows shitty visual direction and poor camerawork.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the visuals of Lerche Kino are shit and it completely missed the point of the original Kino.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in Lerche Kino is bland and very forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are pretty decent overall and they fit into the series quite decently.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sub vs dub. They are both pretty good overall so I have no complaints.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nSo that was Lerche Kino. A bad remake that has terrible production values, shitty writing, butchered themes, lackluster characters and awful pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThis is honestly one of the worst anime remakes I have ever seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt completely misses the point of the original Kino series and it has no charm on its own at all.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one no contest one of the worst animes from 2017.\\n\\n\r\nYou better off watching the original Kino and completely skipping Lerche Kino.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 3/10",

            "content": "Kino's Journey: the Beautiful World, shortened to Kino's Journey, is a Japanese light novel series written by Keiichi Sigsawa, with illustrations by Kouhaku Kuroboshi, which is still being published. A 13-episode anime adaptation was produced by A.C.G.T and Genco aired between April and July 2003. Two manga adaptations were produced, and a new anime series aired 12 episodes between October and December 2017. As of 2017, around 8.2 million copies of the novels have been sold in Japan. Newtype USA (a monthly magazine publication originating from Japan, covering anime and manga) named Kino's Journey the Book of the Month for November 2006 and called it\"inviting and addictive,\" while AnimeOnDVD said it \"sucks you in,\" and \"allows you to experience the journey\" together with the main character of the series, Kino. The series has a huge fan base, including the fact that the series is usually mentioned in Takarajimasha's light novel guide book Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi!.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, you do not have to watch the original series to understand the new remake. It is still highly recommendable to watch the 2003 version after finishing the newer one. However, do not think that the original is much better than the remake. What I am trying to say is that if you do not like the remake, there is no need for you to watch the original series. Anyways, for those who do not know anything about that title, I will say it one more time, you do not have to watch the original series first; however, if you are a fan of old animation, you can watch the original first and after it watch the remake. It addition to this, if you think that you can call yourself a fan, consider reading the novel, too.  By the way, I would also like to mention the fact that I am going to refer to the main protagonist of the series (Kino) as they. While their gender is not a major spoiler, but there is a story about it, and I do not want to spoil it; it is for you to find out. \\n\\n\r\nKino\u2019s Journey tells us a story of Kino, who is on a never-ending journey. Their journey started in 2000 and now there are 20 volumes that describe the beauty of Kino\u2019s journeys. Kino, together with their motorcycle, travel to different places and countries that have their own customs and laws. As a general rule, Kino only stays in each place for 3 days. During these three days the story will show you the most beautiful places you have ever seen in your life, or perhaps even the cruelest country you have ever seen. There is always a philosophical dilemma that Kino has to solve and these dilemmas sometimes involve some serious decisions that might put Kino\u2019s life on the line. \\n\\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that the series used to be very popular in 2000; it still has quite a remarkable fan base. Just like me, you might have seen the original in 2003, or even started reading the novel in 2000. In that case, you already know the whole beauty of this series. If not, Kino\u2019s Journey is definitely a huge pearl for those who like slice of life. However, if you believe that this genre is too boring, but still want to watch the series, I would highly recommend you to watch only two episodes a day, otherwise you might find it boring. I also want to concentrate your attention on the fact that Kino\u2019s Journey is not your usual slice of life; you will find philosophy, many life dilemmas, some really tragic scenes, and even some action scenes. Granted, if you are patient, this diamond will reward you with its reach story-line. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound wise, the new remake has a new voice actor cast for both Kino and Hermes, and it is quite a challenge to say if they are better than the previous one. They did their work quite well. As for the opening and ending themes, as well as for the OST, I am sure that the original series did a better job with them. But I would not say that it might be a big problem for you. Art wise, on one hand, the original has a darker feeling to it with its animation, on the other, the remake has a superb new animation, which also does its job the way it should: character designs, background; they all are stunningly beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nAs it has already been stated before, there are two protagonists in this series. Kino is the first main protagonist in the series. They travels to different countries with their talking motorcycle Hermes, which is the second main protagonist, discovering different cultures, customs and people. I am sure that it was one hell of a task for the new voice actors to voice their characters, but they managed to do it. The remake has not lost its best part--characters. The duo is able to keep you interested in what will happen next, providing you with the necessary character development. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to know my opinion, an opinion of a hardcore Kino\u2019s fan, the remake deserves its name. I will not try to hide the fact that I am really disappointed that the old voice actors did not take part in the remake, but the new cast still did one hell of a job. Kino\u2019s Journey (2017)  is still the anime that I watched long time ago. \\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: a very weak 10/10. \\n\r\nAll in all, Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World (2017) is a show that I would recommend to: a) all Kino\u2019s fans, b) all fans of the SoL genre. However, if you are not a fan of the genre, as it has already been mentioned in my review, you should either watch this anime little by little, or you should just avoid it. Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World (2017) is, indeed, a worthy remake. I hope that you will enjoy your journey with Kino and Hermes!",

            "content": "\u201cYou stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox and now, you\u2019re selling it...\u201d -(I really hate that man)\r\nKino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - The Animated Series, or, Kino\u2019s Journey: The Beautiful World - The Animated Series as the gringos say (they don\u2019t), is nothing short of one of the most disappointing experiences I\u2019ve ever had to slog through, and I\u2019ve graduated college. This contemporary adaptation of the light novels of the same name written by Keiichi Sigsawaand illustrated by Kouhaku Kuroboshi also serves as a hard reboot/remake of the previous anime. If you couldn\u2019t extrapolate already from my derisive tone, I admire the original adaptation immensely. \\n\\n\r\nRemake and reboot culture has been running rampant in Hollywood for a decade now and apparently, its vile stench has begun to reach across the pond. Usually, when it comes to remakes or reboots of any kind, the popular attitude when approaching them is one of \u201ccautious optimism\u201d. I\u2019d like to say that my attitude when it came to the announcement of this streamlined version of Kino\u2019s was along those lines despite controversies surrounding the production staff and studio. I generally take gossip like that with a grain of salt, especially with a framework like Kino\u2019s which in theory should be royally difficult to botch. Vitriol aside, the primary objective of any adaptation should be to stand alone from its source material, whether it\u2019s a panel for panel or word for word reimagining. Taking the light novels and original adaptation out of the equation does nothing to aid this clumsy and uneven series, one that will likely be buried worse than its hidden gem of a big sister. \\n\\n\r\nTime for the technicals. One of the biggest points of contention, when it came to this series, was its less than stellar production staff. I have time and time again been proven wrong by certain studios and animators but sadly I can\u2019t vouch for this go at Kino\u2019s Journey. If I could summate my thoughts on the art and animation into a single word, it would probably be \u201csafe\u201d. Nothing about the animation or art direction wowed me, nor do I really care all that much if it did (Kino\u2019s 03 wasn\u2019t exactly adored for its production qualities). The character models were polished, but entirely standard issue. On the topic of character models, Kino\u2019s model was misguidedly off the mark. When Kino is made to look like a scrapped design off the cutting-room floor of a KyoAni drawing session, it entirely ruins one of the most vital aspects of her character (more on that later). There was nothing egregiously awful about the animation, aside from a few cut-corners with reused CG shots of Kino and Hermes. With the simplistic character models, I don\u2019t imagine it was terribly difficult to animate and polish this series as much as they did. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was entirely unassuming so I\u2019m not going to bother expanding my thoughts on it. Most newer anime are more concerned with how polished the aesthetics are, the soundtrack is usually secondary or tertiary. The opening and ending were skippable and most episodes didn\u2019t even have time to fit them in. Aoi Yuuki\u2019s performance as Kino was serviceable at best and derivative at its absolute lowest. I enjoy Yuuki\u2019s roles however it didn\u2019t sound like she was attempting to differentiate this one from any of her other characters. I contend that Mariya Ise or even Miyuki Sawashiro would\u2019ve been better fits for this role. For you dub purists out there, it\u2019s safe to say that this dub is perfectly passable (no funny business with the scripts as far as I could tell...screw you Funimation), but it\u2019s nowhere near as good as the OG\u2019s very underrated dub.  \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not entirely informed on the process involved in cherry-picking the storylines to adapt from the light novels, however from my understanding, these storylines were voted on in some kind of popularity poll. If that\u2019s true, then that just goes to show how much of a disconnect there is between producers and fans who have no idea how the \u201csausage is made.\u201d The dozen or so storylines leave this adaptation feeling episodically inconsistent. Varying greatly in tone, scope, conflict, and characters, this adaptation feels as if it was only ever really interested in exploring the more shallow/surface level thematic elements in the individual countries. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of squandered potential in these episodes, to say the least. For example, there was one particular episode that presented a pretty interesting moral quandary with a country that was constantly moving but in the process would trample and ruin other countries...however, most of the meatier content and thematic undertones are glossed over and played for comedy, shallow action, and a predictable/boring conflict. Despite the original adaptation\u2019s similar approach of varied storylines, it at least provided a consistent utopian throughline that made each episode weave perfectly to create a consistent product. Tonally, this anime feels like a Jackson Pollock with shades of other shows thrown on a canvas that once resembled Kino\u2019s Journey. Except I\u2019d probably have more fun staring down a Jackson Pollock for 4 hours as opposed to wasting another 4 or so hours watching this show. Kino\u2019s is often considered slow and thinky, which on its own isn\u2019t necessarily a valid criticism as much as it is a matter of taste. Kino\u2019s (2017) wasn\u2019t slow or thinky in its execution as much as it was dull and uninteresting which is one of the biggest crimes for a self-contained episodic series. \\n\\n\r\nTo an extent, I agree with the sentiment that Kino serves as more of a neutral framing device to the actual star of the show, the titular journey itself. She is androgynous because her gender doesn\u2019t matter (see my grievance with her character model), her age is vague, and her backstory is seldom explored because it has little importance to where she is now. However, there is one problem with this adaptation\u2019s interpretation of Kino...SHE IS HARDLY THERE TO EVEN BE A FRAMING DEVICE. Sigsawa\u2019s minimalist approach to Kino\u2019s characterization is deliberate, she is our wish fulfillment and wanderlust incarnate, our eyes for this exploration into the deceptively darker side of humanity. Taking the character model out of the equation, they only really got HALF of her character right. Kino was not there to be the eyes for the audience, and when she was there she only half-assed her role. It\u2019s like when Brando showed up to Apocalypse Now overweight and needing his lines fed. Kino aside, there are no compelling or noteworthy characters to speak of. Shizu, Tii, and Riku are hardly worth mentioning were it not worth noting that they are relegated to secondary protagonists in \u201cKino\u2019s Journey\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the best episodes of your reboot/remake are the ones that were practically shot for shot reskins of their original counterpart, there\u2019s a problem. Kino\u2019s Journey is a source material rife with content that would\u2019ve made for excellent food for thought had it been in better hands. Some of that content was explored in this anime but ultimately handled with little care, making for a half-baked soulless product. Utterly devoid of any nuance or didactic philosophical charm that the original provided in spades, Kino\u2019s (2017) was a sorry attempt at streamlining the source. The only subtlety to be found in Kino\u2019s (2017) is its subtle crawl towards commercial territory. Sadly, some of the episodes are mostly above average in quality when compared to a typical gimmick ridden, thrown together, edge-biting seasonal. Despite that grading curve, I cannot award this show more than its individual merits will allow. I love Kino\u2019s but this just wasn\u2019t up to the expectations that were previously set.  \\n",

            "content": "So all the reviews (at the time) haven't seen the original Kino's journey, I haven't either until yesterday and I can completely say if you like the 2017 version and can tolerate a bit of old animation, the 2003 adaptation is worth the watch.\r\nIn this review I want to compare the two, hoping to better describe the show.\r\nStory\r\nBoth versions are episodic, revolving around Kino, the most bad-ass flat chested girl I ever seen and her motorcycle. Each episode is suppose to be thought provoking with \"what if's\" and highlight the faults of humans. There's lot a lot of action and the pacing can feel abit slow at times, but the shocking stories make up for it at the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art is nicely made for the show making the world feel vast and both beautiful despite the chaos around it. The animation is well done as well, although the obvious CGI moments can throw someone off, but we can ignore that right?\\n\r\nCompared to the 2003, the art and animation is obviously going to be worse due to time gap, but dispute that it excels far better in a composition of a shot; making every frame count with little details.\\n\r\nBoth are great at setting up the atmosphere and the tone of every episode, although the new version does a lot of telling than showing while the old version creates a more human feel without unnecessarily making Kino a talk bot.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n2017 version excels in almost every way in terms of music and background noises, although personal preference, I enjoy the 2003 Opening better\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nKino's new design is completely gorgeous and well fitting as she's portrayed slightly more sarcastic and cold hearted in the new version, many of the supported characters are well done as well giving off their personalities at a moment's glance. Due to this show being heavily human based, most of the emotional scenes are human interacts, but because of the heavier tell and less shoe aspects of the newer version each episode doesn't have enough time to flesh out each character or define a real motive other than \"just because.\" Thankfully, this doesn't hinder the story too much as well can still experience every situation thrown at Kino with surprise.\\n\r\nOther the other hand, I believe the 2003 version does a better job fleshing out it's characters, although Kino's personality is a bit stale the vibrant cast of side characters are more than enough to balance it all out, highlighting their personalities and motives without needing to say what their personalities are. Kino, although still being a bit cold, is shown to have a better understanding and passion towards the world making it heartwarming when things turn out alright at he end.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, both are great shows and the ideals questioned will never be outdated. Both have aspects that make them standout despite having similar atmospheres and it seems like where one version falls the other excels.",

Constant CG usage, may bother some people\r\n3. No character development \r\n\r\nBefore Fall 2017 even started, I was very hyped for this series. If you don't know, I love anime with interesting world for me to explore. That's why I adore Made in Abyss last season. Well, after hearing a lotof complaints from fans of the 2003 series, is this show still worth watching? I don't know if my opinion can help but imo this series is definitely worth my time. \\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about Kino's Journey is the world. Of course for a series about our main character traveling from place to place, if the world isn't interesting, then this will be a stinky pile of garbage. However, Kino's Journey really did pack in a beautiful world for me to explore. I enjoyed myself learning about each countries Kino traveled to. Each of them are very unique and interesting. I'd say if you love world building in anime then be sure to check this out. No, YOU MUST CHECK THIS OUT.\\n\\n\r\nThe 2nd part I like about Kino's Journey is it's art and animation. The scenery for each country was beautifully drawn and that's enough for me. If an anime about traveling can't draw the scenery correctly, the it fails hard. Fortunately, Kino's Journey packed in quite an eye-catching scenery for me to look at and to love. The animation, although there are an awful ton of CG usage in some episodes, but as I'd say before, I don't hate CG. The CG in this series is natural, I guess. It didn't bother me that much but I'd say the art itself covered up the shit CG. I can forgive the animation because of the beautifully drawn art.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I love the OP and ED theme for this series. It's sung by Yanagi Nagi, who if you haven't heard before, sang the OP for SNAFU and Just Because. I really love her voice. It's soothing and calming. The background music, also didn't stand out much, was still well-placed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, I like Kino. But other characters I don't really care much about. Although they did show us the backstories of other travelers, but in the end I watched this series for the world building and it already satisfied me, so even if the characters didn't stand out much to me, I still won't hate this series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed myself watching Kino's Journey 2017. It's a refreshing watch and for a person who likes world building like me, this series is perfect. Now, if you excuse me, I'll head over to the 2003 version. 8/10 That's it for my review. Thanks for reading. :)",

            "content": "Let me keep this short but direct to my opinion, as I understand the pain of reading a long review, diluted with nonsense. \r\nKino's journey depicts the philosophical issue of Cultural relativism extremely well. Without wishing to commit the misdemeanour of spoiling the story, Kino's journey may be summarised as simply as Kino and his motor bike Hermes, which can speak, travelling around different countries and visiting there for a maximum of three days.\r\nKino is often very fair in assessing each country he visits, and whilst he does hold his personal preference towards one over the other, this may be at its subtlest and reflectsthe cultural relativist's idea that no single culture is morally significant to the other. The strong contrast between characters native to their country narrates the discernible lack of objectivity, nor the common nature between them. For aspiring philosophers, like yourself, this is a highly recommendable series to indulge in; alas, apart from the visual portrayal of cultural relativism the series perhaps lacks in enthusiasm, or a dynamic coherence between each episode compared to other series such as Code Geass.\\n\r\nNevertheless, such criticism may not truly reflect the weaker side of this series, as one may be dubious in comparing Kino's journey to Code Geass, and the watchers aren't necessarily expecting a plot-twisting anime with cleverly fabricated foreshadowing, but a more contemplative time to enrich his day.\\n\r\nI must admit I haven't watched this series for over a year, so maybe I'm not covering a pivotal aspect of it, which other reviews may have adressed. Hopefully, my point has been delivered across to the reader enough to encourage a quick peak of the first episode. My personal highlight was episode 10; for the more time-restrained watchers, perhaps starting with episode 10 isn't the worst point of entry, as most episodes don't necessarily follow or introduce each other anyways.\\n\r\nApology goes to the long read, for those tolerant enough for the full review. I understand the hypocrisy of opening the review claiming brevity and clarity, and end up writing the non sense I feared I was going to do so, but in hindsight nothing has been regretted.",

            "content": "Kino no Tabi is almost more like reading a philosophy essay on human nature than watching an anime. However, the way in which the characters and story are woven into the exploration of various different \"types\" of human nature makes it enjoyable as both an anime and from a philosophical standpoint. Kino no Tabi develops the elements of anime that are most important to its themes to their fullest, but still manages to develop the other elements to an incredible degree.\r\nNext, a small breakdown of the individual elements:\r\nStory - Overall, this was one of the weaker elements. However, I still found it interesting, especially becauseof its unconventional nature. Everything tied together very well, and each of the subplots (most of them based in one particular episode) were resolved to a satisfactory degree.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art was incredibly well done. The beauty of it really helps to convey the world that Kino lives in, and helps to convey the story. My only issue was with a few of the 3D scenes, as some (not all) broke the flow of the animation for a moment. Most of the 3D scenes worked well enough, however.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The exploration of character is what gives this anime its unique, philosophic viewpoint. Therefore, character is very well done. The development of character, as well as the revelation of different parts of character, makes each episode unique and enjoyable. This includes not only the major characters, but also many of the minor and side characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World has been one of the most enjoyable anime that I've seen recently. The philosophic standpoint, combined with interesting worldbuilding and incredible art, makes for an interesting and pleasant experience.",

            "content": "Have you ever wondered what Kino's Journey would be like if it were garbage?\r\nWell, look no further friend!\r\nI shouldn't have to spell this out, but this is a review that draws heavily on comparing the two Kino anime. It is not an objective view of the 2017 anime alone. I would have found it boring and shitty regardless of the 2003 show's context, but then this review would lack the indignation of seeing everyone's favorite anime indie art film reduced to a cheap and casual throwaway series.\r\nAre you new to Kino's Journey? Well lucky for you the whole original series is available on a numberof streaming services for free and there's no need for you to waste your time here.\\n\\n\r\nMemorize the phrase \"boring and shitty\", because that can be used to describe most of this tonally devoid, shallow, toothless, low IQ series.\\n\\n\r\nTHE PREMISE:\\n\\n\r\nKino's Journey is the tale of a person named Kino who is on a Journey. WOW, right? But it's not a traditional adventure story, it's a much more philosophical one. Every few days Kino stops at a country for exactly three days, takes in the culture, and leaves. Every different country presents a different moral dilemma to consider, and Kino serves as an outsider looking in, generally choosing not to get wrapped up in their affairs, though sometimes it happens. You'll get presented with prompts that make you wonder about the nature of communication, humanity, society, free will, morality, etc and each adventure is a fable with a take-away. Like a demented book of fables, Kino shows us something about our world by exploring the one she lives in.\\n\\n\r\nIf that sounds great, this is not the series for you. Basically this adaptation is about one of the girls from K-On! scooting around shooting people with a psychotically apathetic smile on her face, presented in the most boring ways possible.\\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY:\\n\\n\r\nThe original Kino's Journey introduced us to Kino, the philosophical nature of her Journey, and the shit she has to go through and how she copes with it.\\n\\n\r\nThis adaptation opens with Kino eating cake and then some guy gets murdered, with the moral of the story being \"if everyone owned a gun, society would be peaceful\" and that's about it. Kino then goes to a place and kills a bunch of people for the sake of testing her skills and avenging a character we're never introduced to. She never shows emotion and seems completely disinterested in everything that's happening around her. She has no established rules or moral code and by episode three she's a traveling murderer and not much else can be derived from her time on screen.\\n\\n\r\nTHE ART and ANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nThe original Kino was low-budget for sure, it was indie as hell. But it had incredible direction and cinematography to make up for it. The series original series is moody, tense, eerie and kind of surreal. It sticks out even today as something of visual interest.\\n\\n\r\nThis series looks like Sword Art Online. All the characters look the same. All backgrounds devoid of real detail. All colors are bright and cheery at all times. All camera angles are flat shots of talking heads or just panning shots of nothing. There is no cinematography going on here. Kino's bike is CGI because modern Japanese animators can't fucking draw, but they're also paid $500 a year, so who would want to?\\n\\n\r\nThe opening sequence is a poppy borefest of BIRDS BIRDS BIRDS because Kino said something about birds once. It's like this whole thing is directed by a high school student.\\n\\n\r\nWHAT DOES IT SOUND LIKE?\\n\\n\r\nThe original series' music is pretty cool, with acoustic guitars and panflutes and one damned great OP.\\n\r\nThis series has jpop. It's about as generic as an OST can get. It feels very upbeat at all times, no matter what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nKino here sounds kawaii. Her bike's voice actor sounds like, uh, Mechazawa from Cromartie High? Soothing and male? Originally the bike's voice was grainy and cynical-sounding, adding to the series' eerie atmosphere. In this one, the voice aligns with the series having no atmosphere at all, so I guess it's fitting.\\n\\n\r\nAll side characters sound as over-acted and generic as you could expect anime characters to sound. Kino's Journey has gone from one of the most off-beat Japanese properties to one of the most unimaginative and anemic.\\n\\n\r\nARE YOU JUST MAD THAT IT'S DIFFERENT?\\n\\n\r\nNo, I'm mad because it's shit.\\n\r\n2003 Fullmetal and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood are different series. They're both good and do different things with their different tones. One is a drama, the other is action shounen.\\n\\n\r\nB-BUT THIS ONE IS MORE FAITHFUL TO THE SOURCE THAN THE ORIGINAL ANIME\\n\\n\r\nI hate to break this to you bud, but the Kino novels are probably mostly crap, written by a hack, and the original anime's directors, writers and artists are what made the show memorable. I love Nightow, but no one wants a faithful Gungrave adaptation. It's the same situation here. The author supplied a cool character and premise, and people with more talent than he made Kino a franchise worth remembering. That's that.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has no tone. It's just bad and effortless. It's a lifeless application of \"How to Make a Marketable Anime in 2017 in 5 Easy Steps\" except they fucked it up because they applied it to Kino's Journey and not fantasy light novel #8473.\\n\\n\r\nThere's really nothing redeeming here.\\n\\n\r\nGo watch the original.\\n\\n\r\nUnless you're just into anime because you want something that looks the same as everything else you watch and have no interest in thinking or feeling any mild discomfort at all. Then yeah, watch this. I hate you though.",

            "content": "It surprised me to see that many of the preliminary reviews were written by users who had not watched the original 2003 adaptation of Kino's Journey. While I believe it is admirable to judge the 2017 adaptation with fresh eyes and a clean slate, I also believe there is merit in comparing the reboot to its predecessor. As a disclaimer, I have not read the LN.\r\nPerhaps the difference between the two adaptations is best determined through their focus. The 2003 Kino no Tabi places greater emphasis on the world and the journey through its writing, episode sequence, and themes. The 2017 Kino no Tabi tendsto stress its characters over its world, though the 2003 version arguably accomplished this better as well in certain episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this year's adaptation if you are interested in watching a series that is not entirely sad, or entirely happy, but something that tries to display human hubris while keeping the spotlight on a cute, plot-armored girl. If you prefer something with more substance, greater focus on the world, equal prominence of the main character, and don't mind cruder presentation, then the 2003 original would be more gratifying.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally regarded to be more thought-provoking or morally ambiguous, the original anime owes its reputation partly to its director, Nakamura Ryutaro, who oversaw Serial Experiments Lain. This is not to say it lacked levity or lightheartedness, but the show very much exemplified one of Kino's mantras--The world is not beautiful; and that, in a way, lends it a sort of beauty.\\n\\n\r\nThe 2003 anime had moments of cruelty, of inevitability, of the human desire to change things for the better and of the tendency for those consequences to end poorly. It was also hopeful, touching, and a celebration of life. I want to make clear that the 2017 anime still retains most of these aspects. But the one thing that sets them apart is that Nakamura's version was far more subtle. There is little reading between the lines in the 2017 show, as characters do not hesitate to provide exposition or explain their motivations. It is hard to imagine the winter or library episodes existing in the current adaptation. Another major difference is the consideration given to Kino's backstory. The 2003 anime preferred to get it out of the way much earlier than the 2017 one, which pivoted our attention back to the world sooner. The newer adaptation keeps her origins hidden longer, as one might expect if the focus and suspense is on the main character.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, comparing the new and old series is like comparing day and night. The art of the 2017 version is fantastic. The lines are sharp, the colors pleasant. Kino's design more closely resembles her appearance on the LN covers. In contrast, the 2003 version was rough even for its time: the designs were cruder, simpler; Kino looked more aloof, easygoing, sarcastic, and shrewd at the same time; she also appeared more androgynous, lacking moe or particularly feminine qualities. There were times when this was a detriment, such as viewing palatability and reduction of stakes (it is far harder to lament the loss of a bland, ugly world than a colorful, detailed one). And yet the cruder artstyle of Nakamura's storyboards allowed greater appreciation of the nonvisual content of the show--the tracks, the story being told, the atmosphere. Sometimes what is less beautiful on the outside may surprise you on the inside.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of the 2017 reboot lends credence to its slice-of-life description. Overall the tunes are more happy-go-lucky than the original, but this is not a bad thing. I find the OPs and EDs to fit their respective shows, though preference will depend on the viewer. The VAs were perfectly cast.\\n\\n\r\nFor better or for worse, Kino is more expressive this time around. It's easy to say this is a demerit, that it draws attention away from the \"beautiful world,\" but it doesn't. It goes without saying that it is not necessarily wrong to give greater focus to Kino, for we accompany her journey through her eyes and her actions. Hermes remains mostly the same. The greatest departure the 2017 version makes, however, is the dedication of multiple episodes to characters other than Kino and Hermes. This decision allows viewers to see Kino's world from a different pair of eyes, and I found it a highly enjoyable break from the expected format. The biggest drawback is that these episodes take time away from Kino and her mostly non-meddling policy and the series would have been stronger for it if a second cour were planned.\\n\\n\r\nKino's Journey (2017) could be considered iyashikei. It is more casual, relaxing, humorous, and pleasant to watch, with a hint of thoughtfulness thanks to the source material. Kino's Journey (2003) could be called iyashikei, for different reasons. It is easy to call the new one an inferior remake, but overall it is neither worse than nor a reimagining of its predecessor. Some of its episodes are remakes, yes, but they have improvements as well as detractions. Parallels between both versions may be gleaned in a couple more. The rest are simply new stories presented from an angle that is perhaps more agreeable to the modern demographic.\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not the newest Kino no Tabi is weaker than the original depends on what you expect or desire. But for most people looking for a pleasant show to spend half a day on, I think Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - The Animated Series is worth their time.",

            "content": "Keichii Sigsawa's 'Kino no Tabi (Kino's Journey) The Beautiful World' is one of the longest running ongoing Light Novel series in existence, generally releasing a whole volume of material every year since 2000. In that time it has received first an Anime adaptation in 2003 directed by the late Ryutaro Nakemura, and this 2017 adaptation by Studio Lerche. For fairness, I will not try to compare this version to its source material or the previous adaptation too much and try to judge it based on its own merit.\r\nThe premise of the series is that it follows the Journey of a traveller named Kino and theirtalking Motorrad Hermes through their travels across a world made up of small countries which each encompass their own unique ideologies, cultures, and traditions. From this, Sigsawa uses the perspective of Kino, a traveller with no ties to a particular culture of their own and a maintained neutral outlook on the morally grey activities which they often come across, to look at multiple  facets of philosophy and the human condition. This results in a very interesting and thought provoking episodic series, whatever its incarnation.\\n\r\nWhile this will be a positive review overall, as I did find more to enjoy about this adaptation than I didn't, I will start this review off discussing the negatives of the series first, as they are perhaps the more glaring issue with this adaptation, and the one which may turn potential viewers (be they familiar with the source material or not) off.\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the adaptation is without a doubt the stories that were adapted for this versions. For those of you who didn't know, the stories from the LN selected for this adaptation were picked from a poll in which fans of the LN were asked to vote for their favourite stories from the series. While this may sound like a good idea on paper, as it means we get to see what the fans themselves picked as the highlights, sort of like making the series a Band's Greatest Hits compilation which can in turn help to entice new viewers, the issue comes about when the stories placed near each other cause the series to feel extremely uneven.\\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is that in the original source material, these stories would have been written in the order they were for a reason. That becomes apparent when we see how tonally conflicting the series can be, as the episodes can often be radically different in terms of tone so that one week we witness a deep and quite dark study of the way that humans take their lives for granted but then next week get a silly, action packed episode. This often extreme tonal dissonance which occurs between the stories can often feel jarring, and lead to the feeling that the series suffers a severe identity crisis in which it doesn't quite know what it's trying to be as a series.\\n\r\nIt doesn't help also that some of the stories in the series perhaps aren't what I would have selected as being among my favourites. The worst offender perhaps being an episode which is itself a compilation of short stories which each feel insufferably self parodying and painful to watch (this is episode 9 in case I've convinced you to skip this episode when you watch).\\n\r\nAnother major problem with the series is the direction it takes. Lerche are  a studio whose work I'm only familiar with from this year, and from what I can gather, the popular consensus seems to be that they're an extremely uneven studio, and that certainly reflects in this adaptation, which additionally serves as a showcase for both the studio's strengths and weaknesses. They certainly aren't a studio known for subtlety for one thing, and when the series does try to showcase its more philosophical side by showcasing the actions of people within the societies that exist in this world, their emotions and negative reactions to things which dilute their customs can sometimes feel a bit overblown, not helping is some really overacting VA work for those characters. This can unfortunately cause the side characters to feel a bit like caricatures, and the way such scenes are so sporadically directed to have some sort of dynamic breakdown suddenly occur can often lead to it looking a tad more silly than it was possibly intended.\\n\r\nAdditionally, the studio's trademark heavily saturated lighting can sometimes cause the colour pallet to feel overblown and processed, and this becomes an issue when it subtracts from any atmosphere the story in question is trying to convey, and for those with more sensitive eyes can perhaps look a bit ugly when it is done wrong. That said, this lighting effect when done right can actually help to enhance the atmosphere in some episodes, and make some genuinely lovely background art which brings the world of the series to life, looking appropriately Beautiful as the title implies.\\n\r\nNow, with these admittedly very large issues of inconsistent story quality and sometimes harmful directorial choices, I will say that the series is actually good overall, when it manages to overcome these issues.  More specifically, when the strength of the source material is able to shine through in the stronger episodes. For me, these would include episodes 1, 4, 5, 6 & 10.  Each of these episodes appeal to the main strength of the series, a frank look at philosophy and the human condition, sometimes told through a surprisingly dark and chilling lens which invites the viewer to reflect and think about the morality of what just transpired.\\n\r\nOn the side of characters, Kino and Hermes are of course the main characters of the series, travelling across the world with a neutral stance towards the (often terrifying) events they encounter which in turn helps us the audience to view them with a similar lens. Unfortunately, there's pretty much nothing in terms of development for the main character as a slight result of that aforementioned episode order, with the possible exception of episode 10.\\n\r\nAdding fuel to the fire is the addition of episodes which don't feature Kino as the main character, as we also see stories told primarily through the perspectives of other travellers who Kino met on their journey, such as their mentor, and Shizu; the former prince of a dead kingdom who travels with a talking dog, and later a unique child. These characters are likeable enough on their own, and does provide a counterbalance by looking through the different perspectives of characters who lack Kino's neutral ideology and solve situations differently from how they would, but it does become a problem in the second half of the series when their episodes dominate and cause  Kino to feel almost insignificant in their own series.\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, I already discussed the advantages and disadvantages of Lerche's heavily saturated lighting. The animation looks fine for the most part, though it does look fairly safe, there's nothing much unique about it. Some people criticised this change in artistic style from the 2003 adaptation, but this ignores the fact that Sigsawa's own illustrations for the series have changed through the years he has been working on the series. The 2003 version reflected the designs he used at that time, while this version reflects his current artstyle, so it isn't really \"betraying the source material\" as many said.\\n\r\nThe OST isn't particularly grabbing, while some of the side characters do overact a bit, the voice acting is generally fine for the most part, with Aoi Yuuki being typically lovely as the voice of the main character, and Inori Minase providing an appropriate mix of nervousness and calm to her one-off character. The OP and ED are both quite lovely (and evidently where most of the animation resources were allocated above all else) capturing the more calm and tranquil aspects of the series, as well as its serene sense of beauty.\\n\r\nPerhaps the most frustrating conclusion I have come to in this review is that I still don't quite know who I'd recommend this series to. I suppose if you consider yourself a \"Super fan\" of the source material you should at least try it, outside of that it becomes a bit trickier, as I've seen from the community mixed responses to the series, some newcomers feeling unmotivated by it, others enjoying it, and similarly mixed opinions from fans of the 2003 adaptation. I will say that if you're a newcomer, the 2003  adaptation is probably a better bet to go on, as it has a much more consistent tone and represents the strengths of the source material in a much more solid way by ignoring some of the sillier storylines that pop up in this version. And check out this adaptation after that if you feel you can tolerate it.\\n\r\nAs I said before, despite this adaptation's glaring faults, its uneven quality, I still found it to be a fairly faithful adaptation of the source material. Especially in those stronger episodes that I highlighted. And it does reveal many of its cracks, especially in the second half of the series, but for what it was, and for those episodes I liked, I do give it credit.",

            "content": "A Masterpiece anime is rare to find and it's specially rare nowadays since the shows mostly focus on bad harems and shitty romance but sometimes a new season comes out and there is that one anime that is just beautiful and tho they don't come every season but i'm happy to say that this season had two of those, Kino and Net-juu.\r\nKino is an episodic SOL anime with a dark tone which isn't really everyone's cup of tea but it sure as hell is mine, you start with Kino and Hermes (The mottorad) traveling to a new country with every episode being a unique andgreat well-thought out story, you get to see all different kinds of people with different culture and ways of thinking which is the very basis of this anime, i mean it is called Kino no tabi the beautiful journey for a reason, the reason people don't like this is that they try to logic out every thing based on how they feel or how they think but even in real life there are places with a fucked-up way of thinking that they consider normal and the same way around so just deal with what is present to you and you would surely enjoy this much much more.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great from the main cast to all other side characters with each of them being unique with great characteristics and not just repetition or flat characters like in most SOL being produced now.\\n\r\nThe voice actors were great and even though i liked the old voice of kino, the new one still does a phenomenal job of portraying kino's feelings. \\n\r\nThe art is great and that was one of the things i was worried about since almost all anime uses CGI horribly and the art seems inconsistent so i'm happy to say (aside from some parts in episode 12) the art is very consistent and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nWhen they announced a new season i was worried that it was going to turn into some moe-shit anime like most sol anime now so i'm happy to see this remake being as good as the original with it's new added stories.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a hint at a new season at the end which is very nice to see tbh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a solid 10/10.\\n\r\nWould recommend to even Non-anime fans.",

            "content": "Life is a journey and the road ahead is filled with a lot of obstacles that we must overcome to reach our final destination......\r\nFirst of all this is not a sequel for the old Kino it's a remake with some changes for the art style , plot and story which i will mention them in this review.So let's go on a journey then....\r\nThe first 2 episodes despite being bland their purpose is to get the viewer used to the plot, story and characters and captivate your attention with the improved animation and scenery(landscape). After those 2 episodes things get better and some episodes will leavea good impression after finishing this series.The story is simple and relaxing following Kino on his motorrad through his journey from a country to another meeting different people and learning about each country's customs and culture during his 3 days stay. A variety of themes are explored and morals to learn from them at the end of each episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are better explored in this series especially the side characters who get a spotlight in some episodes (the focus is not only on Kino like in the old series) which is a strong point and brings a lot of diversity to the story and plot. The visuals are gorgeous and the scenery is very captivating and this is an essential factor for the main concept of this show.An interesting fact from this show is how they portrayed the bond between motorrads&travelers and presented both of their perspectives about the meaning of a journey. \\n\\n\r\nOne big problem this show has are some episodes who lack substance and don't manage to get the viewer attached to the characters and story.For example they should explored more about the characters backgrounds and how they end up in that situation instead the presentation is rushed and it leaves a dry taste in your mouth after finishing an episode. Although the old Kino did a better job at that the remake has some remarkable episodes that will surely become your favorites.\\n\\n\r\nThe scenery, ost and animation are superior and for those who enjoy those stuff from an anime if the old Kino didn't seem appealing to you this remake will surely captivate you , especially the opening song animation having a rich visual vocabulary and innovative concepts. So my advice is to give it a try and don't binge it you need to take your time with this show and enjoy each minute from it. \\n",

            "content": "\"The world is not beautiful, therefore it is.\"\r\nThis review will be based sorely on the 2017 remake/reimagining of Kino's Journey, while references to the original 2003 will be debatable as well.\r\nTo boot, the original series was a cult classic to people who have watched it, and the reboot by studio Lerche this year made a good transition with the visuals and music, and personally and honestly this is a good watch even if it's action-packed, adventurous SoL.\r\nThis is the story of Kino and her motorrad Hermes, on an episodic journey to showcase the countries they have been to: its characteristics and what makes it standout for the country, even if for the citizens of the respective countries they come from.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I wouldn't go so far as to call the 2017 version a reboot of Kino's Journey, but like as mentioned, a reimagining with sprinkles of the original anime mixed into the substance as well, and I kinda quite liked the direction it took, even if some scenes were hard to understand and swallow.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe simple Kino, her adaptation of the name from a traveler of the same name who got murdered (Episode 11 spoilers) riding along with her motorrad Hermes, both characters take the cake for being the main \"protagonists\" of the show. I say it that kind of way because the show's narration doesn't quite explicitly focus on them all the time, but then it's still fascinating to see how Kino survives with Hermes on the journeys of good and bad and getting a fine taste of what's to come.\\n\\n\r\nAnd also, this time we have another set of people: Shizu and Riku (from Episode 6) whose intention is the same: to travel around and experience life that's a journey. Unfortunately, I feel like their on-screen time could have been given a bit more than just 2 or 3 episodes, even if their plot started out a bit later. Unlike Kino, Shizu is more regressed and too also has a heart of gold, with the dog companion Riku, they both make good progress with their lives too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series doesn't need to overshine the main and supporting characters, but they at least get the job done for showcasing a simple, yet intriguing series that keeps you on your toes.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nAgain, Lerche has done great on the series, albeit that most people prefer the original due to nostalgia. The truth is that while this series has nothing new to offer, it at least got an upgrade to the visuals and music (which I'll discuss later). For a world that's portrayed as \"not being beautiful, therefore it is\", the environment looks lush and beautiful and could not go any further. But with that said, some liberties are taken directly from the original source material, but it's honestly not too bad. Surprisingly enough, I did notice a fair share of lack in quality, but it quickly overshadows that with the immersive story. Another job well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis might be the 1st of a few times where I actually like Yanagi Nagi's music composition with the OP and ED, it sticks out in a very melodious atmosphere, and honestly it could not get any better than this. Her music makes you feel like you're experiencing something totally new and fresh, and that's how I like how she portrays the surrounding and makes the sound of music combine with the visuals to give it a good-sounding edge over the rest of the other shows out there. Overall, high praises for the music and BGM, the reason why it compels me to watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAs mentioned, there's some debate over this and the original to further extent, and I don't blame anyone for it, because we do share our own opinions and have a liking for the ones we love. With that said, Kino's Journey -The Beautiful World- 2017 reimagining is one show from Fall 2017 not to be overlooked, even if the aesthetics do fall apart at times and have people overwhelmed by how it sticks out like a sore thumb to the original. I personally liked the calming atmosphere, and it is truly one of the great shows of the season.",

            "content": "Do not be fooled, this is NOT a sequel to the first season made back in 2003. This season is a remake.\r\nStory: (8/10)\r\nAs of episode six there is not much to the story but it is simple. The main character goes from country to country in what seems to be a post apocalyptic world. The world is very separated and each country she visits seems to harbor something new and unexpected. This story tells of her adventures as she travels with her talking motorbike named Hermes. She meets dangerous and humble strangers and learns new ways of life.\r\nArt: (9/10)\r\nAs the world is \"anything but beautiful\"the animation proves otherwise. I enjoy watching the animation and it is a key reason why I was interested in the series before initially knowing what it was about. It is a \"sight for sore eyes.\" Especially the opening and ending themes, the art style is my favorite.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8/10)\\n\r\nThe music is simply touching and really adds to each moment. I enjoy listening to the music. There are also nature sounds we hear through a lot of scenes which rather just adds the nice touch factor.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (8/10)\\n\r\nSo far there are just two main characters Kino and Hermes. They are really shrouded in mystery along with the world around them. Kino is a very like able character and I enjoy seeing what she has up her sleeve next. She is actually quite bad ass. She may look tiny but she has a big will to fight. I can tell that there is something in her past that inepts her to keep traveling.\\n\\n\r\nHermes is a motorbike, with a personality and a voice?? Yeah, I know, weird. But I like it and I wouldn't want it any other way. Hermes is Kino's companion on her travels. We do not know much about their ways but to me it seems they are inseparable.\\n\\n\r\nWe end up meeting a few characters here and there that Kino becomes acquainted with during her travels. It seems a lot of my questions about them will go unanswered. I enjoy the slight hint of mystery behind these humble strangers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10)\\n\r\nI enjoy watching this series. There is nothing I don't like about it so far. There is subtle humor sprinkled in to each episode that I love. I hope you give this anime a chance. I have hopes my curiosity becomes inspiration as the series develops. It is quite the fascinating world!",

            "content": "Note: I have not watched the original season that came out in 2003. Also minor spoilers.\r\nUpon reading the synopsis for this show after viewing the fourth episode, I discovered two things. Firstly, that Kino is a girl (wowz), and secondly, that anthropomorphism doesn't just extend to slapping on a pair of boobs on anything non-human.\r\nAnyhow, people seem to be praising this show as one of the hidden gems of this season, and after checking out a couple of episodes, it's not hard to see why. The main lead doesn't yell obnoxiously every few seconds, her clothes don't explode after she eats something, and the significantlack of edge in the show is truly refreshing. Does this mean that this show is devoid of flaws, though?\\n\\n\r\nWell, no.\\n\\n\r\n\"\"Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - The Animated Series\" is an episodic show, meaning that each episode is more or less stand-alone and you can watch it in any order you like. What makes this show interesting is that it explores the possible ways countries which have questionable laws - say, allowing theft - function. The studio behind this show, Lerche, has done a pretty decent job on the audiovisuals. The backgrounds are well animated, and the soundtrack reflects the \"beautiful world\" theme nicely. Although, I think that the focus of this show leans more towards the people which inhabit these strange countries rather than the landscapes.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to my main point of criticism. Some of the episodes so far focus heavily on human drama. However, this is only effective if the characters involved in this drama are properly developed and fleshed out. If not, how can you evoke any sort of emotional response from the audience? Usually, this isn't much of a problem for a show, but \"Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - The Animated Series\" just so happens to be episodic. This means that entire, complex backstories are reduced to one or two minutes of continuous exposition, usually done by our friendly neighborhood talking bike(God knows how it found the information in the first place). I'd also like to see some more character development on our two main leads, but since only four episodes have come out, it's not too big of a problem. Yet.\\n\\n\r\nBy the looks of things, this series will end up as a fairly decent one, but not anything outstanding. However, I genuinely enjoyed the episodes which solely involved Kino and Hermes exploring some weird country. If more of the following episodes don't involve any crazy drama, this might end up as one of the best shows of the season.",

            "content": "To say this remake of Kino's Journey is a disappointment would be an understatement. The original 2003 series was a hidden gem of the decade that depicted a series of short stories that were parables focused on elements of the human condition observed through the traveler, Kino. The stories tended to vary in their mood and intensity, being either bizarre, insightful, or having a dark and twisted element to them. In spite of the changing moods, the 2003 Kino's Journey adaptation did a great job with balancing them out with exploring both the joys and pains of being human.\r\nThis remake sadly lacks the subtlety andnuances that made its 2003 counterpart a pleasure to watch. The stories for this remake are more blatant in exploring the moral they are focused on and many of them seemed to lack the time to allow the viewer to be immersed into exploring the various lands visited by Kino, thus reducing the impact of when the true side of the visited country gets revealed. The story order also felt more disjointed as several episodes of this series shifted over to exploring other characters like the swordsman, Shizu, and the slave girl, Photo. While interesting characters in their own right, there's little further elaborated on with Shizu following his introduction and Photo only has a single episode devoted to her. But perhaps the worst element to this adaptation of Kino's Journey is the series often getting too immersed into showing off action when Kino and Shizu get into any sort of major conflict. Said action scenes mostly have nothing to do with exploring the moral of each of its episodic stories beyond showing off the anime's animation and goes against the whole point of Kino's Journey about the series as a whole being moral-focused parables with an occasional cruel twist. Anyone who has seen the 2003 adaptation of Kino will notice the rather jarring difference in story mood, focus, and presentation choices as some episodes for this remake adapt stories also featured in the 2003 anime like the Coliseum arc and the Land of Adults story.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real praise that I can give this remake of Kino's Journey is the improved artwork over the original series. There is greater detail put into character designs and scenic shots are more pleasing on the eyes. Animation is also more fluid for the most part with more natural movement depicted with characters, especially noticeable during the anime's action scenes. In spite of the improved animation though, the use of CG animation still sticks out badly compared to the regular animation and is quite noticeable at points where complicated animated sequences are depicted, particularly whenever Kino is riding on Hermes. Also in terms of a presentation choice for a series like Kino, the more detailed and brightly-colored visuals don't mesh well with a series like Kino that is more focused on exploring the morals each story has to offer up on an element of the human condition.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say Kino's Journey 2017 easily makes for the biggest disappointment I have for an anime series this year. In spite of its improved visuals, it felt like Lerche did not have a clue on what made Kino's Journey an enjoyable series during its 2003 run as there were points where it felt like the series was unsure over what it wanted to focus on and then when making the effort to explore a moral, the focus of it felt forced and lacked the subtlety and impact offered from its original series. If you want a better option at seeing how Kino's Journey could be adapted in animated form, I strongly suggest checking out the 2003 series over this subpar adaptation for it.",

            "content": "I personally like Kino's design and yay! for the \"rare\" female protagonist! But that alone shouldn't be the deciding factor. \r\nJumping straight to the story;\r\nI've watched \"a few\" episodes of the 2003 version and I would say that I prefer the reboot (2017 version). I dropped the 2003 version after a few episodes because I didn't really like how they did the show.\r\nIn the 2003 version, I personal found that the stories were a bit \"too vague\" (with morals neither here nor there...verging more towards negative I would say), not to mention that Kino was acting indifferent even in the face of injustice (not sureabout later episodes of the 2003 version). The 2003 version seems to be pushing this thing about humans being immoral/evil, and \"that's just how humans are and we should let them be\"...which I'm strongly against. Well, I guess that's to be expected from the theme of the show which is \"The world is not beautiful, therefore it is.\"\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure about others, but I find that Kino and Hermes in the 2003 version quite annoying as most of their dialogues seemed pretty empty and at some points had questionable morals and reasoning...\\n\\n\r\nPros of the 2017 version as a standalone:\\n\r\n- Kino having more depth as a moralistic person. I like how in this version it clearly shows what Kino is okay with and what she's not okay with. Thankfully, so far (up to ep 5) there hasn't been any questionable reasoning by Kino.\\n\\n\r\n- Hermes says questionable things once in awhile but I'm glad that the show made it clear that its just Hermes's point of view as a motorrad / machine. \\n\\n\r\n- I like how this show highlights humans being evil and that oftentimes criminals/evil people should be gotten rid-of to maintain peace.\\n\\n\r\nCons of the 2017 version as a standalone:\\n\r\n- Kino seems somewhat overpowered at times compared to the average civilian but then again there are some other characters in the show which are somewhat overpowered as well...so I guess I could just brush it off as something that just goes on in Kino's universe, as in if you're skilled, you're going to be somewhat super skilled at times.. Thankfully most of the time it's done somewhat realistically.\\n\\n\r\n- Some episodes feel empty. As in it works as a story but doesn't have much meaning behind it.\\n\\n\r\n- There are some logic holes here and there. Thankfully not much.\\n\\n\r\n- Oddly enough, Kino's sex seems to be a \"thing\" in this reboot. I'm not sure why as it just seems off... Well I guess that's to be expected when most people seem to be really into finding out what genitalia a person has...and assuming that they would act differently based on certain preconceptions about their sex...\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment:\\n\r\nI'm still enjoying it for now because it's rare for a show to highlight corrupted humans and actually encourage getting rid of them. And I personally enjoy watching Kino in action XD. Hopefully the show continues to be decent. \\n\\n\r\nRating: Wanted to give 10, because it's rare and hard to find a show doing well when it comes to human nature and morality... but sadly there are some major logic flaws in some episodes... So it'll be a 9 for me.\\n\\n",

            "content": "***Very mild spoilers for both this series and the original 2003 Kino's Journey***\r\ntl;dr The 2017 version takes the mantra \"The world is not beautiful, therefore it is\" and crushes it under the wheels of a thousand horribly-animated 3D-CG motorrads.\r\nWhy a 1/10? Why does this show deserve such a low score? Easy: There is no reason to watch it. The 2003 version is simply better than the 2017 version in every conceivable way\u2014in story, art direction, music, themes, characters, memorability, and quality. This remake offers no new original ideas, no compelling storylines, and no interesting allegories that made the original so beloved. Kino herself has beengutted as a character and replaced with a hollow husk of her former self\u2014a change that is sadly emblematic of the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nIt is predictable, boring, trite, and utterly unambitious. The heart and soul of Kino's Journey has been lobotomized in favour of a new glitz-ified \"more accessible\" version where the cardboard cutouts that pass themselves off as characters yell and scream and flail about in typical anime fashion. At no point does this show strike you with the 2003 version's sense of awe, yet this feels more like purposeful laziness rather than trying yet failing to clear the (admittedly high) bar set by the original.\\n\\n\r\nEverything in New Kino is handed to the viewer on an all-too-obvious silver platter. Not only are the complex philosophical issues of Old Kino missing, but there is no distinctive style: every background is overly glossy, every shot is staid and lazily-composed, and every frame of animation feels chintzy. Gone are the days where Kino riding Hermes around the countryside was given the dignity of normal 2D animation. The plot is an incoherent mess, with bizarre twists and turns coming out of thin air (seemingly having been drawn out of a hat at random). For all the extra characters and storylines the 2017 version introduces, none is particularly memorable, unique, or skillfully executed, and everything culminates in a thoroughly ridiculous and poorly-animated final episode so laughably bad it deserves a place in the Anime Notoriety Hall of Fame alongside Inferno Cop and School Days.\\n\\n\r\nTake the first episode of both versions. Old Kino presented a poignant, in-depth discussion of transhumanism, the nature of human interactions/relationships, the emotional toll of living out one's life in light of past mistakes, and whether science can/should try to rectify social/interpersonal problems\u2014all wrapped up in a tightly-executed and stylishly-directed 20 minutes. New Kino has a story where Kino arrives at a country, talks to some people for no reason, witnesses someone die in a cartoonish lynch-mob, and leaves. Neither she nor the viewer has learned anything about the country or morality or ethics or human nature at all. \\n\\n\r\nWhat is the point of this show? Why take a well-known, well-established series and strip it of all meaningful content? Where is the subtext, the subtlety, and the quiet contemplation that made the 2003 version such a classic? And if it is argued that Kino's Journey doesn't HAVE to have these things, the 2017 version does a fine job proving that Kino's Journey definitely cannot survive without them. The characters and world of Kino\u2019s Journey are much more one-dimensional and generic compared to other shows where such things are the main emphasis and appeal. The real quality of Old Kino was never found in the plot or characters per se, but rather in how it used them to present its philosophy and allegorical commentaries on society, humanity and the world as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nIs this show any worse than other shows this year? Probably not, but it all depends on what you value as a viewer. If you want mediocre brainless schlock, Kino's Journey 2017 is definitely for you. If you want something meaningful, something that stands out and makes you think, skip this and watch the original.",

            "content": "Note: I have not read the source material (novel), nor watch the previous anime adaptation, so this review will be based on the 2017 adaptation alone.\r\nKino no Tabi follows the titular Kino and her motorcycle Hermes as they travel from country to country. The appeal of the series supposedly based on the uniqueness of each country they visit, rather than some overarching grand adventure, so apart from some recurring characters, there is very little connection between the episodes, and indeed from what I heard it\u2019s neither in the order of the original novel, nor in the order of the previous adaptation.\r\nTherefore the enjoyment of theseries rests on how interesting or thought provoking each individual country/story is. While I had high expectations , in general the stories fell rather flat for me. A couple of them could probably be considered \u201cmemorable\u201d, but most range from mediocre to forgettable. And even the memorable ones are hardly masterpieces, just more unique than the rest.\\n\r\nThis is not helped by the fact that each story has to be either one episode or half an episode long, which makes some of them feel slow and drawn out, while others feel too fast and hurried. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending, however, was just... bad. I'm not really how sure how they can close of a series in this format, but episode 11 seems like a much more fitting ending than 12, which consists of bizarre story followed by Kino murmuring half-asleep about where travel begin and ends. It's just... completely anti-climatic.\\n\\n\r\nKino travels through a myriad of different settings, from rural to urban, from ancient to modern, from land to sea. It could have been a great visual feast, but instead Kino no Tabi choose to use a drab, faded, one-look-fits-all type of feel. It works in the sense that the world feels coherent despite the different settings, however it takes away the uniqueness of each different country, and make them all feel like clones with minor adjustments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter animation is somewhat stable, however there are serious problems with certain animated sequences, particularly the 3D ones -- oftentimes the framerate is so bad that it feels like watching a slideshow rather than an animation. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP, ED, and OST as a whole is largely forgettable, and nothing from the OST even pops into mind. It's just... bland and boring like most of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I\u2019d probably rate the best stories 8/10, and the worst ones 3/10, and the ending 1/10. The series as a whole would sit somewhere at 5/10.",

            "content": "Doing reboots, remakes, or any sort of revival of a certain work always seems to be an insurmountable task for just about any creator. It becomes sort of a balancing act where to the fans, the work doesn\u2019t stray too far from the original that it loses the point of the original was all about, and it isn\u2019t too similar that it feel like a rehash of what has been done before. It feels the need to appease old fans without blocking out new fans, and open up to new fans without insulting the old fans. When it comes to Kino\u2019s journey, well it comesdown right in the middle of all these and maybe thanks duely to the source material that the show proves to be a competent yet vapid dud.\\n\\n\r\nDepending on how you look at it kino\u2019s journey is either a remake or re-adaptation of the 2003 anime or light novel, respectively. The series follows a motorist and her talking motorcycle as they travel around to diffrent counties, which serve more as walled city-states than actual countries. Kino only stays in each country for 3 days and 2 nights which most of the story is focused on. As each country is truly unique on its own as each one fluctuates when it comes to technology, culture, and ideologies, so in one instance they can be in a futuristic country and in another they can be in a pseudo early-industrial europe. The world of Kino\u2019s journey isn\u2019t interested in constructing a cohesive world, but rather create small vignettes to look into different ideas, ethics, and purposes in life.  With the residents of each country, or just about any character serving as mouthpiece for some sort of idea. While kino serves as a stand in for the viewers as an observer for the events that happen in almost each episode. The shows are episodic in nature, and it usually goes comes full circle within or across an episode/s. However while this show does stay true to what kino is about, there are several aspects that it fails which the 2003 kino\u2019s journey did better.Now don\u2019t take this as me being nostalgic over the original show since i only watched a bit of it when i was younger, and only got around to finishing it this year. \\n\\n\r\nSince kino\u2019s journey is an episodic series with no clear overarching structure the show had the ability to tread new ground. Which it did as the show ventured into new countries, and meet new people. Yet at the same time it also has episodes where it retreads over what the previous show did. It\u2019s because of this that i can\u2019t help but compare the two shows, and why this series isn\u2019t at the same level as it\u2019s predecessor. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this version of kino is more polished when it comes to its production value, the same can\u2019t be said about its writing. The show comes off as predictable as the end result or at least how the show will pan out can be seen way before the halfway point. While being predictable isn\u2019t a bad thing, it starts to become very weary after each episode. It\u2019s also because of its predictability of the show that it starts lacks any sort of driving point to any of the episodes. Even its darkest of moments feel empty as all it can do has been presented and it has nothing more to say. While the older one was very on the nose on what message it was trying to convey, at least it tried to leave something thoughtful for the viewers to leave with. There\u2019s also a pacing issue that happens in one episode mostly due to the fact that the older version lasted on that country for 2 episodes. Even in the older version it was one of the lower point in the series, but compared to this it changed my perspective on how well done it was in the older version. \\n\\n\r\nNow these two come off more as nitpicks about thing i personally didn\u2019t like which may not have bothered others. The first being that some of the episodes are wasted on other characters rather than on kino. I get that the show wants to focus on other characters that kino have meet on their travels, but this is called \u201cKino\u2019s Journey\u201d not \u201cKino and and other\u2019s Journey. It\u2019s not detrimental to the series, but i would rather the show just focus on Kino and only Kino. secondly is structure which is odd since it being episodic means it doesn\u2019t really have a structure, but this is mostly focused on two certain episodes. The episode that is about kino\u2019s origins, and the episode that sort of serves as a mirror between her and another character in that episode. It\u2019s the problem that it tried to do the same, but also being different at the same time that the episodes lack the sort of emotional impact that the older version had.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to come down as not liking the show. I still thought it was an enjoyable experience during the moment. It still had many aspects that made kino fun to watch even if not all of it was fully actualized",

            "content": "\u201cSometimes having a remake of a well-known series isn\u2019t a good idea at all because it can potentially damage a franchise for good\u201d -Me 2017\r\nThe Orginal Kino's Journey or as I like to call it OG Kino is an endless classic that many anime fans love. It had great worldbuilding, amazing themes, and messages; the episodic episodes were well told and well written that had a point. The characters despite being episodic were all memorable and likable due to them being well written. The visuals while being basic had great direction and cinematography and music while not having many tracks was still great. Plus boththe sub and the dub were very good.\\n\r\nWhile I was watching OG Kino I decided to watch the new Kino alongside with OG Kino weekly. After watching the last episode of New Kino as well watching the last episode of OG a day prior to watching the last episode of New Kino and am going to say this right now.\\n\\n\r\nNew Kino or as I like to call it Lerche Kino completely misses the point of the original series in every way possible as well completely disrespects fans of the original series.\\n\r\nAfter watching OG I was satisfied with what I watched, however, Lerche Kino makes me facepalm because Lerche Kino took everything that was great from the OG Kino and manages to fuck it all up to a point where I can say is THIS IS NOT MY KINO.\\n\r\nWith all that said Hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcomes to my review of Kino' Journey 2017 (Lerche Kino) and with that all that said let's us begin.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Lerche Kino is the same as the original Kino. It follows a young girl called Kino and her talking motorcycle Hermes and they travel to many different countries and forests, each unique in its customs and people. She only spends three days and two nights in every town, without exception, on the principle that three days is enough time to learn almost everything important about a place while leaving time to explore new lands.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Lerche Kino is a mess. A very boring, uninspiring and poorly directed mess.\\n\r\nTo get things started the show doesn\u2019t have much atmosphere. I know am talking about the visuals this early but this is the problem that Lerche kino and it hardly goes away. Because Lerche has almost no atmosphere most of the worlds that Lerche Kino goes to arc bland compared to the original. You see every Country in OG has a different and unique atmosphere that showcases the tone of each country as well as the theme. Lerche Kino hardly does this because each world that Lerche Kino shows are either watered down versions of OG Kino or they are just uninspiring new Country\u2019s that OG Kino did not showcase.\\n\r\nOne of the examples of Lerche Kino being uninspiring is in episode 1 A Country Where People Can Kill Others. That episode alone completely sets the wrong tone of the series which I will explain soon after a compare the first episode of OG Kino. The first episode of OG Kino which is called Land of Visible Pain where Kino visits a town where people with incredibly advanced technology, however, it appears that everyone is living in total isolation and shuns any contact of other people. Once Kino finally started to have a conversation with one the town residents he reveals the advanced technology of the town allowed them to modify their bodies so they can understand each other thoughts allowing for much easier communication. Ofbersly this idea eventually turned sour because it meant that people could no longer hide thoughts on each other and so the nonstop communication eventually drove everyone in the town into isolation. The main themes that were explored in that episode were human modifying, isolation and the consequences of relying on advanced technology. OG Kino did a great job with the first episode and its easily one of the best first episode I have ever seen in an anime.\\n\r\nLerche Kino Episode 1 A Country Where People Can Kill Others is a perfect example of how to not do the first episode. Kino travels to a country where murder is legal and the reason why she even wants to travel to that country is that she want's to kill someone just for her own satisfaction that she killed someone. She want's to kill someone not because she has a grudge against someone or anything like that but she wants to kill someone just for her own satisfaction. Do you see how this series completely misses the point? Not only that the episode itself doesn't really change the nature of the murder of that town not to mention there's barely any theme exploration as well having characters that you can sympathize with in that town.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me started with the Colosseum arc in episode 2 because that arc was atrocious. Not only the themes were butchered to hell but the pacing, writings, character interactions/development and production values were abysmal.  It felt like a badly made shounen series.\\n\r\nAnother problem with Lerche is pacing and worldbuilding. The pacing in Lerche Kino is honestly pretty damn bad. Most episodes just drag on to the point where you just get bored and let\u2019s be real unlike OG Kino most of the events of Lerche are not that interesting in a slightest due to the show butchering its themes and messages for no reason other than appeal to the lowest common denominator of anime fans who like watching crappy light novel adaptations from A1 Pictures. As for worldbuilding, it\u2019s very lackluster and almost none existent. Every Country in OG had a lot of detail put into it while most of the Country in Lerche Kino feels empty and lifeless.\\n\r\nHowever, I give Lerche Kino this.\\n\r\nAs much I dislike Lerche Kino colosseum arc Lerche Kino did a good job with the Kino back-story arc and it was the only arc that I can consider to be good in Lerche Kino,\\n\r\nOverall the story of Lerche Kino is terrible. It has poor pacing, butchered arcs, no atmosphere, barely any themes exploration.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show literally falls apart.\\n\r\nWhy because the characters in Lerche Kino are a complete bastardization to the OG counterparts.\\n\r\nSeriously it\u2019s like director Tomohisa Taguchi didn\u2019t even watch the original series while directing Lerche Kino.\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with Kino herself. What did Tomohisa Taguchi do to you? The original Kino is a transient being and her personality was kept to a minimum. What makes the original Kino so great are her unpredictable reactions.\\n\r\nLerche Kino has too much personality and she often portrayed as a little brat. What makes it worse he is her reactions which are almost predictable and this alone completely defeats the entire point of her character. Overall Lerche Kino is shit.\\n\r\nAs for the rest of characters. They are all bland and uninteresting which is honestly a shame because characters like Shizu and Shishou were interesting in the original while in the new one they are bland and uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters in Lerche are a big failure.\\n\\n\r\n2/10 \\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe original Kino wasn\u2019t the best-looking anime in the world is as it sticks to the old washed out color pallet for every episode but what the original Kino had over Lerche Kino is constantly as well having great cinematography.\\n\\n\r\nWhy am I bringing this up? Because the visuals in Lerche Kino is shit.\\n\r\nTerrible lighting, subpar character designs that are inconstant and constantly go off model, awful background design that doesn\u2019t fit with characters that are in it. What makes this worse is the camera shots and overall direction. For example Episode 1 we have a close shot of Kino traveling while the backgrounds are just burred out and overall less detailed. Also unlike the original Hermes is completely done in CGI and it was horrible. Poor Hermes you DESERVED better than this.\\n\r\nAs for the animation itself, it\u2019s pretty okay overall.\\n\r\nThe main reason why I really dislike the visuals of Lerche Kino\u2019s because not only it abandons the charm and consistently from the original but it actually butchered a lot of messages thanks to this shows shitty visual direction and poor camerawork.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the visuals of Lerche Kino are shit and it completely missed the point of the original Kino.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in Lerche Kino is bland and very forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are pretty decent overall and they fit into the series quite decently.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sub vs dub. They are both pretty good overall so I have no complaints.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nSo that was Lerche Kino. A bad remake that has terrible production values, shitty writing, butchered themes, lackluster characters and awful pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThis is honestly one of the worst anime remakes I have ever seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt completely misses the point of the original Kino series and it has no charm on its own at all.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one no contest one of the worst animes from 2017.\\n\\n\r\nYou better off watching the original Kino and completely skipping Lerche Kino.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 3/10",

            "content": "Kino's Journey: the Beautiful World, shortened to Kino's Journey, is a Japanese light novel series written by Keiichi Sigsawa, with illustrations by Kouhaku Kuroboshi, which is still being published. A 13-episode anime adaptation was produced by A.C.G.T and Genco aired between April and July 2003. Two manga adaptations were produced, and a new anime series aired 12 episodes between October and December 2017. As of 2017, around 8.2 million copies of the novels have been sold in Japan. Newtype USA (a monthly magazine publication originating from Japan, covering anime and manga) named Kino's Journey the Book of the Month for November 2006 and called it\"inviting and addictive,\" while AnimeOnDVD said it \"sucks you in,\" and \"allows you to experience the journey\" together with the main character of the series, Kino. The series has a huge fan base, including the fact that the series is usually mentioned in Takarajimasha's light novel guide book Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi!.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, you do not have to watch the original series to understand the new remake. It is still highly recommendable to watch the 2003 version after finishing the newer one. However, do not think that the original is much better than the remake. What I am trying to say is that if you do not like the remake, there is no need for you to watch the original series. Anyways, for those who do not know anything about that title, I will say it one more time, you do not have to watch the original series first; however, if you are a fan of old animation, you can watch the original first and after it watch the remake. It addition to this, if you think that you can call yourself a fan, consider reading the novel, too.  By the way, I would also like to mention the fact that I am going to refer to the main protagonist of the series (Kino) as they. While their gender is not a major spoiler, but there is a story about it, and I do not want to spoil it; it is for you to find out. \\n\\n\r\nKino\u2019s Journey tells us a story of Kino, who is on a never-ending journey. Their journey started in 2000 and now there are 20 volumes that describe the beauty of Kino\u2019s journeys. Kino, together with their motorcycle, travel to different places and countries that have their own customs and laws. As a general rule, Kino only stays in each place for 3 days. During these three days the story will show you the most beautiful places you have ever seen in your life, or perhaps even the cruelest country you have ever seen. There is always a philosophical dilemma that Kino has to solve and these dilemmas sometimes involve some serious decisions that might put Kino\u2019s life on the line. \\n\\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that the series used to be very popular in 2000; it still has quite a remarkable fan base. Just like me, you might have seen the original in 2003, or even started reading the novel in 2000. In that case, you already know the whole beauty of this series. If not, Kino\u2019s Journey is definitely a huge pearl for those who like slice of life. However, if you believe that this genre is too boring, but still want to watch the series, I would highly recommend you to watch only two episodes a day, otherwise you might find it boring. I also want to concentrate your attention on the fact that Kino\u2019s Journey is not your usual slice of life; you will find philosophy, many life dilemmas, some really tragic scenes, and even some action scenes. Granted, if you are patient, this diamond will reward you with its reach story-line. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound wise, the new remake has a new voice actor cast for both Kino and Hermes, and it is quite a challenge to say if they are better than the previous one. They did their work quite well. As for the opening and ending themes, as well as for the OST, I am sure that the original series did a better job with them. But I would not say that it might be a big problem for you. Art wise, on one hand, the original has a darker feeling to it with its animation, on the other, the remake has a superb new animation, which also does its job the way it should: character designs, background; they all are stunningly beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nAs it has already been stated before, there are two protagonists in this series. Kino is the first main protagonist in the series. They travels to different countries with their talking motorcycle Hermes, which is the second main protagonist, discovering different cultures, customs and people. I am sure that it was one hell of a task for the new voice actors to voice their characters, but they managed to do it. The remake has not lost its best part--characters. The duo is able to keep you interested in what will happen next, providing you with the necessary character development. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to know my opinion, an opinion of a hardcore Kino\u2019s fan, the remake deserves its name. I will not try to hide the fact that I am really disappointed that the old voice actors did not take part in the remake, but the new cast still did one hell of a job. Kino\u2019s Journey (2017)  is still the anime that I watched long time ago. \\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: a very weak 10/10. \\n\r\nAll in all, Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World (2017) is a show that I would recommend to: a) all Kino\u2019s fans, b) all fans of the SoL genre. However, if you are not a fan of the genre, as it has already been mentioned in my review, you should either watch this anime little by little, or you should just avoid it. Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World (2017) is, indeed, a worthy remake. I hope that you will enjoy your journey with Kino and Hermes!",

            "content": "\u201cYou stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox and now, you\u2019re selling it...\u201d -(I really hate that man)\r\nKino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - The Animated Series, or, Kino\u2019s Journey: The Beautiful World - The Animated Series as the gringos say (they don\u2019t), is nothing short of one of the most disappointing experiences I\u2019ve ever had to slog through, and I\u2019ve graduated college. This contemporary adaptation of the light novels of the same name written by Keiichi Sigsawaand illustrated by Kouhaku Kuroboshi also serves as a hard reboot/remake of the previous anime. If you couldn\u2019t extrapolate already from my derisive tone, I admire the original adaptation immensely. \\n\\n\r\nRemake and reboot culture has been running rampant in Hollywood for a decade now and apparently, its vile stench has begun to reach across the pond. Usually, when it comes to remakes or reboots of any kind, the popular attitude when approaching them is one of \u201ccautious optimism\u201d. I\u2019d like to say that my attitude when it came to the announcement of this streamlined version of Kino\u2019s was along those lines despite controversies surrounding the production staff and studio. I generally take gossip like that with a grain of salt, especially with a framework like Kino\u2019s which in theory should be royally difficult to botch. Vitriol aside, the primary objective of any adaptation should be to stand alone from its source material, whether it\u2019s a panel for panel or word for word reimagining. Taking the light novels and original adaptation out of the equation does nothing to aid this clumsy and uneven series, one that will likely be buried worse than its hidden gem of a big sister. \\n\\n\r\nTime for the technicals. One of the biggest points of contention, when it came to this series, was its less than stellar production staff. I have time and time again been proven wrong by certain studios and animators but sadly I can\u2019t vouch for this go at Kino\u2019s Journey. If I could summate my thoughts on the art and animation into a single word, it would probably be \u201csafe\u201d. Nothing about the animation or art direction wowed me, nor do I really care all that much if it did (Kino\u2019s 03 wasn\u2019t exactly adored for its production qualities). The character models were polished, but entirely standard issue. On the topic of character models, Kino\u2019s model was misguidedly off the mark. When Kino is made to look like a scrapped design off the cutting-room floor of a KyoAni drawing session, it entirely ruins one of the most vital aspects of her character (more on that later). There was nothing egregiously awful about the animation, aside from a few cut-corners with reused CG shots of Kino and Hermes. With the simplistic character models, I don\u2019t imagine it was terribly difficult to animate and polish this series as much as they did. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was entirely unassuming so I\u2019m not going to bother expanding my thoughts on it. Most newer anime are more concerned with how polished the aesthetics are, the soundtrack is usually secondary or tertiary. The opening and ending were skippable and most episodes didn\u2019t even have time to fit them in. Aoi Yuuki\u2019s performance as Kino was serviceable at best and derivative at its absolute lowest. I enjoy Yuuki\u2019s roles however it didn\u2019t sound like she was attempting to differentiate this one from any of her other characters. I contend that Mariya Ise or even Miyuki Sawashiro would\u2019ve been better fits for this role. For you dub purists out there, it\u2019s safe to say that this dub is perfectly passable (no funny business with the scripts as far as I could tell...screw you Funimation), but it\u2019s nowhere near as good as the OG\u2019s very underrated dub.  \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not entirely informed on the process involved in cherry-picking the storylines to adapt from the light novels, however from my understanding, these storylines were voted on in some kind of popularity poll. If that\u2019s true, then that just goes to show how much of a disconnect there is between producers and fans who have no idea how the \u201csausage is made.\u201d The dozen or so storylines leave this adaptation feeling episodically inconsistent. Varying greatly in tone, scope, conflict, and characters, this adaptation feels as if it was only ever really interested in exploring the more shallow/surface level thematic elements in the individual countries. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of squandered potential in these episodes, to say the least. For example, there was one particular episode that presented a pretty interesting moral quandary with a country that was constantly moving but in the process would trample and ruin other countries...however, most of the meatier content and thematic undertones are glossed over and played for comedy, shallow action, and a predictable/boring conflict. Despite the original adaptation\u2019s similar approach of varied storylines, it at least provided a consistent utopian throughline that made each episode weave perfectly to create a consistent product. Tonally, this anime feels like a Jackson Pollock with shades of other shows thrown on a canvas that once resembled Kino\u2019s Journey. Except I\u2019d probably have more fun staring down a Jackson Pollock for 4 hours as opposed to wasting another 4 or so hours watching this show. Kino\u2019s is often considered slow and thinky, which on its own isn\u2019t necessarily a valid criticism as much as it is a matter of taste. Kino\u2019s (2017) wasn\u2019t slow or thinky in its execution as much as it was dull and uninteresting which is one of the biggest crimes for a self-contained episodic series. \\n\\n\r\nTo an extent, I agree with the sentiment that Kino serves as more of a neutral framing device to the actual star of the show, the titular journey itself. She is androgynous because her gender doesn\u2019t matter (see my grievance with her character model), her age is vague, and her backstory is seldom explored because it has little importance to where she is now. However, there is one problem with this adaptation\u2019s interpretation of Kino...SHE IS HARDLY THERE TO EVEN BE A FRAMING DEVICE. Sigsawa\u2019s minimalist approach to Kino\u2019s characterization is deliberate, she is our wish fulfillment and wanderlust incarnate, our eyes for this exploration into the deceptively darker side of humanity. Taking the character model out of the equation, they only really got HALF of her character right. Kino was not there to be the eyes for the audience, and when she was there she only half-assed her role. It\u2019s like when Brando showed up to Apocalypse Now overweight and needing his lines fed. Kino aside, there are no compelling or noteworthy characters to speak of. Shizu, Tii, and Riku are hardly worth mentioning were it not worth noting that they are relegated to secondary protagonists in \u201cKino\u2019s Journey\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the best episodes of your reboot/remake are the ones that were practically shot for shot reskins of their original counterpart, there\u2019s a problem. Kino\u2019s Journey is a source material rife with content that would\u2019ve made for excellent food for thought had it been in better hands. Some of that content was explored in this anime but ultimately handled with little care, making for a half-baked soulless product. Utterly devoid of any nuance or didactic philosophical charm that the original provided in spades, Kino\u2019s (2017) was a sorry attempt at streamlining the source. The only subtlety to be found in Kino\u2019s (2017) is its subtle crawl towards commercial territory. Sadly, some of the episodes are mostly above average in quality when compared to a typical gimmick ridden, thrown together, edge-biting seasonal. Despite that grading curve, I cannot award this show more than its individual merits will allow. I love Kino\u2019s but this just wasn\u2019t up to the expectations that were previously set.  \\n",

            "content": "So all the reviews (at the time) haven't seen the original Kino's journey, I haven't either until yesterday and I can completely say if you like the 2017 version and can tolerate a bit of old animation, the 2003 adaptation is worth the watch.\r\nIn this review I want to compare the two, hoping to better describe the show.\r\nStory\r\nBoth versions are episodic, revolving around Kino, the most bad-ass flat chested girl I ever seen and her motorcycle. Each episode is suppose to be thought provoking with \"what if's\" and highlight the faults of humans. There's lot a lot of action and the pacing can feel abit slow at times, but the shocking stories make up for it at the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art is nicely made for the show making the world feel vast and both beautiful despite the chaos around it. The animation is well done as well, although the obvious CGI moments can throw someone off, but we can ignore that right?\\n\r\nCompared to the 2003, the art and animation is obviously going to be worse due to time gap, but dispute that it excels far better in a composition of a shot; making every frame count with little details.\\n\r\nBoth are great at setting up the atmosphere and the tone of every episode, although the new version does a lot of telling than showing while the old version creates a more human feel without unnecessarily making Kino a talk bot.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n2017 version excels in almost every way in terms of music and background noises, although personal preference, I enjoy the 2003 Opening better\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nKino's new design is completely gorgeous and well fitting as she's portrayed slightly more sarcastic and cold hearted in the new version, many of the supported characters are well done as well giving off their personalities at a moment's glance. Due to this show being heavily human based, most of the emotional scenes are human interacts, but because of the heavier tell and less shoe aspects of the newer version each episode doesn't have enough time to flesh out each character or define a real motive other than \"just because.\" Thankfully, this doesn't hinder the story too much as well can still experience every situation thrown at Kino with surprise.\\n\r\nOther the other hand, I believe the 2003 version does a better job fleshing out it's characters, although Kino's personality is a bit stale the vibrant cast of side characters are more than enough to balance it all out, highlighting their personalities and motives without needing to say what their personalities are. Kino, although still being a bit cold, is shown to have a better understanding and passion towards the world making it heartwarming when things turn out alright at he end.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, both are great shows and the ideals questioned will never be outdated. Both have aspects that make them standout despite having similar atmospheres and it seems like where one version falls the other excels.",

OP and ED theme stands out very much\r\n4. Likable cast of characters\r\nCons:\r\n1. May not be as deep and philosophical as the 2003 version, as what I heard from fans\r\n2. Constant CG usage, may bother some people\r\n3. No character development \r\n\r\nBefore Fall 2017 even started, I was very hyped for this series. If you don't know, I love anime with interesting world for me to explore. That's why I adore Made in Abyss last season. Well, after hearing a lotof complaints from fans of the 2003 series, is this show still worth watching? I don't know if my opinion can help but imo this series is definitely worth my time. \\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about Kino's Journey is the world. Of course for a series about our main character traveling from place to place, if the world isn't interesting, then this will be a stinky pile of garbage. However, Kino's Journey really did pack in a beautiful world for me to explore. I enjoyed myself learning about each countries Kino traveled to. Each of them are very unique and interesting. I'd say if you love world building in anime then be sure to check this out. No, YOU MUST CHECK THIS OUT.\\n\\n\r\nThe 2nd part I like about Kino's Journey is it's art and animation. The scenery for each country was beautifully drawn and that's enough for me. If an anime about traveling can't draw the scenery correctly, the it fails hard. Fortunately, Kino's Journey packed in quite an eye-catching scenery for me to look at and to love. The animation, although there are an awful ton of CG usage in some episodes, but as I'd say before, I don't hate CG. The CG in this series is natural, I guess. It didn't bother me that much but I'd say the art itself covered up the shit CG. I can forgive the animation because of the beautifully drawn art.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I love the OP and ED theme for this series. It's sung by Yanagi Nagi, who if you haven't heard before, sang the OP for SNAFU and Just Because. I really love her voice. It's soothing and calming. The background music, also didn't stand out much, was still well-placed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, I like Kino. But other characters I don't really care much about. Although they did show us the backstories of other travelers, but in the end I watched this series for the world building and it already satisfied me, so even if the characters didn't stand out much to me, I still won't hate this series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed myself watching Kino's Journey 2017. It's a refreshing watch and for a person who likes world building like me, this series is perfect. Now, if you excuse me, I'll head over to the 2003 version. 8/10 That's it for my review. Thanks for reading. :)",

Without wishing to commit the misdemeanour of spoiling the story, Kino's journey may be summarised as simply as Kino and his motor bike Hermes, which can speak, travelling around different countries and visiting there for a maximum of three days.\r\nKino is often very fair in assessing each country he visits, and whilst he does hold his personal preference towards one over the other, this may be at its subtlest and reflectsthe cultural relativist's idea that no single culture is morally significant to the other. The strong contrast between characters native to their country narrates the discernible lack of objectivity, nor the common nature between them. For aspiring philosophers, like yourself, this is a highly recommendable series to indulge in; alas, apart from the visual portrayal of cultural relativism the series perhaps lacks in enthusiasm, or a dynamic coherence between each episode compared to other series such as Code Geass.\\n\r\nNevertheless, such criticism may not truly reflect the weaker side of this series, as one may be dubious in comparing Kino's journey to Code Geass, and the watchers aren't necessarily expecting a plot-twisting anime with cleverly fabricated foreshadowing, but a more contemplative time to enrich his day.\\n\r\nI must admit I haven't watched this series for over a year, so maybe I'm not covering a pivotal aspect of it, which other reviews may have adressed. Hopefully, my point has been delivered across to the reader enough to encourage a quick peak of the first episode. My personal highlight was episode 10; for the more time-restrained watchers, perhaps starting with episode 10 isn't the worst point of entry, as most episodes don't necessarily follow or introduce each other anyways.\\n\r\nApology goes to the long read, for those tolerant enough for the full review. I understand the hypocrisy of opening the review claiming brevity and clarity, and end up writing the non sense I feared I was going to do so, but in hindsight nothing has been regretted.",

            "content": "Kino no Tabi is almost more like reading a philosophy essay on human nature than watching an anime. However, the way in which the characters and story are woven into the exploration of various different \"types\" of human nature makes it enjoyable as both an anime and from a philosophical standpoint. Kino no Tabi develops the elements of anime that are most important to its themes to their fullest, but still manages to develop the other elements to an incredible degree.\r\nNext, a small breakdown of the individual elements:\r\nStory - Overall, this was one of the weaker elements. However, I still found it interesting, especially becauseof its unconventional nature. Everything tied together very well, and each of the subplots (most of them based in one particular episode) were resolved to a satisfactory degree.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art was incredibly well done. The beauty of it really helps to convey the world that Kino lives in, and helps to convey the story. My only issue was with a few of the 3D scenes, as some (not all) broke the flow of the animation for a moment. Most of the 3D scenes worked well enough, however.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The exploration of character is what gives this anime its unique, philosophic viewpoint. Therefore, character is very well done. The development of character, as well as the revelation of different parts of character, makes each episode unique and enjoyable. This includes not only the major characters, but also many of the minor and side characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World has been one of the most enjoyable anime that I've seen recently. The philosophic standpoint, combined with interesting worldbuilding and incredible art, makes for an interesting and pleasant experience.",

            "content": "Have you ever wondered what Kino's Journey would be like if it were garbage?\r\nWell, look no further friend!\r\nI shouldn't have to spell this out, but this is a review that draws heavily on comparing the two Kino anime. It is not an objective view of the 2017 anime alone. I would have found it boring and shitty regardless of the 2003 show's context, but then this review would lack the indignation of seeing everyone's favorite anime indie art film reduced to a cheap and casual throwaway series.\r\nAre you new to Kino's Journey? Well lucky for you the whole original series is available on a numberof streaming services for free and there's no need for you to waste your time here.\\n\\n\r\nMemorize the phrase \"boring and shitty\", because that can be used to describe most of this tonally devoid, shallow, toothless, low IQ series.\\n\\n\r\nTHE PREMISE:\\n\\n\r\nKino's Journey is the tale of a person named Kino who is on a Journey. WOW, right? But it's not a traditional adventure story, it's a much more philosophical one. Every few days Kino stops at a country for exactly three days, takes in the culture, and leaves. Every different country presents a different moral dilemma to consider, and Kino serves as an outsider looking in, generally choosing not to get wrapped up in their affairs, though sometimes it happens. You'll get presented with prompts that make you wonder about the nature of communication, humanity, society, free will, morality, etc and each adventure is a fable with a take-away. Like a demented book of fables, Kino shows us something about our world by exploring the one she lives in.\\n\\n\r\nIf that sounds great, this is not the series for you. Basically this adaptation is about one of the girls from K-On! scooting around shooting people with a psychotically apathetic smile on her face, presented in the most boring ways possible.\\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY:\\n\\n\r\nThe original Kino's Journey introduced us to Kino, the philosophical nature of her Journey, and the shit she has to go through and how she copes with it.\\n\\n\r\nThis adaptation opens with Kino eating cake and then some guy gets murdered, with the moral of the story being \"if everyone owned a gun, society would be peaceful\" and that's about it. Kino then goes to a place and kills a bunch of people for the sake of testing her skills and avenging a character we're never introduced to. She never shows emotion and seems completely disinterested in everything that's happening around her. She has no established rules or moral code and by episode three she's a traveling murderer and not much else can be derived from her time on screen.\\n\\n\r\nTHE ART and ANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nThe original Kino was low-budget for sure, it was indie as hell. But it had incredible direction and cinematography to make up for it. The series original series is moody, tense, eerie and kind of surreal. It sticks out even today as something of visual interest.\\n\\n\r\nThis series looks like Sword Art Online. All the characters look the same. All backgrounds devoid of real detail. All colors are bright and cheery at all times. All camera angles are flat shots of talking heads or just panning shots of nothing. There is no cinematography going on here. Kino's bike is CGI because modern Japanese animators can't fucking draw, but they're also paid $500 a year, so who would want to?\\n\\n\r\nThe opening sequence is a poppy borefest of BIRDS BIRDS BIRDS because Kino said something about birds once. It's like this whole thing is directed by a high school student.\\n\\n\r\nWHAT DOES IT SOUND LIKE?\\n\\n\r\nThe original series' music is pretty cool, with acoustic guitars and panflutes and one damned great OP.\\n\r\nThis series has jpop. It's about as generic as an OST can get. It feels very upbeat at all times, no matter what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nKino here sounds kawaii. Her bike's voice actor sounds like, uh, Mechazawa from Cromartie High? Soothing and male? Originally the bike's voice was grainy and cynical-sounding, adding to the series' eerie atmosphere. In this one, the voice aligns with the series having no atmosphere at all, so I guess it's fitting.\\n\\n\r\nAll side characters sound as over-acted and generic as you could expect anime characters to sound. Kino's Journey has gone from one of the most off-beat Japanese properties to one of the most unimaginative and anemic.\\n\\n\r\nARE YOU JUST MAD THAT IT'S DIFFERENT?\\n\\n\r\nNo, I'm mad because it's shit.\\n\r\n2003 Fullmetal and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood are different series. They're both good and do different things with their different tones. One is a drama, the other is action shounen.\\n\\n\r\nB-BUT THIS ONE IS MORE FAITHFUL TO THE SOURCE THAN THE ORIGINAL ANIME\\n\\n\r\nI hate to break this to you bud, but the Kino novels are probably mostly crap, written by a hack, and the original anime's directors, writers and artists are what made the show memorable. I love Nightow, but no one wants a faithful Gungrave adaptation. It's the same situation here. The author supplied a cool character and premise, and people with more talent than he made Kino a franchise worth remembering. That's that.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has no tone. It's just bad and effortless. It's a lifeless application of \"How to Make a Marketable Anime in 2017 in 5 Easy Steps\" except they fucked it up because they applied it to Kino's Journey and not fantasy light novel #8473.\\n\\n\r\nThere's really nothing redeeming here.\\n\\n\r\nGo watch the original.\\n\\n\r\nUnless you're just into anime because you want something that looks the same as everything else you watch and have no interest in thinking or feeling any mild discomfort at all. Then yeah, watch this. I hate you though.",

            "content": "It surprised me to see that many of the preliminary reviews were written by users who had not watched the original 2003 adaptation of Kino's Journey. While I believe it is admirable to judge the 2017 adaptation with fresh eyes and a clean slate, I also believe there is merit in comparing the reboot to its predecessor. As a disclaimer, I have not read the LN.\r\nPerhaps the difference between the two adaptations is best determined through their focus. The 2003 Kino no Tabi places greater emphasis on the world and the journey through its writing, episode sequence, and themes. The 2017 Kino no Tabi tendsto stress its characters over its world, though the 2003 version arguably accomplished this better as well in certain episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this year's adaptation if you are interested in watching a series that is not entirely sad, or entirely happy, but something that tries to display human hubris while keeping the spotlight on a cute, plot-armored girl. If you prefer something with more substance, greater focus on the world, equal prominence of the main character, and don't mind cruder presentation, then the 2003 original would be more gratifying.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally regarded to be more thought-provoking or morally ambiguous, the original anime owes its reputation partly to its director, Nakamura Ryutaro, who oversaw Serial Experiments Lain. This is not to say it lacked levity or lightheartedness, but the show very much exemplified one of Kino's mantras--The world is not beautiful; and that, in a way, lends it a sort of beauty.\\n\\n\r\nThe 2003 anime had moments of cruelty, of inevitability, of the human desire to change things for the better and of the tendency for those consequences to end poorly. It was also hopeful, touching, and a celebration of life. I want to make clear that the 2017 anime still retains most of these aspects. But the one thing that sets them apart is that Nakamura's version was far more subtle. There is little reading between the lines in the 2017 show, as characters do not hesitate to provide exposition or explain their motivations. It is hard to imagine the winter or library episodes existing in the current adaptation. Another major difference is the consideration given to Kino's backstory. The 2003 anime preferred to get it out of the way much earlier than the 2017 one, which pivoted our attention back to the world sooner. The newer adaptation keeps her origins hidden longer, as one might expect if the focus and suspense is on the main character.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, comparing the new and old series is like comparing day and night. The art of the 2017 version is fantastic. The lines are sharp, the colors pleasant. Kino's design more closely resembles her appearance on the LN covers. In contrast, the 2003 version was rough even for its time: the designs were cruder, simpler; Kino looked more aloof, easygoing, sarcastic, and shrewd at the same time; she also appeared more androgynous, lacking moe or particularly feminine qualities. There were times when this was a detriment, such as viewing palatability and reduction of stakes (it is far harder to lament the loss of a bland, ugly world than a colorful, detailed one). And yet the cruder artstyle of Nakamura's storyboards allowed greater appreciation of the nonvisual content of the show--the tracks, the story being told, the atmosphere. Sometimes what is less beautiful on the outside may surprise you on the inside.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of the 2017 reboot lends credence to its slice-of-life description. Overall the tunes are more happy-go-lucky than the original, but this is not a bad thing. I find the OPs and EDs to fit their respective shows, though preference will depend on the viewer. The VAs were perfectly cast.\\n\\n\r\nFor better or for worse, Kino is more expressive this time around. It's easy to say this is a demerit, that it draws attention away from the \"beautiful world,\" but it doesn't. It goes without saying that it is not necessarily wrong to give greater focus to Kino, for we accompany her journey through her eyes and her actions. Hermes remains mostly the same. The greatest departure the 2017 version makes, however, is the dedication of multiple episodes to characters other than Kino and Hermes. This decision allows viewers to see Kino's world from a different pair of eyes, and I found it a highly enjoyable break from the expected format. The biggest drawback is that these episodes take time away from Kino and her mostly non-meddling policy and the series would have been stronger for it if a second cour were planned.\\n\\n\r\nKino's Journey (2017) could be considered iyashikei. It is more casual, relaxing, humorous, and pleasant to watch, with a hint of thoughtfulness thanks to the source material. Kino's Journey (2003) could be called iyashikei, for different reasons. It is easy to call the new one an inferior remake, but overall it is neither worse than nor a reimagining of its predecessor. Some of its episodes are remakes, yes, but they have improvements as well as detractions. Parallels between both versions may be gleaned in a couple more. The rest are simply new stories presented from an angle that is perhaps more agreeable to the modern demographic.\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not the newest Kino no Tabi is weaker than the original depends on what you expect or desire. But for most people looking for a pleasant show to spend half a day on, I think Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - The Animated Series is worth their time.",

Despite that, Kino's Journey still left a sizeable impressionable, despite my bias against its visuals. It was, to use a tired phrase, thought-provoking, and it was told from the perspective of perhaps one of the greatest neutral characters I've ever encountered in fiction.\r\nAs a reimagining of the 2003 series, how does 2017 Kino hold up? For sure it looks a lot prettier. They clearly put a lot of effort into the3D on Hermes, but it's hard for me to say how much of the 'prettier' is just the fact that I can now watch in 720p. 2017 Kino is also much brighter and more colorful, where 2003 Kino was a darker, more subdued style. I could argue that both are completely appropriate, and I won't pick sides as to which is better.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the storytelling remains mostly unchanged. If you've never seen 2003 Kino, you're in for a treat. Kino is a story-of-the-week deal where Kino visits various countries, each of which have some specific quirk about them (a country where murder is legal, a country where rules are created by outsiders who compete as gladiators, a country where virtue is quantified and earns you points). Over the course of 20 minutes, the country's quirk is dismantled, exploited, and taken to its logical extreme, and all of the various consequences and fallout are put out on the table.\\n\\n\r\nKino, as a neutral observer and learner, tends to just let everything happen, and it leaves it to you, the viewing audience, to ponder. Would I really want to live in a place where murder is legal? Would I be okay with the benefits of living in a country that was always on the move, even if I knew the damage that movement caused? It's hardly practical philosophy without going to extreme lengths to relate it to anything realistic, but it's brain candy, and that's always a nice treat.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen either, should you start with Kino 2003 or Kino 2017? 2003 has my favorite episode of the lot, and it does a better job of capturing Kino's darker side. 2017 is just a lot prettier to look at and has a little faster-paced and easier-to-understand stories. If you're watching both regardless, start with 2003. Otherwise, pick whichever sounds better, you can't go wrong.",

            "content": "Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - The Animated Series has ended this Fall 2017 season. This was better then I first thought it would be. This show is about a girl named Kino, who along with her talking motorcycle, named Hermes, travel their world. They travel to different countries and stay for only 3 days to learn about that country's culture and people. These countries are very very interesting and are basically the backbone of the show. No countries are similar and are quite varied in many ways. From what they look like, to the level of technology they are at. Although the countriesare the main part of the show, the characters are also interesting in their own right. Kino is a bad ass, smart, chaotic good sort of character with a mysterious past. Hermes is a jokey, reliable, intelligent companion to Kino who has been with her most of her life. This series is episodic, you do not need to watch any of the episodes in order. The art of this show is sharp and polished, very beautiful. There is only one problem I have with this show which is the animation quality throughout. It is all over the place, sometimes there are just amazing scenes where the animation is crisp cool and clear, then there are some moments where it seems like the frame rate dropped about 5 frames sometimes. This doesn't mean much to me, but this can cause some problems to someone who cares about that sort of thing. The music is good, its silent most of the show, although the music swells where it needs to. I adored this anime. I give this show a perfect 10 out of 10. I recommend this to anyone who has time to watch this show, anyone can find something in this in my opinion. This has been your spoiler free but not really review on Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - The Animated Series.",

If you think you like this anime just go ahead and watch the original, it offers everything in this anime but better (except for the graphics).  The only reason I didn't give this anime a score worse than this is because it did manage to introduce new characters that we were interested in when we watched the original.\r\nThe original offered  a unique experience that allowed the audience to truly relate to each country. I find myself after every episode in deep thought due to the amazing story. The Kino in the original seemed morewiser and disciple. Although the Kino in this anime wasn't bad, she felt uninteresting and I wasn't able to get attached.   \\n\r\nOverall, ill say it's a decent anime but just go and watch the original if you want a better story that truly taps inside the human condition.",

            "content": "Ok, so after just finishing the last episode, I can say that this show is very hit or miss.\r\nThe story in each individual episode in quality from absolute dog crap to really fun and enjoyable/emotional. Let me provide examples:\r\nThe last 2 episodes are really fun for completely different reasons. Episode 11 is a really good backstory for Kino that made me enjoy the character a lot more and finally give at least some actual clarity on our main characters past. The episode is quite emotional and really well done. Episode 12, on the other hand, is a really fun episode that just entertains's the hellout of you for 20 mins and then ends. There is some fun action of Kino fighting a bunch of crazy sheep with fire and guns and ramming them with a car and it didn't really have any emotional impact or depth, but it worked because it was so fun. Other episodes earlier in the series give similar levels of quality, but some don't.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Every episode involving Ti and Shizu is mediocre, in my opinion. Well, not bad on an objective scale but compared to the other episodes they are usually kinda rushed, like Ti's introduction episode and Shizu's introduction episode both should have been two episodes or boring, like the second half of Country of Radio Waves (Ep.8). This would have given more time for me to care about them and enjoy their personalities more. The only story involving them that wasn't boring as hell or kinda rushed was the Country of Radio Waves which was considerably more entertaining due to the little bit of violence and Shizu's trick that he plays on the people, but besides those things it still pales in comparison to the better episodes involving Kino and Hermes. That is mainly due to the shorter second half of the episode which was an absolute schlock despite its brevity. However, Ep. 6 is not an episode involving either of these characters and it my absolute and uncontested least favorite. This episode doesn't fit in the show at all. It is a completely separate story with Kino shoehorned in at the end just to bring it into the show at least somewhat cohesively. It focuses on a little slave girl and how she accidentally kills all her slave masters, although they are disgusting humans so you don't really feel that bad, and how she grows up afterward. This was by a large margin the most obviously rushed and sloppily done episode. The girl grows up in a single cutaway and she has zero distinct or interesting personality traits. This episode has no emotional impact or almost any quality besides maybe the first couple of minutes before they start going through her life story at hyperspeed.\\n\\n\r\nI personally would have avoided episode 4, DEFINITELY skip episode 6, episode 8, and the Short section about Ti and her wish in episode 9, but that is just my opinion and you can watch them to form your own if you so please.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give the show an 8 because the episodes that do work are extremely enjoyable, and are the majority of episodes, and because it is an episodic show you can pretty much skip around if you really want to, but I wouldn't necessarily suggest it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I cannot say that I was a fan of the original Kino no Tabi, though I thought it was \u2013 overall \u2013  competently made. It sought to be thought-provoking and deeper than the typical anime, and it succeeded, even if not every episode knocked it out of the park. I ended up watching the new, 2017 Kino no Tabi on a whim, and I found it disappointing.\r\nThe new Kino is not a sequel or \u2013 not quite \u2013 a remake of the original, but rather an adaptation of several of the original short stories, about three or four of which were also adapted bythe original anime. Each episode is a stand-alone story centering on various countries found throughout Kino\u2019s world. Each of these countries typically has some unique custom or cultural value or attribute that sets it apart from the others, and much of Kino no Tabi is Kino\u2019s journey through these various countries, where she learns about their customs and then moves on. Some of these countries evoke interesting questions ranging from personal morality (eg. a country in which people do good deeds to save up points that allow them to get away with certain immoral acts) to the effects of globalism (eg. a wealthy country contained in a constantly moving fortress that would be devastated if the fortress stopped for too long, but which, in its movements, can have a negative impact on other countries). The episodes focusing on these kinds of countries tend to be Kino no Tabi\u2019s best \u2013 something true of both the old and the new Kino. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, these kinds of thought-provoking episodes are uncommon in this adaptation. This adaptation tends to focus less on the countries that Kino visits, and more on what she does whilst she\u2019s visiting. And it feels like much of what Kino does is resolved by a gun \u2013 whether hers or someone else\u2019s. Violence isn\u2019t inherently bad \u2013 at least in fiction \u2013 and I don\u2019t think violence can\u2019t be thought-provoking, and Kino only ever acts in self-defense, but I do think that violence can be overused as a means of creating and resolving conflicts, and I do think that the use of violence in fiction often creates a shallow conflict. Which is all to say that in 2017, Kino goes \u201cpow! pow!\u201d way too much.\\n\\n\r\nThough, to be fair, at least some of the gunplay comes from a cast of supporting characters. Whereas Kino and her talking motorcycle, Hermes, were the only two recurring characters in the original, this adaptation features a few episodes where Kino and Hermes barely appear, if they appear at all. The most prominent of the supporting cast are a fellow traveler, Shizu, and his talking dog, Riku. In contrast to Kino, who generally takes a hands-off approach when visiting new countries (she\u2019s a traveler, after all), Shizu tends to be more pro-active in righting apparent wrongs. Shizu features in three episodes, and is the primary viewpoint in two of them. For such a prominent character, I think that Shizu \u2013 and his approach to life \u2013 don\u2019t really fit the tone of Kino no Tabi. If Kino no Tabi is about a traveler (or several) visiting different countries and learning about what differentiates them and makes them unique, Shizu is someone who is closed-minded and oafish, with little interest in learning about others. If Shizu were a one-off character whom Kino meets on her journeys, he would be an interesting foil, but I don\u2019t think he works as a viewpoint character.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is perhaps one area in which the new Kino no Tabi can be said to excel. It looks not only like a modern anime, but a very fine one. Is it the best looking anime of 2017? I wouldn\u2019t know. However, every episode was pleasant to look at. The visual effects enhance the look of the animation, and the CGI, whilst apparent, isn\u2019t particularly distracting. Kino, likewise, looks better and far more suited to being a traveler than she did in the original. The soundtrack helped to accentuate whatever was happening on screen, without standing out too much. I am not the best judge of these things, but overall it looked and sounded good.\\n\\n\r\nThe new Kino no Tabi is definitely more accessible than the old, but that comes at a cost, I think. It looks nice, has more than two recurring characters, and tends to be more action-oriented, but it rarely poses any challenging questions. I find myself thinking sometimes of some of the episodes from the original and the ideas they presented; I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever think about anything from the new Kino no Tabi again after I finish this review. Of course, this anime being more accessible isn\u2019t bad, and I suspect that it\u2019ll interest people in the original Kino, but some of the differences make it hard to go from the old Kino to the new.\\n\\n\r\nI would say that if you are a fan of the original (or, if like me, you respect what the original was going for even if you didn\u2019t like it), you probably won\u2019t get as much out of this adaptation. If, however, you have never seen an episode of the 2004 Kino no Tabi, I think you\u2019ll find something of value in the 2017 Kino no Tabi. Perhaps you\u2019ll even like it enough to watch the superior, previous adaptation.",

            "content": "This is both a sequel to the old series and a remake of some of the most remarkable episodes within it. I'll try and avoid any spoilers here since this series is episodical so any spoiler would be an episode gone to waste. For the most part, I'll be comparing this series with the original one in terms of what has been improved and what has been demoted.\r\nStory\r\nAs I said, most of this are completely new countries that Kino visits so even if you, like me, did watch the original series this one is still going to be enjoyable for you. The remade episodes, however,aren't as good when compared to the original. Episode 2 is a remake of a three-episode arc in the original series so they've basically removed everything good in it and replaced it with Kino practicing shooting in the entire episode. The side-characters' development was erased, Kino's perspective of the country was left ambiguous and the relationships that Kino built with most the characters were mostly unmentioned. If you haven't watched the original this, probably, won't be a problem for you. Though, the rest of the remade episodes, three in total, were well-done and although weren't as good as the original, they didn't demote the original story as was with episode 2. In either case, the new episodes are completely new experiences and most of them were very interesting and beautiful so those you're probably going to enjoy regardless of whether you watched the original series or not.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely beautiful. The older version was fairly old so the style gave a somewhat dark vibe to it, which I frankly enjoyed. Nonetheless, this one is, in my opinion, far more suitable to the story since it intends to show the beauty of various countries and the experience of traveling from one to another. One good example of that is the scenery which have become so vibrant. Another would be the characters whom Kino encounters; the new art style adds a lot especially to the remade episodes. Kino has also become fairly more expressive and cheerful as well which I like to think of as a result to visiting that many countries and the encounters with the other travelers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development\\n\\n\r\nIn the original, the main character development we had was Kino's and Hermes' while everyone else felt like a supportive character. However, this time there are other travelers whom we see and they get their own fair share of character development as Kino does which acts as a good break to see other travel experiences. What makes it even better is their perspective of traveling is very different than Kino's. For Kino, traveling is for the sake of experiencing new things and exploring the world while for the other party, they travel mainly for the best country they get to settle in. Kino also avoids getting involved with any country no matter how absurd their way of living may be while the others apply their own beliefs and righteousness to wherever they go.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked the original, then you're definitely going to enjoy this one as well. New countries, new people and absolutely stunning scenery. Most of what you liked in the older version is still here with even more.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're new to the series and don't want to bother seeing the older version, this anime is mild when it comes to action, but it has its own share. It's going to be somewhat like a slice of life experience, but with traveling from place to another. Kino faces her own share of hardships and sad unpleasant encounters as she travels, but the fun and enjoyment of traveling overwhelm those greatly.",

            "content": "This review is available in English and Brazilian Portuguese:\r\nENGLISH:\r\n*This review does not contain spoilers and does not take into account the original product, as well as any other of its aspects (light novel, manga and other anime).\r\n\"The world is not beautiful, therefore it is\". It is with this phrase, present in the anime synopsis, that we can correctly summarize the story of Kino, a young traveler, and Hermes, his motorrad (a kind of motorcycle).\r\nWith a great dubbing job worth paying attention (starring Saito Souma, magnificent as Twelve in Zankyou on Terror, and Yuuki Aoi, striking in Gosick as Victorique), the story tells the adventures ofKino by the countries in which she passes, staying at most three days in each, which, according to her, is the ideal to know the customs and traditions of a place. Here, it is worth emphasizing the immense creativity in developing completely different rules and scenarios for each country, which fuels the curiosity of the viewer without letting the anime fall into the same or become too dull. It's all always new and different (although the same script will always be followed on each visit).\\n\\n\r\nWith a dazzling animation, full of colors and with abuse of the great general plan (which masterfully reinforces the open world feeling and freedom), unfortunately the series sins in one of the points that could raise it from very good to spectacular: soundtrack. Despite an Opening beautifully performed by Yanagi Nagi, the fantastic singer behind Nagi no Asukara Endings, Ano Natsu de Matteru and many others, it's a shame that Kino no Tabi's  soundtrack has just done \"homework \"(which is not to be expected from Satoki Iida, the sound director who was also responsible for the musical part of such great hits as Angel Beats and Tsuki ga Kirei).\\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between the principals works, and if it were not for the fact that Kino is a human, and Hermes a motorcycle, it would not be wrong at all to assume that they were blood brothers who have always been together since the beginning of their lives. But those who think that there are only two as recurring characters are deceiving themselves.\\n\\n\r\nAs charismatic as they are, the anime still reserves a few episodes to introduce other travelers and develop (albeit shallowly) their stories, and of course show the key character that made Kino initiate such a lifestyle (the episode in which him appeared is by far one of the most distressing and cruel).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I can not fail to mention the total exemption of time positioning. Without any rhythm of continuity between episodes, the show culminates in sporadic and punctual stories, almost a huddle of one-shots, not knowing when they occurred or how much time passed between them. Undoubtedly, this is due to the fact that this anime is only an adaptation of the favorite stories of readers of light novel in a contest of popularity, which makes it impossible to connect the facts of history. Anyway, it is absolutely possible to skip a few episodes (or almost all) and still be within the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nA brave anime, full of endings of imaginative and unexpected episodes (the feeling of surprise is constant during the watch), a pinch of fantasy, dialogues, monologues and a miraculous break of the fourth wall in the last scene, in which Hermes assumes the paper of the viewer, and Kino, the representative of the series in general. Kino no Tabi is more than fit to marathon on a rainy weekend accompanied by treats.\\n\\n\r\nPORTUGUESE;\\n\\n\r\n*Esta cr\u00edtica n\u00e3o apresenta spoilers e n\u00e3o leva em conta o produto original, bem como nenhuma outra de suas vertentes (light novel, mang\u00e1s e outros animes).\\n\\n\r\n\u201cO mundo n\u00e3o \u00e9 bonito, portanto \u00e9\u201d. \u00c9 com essa frase, presente na sinopse do anime, que podemos resumir corretamente a hist\u00f3ria de Kino, uma jovem viajante, e Hermes, sua motorrad (uma esp\u00e9cie de moto).\\n\\n\r\nCom um excelente trabalho de dublagem que vale a pena prestar aten\u00e7\u00e3o (protagonizado por Saito Souma, magn\u00edfico como Twelve em Zankyou no Terror, e Yuuki Aoi, marcante em Gosick como Victorique), a hist\u00f3ria conta as aventuras de Kino pelos pa\u00edses em que passa, ficando no m\u00e1ximo tr\u00eas dias em cada, tempo que, de acordo com ela, \u00e9 o ideal para se conhecer os costumes e tradi\u00e7\u00f5es de um lugar. Aqui, vale ressaltar a imensa criatividade em desenvolver regras e cen\u00e1rios completamente distintos para cada pa\u00eds, o que ati\u00e7a a curiosidade do telespectador sem deixar que o anime caia na mesmice ou se torne ma\u00e7ante demais. \u00c9 tudo sempre novo e diferente (apesar do mesmo roteiro sempre ser seguido em cada visita).\\n\\n\r\nCom uma anima\u00e7\u00e3o estonteante, cheia de cores e com abuso do grande plano geral (o que refor\u00e7a com maestria a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de mundo aberto e liberdade), infelizmente a s\u00e9rie peca em um dos pontos que poderiam elev\u00e1-la de muito boa para espetacular: a trilha sonora. Apesar de uma abertura maravilhosamente bem interpretada por Yanagi Nagi, a fant\u00e1stica cantora por tr\u00e1s dos encerramentos de Nagi no Asukara, Ano Natsu de Matteru e muitos outros, \u00e9 realmente uma pena que a soundtrack de Kino no Tabi tenha apenas feito o \u201cdever de casa\u201d (o que n\u00e3o \u00e9 de se esperar de Satoki Iida, o diretor de som que tamb\u00e9m foi respons\u00e1vel pela parte musical de grandes sucessos como Angel Beats e Tsuki ga Kirei).\\n\\n\r\nA qu\u00edmica entre os principais funciona, e se n\u00e3o fosse pelo fato de Kino ser um humano, e Hermes uma moto, n\u00e3o seria nada errado supor que eram irm\u00e3os de sangue que sempre estiveram juntos desde o in\u00edcio de suas vidas. Por\u00e9m, enganam-se os que acham que h\u00e1 apenas os dois como personagens recorrentes.\\n\\n\r\nT\u00e3o carism\u00e1ticos quanto eles, o anime ainda reserva alguns poucos epis\u00f3dios para apresentar outros viajantes e desenvolver (apesar de forma rasa) suas hist\u00f3rias, e, claro, mostrar o personagem-chave que fez com que Kino iniciasse tal estilo de vida (podendo ser citado que, o epis\u00f3dio em que esse apareceu, \u00e9 de longe um dos mais angustiantes e cru\u00e9is).\\n\\n\r\nContudo, n\u00e3o posso deixar de citar a total isen\u00e7\u00e3o de posicionamento de tempo. Sem haver qualquer ritmo de continuidade entre um epis\u00f3dio e o outro, o show culmina em hist\u00f3rias espor\u00e1dicas e pontuais, quase que um amontoado de one-shots, sem sabermos quando ocorreram ou quanto tempo passou entre uma e outra. Sem d\u00favida, isso se deve ao fato de que esse anime seja apenas uma adapta\u00e7\u00e3o dos contos favoritos dos leitores da light novel em um concurso de popularidade, o que nos impossibilita de ligar os fatos da hist\u00f3ria. De toda forma, \u00e9 absolutamente poss\u00edvel pular alguns epis\u00f3dios (ou quase todos) e, mesmo assim, ficar por dentro do final da s\u00e9rie.\\n\\n\r\nUm anime corajoso, repleto de finais de epis\u00f3dios imaginativos e inesperados (o sentimento de surpresa \u00e9 constante durante o assistir), uma pitada de fantasia, di\u00e1logos, mon\u00f3logos e uma mirabolante quebra da quarta parede na \u00faltima cena, em que Hermes assume o papel do telespectador, e Kino, o de representante da s\u00e9rie num geral. Kino no Tabi \u00e9 mais do que indicado para se maratonar num final de semana chuvoso acompanhado de guloseimas.",

            "content": "I'd never heard of this franchise before, but I absolutely loved this anime. I liked how the episodes are mostly separate, with somewhat different tones. I didn't find it *jarring* at all, just a natural part of the anime, and the variety keeps it interesting. The focus in each episode is less on Kino, and more on the story/drama of each of the weird countries she visits. I really liked Kino's unique neutral perspective; unlike basically every other protagonist ever, she isn't really trying to achieve anything in particular or change the world. With all that in mind, I think that the slow rate ofcharacter development for Kino was appropriate, and I would've been totally satisfied without any backstory for her whatsoever in these 12 episodes. In fact, I felt at times that it was being *forced* into certain anime plot tropes in a way which detracted from it.\\n\\n\r\nI mostly liked the art style, though in a few movement-heavy scenes they seemed to switch to a different (more computer-generated?) animation style which I found jarring. Audio was largely unremarkable.\\n\\n\r\nI hope they make many more episodes.",

            "content": "Let me start by saying that I went into this series expecting quite a bit from it. I watched the 2003 anime several years ago (in fact it was one of the first anime I ever watched) and I adored it right from the start. So I had my fingers crossed that this series would make me fall in love with Kino all over again - and it definitely did!\r\nStory: 9\r\nAll of the stories presented in this new series follow the same basic line that those in the original series did. They are quick, easy to follow, and often leave you think about human natureand just what is up with us all. One of the things I've always enjoyed about Kino's Journey is the fact that so many of the story are presented as very gentle and broadly for human nature. This series does that perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit that the animation in this series is nothing to write home about. There's a lot of awkward CGI and the art style itself is a little bland. Definitely not one of the high points of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very fitting all around and the voice acting is top notch. I really love the actors that they got to play Kino and Hermes in particular. They did an excellent job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nNot only do we get more of Kino in all of her glory, but several other characters from the light novel series get to feature in certain episodes. All of them are very interesting while still playing into the themes of the series - exploration of human nature and how hardships can form people.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nEven if it's not exactly the same as the 2003 anime, I enjoyed every minute of watching this series. It consistently delighted me and allowed me to relive the feelings I had while watching the original series. I definitely believe this anime is worth watching!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nLike I said earlier - it's not the 2003 anime. But it's still Kino's Journey and THAT is what I love about it and what makes it a very enjoyable watch.",

            "content": "When I finished watching the series I wanted to see what the opinions of others were, but it kinda bummed me out a bit when they referred to the lightnovels or the past adaptations. Not that there is anything wrong with doing so, its just that I would like to read on what the anime was, not what it was supposed to be. I myself haven't seen or read any Kino's journey material so this review will be fresh and vanilla, based only on this anime and specifically made for those others like me. \r\nStory:\r\nIf you haven't already read from the description (or thetitle of the anime) the story of the anime revolves around the adventures of Kino, a young traveler who jumps from country to country learning all the different cultures and practices of each place. \\n\\n\r\nThe flow of the story is erratic, meaning, for the most part, you could watch episode 10 without needing to watch the previous episodes. Although there are some episodes where you need to watch to understand the flow, this doesn't heavily affect your watching experience (trust me i accidentally watched episode ten after episode three and I still love this anime to pieces).\\n\\n\r\nThe different philosophies of each country were interesting for the most part, showcasing the different sides of humanity. It was extremely entertaining to watch the protagonist handle the different situations that come along the way. Each episode offers a treat, weather it be a lighthearted comedy bit or a heart-wrenching story it always brought something new to the table.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the anime was well done as the color pallet really helped show us the beauty in Kino's world. The vibrant colors puts you in a very peaceful trance and helping you set the mood of the adventure.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nLet me just get this out now: i LOVE the closing sound track. The music of the anime works so well in immersing you in Kino's world. If I were to name the feeling that the music brought out of me, the closest would be freedom. The music did such a good job in setting the mood of the anime from start to finish and it has certainly earned my praise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nAside from Kino and Hermes not much character development happened throughout the anime as the focused more on the adventure aspect of it. The supporting characters weren't exactly fleshed out and you don't really know what makes them tick, showing the anime's focus on the main characters. Although underdeveloped, it doesn't really hurt your watching experience.\\n\\n\r\nIf you watch Konosuba for its comedy, or Attack on Titan for its action, you would know Kino's journey for its adventure. Overall this anime is premium popcorn for anyone watching and is a special treat for adventure seekers, so if you couldn't tell from my review, I highly recommend you watch it.\\n\\n\r\n(And feel free to message me and tell me your experience ^_^)\\n",

            "content": "Note: I haven\u2019t seen the original, so this review is purely about the 2017 series.\r\nAll in all, a lovely anime. Serene and profound. Philosophical but not hard to understand. Almost every episode is a complete stand alone story, and really nicely wrapped up. Each story makes you go \u2018aah, that is brilliant.\u2019 There\u2019s a peaceful setting and mood, a muted colour palette and quite a slow pace. Music works out perfectly for the anime. \r\nI found the anime to be unique (I mean, I know it\u2019s a remake and all, but I\u2019m saying the actual story of Kino no Tabi itself is unique. I\u2019m sureI\u2019d give the original at least as high a score as this). Gives you an appreciation of the world and life, and a different perspective on events.\\n\r\nThe paradigm shift I experienced after seeing episode 5 was definitely the deciding point for me - I knew I was invested in the series after that. The twists are always wonderful to watch and never fail to add depth to the story, there\u2019s never a story that only has one layer to it or ends up being superficial. The anime\u2019s entertaining but more like life lessons than a fun escape from reality. And after watching it, I will say I too agree that \u2018the world is not beautiful, therefore it is.\u2019 Truly a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t, however, give it a 10 for two reasons: A) there were a few episodes (for example ep 4) where even though the story was good, the pace was just too slow and the episode ended up boring me as a result. B) I felt the ending was lacking \u2013 I just didn\u2019t get the same feeling from it (both full and empty at the same time) that I did the rest of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThese aren\u2019t really major faults, though, and I\u2019d most definitely recommend Kino no Tabi for anyone and everyone. Even if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s your type of anime, give it a go. It might help change your perspective a bit. \ud83d\ude0a XD\\n",

            "content": "My first impression of this anime is that the point of it is kind of like trying to knock off possible elements from a list that could create a utopia of sorts.  Each \"country\" they visit has it's own issues, own resolve, own people.  Some are bad and some good but the emphasis is on the pov of the people living in the country themselves.  As a traveler, Kino is smart and doesn't make judgements that override whatever the rules or governmental aspects, etc are and act without caution.  He might seem heartless in the fact that he, most of thetime, is calculating and only thinking of himself but most of all, he knows his goal is \"experiencing\" and not there for \"judging\".  That point is clear.  If you can't tell, I love this aspect of how the character was built.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't half bad at all.  But, it doesn't really have a story, it's very episodic with the two leads Kino and Shizu traveling (for two different reasons). Each country has it's own section of the journey these two take.  \\n\\n\r\nThere wasn't really anything noticeable to mention for sound so I just gave it a 6 for fair. The art was fine and worked for the story. Nothing noticeably special either.  But, overall, I did really enjoy it, so I gave it an 8.  \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this as a passing anime.  It isn't particularly good but it has a very interest set for the story, the theme of beauty is in the eye of the beholder type thing going from country to country.",

            "content": "***Minor Spoilers****\r\nI finished watching this series today after starting it last night. I would first like to say there must be a another adaptation or manga that you have to read/watch to understand this. Either that my personal view of the show will stand. First of all I would like to say I found the show to be almost incoherent. \r\n   You have all this time skipping back and forth with not notice. The only way you can tell is if you had been paying attention to trivial details (Woodsman in ep 2 I think, being acquired in Ep6 iirc). We add tothis blender of entertainment little to no backstory about our dull, and lifeless MC, and almost no world building other then the countries that are visited. Though I don't recall their ever being a discussion about why every country has walls 60+ meters high.\\n\\n\r\n  Lastly what was the message the writer was trying to convey? I cant be sure, other then maybe when people get together they do stupid things?  In each \"country(I use the term lightly as 20ppl does not a country make)\" We find everyone in complete agreement with each other regardless of how malignant the countries belief. I understand the \"countries\" are small but its difficult to suspend my disbelief.\\n\\n\r\n  That said the artwork was sublime, though i felt the soundtrack to be uninspired and not the least memorable. I feel a lot of people really hyped this show up, and so I am confused as to how it achieved such greatness. Everyone has different preferences(unless your in a country in this show) so maybe this show just wasn't for me. I will revisit it in a year or two.",
