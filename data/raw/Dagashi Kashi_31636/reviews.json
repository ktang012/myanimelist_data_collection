            "content": "Dagashi Kashi\r\nBy Kokonotsu Yen (9 Yen, 50 Cent's Japanese half cousin)\r\nI'll take you to the Dagashi shop\r\nI'll let you lick the watapachi-pop\r\nGo 'head girl don't you stop\r\nKeep going 'til you hit the Toppo, whoa\r\nI'll take you to the Dagashi shop (yeah)\r\nHotaru, one taste of what I got \r\nI'll have you spending all you got (come on)\r\nKeep going 'til you hit the Hi-Chew, whoa\r\nYou could have it your way, how do you want it?\r\nYou gon' sip that Ramune, or should I put some Pocky on it?\r\nTemperature rising, okay, let's go to the next level\r\nShikada-dashi jam-packed, hot as a tea kettle\r\nYeaaah, so, Dagashi Kashi: a show thatserves basically as a 4.5 hour commercial for various Japanese candy manufacturers under the pretense of a slice of life comedy. This show started off as a curiosity to me- it was charming in its simplistic, unassuming stance- as nonthreatening as an anime can possibly be. Yet at the same time, the early episodes had some really strange happenings that I can only describe as \"Japan\". This novelty was endearing for a while, and with the backdrop of the candy store- I though this show could be a fun little niche thing for a while, but the novelty soon wore thin. The beginning was amusing, but then quickly fell into a plodding middle- especially given that Dagashi Kashi shows its hand very quickly, and then continues to play the same cards, in a sense. It picked up again around the ending, promising a little more in the way of romantic subplots, but like most shows of one cour in length- ends up going absolutely nowhere. \\n\\n\r\nThis show features one of, if not THE smallest cast I've ever seen in an anime. 5 characters- and one of them appears in maybe two episodes. There are RARELY even unnamed passers by in this show- it focuses solely on the main 4: Kokonotsu, Hotaru, Saya, and To. \\n\r\nKokonotsu is our put upon protagonist- charged with running his absentee dad's candy shop (which apparently is famous, yet has no other customers besides mostly Hotaru, but also Saya and To). He flip flops between being white dwarf-level dense and a go-getter, but ultimately settles for being another trope-guy. \\n\r\nHotaru is a rich heir to a prominent candy manufacturing family, whose airheaded-ness is surpassed by only her obsession with eating candy. So much so, that she even frequently hallucinates that she is talking to, making out with, or otherwise in 'actual' love with candy. She a freak, though. \\n\r\nSaya and To are twins, and the best friends (and possibly only other people in town?) of Kokonotsu. To is the typical good natured perv friend, and Saya happens to be a master of everything she attempts (our perfect human being character), except the ways of love. \\n\\n\r\nOne last thing of note is the artwork. The overall design is very minimalistic, but one specific part of the character designs will stick with me- the eyes. The characters in this show have some of the strangest eyes I've ever seen. Hotaru has spirals instead of pupils, and most of the other characters have extremely beady eyes or look incredibly sleep deprived. It adds another odd element to an oddity of a show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is about as interesting as vanilla ice cream- but if learning the names of a bunch of Japanese candy and getting a sales pitch in animated form is exciting to you- by all means, give it a spin.",

            "content": "So Kokonotsu... do you wanna try becoming adults?\r\nSay yes you beta bastard, say yes!\r\nAnyways, Dagashi Kashi! This series was the one I was most interested in before it aired. Why? Because of that busty babe on the picture! And now, after watching it, I can confidently say that Dagashi Kashi was actually the complete opposite of what I thought it would be. I thought it was going to be a story about young Kokonotsu, an aspiring mangaka, and his struggles of dealing with Hotaru, that sweet sexy thang, who wants Kokonotsu to take over his dad's candy shop instead! Well, sure... that's kind of whatthe show is about. But is it really?\\n\\n\r\nNah.........\\n\\n\r\nDagashi Kashi is a textbook example of a \"nothing happens\" show. However, it isn't by any means boring! It isn't like Glasslip tier of nothing happens, it's more of like the things that do happen are borderline irrelevant to any sort of \"plot\" this show tries to tell.\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention \"plot?\" Well, I take it back, for there is none. Dagashi Kashi purely consists of skits and character interactions. As entertaining as some of these skits are, they really don't add up to become some amazing story. Quite the opposite, actually, for they don't add up at all! They are all their own little equations.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now most of you guys reading this review must wonder why I still give it a 7, and that is because Dagashi Kashi is by no means a bad show! In fact, it was one of the more enjoyable ones this season! Sure, since a lot of the jokes are about Japanese candy, and not a lot of you people are Japanese, you might think the jokes are incredibly hit or miss. But the extremely colorful and dynamic characters more than makes up for it! Dagashi Kashi is definitely an enjoyment > quality type of anime.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Great characters! They are all really characteristic and fun, and none of them are hateable.\\n\r\n- Very catchy OP and ED!\\n\r\n- I really like the character designs!\\n\r\n- Character interactions are very humorous.\\n\r\n- Surprisingly good use of flashbacks!\\n\r\n- There's romantic tension? What....\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Less story than Musaigen.\\n\r\n- While the character interactions are spot on, the jokes themselves are very hit or miss. For most caucasians, you won't find most, if any of the jokes funny. I'm Chinese, and Chinese candies are close enough. (Not really.)\\n\r\n- No memorable OST.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nBut Yuni, there is no story? Why not a 1? Well, that's because the events that actually do happen within this \"story\" are actually pretty entertaining! Each skit is usually about a type of candy or some event based around candy. It's a story that focuses A LOT on first world problems. And these first world problems are like ridiculous ones. Whatever happens depends on the candy. Sometimes it's a history lesson about why that candy exists. Sometimes it's some competition that connects to the candy. Sometimes it's a flash back of a memory that was triggered by the candy. These events range from boring, to educational, to entertaining. But at the end of the day, the characters are the same, the plot hasn't progressed whatsoever, and yeah. NOTHING HAPPENS!!!!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is great, although nothing noteworthy or overly impressive. I do like the character designs though! This show does have a pretty unique and interesting character design, and I think it fits the characters well, especially Hotaru, who's character design makes her look both mature (BOOBIES) and childish. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nOP and ED are incredibly catchy! Other than that, sound is average. OST is there but you won't remember it, and the seiyuus do a good job expressing their characters!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nArguably the best aspect of this series, the characters of Dagashi Kashi are just so enjoyable! Their characteristics aren't the most unique, but they are just so colorful and hilarious! Hotaru's little antics and habits are really funny and you can just see the innocence just seep out of her. Saya is your typical flat tsundere, but she still has so much character to the point that she became my favorite character of the series. Also, the interactions between kid Saya and kid Kokonotsu during flashbacks were just adorable. Tou also has a lot of personality, and of course, Kokonotsu's dad is just hilarious! Kokonotsu himself is pretty generic, but he has his moments as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nDagashi Kashi was actually really fun to watch for the most part! Whenever it got entertaining, it got REALLY entertaining. However, there were parts where it got pretty boring, but the entertaining parts completely overshadow the boring ones!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nDagashi Kashi is actually a pretty good show! It's light hearted and has no serious moments in it whatsoever, and is pretty much there just for fun. If you go in, don't expect any plot. But you may get some nice \"plot\" if you know what I mean ;)\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Boob ice cream? Take my money.",

Perhaps if you are Japanese and had grown up on Dagashi, this series is probably so slice-of-life that it\u2019s boring. As someone genuinely interested in the lifestyles of Japanese citizens beyond anime and pop culture, I found this anime quite educational! Not only had I never heard of Dagashi before watching episode 1, but it also gave me a look into Japanese childhood, and growing up in the Japanese countryside. I also love the silly characters, especially Hotaru. Ifyou are interested in Japanese culture as a whole, and you enjoy your light-hearted series\u2019, then Dagashi Kashi is for you! It helps that I\u2019m also a bit of a foodie.\\n\\n\r\nI was rather confused by the final episode, which almost completely lacked closure. Are they leaving an opening for a second season, or did they really just not know how to wrap up this anime?",

            "content": "Tl;dr 4.4 out of 10. no oppai, no plot, lots of talking about snacks.\r\nThis show starts completely different than it actually is. We start with a young aspiring manga artist who works in his dad's rural snack shop. It's a boring little shop with few customers. One day a pretty girl walks in and announces she's someone important and then goes on to challenge the main character in some snack themed contest and then does it again and again and again and so on.\r\nThe story pretty much derails after the first two episodes and falls into a formulaic feedback loop:\r\nStart of episode: boring snack shop.\\n\r\npart 1: introduce some mundane problem that a character acts like it's the end of the world (think first world problems). \\n\r\npart 2: somehow this has to do with a snack (no, really it doesn't). \\n\r\npart 3: the history and other random useless facts on said treat (boring). \\n\r\npart 4: some sort of bet is made (which they never actually do, no matter who wins).\\n\r\npart 5: a contest that usually doesn't make sense takes place (only part where something happens).\\n\r\npart 6: win or lose or don't complete the contest. nothing ever comes out of this.\\n\r\npart 7: the episode ends.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much it. This is especially odd since the first ep looks like this might have a bit of ecchi theme to it which is followed by some semblance of a plot and a promise of some high jinks, however that is the only episode that offers any of those things.\\n\\n\r\nIn the background there's an interesting slow developing love triangle with the two female characters and the main character. I really wish the story would have focused on that more as it is kind of interesting. The two pretty girls have good traits and the main character is likable but the show all but abandons them to play out a history lesson on snacks that you never knew existed, assuming you're not from Japan. I'd still wager that even if you are from Japan and/or you do know all of these snacks, you'll care just as little.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nOverall 4.4/10",

            "content": "At the time of writing this review, I have dropped this anime, with no plans to ever return and finish the remaining five episodes. This anime is boring. It is basically a Japanese candy commercial in anime form. Each episode is typically divided into two parts, with each part focusing on a different candy. There is also a weird crazy girl that knows too much about candy, and she is usually the one that introduces the candy of the episode. \r\nThe plot of this anime is relatively simple: Kokonotsu wants to be a manga artist, but his father wants him to take over the familybusiness: a candy store. Hotaru wants Kokonotsu's father to work for her family's candy company, and he agrees as long as she is able to convince Kokonotsu to take over the store. This makes Hotaru begin to harass Kokonotsu about candy all the time and allows the anime to become a Japanese candy commercial. Honestly, I had forgotten about the premise of the series because they hardly ever mention it again in favor of talking about candy all the time (can you tell how annoyed I am that I was roped into watching an anime that is literally just about candy?). \\n\r\nThe one redeeming quality of this anime is Saya. The episodes, or parts of episodes, that focus on her really stand out for me, but sadly weird crazy girl (Hotaru) gets most if the focus of the anime. I suppose if you want to learn more about Japanese candy you might find some enjoyment in this show. Being a foreigner with absolutely no previous knowledge of any of these candies led me to being either confused or bored at most of the content, and I couldn't justify finishing the series if I was just forcing myself to sit through it. 3/10\\n",

            "content": "Dagashi Kashi is for me the rare show that turned out to be different from what I expected, in a wholly positive way. No fanservice or wish fulfilment going on here, just unabashed dagashi nerdiness and fun slice of life.\r\nThe premise is simple: An energetic girl comes to a town out in the countryside and tries to encourage our protagonist, Coconuts, to take over his father's dagashi shop. The story is full of nice people, the characters are pretty much all likeable and behave naturally throughout the show. I find Coconut's father, You(his mom's name must be \"Me\") to be an especially fun character, heis really energetic and caring, the kind of father you hardly get in anime these days.\\n\\n\r\nYou have to be prepared though, the show throws a lot of facts at you which can get repetitive. Each episode is divided into segments that talk about individual snacks, which are chock full of history and small quirks about each specific dagashi. It helps to have a bit of knowledge about the kinds of sweets there are available in Japan, but for me I never felt lost, even when the jokes didn't hit there was usually something to learn.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does however have a bit of a slow start. The character Tou comes off as pretty mean in the first episode but gets a lot more enjoyable through the course of the show. Some of the sound effects are pretty stock, and Studio Feel's animation doesn't flow very well at points, but these are minor issues in the show. If you're a sucker for anything related to history or Japan I'd say you'd take to this show very well, there's a lot going on in Dagashi Kashi even though it might not be the most complex show out there. Its smart and uplifting, the kind of show that will never fail to brighten up your day.",

            "content": "Watching Dagashi Kashi feels nostalgic. It\u2019s nostalgic in the sense that makes you feel like a little kid again. Remember the first time you\u2019ve walked into a candy store and picked out your favorite sweets? It\u2019s that type of familiar feeling. Dagashi Kashi evokes a bit of childhood memories when I walked into a candy store for the first time. And believe me, this show likes to do a lot of funny things related to candy.\r\nThe series follows the episodic adventures of Kokonotsu Shikada. His encounter with Hotaru Shidare lands him in stories that drops him into the world of dagashi. Why? It\u2019s because Hotaruis part of a famous family owned sweet company. She wants Kokonotsu\u2019s father to join and he only agrees on the condition that Kokonotsu can take over his own shop. Thus, we got Hotaru and her ever daring tactics to get Kokonotsu for taking the shop. \\n\\n\r\nFirst thing to get out of the way: A good portion of the show relies heavily on comedy. It sells comedy through advertising of the dagashi. Hotaru is pretty much the mascot girl as she tries to appeal the wonderfulness of dagashi. From simple explanations, innovative lectures, or expressive dialogues, Hotaru is actually pretty good at convincing. Plus, she has the look (or \u201cit\u201d factor) to sell her product. The way this show is set up is that each episode has Hotaru trying ways to win Kokonotsu or others over with her convincing. Her personality is rather eccentric and overly dramatic whenever it involves candy. A good example is when she gets a mouth ulcer but still desperately wants to taste candy like in a ritualistic manner. Throughout the show, Hotaru also shows a vast knowledge about candy. The way she tries to convince others is rather overdramatic including getting others to play strange games or activities. So in retrospect, this is the type of show with little emphasis on plot but more on selling its premise.\\n\\n\r\nWith a small character cast, the show gives a decent amount of screen time for almost all of them. Kokonotsu (or as some of his friends call him \u201cCoconuts\u201d), is perhaps the most normal of the main cast. He is friendly, casual, and often tries to help others although remains oblivious to certain characters\u2019 feeling around him. This includes Saya, a girl that has obvious affections for him. Through his interactions with Hotaru, it seems like if he\u2019s developed an affection the titular character. In the meantime, there\u2019s Saya\u2019s brother Tou, who actually knows about his sister\u2019s crush on Kokonotsu. The only person that doesn\u2019t seem to know is Kokonotsu himself. And finally, we got Kokonotsu\u2019s father, You Shikada. Unlike his son, You\u2019s personality seems more similar to Hotaru with his hyperactive energy. The entire show focuses on these characters and the world of candy. When you have a diverse range character cast like this, it makes you wonder how the show can build around itself. The obvious answer is through character chemistry. Every episode may focus on candy but it also puts a bit of emphasis on character connections. Kokonotsu learns a lot from Hotaru, Saya grows closer to Kokonotsu throughout the show, and Hotaru also develops a friendly relationship with Saya. The show presents the character relationships in a comedic style rather than dramatic. In other words, don\u2019t expect actual love angles to develop as this series is about much more than a romance story. The only thing Hotaru has in mind seems to be candy while Kokonotsu remains dense as a neutron star about Saya. The family relationships (Kokonotsu/You and Saya/Tou) seems pretty typical and nothing out of extraordinary; the type you can expect between real life family members. But in essence, the show is down-right more of a comedic story.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there\u2019s some controversy with the way the series is adapted. For whatever reason, certain content is omitted from the manga about Hotaru and replaced by Saya. The show started with overemphasis on Hotaru\u2019s presence but in later episodes seems to also expose Saya a great amount of screen time. This seems controversial as it derives from the faithfulness of the adaptation and also gives Hotaru less relevance. Because let\u2019s be honest here, who here originally came to the series to watch for Saya? Hotaru is the main poster girl. In the meantime, the comedy of the show can be a mixed bag at times. It never actually changes despite each episode involving different scenarios, games, or whatever tactic Hotaru tries to convince others about candy. This also comes with a negative of characterization as background storytelling (with perhaps the exception of Saya) is largely absent. In essence, the show is really more of just popcorn fun to pass time at times.\\n\\n\r\nStudio feel helms the adaptation and thankfully provides good enough quality for the characters, backgrounds, and overall presentation. It has a countryside feel as the entire show never really ventures too far away from the candy store. However, the most noticeable part of the series is character design. Or rather I should say, one name. Hotaru Shidare. She has exotic looking eyes with ripple-pattern like rings in her iris. Combine that with a bit of lilac hair and you got quite a unique looking girl. Saya\u2019s eyes on the other hand looks rather simple and she dresses more casually than Hotaru. Oh and of course the show likes to take advantage of Hotaru\u2019s appearance so expect a bit of fan service; mostly subtle and satire by the comedic parodies.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and music goes hand in hand for the show. The OP song evolves throughout the first three episodes until we get a good glimpse of the style. While I can\u2019t say the music is very impressive, it does fit quite well for the show \u2013 being lighthearted and dramatic at time when it needs to be. However, the voice mannerism is what really sells the product with Hotaru yet again being the star. Her over-eccentric voice combined with personality is hard to ignore to be quite honest. Similarly, You is also ever energetic enough to be in the spotlight whenever his son seems to be indifferent about his life.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time this show is over, I feel like eating candy. No, it\u2019s not because Hotaru convinced me but that the show itself just seems to have too much fun to not jump into it. At the same time, the character cast is there to sell its comedy whether it works or not. As with any comedic series, the humor really needs to be exciting and Dagashi Kashi got that right in the palm of its hands.\\n",

            "content": "Dagashi Kashi is that kind of anime that you either hate or love as soon as you are done watching the very first episode. Yet I'm still surprised how low is the show rated here on MAL.\r\nInstead of pointing out pros and cons, let me comment on some aspects that people complain about.\r\n\"The show is advertising Japanese sweets.\". I mean... it is called *Dagashi* (sweets) Kashi, so the talk about sweets and their history is to be expected, isn't it?  \r\nEven the synopsis says, quoting: \"...And so begins Hotaru's mission to *enlighten* the boy on the true joy of delicious and nostalgic dagashi!\" \r\nThenwhy is it so surprising, that the characters often discuss facts about candy? It isn't. That's exactly what I expected and what I got. Facts about sweets. Often pretty interesting at that and occasionally humorous, too. \\n\r\n\"The show is not that funny.\" Yeah, probably because it isn't meant to be funny. I don't understand why is it marked as comedy / shounen here on MAL, when it is neither of that, it's a slice of life more than anything. It's supposed to make you smile, maybe giggle a little bit, but don't expect to laugh out loud.\\n\r\n\"It's repetitive.\" Like I said, it's a slice of life. Life is repetitive. What do. Live on.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I'm done ranting, let me just say that I genuinely enjoyed it. I mean the show, not life. \\n\r\nHighlights? Characters are great, Saya is the best waifu. Also great animation, I love the way eyes and faces in general are drawn. Lastly, really good (and cute) opening and ending sequence. \\n\\n\r\nDon't get confused by the genre tags. They're lying to you. Watch the first episode and decide yourself, whether you like it or not.\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the better slice of lifes I watched in recent past. 1/1 (me) would recommend).\\n",

            "content": "Dagashi Kashi is a really simple and easy to follow anime. Main plot is about Hotaru convincing Kokonotsu to take over the family candy shop. And almost 95% of this plot is about candy. Every episode explains literary everything about one or two particular candies but in a fun way. \r\nOther than candy and some really good humor there is also well-placed hinted romance. But it\u2019s more about friendship and young people planning their future. The characters are also well-made, interesting and fun to watch. I\u2019m not a big fan of main female characters because they\u2019re often poorly done but Hotaru is really special. Hercandy obsession never stops to amaze me. Downside is that you\u2019ll probably get bored because every episode is similar so even if you skip a few, it\u2019s no big deal. And it definitely doesn\u2019t look like shounen anime to me. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you\u2019re interested in japanese candies and you\u2019re looking for some good comedy with no particular storyline this one I for you. \\n",

            "content": "\"Wanna try and be like adults?\"\r\nApart from the fun and sweet (pun intended) nature of Dagashi Kashi, in all my reviews, this has been the hardest review ever as there's lots that conflicts with your mind and the fact that how much you enjoy it is severely hindered by the focus on Japan and it's sweets, something Westerners won't understand.\r\nDe!\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nIt starts off excellently, it made me think that it's gonna be some Ecchi anime with a dash of romance included but boy was I wrong. Instead, it turned out to be a slice of life comedy with a huge focus on sweets particularly Japanesesweets and their origin. The middle part is the reason for it's mediocre rating, it's just too difficult for Western audiences to delve into the show and understand each and every reference and it. This anime was one of those cases of an anime \"Made by a Japanese Studio for a Japanese Audience\" and sadly unlike other reference-heavy anime like Gintama this can't be maneuvered by a simple Translator's Note... That aside, what made up for it is the easy pace and thankfully worthwhile ending. Though the ending is not exactly giving closure a second season is coming up on Jan 12th next year and so this ending makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nDe!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMade by feel. I was a bit surprised at the attractive artstyle of Dagashi Kashi because their previous works felt kinda average for me. Kiss x Sis, Mayo Chiki, last year's Konobi, the ever popular (and imo slightly disappointing) SNAFU Season 2 along with this year's Tsukigakirei are all examples of anime that looked very average in their artstyle. But out of all these, Dagashi Kashi felt a tad better. Character designs were more colorful with a lot of focus on the face, backgrounds looked better, and the list went on. These all made me feel as if Dagashi Kashi is one of the best looking anime made by feel. and so even if it doesn't have the best of stories by feel. animated anime it certainly looks great.\\n\\n\r\nDe!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP/ED were really catchy and both perfectly showed the message of the anime clearly. Though yet again I preferred the ED over the OP (this has been going on for the past few reviews I've done, the ED just feels better than the OP). Now obviously one may appeal over the other for you (or none at all) but I can tell you this much that both were fun to watch and were animated nicely as well. The BGM however, even I with a great memory of BGM couldn't find it memorable at all. It felt bland and totally forgettable... Otherwise it was great.\\n\\n\r\nDe!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI marvelled at how they made a female MC so amazing YET she doesn't fall in love with the male MC as it happens in most similar anime of its kind (but then there's a season 2 so who knows?). Who am I talking about? Hotaru of course! She wasn't just your fanservice character, she was unique. No wonder she was the face of the anime. She loved sweets, she loved them so much that I can kind of understand why there's no romance yet. Upbeat, cheerful, and outright wierd, Hotaru had it all. Definitely my 2nd favorite Purple-Haired girl. On the other side we have Coconut- I mean Kokonotsu. He as well as Hotaru is a refreshing character in the way that he isn't some hopeless creature who doesn't have any aim and still gets all the girls. He has his motivations for being a manga-writer, he has his reasons to refuse the post of succeeding his eccentric Ramune-loving Dad at the Sweet Shop. What makes him so much fun as a character is that he's quite relatable as a character. For the supporting cast we have Saya and Tou, who do a very good job as support. The former got more screentime and development but the latter had an important part to play as well. I am quite surprised at how such a small cast of around 5-6 characters pulled it off, but well done.\\n\\n\r\nDe!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was a treat (pun intended) watching Dagashi Kashi. Since I'm on a slice of life binge right now, I came across it when looking for the upcoming Winter 2018 anime where I noticed season 2 listed there and got intrigued (NOT by Hotaru mind you, I-I w-wont get attracted to a show because of that b-baka!) and gave the first season a shot (of non-alcoholic Beer) and enjoyed it. I would have loved if there was a focus on Romance as well but I'll look to the positive side and hope that the second season has some much-needed romance and I assure you, if there IS romance it's score will be ahead of the first season's. The slice of life aspect was nicely done and I liked the characters and their design as well. Overall I'm hyped for season 2!\\n\\n\r\nDe!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.2 (Averaged)\\n\\n\r\nComedy, sweets, infotainment Dagashi Kashi had it all. It blended all these things perfectly and unlike Hotaru's medicine is sure to make you feel better and happy once you finish the series. An underrated gem, Dagashi Kashi is a must-watch for all Slice of Life fan, comedy fans and of course fans of Ramune-loving I mean Japanese sweets! Here's to a wonderful series and here's to a hopefully better season 2 as well!\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Why the \"De!\"s? It's obviously a reference.\\n\\n\r\nP.P.S: Now this is quite obvious but Hotaru best girl <3",

            "content": "Dagashi Kashi is a \"sweet\" series. The series centres around a boy known as kokonutsu. His father tells him one day that he has to run a small shop which is his families legacy. Kokonutsu does not really want to run the store and is left to look after it. Suddenly, an insane purple haired girl who was the main reason people watched the series appears. Her name is Hotaru Shidare. She is one of the main characters. Hotaru is the daughter of a business owner for the famous Shidare Dagashi corporation. She had been sent to retrieve Kokonutsus father to get him to jointhe Shidare corporation. We find out that Hotaru has a real sweet tooth, knowing pretty much anything needed to know about candy. We get to meet the 2 other main characters after Hotaru gets Kokonutsu to make a delicious new umaibo mixture. These 2 characters are the twins Says and Tou. Says runs a cafe and Tou kind of just sits there but is a likeable character. Saya is a timid, cute girl. She makes people think there's going to be a love rivalry between Hotaru and Saya but there isn't. The series serves as a way to sell Dagashi (candy). It's quite a good way to advertise something because you know a lot of people will watch it. \\n\r\nNow going on from all that description, here's the actual review.\\n\r\nDagashi Kashi as I said is a sweet series. The characters are enjoyable, the soundtrack is good, the art is good and it's quite enjoyable.\\n\r\nDespite that there are a few problems with the series. \\n\r\nFirst of all, there is no story to it really making the series a bit repetitive at times. The pacing of the series I didn't really like. \\n\r\nThere just small problems but the one true problem lies in the dub. The sub doesn't really have that much problems with the script but the dub has some really cringe worthy moments and I mean really cringe worthy moments.\\n\r\nIf you can look past them sorts of things you might enjoy this series. Many people seem to have kind of underestimated it, mostly stopping at episode 7. I swear it gets a bit better after that. I recommend it to people who don't mind many advertisements and like a sweet, chilled, relaxing series.",

            "content": "This anime is criminally underrated here, probably because it has every qualities to get a low score on myanimelist. (episodic manner, non-plot-heavy, fan-services, mysterious Japanese snacks and commercial-ish) It is not the type of anime that everyone would like, but I am glad that I never trust the score of MAL and believe in my intuition when I picking up anime. \r\nFor the story, as a Slice of Life anime, it never intends to tell a story. Plot almost doesn't exist to begin with. Therefore it is kind of irrelevant and unfair to judge the value of this anime with its plot.  \r\nFor theart and sounds, snacks look delicious. Eyes are unique. OP and ED are catchy. The voice acting is great. Hotaru is voiced by Taketatsu Ayana, who is a very polished voice actor. other characters are also voiced by experienced voice actors. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: It has a very small cast of only 5 people. All 5 of them are fun to watch. No complains.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The most important aspect of an anime is always the enjoyment. This anime can be thoroughly enjoyable, can be terrible. It really depends on what types of viewer you are.\\n\\n\r\n1. Fan-services: This anime has a moderate amount of it which make the it overall more fun to watch, so it's good news for me. What's better is that they didn't overdone it, snacks and talks are still the major appeal of this show. \\n\\n\r\n2. Sense of humour: If you like the following things, you will like this anime.\\n\r\n-Innuendos: This anime has a lots of Innuendos, they are like the refined form of fan-services, and are even more exciting than flashing boobs.\\n\r\n-''Ridiculous humour'': Hotaru is a ridiculous character, it is an enjoyment to watch Hotaru talking and acting over-the-top about snacks.\\n\r\n-Parody: The parody are the core of this anime, mostly in two forms:\\n\r\n1. characters acting so serious over some silliy competition\\n\r\n2. anthropomorphic snacks having some little drama\\n\\n\r\n3. Nostalgia\\n\r\nIt's really a personal factor. I don't know the situation overseas, but Japanese snacks like Babystar, Umaibou and Morinaga milk candy are very accessible in Hong Kong. Of course not all of them are available in local snacks store, but even when they are not available, we always can have their China counterpart (counterfeit). I don't know how to describe the feeling when they talk about my childhood snacks. Maybe it's like meeting my childhood friends? I really don't know, but I thoroughly enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall it is a 9 out of 10 for me. I am really disappointed to see this anime is not loved here, but I mean different audience have different tastes, it is what it is. Some may call it a snack commercial. I believe it is, I even prepare some Dagashi to eat while watching the last few episodes. Therefore it is a successful commercial anime. Can't wait to watch season 2.",

            "content": "Dagashi Kashi blipped onto my radar this past winter after I happened upon a promotional image for the second season. I thought the character designs looked pretty interesting, so I decided to give the series a try. In doing so, I ended up learning more about Japanese snack culture than I ever thought possible.\r\nThe series offers up your typical assortment of Shounen-style humor through a uniquely informational slice-of-life narrative. Normally unremarkable tasks such as talking, playing cards, and eating candy are intensified through use of visual metaphor and convincing voice acting. What makes Dagashi Kashi different, though, is its episodic template in which the firsthalf of each episode almost always includes a dramatized lecture about a snack food of some kind, and the second half focuses moreso on our characters\u2019 thoughts and feelings. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a line that goes something like \u201c\u2026the significance of a dagashi shop. Not only is it a place for relaxation, but also a place where bonds are created by interacting customers. It\u2019s a place that creates connections among people.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis line represents the very essence of Dagashi Kashi. While the first season moves along at a pretty slow pace, it develops connections\u00ac between the characters themselves, and also between the characters and the audience. Season two then molds those relationships into something truly entertaining. Together, they combine for a subtly sweet mix of slice-of-life storytelling coated in educational opportunity, then sprinkled with just enough drama to keep it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR If yr gonna watch, it, watch both seasons. The first makes the second one much more worthwhile.",

            "content": "Dagashi Kashi is basically a show featuring different kinds of Japanese snacks and candies along with light-hearted comedy and some fanservice.\r\nThe plot line about his father wanting him to succeed the candy shop so that he could work in Hotaru's company made little importance to the show (the last 2 eps}, so the anime has almost no story and are focused more on the snacks, candies, and gags.\r\nThe characters are good. Hotaru is quite an interesting ball of energy and weirdness along with Kokonotsu's father and are balanced by the more normal (but not boring) Kokonotsu and Saya. Tou, Kokonotsu's best friend, was the guyin between, a little weird and a little normal. So all in all, the characters are almost perfectly corresponding to each other and made this show comical and amusing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing, but what caught my attention were their eyes, while in numerous anime these days where the eyes are largish, Dagashi Kashi did the opposite, which is what pulled me into watching it in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say this is good, if you are the type who wants a good laugh. Personally, this is my weekly source of entertainment when it was still ongoing and I was always looking forward to it.",

            "content": "Candy has never been this delicious hasn't it...right Hotaru?.\r\nThis anime is a slice of life comedy through and through from it's setting of a rural town to the local candy store which is the setting for most of the anime screentime. The comedy like it's \"slice of life\" genre has simple yet some fanservicey punchlines from the minimal cast however even with 5 main cast members, their chemistry together makes the comedy all the more entertaining and relatable. \r\nAlthough the comedy revolves around traditional Japanese candy that may deter or confuse some people, it still has substance in comedy and relatablity. Candy has always beena kind of food you could actually have fun with, savour the flavour and best of all, nostalgia, thus it \"just being a Japanese candy, I won't get it\"...isn't much of an excuse...we've all had childhood where we had candy and this anime only reinforces that through comedic timing and characters.\\n\\n\r\n There are a bit of referential humor from the \"product placement\" mascots of the Japanese candy (where that actually might deter you but considering that this anime gives some history to these candy at the very least they do that so you CAN be in the loop) and really the humor can go either way, either you'll see it blatant product placement or if the comedic timing is right, can be a good laugh, really what LA is saying is that the referential humor can be a hit or a miss. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the characters, Kokonotsu does have \"dense male protagonist\" syndrome however he does \"know what he likes\" but is too shy about it, that person being Hotaru who invigorates the anime and comedy with her eccentric skits and candy-addiction and she too is rather dense in the romance department only because she's just utterly obsessed with candy AND trying to get Kokonotsu to take the mantle for his father's shop. Saya Endou voiced by ''Manami Numakura'' and her brother Tou Endou voiced by ''Tatsuhisa Suzuki'' are Kokonotsu's childhood friends, with Saya having a tsundere crush over Kokonotsu with Tou giving that shipping for those two. Finally You comes in here and there but he's usually loafing around or trying to intact a plan along with Hotaru to get Kokonotsu to be the owner of his shop. These 5 characters do have their other quirks and running gags used in differing ways to produced some decent comedy through their chemistry together with some satisfaction in terms of timing and setting. LA's favourite character?...it was a tie between Hotaru and Saya however over time LA sided with Saya, ohh and these characters do develop over time, but you might be saying that for a slice of life comedy?, what do they develop?, well they grow as characters through their relationships and comedic banter with one another, especially Hotaru as we know the least about her with candy being both the core focus as well as setting for development. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Studio feel, as eccentric to plain as the character designs are, they exceeded in terms of backgrounding and referential effects, thus the animation by feel is by all means decent enough. The ending is one with no resolution to the major plotlines from the love triangle to Kokonotsu becoming the owner of the candy shop...your gonna be slightly angry by this, but considering this anime adaptation is still from an ongoing manga, LA was kinda expecting this thus the \"slightly angry\" statement. \\n\\n\r\nDagashi Kashi may look like a \"blatant advertisement for traditional Japanese candy\", but it definitely has something more than that, LA is gonna be slightly cheesy here but it does have heart in it's characters for their enthusiasm and love of candy, it may not be thee best comedy of Winter 2016 (as that honor goes to ''Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!''), but for a slice of life, relaxing comedy with candy and one eccentric girl in it's skits, it definitely caters to that.",

            "content": "Well this is my first review and I'm writing this because I thought that many people rated it too low.\r\nAbout the story, it was pretty okay. You have a bunch of teens living in the countryside and doing the usual stuff. They sometimes go to the \"dagashi\" shop and talk about the origin of the sweets they eat. There is not much more to it. So, if you like deep anime with a serious plot, this is not it. It's more a \"product\" anime that you watch for your own enjoyment or to kill some time.\r\nAbout the art, I'm sorry, I am no expert andmy opinions on it usually are pretty subjective, so I just gonna say that it looks polished and the animation is pretty nice. I didn't notice too much lazy tricks or any awful drawings.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound doens't have a lot of imporance. The opening was nice and the ending was funny. Ambient music was inmersive for me. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the characters, I found them the best part of this anime because they are funny and likeable. You have 2 girls and 2 guys. The girls just hang around talking about love, life and that kind of stuff. The guys look at the girls and want to be popular,which is quite hard in a village like the one they live in. But I really liked their development, because you get to see how are they in their daily lives and what they do. Basically, they are \"real\" people.\\n\\n\r\nI rated it 10 in enjoyment because I like this kind of animes and enjoyed the humor and stories about candy origins.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, yes, it may be kind of an advertisement for japanese candy but it is worth watching just because it has a peaceful atmosphere and lots of funny jokes.\\n\\n\r\nSorry if this is a bad review or it has lots of mistakes. I just wanted to give my opinion on this anime because I really liked it and thought there were too much reviews that positioned it in a bad place. \\n\r\nI really think it deserves a shot if you like relaxed anime about everyday life with no significant plot.\\n\r\nI found it similar to Non Non Biyori or Barakamon, so if you liked those, definitely give it a try.\\n\r\nThanks for reading this. Feel free to point out my mistakes. (And sorry for the grammar, english is not my native language so I may have made some mistakes)",

I can only conclude, with this morally challenging question of \"story,\" and how it was. Well, my fellow cartoon consumer, it's trash. Zippity zap, bing bong, fling flop flip. Just know that this is not a cartoon where the story isn't the main focus: it's the snacks.\r\nArt 8:\r\nThe art is what is should be, and I would assume it stays true to how the author wanted it to look like. They have managed to use actual, real life,not drawn by hand, images of the snacks to give us some real eye candy for when we buy snacks off otakumode.com(tm)* see the link below.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7:\\n\r\nI like it. Nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9:\\n\r\nThey chose the \"few pew pew\" option and went with choosing a small set of great characters. You'll love these characters, they were worked on very well. The MC isn't that bad either, at least he can take hints sometimes (and sometimes those hints mean overstepping his boundaries).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8:\\n\r\nGood. Very good. So much so that once I receive my paycheck I'm going to go out and buy a Dagashi Kashi themed onahole.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8:\\n\r\nSure it has some flaws (the story), but it is something worth watching. Episode 11, you'll find the most boring. It has a gag though that'll put that to rest. You won't die without watching it, but it's a good watch if you're bored.",

Because nothing worthwhile didn't happen. Heroic deals - not for you, supernatural things always happens in other countries, apocalypse was canceled. All what you do: just went outdoor, met your friends, walk nearby with silly thoughts and do dummy things. You can't write about it, it was fun for you, not for anybody else. \r\nAnd \"Dagashi Kashi\" isexactly about this kind of summer. It set of short stories about teenagers (Kokonotsu, Hotaru, Saya and Tou) who doing nothing special. Hotaru with hers perverted on sweets mind, all time finds some game to play.

Tou is just a dude, who thinking about boobs and how to become popular, and Saya looking at this zoo with curiosity and try to understand, what sense in all of this.\\n\\n\r\nBut there is no sense, it just fun, good and so nostalgic to do dummy things, without any hint on moral.

This show started off as a curiosity to me- it was charming in its simplistic, unassuming stance- as nonthreatening as an anime can possibly be. Yet at the same time, the early episodes had some really strange happenings that I can only describe as \"Japan\". This novelty was endearing for a while, and with the backdrop of the candy store- I though this show could be a fun little niche thing for a while, but the novelty soon wore thin. The beginning was amusing, but then quickly fell into a plodding middle- especially given that Dagashi Kashi shows its hand very quickly, and then continues to play the same cards, in a sense. It picked up again around the ending, promising a little more in the way of romantic subplots, but like most shows of one cour in length- ends up going absolutely nowhere. \\n\\n\r\nThis show features one of, if not THE smallest cast I've ever seen in an anime. 5 characters- and one of them appears in maybe two episodes. There are RARELY even unnamed passers by in this show- it focuses solely on the main 4: Kokonotsu, Hotaru, Saya, and To. \\n\r\nKokonotsu is our put upon protagonist- charged with running his absentee dad's candy shop (which apparently is famous, yet has no other customers besides mostly Hotaru, but also Saya and To). He flip flops between being white dwarf-level dense and a go-getter, but ultimately settles for being another trope-guy. \\n\r\nHotaru is a rich heir to a prominent candy manufacturing family, whose airheaded-ness is surpassed by only her obsession with eating candy. So much so, that she even frequently hallucinates that she is talking to, making out with, or otherwise in 'actual' love with candy. She a freak, though. \\n\r\nSaya and To are twins, and the best friends (and possibly only other people in town?) of Kokonotsu. To is the typical good natured perv friend, and Saya happens to be a master of everything she attempts (our perfect human being character), except the ways of love. \\n\\n\r\nOne last thing of note is the artwork. The overall design is very minimalistic, but one specific part of the character designs will stick with me- the eyes. The characters in this show have some of the strangest eyes I've ever seen. Hotaru has spirals instead of pupils, and most of the other characters have extremely beady eyes or look incredibly sleep deprived. It adds another odd element to an oddity of a show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is about as interesting as vanilla ice cream- but if learning the names of a bunch of Japanese candy and getting a sales pitch in animated form is exciting to you- by all means, give it a spin.",

            "content": "So Kokonotsu... do you wanna try becoming adults?\r\nSay yes you beta bastard, say yes!\r\nAnyways, Dagashi Kashi! This series was the one I was most interested in before it aired. Why? Because of that busty babe on the picture! And now, after watching it, I can confidently say that Dagashi Kashi was actually the complete opposite of what I thought it would be. I thought it was going to be a story about young Kokonotsu, an aspiring mangaka, and his struggles of dealing with Hotaru, that sweet sexy thang, who wants Kokonotsu to take over his dad's candy shop instead! Well, sure... that's kind of whatthe show is about. But is it really?\\n\\n\r\nNah.........\\n\\n\r\nDagashi Kashi is a textbook example of a \"nothing happens\" show. However, it isn't by any means boring! It isn't like Glasslip tier of nothing happens, it's more of like the things that do happen are borderline irrelevant to any sort of \"plot\" this show tries to tell.\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention \"plot?\" Well, I take it back, for there is none. Dagashi Kashi purely consists of skits and character interactions. As entertaining as some of these skits are, they really don't add up to become some amazing story. Quite the opposite, actually, for they don't add up at all! They are all their own little equations.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now most of you guys reading this review must wonder why I still give it a 7, and that is because Dagashi Kashi is by no means a bad show! In fact, it was one of the more enjoyable ones this season! Sure, since a lot of the jokes are about Japanese candy, and not a lot of you people are Japanese, you might think the jokes are incredibly hit or miss. But the extremely colorful and dynamic characters more than makes up for it! Dagashi Kashi is definitely an enjoyment > quality type of anime.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Great characters! They are all really characteristic and fun, and none of them are hateable.\\n\r\n- Very catchy OP and ED!\\n\r\n- I really like the character designs!\\n\r\n- Character interactions are very humorous.\\n\r\n- Surprisingly good use of flashbacks!\\n\r\n- There's romantic tension? What....\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Less story than Musaigen.\\n\r\n- While the character interactions are spot on, the jokes themselves are very hit or miss. For most caucasians, you won't find most, if any of the jokes funny. I'm Chinese, and Chinese candies are close enough. (Not really.)\\n\r\n- No memorable OST.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nBut Yuni, there is no story? Why not a 1? Well, that's because the events that actually do happen within this \"story\" are actually pretty entertaining! Each skit is usually about a type of candy or some event based around candy. It's a story that focuses A LOT on first world problems. And these first world problems are like ridiculous ones. Whatever happens depends on the candy. Sometimes it's a history lesson about why that candy exists. Sometimes it's some competition that connects to the candy. Sometimes it's a flash back of a memory that was triggered by the candy. These events range from boring, to educational, to entertaining. But at the end of the day, the characters are the same, the plot hasn't progressed whatsoever, and yeah. NOTHING HAPPENS!!!!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is great, although nothing noteworthy or overly impressive. I do like the character designs though! This show does have a pretty unique and interesting character design, and I think it fits the characters well, especially Hotaru, who's character design makes her look both mature (BOOBIES) and childish. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nOP and ED are incredibly catchy! Other than that, sound is average. OST is there but you won't remember it, and the seiyuus do a good job expressing their characters!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nArguably the best aspect of this series, the characters of Dagashi Kashi are just so enjoyable! Their characteristics aren't the most unique, but they are just so colorful and hilarious! Hotaru's little antics and habits are really funny and you can just see the innocence just seep out of her. Saya is your typical flat tsundere, but she still has so much character to the point that she became my favorite character of the series. Also, the interactions between kid Saya and kid Kokonotsu during flashbacks were just adorable. Tou also has a lot of personality, and of course, Kokonotsu's dad is just hilarious! Kokonotsu himself is pretty generic, but he has his moments as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nDagashi Kashi was actually really fun to watch for the most part! Whenever it got entertaining, it got REALLY entertaining. However, there were parts where it got pretty boring, but the entertaining parts completely overshadow the boring ones!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nDagashi Kashi is actually a pretty good show! It's light hearted and has no serious moments in it whatsoever, and is pretty much there just for fun. If you go in, don't expect any plot. But you may get some nice \"plot\" if you know what I mean ;)\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Boob ice cream? Take my money.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE!\r\nMany people argue that Dagashi Kashi is nothing more than one big advertisement for Dagashi. This may or may not be true. Perhaps if you are Japanese and had grown up on Dagashi, this series is probably so slice-of-life that it\u2019s boring. As someone genuinely interested in the lifestyles of Japanese citizens beyond anime and pop culture, I found this anime quite educational! Not only had I never heard of Dagashi before watching episode 1, but it also gave me a look into Japanese childhood, and growing up in the Japanese countryside. I also love the silly characters, especially Hotaru. Ifyou are interested in Japanese culture as a whole, and you enjoy your light-hearted series\u2019, then Dagashi Kashi is for you! It helps that I\u2019m also a bit of a foodie.\\n\\n\r\nI was rather confused by the final episode, which almost completely lacked closure. Are they leaving an opening for a second season, or did they really just not know how to wrap up this anime?",

            "content": "Tl;dr 4.4 out of 10. no oppai, no plot, lots of talking about snacks.\r\nThis show starts completely different than it actually is. We start with a young aspiring manga artist who works in his dad's rural snack shop. It's a boring little shop with few customers. One day a pretty girl walks in and announces she's someone important and then goes on to challenge the main character in some snack themed contest and then does it again and again and again and so on.\r\nThe story pretty much derails after the first two episodes and falls into a formulaic feedback loop:\r\nStart of episode: boring snack shop.\\n\r\npart 1: introduce some mundane problem that a character acts like it's the end of the world (think first world problems). \\n\r\npart 2: somehow this has to do with a snack (no, really it doesn't). \\n\r\npart 3: the history and other random useless facts on said treat (boring). \\n\r\npart 4: some sort of bet is made (which they never actually do, no matter who wins).\\n\r\npart 5: a contest that usually doesn't make sense takes place (only part where something happens).\\n\r\npart 6: win or lose or don't complete the contest. nothing ever comes out of this.\\n\r\npart 7: the episode ends.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much it. This is especially odd since the first ep looks like this might have a bit of ecchi theme to it which is followed by some semblance of a plot and a promise of some high jinks, however that is the only episode that offers any of those things.\\n\\n\r\nIn the background there's an interesting slow developing love triangle with the two female characters and the main character. I really wish the story would have focused on that more as it is kind of interesting. The two pretty girls have good traits and the main character is likable but the show all but abandons them to play out a history lesson on snacks that you never knew existed, assuming you're not from Japan. I'd still wager that even if you are from Japan and/or you do know all of these snacks, you'll care just as little.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nOverall 4.4/10",

            "content": "At the time of writing this review, I have dropped this anime, with no plans to ever return and finish the remaining five episodes. This anime is boring. It is basically a Japanese candy commercial in anime form. Each episode is typically divided into two parts, with each part focusing on a different candy. There is also a weird crazy girl that knows too much about candy, and she is usually the one that introduces the candy of the episode. \r\nThe plot of this anime is relatively simple: Kokonotsu wants to be a manga artist, but his father wants him to take over the familybusiness: a candy store. Hotaru wants Kokonotsu's father to work for her family's candy company, and he agrees as long as she is able to convince Kokonotsu to take over the store. This makes Hotaru begin to harass Kokonotsu about candy all the time and allows the anime to become a Japanese candy commercial. Honestly, I had forgotten about the premise of the series because they hardly ever mention it again in favor of talking about candy all the time (can you tell how annoyed I am that I was roped into watching an anime that is literally just about candy?). \\n\r\nThe one redeeming quality of this anime is Saya. The episodes, or parts of episodes, that focus on her really stand out for me, but sadly weird crazy girl (Hotaru) gets most if the focus of the anime. I suppose if you want to learn more about Japanese candy you might find some enjoyment in this show. Being a foreigner with absolutely no previous knowledge of any of these candies led me to being either confused or bored at most of the content, and I couldn't justify finishing the series if I was just forcing myself to sit through it. 3/10\\n",

            "content": "Dagashi Kashi is for me the rare show that turned out to be different from what I expected, in a wholly positive way. No fanservice or wish fulfilment going on here, just unabashed dagashi nerdiness and fun slice of life.\r\nThe premise is simple: An energetic girl comes to a town out in the countryside and tries to encourage our protagonist, Coconuts, to take over his father's dagashi shop. The story is full of nice people, the characters are pretty much all likeable and behave naturally throughout the show. I find Coconut's father, You(his mom's name must be \"Me\") to be an especially fun character, heis really energetic and caring, the kind of father you hardly get in anime these days.\\n\\n\r\nYou have to be prepared though, the show throws a lot of facts at you which can get repetitive. Each episode is divided into segments that talk about individual snacks, which are chock full of history and small quirks about each specific dagashi. It helps to have a bit of knowledge about the kinds of sweets there are available in Japan, but for me I never felt lost, even when the jokes didn't hit there was usually something to learn.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does however have a bit of a slow start. The character Tou comes off as pretty mean in the first episode but gets a lot more enjoyable through the course of the show. Some of the sound effects are pretty stock, and Studio Feel's animation doesn't flow very well at points, but these are minor issues in the show. If you're a sucker for anything related to history or Japan I'd say you'd take to this show very well, there's a lot going on in Dagashi Kashi even though it might not be the most complex show out there. Its smart and uplifting, the kind of show that will never fail to brighten up your day.",

            "content": "Watching Dagashi Kashi feels nostalgic. It\u2019s nostalgic in the sense that makes you feel like a little kid again. Remember the first time you\u2019ve walked into a candy store and picked out your favorite sweets? It\u2019s that type of familiar feeling. Dagashi Kashi evokes a bit of childhood memories when I walked into a candy store for the first time. And believe me, this show likes to do a lot of funny things related to candy.\r\nThe series follows the episodic adventures of Kokonotsu Shikada. His encounter with Hotaru Shidare lands him in stories that drops him into the world of dagashi. Why? It\u2019s because Hotaruis part of a famous family owned sweet company. She wants Kokonotsu\u2019s father to join and he only agrees on the condition that Kokonotsu can take over his own shop. Thus, we got Hotaru and her ever daring tactics to get Kokonotsu for taking the shop. \\n\\n\r\nFirst thing to get out of the way: A good portion of the show relies heavily on comedy. It sells comedy through advertising of the dagashi. Hotaru is pretty much the mascot girl as she tries to appeal the wonderfulness of dagashi. From simple explanations, innovative lectures, or expressive dialogues, Hotaru is actually pretty good at convincing. Plus, she has the look (or \u201cit\u201d factor) to sell her product. The way this show is set up is that each episode has Hotaru trying ways to win Kokonotsu or others over with her convincing. Her personality is rather eccentric and overly dramatic whenever it involves candy. A good example is when she gets a mouth ulcer but still desperately wants to taste candy like in a ritualistic manner. Throughout the show, Hotaru also shows a vast knowledge about candy. The way she tries to convince others is rather overdramatic including getting others to play strange games or activities. So in retrospect, this is the type of show with little emphasis on plot but more on selling its premise.\\n\\n\r\nWith a small character cast, the show gives a decent amount of screen time for almost all of them. Kokonotsu (or as some of his friends call him \u201cCoconuts\u201d), is perhaps the most normal of the main cast. He is friendly, casual, and often tries to help others although remains oblivious to certain characters\u2019 feeling around him. This includes Saya, a girl that has obvious affections for him. Through his interactions with Hotaru, it seems like if he\u2019s developed an affection the titular character. In the meantime, there\u2019s Saya\u2019s brother Tou, who actually knows about his sister\u2019s crush on Kokonotsu. The only person that doesn\u2019t seem to know is Kokonotsu himself. And finally, we got Kokonotsu\u2019s father, You Shikada. Unlike his son, You\u2019s personality seems more similar to Hotaru with his hyperactive energy. The entire show focuses on these characters and the world of candy. When you have a diverse range character cast like this, it makes you wonder how the show can build around itself. The obvious answer is through character chemistry. Every episode may focus on candy but it also puts a bit of emphasis on character connections. Kokonotsu learns a lot from Hotaru, Saya grows closer to Kokonotsu throughout the show, and Hotaru also develops a friendly relationship with Saya. The show presents the character relationships in a comedic style rather than dramatic. In other words, don\u2019t expect actual love angles to develop as this series is about much more than a romance story. The only thing Hotaru has in mind seems to be candy while Kokonotsu remains dense as a neutron star about Saya. The family relationships (Kokonotsu/You and Saya/Tou) seems pretty typical and nothing out of extraordinary; the type you can expect between real life family members. But in essence, the show is down-right more of a comedic story.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there\u2019s some controversy with the way the series is adapted. For whatever reason, certain content is omitted from the manga about Hotaru and replaced by Saya. The show started with overemphasis on Hotaru\u2019s presence but in later episodes seems to also expose Saya a great amount of screen time. This seems controversial as it derives from the faithfulness of the adaptation and also gives Hotaru less relevance. Because let\u2019s be honest here, who here originally came to the series to watch for Saya? Hotaru is the main poster girl. In the meantime, the comedy of the show can be a mixed bag at times. It never actually changes despite each episode involving different scenarios, games, or whatever tactic Hotaru tries to convince others about candy. This also comes with a negative of characterization as background storytelling (with perhaps the exception of Saya) is largely absent. In essence, the show is really more of just popcorn fun to pass time at times.\\n\\n\r\nStudio feel helms the adaptation and thankfully provides good enough quality for the characters, backgrounds, and overall presentation. It has a countryside feel as the entire show never really ventures too far away from the candy store. However, the most noticeable part of the series is character design. Or rather I should say, one name. Hotaru Shidare. She has exotic looking eyes with ripple-pattern like rings in her iris. Combine that with a bit of lilac hair and you got quite a unique looking girl. Saya\u2019s eyes on the other hand looks rather simple and she dresses more casually than Hotaru. Oh and of course the show likes to take advantage of Hotaru\u2019s appearance so expect a bit of fan service; mostly subtle and satire by the comedic parodies.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and music goes hand in hand for the show. The OP song evolves throughout the first three episodes until we get a good glimpse of the style. While I can\u2019t say the music is very impressive, it does fit quite well for the show \u2013 being lighthearted and dramatic at time when it needs to be. However, the voice mannerism is what really sells the product with Hotaru yet again being the star. Her over-eccentric voice combined with personality is hard to ignore to be quite honest. Similarly, You is also ever energetic enough to be in the spotlight whenever his son seems to be indifferent about his life.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time this show is over, I feel like eating candy. No, it\u2019s not because Hotaru convinced me but that the show itself just seems to have too much fun to not jump into it. At the same time, the character cast is there to sell its comedy whether it works or not. As with any comedic series, the humor really needs to be exciting and Dagashi Kashi got that right in the palm of its hands.\\n",

Yet I'm still surprised how low is the show rated here on MAL.\r\nInstead of pointing out pros and cons, let me comment on some aspects that people complain about.\r\n\"The show is advertising Japanese sweets.\". I mean... it is called *Dagashi* (sweets) Kashi, so the talk about sweets and their history is to be expected, isn't it?  \r\nEven the synopsis says, quoting: \"...And so begins Hotaru's mission to *enlighten* the boy on the true joy of delicious and nostalgic dagashi!\" \r\nThenwhy is it so surprising, that the characters often discuss facts about candy? It isn't. That's exactly what I expected and what I got. Facts about sweets. Often pretty interesting at that and occasionally humorous, too. \\n\r\n\"The show is not that funny.\" Yeah, probably because it isn't meant to be funny. I don't understand why is it marked as comedy / shounen here on MAL, when it is neither of that, it's a slice of life more than anything. It's supposed to make you smile, maybe giggle a little bit, but don't expect to laugh out loud.\\n\r\n\"It's repetitive.\" Like I said, it's a slice of life. Life is repetitive. What do. Live on.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I'm done ranting, let me just say that I genuinely enjoyed it. I mean the show, not life. \\n\r\nHighlights? Characters are great, Saya is the best waifu. Also great animation, I love the way eyes and faces in general are drawn. Lastly, really good (and cute) opening and ending sequence. \\n\\n\r\nDon't get confused by the genre tags. They're lying to you. Watch the first episode and decide yourself, whether you like it or not.\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the better slice of lifes I watched in recent past. 1/1 (me) would recommend).\\n",

            "content": "Dagashi Kashi is a really simple and easy to follow anime. Main plot is about Hotaru convincing Kokonotsu to take over the family candy shop. And almost 95% of this plot is about candy. Every episode explains literary everything about one or two particular candies but in a fun way. \r\nOther than candy and some really good humor there is also well-placed hinted romance. But it\u2019s more about friendship and young people planning their future. The characters are also well-made, interesting and fun to watch. I\u2019m not a big fan of main female characters because they\u2019re often poorly done but Hotaru is really special. Hercandy obsession never stops to amaze me. Downside is that you\u2019ll probably get bored because every episode is similar so even if you skip a few, it\u2019s no big deal. And it definitely doesn\u2019t look like shounen anime to me. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you\u2019re interested in japanese candies and you\u2019re looking for some good comedy with no particular storyline this one I for you. \\n",

            "content": "\"Wanna try and be like adults?\"\r\nApart from the fun and sweet (pun intended) nature of Dagashi Kashi, in all my reviews, this has been the hardest review ever as there's lots that conflicts with your mind and the fact that how much you enjoy it is severely hindered by the focus on Japan and it's sweets, something Westerners won't understand.\r\nDe!\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nIt starts off excellently, it made me think that it's gonna be some Ecchi anime with a dash of romance included but boy was I wrong. Instead, it turned out to be a slice of life comedy with a huge focus on sweets particularly Japanesesweets and their origin. The middle part is the reason for it's mediocre rating, it's just too difficult for Western audiences to delve into the show and understand each and every reference and it. This anime was one of those cases of an anime \"Made by a Japanese Studio for a Japanese Audience\" and sadly unlike other reference-heavy anime like Gintama this can't be maneuvered by a simple Translator's Note... That aside, what made up for it is the easy pace and thankfully worthwhile ending. Though the ending is not exactly giving closure a second season is coming up on Jan 12th next year and so this ending makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nDe!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMade by feel. I was a bit surprised at the attractive artstyle of Dagashi Kashi because their previous works felt kinda average for me. Kiss x Sis, Mayo Chiki, last year's Konobi, the ever popular (and imo slightly disappointing) SNAFU Season 2 along with this year's Tsukigakirei are all examples of anime that looked very average in their artstyle. But out of all these, Dagashi Kashi felt a tad better. Character designs were more colorful with a lot of focus on the face, backgrounds looked better, and the list went on. These all made me feel as if Dagashi Kashi is one of the best looking anime made by feel. and so even if it doesn't have the best of stories by feel. animated anime it certainly looks great.\\n\\n\r\nDe!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP/ED were really catchy and both perfectly showed the message of the anime clearly. Though yet again I preferred the ED over the OP (this has been going on for the past few reviews I've done, the ED just feels better than the OP). Now obviously one may appeal over the other for you (or none at all) but I can tell you this much that both were fun to watch and were animated nicely as well. The BGM however, even I with a great memory of BGM couldn't find it memorable at all. It felt bland and totally forgettable... Otherwise it was great.\\n\\n\r\nDe!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI marvelled at how they made a female MC so amazing YET she doesn't fall in love with the male MC as it happens in most similar anime of its kind (but then there's a season 2 so who knows?). Who am I talking about? Hotaru of course! She wasn't just your fanservice character, she was unique. No wonder she was the face of the anime. She loved sweets, she loved them so much that I can kind of understand why there's no romance yet. Upbeat, cheerful, and outright wierd, Hotaru had it all. Definitely my 2nd favorite Purple-Haired girl. On the other side we have Coconut- I mean Kokonotsu. He as well as Hotaru is a refreshing character in the way that he isn't some hopeless creature who doesn't have any aim and still gets all the girls. He has his motivations for being a manga-writer, he has his reasons to refuse the post of succeeding his eccentric Ramune-loving Dad at the Sweet Shop. What makes him so much fun as a character is that he's quite relatable as a character. For the supporting cast we have Saya and Tou, who do a very good job as support. The former got more screentime and development but the latter had an important part to play as well. I am quite surprised at how such a small cast of around 5-6 characters pulled it off, but well done.\\n\\n\r\nDe!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was a treat (pun intended) watching Dagashi Kashi. Since I'm on a slice of life binge right now, I came across it when looking for the upcoming Winter 2018 anime where I noticed season 2 listed there and got intrigued (NOT by Hotaru mind you, I-I w-wont get attracted to a show because of that b-baka!) and gave the first season a shot (of non-alcoholic Beer) and enjoyed it. I would have loved if there was a focus on Romance as well but I'll look to the positive side and hope that the second season has some much-needed romance and I assure you, if there IS romance it's score will be ahead of the first season's. The slice of life aspect was nicely done and I liked the characters and their design as well. Overall I'm hyped for season 2!\\n\\n\r\nDe!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.2 (Averaged)\\n\\n\r\nComedy, sweets, infotainment Dagashi Kashi had it all. It blended all these things perfectly and unlike Hotaru's medicine is sure to make you feel better and happy once you finish the series. An underrated gem, Dagashi Kashi is a must-watch for all Slice of Life fan, comedy fans and of course fans of Ramune-loving I mean Japanese sweets! Here's to a wonderful series and here's to a hopefully better season 2 as well!\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Why the \"De!\"s? It's obviously a reference.\\n\\n\r\nP.P.S: Now this is quite obvious but Hotaru best girl <3",

            "content": "Dagashi Kashi is a \"sweet\" series. The series centres around a boy known as kokonutsu. His father tells him one day that he has to run a small shop which is his families legacy. Kokonutsu does not really want to run the store and is left to look after it. Suddenly, an insane purple haired girl who was the main reason people watched the series appears. Her name is Hotaru Shidare. She is one of the main characters. Hotaru is the daughter of a business owner for the famous Shidare Dagashi corporation. She had been sent to retrieve Kokonutsus father to get him to jointhe Shidare corporation. We find out that Hotaru has a real sweet tooth, knowing pretty much anything needed to know about candy. We get to meet the 2 other main characters after Hotaru gets Kokonutsu to make a delicious new umaibo mixture. These 2 characters are the twins Says and Tou. Says runs a cafe and Tou kind of just sits there but is a likeable character. Saya is a timid, cute girl. She makes people think there's going to be a love rivalry between Hotaru and Saya but there isn't. The series serves as a way to sell Dagashi (candy). It's quite a good way to advertise something because you know a lot of people will watch it. \\n\r\nNow going on from all that description, here's the actual review.\\n\r\nDagashi Kashi as I said is a sweet series. The characters are enjoyable, the soundtrack is good, the art is good and it's quite enjoyable.\\n\r\nDespite that there are a few problems with the series. \\n\r\nFirst of all, there is no story to it really making the series a bit repetitive at times. The pacing of the series I didn't really like. \\n\r\nThere just small problems but the one true problem lies in the dub. The sub doesn't really have that much problems with the script but the dub has some really cringe worthy moments and I mean really cringe worthy moments.\\n\r\nIf you can look past them sorts of things you might enjoy this series. Many people seem to have kind of underestimated it, mostly stopping at episode 7. I swear it gets a bit better after that. I recommend it to people who don't mind many advertisements and like a sweet, chilled, relaxing series.",

            "content": "This anime is criminally underrated here, probably because it has every qualities to get a low score on myanimelist. (episodic manner, non-plot-heavy, fan-services, mysterious Japanese snacks and commercial-ish) It is not the type of anime that everyone would like, but I am glad that I never trust the score of MAL and believe in my intuition when I picking up anime. \r\nFor the story, as a Slice of Life anime, it never intends to tell a story. Plot almost doesn't exist to begin with. Therefore it is kind of irrelevant and unfair to judge the value of this anime with its plot.  \r\nFor theart and sounds, snacks look delicious. Eyes are unique. OP and ED are catchy. The voice acting is great. Hotaru is voiced by Taketatsu Ayana, who is a very polished voice actor. other characters are also voiced by experienced voice actors. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: It has a very small cast of only 5 people. All 5 of them are fun to watch. No complains.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The most important aspect of an anime is always the enjoyment. This anime can be thoroughly enjoyable, can be terrible. It really depends on what types of viewer you are.\\n\\n\r\n1. Fan-services: This anime has a moderate amount of it which make the it overall more fun to watch, so it's good news for me. What's better is that they didn't overdone it, snacks and talks are still the major appeal of this show. \\n\\n\r\n2. Sense of humour: If you like the following things, you will like this anime.\\n\r\n-Innuendos: This anime has a lots of Innuendos, they are like the refined form of fan-services, and are even more exciting than flashing boobs.\\n\r\n-''Ridiculous humour'': Hotaru is a ridiculous character, it is an enjoyment to watch Hotaru talking and acting over-the-top about snacks.\\n\r\n-Parody: The parody are the core of this anime, mostly in two forms:\\n\r\n1. characters acting so serious over some silliy competition\\n\r\n2. anthropomorphic snacks having some little drama\\n\\n\r\n3. Nostalgia\\n\r\nIt's really a personal factor. I don't know the situation overseas, but Japanese snacks like Babystar, Umaibou and Morinaga milk candy are very accessible in Hong Kong. Of course not all of them are available in local snacks store, but even when they are not available, we always can have their China counterpart (counterfeit). I don't know how to describe the feeling when they talk about my childhood snacks. Maybe it's like meeting my childhood friends? I really don't know, but I thoroughly enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall it is a 9 out of 10 for me. I am really disappointed to see this anime is not loved here, but I mean different audience have different tastes, it is what it is. Some may call it a snack commercial. I believe it is, I even prepare some Dagashi to eat while watching the last few episodes. Therefore it is a successful commercial anime. Can't wait to watch season 2.",

            "content": "Dagashi Kashi blipped onto my radar this past winter after I happened upon a promotional image for the second season. I thought the character designs looked pretty interesting, so I decided to give the series a try. In doing so, I ended up learning more about Japanese snack culture than I ever thought possible.\r\nThe series offers up your typical assortment of Shounen-style humor through a uniquely informational slice-of-life narrative. Normally unremarkable tasks such as talking, playing cards, and eating candy are intensified through use of visual metaphor and convincing voice acting. What makes Dagashi Kashi different, though, is its episodic template in which the firsthalf of each episode almost always includes a dramatized lecture about a snack food of some kind, and the second half focuses moreso on our characters\u2019 thoughts and feelings. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a line that goes something like \u201c\u2026the significance of a dagashi shop. Not only is it a place for relaxation, but also a place where bonds are created by interacting customers. It\u2019s a place that creates connections among people.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis line represents the very essence of Dagashi Kashi. While the first season moves along at a pretty slow pace, it develops connections\u00ac between the characters themselves, and also between the characters and the audience. Season two then molds those relationships into something truly entertaining. Together, they combine for a subtly sweet mix of slice-of-life storytelling coated in educational opportunity, then sprinkled with just enough drama to keep it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR If yr gonna watch, it, watch both seasons. The first makes the second one much more worthwhile.",

Hotaru is quite an interesting ball of energy and weirdness along with Kokonotsu's father and are balanced by the more normal (but not boring) Kokonotsu and Saya. Tou, Kokonotsu's best friend, was the guyin between, a little weird and a little normal. So all in all, the characters are almost perfectly corresponding to each other and made this show comical and amusing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing, but what caught my attention were their eyes, while in numerous anime these days where the eyes are largish, Dagashi Kashi did the opposite, which is what pulled me into watching it in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say this is good, if you are the type who wants a good laugh. Personally, this is my weekly source of entertainment when it was still ongoing and I was always looking forward to it.",

            "content": "Candy has never been this delicious hasn't it...right Hotaru?.\r\nThis anime is a slice of life comedy through and through from it's setting of a rural town to the local candy store which is the setting for most of the anime screentime. The comedy like it's \"slice of life\" genre has simple yet some fanservicey punchlines from the minimal cast however even with 5 main cast members, their chemistry together makes the comedy all the more entertaining and relatable. \r\nAlthough the comedy revolves around traditional Japanese candy that may deter or confuse some people, it still has substance in comedy and relatablity. Candy has always beena kind of food you could actually have fun with, savour the flavour and best of all, nostalgia, thus it \"just being a Japanese candy, I won't get it\"...isn't much of an excuse...we've all had childhood where we had candy and this anime only reinforces that through comedic timing and characters.\\n\\n\r\n There are a bit of referential humor from the \"product placement\" mascots of the Japanese candy (where that actually might deter you but considering that this anime gives some history to these candy at the very least they do that so you CAN be in the loop) and really the humor can go either way, either you'll see it blatant product placement or if the comedic timing is right, can be a good laugh, really what LA is saying is that the referential humor can be a hit or a miss. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the characters, Kokonotsu does have \"dense male protagonist\" syndrome however he does \"know what he likes\" but is too shy about it, that person being Hotaru who invigorates the anime and comedy with her eccentric skits and candy-addiction and she too is rather dense in the romance department only because she's just utterly obsessed with candy AND trying to get Kokonotsu to take the mantle for his father's shop. Saya Endou voiced by ''Manami Numakura'' and her brother Tou Endou voiced by ''Tatsuhisa Suzuki'' are Kokonotsu's childhood friends, with Saya having a tsundere crush over Kokonotsu with Tou giving that shipping for those two. Finally You comes in here and there but he's usually loafing around or trying to intact a plan along with Hotaru to get Kokonotsu to be the owner of his shop. These 5 characters do have their other quirks and running gags used in differing ways to produced some decent comedy through their chemistry together with some satisfaction in terms of timing and setting. LA's favourite character?...it was a tie between Hotaru and Saya however over time LA sided with Saya, ohh and these characters do develop over time, but you might be saying that for a slice of life comedy?, what do they develop?, well they grow as characters through their relationships and comedic banter with one another, especially Hotaru as we know the least about her with candy being both the core focus as well as setting for development. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Studio feel, as eccentric to plain as the character designs are, they exceeded in terms of backgrounding and referential effects, thus the animation by feel is by all means decent enough. The ending is one with no resolution to the major plotlines from the love triangle to Kokonotsu becoming the owner of the candy shop...your gonna be slightly angry by this, but considering this anime adaptation is still from an ongoing manga, LA was kinda expecting this thus the \"slightly angry\" statement. \\n\\n\r\nDagashi Kashi may look like a \"blatant advertisement for traditional Japanese candy\", but it definitely has something more than that, LA is gonna be slightly cheesy here but it does have heart in it's characters for their enthusiasm and love of candy, it may not be thee best comedy of Winter 2016 (as that honor goes to ''Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!''), but for a slice of life, relaxing comedy with candy and one eccentric girl in it's skits, it definitely caters to that.",

            "content": "Well this is my first review and I'm writing this because I thought that many people rated it too low.\r\nAbout the story, it was pretty okay. You have a bunch of teens living in the countryside and doing the usual stuff. They sometimes go to the \"dagashi\" shop and talk about the origin of the sweets they eat. There is not much more to it. So, if you like deep anime with a serious plot, this is not it. It's more a \"product\" anime that you watch for your own enjoyment or to kill some time.\r\nAbout the art, I'm sorry, I am no expert andmy opinions on it usually are pretty subjective, so I just gonna say that it looks polished and the animation is pretty nice. I didn't notice too much lazy tricks or any awful drawings.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound doens't have a lot of imporance. The opening was nice and the ending was funny. Ambient music was inmersive for me. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the characters, I found them the best part of this anime because they are funny and likeable. You have 2 girls and 2 guys. The girls just hang around talking about love, life and that kind of stuff. The guys look at the girls and want to be popular,which is quite hard in a village like the one they live in. But I really liked their development, because you get to see how are they in their daily lives and what they do. Basically, they are \"real\" people.\\n\\n\r\nI rated it 10 in enjoyment because I like this kind of animes and enjoyed the humor and stories about candy origins.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, yes, it may be kind of an advertisement for japanese candy but it is worth watching just because it has a peaceful atmosphere and lots of funny jokes.\\n\\n\r\nSorry if this is a bad review or it has lots of mistakes. I just wanted to give my opinion on this anime because I really liked it and thought there were too much reviews that positioned it in a bad place. \\n\r\nI really think it deserves a shot if you like relaxed anime about everyday life with no significant plot.\\n\r\nI found it similar to Non Non Biyori or Barakamon, so if you liked those, definitely give it a try.\\n\r\nThanks for reading this. Feel free to point out my mistakes. (And sorry for the grammar, english is not my native language so I may have made some mistakes)",

I can only conclude, with this morally challenging question of \"story,\" and how it was. Well, my fellow cartoon consumer, it's trash. Zippity zap, bing bong, fling flop flip. Just know that this is not a cartoon where the story isn't the main focus: it's the snacks.\r\nArt 8:\r\nThe art is what is should be, and I would assume it stays true to how the author wanted it to look like. They have managed to use actual, real life,not drawn by hand, images of the snacks to give us some real eye candy for when we buy snacks off otakumode.com(tm)* see the link below.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7:\\n\r\nI like it. Nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9:\\n\r\nThey chose the \"few pew pew\" option and went with choosing a small set of great characters. You'll love these characters, they were worked on very well. The MC isn't that bad either, at least he can take hints sometimes (and sometimes those hints mean overstepping his boundaries).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8:\\n\r\nGood. Very good. So much so that once I receive my paycheck I'm going to go out and buy a Dagashi Kashi themed onahole.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8:\\n\r\nSure it has some flaws (the story), but it is something worth watching. Episode 11, you'll find the most boring. It has a gag though that'll put that to rest. You won't die without watching it, but it's a good watch if you're bored.",

Because nothing worthwhile didn't happen. Heroic deals - not for you, supernatural things always happens in other countries, apocalypse was canceled. All what you do: just went outdoor, met your friends, walk nearby with silly thoughts and do dummy things. You can't write about it, it was fun for you, not for anybody else. \r\nAnd \"Dagashi Kashi\" isexactly about this kind of summer. It set of short stories about teenagers (Kokonotsu, Hotaru, Saya and Tou) who doing nothing special. Hotaru with hers perverted on sweets mind, all time finds some game to play. Kokonotsu, because of none more important job to do, join her. Tou is just a dude, who thinking about boobs and how to become popular, and Saya looking at this zoo with curiosity and try to understand, what sense in all of this.\\n\\n\r\nBut there is no sense, it just fun, good and so nostalgic to do dummy things, without any hint on moral.

            "content": "[SHIGERU MIYAMOTO SPONSORS THIS SPOILER ALERT BANNER]\r\nIt's all about a mangaka teen who's father wants him to take over his dagashi store (think London corner shop) called Kokonotsu. A while later he meets a girl who looks exactly like the one from his manga, except this one has a sweet tooth for anything Japanese and edible (or non-edible, for that matter), and an extremely inappropriate sense of humour (which is what we all like) which derives from the fact that she doesn't really know where the boundaries stand or the concept of an innuendo. And then shit happens for 12 episodes.\r\n[STORY]\r\nThe whole of the mainstory (mostly spoiler-free) is in the first paragraph. Besides that, Dagashi Kashi is more like a 12-episode, 23 minute commercial for various Japanese sweet companies. Each episode is laid in the format that \"Kokonotsu does something related to some random-ass sweet, Hotaru finds out and realises, she spends an eternity lecturing him on the sweet's history and intricate details no-one but \"tru dagashi fanatiks\" care about.\". Despite this, I found the story interesting as I could learn about various Japanese sweets, and I got to see more of Best Girl Saya and Big Boobs Hotaru.\\n\\n\r\n[ART]\\n\r\nEverything in the show is actually surprisingly well drawn, although the artist's style of drawing eyes is wildly weird for me (weird circles instead of an iris and pupil), although I believe this fits the style of the rest. Dagashi Kashi's animation is actually pulled off pretty well, and flawed only by slight marks of dullness and not much variety or showcasing of it's limits.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND]\\n\r\nThe voice acting is well done (even in the dub) and both the OP and ED songs are catchy enough for me to remember them long after DK's finished airing. There's not much to talk about here, but I will also remark that the sound effects used with in are also of a high quality and good use in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n+1 point for \"Huge Heavies Hotaru\" : a fun and humorous but also dagashi-educated purple-haired weirdo\\n\r\n+200 points for Best Girl Saya : sharp-minded, sharp-tongued, and sharp-toothed, what's not to love about this mini-tsundere wrapped in a StarRamyunBucks apron?\\n\r\n+1 point for the mangaka trope which is still good\\n\r\n+1 point for the not that funny guy who thinks he's funny, Endou\\n\r\n+999 points for the YouTuber dad who fails at everything he does\\n\r\nThe characters are well fleshed-out and have interesting backstories (besides Hotaru, which we don't know much about), and behave in a way realistic of those who would be placed in the same situation in real life.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching approximately 10,560 seconds of what seemed to be a Japanese snacks commercial, surprisingly. I'd really want to see what happens between Kokonotsu and Saya, as we all know that it's meant to be.\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\nA commercial worth paying for. Dagashi Kashi was a good watch, and I'd recommend it to someone interested in Japanese culture.\\n\\n\r\nRated \"W\" for \"Wanna become adults?\".",

            "content": "With a sweet story and deliciously hilarious comedy, Dagashi Kashi has to be my personal favorite of the Winter 2016 season.\r\nWhat\u2019s great about the plot is how simplistic it is: conversations about traditional Japanese snacks (referred to as \u201cdagashi\u201d) in a rural setting. That is pretty much all there is. However, it\u2019s how this is executed that makes it great. Also, fun fact: the dagashi mentioned in the show are the real product, so there is even accuracy to it.\r\nThe other great aspect about the show is the characters. Ever get tired of shows that have this massive list of characters that it makes ithard to comprehend? Well, Dagashi Kashi can fix that, because their cast only consists of five characters. Since we follow only these five that we get this strong connection with them; all of them work together perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nI like to believe that the animation from Feel helps give a distinguished look. There have been other works from the studio that I particularly didn\u2019t enjoy, but this is an exception. When there are any close ups of the characters, I love how detailed everything is.\\n\\n\r\nThis series was one I was highly anticipating for the season. Hearing about it, I promptly read the manga, and feel in love in an instant. The one thing that concerned me was how the anime was going to adapt it, considered the format of the manga. However, though there were some liberations, I feel the anime did a pretty good job.\\n\\n\r\nI would highly recommend this series if you love comedy and the fun facts about Japanese history (though be it only about candy).",

            "content": "I feel like this series is more of an advertisement for a Japanese candy rather than an actual show trying to present a plot.....\r\n[Story]: (2/10)\r\nKokonotsu's father owns a candy shop on a small rural countryside town. One day, a girl appeared and she tried to recruit his father to work for her company. He refused and so did Kokonotsu. Hotaru then decides to stay to try and convince Kokonotsu to work for her company. \r\nI have no idea why I decided to enter this show with expectations. The first episode was really interesting and I thought it was going to go somewhere. Even if theplot was going somewhere like a garbage, I'd rather have that than 12 episodes of pure advertisement for a candy. That's literally the whole show. Every single episode, Hotaru brings in a new candy or she randomly picks one of the candies in Kokonotsu's Father's Dagashi shop and then she explains the whole candy for you. The concept, how it's made, where it came from, what it tastes like, how you should eat it and etc. But wait there's more, Hotaru is not the only character who talks about candies. Every character in the show talks about candies. \\n\\n\r\nI just explained the whole show for you so I have no more idea what to talk about..Oh that's right, the comedy and the fan-service. What I'm going to talk about right now is going to be purely subjective since not everyone found the show to be funny. I actually found this show a bit funny and it made me chuckle through the run. For example, Hotaru's crazy-ass personality made me laugh sometimes and Kokonotsu and Endou being desperate at whatever also made me laugh.  I also noticed that some people found this show boring. For me, I only found the show boring at the first half. At the second half, I just, for whatever reason, enjoyed the remaining episodes. Maybe because I watched the show in English Dub or maybe I got used to watching a 24 minute candy commercial every week.\\n\\n\r\nJust by looking at the cover, you'll know at first's glance the character who's going to be subjected to fanservice. Yep, that's Hotaru. The show is going to be playing with her extremely large breasts in almost every episode so strap on if you want to see candy crumbs falling on her breasts or if you want to see a Slimey/Watery white candy (I forget what it was called) exploding on her face. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nThe Art and the Character Design looks pretty average. It's what you'd expect from a Slice of Life show except I won't call this a Sol show since it's not labeled in the Genre tags. This show is created by Studio feel, the studio behind My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU TOO and I honestly would have preferred if the character designs were almost the same as SNAFU TOO because the art in that show is feel's best work and this feels like half-assed. The animation is pretty good, though I wasn't expecting much since this show is just about candies. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (7/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is....forgettable. Nothing really stood out and nothing attracted my attention. It was just a bunch of plain ass boring soundtracks. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Checkmate?!\" by MICHI and \"Hey! Calorie Queen\" by Ayana Taketatsu. For a show about freaking candies, the Opening Animation didn't really make much sense... There was Star Wars-like segments feauturing  Kokonotsu and some random guy that looked like Darth Vader, an Indiana Jones-like segments, characters flying in paper warplanes...you get what I'm trying to say. The OP theme song on the other hand is pretty average and it's somewhat catchy. The ED theme song is also average and the only reason why I would watch it is to watch the post-credit scene. You could say that I could have easily skipped the ED to watch the post-credit scene but.....it is what it is.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (6.5/10)\\n\r\nThe only highlights of this god-forsaken 24 minutes candy commercial is Hotaru. The rest of the characters are mediocre (Kokonotsu and Tou) to decent (Saya). Now to talk about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nHotaru is an innocent, candy loving girl who knows pretty much about every Dagashi out there in Japan. Like I said above, she's the highlights of this show. She's like the only interesting character in the show and is the only reason why I came back every week. She's also one of the reasons why the show is hilarious. Her personality, her innocent \"act\" that can be easily taken out of context, and the way she eats her candies freaking killed me. For example, there was one scene in the show where she was eating and chocking on a long and large candy. If you take a deeper look at the scene, the show makes it look like she's chocking on a large penis but it's just a giant and long pink candy. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the rest of the characters. Kokonotsu, Tou and Saya. Kokonotsu is a manga artist who lives in a Dagashi shop with his father and has to deal with Hotaru's crazy antics ever since she came into her shop. He's a mediocre character, that's all I gotta say. He's a bland and boring main character but the reason why he's not a forgettable character is because the show's character roster is super small. Then there's Tou, he's your typical perverted male character who likes to chase girls. I do like the chemistry between Kokonotsu and Tou which makes me like their characters at times. Then finally there's Saya, the only decent character in the series, just under Hotaru. What makes her interesting is her personality and she's also a \"tsundere\", my number one favourite character archetype.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (7/10)\\n\r\nWho said I can't enjoy a 24 minutes candy commercial? There are times where I found the show to be quite boring but most of the time, I did enjoy the show and it was a fun ride. Though, I won't be missing this show so good riddance.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nDespite \"Dagashi Kashi\" having a weak-ass plot, the characters, especially Hotaru, does make the show interesting to watch. I did learn something while watching this show. First is the meaning of \"Dagashi\" and second is the amount and the variety of dagashi out there in Japan which makes me want to try them out. If you love candies sooo much then this is a show for you but if you're looking for a regular slice-of-life then I guess this is an ok show but I won't be bringing my expectations up if I were you because there are a lot more slice-of-life shows out there that takes place in a rural Japan and is 100 times better than this show. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (7/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Entertaining show if you don't have any expectations\\n\r\n+Interesting characters\\n\r\n+Great Animation\\n\r\n+The show's comedy is hilarious at times\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Candies, Candies, and a whole lot more Candies\\n\r\n-Forgettable Soundtrack\\n\r\n-A very weak slice-of-life when compared to other slice-of-life shows with similar settings but without the candies.",

            "content": "Soooo, an anime with a rural sweet shop as its main stage? Sure why not, seems harmless enough. And harmless it is: I discovered this via another website that was showing off a cosplayer's talents and ended up looking up the anime and eventually watching it (although I won't deny that one of the main heroin's \"plot\" played a large part in this).\r\nThe first episode was enough to get me hooked, and my innate curiosity for all forms of weird and wonderful culinary creations helped a lot with that (thank you Roald Dahl), so overall I found the premise and informative tidbits about the sweetsquite enjoyable really (although, that really is the main topic of this anime, maybe a bit too much so in fact).\\n\r\nThe characters and artwork are all excellent, even though there are only basically four main characters: the aspiring mangaka protagonist who doesn't want to take over his dad's sweet shop, his flat-chested and somewhat overpowered childhood friend who secretly loves him, her brother the nice, slightly overconfident and perverted \"guide\" (not really sure how to describe him, it's always the same kind of guy in these \"romance\" comedies), and the buxom heiress to a sweet company for whom the MC has a (kinda) crush on (or maybe it's just straight up lust, it seems a bit more like that frankly).\\n\r\nSo there's humor, the OP childhood friend beats them all at these childhood games, a few flashbacks, a love triangle that doesn't really go anywhere and a huuuge amount of anecdotes related to sweets. It's all very nice (if not a bit boring from time to time), but the story just kind of gives up and dies at some point in the last few episodes, which seem to build up to (at least) a moderately impressive (if not maybe predictable) firework style ending, and then the last episode just pops, fizzes, smokes a little and splutters not very convincingly like a wet and rather small firecracker. \\n\r\nWhich is a shame really, because that kind of thing tends to dampen your spirits and leave you thinking: \"right..Well that was a bit of a cock-up wasn't it?\"\\n\r\nOverall, I'd rate it 6-7: it's fun, I personally enjoyed it, but definitely don't watch it if you're not interested in sweets, want an interesting story or 24 minutes of the buxom heroin's chest (because they only focus on it twice and you can hardly see her bra through a transparent-whit T-Shirt).\\n\r\nThere is oppai ice-cream though, so that's something I feel might be lacking in Occidental sweet-shops.",

            "content": "Now don't let the low rating of this candy filled show turn you away. I think a lot of people should give this show a chance and here's why.\r\nThe number one thing that got me hyped for this show was it's incredible and unique art style. Just looking at Hotaru (girl with the purple hair) on the cover made me know the aesthetic is going to be amazing, which it was. And the story also sounded very promising too.\r\nStory 5: In a nutshell, Hotaru Shidare is here to convince Kokonotsu to take over his fathers candy store which is a family business. She introduces Kokonotsuto many different wonders of dagashi (candy) and we learn many different things from this. Buuuut, that's not a very good storyline and can seem rather bland. However, the show manages to keep this entertaining! It's crazy with a story like this kept me waiting each week for the next episode to come out. \\n\\n\r\nThe main problem I had with the show/storyline is it's constant use of promoting. You can now buy candy seen from the show, doesn't that seem like their intention all along? just to make these candy companies more profit. It had me wondering why I was watching it in the first place however, I did like their use of candy such as using them for episode titles. Though it still seemed like Hotaru was actually trying to say \"buy this!\" and \"this dagashi is also great!\" whilst constantly throwing dagashi right at the screen. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10: The art is beautiful, wacky unique with a wide range of bright colours and darker colours. Each character had memorable designs which I know I'll never forget! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9: Ah Hotaru and Saya...two lovely female characters. We have crazy candy loving Hotaru whilst we have bitter-sweat coffee shop owner Saya. Kokontsus character was..okay? his personality didn't really have anything different too it which isn't so bad for this anime since we already have Hotaru. However, I still think he could have been more exited over the fact that he gets to be with stunning Hotaru for most of his free time. There wasn't a lot of character development which we missed out on unfortunately. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: It's actually really interesting to learn about different traditional Japanese candy in each episode. Each candy has a different story, told in the most wackiest way possible. Although, sometimes it can be a little frustrating just hearing about candy all the time when we could hear more about these funny characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9: I think this show is something I would recommend to a lot of people, especially those who like stupid comedy and want something different in an anime. Enjoyable but also has problems which can ruin the show massively for some people.",

Turns out you can make an anime out of almost anything. The story revolves around japanese snacks, also known as \"dagashi.\" From the first episode, it had an interesting aura around it, telling you that it wasn't gonna be a stereotypical anime. There was virtually no plot for the whole season, just a piece of sort-of-plot thrown in there known as \"I must get Kokonotsu to inheirit the dagashi shop!\" However, the anime itself didn't hit on this point for most of theepisodes and it wasn't really a big part of the anime, just a lame excuse to put some characters somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all this, I found the anime actually very enjoyable. The silliness of it and the interaction between characters was quite endearing, and it somehow drew me in before I knew it. The whole anime was just eye candy, no plot but still very enjoyable, like Nichijou or Daily Lives of Highschool Boys.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would have to say this is a mainly comedy anime with many fun points to check out, and it's great for people who are looking for something light and quick to watch.",

            "content": "Dagashi Kashi is quite a unique anime to come out in recent times. You may have seen a lot of monster of the week or villain of the week anime, but how many candy of the week anime have you seen. I sure haven\u2019t seen any! The premise is quite interesting, as it\u2019s fun to learn about candy, or referred to as dagashi in the series. The dagashi talk is fun and all, but the series leaves me wanting more from the series. The characters are interesting and it would have been nice to go in-depth with them. And the fact that the series feelsaimless didn\u2019t help either. Still, Dagashi Kashi gets its job done. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe story focuses on Kokonotsu, a wannabe mangaka who works with his dad in maintaining their dagashi shop. One day a girl named Hotaru comes to their shop, wanting Kokonotsu\u2019s to join their dagashi manufacturing company. This can only be possible is Kokonotsu decide to take over the shop after his father leaves. What first started out as a story about a girl trying to force a boy to take care of his shop, turned out to be a competition between the two to find out who\u2019s more knowledgeable in dagashi. Every episodes gives us comedic situations revolving around dagashi and how the characters react and act in these situation. In every episode, we learn more about these dagashi candies and it\u2019s really fun. There\u2019s no real overarching story here. It won\u2019t take long for you to forget about Kokonatsu\u2019s dream to be a mangaka, or why Hotaru\u2019s here in the first place. It would\u2019ve been nice if more focus was given to these plot points. But the episodes revolving around dagashi are pretty entertaining, even if the content is a hit or miss. \\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nFirst of all, as I mentioned before, Dagashi Kashi has an episodic structure. Actually, for most of the times there\u2019s more than one situation in each episode. Many of these stories don\u2019t connect much with one another besides the characters. The overall main plot, which was mentioned fore, is just used as a frame, to hold all these episodes together. Every episode you get to learn more about dagashi and its really fun. The anime does a great job to teach you new stuff in a more interesting way than reading off a textbook. The anime then uses these dagashi to make a comedic moment. This showcases the creativity in the series is great, as it manages to make a moment out of these dagashi. Dagashi heavily relies on its comedy too get you attention and entertain. If a moment lacks comedy, it doesn\u2019t feel very good. And unfortunately the content here is a hit or miss, though it\u2019s mostly a hit. And the content can get a little too repetitive at times. But still, the style it goes for is great, and it does what it wants to achieve. \\n\r\nPresentation: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nThe characters in Dagashi Kashi are quite good. A lot of them are very entertaining. First we have our main protagonist Kokonotsu, and the best this about him is his name. He\u2019s an okay protagonist, nothing too special, but some of his reactions are pretty funny. Then you have Hotaru, a wacky, dim-minded, yet knowledgeable in dagashi girl, who\u2019s conversations can become unintentionally lewd. She\u2019s easily the most entertaining character in the anime and her love for dagashi never fails to impress me. Her being used as fanservice is a little bit annoying at times. Saya\u2019s another entertaining character in this anime. Her tsundere-ish character isn\u2019t actually annoying, but more refreshing. Here reactions to certain situations, and her OP-ness in luck-based games, are always impressive. Tou\u2019s also pretty funny and an underused character. Also Kokonotsu\u2019s just adds to the wackiness! The bunch of characters are really fun and its really entertaining seeing them react to certain situations. Though none of them get any development that adds depth to them, but for a strictly comedy series, its fine if the development is lacking. \\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nDagashi Kashi\u2019s art style is a pretty unique one. By looking at the key visuals, it wouldn\u2019t take much to notice that the character designs, particularly the face designs are pretty unique. Now whether these designs are good or bad is subjective, as it depends on one\u2019s taste. Personally, they add a uniqueness and they can add a better comedic effect to some scenes. The eyes on most of the characters are pretty different. Most of the character\u2019s pupils are tiny and it makes them look cross-eyed at times. Somehow, this just makes some of the comedy scenes feel better (and weirder). Hotaru\u2019s ahegao-looking face just adds to the innuendos and the lewdness. And it also makes people misunderstand her words. The backgrounds in the anime are decent, nothing too special. The detaining isn\u2019t much, but it\u2019s the character designs that shine in Dagashi Kashi. \\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animations in Dagashi Kashi are standard. There\u2019s nothing that shows out to be special. At times, character movements lack the smoothness and fluidity I was hoping for. And the backgrounds do feel a bit to static, but it\u2019s not bad. The anime still looks good and the at style does cover up the animation qualities. And for a slice-of-life comedy, there\u2019s no need for the animations to be fantastic (unless you\u2019re Nichijou that is). Still the animations work well, even if it doesn\u2019t stand out. At least it\u2019s consistent, or else inconsistency (even if its high point if phenomenal) doesn\u2019t look good. \\n\r\nAnimation: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe voice acting is really impressive in Dagashi Kashi, as a lot of them do the comic timing properly. Kokonotsu\u2019s seiyuu, Abe Atsushi, does a standard job. It isn\u2019t anything too special, but it gets the job done. Taketatsu Ayana on the other hand does a fantastic job as Hotaru. She manages to succeed in making Hotaru a zany, weird, and really fun at the same time. She manages to make the character look dumb and smart at the same time. Numakura Manami also does a fairly good job as Saya. It\u2019s not anything too special, but she does justice to the role. Suzuki Tatsuhisa as Tou on the other hand is great! He does a good job making Tou look like a dumb and not too bright guy, while making him likeable. Fujiwara Keiji does Kokonotsu\u2019s dad, You, and he does a fantastic job. Fujiwara is a fantastic seiyuu do it isn\u2019t surprising that he\u2019ll do a great job in this comedic role. Overall, the cast does a great job in voice acting. Some do outshine others though. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music in Dagashi Kashi is really good too. The OP, \u201cCheckmate!?\u201d, is quite the underrated one this season. Personally, I find it really catchy, upbeat, and it totally matches the mood of the series. The vocals aren\u2019t anything to special, but the music used for the OP splendid. The ED, \u201cHey! Calorie Queen\u201d is also really good. Just like the OP, it\u2019s fun and upbeat, and it even matches the anime\u2019s content. The vocals are really good in this ED. The background music used in the anime is pretty decent. It works well during the more comedic scenes, but it doesn\u2019t add too much. The background music doesn\u2019t really stand out much, but it\u2019s decent. \\n\r\nMusic: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nA Part of me feels like I enjoyed Dagashi Kashi more than I should have. Its main plot is unfocused, and the content does get repetitive at times. But I couldn\u2019t get enough of those characters and their silliness. I found myself enjoying seeing them interact with one another. And it was really fun learning about dagashi every week, even though I\u2019m not a big candy fan myself. Also the unique art really does make this anime more intriguing. The silliness and over-the-top-ness makes me grin harder than I should. Some comedy is a miss, some of the reason can be because the jokes may not translate properly. Other than that, Dagashi Kashi has been a fun ride. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Dagashi Kashi does exactly what it needs to do; it has the characters doing wacky things and us learning about dagashi. It doesn\u2019t try to achieve anything more than that, but it\u2019s fine the way it is. With its loveable characters and some really good voice acting, the anime ended up being enjoyable, even if the content started to get repetitive. Dagashi Kashi is a flawed anime no doubt, but it\u2019s fun because it doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. The comedy may a hit or miss for some, but for the most time, it doesn\u2019t miss. Dagashi Kashi is a unique and sweet (pun intended) anime from this season, and it\u2019ll be hard to find something else similar to this. \\n\\n\r\n+ Very enjoyable characters with wacky traits, supported by very good voice acting \\n\r\n+ Unique art and great character/facial designs \\n\r\n+ Teaches us about dagashi using its comedic situations in order to entertain while teaching\\n\r\n+ The comedy is very creative at times, and is over-the-top without being too nonsensical \\n\r\n- Content starts to get repetitive and does feel aimless at times\\n\r\n- The comedy, during some moments, is a hit or miss\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.4/10",

Althrough this anime has something to offer, like: Intro song (very addictive), very nice art, and Hotaru (She is damn cute when she is not talking (about that \"traditional\" japanese candies).

            "content": "Story: it has none. Hotaru shows up in the other characters' village and they spend time being happy normal people with one crazy huge-breasted girl who lives, breathes and loves sweets. I just spoiled the whole show's plot for you, deal with it~\r\nArt: I think the cover speaks for itself. It looks nice, character designs are simple yet come off as quite memorable and in general the animation is doing its job perfectly fine for a simple slice of life.\r\nSound: Honestly love the opening song and in general all the tunes. The sound design is also nothing to scoff at.\r\nCharacters: they're all likeable but Idon't think any of them are anywhere near fantastic. Dagashi Kashi works well because it is carried by its characters interactions and Hotaru's insanity, but if you look at the fine print none of the characters are amazing or even great. Kokonotsu, Saya and To each do a better job than your typical harem protagonist(no this isn't a harem anime), typical childhood lover/friend and typical annoying best friend. There is effort in making them stand out, and they do stand out, as in they're not as lame as most of what you can find, and each of them has personality and charm. It doesn't make them great. I liked all of them and would watch the anime again to see them again, but I will not remember any of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: To be very fair Dagashi Kashi is best enjoyed in small increments. Barfing the 12 episodes in one night would be the worst idea for a simple reason: the whole show relies on its characters and Hotaru's insanity as I said, and there isn't enough material there to fill 12 episodes with interesting content. So instead DK tends to stump around a bit and drag and repeat its architecture again and again. An episode starts, Hotaru will do or say something insane, it'll end up being about a sweet, and we'll have a ton of character interaction and trivia about the sweet. It's a fine system and there's nothing wrong with using it a lot, but DagaKa ONLY uses that, beyond this principle there is no plot and nothing really new ever happens. I think the Festival episode is the only one with something actually different.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I watched Dagashi Kashi in two parts, episode 1 to 7 then episode 8 to 12. I can say for sure that I stopped for a while after 7 simply because I was bored. A boredom which had disappeared by the time I came back to it some weeks later. If I had to state an overall feeling on Dagashi Kashi it would be that among then numerous comedies with commercial goals and plotless slices of life that I've watched, I think it's still on the higher tiers of quality. It's worth watching and it is fun, even if it does get tiring after the jokes have been seen a few too many times. Likeable and interesting characters go a long way, and even if Dagashi Kashi doesn't have much more than that except the obvious erotic undertones constantly thrown around, it's enough to make it enjoyable, if only slightly.",

The story is more or less, just basic slice of life with not much of an ongoing story progression, but that's plenty for me as its really entertaining especially some of the situations Hotaru gets everyone into by insinuating things she doesn't mean without knowing it. Also Snacks, Lots and Lots of Snacks! Episode 1 of this show instantly transported me back to my trip to Japan where I won someUmai-Bou in an arcade game, so I ordered some. \\n\r\nHighly recommended to any fans of comedy or slice of life.",

            "content": "Alright so, I'll break this anime down in just a simple sentence.\r\n\"An anime with no real story-telling, aimless romance between characters, and... is about Dagashi!\"\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story revolves around Shikada Kokonotsu, an aspiring manga artist who stubbornly refuses to inherit the family business- a small-time candy shop, going by the name of Shikada Dagashi. One day, Shidare Hotaru- a dagashi-loving waifu who works in a world famous sweets manufacturer, shows up on their front door, looking to provoke Kokonotsu's oto-san to come back working for her company. He refuses at first, but agrees under one condition: Hotaru will have to convince Kokonotsu to take overthe family business. \\n\r\nAND SO, this becomes the main \"objective\" of the overall anime. But to be really honest, there is no story progression at all. Every episode is completely random, and the situation in each episode is very similar to the every other. Hotaru enlightens Kokonotsu with a new dagashi, so on and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nYeah, not much to say here since I watch all anime in 1080p. The art is probably the greatest thing about the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nDecent but with not many memorable soundtracks at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nAs there isn't much character progression either, the characters aren't really memorable at all. Except for, at most, the main waifu. (totally not because of her overly obese oppai)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nDespite the story, the anime really wraps around its comedy genre. I could see myself laughing in almost every episode, and it really lightens to the mood of the entire anime. Sometimes during an episode, I would ask myself why I'm watching a no-story-progression anime in the first place, and then the comedy kicks in at some point, and I don't regret watching as much anymore. It also educates you in different Japanese sweets!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nThe comedy is great, but the lack of story and character progression really puts the score down the drain. The aimless romance is really annoying at times too, you think it's progressing slowly but in fact- it's not at all.\\n\r\nAT MOST, it's gotta be a 7/10. Anybody who gives it above a 7 is probably just a  weaboo in love with the main overly obese oppai waifu.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there you have it. A mediocre, but fun-to-watch anime. If you want an anime that you don't want to take serious at all, but at the same time have a little laugh and appreciate the art, then this is for you. Otherwise, disregard it.\\n",

            "content": "In this review, I will be going through each core element of the anime, and will share my thoughts as to why I like this anime. Before that, I would like to say that I feel this anime is severely underrated on MAL. This anime is one of the best comedies, and one of the most unique anime I have watched. I would highly recommend this anime to you if you enjoy good, light-hearted comedy, as well as if you like being informed about Japanese snack culture.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThere is almost no plot in this anime, but we will not take it into consideration in thisreview. The main premise of this show is very simple- A girl who tries to convince a boy to take over his family's Japanese snack shop. It is from this main point that lots of interesting scenarios are developed. As I have said above, this show is considered by me to be very unique, because it's main focus is on the \"dagashi\" (Japanese snacks), and it provides us with information about it. The comedy and occasional fan-service tie in nicely with the main storyline.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 9/10 and 9/10\\n\r\nThe art style of this anime is quite to my style, and therefore, I reward it with a high score. I don't pay too much attention to sound, but it is vital in the creation of mood and atmosphere, which is done very well in this anime, upholding the comedic genre.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime might have a small number of characters, but it makes up for it in terms of story and the character's personalities, both of which combine to make the show very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall Impression: 10/10 and 10/10\\n\r\nThe unique premise of the show, along with the good comedy that it comes with, means that I thoroughly enjoy this anime. I have no complaints to make, and will definitely re-watch it, given the chance. \\n\\n\r\nTOTAL SCORE: ~9.50 (Rounded up to 10.0)",

            "content": "Story -6-\r\nThe story of Dagashi Kashi is nothing that is overly thrilling. It is about a young man, Kokonotsu, whose father runs a dagashi shop. Kokonotsu does not want to run the shop, as he has dreams of being a manga artist. However, the daughter of a huge dagashi manufacture, Hotaru, soon shows up, doing her best to try and convince Kokonotsu to take over the shop. This story is nothing special and isn\u2019t something that would normally get anyone too excited. However, there were a few plot points that did make the anime a bit more fun to watch.\r\nThe most enjoyable part of theshow would be when Hotaru or Kokonotsu are explaining where the different dagashi came from and the differences that are made from various companies producing the same candy. I also found much enjoyment in the small side story of the crush that Saya had on Kokonotsu. It was through this little side story romance that the characters managed to develop the most, which made the plot move forward.\\n\\n\r\nArt -7-\\n\r\nThe art style of Dagashi Kashi was rather enjoyable but nothing too impressive. I was personally turned off by the strange hair color from Hotaru, as the rest of the plot was in a rather normal universe. I also enjoyed the few times where they would take the extremes and just run with it into the art style, making some of the characters have incredible facial features and the such.\\n\r\nHowever, that was the most extreme that the show went, as they put minimal effort into the backgrounds and the world was almost entirely bare of any background characters. I think that if they had put some more effort into making the world a bit more realistic, the art would have been much better to look at rather than just solely the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound -6-\\n\r\nThere wasn\u2019t anything too amazing with the sound design. Personally, I find it rather annoying whenever there is background music while characters are talking, but nothing too extreme is happening. Dagashi Kashi does not do this all that often thankfully, but it does keep things light as it is a slice of life anime. The opening and ending songs were both rather nice, however, they never really did fit the feel of the anime.\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the anime was also very nice, each character having a voice that seemed to fit each character. Hotaru was always upbeat and passionate. Kokonotsu appeared to be a bit airy or like he wanted to be doing something else. Saya had the right mix of caring and not caring. If the opening and ending fit the feeling of the anime more, however, the sound would have scored a bit higher.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -8-\\n\r\nI fully enjoyed watching these characters. While there isn\u2019t much of a plot in the whole show, the two most important characters, Saya and Kokonotsu, do seemingly develop throughout the 12 episodes. Saya starts off as someone who just can\u2019t tell Kokonotsu how she feels about him and is happy just to be his friend. However, by the end of the series, she is much more comfortable with expressing her romantic interest in him.\\n\r\nKokonotsu also starts off as rather selfish, only wanting to complete his dream even if it means that he will be leaving a lot of important people behind. After talking to Hotaru and spending the summer with her, along with his friends, he is much more open to the idea of staying in the town and taking on the business. Though he has not given up the idea of being an artist, he is just more open to doing both things. It was fulfilling to watch these characters grow and step out of childhood and become young adults who have real reasonability.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -7-\\n\r\nMost of the enjoyment for me was not in the occasional fan-service. I had a great time learning the history of different Japanese snacks along with seeing Kokonotsu and Saya start to move out of their childhood and into adulthood. When I was learning about the snacks, Hotaru\u2019s passion would catch hold of me, and I would be drawn into the story, and it would make me want to go out and order some of these snacks for myself so I could try them as well.\\n\r\nWhen watching Saya and Kokonotsu start to grow up, it gave me a warm feeling, remembering when I was just starting to step out of my comfort-zone and start to do things that I enjoyed, but was nervous about. They each had a tiny comfort zone and seemed very set in their ways. However, as they came to the realization that they could not stay like that forever, they started to take steps that as an audience, made me happy to see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall -6.8-\\n\r\nOverall, I truly did enjoy Dagashi Kashi, but not for the reasons one might expect. The art was average, and the sound was not as amazing as it could have been. However, where I was waiting for an anime full of fanservice and flat jokes, I found an anime about coming of age and learning. I do not like slice-of-life animes because I get very bored of them rather quickly. It is more of a chore to watch them. With Dagashi Kashi, I did not get that feeling. It has the power to connect with the audience and make them remember those time when they were kids just starting to come to the grips of the world. While there isn\u2019t a solid plot in the anime, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a rather fulfilled feeling at the end.\\n",

            "content": "Dagashi is a story about a girl, who clearly has some mental issues, who for some reason needs to get a candy store owner to join her family's company. Unfortunately, the owner refuses unless his son, our protagonist, agrees to give up his mangaka dreams and inherit the store. At this point, I'm thinking oh wow we have an instant girlfriend series with a candy-based twist. Oh how very wrong I was.\r\nIn actuality Dagashi is a show about candy, all sorts of various candy including regional specialties- oh, and a bit of Ramune. The characters are there just barely more than a story is presentin a hentai- i.e. literally just enough to get you to the next scene er... candy. If you like learning interesting random facts about candy and can stand a story that basically goes nowhere, then Dagashi Kashi is the show for you. If you're looking for something with a bit of romance, character development, or depth, you're looking in the wrong place.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation in Dagashi is definitely unique, you have to look no further than the OP and its rather wild style. The ED's play on Alice in Wonderland is also pretty creative. It isn't a particularly serious show so colors are more vivid than your typical show, and backgrounds aren't particularly important so expect a lot of blurry scenery. That said there is a ton of various candies, which is drawn to a very good level of detail. The character styling is likewise unique in the show. Hotaru has crazy eyes that match her infatuation with candy and for some reason Saya has tiny pupils. Our protagonist Kokonotsu, hereby nicknamed Coconuts, often wears a bored look that, along with his outfit, reminds me of the protagonist from Sankarea.\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn't really have any real action but does have imaginary scenes borrowing some ideas from other shows such as Gundam, and occasionally features various candies as talking characters. There is a bit of light ecchi as the show makes use of Hotaru's generous proportions. It's often a result of Hotaru's lack of self awareness, leading to many bloody noses from the male cast.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music of Dagashi is likewise unique. The show opens with a funky and playful tune; it's fitting though I don't particularly like it. The ED is sung by the VA for Hotaru, it's a likewise playful tune that honestly is a bit more catchy than the OP. The show's uniqueness continues in the BGM, if anything I'd say it has a bit of a Latin flair; some of the songs sound like they'd go well with a tango dance. Though the BGM is more playful than your average show, there are long periods of just conversation, which can still put you to sleep.\\n\\n\r\nThe VAs do a good job considering the specific nature of this show and the rather long sections of nothing but conversation. Ayana Taketatsu gives Hotaru a fittingly overpowering personality, and is pretty much the selling point of the show. Our protagonist is voiced by Atsushi Abe, whose somewhat soft voice reminds me of Touma from the olden days of Index.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nDagashi doesn't really have much of an actual story; it really is just a bunch of episodic content centered on different Japanese snacks. The focus ranges from the well known to the rather obscure regional delicacy. As a person who has spent less than three weeks total in Japan, a lot of the show is rather hard to relate to as I haven't had the pleasure (or horror) of trying some of these snacks. I will happily report, however, that this show doesn't induce hunger attacks like other food-centric shows (such as Gourmet Girl Graffiti).\\n\\n\r\nThe show's premise of crazy-girl Hotaru convincing Coconuts to take over the family shop isn't done in a convincing manner. Her attempts basically boil down to a bunch of challenges that happen to deal with candy, whether it's eating super-sour candy or a tug of war with gummies. Though the challenges are comedic and often bring up random references to other famous anime, one has to question the importance of Coconuts father, given the amount of time and effort Hotaru is spending in a rather rural town. As the story doesn't have an actual central plot, I wouldn't expect much of a climax or conclusion either. Really if you're looking for anything beyond a candy-centric slice of life, this story isn't going to yield much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThere aren't many characters in the show assuming you don't count the candy and occasional mascot. Our protagonist happens to know many random facts about candy and is often found staring at Hotaru's generous bust. He is accompanied by a comedic-relief sidekick named Tou, who is often on the receiving end of violent retribution when he teases his sister Saya, who happens to have a crush on Coconuts. Enter in the well-dressed and energetic Hotaru, who is literally crazy about snacks.\\n\\n\r\nThe show establishes the relationships between the characters early on but then leaves them set for the duration of the show. Though there are some interesting exchanges between the characters, don't expect any plot depth from the relationships. Sorry to harp on this more but seriously, Hotaru is in love with a snack mascot?\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in the intro, this show really isn't about the characters, and it shows in their lack of depth.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThough this may sate the comedic needs for some viewers, I am not in that category. Furthermore, there is virtually zero romance in this show and zero story depth. Yes, there are a lot of candy references that I'm sure will be completely useless to me lest I make another journey to Japan, but that isn't really what I'm watching shows for. It does score some value for being unique in theme, but I just wish the story actually went somewhere. Overall, Dagashi was a fair watch, but way overrated considering the amount of initial hype surrounding it. Perhaps just like the show's topic, Dagashi is good in moderation.",

            "content": "Dagashi Kashi doesn't really feel like an anime per se, more of an advertisement along with a history lesson.\r\nSo the general story is that Hotaru one day appears at Kokonotsu's candy store to persuade You (his father) to join her company, but You will only agree if Kokonotsu takes over the candy store. And... that's pretty much where the story ends because from thenceforth every episode is exploring a different Japanese candy, how delicious they are, and their history, along with some light fan service. So basically, this is like Shokugeki no Souma lite.\r\nIn regards to art and sound they're okay. The art is betterthan average so it's an 8 while the sound is an average of 7. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty stagnant which would've been okay in a slice-of-life but I feel as though there should be a bit more to them. Kokonotsu also has a childhood friend who secretly likes him and for whatever reason she serves, we don't really know.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime is okay. It's really something that's acceptable to watch while you eat to pass the time, but it's not something I would recommend you to go out of your way to watch unless you're really interested in learning about Japanese candy that you may want to try.",

            "content": "Dagashi Kashi is one of those anime that punches the viewers in the nostalgia. Unlike many of the other anime which also produce down this like, I'll confidently say that the creativity behind Dagashi Kashi is through the roof. \r\nI'll skip the synopsis and whatnot and go straight to explaining. \r\nAt first, Dagashi Kashi might seem a bit plotless or plain. You're actually correct; there's actually no major plot in this and it is plain. There's little to no romance and just looking at it, all that's left is the humour. But this is not what this anime is aiming for. Dagashi Kashi wants it'sviewers to hit that nostalgia spot and wants you to crawl back into your childhood. \\n\\n\r\nLet's stand back a bit and look at anime from a wide perspective. Anime is targeted towards its local audience (Japan) before considering the foreign audience (other countries). Coming from an Asian background, childhood mainly consists of: Playing at the park, doing crazy things with other kids, and of course; visiting a Candy shop (Unfortunately Candy Shop are getting rarer and rarer so finding one is very difficult nowadays.) \\n\r\nFrom the whole 12 episodes of Dagashi Kashi which advertised a new candy on every episode, I've probably tasted around 30-40% of them. I've seen many of them before but never had a chance to taste them. Every time a candy that I've tasted or seen, I just think back of the time when I'd spend the weekly pocket money all on these candy and eat them all with friends. Really hits the spot, dead on.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was definitely well done; Characters were lacking depth but that shouldn't matter in this case as there is no major plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, you will definitely enjoy this anime if you had a childhood that can relate to this anime. If you don't, just take this experience to build a list of Dagashi that you want to buy when you visit Japan for a holiday.\\n\\n\r\nAdieu!",

            "content": "Going into the anime season, there was a bit of hype for this particular series, but for what reason. The hype was for the characters and especially how they are designed. (Video review is up on my channel, here is the written)\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nDagashi Kashi is set in a quiet rural village, where the occupants spend their time just chilling around, finding some fun things to do. The story is about Hotaru, who works as snacks company recruit, trying to convince the owner of a local dagashi shop to be an employer. However, Yo Shikada, who is the owner of the shop won\u2019t simply agreeto Hotaru\u2019s term, unless she is able to convince his son, Kokonotsu to take up reigns as the head of the shop, but Kokonotsu has no intention of becoming the next head, as he has his own dreams. And so begins the wonderful attempts and stories on how Hotaru tries to convince Kokonotsu to take over the shop, through Dagashi.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the story is presented is that it\u2019s all sketch based, so even though there is a overarching story, you hardly see it progress. There is not really if any progression at all. It\u2019s all about the characters eating Dagashi in different ways. And if you don\u2019t know what Dagashi is, it\u2019s basically Japanese sweets. And that is there really is talk about the story. What I find annoying about the show is, how at times it does feel like was progressing, especially the few times they showed backstories and having characters ponder about the future, but in the end none of that ever really comes in to play, most of them feel like they don\u2019t mean anything. And from there, the story gets kind of stale.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the best part of the show, not for their developments but just for the fact they are fun characters to like.\\n\\n\r\nKokonotsu Shikada is the main protagonist, and he is setup to becoming the successor of the Dagashi shop, however he dreams to be a manga artist. Of course his dad and Hotaru want him to be next owner of the store. Even he has no intentions of becoming the next store owner, he is somewhat a control freak. As he will always criticise on how his dad runs the store, add that with the fact he has a really decent dagashi knowledge, so him becoming the next owner is not just for the sake of Hotaru, but he has the ability and potential to become one as well. The only development we really get from him at the very end is when he questions whether he wants to pursue his dreams or accept his fate and take over the dagashi shop. Outside of that I wouldn\u2019t see say he\u2019s greatly interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHotaru Shidare is one of the main girls of the show. She is a very weird character, a very eccentric individual having a completely profound love for dagashi. Literally all she ever eats is dagashi and she lives on dagashi. She is very knowledgeable when it comes to dagashi, and hences uses her knowledge to test Kokonotsu on his knowledge and the two usually end up butting heads with each other on even ground with their knowledge. Throughout the show, she doesn\u2019t really show any sign of change, as if anything involving her, it\u2019s about dagashi. We never really learn much of her backstory or motives.\\n\\n\r\nSaya Endo is one of Kokonotsu\u2019s childhood friends bearing crush on him as well. She is kind of the character to have around as the more straight level headed character, basically she a way for the characters who know a lot about dagashi to explain how to eat dagashi. Saya is not really enthusiastic about dagshi, but she does bear a hidden talent for playing different type of games. She probably shows the most character development, actually deciding what she wants, and she likes the fact she gets the hang around everyone, although sort of selfish of her, she wants everyone to stay together. \\n\\n\r\nTo Endo and Yo Shikada are other supporting characters that are kind of just around to provide more comedy to the table. What I like about the characters is their interactions with each other. The characters have good chemistry with each other and they complement each other\u2019s unique personalities as well. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 6/10, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat somewhat made this anime pretty hype was the character designs of Hotaru and I think Saya. Hotaru is kind of out there, with her most distinguish feature being her big eyes, which to be honest looks like a Rinnegan. And Saya being sort of the opposite of her in almost every way has the tiniest eyes. The background and scenery is rather basic as there is not really much going on ever in the quiet town. What they do pretty well is get the dagashi designs right, as when they show it at the end of the episode, it looks very accurate. There are some nice subtle animation during the times when they start eating dagashi.I really like that all the characters have unique designs and very noticeable at the same time. For a slice of life show though, not a lot happens, so you wouldn\u2019t get really complex animation.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I can say about the OST, is that it\u2019s really bouncy. Like the music suits the comedy genre and although it doesn\u2019t add to the scenes all that much, it is somewhat enjoyable to listen to. You can some classical fancy triumph music in there as well. The opening is pretty catchy and has a nice rhythm to it, until it gets the chorus, which I don\u2019t like it all that much. The ED, sung by Hotaru\u2019s seiyu, is nice but, I\u2019m not a huge fan of it, it sounds simple and kind of annoying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI really appreciated that the anime tried to do something very different, making a show about Japanese sweets. But the way it was executed can get a little boring. For first few times when eat dagashi and all the creative ways of explaining how to eat can be entertaining, but it gets really repetitive and stale. Same with the comedy, the jokes get old over time. But what I do like about the show is character interactions, their conversations with each other, seeing their personalities collide. And to be honest, I liked the parts when they weren\u2019t eating dagashi more than the parts when they were, because it got really repetitive in the way they presented it. But also the fact, I don\u2019t know what dagashi is and if you don\u2019t have any idea what dagashi is you\u2019re probably not going to care as much, because you don\u2019t know what it is, you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good or not. The majority of the show is product placement.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs we draw closer to the end of the review, I give the story a 6, because it doesn\u2019t really go anywhere when there a times when I thought it will progress, but it doesn\u2019t. And it\u2019s not much of a great story overall. But I do like the different sketches they can come up with, and appreciate the fact they try to do something very unique, \\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound, I give it a 6 and 6. The animation is not bad, it does good things here and there, but doesn\u2019t blow me away. The art style is pretty good a unique, I like how they have very unique designs for the characters and make it very noticeable. The ost fits the comedy genre very well, but the OP and ED is rather skip able.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters I give them a 7. Even though there is not really much development by any of the characters, I love the interactions and banter between the characters. Despite the contradicting personalities, they all have really good chemistry with each other.\\n\\n\r\nAs for my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 7. Yes the first few episodes were enjoyable, but the formula got old and boring. And the fact I don\u2019t have a great knowledge and sense of dagashi, I couldn\u2019t really care too much for what they were trying to promote. Basically it was product placement.\\n\\n\r\nSo for the overall score after rounding it all up, I give Dagashi Kashi a 6.5/10. If you don\u2019t get bored and mind the repetitiveness it is an enjoyable show. I recommend this show to slice of life fans, and those with knowledge of dagashi, as this is mostly likely aimed towards you.",

            "content": "Dagashi Kashi is an anime all about...Dagashi which are Japanese candies/sweets. That is what 95% of the show is about, talking about Dagashi.\r\nI'll start with the good parts. I found the art to be rather strange at first but it does grow on you and is a nice change from the art most anime's put out and the sound is also rather good as well.\r\nNow for the bad parts. There is almost zero plot/story, it starts out with what could be an interesting but nothing never seen before plot point that basically only gets touched upon briefly in the last two episodes, other then thattheir is no plot but some side stories do come up....based around the Dagashi that is the main focus for that part of the episodes. Characters, well their aren't too many characters but they hardly get any focus either anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the ED is probably the thing I most enjoyed about this anime and with the interesting art style you will eventual get use to and decent sound their was not much enjoyment for me, if you are into Dagashi then it will probably be more enjoyable to you.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for or need a decent story, or any story, in your anime skip this one.",

            "content": "So it ends........the food porn, that is. So  far, this anime hasn't delivery much except show us audience all things that concern about the Japanese snack things. In fact I feel like watching something from TLC, which would be too obnoxious for the likes of Antony Bordain and Andrew Zimmer. I'd said too obnoxious because it still has that Japanese exaggeration element, where I feel like giving the author a head slap, but then again I'd appreciate the simplicity of the anime as a whole:\r\nOn the story side of this anime, I'd say that there isn't any story plot at all, it was justa guy who is a mangka wannabe, who has to take over the business and the story plot ends there when some odd buxom girl arrives in the scene and that where the food docu starts.......Let's face it, man, when the buxom girl starts to yap about Japanese snacks, you're no longer watching an entertaining anime but a docu....a very funny docu that is.\\n\\n\r\nOn the art side, ok so there isn't that quintessential knee high sock wearing bimbo, the replacement, some buxom girl in a Gothic lolita outfit, the only consultation about her is her big melons, hate to say it fashion-wise only Saya  nailed it. Kokonutsu's fashion looks like something that's out of this world, Tou's fashion is that of some Hawaiian Haole whom them Hawaiians would like to feed to the Sharks. And You, more like some guy who should be in the farmlands.   \\n\\n\r\nCharacter side, I probably would have like Kokonutsu if he would be in a relationship with Saya, instead of an oddball like Hotaru, now Hotaru maybe entertaining, but I really can't imagine that an oddball like her would take a long journey back and forth everyday just to pester Kokonutsu into taking over his family business, now don't get me wrong even as an audience, I don't think that Hotaru should be commuting that long everyday just to go to Kokonutsu's place, I wish author Kotoyama should have put Hotaru in a situation where she gets to live with Kokonutsu and dad as most sudden girl appearance genre , at least she can keep on convincing him to take over the business and the ending- Kokonutsu agrees and she get's to go home and You get to work for her daddy. Saya, well she the usual childhood friend, but as the anime ends somehow the direction goes more on Kokonutsu heading towards the oddball Hotaru, frankly I can only pity her for being in a usual childhood friend position. Tou and You, they just serves as the comic relief, thought I would have prefer that Tou is cast as a hot cool guy rather than just Saya's punching bag.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment side, it was enjoyable to a certain extent, especially when the focus is on Hotaru, sure there is that comedy element in it, but at time I would feel like skipping some episodes that were just too cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nSince all that matters it the \"Overall\" I'm gonna give this anime a 6 as in \"fair,\" the story lack a certain follow up where it ends when oddball girl comes in the picture. The fashion is only on Saya. Enjoyable as it maybe , some episode are just too cheesy, bust since the comedy live up to it, it really should have such score.\\n\\n\r\nBtw this is my 1st review, pls bear with me.",

Anyways, it turns out it is an anime based on Japanese Sweets called Dagashi .. And  i guess Kashi means SHoP!( So Sweet SHop).\r\nYeah a really japanesey anime. Better watch dub to understand it better(unless ofcourse you are knowledgible on that account.\r\nStory ? It doesnt have one .They basically set it up so that they can talk about candy So if you came looking for story ,i suggest yousearch other anime.\\n\r\nBut if you arent a person who knows much about Japan but want to..THEN GO FOR IT!!! Each episode talks about two or more candy (more or less). \\n\\n\r\nYou'd think that's boring..But no it is HILARIOUS and INFORMATIVE .How ? That  is where we meet the characters . For a show based on real life candy You can expect to have minimal characters.  This one had only 5 main characters . I wont go into specifics but you wi\\l know a little bit going into the anime.\\n\\n\r\nKokonotsu - The frail looking hero who spires to be a mangaka.But is forced to look after and one day take over the family Dagashi shop (ShikadaDAGASHI) by his Father. YO\\n\\n\r\nYo- Yo is YO MAN! what else i gott tell y? go wacth this mn in action.. Though he isnt in every episod he plays his part brilliantly. \\n\\n\r\nTo - Yeah i put him here for the rhyme! . He is the best friend of Kokonotsu . He is the Stereotypical hippy dude . Again he gets very little screen time but does make it count in one epic episode! (#NoSpoilerS). He and his sister run a local cafe where the three usually hang.\\n\\n\r\nSaya - The sister of To , She was kokonotsu's childhood friend and like many others before her... a generic troupe that has always been a favourite for all anime - A Tsundere ( if your  a newbie and dont know the Dere usage go check out The Anime Man on youtube)\\n\\n\r\nShe has had a crush on our hero ever since they were kids and the overused troupe pairing that we have all grown accustomed to are brought to life by these two (seriously they re  a modern version of ash and misty).\\n\\n\r\nBut i guess the reason why he hasnt noticed her is brought out in several instances by  our next character and by far the LIFE OF THE PARTY \\n\\n\r\n- Hotoru Shidare - A busty teenage girl who happens to be the daughter of a big dagashi company.\\n\\n\r\nShe is the driving force behind the anime .I WONT SAY HOW , but lets just say she loves candy.\\n\r\nShe is the MOST UNIQUE OUT OF THE BUNCH. and certainly my favorite .\\n\r\n I m  a relative newbie to anime but i have seen atleast a bunch such genre anime and never has there been a more amazing character that you wanna watch more of.\\n\\n\r\nShe is hilarious , sexy and completely RANDOM. to the point you think whether she is a crazy chick! But that uniquenes is what makes this anime worth watching\\n\\n\r\nso many Sexual inuendos , awkward situations and yes oh the fan servicing (Probably not worth the echhi title but some very unique scenes)totally meant for FAPing (#For_Academic _Purposes!)\\n\\n\r\nArt style was satisfactory( i have seen a lot more better animation) Sounds..well not very relevant as they mainly don't play a role. It is a quite anime set in a remote villagey location .\\n\\n\r\nAs from my side i highly encourage you to watch the DUB version as it will really bring Hotaru to life ( Great voice acting done in a way that will make a japanesey title more english speaking frienlY)\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed it it is one of the few anime that i rewatch every now and then, you wint ever get bored!.-\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf genre is what you are still wondering -  Echhi , Comedy , General Knowledge(nd  a hint of romance!",

The B part also has them talk about a candy or store good.  A different candy or store good.  And that is our whole plot.  No seriously, that is our whole plot.  As such, Dagashi is one of those shows that is more or less a one-trick pony.  They spend each half episode talking about a specific type of candy only to go more in-depth with each origin, gimmick, and the shit you can do with each individual candy, before ending off the episode.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show uses a form of comedy that bounces off of a straight man/funny man setup where we have the characters split off into one role or the other, and create this mix of exaggerated notes and whatnot to keep the show interesting.  The overall atmosphere is rather calm as there really is nothing tension-wise in this series.  Overall, story is basically nonexistent in Dagashi, as there is no real sense of progression or urgency to create something interesting.  The show itself is like candy, where you can just start it, watch an episode, before putting it to the side so you can watch another episode a different day if you want, like a pack of M&Ms.  It's very laid-back and can get kind of boring sometimes as a result of that.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Educational?  (I mean, if you're not from Japan, you're being educated on Japanese candy.)\\n\r\n-   There's...really nothing going on.  It's literally just candy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Dagashi Kashi has 5 characters.  5.  That's it.  All of these characters are one-dimensional characters that really have nothing of real importance to them.  There's no development, and you more or less have to go off of their innate traits in order to even relate and/or like any of them.  As mentioned before, the show plays off of a straight man/funny man routine with the characters more or less evenly split amongst the two roles.\\n\\n\r\nCoconuts.  Main Protagonist.  Wants to be a Mangaka, doesn't want to take over the candy shop business, but ironically knows far too much about candy and or snack foods than he really should.  (More or less designated straight man.)\\n\\n\r\nHotaru.  Main female Protagonist.  Obsessed about candy and snacks.  (That is an understatement might I add.)  Eats Dagashi.  Eats more Dagashi.  Basically doesn't do anything else but eat Dagashi this entire runtime.  Also kind of crazy.  (More or less the designated funny woman.)\\n\\n\r\nTou.  Coconuts's friend.  The token pervert of the series.  (Really, that's all we know about him.  More or less a designated funny man more than anything else.)\\n\\n\r\nSaya.  Tou's twin sister who also has a crush on Coconuts.  Not really a big fan of candy but deals with it on a constant basis nonetheless.  Secret boss for a lot of things and a generally likable character.  At least to me.  (The designated straight woman in this case.)\\n\\n\r\nYou.  Coconuts's dad.  Doesn't act his age and appears the least in the whole series.  Is also quite obsessed with candy himself.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, there really isn't much to say about any of these characters.  The fact that there's not really much to talk about either of them, nor is there any possible way for me to really analyze them more than I already have really just drives home the fact that you can watch an episode of this stuff like...once a month, and you can go back to it really knowing what happens since there really isn't much to remember.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Small cast.  (Like...REALLY small cast.)\\n\r\n-  Each member is...rather one dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The art of Dagashi is drawn in a way that really doesn't have much in the way of memorabilia.  It's drawn with a relatively unique style with the unique eye choice of being tiny dot pupils rather than big moe eyes, but on the flipside, there really isn't much to say about the artwork.  \\n\\n\r\nOne thing to note is that they go a Shokugeki route with the art, making some scenes very...risque.  Well, not risque, but the show sometimes insinuates things with its characters during some scenes and that gives off a bit of an ecchi feeling for the show.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/-  Decent art\\n\r\n+/-  Some ecchi/ecchi related moments\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The OP is an energetic song to relate to the overall feel of the show in comparison to the fact that a lot of what the show does involves somewhat energetic sequences in order to keep itself interesting and entertaining.  It's a decent OP, but it's not the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED on the other hand features an Alice in Wonderland inspired visuals with a sort of generic ED song.  There really isn't much to say here.  Point being, the OST isn't really all that memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\n+/-  Meh OST\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Dagashi Kashi is...well it's a show.  I don't really harbor many ill or positive feelings towards this show simply because of the fact that it stylized itself the way it did.  The original manga for this series more or less is structured the same way, and concerning myself with the fact that they more or less did a faithful adaptation to the more or less one-note comedy gag manga featuring sweets and adverts doesn't seem fair.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nOut of everything about this anime, the one thing I liked most was Saya.  Saya is by far my favorite character in this series and I don't know why.  Maybe it's because she's not overly tsun and she's a tsundere type character I grew to like, but aside from that, I really have no explanation.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly....really nothing.  As mentioned before, this anime doesn't really evoke much hatred for me cause it more or less does its own thing, and there's just not much to say.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to learn about Japanese candy or just have some time to kill and you don't want to watch a 3 minute short, then here's Dagashi Kashi for you.  There really isn't much to say about this show.  It's a show devoted to telling its viewers what and how Japanese candy works, roughly tackling about 24 or so different snack foods that exist in the Japanese market today.  As such, Dagashi merits more as a time waster than an actual series anime to get into.  Just be mindful to bring a snack when watching, cause this show has been known to evoke in some...hunger, on occasion.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Note:  Also, since this anime is basically a huge advertisement, I'mma put my own here because why not.  Ahem.  \"Come down to PyraXadon's anime page!  We got reviews, LOTS OF THEM.  And I'm always active, so if you got any questions, I'll always be around!  I also give out advice for reviewing.

One day a mysterious girl named Hotaru Shidare appears looking for the potential employees that are well-versed with the world of Dagashi and Kokonotsu seems just the person. However, his father refuses to let his son join unless Hotaru could somehow convince him to take over the store first. As Kokonotsu refuses and instead aspires to become a Manga artist, the Dagashi obssessed Hotaru is determined to change his mind.\r\nWhen I first heard this title I thought the title was a word play on \"da ga, shikashi (buthowever)\" but, it's all about cheap Japanese snacks that you'll probably have come across if like me you grew up with a lot of Japanese food. It features a lot of real world snacks like whistle candy but, the jokes themselves are horribly done and doesn't make sense. Only fun is watching Hotaru's goofy expressions although it does sort of return to the regular scenarios like romance etc.\\n\\n\r\nIt's filled with fan service but, it's fun learning about how the various snacks came about and might even make you pick some up next time you're in a Japanese snacks store. Who knew that the drink \"ramune\" got its name from the Japanese mishearing the pronunciation for \"lemonade\"?\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, if you don't care about cheap dagashi snacks or ramune then best avoid.",

            "content": "You will probably heard about Dagashi Kashi being a few hours worth of advertisement for Japanese snacks. I'm here to tell you that... I agree as well.\r\nDagashi Kashi can be a bit heartwarming and stress-free due to the environment settings and no climax or cliffhanging plot. The setting of this anime puts the character in a small town out of city, no overly advanced technology, little to no cars on the road, train or bus could cause you to wait for hours if you missed it. The vibe of such peaceful environment paired with slice of life element can be a bit relaxing at times.\r\nLet'stalk about the story. Mainly, Dagashi Kashi is talking about Japanese snacks so if you are someone who would love to know them, I would suggest that this anime could be for you. Storywise, the anime is fixated on a boy who dreamed to become a manga artist but is asked to inherit his family business, as dagashi shop owner, which is not what he wants. The story starts off smooth with this introduction with decent potential. However, as the episode goes on, it felt like a random episode introducing different types of dagashi that fits the theme, which don't really contribute to the main story apart from the main character knows a lot about dagashi. Thus, it starts to grow a little bit bland overtime.\\n\\n\r\nOnto characters. The characters in Dagashi Kashi is quite limited. This is good in a sense that the anime will focus on these characters. However, paired with the issue with the story, the growth of the characters are very slow (because the anime's main point is the dagashi!). I have to admit that the characters are quite likeable as some of them often gives you a good laugh, IMO none of them feels boring, they each have their own likeable characteristics. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, Dagashi Kashi is a relaxing, comedy, slice-of-life anime. If you are someone who is after for an interesting plot, this might not be your cup of tea but if you have some spare time, you can give it a shot. If you are someone who loves to learn more about Japanese snacks in form of anime, I recommend you to try and pick this up! \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: \\n\r\nWant to know about Japanese snack, pick this up; \\n\r\nWant a decent story and plot, drop this; \\n\r\nWant to spend some time for a relaxing anime, you can try to see if it suits you.",

She is my 2nd favorite character in the show. There are times i wish she wasn't so obsessed with Dagashi and kind of more like a normal girl. But she is pretty fun.\r\nSaya: Is my favorite. I really just love her entire character and her character model. I wish wegot and entire series just based on Saya and Hotaru together sense they are really the only part of the show worth too watch. Saya is also really adorable as a child.\\n\\n\r\nThe art can take a bit to get used too. But it is pretty nice.\\n\\n\r\nNot much else to mention with the show.

            "content": "The longest commercial I've ever watched and it worked.  It just goes to show what putting anime girls next to your product can do.\r\nThere is nothing particularly outstanding about this anime, if you are interested in learning a bit about dagashi through another means besides Wikipedia, I'm sure you could find this interesting enough to check out.\r\nThere are also jokes, which are sometimes funny I guess. If you don't enjoy the art style or the characters, you probably won't enjoy watching this.\r\nLet's break it down then, since MAL wants me to write an unnecessarily long review. For the record, you don't need to readany of this, I've already said all that needs to be said.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 4\\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple. A boy wants to become a mangaka, but his dad owns a candy shop and wants him to inherit it. One day, a girl shows up and wants to take his father away to work at their company. Unfortunately, doing this will force the boy to inherit the shop, so the father refuses to leave unless he does so.\\n\\n\r\nSo there is the premise, but the story mostly unfolds through the explaining of dagashi, and not derivative \"WacDonalds\" level parody stuff, but actual dagashi that exist in real life, where the previously mentioned girl, Hotaru, will usually explain the history of it with her usual hijinks that become a staple of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThere is another girl by the name of Saya, who is the main character, Kokonotsu's (Whom is often referred to as \"Coconuts\" as a pun throughout the series.) childhood friend. She likes coffee, but dislikes sweet things, so there is kind of that clash between her and Hotaru, as the three of them get to know each other as the advertising- I mean story unfolds.\\n\\n\r\nART: 6\\n\\n\r\nDagashi Kashi's art direction is different, but it's also one of its main appeals. (So much so, that the season 2 art style has been seen with disappointment.) The character designs are simple, but have a charm to them. One of my favorite design choices are how the eyes are done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\\n\r\nBarring aside the OPs and EDs, which have nothing to do with the series itself (Hence my reason for skipping them after a single viewing.), there is nothing noteworthy to say about the sound here. It's not bad, but it's not good either. As background music, it does its purpose and nothing more. The voice acting is good, but not enough for me to warrant raising the score of the entire series' sound direction.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nThere's not really a lot to say about the characters, they're simple, but fun. I've described them and their premise earlier, but a lot of what makes them charming is the art design and voice acting. They're essentially what sells you on them, but if you're not a fan of their design or voices, I'm not too sure there is really any in depth \"character\" or \"personality\" if you will, that is going to attract you if the other two options failed.\\n\\n\r\nTsundere Coffee Girl\\n\r\nHyper Candy Maniac \\n\r\nShy Manga  Boi\\n\r\nThe Side Character (Haha didn't even mention him.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nNot going to waste anymore time repeating myself, the characters and art style of the show are what sold me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\\n\r\nIf it wasn't for the fact I found the characters appealing and the main topic of the show interesting, I probably would have never finished this show. Actually, finding enjoyment in that alone is probably not enough for most people to finish it, but what can I say? I wanted to see more every time the end of an episode came.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were a more cynical person incapable of finding enjoyment in simple things, I would have torn this series apart, but I like fun things. Not like there was anything better that season anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOh wait...",

            "content": "I can't really think of anything clever this time, so let's just start.\r\nStory:\r\nThe plot is supposed to be about Hotaru trying to convince Coconuts to take over the candy store of his father. However, this is just an excuse to have these characters in this specific setting. This in itself wouldn't be much of a problem if they did something with it, but they don't. 80% of the time all we get is Hotaru introducing a new piece of candy to us and acting like it's the best thing since sliced bread. This shtick gets old very fast, especially if you don't really care aboutcandies or their history.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe thing that got most people to watch this anime in the first place was the character design of Hotaru. She and Saya really do look pretty interesting, the boys however not so much. Animated, this effect fades quickly though. It almost looks as if they didn't get much of a budget to animate Dagashi Kashi, which also shows heavily in the opening, which is poorly animated. Hotarus candy fantasies look decent and are a nice change in style, but there aren't many of them. The ending looks kinda awkward with its realistic style of movement, but that may just be a question of taste. It's not a catastrophe, but it could be better.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty good, even though the seiyuus don't have much to work with. Music in general was barely noticeable, which is still better than being annoying. The opening and ending songs weren't my cup of tea, but I gotta admit they were a little catchy.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis show is supposed to be all around Hotaru, so it pretty much stands and falls with her character. It looks like there are only two possibilities, you either hate or love her. I found her to get very annoying very quickly, as there is nothing to her besides her candy addiction. Coconuts is a very boring character as well, having basically no personality. The Endou twins were more interesting and entertaining, so I'm glad the anime used them a bit more than the manga does (or so I heard). You is also pretty entertaining, but he rarely ever appears on screen, so I can't really count him. For such a small cast, it needed to be more dynamic and eccentric.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs I said, the jokes get old fast. People have defended Dagashi Kashi to be \"apparently not your kind of comedy\" but I don't think that's true. It just ain't funny most of the time. It did get me to laugh every now and then, but for a comedy, I expect much, much more. If you groan as much as you laugh when watching a comedy anime, there is something seriously wrong with it.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n4.6/10",

You could even go as far as to say there is no story in the first place. What we have here is pretty much an advertisement/ promotional anime for Japanese candy and snacks. \r\nLet's start with what little there is to tell - the conflict. Our protagonist wants to be a manga artist, and his dad wants him to inherit his candy shop (and work there). ..... That's it. That's the whole conflict and backstory. Then comes a good looking girl who's obsessed withcandy and claims to be the daughter of a huge candy company owner who wants the shop to join, and the protagonist's father immediately agrees.. Or rather sets a condition that if she gets his son to agree and inherit the shop, they will join. Since he's not eager to do that, she decides to stay in town and visit him every day to try change his mind. And there the story progression stops. Till the very end of it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's the rest then you ask? Fanservice with sexual suggestive themes and jokes, general comedy and just goofing around while advertising Japanese snacks and candy while going into their history. And as bad as that may sound, the result is actually somewhat enjoyable. How exactly that is is beyond me (and not its not the fanservice).\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, its not an AMAZING anime by any means, just a decent one, but one that is still worth a watch. 6.3/10",

            "content": "Dagashi Kashi started out for me as a somewhat odd slice of life comedy about Japanese candy (dagashi).  Now, since I'm not Japanese, I've never heard of any any of these bizarre but fairly ingenious candies, so at first I was fairly intrigued by the premise.  \r\nThe art is pretty crisp, though this was made by feel. so I guess that's to be expected at this point.  The Op/Ed are pretty good, and the art style is pretty different but I found it enjoyable.  Hotaru's spirally eyes are a pretty good indication of just how bonkers she is.  \r\nThe basicrundown of the plot is like so: Kokonotsu (Coconuts) is an aspiring manga artist who runs his father's Dagashi shop when his dad (Yo/You)is busy slacking off (which is most of the time).  Apparently his dad is famous somehow though, so Hotaru, the heiress of a large Dagashi manufacturer, visits to convince Kokonotsu to take over his father's store so that Yo can work for Hotaru's father.  Since Kokonostu is reluctant to give up on his dream of drawing manga, we now have the premise for the show:  Hotaru must convince Kokonotsu that Dagashi are the Best Thing Ever.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some nice moments in the show, some good comedy, and I enjoyed it while I was watching it.  However, I can't help but feel like part of that enjoyment was built on the assumption that the show would have a satisfying conclusion.  In the end, it pretty much goes down like this:\\n\\n\r\nHotaru: \"Make your decision.\"\\n\r\nKokonotsu: \"Do I really have to?\"\\n\r\nHotaru: \"No, not really LOL\"\\n\\n\r\nHe just sort of walks off with Hotaru, without deciding anything.  I guess Saya is just left hanging, never seeing her beloved Coconuts again.  I don't mind a simple and formulaic plot for the sake of advertising candy, but come on, at least finish what you started.  If you're gonna have an ultimatum in episode 11, I'd expect a decision in episode 12.  \\n\\n\r\nI'd say that Dagashi Kashi is entertaining if you go in knowing that you're not going to get anything all that fulfilling out of this.  This is one of those odd cases where the whole of the show is lesser than its parts individually.  Ultimately, it fails to properly resolve the most basic of plots.",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Dagashi Kashi. I actually didn't think this anime was going to be a slice of life candy history show. I thought candy was going to be the backdrop, however it is the only drop and sadly I feel a bit disappointed. That however is my fault, not the fault of the anime. Lets talk  about it a bit more.\r\nThe story, if you can call it that, begins with the introduction of a candy shop. This candy shop is in a small village in Japan and it is run by a weird father, and his son whowants to draw manga. The father wants the son to take over this shop, which has been in the family for generations. One day a girl arrives and tries to recruit the father, but he refuses unless this woman could convince his son to take over the family shop. That is the basic framework of the show. \\n\\n\r\nFrom there Dagashi Kashi progresses in a slice of life pace. Each episode has some form of Dagashi which the female lead (Shidare, Hotaru) presents and explains. This at the beginning was generally used as a ploy to somehow convince  (Shikada, Kokonotsu) to run the Dagashi shop. The explanations seem to be a mix of truth and exaggeration, though since I do not know about the candy being talked about I don't know if it is actually true or not. There are clearly some falsehoods however because this is how they try to drive in the comedy. The ending of the show got a bit more better at exploring the characters and other themes however the candy information never stops.\\n\\n\r\nThe art seemed lame at first, however I came to appreciate it almost immediately. The characters are done really well and it felt rather unique. Music wasn't terrible either.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are as mentioned above. A father (Shikada, You), who seems to be incompetent and humorous but seems to be some Dagashi guru. Then his son (Shikada, Kokonotsu), who wants to draw manga. His personality is a bit more mellow, and he plays the role of the questioner, who prompts Hotaru into talking about Dagashi. His best friend (Endou, Tou), who is sort of the idiot character, and is truly the center of some of the best comedy in the show. His sister (Endou, Saya), who runs a cafe in the same town. She secretly likes Kokonotsu. Then finally we have (Shidare, Hotaru), who is this rich, crazy, dagashi loving person. She spends most of the time in the show, imparting knowledge, being unlucky and adding some sexual themes(though she herself is incredibly dense, or rather uninterested in things outside of dagashi).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have charm. I wish the romance elements were more put together, as Saya was cute. I did enjoy the times in between the candy lessons, as they tended to have a simplistic and comedic feel. Hotaru, was  a huge distraction and wasn't really what I had hoped the show was centering around.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show isn't bad. However out of 12 episodes I think I managed to laugh three or four times. I would be willing to watch a season two, especially since nothing comes about by the end of the first. However this seemed like it was trying to hit a funny bone which I simply don't posses. If someone out there likes Hotaru and her antics you may find this a bit more enjoyable to watch. For those of you not interested in semi comedic candy lessons, you will probably be mostly bored and unamused like I was. This season has been a great one for new and unexplored ideas, however each of these seem to be boring and lame for one reason or another.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Boring and non funny candy lectures. Nothing happens, no part of this anime progresses or comes to a conclusion. Saya was cute, though. Watch if you don't mind the candy bits.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nOne of my favorite candies is the Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cup.\r\nAlthough not just any Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cup. I am not a fan of the regular-sized ones let alone the mammoth kind. Also, I don\u2019t much care for the miniscule ones from the orange, portable bag. No, they have to be the bite-sized kind with the golden wrappers. Their peanut-butter-to-chocolate ratio is superb; I could eat them for hours.\r\nIn other words, Reese\u2019s cups are just not the same without the gold. Similarly, Dagashi Kashi is nothing without its dagashi-driven damsel.\r\nSTORY\r\nCandy, as Dagashi Kashi indirectly explains,is not the right word for the treats talked about in the anime. No, these delectable offerings are dagashi (hence the title). While they are mass produced in the same way as candy from America, dagashi are more than just taste and branding. They have special designs. They have particular purposes. They have a history worth learning.\\n\\n\r\nSo the anime takes this mindset to heart (and to mouth). Each episode is dedicated to a variety of dagashi that are more interesting than the next. A bottle filled with a sugar-like substance whose bottle can also be eaten. Heart-shaped chocolates meant to make one run farther. Caramels that were originally designed to deter cigarettes. Numerous dagashi are showcased over the course of the season. Too many to reasonably list.\\n\\n\r\nTo this end, Dagashi Kashi is extremely educational in its content. It talks about the mascots behind Baby-Star Ramen. It describes how there is no real significance to the eight letters of the Seven Neon dagashi. It tells the tale of how Miyako Kombu derived from the leftover bits of kombu, a local food.\\n\\n\r\nAlso on the dagashi industry itself. Some have extra winners to get more dagashi. Some can be used for more than just eating, like jumping rope or blowing whistles. Some have particular packaging with cute characters to entice kids to pick them over the many, many others.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, like a dagashi store, Dagashi Kashi holds a veritable wealth of (educational) goodies.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the anime understands that nothing but education can get stagnate, so it includes comedy and sexual material to alleviate this issue. The comedy is light, confectionary even, using silly reactions, goofy explanations, and personified dagashi to make the learning fun. The sexual material is likewise light, focusing on a flapped skirt or, almost always, Hotaru\u2019s breasts.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, because the sex does not deviate from her huge chest, it tends to be repetitive and lacking in creativity. Quite unlike the dagashi the anime so actively supports. Even so, the simplistic, not-over-the top direction it takes with the sex does go along with the dagashi motif. After all, dagashi themselves are simple but hugely popular treats.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the dagashi and the education and the sex, the anime doesn\u2019t have much more. And that\u2019s a problem. The overarching plot of Hotaru trying to convince Coconuts to take over his father\u2019s shop gets addressed only sparingly and does not get resolved come the end of the season. The implied romantic feelings between the semi-love-triangle go nowhere. And the slice-of-life escapades that do not directly deal with dagashi \u2013 like going to a cultural festival \u2013 are too few and far between to be considered worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nNot that there has to be more. But when the anime regurgitates information about yet another dagashi, it makes the whole experience feel as though it lacks any substance, any purpose.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nDagashi Kashi takes place almost entirely within the dagashi shop that Coconuts and his father run. The quaint place has its wooden walls lined with the treats, making it a fun little dive to hang out in.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does venture outside of the shop, though. Saya and Endo\u2019s caf\u00e9 gets a few visits. A small spot near a river or a local pool are shown. The side of the road, a train station, and Hotaru\u2019s mammoth mansion.\\n\\n\r\nThese places are not as detailed or prominent as the dagashi shop, but they help to highlight a common thread of the art: seclusion. Besides the cultural-festival episode and the few stragglers that pass by or into the shop, the anime is mostly devoid of other people. This secluded countryside comes off as very niche \u2013 just like the dagashi and the history they contain.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation ends up even stronger than the art. The reused setting gives the anime more resources to spend on expressive faces, blinking, and bodily movements. And of course, Hotaru\u2019s breasts receive extra care to make them even more enticing than they already are.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Hotaru, her character design is extremely strong. Medium-length purple hair with a black-rose hair piece. A black-and-white outfit with buttons, suspenders, frills, a skirt, and heels. Red nails. Blue-spiraled, mesmerizing eyes which reflect her overzealous passion. And a gorgeous figure that defies all of the dagashi she eats.\\n\\n\r\nSaya\u2019s design is not as stunning, but it\u2019s still nice. Long, blonde hair that gets different makes. Multiple earring accessories. A tiny fang to make her slightly cuter. Varying outfits, like casual clothes and a yukata. And a slim, pretty figure. Similar to Hotaru, she is attractive. Dissimilar to Hotaru, her attractiveness comes not from eccentricity but rather simplicity.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the rest of the designs are normal, other shout-outs are deserved. The ED\u2019s Alice In Wonderland visuals are quite fun and fitting \u2013 Hotaru makes taking part in dagashi feel as though it were an imaginary (and possibly drug-induced) trip. And the \u201cAnd so\u2026\u201d eye-catches were nice, too.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nDagashi Kashi has to rely on its characters to do most of the heavy lifting in the anime because substantive plot does not exist. Another way to look at it is that, because the setting takes place at a deserted countryside candy shop (and caf\u00e9), it puts a lot of emphasis on the characters. Pressure for them to command a presence.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, one character alone cannot carry the weight of all this dagashi \u2013 try as she may (and she would try).\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the lesser characters, Endo is arguably the weakest of the bunch. As though he were around simply to balance out the boy-to-girl ratio, he does not have much in the way of characterization. He wants to be popular (to get with the ladies), and he almost reveals his sister\u2019s feelings for Coconuts on more than one occasion. That\u2019s the extent of his character.\\n\\n\r\nCoconuts fails to be much of a character, too. He is painstakingly plain with zero personality and a go-with-the-flow attitude. His main purpose is not to be a main character but rather corroborate or introduce many of the dagashi facts that are brought up. On that front, he does fine, but that does not make him all that fun of a character.\\n\\n\r\nCoconuts actually has another trait, but Dagashi Kashi does not seem to care for it. The reason why he does not want to take over his father\u2019s dagashi shop is because he wishes to pursue a career in drawing manga. From what is shown, he has a knack for it. But the anime rarely uses this characteristic in conjunction with the dagashi, existing as little else besides a stepping stone for the premise.\\n\\n\r\nYou, Coconuts\u2019s father, has a bit more going for him. He owns the dagashi shop the other characters hang out in. He runs an (unsuccessful) video channel. He is generally carefree to the point that Coconuts questions his father\u2019s ability to do anything let alone run a business.\\n\\n\r\nHis main problem is similar to Endo and his son: You does not have much else. He does not have a close relationship with his son. He does not interact all that much with Saya and Endo. And the moments he does share with Hotaru are dominated by her presence. He does act as a comedic relief character, but, in a comedy anime, that does not mean much.\\n\\n\r\nSaya pulls ahead of the men but only barely. She has a knack for coffee brewing, and, more importantly, she loves Coconuts. Of course, she refuses to make her feelings known, creating for many a moment of frustration.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, she does not care much for dagashi, yet she is skilled at all of the games and quirks related to them. Card flipping, marble shooting, and prize winning chief among her abilities. Similar to the rest, though, her character does not do much throughout the season. She blushes when Coconuts gets mentioned, and she can play a mean game of kendama (a ball attached with a string to a wooden catcher), but she does not bring much comedy or pizzazz on her own.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s a common issue with these four: They are inherently not interesting. Their traits, personalities, and actions fail to bring engaging interactions because what they say and what they do lacks style.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then Hotaru shows up.\\n\\n\r\nHotaru more or less makes Dagashi Kashi. Without her, the anime would be nothing more than educational material. From the get-go, she is a titillating character. Yes, her massive breasts attract a lot of attention. But it is her craziness. Her bubbly personality. Her never-ending font of determination that make her a character one cannot help but like.\\n\\n\r\nBesides her breasts, her defining trait is her incessant love of dagashi. Every part of her life \u2013 from curing a toothache to reading poetry \u2013 revolves around dagashi in one form or another. Indeed, the whole reason she showed up at the dagashi shop run by Coconuts and his father in the first place was because of dagashi-related business.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the whole season, Hotaru proves her worth constantly. She, like Coconuts, has a vast wealth of knowledge when it comes to dagashi. In fact, she is the one to usually spur the boy on. She brings about comedy with her fake-but-maybe-not accent as well as her ironically horrible luck when it comes to dagashi games. And her bouncing breasts, purple lingerie, and misunderstood mannerisms provide sexuality without overbearing the audience or taking away from the dagashi she preaches.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to Hotaru, the four others are more boring than watching the guy who is watching paint dry. She overshadows Endo, Coconuts, You, and Saya. Twice over.\\n\\n\r\nShe outshines the rest to such a high degree that it begs the question: Does her complete domination serve a purpose?\\n\\n\r\nArguably, yes. From an outside perspective, dagashi is a tame topic. Sour shells, fortune-telling pieces, and powdered snacks are not the best conversation starters. That is, much like the main cast, dagashi is admittedly dull. But with the addition of extra facts, different outlooks, and better enthusiasm, dagashi quickly becomes interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is exactly what Hotaru does. She makes dagashi fun, interesting, by bringing with her the traits, the ideas, and the mindset necessary to turn this boring topic into an intriguing one. Not just with dagashi, though. She applies her magic to the other characters, too. She shows that Endo has some smarts to him. She gets Coconuts to think differently about his life and about people. She demonstrates that You is more than just a lazy man. And she gets Saya to understand her own feelings a bit better.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, these developments are small, and Hotaru is usually oblivious to these separate instances. But she no doubt makes the cast, like dagashi, more interesting than they were before she arrived. An outcome that even the most intense paint-dry-watching people could appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps expectedly, the original soundtrack of Dagashi Kashi does not usually rely on more tame tracks. Instead, it heightens and lowers the tempo. Two tracks in particular stand out. The first is a slow, methodical tune that sounds as though it originates from the countryside with its languid sounds. The second is reminiscent of a Mexican standoff often played when the dagashi antics started rolling up the fun.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s an OST with a nice number of tracks (over forty), but, besides the two listed above, the whole package is not impressive in its offerings.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting mirrors the characters. Ayana Taketatsu as Hotaru shines with her energetic and sincere way of speaking whereas the rest of the cast provide acceptable performances for their roles (but nothing worth noting).\\n\\n\r\nMoving on (or moving back to the beginning), the opening track is a nice addition to the anime. The vocalist\u2019s leveled way of singing works well with the quickness of the instruments. In fact, comparing their combined effort to Dagashi Kashi itself, the contrast is large. By the halfway point, the piece adopts a more triumphant tone when both the singer and the beat reach loftier heights. While nothing is available to win (save for Coconuts\u2019s willingness to run the dagashi shop), this new tone matches how the anime (i.e., Hotaru) views dagashi: like flying through the sky unimpeded.\\n\\n\r\nBut the true winner of the music is the ending track. Mixing accordions, castanets, and dainty chimes, the piece remains consistently fast and fun. Alongside the various hollers, the silly lyrics (\u201cCalorie Queen!\u201d), and the happy vibe, the ED comes together as a catchy piece that, like eating dagashi, is a treat to hear again and again.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of this one\u2019s run, I was concerned that it would not go anywhere. My concerns, unfortunately, were met.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter the medium, a tale will always have an extremely hard time if it tries to bank on a single aspect. In this case, this aspect is Hotaru. To be fair, the anime does have its dagashi, but, to reiterate the earlier discussion, it is Hotaru\u2019s involvement that makes the dagashi more than just treats to eat.\\n\\n\r\nTo that end, I myself found her to be quite the fun character. Her respectful nature towards the cast was nice. Her joking around with You was silly. And her general sexiness was hard to look away from. She was easily my most favorite part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, I cannot say I liked them all too much. Saya\u2019s romantic feelings did have me smiling, and You\u2019s \u201cYo\u2026yo\u2026\u201d chant was goofy. But Coconuts himself and Endo as well rarely made me happy.\\n\\n\r\nOn the dagashi itself, I was not necessarily engrossed by the topic. But to give credit to the anime, I learned a lot about dagashi. While I had never heard of such specialized snacks before, and I more than likely still have a lot left to learn, it was cool being exposed to a piece of culture halfway across the globe. Even it at times the subject matter was not the most interesting.\\n\\n\r\nDagashi Kashi does what it can. The animation levels are nice and the different musical offerings are fun to listen to. Even so, the story lacks anything else besides information, everyone but Hotaru fails to impress, and the amount of entertainment plummets as a combined result. Reese\u2019s gets gold; this one doesn\u2019t even get bronze.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, dagashi and education combine to create a simple tale that lacks substance\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, okay artistic direction, meaningful seclusion, above average actual animation, and nice character designs for both Hotaru and Saya\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Hotaru commands the purposefully boring cast\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, good ED, okay OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, Hotaru is fun, lots of learning, but everything else fails to engross\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "For a show that revolves entirely around candy, Dagashi Kashi is untenably bland.  Heed the warnings of the other reviews: this series is little more than an advertisement for Japanese sweets of various descriptions.  Whether Dagashi Kashi is meant to parade sugary nostalgia in front of Japanese viewers or to serve as a mildly clever marketing ploy for Western audiences remains unclear (likely both are true), but the show clearly has no concerns outside of detailing and extolling the virtues of the exotic sweets you can find at your local specialty sweetshop or on the corner of any Japanese street.  The subjectmatter would make for an informative hour-long documentary on a food-centric network of some sort, but attempting to wring a narrative work with characters and plot out of the fact that sweets exist was a mistake.\\n\\n\r\nDagashi Kashi cares only for dagashi and has no time to spend on anything else; all other considerations get shunted aside whenever a new opportunity arises for a sugar-coated or chocolate-covered gimmick to invite itself into the episode.  The show pays only the paltriest lip service to concepts like plot, characters, and setting.  MAL\u2019s two-paragraph summary contains about as much information about the premise as the show itself delivers in its entire run.  Immediately after laying down a barely workable background for the characters to exist in, the show completely abandons all pretext of pursuing any non-explicitly-dagashi-related plot thread any further than absolutely necessary.  If I remember correctly, the first extended scenario not centered entirely around dagashi comes in episode 6 (and even then it\u2019s still tangentially endorsing something).  I could be mistaken, but it doesn\u2019t matter anyway, because it was still terribly boring, if slightly cute.  \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s almost rude the way Dagashi Kashi establishes Kokonotsu\u2019s conflicting futures \u2013 continuing in his father\u2019s footsteps as the owner of his family\u2019s shop or seeking success elsewhere as a mangaka \u2013 and then sweeps away the main character\u2019s hopes and dreams to focus on more important things, like how many meters a person of average build can run on the caloric energy of a single mouthful of caramel.  Saya has a longstanding and unrequited crush on Kokonotsu (for reasons that remain mysterious, given his complete lack of personality), but once her feelings have been established, they never again become relevant, except for maybe two dumb gags.  The same goes for Kokonotsu\u2019s apparent attraction to Hotaru, though the full nature of his feelings never becomes clear, and Hotaru\u2019s worrying lack of concern for anything not candy renders any attempt to develop the show\u2019s romantic side an exercise in futility.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast ostensibly comprises five characters in total, and not merely five main characters, but five characters who are ever named or have any significance to the series whatsoever.  Kokonotsu\u2019s father can be an amusing presence, undoubtedly made better by Keiji Fujiwara\u2019s delivery.  Most of the time, however, the action involves only Kokonotsu and Hotaru discoursing about this week\u2019s sweets of choice in the charmless interior of the Shikada shop.  The formula of the same two characters jabbering about the same things in the same place every episode gets old within about two minutes.  Dagashi Kashi has so much variety in edible endorsements, and yet so little variety in anything else that the show feels suffocating.  It isn\u2019t until episode 7 that a couple of new one-time characters finally drop in to break up the monotony and something other than dagashi takes the center stage.  The few episodes in the show\u2019s midsection do begin branching out into more creative skits and provide a mildly amusing glimpse into what Dagashi Kashi might have been had the dagashi not levied such brutal demands for screen time, and while the show still isn\u2019t brilliant, it at least feels like a presentable comedy rather than the soulless grind it usually is.  \\n\\n\r\nHotaru\u2019s striking design drew me to Dagashi Kashi, as it no doubt did many others, and I wish I could say that the show had enough substance to merit owning such a unique image.  It\u2019s a shame, because Hotaru\u2019s design is about the only aspect of Dagashi Kashi worth remembering, but at this point I can hardly stand to look at her.  Every time I see those distinctive ringed irises I have to brace myself for a ludicrous speech about the profound, sublime joys of eating something I\u2019ve never heard of, and not even the voice of Ayana Taketatsu can make this dialogue sound clever or enticing.  Hotaru actively makes the show unbearable, boring, and shallow to boot.  \\n\\n\r\nDagashi Kashi is so dedicated to dagashi that every last piece of the show\u2019s construction feels like it is aimed squarely at selling a product.  Nothing feels like a natural part of a show, especially not a comedy show; every joke, every hint of character development, every moment of fan service, every \u201cplot point,\u201d every single aspect of the characters\u2019 actions and demeanors seems like nothing more than a lengthy commercial.  It\u2019s like any television ad that tries to get your attention with a hyper-compressed storyline, hypothetical characters, and light-hearted ribbing.  It\u2019s not a REAL narrative and you aren\u2019t supposed to enjoy it, because it has no substance and doesn\u2019t go anywhere; all you have to do is think that you identify with somebody long enough to let the salesmen unveil their pitch.  Already so much of Dagashi Kashi is mere descriptions of dagashi and their functions, but because of the show\u2019s attitude toward the dagashi, the few aspects not explicitly dedicated to dagashi still feel like part of the scheme.  This feeling makes Dagashi Kashi almost uncomfortable to watch; I felt like I was constantly being shilled to every second I sat in front of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t bother questioning why To wears his sunglasses at night.\\n",

            "content": "Encouraged by the study feel, which has done things like the nostalgic Kiss x Sis, the famous Yosuga no Sora, and crap like Makura no Danshi. We get this anime that once gave something to talk about, but today is as forgotten as Erased at the end of its broadcast.\r\nWe better go quick with this fucking anime shit which I watched in its broadcast last year. Why ?, because I read a post where a moderator of AeE told some member of the Chinese dead that the show of this series would be his Waifu of the season, and surprisingly the design was fucking beautifulso I ran quickly to see the first episode, only to find me in the end ...\\n\\n\r\nAn anime, which starts in a meh way. We start with a dream that our protagonist has, which is a kind of future aspiring manga cartoonist, but who works in his father's snack shop. A day like any other one comes in a pretty-looking asshole who tells our beta that she is someone \"very important\", so that later she challenges him to a kind of sweets and sandwiches contest. Then the father appears and the pretty girl named Hotaru decides to stay in those places to fuck because he can, because he wants and because he has nothing else to do or anywhere else to go. The story is on the way to repeating the same puta formula of duels and contests with this little girl throughout the 12 episodes that constitute this work, falling into a vicious circle that could hardly leave.\\n\\n\r\nAs a point in favor I can say that the first chapters were harmless, they were not remarkable but they were not disastrous either, they were just there, they had harmless humor and you could even learn the odd thing about Japanese sweets and sandwiches. What happened next? The series opted to go degrading itself, going from being a Slice of Life with comedy and situations of daily life in a candy store, to be practically Pandering Otaku for pubertos, one of the stupidest I've seen in a series of that year. The series is downgraded to use its theme for a sexual nature and disgusting fetish that I would be embarrassed to teach my colleagues who only see comedies to pass the time and have some laughs. From winks and sexual messages with candy, to a construction of a disc Yuri bait between the two girls in the series. Not to mention that the series is super boring to have situations that are very fast, characters who do not care about a peanut and who spend talking about candy all the time, and in a way that you get tired. When I say that the only reason why someone would see this thing is by the Waifu of turn, Hotaru, being the biggest attraction of the whole series, for its energetic personality and its attractive design.\\n\\n\r\nI have no desire to say much more, is another anime that starts as something harmless and ends up pathetically lowering all its theme and its character, to be able to create Fanservice situations that please even the last of the possible fetishes for disgusting Otakus, so that buy the DvDs and sleeves of these products.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you ask, will I see the second season that will come in January? Well ... I saw that he changed the studio (to a better one), and there was a design change (it's slightly different), however the trailer seems more of the same only with new characters, so I do not guarantee that to follow, and if so, I will only see the first episode to make some impressions, and if it is still in the same shit, I will give it its due Drop (unless of course I am wrong and there is an improvement).",

            "content": "Generally, the anime that I decide to review or watch have either been found by myself, or recommended by others. Dagashi Kashi followed the latter, as a few of my friends (knowing that I often review things) told me to check this anime out, saying that it was pretty good. And the sad part is that, though not bad by all means, because I went into it expecting more, Dagashi Kashi was disappointing.\r\nThe story is pretty much pointless, it rarely comes into play, and gets dropped after just a few episodes, so it's barely even worth mentioning.\r\nThe characters for the most part are fine, nothingreally that special, but they're still at least kind of likable. Kokonotsu is a serviceable main character, with ambitions and goals, and enough personality. Saya and Tou have a kind of fun brother and sister dynamic that makes them a bit interesting, but neither of them stand out too much. But, Hotaru is easily my favorite. She is very in your face and loud, but that's honestly what makes her stand out. She is a fun character because of her loudness and crazy personality. Most of the comedy in the show comes from her and her wild antics. Kokonotsu's father, You, is also a very fun character too, providing a good amount of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and music is pretty serviceable too, nothing special but it does the job.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was something I was really looking forward to. There are a lot of anime comedies that do a fantastic job, like Assassination Classroom, D-Frag, Sgt Frog, Space Dandy, and plenty of others. I was hoping I could put this one up there. But, unfortunately, the comedy feels a bit cluttered and unfocused, mainly because there are so many freaking food gags. The novelty of these gags wears off after a bit, and eventually I was just left watching and being mildly entertained, but I wasn't laughing. To be fair, the show can be funny, it isn't completely devoid of humor, but if it had focused more on other types of comedy and less on the food jokes, than it would've been better.\\n\\n\r\nAs it stands, Dagashi Kashi is.....fine. And for others, that is, well, fine. But for me, I was expecting and hoping for a bit more, for something good. And I was let down. But, I was at least entertained, so I can't say it was a waste of my time.\\n",

            "content": "I think Dagashi Kashi is underscored. It's a solid anime with good animation and character designs. The personality of the characters themselves may be 1 dimensional but for this type of gag anime I think works pretty well. Trying to judge this the same way one might Death Note or Monster or any other serious show I think is flawed.\r\nThere's is an ecchi element but its extremely subdued and very PG in the way that its done. It only gets revved up when there's a lull in anything interesting going on and thankfully it isn't constantly used as the main point of interest. \r\nI reallyenjoyed the relationships between the characters. They have really good chemistry together and often have very nice back and forths. All of their conversations and interaction deal with Dagashi which is basically candy for kids. And during these interactions I learned a lot about Dagashi and their history as well as what makes each of the Dagashi uniquely interesting beyond just their flavor. One of my favorite things I remember about Dagashi was when one character talked about how a certain Dagashi was designed to be eaten in a go-out-of-your-way type way because of how kids want to play with their candy and when they buy a Dagashi with their very limited funds they want to get as much out of it as possible. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole thing is very unabrasive with no mean spirited characters or any moments of cruelty or manipulation or anything of the sort. And if there is, its always just used as a gag and the \"manipulation\" fails.\\n\\n\r\nHighly recommend for someone that wants a light gag comedy without any story.",

It's interesting if you want to learn some more about Japanese culture with a focus on childhood and their special old-school candy, it's not that good if you read it for comedy even though you might get a laugh or two and some smiles. The story is pretty much non-existent, the characters are very, very few and they're created solely to make it possible to get away with just rambling on and on about candy facts. They're there for the candy. Makes me wonder if the author and the guys working on the anime get some donations or sponsoringfrom candy companies, which is probably the case. Back to the characters, they are quite flat and if you come her expecting story, go and watch or read something else, this is not going to be a good experience for you. \\n\\n\r\nIt is what it is, a nostalgia anime/manga about candy and childhood. People from Japan that has experienced these candy shops, especially if they grew up with them, will undoubtedly find this very good and be lost in the nostalgia trip. People from the outside will find it far less attractive with exception of those interested in Japanese culture and/or candy. I am personally interested in both their culture and food, so I actually found the anime and manga to be pretty interesting and good, but I have to rate it for what it is, the story is pretty much nonexistent (3/10), the art and sound is fairly good even if the art is special(7/10 on both), the characters are bland and not that interesting(4/10) and my own enjoyment was pretty good(7/10), so, it'll get an overall of 5.5-6/10 from me.",

Its cast is way too good compared to the rest of the show.\r\nI feel that the show could have been really good if it weren\u00b4t for its focus on the candy - the core component of the show. What we got is a series of 24 minute commercials for japanese sweets with occasional good parts, the moment when the focus was on the characters and not on the sweets. The cast consists of only 5 people with a strong focus on Kokonotsu and Hotaru. There is a reason that Hotaru has more favorites on MALthan the show itself, she is a great character. While it seems at the beginning that she has some sort of higher goal you realize later that while she certainly likes Kokonotsu, she will forever only have one love: candy. As the daughter of one of the biggest Japanese candy producers, she knows EVERYTHING about every candy in Japan. That\u00b4s why she wants Kokonotsu to take over the store of his father, he has to operate the store with his own big knowledge of candy. Because Kokonotsu has no intention at all to continue the store while still knowing a lot about it, the majority of the show consists of the two candy pros arguing about candy. That\u00b4s the reason why the show is rated so low: It can be quite boring at times to listen to them talking about chocolate for the twentieth time in a row. The real highlight are the times when they meet the rest of the cast, the siblings Saya and Tou: With Tou\u00b4s ability to be impressed by the simplest things and Saya\u00b4s crush on Kokonotsu and her being constantly annoyed about the childing behaviour of everyone, we have everything we need to have comedy. But the comedy of seeing everyone\u00b4s personality clash together is interrupted by candy commercials which can be funny at times, but often feel a few minutes too long.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design is good, everyone looks like you would expect them by their personalities while the minimalistic art makes them rememberable(look at Hotaru\u00b4s pupils) and the animation is quite good.\\n\\n\r\nDagashi Kashi is a show that I would recommend for the great characters and the comedy, if you can look behind the bad to mediocre story. Personally, I think that this season should have been a 15-minute short while the second season should have gotten full 24 minutes because they realized that people wanted more Hotaru and others and less of the candy talk.",

            "content": "want a good laugh at something that really makes no sense at all? Then I'd definitely say watch Dagashi Kashi. An anime about little to nothing aside from Japanese \"junk food\" or \"snacks\" and a girls drive to get a young boy to take over his dad family shop.\r\nNot only is her drive wild, shes literally driven by Dagashi itself. The characters were alright, typical middle school students on summer vacation doing what middle school students would do during summer break if you lived in the country side of Japan. \r\nAlthough aside from the summer festival, it seems nobody else lives in this small town,it did manage to give me a few laughs here and there making it more enjoyable. The story line was slim to none and it was left very open, but hey, who am i to criticize, right?",
